<F P=106> [Message issued by President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani in </F>
Tehran on 1 February marking the start of Islamic revolution 
anniversary celebrations -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
This moment is an historic and a very important occasion in our 
country's history. Our people do not forget those highly 
exciting days, when the nation was impatiently awaiting the 
return of the imam [Khomeyni] after years of exile and 
separation from the homeland. The enemies of our nation and 
agents of arrogance inside the country, who enjoyed a 
comfortable lifestyle, were concerned that with the imam's 
return their days of plundering and corruption would end. This 
moment coincides precsiely with the moment when the imam landed 
at the airport. 
  The government of the day had concentrated all its efforts 
on 
preventing the imam's arrival. On the other hand all the 
combative forces inside the country had concentrated all their 
efforts on realizing their old aspiration. The moment was 
highly exciting when the people found out that the imam's plane 
had come through various dangers to land safely at Mehrabad 
Airport. I think our artists and those talented in poetry and 
culture should draw suitable pictures to mark the occasion. The 
arrival of the new year is usually an exciting moment for our 
nation. Certainly the effects of this moment in our history are 
greater than those moments before the new year, so we have 
created certain ceremonies. 
  Let us look at the time before that moment and the period 
after it. If we look at the era before [Khomeyni's arrival], we 
see the rule of satan, the country's dependency, the presence of 
foreign advisers in Iran, abjectness, captivity, corruption, 
unrestrained behavior, the rule of aristocracy, and so on. 
Whereas on this side, we see the rule of God, rule by the 
people, the people's presence in the arena, independence, 
freedom, Islam, the Koran, improvement, piety and, in a word, 
the path of God. 
  It seems that our new generation should be made more 
familiar 
with the facts relating to both chapters of the country's 
history -- much more than what we have explained to them so far. 
These two chapters are: the era before the Imam's arrival and 
the chapter after that moment. 
  Our nation remembers that from the moment the imam stepped 
out of the plane, everything changed shape. Hopes gained much 
greater strength. The fear of the revolution's opponents 
intensified immensely, and the wheels of history rotated at a 
faster rate. The pages of history were turning so fast that no 
on could read the lines of history or even glance at them. 
After only a few days the foundations of monarchist tyranny 
collapsed and the foundations of the Islamic government, the 
popular government, were laid down. 
  May this occasion be a blessed occasion to our nation and 
may 
these historic moments remain honored in our history for ever.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 1, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani inaugurated the ceremonies marking the 15th 
anniversary of the victory of the 1979 Islamic revolution held 
in Imam Khomeyni's shrine in southern Tehran Tuesday [1 
February]. 
  Addressing a huge gathering of people and ranking state and 
military officials at Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, the president 
said that the massive presence of the people in all scenes of 
the Islamic revolution thwarted conspiracies of the enemies of 
Islam. 
  He said that the leadership of the late Imam Khomeyni and 
massive presence of the people were key factors in 
materialization of the revolution. The Islamic ummah must 
cherish these factors which resulted in the victory and grandeur 
of the Islamic society, Rafsanjani stressed. "Velayat-e Faqih 
(office of the religious jurisprudent) is the main motive in 
treading on our present path," said the president. 
  He noted that the important factor in the post-revolution 
era 
was to protect achievements of the Islamic revolution. These 
achievements have been preserved despite eight years of the 
Iraqi-imposed war and propaganda ploys of the enemies of Islam. 
At the meantime, he continued major steps have been taken 
towards achievement of independence, freedom and progress.

  [Text] Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hajj Seyyed Ahmad 
Khomeyni spoke today at the ceremonies marking the anniversary 
of imam's return. In his speech Ahmad Khomeyni describes 
exceptional virtues of the late imam. He said: What 
distinguishes the imam, may God be satisfied with his deeds, 
from others, was his sincerity. From the first day of the 
struggle, his eminence imam used to speak to the people 
sincerely; there was never a gap between the people and the imam. 
  About the sincere and decisive approach of the founder of 
the 
Islamic Republic of Iran [Imam Khomeyni] vis-a-vis state 
problems and difficulties during his life, Ahmad Khomeyni said: 
Fifteen years after the Islamic revolution victory, this 
revolution is still subjected to onslaught of the aliens. Our 
responsible authorities, including the esteemed leader 
[Khamene'i], the president, and other officials, continue the 
path wished by the late Imam. 
  In another part of his remarks, referring to the 
revolutionary and Islamic movements all over the world, he said: 
The enemies accuse the Muslims of being fundamentalists. If 
following the instructions of Islam's prophet is interpreted as 
fundamentalism, then the Muslims are proud of this.

  [Excerpts] Reports received about the special ceremonies 
marking the Ten Days of Dawn state that a few hours before the 
start of the ceremonies, different strata of the population, 
religious and political figures, and foreign guests of the 
occasion, gathered at the immaculate shrine of the departed 
Imam, to honor the memories of this blessed day and to renew 
allegiance with the aspirations of the great Khomeyni. 
  At the splendid ceremonies, President 'Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in the course of remarks, described the 
reasons for the victory of the revolution and the survival of 
the Islamic Revolution. [passage omitted] 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni also spoke about the 
special characteristics of Imam Khomeyni. 
  Our correspondent Ruhani-Nezhad reports on the president's 
speech at these ceremonies. 
  [Ruhani-Nezhad] In his speech Hashemi-Rafsanjani honored the 
memory of his eminence, the imam [Khomeyni] -- may his soul be 
admitted to paradise -- the founder of the Islamic Revolution of 
Iran, and praised the epic-makings and self-sacrifices of Iran's 
revolutionary people. He described the Ten Days of Dawn as the 
real feast of Iran's Muslim nation and all the deprived Muslims 
of the world. He said: During the blessed Ten Days of Dawn, 
the Almighty's blessings and favors were displayed in a manner 
never before seen during the length of our history, in all their 
glory and greatness. The president pointed to the factors 
making for the victory of this great development during the 
current century and noted that the life-giving Islamic doctrine 
and the important principle of the velayat-e faqih and 
leadership were the most important factors in achieving victory. 
He said: With the passing of incidents, events, and the trend 
of the Islamic Revolution, this fact has been proven that 
motivation by a doctrine, people's belief in Islam, and 
society's full confidence and trust in the leadership, not only 
led this great movement to victory but also played an important 
role in its preservation, survival, and continuation until today. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: The destiny-making and important 
events following the victory of the Islamic Revolution, that is, 
the imposed war, the economic boycott and many other plots, each 
of which could have left an impact on the Revolution's 
direction, were all foiled and rendered ineffective, thanks to 
the virtuous leadership of his holiness the imam -- may his soul 
be admitted to paradise -- and the rational measures of his 
eminence, Ayatollah Khamene'i, respected leader of the Islamic 
Revolution, and the extensive and enthusiastic presence of the 
people on all the arenas of the Revolution. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasized: In order to strengthen and 
stabilize the Islamic system all the more and to strengthen 
economic development and completely cut our ties of dependence, 
we should fully follow the eminent leader of the revolution and 
be present on the scene to defend the aspirations and valuable 
heritage that was passed down to us by his holiness the imam.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] In his annual address to Congress, U.S. President 
Bill Clinton finally admitted that crime and lack of security 
are at the head of American society's problems. Reacting to 
strong congressional criticism of the growing crime and violence 
crisis in the United States, Clinton pointed out that a bill to 
add 100,000 policemen to confront violence and crime has been 
approved. But he did not make any promises on this force's 
capability to curb the growth in everyday crime. 
  Earlier, unprecedented congressional efforts to convince the 
government to adopt measures to prevent crime and address the 
lack of security indicate that American society needs serious 
efforts, now more than ever, to fight crime. The growing crime 
rate, lack of security, and improper conduct have drawn the 
public's attention to this national crisis. THE NEW YORK TIMES 
wrote that Americans today are vulnerable to murders, beatings, 
assaults, robberies, and other frightful crimes and that no 
place is safe from crime and assaults. The paper remarked that 
the more dreadful reality is too hard to follow up or report. 
  Statistics published by different American organizations and 
institutions indicate that there is a national catastrophe. 
According to a report by the American Child Protection Society, 
the United States went through its most violent period between 
1978 and 1991 because of growing crime. A total of 150,000 
persons under 20 years of age were killed with firearms during 
that period. Studies by health authorities also indicate that 
murders exceed road accidents; the number of people killed with 
weapons in the past 22 years is much higher than those killed in 
road accidents. In other words, murders increased by 60 percent 
between 1968 and 1991, while the number of people killed in road 
accidents dropped by 21 percent during the same period. Murder 
with various weapons will become the number one killer in nine 
years, by the year 2003. 
  Therefore, the media are urging religious leaders, 
academics, 
civil and social rights leaders, and ordinary citizens, 
particularly parents, to find ways to confront this national 
crisis. Sociologists believe that the American people are today 
experiencing an identity crisis because the prevailing social 
system has destroyed American humanitarian and ethical values. 
This lack of identity is due to the fact that the American 
people suffer from a sense of loss and feel that they are living 
in a world of carelessness, dreadful ignorance, and fear. 
  The growing violence and the resulting social crisis in 
America indicate that by adopting the wrong policies, the people 
running the country's affairs have failed to avert a historic 
crisis. It is thus surprising that the U.S. President some time 
ago claimed that America should lead the world. A question 
comes to mind here: How can a state whose president admits that 
crime and lack of security are at the head of its problems be in 
charge of the world's security and administration?

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Turkey's Air Attack on Zeli Camp </F>
in Iraq"] 
  [Text] The ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY has reported that Turkey's 
military aircraft carried out 52 sorties against the Zeli Camp 
in northern Iraq, which is 110 km from the Turkish border. 
According to the news agency, the objective of the air attack 
was to completely destroy the Zeli Camp, in which 1,600 Kurdish 
opponents of the Turkish Government were sheltered. 
  Considering the fact that, in the past, Turkish aircraft had 
hit targets up to 20 km into northern Iraq at most, this was the 
first time they penetrated to bomb positions of the Kurdish 
Workers Party [PKK] deep inside northern Iraq. Referring to the 
latest operations against the PKK, Turkish Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller said: As far as the struggle waged against the PKK is 
concerned, 1994 is an important year. 
  Political observers believe that Ankara has launched a new 
phase in Turkey's operations against the PKK militants. 
Although, similar operations were carried out against the PKK 
in the past, Ankara's move to intensify the Turkish cross-border 
operations indicates that it is mostly worried by the 
developments in northern Iraq. However, several political 
observers are convinced that Ankara is more worried about the 
overt and covert policies of the European countries. They are 
also convinced that the fact that European countries give 
support to the Kurds in Iraq while remaining indifferent to the 
Turkish Government's suppression of the Kurds in Turkey accords 
with the policies of those Western Governments. The same 
observers believe that, considering the fact that the United 
States and the European countries act according to their own 
political interests, the Turkish officials are seeking several 
guarantees from the Western countries. The banning of the PKK's 
activities by the Bonn and Paris governments is regarded as in 
accord with Ankara's wishes. 
  However, the Turkish officials are still believed to be 
worried by the activities of the Kurds, who are opposed to the 
Turkish and Iraqi Governments. Considering this state of 
affairs, several political observers are convinced that the 
Ankara Government's military moves against the Kurds will not be 
successful. Therefore, they believe that political talks will 
be the most effective means of resolving the PKK problem. 
Undoubtedly, the Turkish Government's cross-border operations 
against northern Iraq violate the territorial integrity of Iraq, 
which is an independent country. Furthermore, if such operations 
continue, they may harm security and stability in the region. 
In view of this, the settlement of the problems in the region 
through cooperation among the regional countries without foreign 
interference would promote security in the region.

  [Text] Orumiyeh, W. Azerbaijan Prov., Feb. 1, IRNA--A 
Turkish delegation on Monday [31 January] visited the victims of 
the last Friday bombardment of two villages in Sardasht by the 
Turkish jet fighters, hospitalized in this northwestern city. 
  The delegation headed by Turkey's Foreign Ministry director 
general for political affairs, Ogur Dugan, arrived here Monday 
to inspect the bombarded areas, visit the wounded and estimate 
the damage caused on the villages. 
  Talking to the victims the Turkish envoy expressed his 
government's deep regret over the incident. 
  Those injured, some in critical condition, gave a detailed 
account of the sudden attack of the Turkish warplanes on 
Qasemrash region of Sardasht, West Azerbaijan Province, and 
called on Iranian Government to follow up the issue. 
  The delegation also met with Deputy Governor General of the 
province Mohammad Ashtari. 
  Dugan described as irrational statement of the Turkish 
officials that they had informed the Iranian Government of the 
raid beforehand. He added that upon return he will make it 
known that such claims were unfounded. 
  Ashtari strongly protested the statement of the Turkish 
authorities and said in light of the formation of border 
security commissions and frequent exchange of visits between the 
two countries' officials in the past eighteen months, Tehran has 
always introduced Ankara as a friendly neighbor and a brother. 
However, he added, the attack raises serious questions in the 
mind of the public. 
  The Turkish official expressed deep regret over the incident 
and hoped that such incidents will be repeated in future. 
[sentence as received] 
  The Turkish delegation is to leave for Sardasht later today.

<F P=106> [Political commentary: "The Seminar on the Trend of </F>
Development in Central Asia and the Caucasus"] 
  [Text] On the second day of its sessions yesterday, the 
international seminar on development in Central Asia and the 
Caucasus continued its debates on various issues of regional 
cooperation and the outlook for Central Asia and the Caucasus. 
  During yesterday's sessions, the seminar, which included one 
general and one specialized sitting, was addressed by a group of 
experts and scholars from Iran and other participating 
countries. Each one presented his viewpoint on the various 
issues under discussion at the seminar. 
  Mahmud Va'ezi, deputy foreign minister for Euro-American 
Affairs, was among the speakers in the Tuesday morning session 
at the seminar. He elaborated on the collaboration in the 
process of construction in Central Asian countries. 
  He stressed the need to establish tranquillity and stability 
in the region as one of the main principles and said that 
internal, external, or ethnic strife impedes growth and 
development. 
  The need to establish security, tranquillity, and stability 
in Central Asia and the Caucasus was among the topics focused on 
by the other speakers. The head of the Kyrgyzstan Science 
Academy, (Turkoychev), also spoke on this subject. He said that 
the continued war in some of the Central Asian Republics does 
affect their independence and called for the termination of all 
such conflicts as the most fundamental prerequisite for 
development. He also stressed that in the event of economic 
unity among these countries, they would become an important 
economic lever to be reckoned with. 
  In general, during the various sessions of this 
international 
seminar, the process of development in Central Asia and the 
Caucasus was discussed from various vantage points, including 
cultural, political, economic dimensions. Each of these topics, 
which have an impact on defining the future trend of regional 
development, merit attention because of their fundamental and 
noteworthy role. 
  Thus, as shown by the activities of this seminar and the 
remarks made by the participants from other countries, including 
Russia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, the United States, and Iran, at 
the session yesterday, it can be stated that this information on 
the events in the countries in the region can be effectively and 
practically used in any subsequent reviews of the problems in 
the region and in planning for its future development.

  [Text] Paris, 30 Jan (INA)--Mas'ud Rajavi, chairman of the 
Iranian National Resistance Council, has strongly condemned the 
statements made by the so-called Hasan Ruhani, secretary of the 
so-called Iranian Supreme Council for National Security, 
regarding the Iranian regime's plan to destroy rebel positions 
abroad. 
  In a cable addressed to the UN secretary general as well as 
the chairman and members of the UN Security Council, Rajavi said 
that these impudent statements clearly show the regime's 
intentions to launch military attacks on the bases of the 
Iranian National Liberation Army, and to carry out terrorist 
operations against resistance elements outside Iran--something 
that reflects the exacerbation of domestic crises, as well as 
increasing popular discontent with the regime's henchmen. 
  Rajavi urged the international community to enforce a 
sweeping arms and oil embargo against the Iranian regime. He 
indicated that a regime that advocates terrorism outside its own 
borders should have no place among the international community 
of nations.

  [Text] [Announcer] In its open session today the Majles 
approved the generalities of the national budget for the year 
1373 [beginning 21 March] with an absolute majority. Our 
correspondent reports. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Today's Majles open session and 
the continuing debate on the bill for next year's national 
budget were addressed initially by Rouqani Zanjani, the head of 
the plan and budget organization. 
  Emphasizing the need to reduce the country's budget 
dependency on oil income and to move toward other sources of 
income, he said: In drawing up next year's budget, the 
government has tried to provide for the greater part of the 
country's expenditure through tax incomes and to allocate oil 
income for development projects. 
  Pointing out that the income obtained from the increase in 
fuel and energy prices must be used for oil related development 
projects, he stressed: If Note 25 of the budget bill is dropped 
the projects will come to a stop. 
  Zanjani described the increase in fuel and energy prices to 
be within the context of implementing social justice and said: 
One of the reasons that progress is not taking place in 
industry and technology, in particular the production of 
vehicles, is the availability of cheap fuel in the country. 
  The head of the plan and budget organization also said that 
the reduction in the budget's income ceiling was the cause for 
the stoppage of a number of development projects in the country 
and reminded the deputies that: In drawing up next year's 
national budget, the government has set aside many of the 
projects and has reduced the number of national development 
projects in comparison to projects in provinces. 
  The oil minister also addressed the session on Note 25 of 
the 
budget bill, which concerns the increase in fuel and energy 
prices. 
  He said: We are presently paying a 11,000 billion rial fuel 
subsidy and if this process continues and we fail to find a 
solution, we will have more problems in the next development 
plan. 
  Speaking on the need to end the increase in fuel 
consumption, 
he said: In the second development plan we have looked into all 
possible solutions that could end consumption growth and we 
welcome any other solution that might reduce consumption. 
  Referring to the view of the Majles joint commission -- on 
plan and budget, economic and financial affairs and cooperatives 
-- regarding the adjustment of fuel and energy prices, he said: 
If the commission's suggestion is approved we will have to set 
aside some 700 billion rials of development projects in the oil 
industry. 
  He then referred to the negative effects of setting aside 
these projects. 
  [Announcer] In the continuation of the Majles open session, 
Energy Minister Bijan Namdar-Zangeneh pointed out that the 
average monthly income for home consumers is 180 kilowatts [kw], 
but two thirds use less than 180 kw. 
  According to a commission decision, the price increase will 
not effect consumption up to 500 kw, and 96.6 percent of 
consumers will not be effected; furthermore the price increase 
does not effect agricultural usage or 99 percent of hot regions, 
he said. 
  He clarified that the electric energy price increase will 
effect less than one percent of the industry. 
  Stating that an annual 2.1 trillion rial subsidy is being 
paid for electricity, the energy minister said: Social justice 
does not demand payment of such subsidies or more subsidy for 
bigger consumers. 
  Zangeneh said the proposed increase in electricity rates 
would be spent on implementing projects for the oil industry and 
reminded the deputies that otherwise, many of the projects that 
are sources of employment will come to a stop. 
  In today's open session, Mohammad Gharazi, the minister for 
post, telegraph, and telephone also spoke about the increase in 
the volume of activity in post and communications as well as 
improvement in service provided for the public. 
  He said: You can rest assured that people will pay if you 
provide the various services for them. The country is an arena 
for development and people want progress. He emphasized: 
Movement must be such as to allow a change from subsidizing to 
permanent investment. 
  The report by our correspondent indicates that following the 
10-hour period allocated for speeches by deputies for and 
against, as well as explanations given by the joint commission 
and government representatives on the principles of next year's 
national budget bill, voting was held and the bill was approved 
in principle. 
  As required by Majles regulations following the approval of 
the bill in principle, the review of proposals by Majles 
commissions and deputies regarding the budget incomes started. 
  Today's open Majles session had a break at noon and 
deliberations on the proposals followed after the restart at 
1400.

cultural facilities within their workshops for the employees. 
The tax charge will be 12,000 rials per employee per year. All

before tax, from last year, to provision of teaching and 
training centers and university grants for the children of their 
employees. 
  The country's municipalities are dutybound to allocate two 
percent of their income before tax for the year 1373 to 
provision of teaching and training centres and university grants 
for the children of their employees. 
  The Ministry of Education and Training is permitted to sell 
all or parts of its lands, administrative premises or teaching 
buildings at the market price; and deposit the income from the 
sale to the Treasury account. 
  Our correspondent reports that according to one of the 
sections on income in the ninth note of the national budget 
bill, the law enforcement forces will be allowed to receive and 
transfer to government purse up to 10 billion rials from the 
sale of movable and immovable property. 
  They are also allowed to receive and transfer up to 15,000 
rials from every vehicle through the program for the change of 
vehicle number plates. 
  The law enforcement forces are allowed to issue vehicle 
inspection documents and to receive and transfer to government 
purse a minimum of 500 rials and a maximum of 3,000 rials for 
each vehicle. 
  The customs office is also responsible to levy a 5 rial tax 
on every imported cigarette and 200 rials on every kilo of 
pistachio export. 
  The study of the budget bill will continue in today's third 
open session which will start at 1900.

  [Text] The Islamic Majles resumed its open session at 1900 
hours on Sunday. During this session some proposals of the 
deputies and Majles commissions were approved on revenue figures 
of the budget bill for the year 1373 [Iranian year beginning 21 
March 1994]. On the basis of these proposals various 
ministries, state organizations, and companies are permitted to 
hire out or sell at least 20 percent of their vehicles so as to 
meet their service costs in the year 1373. The said 
organizations are obliged to sell at least 12 percent of their 
equipment, which are not fully utilized, to the value of 400 
billion rials in the year 1373. The income from such sales 
should be deposited in the state general revenue account. 
  On the basis of another ratified note, in the year 1373 all 
imported goods should be registered. The registration fee for 
the essential commodities is five rials per every dollar, or its 
equivalent in other hard currencies, of the commodity's value. 
For the non-essential commodities the registration fee is 40 
rials per dollar. 
  Any person importing a vehicle, in addition to the existing 
taxes and customs charges, should pay 10 percent of the basic 
value of the vehicle to obtain a number plate for the vehicle. 
  On the basis of another ratified note, any passenger 
entering 
the country, even from the free ports, can import goods up to 
the value of 150,000 rials without having to pay customs charges 
and tariffs. 
  According to our correspondent's report, on the basis of the 
notes approved during this session of the Islamic Majles, in 
order to improve the quality of higher education and for more 
efficient utilization of the country's educational 
establishments, higher education institutes are allowed to 
charge the students who fail some subjects. That is, if a 
student fails in one or several subjects, he must pay cash or 
promise to pay later all the charges incurred by the state to 
enable him to repeat the subjects. The universities and the 
research and higher education institutes are also permitted to 
let their premises and facilities at the fair market rate, 
provided their own research works and operations are not 
undermined.

  [Excerpts] With the approval of Majles deputies, any 
increase in 1373 [1994-5] in prices, taxes, subscription fees, 
application and connection charges, and any other charges 
relating to electricity, telephone, post, and subscription 
charges for agricultural water is forbidden. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In the second session of the 
Majles, which was held at 1400 hours today, proposals by Majles 
committees and deputies regarding the revenues section of the 
Budget Bill for next year were debated, and a number of 
proposals were approved. 
  Under the approvals of the session, the average postal 
charge 
for any package is set at 100 rials, including 25 rials tax. 
Also, local and trunk telephone calls will be charged according 
to 1372 [1993-4] tariffs. As an incentive to subscribers, the 
Communications Company is to adopt special international tariffs 
during [off-peak] hours when the company receives international 
discounts. 
  Also, any increase is forbidden in 1373 in prices, taxes, 
subscription charges, connection and application charges, and 
any other charges relating to electricity, telephone, post and 
subscription charge for agricultural water, except for cases 
mentioned in the clause. [passage omitted] 
  Under another approval the equivalent of 50 percent of the 
price of properties -- up to 5 trillion rials -- which the 
Intelligence Ministry obtains in the course of its legal 
activities, which is calculated as the country's general 
revenues, is to be placed at the disposal of the ministry. 
  The Intelligence Ministry is also to pay into the Treasury, 
toward the country's general revenues, the domestic and foreign 
currency earned in the course of its legal activities, from 
financial misappropriations, bribes, and sale of intelligence. 
  Under another approval the country's overall commercial and 
foreign currency policies in 1373 should be such that the total 
of the country's foreign currency commitments are 1.6 billion 
dollars less at the end of 1373 than they are at the beginning 
of 1373. 
  The Central Bank is also to convert into rials -- 85 percent 
at the floating exchange rate and 15 percent at the official 
exchange rate at the end of Esfand 1371 [February-March 1992] -- 
the foreign currency obtained from the sale of every oil 
consignment or oil by-products on receipt of the foreign 
currency, and pay the sums obtained into the country's general 
revenues' account. [passage omitted on headquarters for 
reconstruction of war-damaged zones and fisheries to sell some 
of their assets and pay the sums into the Treasury; taxes on 
various sectors including hotels, tourism, printing, tobacco, 
sports, and unspecified airport tax]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mas'ud Roghani Zanjani, the Iranian vice </F>
president and head of the Budget and Planning Organization, by 
an unidentified correspondent on 31 January; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Following the Islamic Majles debate of the budget 
bill for the year 1373 [1994-94] today, our correspondent 
interviewed Mr. Mas'ud Roghani Zanjani, the vice president and 
the head of the Budget and Planning Organization. We draw our 
dear viewers attention to this interview. 
  [Correspondent] The deputies and various commissions of the 
Islamic Majles have proposed amendments to the Budget Bill for 
the year 1373, some of which were ratified. The Majles has 
approved the ceiling for the revenue earned from the sale of 
oil, and also the revenue from taxation. I would like to ask 
Mr. Masud Roghani Zanjani to explain the government's revenue 
for the year 1373 and the effect of the Majles amendments. 
  [Zanjani] Up until now, that is 725 [figure not further 
clarified], the total revenue originally proposed by the 
government is reduced by 3 trillion rials. Since we are in the 
second reading of the expenditure debate, it is not yet clear 
how the esteemed Majles intends to distribute the cut among 
various departments. No doubt there will be some cuts in the 
current expenditure and some in the [long-term] development 
plans. It is certainly clear that if we were to put this into 
practice, it would be impossible to implement some of the 
country's current plans. We have to wait and see what policies 
the Majles will adopt vis-a-vis the expenditure now that revenue 
is reduced. 
  [Correspondent] What sort of price have you envisaged for a 
barrel of oil to reach the figure of revenue ceiling from the 
oil sale? And what will be the daily production figure? 
  [Zanjani] The Majles has compiled the budget at [estimated 
figure of] 13 dollars [per barrel]; whereas the government's 
figure was different. For the same reason the oil revenue is 
reduced. 
  [Correspondent] What about taxation? 
  [Zanjani] The Majles has proposed increased taxation figure. 
That is, we had proposed taxation revenue of 6.4 trillion 
[rials]; whereas, the esteemed Majles has proposed 7.88 trillion 
rials for the time being. The figure has not been finalized yet.

  [Text] Following reports by one of the evening newspapers 
regarding a ban on the speech by Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin 
'Ali Akbar Mohtashami in Sari, our correspondent contacted him 
for clarification on this matter. 
  Mohtashami said: A month ago, the Hezbollah center invited 
me to speak on the occasion of the approaching auspicious Ten 
Day Dawn. Ten days ago, one of the members of the center 
contacted me and said that local officials objected to my 
addressing the center and did not consider it expedient. He 
then told me that it was the governor general himself who 
objected and created problems, so that my scheduled speech would 
be canceled. The governor general informed the center that if 
the event was not canceled, law enforcement officials would stop 
it. 
  Mohtashami was asked: Did you complain to the relevant 
authorities? 
  Mohtashami said: I do not know whether there are any 
relevant authorities for such a complaint! In principle, a 
complaint about the governor general should be made to the 
interior minister. However, when the minister himself bans a 
legal march by students, and then openly defends his action and 
condemns the students in an address to the Majles, how can I 
complain to him?! In response to a question on whether the 
Hezbollah center in Sari has lodged an official complaint, 
Mohtashami stated: It is unlikely that the center would do so. 
Those at the center are employed in various organizations and 
institutions and if they display any resistance, their 
employment can be terminated. 
  In response to a question on whether Mohtashami received an 
apology from officials, he replied in the negative and added: 
The center was threatened with complete closure if such a 
speech were made.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 1, IRNA -- The daily `TEHRAN TIMES' 
Tuesday recommended the newly-selected Algerian president to 
unconditionally release Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj if he 
wishes to show sincerity regarding a national reconciliation. 
  General Liamine Zeroual was selected by the Algerian High 
Security Council as the new president Sunday. 
  The English daily said that Zeroual enjoys a good reputation 
compared to the five members of the current unelected collective 
presidency. "Nevertheless, his presidency cannot bring 
legitimacy to the Algerian regime." 
  Noting that the Algerian problem is of a politico-military 
nature, the editorial said "Algeria's efforts to destroy its 
domestic opposition and to accuse other countries of interfering 
in its internal affairs have met with failure. 
  "If Zeroual truly wants a national reconciliation...He 
should 
realize that his time to legitimize his own presidency and the 
Algerian Goverment is limited. 
  The process of legitimization must take place soon or the 
current conflict would blow up into a full-fledged civil war, 
the daily added. 
  "This legitimacy must be approved by the people of Algeria, 
not by Paris or Washington," wrote the editorial.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The murder of an Iranian 
pastor, Hayk Hovsepian, whose body was recovered recently, was 
connected with the religious activities of the small Protestant 
sect he led, Hovsepian's relatives told AFP Monday [31 January]. 
  One member of the victim's family, requesting anonymity, 
said 
the leader of the "Assembly of God" had felt he was "in danger 
since he brought to the world's attention in January the case of 
fellow Assembly of God pastor Mehdi Dibaj, originally a Moslem, 
who was sentenced to death for having converted". 
  Hovsepian disappeared on January 19 while he was travelling 
by car to Tehran airport. 
  Police photographs of his body, shown to the family, 
indicated wounds to the abdomen and chest. 
  The body was found the following day in a street in the 
Eslamabad area, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Tehran. 
  However, the family said they were not informed of 
Hovsepian's death until Sunday, and they were unable to see the 
body, because it was buried unusually quickly at Tehran's huge 
Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery. 
  On Monday they were granted permission to bury the body with 
a religious ceremony at a Protestant cemetery. 
  No official account was given to the family about the 
circumstances of Hovsepian's death, the authorities saying 
simply that an investigation was in progress. 
  Another relative who requested anonymity said Hovsepian "had 
no enemies -- the only problem was that he led the Assembly of 
God." 
  "Our church is very active in trying to spread the message 
of 
the Bible, and the government asked us to stop propagating our 
religion," the relative said, adding that the authorities 
recently closed several of the Protestant sect's places of 
worship, after it refused to stop spreading the faith. 
  The sect says it has some 3,000 members in Iran. 
  Several of its members told AFP that the Assembly of God 
followers had been subjected to "pressure and intimidation" from 
the authorities throughout Iran in recent months. 
  Relatives said Hovsepian's death was connected with his 
campaign to alert the world community to the case of Mehdi 
Dibaj, detained for nine years and recently sentenced to death, 
according to the Assembly of God, for having converted to 
Christianity. 
  Dibaj was freed on bail on January 15 following 
international 
pressure, particularly from the Vatican and other European 
countries, including France. 
  The Iranian authorities denied that Dibaj had been sentenced 
to death, and said he was simply accused of "offences against 
the Moslem Prophet (Mohammad) and Imam (Ayatollah) Khomeyni", 
founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

<F P=106> [Speech by Youcef Khatib, chairman of the National Dialogue </F>
Commission, at the swearing-in ceremony of new President Liamine 
Zeroual in Algiers--live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate: 
Gentlemen, ladies: After the establishment of the Higher State 
Council, which worked for the adoption of dialogue as a way to 
solve the country's problems, dialogue was given a new push for 
political life. The results of this dialogue were a draft 
proposal of a platform which did not receive the required 
support. However, we ought to address our thanks and 
appreciation to the members of the Higher State Council who 
shouldered this responsibility in very difficult circumstances. 
Thus, the Higher State Council supported a good initiative 
which was manifested in the setting up of the National Dialogue 
Commission whose efforts led to the platform for the management 
of the transitional phase which encompassed all the remarks, 
views, and proposals of the sides involved in the dialogue, and 
was crowned with the convening of the conference on national 
consensus. This conference was held despite the absence of and 
hesitation by some parties. Its success was guaranteed by the 
participation of the living forces which are represented in some 
parties and economic and social organizations, and led to 
positive and actual results. 
  Gentlemen, ladies: Dialogue is the most important method of 
success. It will continue to be the only way to achieve gains 
in the future and is the most exemplary means for solving the 
country's current problems. Mr. President, on this 
distinguished and promising occasion we wish you total success, 
beseeching God Almighty to inspire you with the correct view and 
ensure security, stability, progress, and prosperity for 
Algeria. May God render us successful for the good of the 
country and people. Peace and God's mercy and blessings be upon 
you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Address by Ali Kafi, chairman of the Higher State Council, </F>
at the swearing-in ceremony for new President Liamine Zeroual in 
Algiers--live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Mr. Liamine Zeroual has now been sworn 
in according to Articles 72 and 73 of the Constitution, as well 
as to Article 8 of the national dialogue document [as heard]. 
Right now, Mr. Ali Kafi, chairman of the Higher State Council, 
whose official functions have just ended after President Liamine 
Zeroual's swearing in, is going to the platform, and it seems 
that he is getting ready to make a speech. He is now asking the 
guests, who have been standing up during the swearing in, to sit 
down. 
  [Ali Kafi] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. [Koranic verse] Dear brothers, we meet on this 
historic day in the march of modern Algeria. This is the first 
time in Algeria, and perhaps in many countries, where 
alternation of political power is taking place in a civilized 
way, which honors the Algerian citizen and puts him in the 
position he deserves. 
  Brothers, the Higher State Council, true to its pledge, 
hands 
power over satisfactorily and on time to its replacement. The 
Higher State Council, as you know, took office in difficult 
conditions and stopped the danger. 
  Today we have to give hope to the Algerian people who 
suffered during these last years. These people have been crying 
silently and patiently. 
  We all must bring smiles and joy back in order to save our 
nation and people, who have waited for this occasion for so 
long. Therefore, we must not waste time in restoring smiles to 
lips and in traveling the road to construction where the 
aspirations of this nation, these people, and the growing 
generations will be reflected. 
  Brothers, I am not standing before you today to deliver a 
long speech, but I stand here to end my task as chairman of the 
Higher State Council and the task of the members of the Higher 
State Council, and to hand over this trust to one of the sons of 
deep-rooted, revolutionary Algeria, one of the sons of the 1 
November Revolution; I mean brother Liamine Zeroual [applause], 
who takes this heavy task upon his shoulder. The members of the 
Higher State Council and I wish the brother President Liamine 
Zeroual well in discharging this task, but we do not say to him 
what the Israelites said to Moses, peace be upon him: You and 
your God go and fight; we are staying right here [Koranic verse]. 
  In fact we say to him: Proceed with God's blessings; we are 
all recruited and mobilized for the sake of making the country 
successful and taking it out of this tribulation. [applause] I 
wish, through this gathering and this honorable ceremony, to 
praise and thank the authentic Algerian people for being patient 
and steadfast in the face of these shake-ups which from time to 
time placed us in a critical position. I hope that we will come 
out of these shake-ups because we are all rational and because 
of our love for our homeland. I would also like to thank all of 
the cadres and all who cooperated with us in order to arrive at 
this great event. May Almighty God render us all successful and 
may God give President Liamine Zeroual success in this task. 
Thank you. [applause]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We have met with a number of 
guests and recorded their reaction to the appointment of Liamine 
Zeroual as head of state, on the sidelines of the swearing-in 
ceremony. Their reaction was as follows: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] We are expecting 
things to start to happen after this appointment. What is 
important today is what the man of the transitional period will 
do rather than who is in charge of the transitional period. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Kamel Laroussi, you are a 
leading member of the Islamic Nahda Movement. What is your 
reaction? 
  [Laroussi] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. The leader of the movement already answered this 
question when he said that the appointment of Liamine Zeroual to 
lead the country during this period came about first because he 
was a member of the National Liberation Army. However, what we 
are hoping will take place during the next phase is that he will 
work in accordance with the consensus reached by the parties, in 
a bid to bring about national reconciliation. Thank you. 
  [Correspondent] Ahmed Mahsas is a historic figure and at the 
same time he is leader of the Union of Democratic Forces. Mr. 
Mahsas, what is your reaction to the appointment of Liamine 
Zeroual as head of state? 
  [Mahsas] Of course we, as a political movement, did not take 
part in the dialogue for certain reasons. However, as far as 
state issues are concerned our concern is to correct the 
foundations of the state. We believe that the appointment of 
brother Liamine Zeroual is a positive move in this decisive 
period. He has shouldered a colossal responsibility. Such an 
appointment may be able to stop the serious deterioration if 
measures are taken that will make the Algerian people feel that 
something new is taking place. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Mahsas. Mr. Abdelkader 
Merbah, leader of the Majd party, will you give us your reaction 
to the appointment of Liamine Zeroual as head of state? 
  [Merbah] I said in my news conference on 23 December that 
there were some signs for a positive change. I was then trying 
to hint to Liamine Zeroual as well as other officials of the 
state. Thanks be to God, time has shown that I was right. We 
are very happy at the appointment of Liamine Zeroual as head of 
state because we think he is committed to making a clean break 
with the past, and he is a fair and strong man. A strong 
Algeria needs strong men to set the house in order. Algerians 
were desperate. We hope that our despair is over with the 
appointment of men like Zeroual to lead the country. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The appointment of Mr. Liamine Zeroual as head of 
state has been received with satisfaction by a number of 
political parties and organizations, who have described it as an 
initiative of hope aimed at overcoming the crisis in the 
country, by opening a comprehensive and serious dialogue. With 
Louisa Hadj Moussa for more details: 
  [Begin Moussa recording] Shaykh Mahfoud Nahna, the leader of 
the Islamic Society Movement, HAMAS, has indicated that Mr. 
Liamine Zeroual, who has been chosen to assume the duties of 
head of state, must open the door to dialogue in order to 
restore hope and confidence to the Algerians. He added that he 
preferred a comprehensive dialogue that would end the discord. 
  Many other parties and political organizations have 
announced 
their support for the new head of state. In a joint statement 
released after the swearing in ceremony, these parties have 
explained their position by saying that Mr. Liamine Zeroual is 
regarded as the man who represented the break with the obsolete 
methods that have led the country to the present situation. 
These parties have urged the new head of state to work toward 
restoring order and safety, and to act within the framework of 
the constitution and the 1 November Declaration. The parties 
that have signed the statement are: The Islamic Arab 
Boumedienist Front, the Social Movement for Authenticity, the 
National Salvation Front, the Rally for National Unity, the 
National Movement for Nature and Development, the Front of 
Popular Forces, the Union for Progress and Liberties, the 
Democratic Progressive Party, the Front of the Independence 
Generations, the National Party for Solidarity and Development, 
and the Party of Science, Justice, and Action. 
  The General Confederation of Algerian Economic Operators 
also 
welcomed the appointment of Mr. Liamine Zeroual as head of state 
and affirmed its full support for him. The confederation said 
it regarded this appointment as a victory for the supporters of 
a comprehensive and serious dialogue. The Friendship 
Association of Algerians in Europe has expressed its 
satisfaction, and said it hoped to see civil peace and political 
stability prevail in Algeria after the appointment of Mr. 
Liamine Zeroual at the head of the Algerian state. The 
association added that it regarded Mr. Zeroual as a man of 
renewal and consensus. [end recording]

  [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, the curfew in Kupwara town 
has been relaxed for four hours from 1000 this morning following 
an improvement in the situation. The curfew was imposed on 
Thursday evening following violent incidents resulting in the 
death of 18 persons, including three policemen. The state 
government has already ordered an inquiry into the incident. 
Ex-gratia payment to the next of kin of those killed has also 
been announced. 
  The union home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, says the first 
priority with the central government is to end militancy in 
Jammu and Kashmir. Addressing a rally in Jammu today, he 
appealed to all political parties to shed their individual 
differences and join hands to help restore normalcy in the 
state. He said once militancy is contained, the state can go in 
for elections. 
  Mr. Chavan said Jammu, Ladakh, and Kashmir will remain 
integral parts of Jammu and Kashmir as much as the state remains 
an integral part of India. Mr. Chavan said Pakistan's efforts 
to divide people in the name of religion and incite militancy 
will never succeed. He said a new thinking has already emerged 
among the masses who are fed up with the activities of the 
militants. He assured the people that all necessary security 
will be provided for those who work in the valley. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the pradesh [state] Congress-I 
president, Mr. Ghulam Rasool Kar, suggested that a political 
adviser be appointed in Jammu and Kashmir State. A check of 
125,000 rupees was presented on behalf of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Pradesh Congress-I Committee to Mr. Chavan for the victims of 
the Maharashtra earthquake. Mr. Chavan is scheduled to visit 
some camps of Kashmir migrants near Jammu this afternoon.

  [Text] The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, has said that 
Pakistan has no moral right to raise the issue of alleged human 
rights violations in Kashmir, because Islamabad is mainly 
responsible for creating the present problem in the valley. 
Addressing a news conference in Jammu this afternoon, he said 
the recent call by Pakistan for a general strike is another 
proof of its support to the militants. The home minister said 
that Pakistan totally forgets that the worst kind of human 
rights violations have been perpetrated by its forces in its own 
province of Sindh and other areas. Mr. Chavan said that steps 
have been taken to counter the Pakistani disinformation campaign 
on the issue. Nonofficial organizations from India will be 
visiting different countries to put the record straight, he 
said. The home minister said that the Army has ordered an 
inquiry into the recent incident at Kupwara. Its findings will 
be made public. Replying to questions, Mr. Chavan said the 
government does not propose to appoint political advisers in 
Jammu and Kashmir. He said elections will be held in the state 
at an appropriate time. Government is prepared to hold 
negotiations with any group in the valley which is willing to 
discuss the matter within the framework of the constitution and 
is prepared to give up violence. Mr. Chavan said he has had 
discussions with different political parties separately adding 
that he may call a joint meeting of all parties on this issue. 
  The home minister today completed a three-day tour of Jammu, 
Doda, Kishtwar. During his visit, he met a large number of 
people and leaders of political parties. He said the people 
have appreciated the induction of additional security forces in 
the area where some foreign mercenaries have also become active. 
Mr. Chavan also reviewed during his tour the financial problems 
of Jammu and Kashmir at meetings with the state governor and 
senior officials.

  [Text] The union home minister has underlined the need for 
initiating a vigorous political process in Jammu and Kashmir. 
Mr. S.B. Chavan was talking to newsmen in Jammu at the end of a 
three-day tour of Jammu, Doda and Kishtwar. Asked about holding 
elections in the state, he said the possibility of the state 
going to the polls in the near future cannot be ruled out, but 
there is no timeframe for it, he added. In a reply to another 
question, the home minister said the Center has no package for 
initiating the political process in the state. Mr. Chavan said 
Kashmir is a national issue and no party should take advantage 
of it. 
  The monthly cash relief for the Kashmiri migrants has been 
increased by 50 percent. The relief per family will now be 
1,500 rupees instead of 1,000 rupees. This was announced by the 
home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, in Jammu. 
  Agency reports from Jammu say militants opened fire when the 
helicopter of the home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, was landing at 
Doda yesterday. The reports quoting official sources say the 
militants fired from a hilltop at (Deoli) about 3 km from Doda. 
The security forces returned the fire silencing the guns of the 
militants. The militants could not cause any damage as they 
fired the shots from quite a distance. 
  The union minister of state for home, Mr. Rajesh Pilot, says 
the government will not allow agencies like the Inter-Services 
Intelligence of Pakistan to succeed in their evil designs. 
Addressing a rally in Gandhinagar yesterday, he said Pakistan is 
interfering in our internal affairs and it does not want the law 
and order situation to improve in the Kashmir valley. The 
minister made it clear that tough action will be taken against 
the forces which are bent upon breaking the unity of the country.

  [Text] An official spokesman today strongly refuted press 
reports that the union home minister's helicopter was fired at 
during his visit to Doda yesterday. The spokesman said that no 
such incident concerning the home minister's helicopter took 
place during his visit to Doda and Kishtwar yesterday. However, 
militants fired a few rounds from a very distant place from Doda 
town, which were not aimed at the helicopter or any particular 
object. Moreover, the home minister's helicopter landed much 
later than this random firing.

  [Text] Pakistani troops again fired six rockets from 
across the border in Mendhar Sector of Punch District in Jammu 
and Kashmir yesterday. No damage is reported. According to 
official sources, Pakistani troops have been firing rockets on 
the Indian side without any provocation for the last four days. 
  The president of the All-India Youth Congress-I, Mr. 
Maninderjit Singh Bitta, has said that Youth Congress-I 
activists will demonstrate near the Indo-Pakistan border at 
Atari on the fifth of next month. Addressing a rally in 
Bhubaneswar, he said this is to rebuff the three-day strike call 
given by Pakistan Premier Ms. Benazir Bhutto in that country on 
the Kashmir issue.

<F P=106> [UNITED NEWS OF INDIA report] </F>
  [Text] Bombay, Jan. 21 -- The Tarapur Atomic Power Station 
(TAPS) will switch over to indigenously developed mixed oxide 
fuel (MOX) in a phased manner from its next refuelling stage in 
February, shedding its dependence on imported enriched uranium 
for power generation, Nuclear Power Corporation managing 
director S.K. Chatterjee said on Thursday. 
  Mr. Chatterjee told news persons that this would be the 
first 
experiment of partly using the indigenous fuel to operate the 
Tarapur Atomic Power Plant in view of the uncertainty about 
renewal of supply of enriched uranium from France under the 
India-U.S.- France tripartite agreement which ended in October. 
  He said that to begin with, two bundles of mixed oxide fuel 
along uranium stock from the previous contract was over, would 
start using a mix of low-enriched uranium and MOX at the TAPS. 
  Mr. Chatterjee said "We are [as published] no fuel problem 
till the end of 2,000 AD." 
  However, he said the options for procuring enriched uranium 
would continue to be explored. "We would buy it from whosoever 
was willing to give it to us," he said while asserting that 
"enriched uranium or no enriched uranium, we have to, and will 
run TAPS and have uninterrupted power generation". 
  Mr. Chatterjee said the Atomic Energy Commission chairman 
had 
already said that India had the capacity to run the two units of 
TAPS project -- one indigenously -- and also had the capability 
to produce enriched uranium. 
  Indian scientists had fully perfected the art of producing 
MOX and using it as a substitute to enriched uranium for 
operation TAPS. 
  Mr. Chatterjee said TAPS would complete successful operation 
of 25 years on April 1, 1994 and enter into the 26th year. "We 
will run it for another 14 years." 
  He said the safety assessment for renewal of operations had 
already been completed by SARRA [expansion unknown] after 
inspection.

  [Text] The Palestine Liberation Organization leader, Yasir 
'Arafat, says he hopes to sign an agreement next week on a first 
Israeli troop withdrawal from the occupied territories. Mr. 
'Arafat told the United Nations Human Rights Commission in 
Geneva that he would hold further talks with the Israeli foreign 
minister, Shim'on Peres, in the Egyptian capital, Cairo. 
However, Israel has played down hopes of a final agreement on 
implementing Palestinian self-rule. The Israeli prime minister, 
Yitzhaq Rabin, said time was needed to overcome differences, 
while one official said an accord could be weeks away. 
  Mr. 'Arafat said on Monday [31 January] that a total 
agreement had been reached at talks in the Swiss resort of 
Davos, but that Mr. Peres asked for more time to study details 
of the text. In his speech to the Human Rights Commission he 
said the Palestinians were still suffering abuses in the 
occupied territories.

  [Excerpt] The Palestine Liberation Organization leader 
Yasir 'Arafat has warned that further delays in the withdrawal 
of Israeli troops from the occupied territories could threaten 
the whole Middle East peace process. Mr. 'Arafat told a news 
conference in Geneva that Israel had asked for six days to 
review a weekend agreement reached with the Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres in the Swiss resort of Davos. He was 
speaking shortly after giving a speech to the UN Human Rights 
Commission, in which he said Palestinians still faced abuses in 
the occupied territories. The PLO leader said he still hoped 
the agreement on implementing Palestinian self-rule could be 
signed next week when he meets Mr. Peres in the Egyptian 
capital, Cairo. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Describing the continued gross human rights 
violations against innocent and unarmed Kashmiris as reminiscent 
of the darkest days of the holocaust and the situation in Bosnia 
as grave and appalling, Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto urged 
the comity of nations to uphold the universal declaration of 
human rights which is often extensively violated with impunity. 
She was addressing the 50th session of the commission on human 
rights in Geneva today. 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] Two-thirds of Kashmir has remained 
under Indian occupation for the past 45 years. India first 
accepted but then refused to implement the UN Security Council 
resolution calling for a plebiscite under UN auspices. Over 
40,000 -- 40,000 -- Kashmiri men, women, and children have died. 
The martyrs' graves in Srinagar are flowing over as are the 
tears of the Kashmiri mothers, wives, and daughters. Despite 
its repression, India has failed to impose its will on the 
indomitable people of Jammu and Kashmir. The intensity of the 
resistance has grown. The Kashmiri political leadership 
representing over 30 parties and groups has unanimously declared 
that it will not contemplate any solution which implies the 
continuation of Indian rule. Their demand is simple -- Azadi, 
freedom. People cannot be suppressed indefinitely, tyranny 
cannot long endure. That is the lesson of history. The 
situation in Kashmir is as intolerable as is the world silent. 
  It is time for the world community to prevail upon India to 
remove the additional forces it has put into Kashmir to conduct 
its campaign of repression. It is time for the world community 
to demand that India leaves its draconian emergency laws which 
allow its Army to commit atrocities in Kashmir without being 
answerable to anyone. 
  The settlement of the Kashmir dispute based on the wishes of 
its people is the key to peace and progress in South Asia, South 
Asia which is home to one-fifth of humanity. We cannot 
celebrate the triumph of the universal declaration on rights. 
These rights are being violated extensively often with impunity 
without compunction, or conscience or remorse in almost every 
part of the world. [end recording] 
  About Bosnia, the prime minister urged the world community 
to 
help preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Bosnia. The consequences of ethnic cleansing must be reversed, 
she stressed.

  [Text] The former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. 
Farooq Abdullah, has dismissed Pakistan's accusations of 
widespread human rights violations in India. Exercising India's 
right to reply to the Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto's, statement on Kashmir, Dr. Abdullah reminded Islamabad 
of the plight of the Ahmediyas, the Shi'ites and other minority 
communities in Pakistan. Addressing the opening session of the 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva, he observed that India always 
stood by its pledge and commitment of giving equal rights to all 
citizens. Dr. Abdullah asserted that Kashmir was and will 
remain a part of India. 
  In a BBC interview later, he accused Pakistan of fomenting 
insurgency in Kashmir. He said India wants peace, but Pakistan 
is not responding to the offer.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will meet U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in a few hours to update 
him on the progress made in the Davos talks. Meanwhile, the 
bilateral talks between the Israeli, Syrian, Lebanese, and 
Palestinian delegations continue in Washington. Our 
correspondent Natan Gutman reports from Washington: 
  [Begin recording] [Gutman] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
arrived at his Washington hotel a short time ago. From what he 
told us, it appears that Mr. Peres is slightly less optimistic 
than Yasir 'Arafat concerning the chances of signing an 
agreement next week. I asked Shim'on Peres whether he shares 
'Arafat's assessment that an agreement can be signed within a 
week: 
  [Peres] I am participating in the negotiations, and that is 
enough for me. I hope we will reach an agreement, but I do not 
want to commit myself to a precise day or week. 
  [Gutman] What will take place in Cairo next week? 
  [Peres] We have to finalize several more issues, some of 
which relate to the contents of the agreement, others to the 
formulation of the issues on which agreement has been reached. 
  [Gutman] Upon his arrival in Washington, Foreign Minister 
Peres confirmed that Yasir 'Arafat told him in Davos that the 
Palestinians are not interested in an independent Palestinian 
state at the present time. 'Arafat told Peres at the opening of 
their meeting: You are afraid we want to establish a 
Palestinian state right now, but in fact we have decided to 
proceed toward a confederation rather than a Palestinian state. 
This is what 'Arafat told Peres at the opening of their meeting 
in Davos. 
  Foreign Minister Peres will meet Secretary of State 
Christopher in about three hours, and tomorrow he will meet Vice 
President Gore. The talks between the Israeli and Syrian 
delegations will open in about half an hour -- a breakthrough on 
this track is not expected to take place today. [end recording]

  [Text] The Arab-Israeli talks are continuing in Washington 
in secret. Another meeting is expected between Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat next week. 
The situation can be summed up as follows: There is no 
progress on the bilateral tracks and the talks on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track are delayed. Our correspondent in 
Washington Salim Salim reported to the Voice of Lebanon bureau 
in Washington that the Israeli delegation insists on a peace 
agreement with Lebanon before discussing Security Council 
Resolution 425. Also, the Israeli delegation insists on secret 
talks with Syria before lifting the veto on the Golan. The 
report did not rule out direct U.S. intercession in the talks 
this week. 
  [Begin Salim recording] There is nothing new regarding the 
Arab-Israeli talks being held at the heads-of-delegation level, 
which began their second week without results worth mentioning. 
Why did the talks fail to make progress? We put the question 
to the delegations participating in the talks and to the U.S. 
State Department. It seems clear that failure to make progress 
on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks is due to the following 
reasons: On the Lebanese track, Israel will not pledge to 
implement Resolution 425 before Lebanon declares its readiness 
to accept a bilateral peace treaty. As for the failure on the 
Syrian track, Israel will not declare its readiness to withdraw 
from the Golan until after Damascus agrees to negotiate with 
Israel secretly, as the Israelis and Palestinians did in Oslo 
recently. Damascus rejects this. 
  The Voice of Lebanon has learned that Itamar Rabinovich, 
Israeli ambassador and head of the negotiating delegation with 
Syria, asked U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to 
convince Syria to agree to secret talks. The U.S. stance was 
cautious and the U.S. side did not show any enthusiasm for this 
formula. This caused the talks at the heads-of-delegation level 
to bog down. Direct U.S. intercession beginning in the middle 
of this week cannot be ruled out if chronic and traditional 
obstacles are not resolved among the Lebanese, Syrian, and 
Israeli delegations. [end recording]

  The two sides are due to meet again to finalise an accord on 
launching Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, 
following the meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last weekend 
between PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres.

  [Text] Gulf sources have disclosed that a meeting was held 
in London last Sunday [23 January] between Qatari Foreign 
Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres and Minister of Energy Shahal [title as received]. 
They discussed ways to supply Israel with gas, an issue which 
AL-ANWAR has mentioned before. 
  The sources said the talks took place without the knowledge 
or consent of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose territory the 
gas pipes must pass through to reach Israel. 
  Asked by AL-ANWAR of his view on these talks, a Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] official said he had not heard about 
these contacts and meetings before. Any developments between 
Qatar and Israel, he added, are absolutely not in accord with 
GCC policy.

<F P=106> [Rafiq Khalil al-Ma'luf report: "Qatar Officially Confirms </F>
Plan To Supply Israel With Gas"] 
  [Text] Washington--Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Al Than announced yesterday that the development of 
Qatari-Israeli relations is linked with the scale of progress in 
the negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. He denied 
that Qatar's policy toward Israel is aimed against any of its 
neighbors. However, he said that this policy is independent and 
that there are "differences between us and the other Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] states in this connection, but they 
are not major differences." The Qatari minister confirmed that 
he met with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres last Sunday. 
He also confirmed that Qatar is making contacts with Israel 
regarding a natural gas deal, but it will not begin 
implementation before progress is achieved in the peace process 
with Syria and Lebanon. He indicated that Qatar may 
independently decide to abolish the second- and third-degree 
boycott of Israel if progress occurs in the negotiations. 
However, he associated the abolition of the main boycott with a 
decision from the Arab League. 
  In a news conference he held yesterday after his talks with 
U.S. officials, especially with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, Shaykh Hamad said that Qatar has special interests 
in developing the peace process and making it a success. He 
expressed his hope that progress would be made on the Syrian and 
Lebanese tracks in 1994. He said: "We hope that the peace 
process will lead to the establishment of a new order and a new 
Middle East free from bloodshed...." 
  He expressed satisfaction with the fact that the 
Palestinians 
and Israelis have sat together to resolve their differences 
directly and with support from the United States and Russia. He 
said that at the end of April Qatar will host a round of the 
multilateral negotiations and will receive Israeli diplomats 
like other diplomats. "And we feel that our people will welcome 
that, because the aim is peace and an end to bloodshed." 
  Asked whether he had managed to conclude a gas deal with the 
Israelis in London, he said: "True, a meeting was held in 
London, but so far we have not concluded a gas deal...." He 
pointed out that the Israelis know well "Qatar's position and 
its terms, as we clearly said that we want progress to be made 
in the peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks..." He 
added, "We are thinking about a deal, but nothing has been 
achieved." 
  Asked whether his country "is playing with fire" with its 
neighbors in terms of its policy with Israel, the Qatari 
minister said that "it is exciting sometimes to play with fire. 
But this should be done safely. However, we do not believe 
that our relations with Israel are aimed against any of our 
neighbors. Qatar has good relations with Iraq and Iran and also 
with the other GCC states. Of course we have some problems with 
our neighbors, but it does not mean that we are doing things 
deliberately...." 
  Asked whether Qatar consulted or coordinated with its GCC 
neighbors over its new policy toward Israel, he said: "It is 
our policy and I can only speak about Qatar...." He said that 
"we have differences with the GCC states, but they are not major 
differences, and as I said, it is our policy." 
  Shaykh Hamad disclosed that he had discussed with 
Christopher 
the issue of Qatar's relations with Iran and Iraq and that he 
had told the U.S. secretary that "Iran is one of Qatar's 
neighbors. We clearly told the secretary of state that we wish 
to establish good relations with Iran...so that the opposite 
will emerge." [sentence as published] He said that Secretary 
Christopher understood the Qatari position because Qatar and 
Iran are "close neighbors."

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The United Arab Emirates 
has formally lifted a long-standing boycott of South Africa, 
opening the door for Pretoria to grab a bigger share of the 
Middle East market, UAE officials said Sunday. 
  The federal cabinet decided to end the 19-year-old ban and 
has instructed public and private institutions that obstacles no 
longer existed for dealing with South Africa, they sa?d. 
  Diplomats said the cabinet decision to end the boyco?t would 
pave the way for establishment of diplomatic ties between the 
UAE and South Africa. 
  The Dubai-based daily AL-BAYAN said the cabinet decision 
cancelled a 1975 federal law banning any form of dealing with 
South Africa because of its former system of apartheid. 
  The decision coincides with Pretoria's attempts to enter the 
Gulf market, which is dominated by Japan, western countries and 
other industrial powers. 
  South Africa's drive has already produced results. Its trade 
with the UAE surged to around 150 million dirhams (40.8 million 
dollars) in 1993 from less than 20 million dirhams (5.4 million 
dollars) in 1992. 
  Officials from both sides expect trade to grow steadily in 
coming years given their large business potential. 
  "South Africa enjoys great economic and trade potentials," 
the director of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
'Abd-al- Rahman al-Mutaywi, said after returning Saturday from a 
business trip to Johannesburg. 
  He said South Africa planned another major trade exhibition 
in Dubai in May following the success of its first Middle East 
fair in 1992. 
  Officials said South Africa was still planning to open a 
commercial office in the United Arab Emirate of Dubayy to boost 
exports to Iran and the GCC states of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, 
Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE. 
  South Africa is also aiming at the region's growing arms 
market and has participated in two international defence shows 
in the UAE.

  [Excerpt] Sanaa -- Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 
the Yemeni deputy prime minister and chairman of the committee 
preparing for a reconciliation session between President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has announced 
that, barring unforeseen difficulties, he will travel to Amman 
next Thursday to prepare for the signing of the document of 
understanding initialed by leaders of the country's parties and 
independent figures in Aden 18 January. 
  Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, a key figure in the national dialogue 
that spawned the document of understanding to be signed by the 
Yemeni president and his deputy in Amman next week, indicated 
that agreement has been reached as to which local, Arab, and 
other parties will be invited to attend the signing ceremonies. 
  Since the accord was initialed, the General People's 
Congress 
[GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] have differed over 
which Arab and other states to invite for the event. 
  While the YSP wants Britain, France, the United States, 
Eritrea, Canada, and China to be present along with Oman, Saudi 
Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and the Arab League, the GPC prefers a 
restricted attendance. 
  Abu-Shawarib said that agreement has been reached to invite 
five Yemeni figures from the three ruling coalition partners: 
the GPC, the YSP, and the Reform Party, a representative from 
each of the parties that sat on the dialogue committee, 
including the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, al-Haqq Party, and the 
Yemeni Reform Grouping, plus a limited number of independents.

<F P=106> [Report by Kamal Jaballah in Sanaa] </F>
  [Text] A ranking Yemeni Government official has announced 
that the General People's Congress [GPC] set the return of 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, vice president and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP], and Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas to Sanaa to assume their duties as a condition for 
signing the "Pledge and Accord" document outside Yemen. 
  The official, who asked not to be identified, said that if 
the document is not signed before the month of Ramadan 
[approximately 10 February] it will mean that the YSP is buying 
more time to prepare for separation. In his statement to 
AL-AHRAM, the official expected a violent military confrontation 
between the two sides if the crisis is not resolved. He noted 
that YSP media are now paving the way for separation. 
  The official's statement coincided with growing speculation 
by politicians and observers in Sanaa that the antagonist 
political forces are preparing to divide Yemen once again into 
two parts and perhaps more, as Hadhramaut is expected to secede 
from the southern part. Informed Yemeni sources that asked to 
remain anonymous said separation is now a matter of time and of 
who will bear the responsibility before history and the Yemeni 
people. 
  The sources said: The two poles of government, the GPC and 
the YSP, are accusing each other not only of escalating the 
crisis but of actually preparing for military confrontation if 
separation intentions come true. 
  The sources said that before inaugurating the Hadhramaut oil 
project, the YSP raised the cost of the project by $300 million 
without the Council of Ministers or the Presidential Council 
knowing about it. The additional money, according to the 
sources, was used to buy weapons and ammunition in preparation 
for the possible confrontation. For its part, the YSP accused 
the GPC of buying some $20 million worth of weapons and 
ammunition from Romania without the knowledge of the prime 
minister, who belongs to the YSP.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Feb (MENA)--Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has revealed wide differences among the 
parties competing for authority in his country. He accused the 
political powers involved in the ruling process of adopting a 
harsh, centralized, and backward approach to running the 
country's affairs. He said this confirms that there is no desire 
to unify institutions, but rather to maintain the status quo. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM to be published on 2 February, 
al-'Attas said he rejected an offer by Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih to join the General People's Congress to avoid 
further division within the Yemeni Socialist Party. 
  Al-'Attas affirmed that there are military movements in the 
two sections of Yemen, particularly after the suspension of all 
projects to rebuild, restructure, and unite the Armed Forces 
since the declaration of unity on 22 May. 
  The Yemeni prime minister accused the state of collaborating 
with terrorists to strike at rival political forces in the local 
arena. He noted that the terrorist elements in Yemen are being 
used in operations at home and abroad. 
  Asked when he would return to Sanaa, al-'Attas said: Soon, 
once we reach full agreement on the security arrangements and 
the legal and constitutional guarantees that aim to rearrange 
affairs and establish peace and stability in Yemen.

<F P=106> [Jamal Khashuqji report: "Rabih Kebir Tells AL-HAYAH: </F>
Salvation Front's Position on Zeroual Appointment Has Not Been 
Defined Yet"] 
  [Text] Jeddah -- The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] in 
Algeria stressed yesterday that "it has not yet taken a specific 
position on the appointment of Defense Minister Liamine Zeroual 
as president of the country." Rabeh Kebir, chairman of the FIS 
Executive Committee abroad, said in a statement to AL-HAYAH: "We 
cannot say whether what has happened (Zeroual's appointment) is 
positive or negative. We are not interested in individuals but 
in the policy to be pursued by Zeroual. We will be able to 
judge when the features of this policy become clear." 
  He pointed out that the statement he issued the day before 
yesterday, in which he attacked the Algerian authorities, was 
not aimed against the new president, Zeroual. But it "expresses 
our fixed position rejecting all attempts by putschists to 
prolong the life of their regime, which has become bankrupt at 
all levels. We in the FIS are waiting until Zeroual's policy 
becomes clear so that we can pass judgment." However, he 
reiterated the FIS' position of refusing to recognize the 
regime's legitimacy. He said: "We do not forget that the 
present regime, like the previous one, is a military regime that 
lacks constitutional and popular legitimacy." 
  Asked whether he had found in Zeroual's speech any positive 
indications of a desire for reconciliation, he said: "Zeroual's 
speech -- as we heard it -- included both the reconciliation 
aspect and the terrorist aspect, so I reiterate that his policy 
is still unclear." 
  Kebir does not expect recent changes to affect the military 
activities of elements of the armed Islamic movement supporting 
FIS, which are now called the Islamic Salvation Army, "until 
after the new president's policy becomes clear." On the effect 
of recent contacts between the Algerian authorities and the 
detained FIS leaders on the other FIS leaders, especially those 
present abroad, he said: "We stressed in the past that the 
legitimate and historic FIS leadership is represented in Shayk 
Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, and it pleases us to see that 
contacts are conducted with them to extricate the country from 
the crisis. But these contacts should be based on good 
foundations that restore the Algerian people's dignity and their 
right to live under the Islamic state they have chosen." He 
said that detained FIS leaders who have been contacted stressed 
to representatives of the authorities that "we are part of the 
leadership but not all the leadership. We must be allowed to 
meet with the other brothers concerned. Then we will be able to 
take the right legitimate position." He pointed out that the 
contacts made were merely discussions, not a dialogue as the 
detained leaders were reported to have said. 
  In a statement issued last Sunday Kebir condemned in FIS' 
name the assassination of Shayk Mohamed Bouslimani, describing 
it as "part of a campaign designed to drive a wedge between 
Islamists." Official Algerian reports said yesterday that the 
"Armed Islamic Group" (Ja'far al-Afghani's group) had claimed 
responsibility for the assassination of Bouslimani, who is close 
to Hamas [Islamic Society Movement]. And that the assassination 
order was issued by al-Afghani himself. However, Shayk Rabeh 
Kebir told AL-HAYAH: "Our information indicates that it was the 
authorities' organs which abducted Shayk Bouslimani and 
committed the crime. The so-called Free Algerian Youth 
Organization claimed responsibility for the operation. This 
organization is known to be a branch of the intelligence 
service."

  [Text] A delegation of Algerian financial experts will be 
going to Washington in the near future to continue and complete 
negotiations with the IMF with a view to arriving at an 
agreement on a cut in the servicing of debts in return for a 
program for structural reforms to the national economy. In 
principle, this new round of talks, recently described by 
Economy Minister Mr. Mourad Benachenhou as an occasion for real 
negotiations, is expected to conclude the two consultative 
rounds started since the inauguration of Mr. Redha Malek's 
government last September on a rigorous financial policy that 
Algeria should adopt if it wanted to secure support from the 
international financial community. 
  The signing this month of a letter of intent, i.e. a 
document 
in which the authorities present the program of economic reforms 
for the coming years, is a matter on which Algeria is pinning a 
great deal of hope as the sole means of cutting the payment of 
its debts so as to start economic revival. The economy minister 
did state to THE WASHINGTON POST three days ago that there was 
no other way if we wanted to avoid a rise in inflation and a 
total collapse of the economic system. 
  This type of agreement with the IMF imposes, in return for 
the rescheduling of debts, a series of conditions which have 
adverse effects at the social level. But Algeria hopes to 
secure a sort of special treatment, taking into consideration 
the political circumstances the country is going through. In 
this respect, Benachenhou expressed a great confidence as he 
stated in Algiers that the file of negotiations was under 
control, and the government was trying to persuade the IMF to 
take into account the exceptional situation in Algeria. He had 
also already stated at the beginning of the year: we will be 
negotiating firmly with the IMF to arrive at a harmonious 
financing program without overlooking social repercussions.

  [Text] At a meeting between the General Union of Algerian 
Workers [UGTA] and the national federations of all the sectors, 
UGTA Secretary General Abdelhak Benhamouda revealed the 
objectives of the UGTA during the transitional phase and 
stressed that the UGTA's demands at the forthcoming negotiations 
with the government would be for higher wages. (Djemal Nazzar) 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [(Nazzar)] The UGTA is meeting the 
national 
federations of all the sectors. The meeting is taking place to 
assess, coordinate, and make preparations for the congresses of 
some federations. This meeting, the first of its kind, has come 
late, according to the UGTA secretary general, in view of the 
UGTA's many national activities, particularly its participation 
in talks with the government, contributions to the political 
dialogue, and participation in the national concord [wifaq] 
conference. The secretary general briefed the trade union 
cadres on the results of the conference; he also talked about 
the role of the workers in the transitional phase. 
  [Benhamouda] Our role as the General Union of Algerian 
Workers is naturally to contribute to strengthening and 
supporting the state. However, what is important to us is 
rebuilding the economy; to rebuild it as a strong economy so 
that we can protect our workers. 
  [Nazzar] The UGTA's negotiations with the government 
received 
the lion's share of time in discussions. Abdelhak Benhamouda 
talked about another new point that would be raised at the 
forthcoming negotiations with the government. Again, the point 
concerns a salary increase. 
  [Benhamouda] We will be starting additional negotiations 
when 
we submit this file to the head of government. The negotiations 
will address the difference [between the UGTA demand and the 
government's offer], because the treasury minister said only 8 
billion [currency not specified] while we had agreed on 32 
billion. Therefore, we will demand a salary increase in the 
next phase. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Mr. Abdelhak Benhamouda, secretary general of 
the General Union of Algerian Workers [UGTA], said today that 
the UGTA has agreed to the resumption of negotiations with 
international financial institutions. He added that he is also 
prepared to accept a devaluation of the dinar provided that 
practical measures are taken to help improve productivity and 
reduce the unemployment and inflation rates. During this 
meeting, Mr. Benhamouda also confirmed that 200,000 workers 
could be made redundant in the next two years. He added that a 
significant number of jobs would be made available in 1995, 
particularly in the sectors of public works, construction, 
irrigation, textiles, and food industries. This, he said, will 
reduce unemployment by a considerable extent. 
  Regarding the efficiency of the unemployment fund, Mr. 
Benhamouda indicated that this resides in the possibility for 
redundant workers to receive social benefits, such as social and 
health security during the legal period, in addition to the 
unemployment benefit which could range between 2,000 and 5,000 
dinars. This, he added, will reduce the deficit which the 
social security fund and the pension fund are complaining about. 
  The UGTA secretary general also talked about the positive 
aspects of early retirement which would alleviate the burden 
caused by a surplus of workforce, and other burdens which are 
weighing down the enterprises. He added that the success of the 
early retirement scheme depends on the existence of a firm 
economic and investment policy which would provide the 
conditions for growth. 
  Massoud Ramdani interviewed Abdelhak Benhamouda and asked 
him 
about the agreement recently signed with the government. 
  [Begin Behamouda recording] We regarded the agreement signed 
on 17 January as a beginning for organizing future negotiation. 
For example, in the context of the 17 January agreement we said 
that we will not open the wages file. We agreed to the minimum 
because there must be stages and a gradual progress. If we do 
not define a secure minimum national level for wages, we will 
not be able to open the wages file. [passage omitted] 
  We have agreed on the issue of an unemployment fund but we 
have not yet finalized it. The same applies to an early 
retirement fund. We have also talked about a national fund for 
social services. We have agreed on all these issues but we have 
not agreed on the details. [end recording]

that has recently grieved the entire community of journalists 
overseas and considers it as a practice alien to Algeria's 
traditions. [passage omitted]: 
  The statement made clear that the two reporters went to the 
Casbah quarter without taking into consideration the 
instructions of the authorities. It added that a police patrol 
had come across them yesterday at Bab El Oued and advised them 
not to go to some areas without taking the necessary precautions. 
  The two reporters who came to Algeria to cover the national 
conference wanted to complete their work by doing some field 
investigations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Port Sudan, 31 Jan (SUNA) -- The president of the 
republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, has said that the 
government will not be indifferent toward Garang, who has 
rejected peace and would not heed the voice of reason and come 
to negotiations. He pointed out that the Armed Forces and the 
People's Defense Forces were capable of protecting the homeland 
and deterring those who intended to cause it harm. 
  He said this yesterday when addressing a big rally at Port 
Sudan, Eastern State, on the occasion marking the promotion of 
5,000 recruits of the People's Defense Force. He affirmed that 
the revolution from the outset had declared that it would 
surrender power to the people. It had now undertaken to 
redivide the states, following acceptance by the states' 
salvation committees, representatives of the governorates and 
local councils in a conference recently held in Khartoum on the 
basis of a new vision. Al-Bashir saluted the people of the Red 
Sea area for their bold stand and unity.

  [Text] Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, minister of social planning, 
has reaffirmed the Sudanese Government's commitment to deliver 
relief to those affected in the south of the country. His 
Excellency added while addressing the Foreign Ministry forum 
today that the government has been carrying out this 
humanitarian duty since the agreement was reached with the 
United Nations on organizing Operation Lifeline. He pointed out 
that the government had sent a delegation to Nairobi to discuss 
the organization of safe corridors with the rebel movement in 
order to deliver relief to the needy in their areas. Ali Osman 
Mohamed Taha said the rebel movement refused to open the roads 
in the areas which it controls. 
  He added that in confirmation of its good intentions to stop 
the war and achieve a lasting peace, the government had 
responded to the request of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to 
hold a meeting composed of a delegation from the government with 
the rebel Garang as a preliminary step for new negotiations. 
However, the rebel Garang (?reneged on his promise) [words 
indistinct] which proves his lack of seriousness in the quest 
for peace. He pointed out that government had fulfilled all its 
commitments and is striving to solve the problem. Its contacts 
and efforts are also still continuing and are open to those who 
are eager to move the peace process forward which has become the 
will of all the Sudanese people.

state but rather about a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation, 
'Arafat was referring to a confederation between two states. 
This is the best practical solution for us, al-Husayni

  Al-Husayni told Qol Yisra'el that a confederation agreement 
with Jordan would be possible only after the Palestinians and 
the Jordanians approved it in a national referendum.

  [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who is on a 
visit to Washington, has expressed hope that a final agreement 
will be reached with the Palestinians in the coming week. Peres 
disclosed that Yasir 'Arafat informed him in Davos that the PLO 
leadership does not work toward establishing a Palestinian 
state, but seeks to set up a confederation with Jordan. Peres 
added that 'Arafat told him that Fatah and other Palestinian 
organizations, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril, 
support confederation. 
  George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for 
the 
Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], said that this stand reiterates 
that the Gaza-Jericho accord constitutes, to the PLO leadership, 
the ceiling of the final solution to the Palestine question. 
  The PFLP-GC categorically denied that it has informed 
'Arafat 
of its support for confederation. Our correspondent Sana' 
al-Imam reports from Damascus: 
  [Begin al-Imam recording] The PFLP-GC has denied Peres' 
statement in which he cited PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat [on 
PFLP-GC's support for confederation]. A PFLP-GC official 
spokesman said: What 'Arafat is saying is absolutely baseless. 
He added that 'Arafat has no right to speak on behalf of the 
PFLP-GC or any Palestinian citizen after all active factions and 
forces in the Palestinian arena have deprived him of his 
legitimacy. The PFLP-GC spokesman added that the organizational 
and political relationship between the front and 'Arafat has 
been severed since 1982 and that the PFLP-GC's position is still 
based on the strategy of armed struggle to liberate the 
Palestinian territory and restore the national and historical 
rights. 
  Commenting on the issue of confederation and 'Arafat's 
relinquishment of establishing an independent state, PFLP 
Secretary General George Habash noted that this reiterates that 
the Gaza-Jericho accord constitutes, to 'Arafat and his team, 
the ceiling of the Palestinian solution. He added that the 
Palestinian people will not agree on setting up a confederation 
or federation with Jordan or any other Arab state, noting that 
'Arafat's remarks mean transferring administrative rule to 
Jordan and aim at reassuring Israel. [end recording]

adding: I wish to pursue my national position through this 
independence. 
  Five days ago, Hawatimah extended an invitation, through the

opposition. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Riyad Mansur] </F>
  [Excerpts] A Fatah military official has strongly rejected 
proposals presented by the Palestinian leadership to Israel in 
Davos on joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols on the borders with 
Jordan and Egypt. He described these proposals as a way to 
beautify the Oslo accord, noting that this means giving 
sovereignty to Israel. 
  In response to a question by SAWT AL-SHA'B, Staff Major 
General Muhammad Jihad, who is also a member of the Fatah 
Central Committee, called on all Fatah military cadres to reject 
these proposals and warned against the consequences of 
attempting to coordinate with the Israeli Army on these patrols. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked about instructions from the Palestinian leadership to 
Fatah cadres inside the occupied Arab territories to surrender 
their weapons to the Israeli Army and stop military operations, 
Jihad said: I asked President Yasir 'Arafat about this and he 
categorically denied issuing such instructions. Jihad 
reaffirmed that the Fatah Central Committee did not issue any 
such instructions. 
  Maj. Gen. Jihad said that the instructions issued to members 
of the Fatah Movement inside the occupied territories are the 
same instructions issued before the signing of the Oslo 
agreement. He noted that these instructions stipulate that we 
continue our tasks, especially regarding our struggle against 
the Israeli occupation. He said: The intifadah activities and 
military operations inside the occupied territories are evidence 
that the Oslo accord did not change anything.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Feb 2 (AFP)--A financial crisis caused by 
suspension of Gulf aid is still rocking the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation despite official statements the problem is over, 
PLO sources in the Gulf said on Wednesday [2 February]. 
  The sources were reacting to comments by Muhammad Jihad, a 
central committee member of PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat's 
maintsream Fatah faction, that the organisation had overcome the 
crisis after receiving 29 million dollars in fresh aid from Arab 
and other countries. 
  "What Muhammad Jihad said is untrue," said an Abu 
Dhabi-based 
PLO official, who requested anonymity. "The crisis is 
continuing. We have not received our salaries for more than 
eight months." 
  Several employees at the PLO missions in the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE) and other oil-rich Gulf states, contacted by AFP, 
confirmed they had not received their salaries since mid-1993. 
  They said a circular sent by the PLO's foreign minister, 
Faruq Qaddumi, four months ago asking them to resign if they 
want was still in force. 
  The PLO has been facing increasing financial problems since 
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states halted aid to protest 
its sympathy with Iraq during its seven-month occupation of 
Kuwait nearly three years ago. 
  GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and 
the UAE -- were the main bankrollers of the PLO before the Iraqi 
invasion, providing it with more than two billion dollars in 
official aid. Billions of dollars have also been extended 
through private donations from Gulf shaykhs and businessmen and 
a five-percent tax on Palestinians living in the region. 
  Repeated attempts by the PLO to mend fences with the GCC 
were 
crowned with a reconciliation meeting between 'Arafat and King 
Fahd of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh last week. Kuwait, however, has 
said it will not deal with 'Arafat again. 
  The PLO's financial woes coincided with its peace accord 
with 
Israel, which could also be a boon in financial terms. The 
September 13 deal has already won he PLO pledges for two billion 
dollars in aid in the autonomous areas. 
  In an interview with Wednesday's UAE daily AL-KHALIJ, Jihad 
had said the PLO had received 15 million dollars from Greece, 
five million from Malaysia, three million from Indonesia, two 
million from Turkey, two million from Algeria and around two 
million from Saudi Arabia. 
  "The PLO has overcome its financial crisis," he said. "We 
have disbursed two-month salaries for all PLO staff."

  [Text] The Islamic Jihad in Palestine has undertaken to pay 
much of the money due to the families of the Palestinian martyrs 
and wounded fighters. The movement took over this duty some 
time after Yasir 'Arafat stopped paying the salaries, aid, and 
financial donations he used to give to the wounded Palestinians 
and families of the Palestinian resistance martyrs in Lebanon. 
  According to informed sources, the Jihad movement receives 
funding from Iran and gives it to these Palestinian families and 
wounded resistance fighters every month. The movement hands 
over this funding to some Palestinian officers inside the camps 
who have misgivings about 'Arafat's policies, despite their 
still being within the Fatah framework. 
  The same sources say that the necessary monthly funding to 
cover the expenses of the wounded and the families of the 
Palestinian martyrs in Lebanon amounts to $3 million a month. 
It is not known whether the Jihad movement covers this whole 
amount. Some sources point out that the movement pays, through 
some Fatah officers who have differences with 'Arafat, the 
monthly salaries of these families and the wounded men who fell, 
after 'Arafat cut salaries and aid to them. 
  The sources conclude by pointing to extensive Iranian 
activity in the camps in Lebanon, especially in the camps in 
south Lebanon. This activity centers on providing medical aid in 
particular.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador to United Nations 'Ali al-Hudayri </F>
by Ashraf al-Faqiyy in Surt; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Faqiyy] At the Arab League Council's 98th 
session the Arab states decided not to sign the Paris agreement 
banning chemical weapons. But the Arab position changed a great 
deal after most states signed the agreement. How can this be 
explained? 
  [Al-Hudayri] The Arab states were subjected to pressures 
from Western states, especially the United States, to force them 
to join the agreement banning chemical and biological weapons. 
The agreed Arab position was to sign the agreement provided 
so-called "Israel" joins the agreement banning nuclear weapons. 
Because it is unimaginable that the Arab states would sign the 
agreement on chemical weapons while an entity in the region has 
mass-destruction weapons. 
  [Al-Faqiyy] How do you explain the UN absence from the peace 
process in the Middle East, especially as the resolutions 
adopted by the Security Council are the basis of the peace 
process? 
  [Al-Hudayri] Regrettably, Arab weakness and the lack of a 
real vision enabling the Arabs to confront Western and Zionist 
pressures have enabled the Western side to achieve victories, 
especially in the so-called "Declaration of Principles 
agreement," which was intended to approve the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, which does not achieve peace. The problem has never 
been Gaza or Jericho. The problem lies basically in the Zionist 
occupation of the Arab territories, the settlements, and the 
annihilation campaign to which the Arab people in the occupied 
territories are exposed. As for so-called Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, it is no more than throwing dust in the eyes. 
  How can peace be established while all current talks are 
obstructed by major disagreements among the negotiators over the 
crossing points and controlling them, and while these talks also 
do not lead to a sovereign, independent Palestinian state? What 
is happening is a Western joke at the Arabs' expense. Some 
naive people have accepted these arrangements for other reasons 
which I cannot reveal. 
  What the Arab side accepted in the Gaza-Jericho agreement is 
much less than what had originally been on offer. And I am 
certain that if the Arab peoples realize the truth of the 
matter, they will have a correct view that will be able to 
change the course. All Arab states, including Libya, are for 
peace. But Libya believes that peace should be based on justice 
and the recovering of the Palestinian and Arab people's 
legitimate rights in the Golan, the West Bank, and Lebanon. 
  [Al-Faqiyy] Do you have reservations about the Arab states' 
positions on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 
on Libya since the Lockerbie crisis began? 
  [Al-Hudayri] The pretext mentioned by some Arab states is 
compliance with so-called international legitimacy, which has 
been misused in an illegitimate manner. Despite the harm 
inflicted on Arab interests and the Security Council 
resolution's failure to take account of internal law, the Arab 
states tend always to find the justification in that they do not 
want to violate international legitimacy. Libya is completely 
aware of the pressures to which the Arab states are exposed. 
They find themselves in a weak position, and so cannot resist 
or refuse to comply. The recent Security Council resolution, 
that is Resolution 883, is considered interference in the Arab 
states' internal affairs. Some Arab states have realized that, 
and attempts are being made to stop encroachment on Arab 
sovereignty. 
  [Al-Faqiyy] What is your opinion of French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe's saying that Libya is talking a lot but offering 
nothing tangible in reality regarding the Lockerbie crisis? 
  [Al-Hudayri] Libya has always expressed its intention of 
resolving the Lockerbie issue, especially as the Libyan people 
are the one harmed most as a result of the sanctions imposed 
since 15 April 1992. It is not in Libya's interests for these 
sanctions to continue. We are eager to solve this problem as 
soon as possible. We have offered numerous positive solutions 
which, had they been accepted by the United States, Britain, and 
France, would have helped to secure a solution. But lack of 
desire on the Western states' part prevented that. If they were 
serious, they would have accepted some of the proposals made by 
Libya, which are based on respect for international legitimacy 
and Libyan sovereignty, demand a fair trial for the suspects, 
and refuse to allow the Libyan people to stand trial for no 
crime they have committed. 
  [Al-Faqiyy] What new can Libya offer to find a solution? 
  [Al-Hudayri] Despite the clear injustice to which the Libyan 
people are exposed as a result of the embargo imposed on them, 
we will try with the three Western states to being an end to 
this case. We are convinced that they do not want a solution, 
as they have turned the Lockerbie case into a political issue. 
  [Al-Faqiyy] Do you believe that the Lockerbie case is 
intended to change the entire Libyan regime? 
  [Al-Hudayri] The Libyan regime cannot be destroyed, because 
it is not based on one or two figures who can be destroyed and 
that would be the end of it. To do that, the Libyan people have 
to be destroyed. It is the Libyan people alone who are entitled 
to retain or replace the regime. 
  [Al-Faqiyy] Is there any link between former Libyan Foreign 
Minister Mansur al-Kikhya's disappearance in Cairo and the 
Lockerbie case? 
  [Al-Hudayri] I have nothing to say in that connection.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Feb (MENA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH 
has affirmed that President Husni Mubarak's visit to Turkey 
falls within the framework of realizing the great pan-Arab and 
Egyptian goals and also within the framework of Mubarak's 
constant desire to establish deep and binding relations of 
cooperation and friendship with all countries of the world. 
  The newspaper said in an editorial in today's issue that 
Egypt has relations of friendship and cooperation with the 
countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and the Arab, Islamic, 
and European countries equally. 
  The newspaper adds: If we are aspiring to modern, civilized 
ties among the countries of the Mediterranean Sea basin that 
will restore to this region its significance and historical 
value to the whole world, it is only natural for Egypt to want 
to form a new kind of relations of cooperation with 
Turkey--relations that befit Egypt's position and history with 
Turkey since the latter is undeniably an Islamic country linked 
to Europe by special ties. 
  The newspaper stressed Egypt's efforts to establish peace in 
the Middle East. It also stressed Egypt's efforts to forge 
relations of cooperation and friendship with the countries 
bordering the Mediterranean Sea and normal and strong relations 
with the big powers in the northern half of the hemisphere. 
  The newspaper believes Egypt's present and future interests 
are the ultimate objective of the national leadership's every 
effort, regardless of the interconnected fronts and national 
working policies. Mubarak's visit to Turkey is a short one, but 
a visit that serves the long-term and grand objectives.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Police shot dead seven 
suspected Islamic militants in a gunbattle in a poor 
neighbourhood here overnight, the interior ministry said 
Wednesday. 
  It was one of the biggest single death tolls in the two-year 
war between fundamentalists and the security forces. 
  The militants opened fire as police moved in to arrest them 
late Tuesday at an apartment which had been under surveillance 
in the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' district, the ministry said. 
  Police fired back, killing seven of them, and discovered a 
large amount of arms, explosives and remote control devices in 
the apartment. None of the policemen was hurt. 
  The men were regarded as "amongst the most dangerous 
terrorists" and belonged to militant groups based in the 
southern province of Asyut, a fundamentalist hotbed, the 
ministry said. 
  Four of them, named as Yasir 'Abd-al-Hakim, Yasir Zaki, 
'Abd-al- Nabi Tayih and Tariq al-Qurashi, were suspected of 
setting up these gangs. 
  Interior Minister General Hasan al-Alfi told Wednesday's 
Al-Ahram newspaper that militants were "preparing attacks in 
different regions of the country." 
  Tuesday's operation had been "one of the most important 
confrontations with the terrorists," he said. 
  The latest clash raised the death toll in the battle between 
Islamic militants and the government to 291, including 105 
policemen and 95 fundamentalists.

under way with numerous countries to cooperate with us. Indeed, 
several fugitive terrorists have been arrested and others have 
been handed over. I hope you will not ask for the names of 
these countries and any figures right now, so that we will leave 
them in the dark. 
  [Tawfiq] But the minister told a news conference he would 
name these countries. 
  [Al-Alfi] Yes, but I said I would do that at the proper 
time. 
When I announce a specific location and say we brought in 
someone from there, his colleagues will go elsewhere or flee the 
country and thus we will have done them a service by warning 
them. 
  The same thing applies to terrorist operations. Sometimes we 
ask that news of such operations is not published and 
journalists start asking in whose interests is this secrecy. I 
tell them: Yes, there is an advantage, that of the 
investigation. 
  There are two examples: First, when we arrested the first 
suspect and banned the publication [of news] on the attempt to 
kill the prime minister. Then, we arrested nine suspects in 
subsequent measures. 
  The second example was the Hulwan movie theater incident. 
After news was published of two arrests, the others escaped 
after reading the newspapers. We had pinpointed their locations 
but found nothing except that day's newspapers. 
  [Tawfiq] Are the people required to live with terrorism for 
years to come? When will we eliminate this phenomenon that is 
alien to our society? 
  [Al-Alfi] I am not required to coexist with terrorism and it 
must be eliminated. 
  Egypt has always been a safe country, where people are 
extremely friendly and loving and religion is tolerant. Egypt 
is home to al- Azhar and Islam is a religion that follows a 
middle course; it knows no extremism and does not advocate 
violence. All these criminal incidents are the ideas of 
renegades with particular beliefs who live in some Islamic and 
Arab countries. But the Koran, the main source of our 
legislation, contains straightforward verses renouncing 
terrorism, violence, and killing. 
  The entire nation now knows that those who say some people 
are the infidel and sanction their killing and confiscation of 
their property are fakes. They are not Muslims. They even 
commit crimes against Islam and against the country. 
  It is not only Egypt that faces terrorism, because it is 
apparent that there is a plot to strike at every Arab and 
Islamic country in the name of Islam. Training in implementing 
this plot takes place abroad, where they assemble personnel of 
every nationality in one place. The methods of arming, 
training, and financing are the same. I saw pictures of 
incidents carried out by terrorists abroad and found them 
compatible with what happens in Egypt. The bombs have the same 
materials; they put nails and ball bearings in the bombs and use 
the same detonator. Weapons here and abroad are used in the 
same way and the training is the same. 
  Thus, the target is every Arab and Islamic country. Everyone 
has begun to realize this. We will eradicate terrorism because 
we are right and the people support us. The end of terrorism is 
certain. 
  If we had wanted to eliminate terrorism fast, we could have 
done so by resorting to extraordinary measures. But we are 
confronting terrorism with law and democracy, not resorting to 
extraordinary measures. 
  In addition to aborting the plots that were prepared during 
the new year, Christmas, and police day celebrations, we aborted 
other plots, arrested the plotters, and seized documents 
containing the names of some personalities. But I will not name 
names. All these are now cases, which will be referred to the 
court. The trials will be public. But secrecy will be 
maintained during the interrogation period. 
  [Tawfiq] Have antiterrorism steps been developed? 
  [Al-Alfi] Most important for us, the security men, is that 
we 
adopt a scientific course and sound planning and train on the 
highest level, in addition to acquiring weapons. The police 
department has been supplied with the most modern weapons. 
Police missions travel abroad. Technicians and experts arrive 
in Egypt to train us. The whole department has undergone such 
training. 
  I want to say something: Our action is no longer a 
tit-for-tat response. The initiative now is in the hands of the 
police. This has produced better results. We are searching for 
the terrorists' hideouts. We have arrested many terrorists and 
seized their equipment, explosives, and weapons. Thus, we have 
foiled several incidents before they took place. 
  If the terrorists are targeting policemen to get at the 
morale of the entire police department, I tell them: Every 
incident against a policeman, security man, or any citizen 
increases our determination to eliminate these terrorists. It 
also deepens our faith because we uphold justice and defend 
religion and the homeland. The initiative is in our hands and 
will remain so, despite the sacrifices. 
  [Tawfiq] You have referred 20 officers to the inspection 
department for investigation for mistreating citizens. You have 
confirmed that you are following up these investigations 
personally. Is this a standard policy? How can a complainant 
reach the minister personally? 
  [Al-Alfi] My office is open to everyone. There are 
instructions to the police commanders and the ministry's 
officials to open their offices to all citizens. No one is lax. 
We accept no insult against citizens. If there have been 
excesses, they are isolated incidents; they are not part of a 
policy toward citizens. 
  There is periodic, sudden, and continuous inspection of 
sections, centers, and services departments, such as the traffic 
department, the passport department, the work permits 
department, and the civil status department. 
  Soon there will be a public relations officer in every 
section, center, and department. The public relations officer 
will receive the citizen, look into his problem, and advise him 
what to do. There are also instructions that officers should be 
present in the service departments day and night. 
  You may remember a complaint by a tourism college graduate, 
which was published in the newspaper AKHBAR AL-HAWADITH. I said 
at the time that the complainant should come to my office 
immediately. We receive complaints but we also seek to identify 
the shortcomings. I ask people outside the police department to 
submit fictitious complaints without identifying themselves. 
For instance, they may say their home has been burgled or they 
have been attacked. They see how the duty officer reacts and 
the way he treats the complaint. Afterward, the complainant 
reveals his identity, investigates him, and decides on the 
punishment. There are many officers who behave positively. 
Some behave negatively. But more officers behave positively 
and are rewarded. Those who behave negatively are punished 
while those who behave positively are rewarded. 
  [Tawfiq] Terrorist incidents take place in broad daylight 
in crowded places in Upper Egypt's governorates. How do you 
explain the people's failure to resist the terrorists? Is this 
due to the negative attitude of the Upper Egypt resident to some 
customs and traditions that prevent him from intervening or to 
the police's bad treatment of citizens? 
  [Al-Alfi] One thing manifested in these crimes is the custom 
of taking revenge. This custom still exists. In some cities 
and villages in Upper Egypt, the people take their own revenge 
and do not surrender the criminal to the authorities. They do 
not even receive condolences for their own dead until they have 
taken revenge. Some families teach their children to take 
revenge as soon as they are old enough to use firearms. The 
mountains on both sides of the valley in Upper Egypt also make 
it easy for criminals and accused people to escape. 
  I can say the police do not get involved in ill treatment. 
But there is no doubt that like other police forces, there are 
violations. 
  [Tawfiq] Why, when owners of licensed weapons apply to renew 
their licenses, are weapons being withdrawn? This is happening 
more and more. And why have stringent measures been adopted 
when it comes to granting new licenses? 
  [Al-Alfi] It is not an issue of making things easier or more 
difficult. The firearms law is clear. There must be 
justifications and reasons, as stipulated by law, for granting a 
firearms license. What is happening is that some people are 
carrying weapons without any legal justification. But when 
there is a justification, the license is issued immediately. 
Many incidents happened in Upper Egypt in front of people 
carrying licensed weapons; they did not attempt to intervene. 
The issue here does not relate to licensed or unlicensed 
weapons, but to customs and traditions. 
  In the past few months we seized about 18,000 unlicensed 
weapons. We also discovered many weapons manufacturing shops and 
stores illegally trading in weapons. These stores' licenses 
have been canceled and their owners brought to trial. 
  [Tawfiq] Has the attempt to combat terrorism overshadowed 
the 
attempt to combat corruption, deviation, and narcotics? 
  [Al-Alfi] Our task is to implement the law and prevent 
crime. 
No one is above the law. Corruption, bribery, fraud, damage to 
public property, narcotics trafficking, and the exploitation of 
power must be checked. We investigate every report or every 
piece of information about such crime and the perpetrators are 
arrested and brought to trial. This is what is happening and 
has been happening recently. 
  [Tawfiq] Why were violations in Madinat al-Nasr only 
revealed 
10 years after they were committed? 
  [Al-Alfi] The government tackles corruption and implements 
the law. The government--the Interior Ministry and the state's 
administrative control departments--uncovered the violations in 
Madinat al-Nasr. We investigate any information we receive or 
any report submitted to us to uncover the truth. In the Madinat 
al-Nasr case, the government control departments uncovered the 
violations, on which no reports were submitted. The government 
control departments cannot turn a blind eye to violation. Our 
position is known. 
  Repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, whose story was 
published by AKHBAR AL-HAWADITH, deserves every honor. He is 
indeed a brave man and bold and I wish everyone was like him. 
He deserved every honor bestowed upon him. AKHBAR AL-YAWM 
editor Sabir Shawkat also did a courageous job. It was a bold, 
great step by AKHBAR AL- HAWADITH. 
  [Tawfiq] Do you have anything else to say? 
  [Al-Alfi] No. Thank you.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] In its 25 January issue, Cairo 'AQIDATI 
publishes on pages 1, 12, and 13 a 1,200-word report on a new 
experiment started by the Awqaf Ministry involving setting up 
"fatwa boxes" in the its mosques, where ordinary people can 
place any questions that require an Islamic legal ruling. 
  A 75-word report on the front page cites the mufti as 
denying 
a report published by a Gulf paper that included his name on a 
list of those who are defending British writer Salman Rushdie. 
Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi asked, "How could I defend a 
person who is mentally deranged and who had the nerve to mock 
Islam and its teachings and to ridicule God's prophet?" He then 
asserts that the Gulf paper's report was baseless, adding that 
he personally boycotts anyone who gets in touch with Rushdie. 
  The paper also carries a 200-word report on page 2 saying 
that the secretariat general of the Higher Committee of Islamic 
Propagation in al-Azhar and the Awqaf Ministry are preparing for 
a series of intellectual meetings and seminars to be held during 
the month of Ramadan. The report says that these meetings will 
discuss major issues such as drugs and how to combat them, Islam 
and the environment, social problems, Islam and the extent of 
the comprehensive development, and unemployment. The 
discussions will also include other major issues, such as "the 
issue of apostasy, its gravity and controls, and also Islam's 
call for security and stability, as well as the nation's unity 
in its capacity as the safety valve and the challenge." The 
report adds that "the regiments of propagation, leaders, and 
writers will visit the governorates throughout the month to 
discuss these issues, with the participation of the moderate 
Islamic societies and there will be a special emphasis on the 
villages to rid them of false ideas." 
  A 2,500-report is carried on pages 4 and 5 detailing the 
proceedings of a seminar organized by 'AQIDATI at the Arab 
Language College in al-Zaqaziq University. The seminar, which 
involved answers from various scholars and teachers to questions 
posed by the students, dealt with the causes of various 
interpretations of the Koran throughout history. Several 
scholars stressed that each person has the right to think, 
argue, and ask questions and should not just accept what earlier 
scholars and interpreters of Islam said without thinking. Dr. 
Su'ad Salih, dean of Islamic and Arab Studies at the al-Mansurah 
Branch of al-Azhar University, then explains the Koran's rules 
on women's dresses. 
  In reply to a question by one of the students about the 
causes of the phenomenon of terrorism and whether the Islamic 
groups are involved, Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Salih, dean of the Religion 
and Propagation College in al-Zaqaziq University, says: "There 
are several expressions that we have become used to hearing from 
the Western media, such as fundamentalist and Muslim terrorism. 
These are used by the Western media, which is financed by the 
Jews to make people frightened of Islam. This media does not 
differentiate between an observant Muslim and what it calls 
terrorists and extremists." He quotes Prophet Muhammad as 
urging his followers not to exaggerate or go to extremes in 
their religion. Giving the historic reasons for this 
phenomenon, he says: "The first reason is that religious 
teaching is neutralized and completely separate from civic 
teaching, which has no interest in teaching religion except on 
the margin and the marks given for this subject are not added to 
the total marks. The second reason is that there is a group of 
people who have taken it on themselves to attack religion and to 
call for moral decadence. Extremism in decadence leads to 
extremism in religion. Hence the state must tackle these two 
causes to eliminate the phenomenon of terrorism." The seminar 
then discusses the plight of Muslims in Bosnia and elsewhere and 
concludes that the Muslims themselves are to be blamed for this 
because they are divided and attack each other. Dr. Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Mun'im al-'Arabi, teacher of literature and criticism at 
the Arab Language College, says on this issue that: "The Islamic 
world must use economic boycott and political pressure in 
support of its causes. We have to preach and contribute our 
money to support our brothers dispersed in the world." 
  On pages 8 and 9, the paper carries questions from several 
readers asking for a religious ruling on various issues. 
Included in them is a question from Wajih al-Jamal from 
al-Qalyubiyah asking about the meaning of terrorism and Islam's 
concept of it. Shaykh Mahmud 'Abd-al-Wahhab Fayid replies that 
Islam calls for moderation in all matters in our life, citing 
several Koranic verses. He adds that Islam rejects terrorism, 
whether from the rulers or the ruled, because terrorism means 
the use of violence and frightening people. 
  A 350-word column written by Majdi Salim on page 10 
criticizes the Egyptian media's way of confronting the western 
immoral and debased programs that are transmitted through 
satellite. He says this media tries to outdo the Western one by 
transmitting still more decadent programs and liberalism that 
defies laws and controls. He argues that the only way to combat 
this cultural invasion is to strengthen religious beliefs at 
school, home, work, and through the media. 
  On the same page the paper carries a 700-word report on a 
seminar on "intellectual extremism" held at Cairo University. 
The report begins by citing Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi's 
explanation of the origin of the word extremism. He adds that 
Islam calls on its followers to be moderate in all their affairs 
and daily life. Muslim thinker Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu-al-Majd 
lashes out at those "who do not differentiate between piety and 
extremism and swear that there are no moderates. I tell them 
that the Egyptian people are moderate, perform the prayers, and 
fast during the month [of Ramadan]." He then adds that the 
crises facing us are the result of the custom among Egyptians, 
Arabs, and Muslims to regard "reading as an absolute evil to the 
extent that Arab and Muslim thinking was afflicted by a great 
imbalance in logical education and this is manifested by the 
absence of the literature of dialogue." After stressing the 
universality of Islam, he says that: "Islam's priorities today 
are to guide its people toward it and to strengthen it and not 
to call on people to follow it. The evil afflicting the Islamic 
groups from east to west is that they are preoccupied with Islam 
at the expense of Muslims and they believe that their mission is 
to train jurisprudents only." 
  Dr. Mufid Shihab, Cairo University President, differentiates 
between extremism, violence, and terrorism and explains each 
one. He says extremism is deviation that has not reached the 
extent of harming others, while violence means the use of force 
or the threat to use it against others, which is a violation of 
the law, while terrorism means the use of violence and force, 
contrary to the law, not with the aim of harming a certain 
person but to cause general destruction and ruin. He adds that: 
"?he terrorist is a criminal and has to be dealt with according 
to the law." He th?n conjectures that dialogue and not violence 
or punishment is the only way to deal with an extremist who does 
not harm others. He says that "extremism is a first step that 
might turn into terrorism. We must stop it before it turns into 
terrorism. Therefore, the treatment differs from case to case. 
There can be no dialogue with the terrorist or criminal but 
there has to be a dialogue with the extremists in an attempt to 
explain the truth." 
  Dr. 'Ali-al-Din Hilal, teacher at the College of Economics 
and Political Science, Cairo University, then argues that 
extremism exists in the mind and behavior and that there is 
extremism not only among Islamic groups but also among some 
Christian and Jewish groups and among various ethnic groups in 
other parts of the world. 
  'AQIDATI carries on page 16 an 800-word report on a question 
and answer session held by a "religious convoy" with the 
students of Alexandria and al-Mansurah Universities. The 
questions deal with the contradicting fatwas, population 
control, drug addiction, and other issues. Following a 
teacher's reply to a question on drug addiction, Dr. Muhammad 
Hasan al-Hafnawi, teacher at al-Azhar's School of Medicine, 
answers a question by Suhayr Muhammad al-Bardisi on the reasons 
for the spread of terrorism in this way that harms Islam. He 
says that: "Ignorance is the main reason. The extremist has 
filled his brain with wrong information and followed it and thus 
has turned into an extremist. He would not have become so had 
he understood his religion well. The first step to reform him 
is science, then conviction, and then guidance of the right 
will. True religious knowledge is the safety valve against 
deviation. All the forces must rally for this decisive 
confrontation. Who will defend Egypt if its sons lose faith in 
it?" 
  The Awqaf minister then answers a question on why the state 
has canceled some religious television programs. He explains 
that each program has its own temporary objective and is meant 
to tackle a specific point. Management then replaces it with 
new programs that raise new issues for debate. 
  On page 20, the paper carries a 900-word report on an 
interview with Moroccan Muslim thinker Muhammad al-Wazzani in 
which he discusses the plight of Bosnia's Muslims, the situation 
in Somalia, and the spread of Islam in Africa. He also asserts 
that the "terrorist actions" in Algeria and Egypt "have nothing 
to do with Islam and are alien to our Muslim societies."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by MBC </F>
correspondent 'Aziz Fahmi in Washington; date not 
given--recorded; Peres' remarks in English translated into 
Arabic by interviewer] 
  [Text] [Peres] I believe that we have overcome some 
important problems but we still face some dealing with substance 
and wording. We will exert exceptional efforts to complete the 
talks, but I do not wish to set dates because negotiations may 
take a day, a week, or even a month longer than a fixed date. 
This is not because of a lack of goodwill or pessimism, but 
experience has taught us that some issues that we imagine to be 
unimportant may emerge suddenly and cause a problem that will 
need long hours of negotiations to resolve. 
  [Fahmi] Why does Israel insist on the need for the presence 
of Israeli security officers at the crossings to search 
travelers? 
  [Peres] There are two basic reasons. Although I believe that 
'Arafat has issued orders to PLO members to halt acts of 
violence and terrorism, there are other organizations that are 
still carrying out such acts. Israel has to engage in 
negotiations simultaneously as it faces violence and terrorism. 
  We told 'Arafat that as long as this situation persists we 
will be strict on security issues because when a traveler 
crosses to Gaza and Jericho, he enters not only these two cities 
but also Israel and he has the freedom to travel in it. 
Therefore, we are strict in negotiations concerning security 
issues. 
  We suggested to 'Arafat that the security arrangements be on 
a temporary basis and that if acts of violence stop, the 
arrangements we have agreed upon may be revised. 
  [Fahmi] The Syrians still insist on your acceptance of a 
complete withdrawal before they define the meaning of a complete 
peace. Are we still in the same situation after the Geneva 
summit? 
  [Peres] This does not make sense but the Syrians know our 
stance on the withdrawal. They must say what they mean by a 
complete peace. They must prove their willingness to accept 
security arrangements that fulfill the Israeli and Syrian 
security requirements. 
  [Fahmi] Are there secret channels for negotiations between 
Syria and Israel and what are the means to achieve progress in 
these negotiations? 
  [Peres] There are no channels for negotiations with Syria 
except the Washington negotiations. However, we need to conduct 
negotiations on a higher level of representation because new 
proposals can be put forth. The continuation of negotiations 
only at the official level means that the negotiators will keep 
repeating their familiar stances.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Senior defense sources, headed by Chief of Staff 
Ehud Baraq, told Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense 
minister, that although they have "minor and marginal" 
observations about the document of understandings worked out 
Sunday [30 January] in Davos, they will support the document if 
PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat signs it, senior political sources in 
Jerusalem said yesterday. 
  The sources said that "if 'Arafat would have signed the 
document first, Rabin would have accepted it." The sources said 
that during the Davos meeting, there was ongoing telephone and 
facsimile contacts between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and 
the prime minister, as well as between Major General 'Uzi Dayan, 
a member of the Israeli delegation, and the military top brass. 
  Ongoing consultations were also held between Rabin, Baraq, 
Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, head of intelligence Uri 
Sagi, and the Shin Bet chief. They transmitted their comments 
to Davos by facsimile. "The Army top brass had many 
observations about the initial drafts presented to the 
Palestinian delegation," the political sources said, "but they 
support the final document. They said that they have comments 
on several minor and noncritical points, but in principle they 
feel that the PLO accepted the Israeli position." 
  In deliberations held prior to the foreign minister's 
departure for Davos, in which the prime minister and the defense 
team participated, the Army brass firmly opposed for security 
reasons some of the proposals raised by Peres. They demanded 
that Israel keep full control of the roads to the Gaza Strip 
settlements and that it be made clear that the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] will continue to move along the traffic axes 
termed "safe corridors" between Jericho and the Allenby Bridge, 
al-Nabi Musa, and the Dead Sea. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Police Minister Moshe Shahal this morning opened 
a Civil Guard station at Ma'ale Adumim, the first in the 
territories. Speaking at the opening ceremony, he promised that 
the Civil Guard units will be limited to patrolling within the 
settlement itself. The police minister also said that five other 
Civil Guard stations will be opened shortly in the territories. 
Reporter Mark Weiss asked Minister Shahal about the 
significance of the opening: 
  [Begin recording] [Shahal] A decision has been taken about 
a year ago, and the previous government decided to implement the 
idea of having this guard, like in any other parts in Israel. I 
think that the significance is that we are looking upon Ma'ale 
Adumim as any other town, and we rely on the citizens of this 
town to be responsible for their security, to help the police 
force. I think this is the political significance of the 
decision. 
  [Weiss] Do you believe this new Civil Guard will be able to 
cooperate with the Palestinian police force to be set up under 
autonomy? 
  [Shahal] Well, I think that there will be a need of 
cooperation. If the Palestinian police force cares for the 
security, to deal with and to prevent crime, I think that it 
will be necessary to cooperate on all levels, and we hope that 
this is going to happen. Any professional police force need 
this kind of cooperation. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho will receive $170 million annually from taxes collected 
by Israeli Government bodies. Ya'ir Fidel, our economic 
correspondent in Tel Aviv, was apprised of this fact by a 
business source connected to the political process. This sum 
will furnish one-third of the Palestinian authority's budget. 
The source of the money will be port taxes, fuel surcharges, 
other taxes, and national insurance dues, which will be 
collected for the Palestinians by Israel.

<F P=106> [Report by Lili Galili] </F>
  [Text] Addressing a delegation of 57 French 
parliamentarians, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin sharply 
criticized the policy of the European countries toward Iran and 
Iraq and their refusal to support Israel's efforts to get 
accepted as a member of the UN's "West European and Others" bloc 
at a time when a peace process is under way. 
  Beilin explained that such membership would enable Israel to 
run for selected UN positions and would give all Israelis the 
feeling that a new era is dawning as a result of a process which 
naturally arouses fear in them. The deputy minister emphasized 
that France "played a leading role in formulating the negative 
response to Israel's request." The meeting with the 
parliamentarians, who represent France's three major parties, 
was attended by French Ambassador Jean Louis Lucet. On their 
second day in Israel, the French visitors met with President 
'Ezer Weizman and toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. 
  In a meeting at the Holiday Inn in Jerusalem, Beilin argued 
that the Europeans are actually not prepared to take part in the 
peace process and that when he approached the European foreign 
ministers in the late 1980's, they referred him to the United 
States. According to him, these countries still do not show any 
willingness to become involved today. Contrary to the United 
States, Norway, or Japan, "the Europeans are not prepared to do 
much today either, other than travel to Syria and Lebanon and 
relay messages." 
  Referring to the policy toward Iran and Iraq, Beilin 
justified the U.S. approach of ostracizing and isolating these 
countries. On the other hand, he criticized the approach of the 
European countries, which wrongly justify their "embrace" of 
Iran by arguing that "sometimes it is better to embrace somebody 
than to push him into a corner." According to Beilin, "an 
assertive policy" toward Iran on the part of the European 
countries could make a real contribution to peace as far as 
Israel and its neighboring Arab states are concerned. 
  The French parliamentarians were slightly embarrassed when 
Beilin summed up this part of the meeting by saying that he 
finds it hard to understand French foreign policy, which 
expresses friendship and fraternity on one hand, but 
demonstrates very little genuine response on the other. 
  Replying to a question on the issue, Beilin said he has no 
doubt whatsoever regarding the positive conclusion of the 
Gaza-Jericho First phase of the agreement. He added that a 
permanent comprehensive peace arrangement with Jordan, Syria, 
and Lebanon could materialize in 1994. Some of the 
parliamentarians told HA'ARETZ that at this early stage of their 
visit, "they have already learned to appreciate Israeli 
democracy, where a peace process is taking place amid tough 
internal criticism from many sectors of the population."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Time Bomb in Asia"] </F>
  [Text] President Clinton's greatest success to date has 
been to avoid getting involved in foreign crises. He did not 
give in to the pressure of those who advocate an active, global 
U.S. leadership in the belief that in the absence of clear-cut 
evidence of its determination, the Washington administration 
will be ridiculed by both friend and foe. As an opponent of the 
Vietnam War and one who moved into the center of the political 
arena in the quarter century since then but is still afraid of 
the unforeseeable cost of involvement, Clinton is willing to 
take the criticism and pay the price of doing nothing, on the 
assumption that the price of doing something is much higher. 
  This has been his attitude so far in the case of Bosnia and 
of Haiti, but his ability to tread the same path with North 
Korea is gradually decreasing. Clinton's behavior vis-a-vis the 
radical, conservative regime in Pyongyang last year resembled 
the way the governor of Arkansas would treat Republican 
legislators in Little Rock: pompous declarations and threats 
wrapped in incentives, culminating in a compromise depicted as a 
success. This system has barely worked with Congress in 
Washington, where Clinton carried fateful votes with a minuscule 
albeit decisive majority, but it is not effective when the 
adversary is a foreign leader who has been ruling his country 
since toddler Bill Blythe -- he changed his name to "Clinton" 
years later, in honor of his stepfather -- was in kindergarten. 
  Kim Il-song has long strived to attain the nuclear 
capability 
that would enable him to threaten South Korea, punch a hole in 
the U.S. nuclear umbrella protecting it, and promote his goal of 
military or political reunification of both parts of the Korean 
peninsula. Thousands of U.S. troops stationed south of the 34th 
parallel would presumably become hostages in the event of an 
invasion from the north. Although Washington could respond with 
a nuclear strike on the north if the south were facing defeat, 
the north's nuclear weapons directly aimed at thousands of 
Americans and millions of Seoul residents might force the 
leaders of the south to make concessions without engaging in 
combat. 
  Clinton had hoped to force North Korea to stop striving to 
attain nuclear capability by subjecting its facilities to 
international supervision, but he failed. After precious months 
of evasions by North Korea and the U.S. agreement to put off 
joint maneuvers with the South Korean Army, North Korea 
consented to partial -- hence useless -- supervision. Clinton 
hesitated for a month before he approved the stationing of 
Patriot missile batteries in South Korea to protect it from 
North Korea's surface-to-surface missiles which, as far as is 
known, are not outfitted with nuclear warheads but might be 
equipped with chemical ones. In his capacity as troubleshooter, 
Clinton's concern about causing an escalation through his 
response made some sense. This logic, however, is two-sided 
logic (Washington versus Pyongyang), whereas Clinton's problem 
is much broader: regional (how will the PRC and Japan proceed) 
and global (how will the message of U.S. feebleness be 
interpreted). 
  Hesitancy will not help Clinton. He will ultimately be 
compelled to use force or lose what is left of his credibility 
in Tokyo, Beijing, and other capitals at a time when his global 
nuclear arms control initiative is supposed to be the crowning 
glory of his foreign and defense policy efforts in 1994 and 
1995. The clock in the nuclear time bomb is ticking. If it 
goes off, it will mean that Clinton was tragically late.

  [Text] In Baghdad, Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, secretary general of 
the Arab Popular Forces Conference, has accused U.S. President 
Clinton of seeking to extend the anti-Iraq embargo and 
criticized his conditions for reducing international sanctions. 
Hammudi, who is also a member of the Iraqi Ba'th Party's 
Foreign Relations Committee, described Clinton's message as one 
of blackmail. 
  This is the first Iraqi official reaction to Clinton's 
message to Congress in which he expressed his fears that the 
Iraqi authorities might rebuild Iraq's mass destruction arsenal. 
Clinton demanded a long period of monitoring on Iraq's military 
establishments before any reduction of the sanctions is effected.

  [Text] Baghdad, 2 Feb (INA)--The newspaper BABIL says that 
Clinton's efforts to perpetuate the unfair embargo imposed on 
Iraq, advancing hollow arguments and flimsy pretexts that are 
not supported by any legal grounds, reflect his own bankruptcy, 
as well as his violation of the international community's will 
and laws. 
  In an article published today, the paper adds: Iraq has 
implemented Section C of Resolution 687, as well as Resolution 
715 on future monitoring. This requires the immediate lifting 
of the oil embargo, as well as an all-out lifting of the 
sanctions. 
  The paper goes on to say: There are no provisions in the 
relevant UN Security Council resolutions that speak of a 
"probation period." As for waffler Clinton's talk about 
democracy and human rights, this is foolish talk. 
  BABIL says: At a time when well-intentioned parties all over 
the world have continued to make statements on the need to lift 
the embargo, and when the positions of most permanent members of 
the UN Security Council on the embargo have undergone positive 
changes, Clinton, in his report to the Congress, reveals himself 
as a heretic. 
  The paper adds: Clinton professes to be a staunch defender 
of civilized conduct at a time when he continues to slay elderly 
people, children, and women in Somalia. It was Clinton who 
ordered the missile attack on innocent civilians in Baghdad, 
causing the death of men and children on the night of 26-27 June 
1993, when there were no hostilities between Iraq and the United 
States. 
  The paper concludes by saying: Iraq's steadfastness, the 
determination of leader President Saddam Husayn, and the 
enhancement of the march of construction and jihad will remain 
the means to end the embargo, whether Clinton likes it or not.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 1, INA--THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER said today 
that the UN Special Commission expert Charles Duelfer, American, 
recently concluded a short visit to Iraq after holding 
discussions with the Iraqi officials on the long-term monitoring 
of Iraq's weapons. Duelfer also discussed with the Iraqis the 
visit of UN Sanctions Commission UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus to Iraq 
which is expected to start on February 2. 
  A paper editorial added, however, the main job of Duelfer in 
Baghdad was to discuss with Iraqi counterparts a plan set by 
UNSCOM to implement the monitoring system of Iraq's weapons. 
  Duelfer told reporters in Baghdad shortly before his 
departure that his talks with the Iraqi side were significant 
and many points were clarified. 
  The editorial further said, Duelfer wanted to tell reporters 
that "there is still more to be done", he had made it clear that 
the monitoring system needs more time, even more than six 
months, the period set by Ekeus six months ago. 
  But this "more to be done" is not by Iraq, but the UNSCOM. 
Iraq has accepted UN Security Council Resolution 715 which is 
based on the monitoring svstem. The time is, therefore, needed 
by the UN body to implement the technicalities of its resolution 
and Iraq has expressed its readiness to provide help and this 
was stressed by Duelfer. 
  The editorial said before the arrival of Duelfer, Rolf Ekeus 
said in a press interview that monitoring would take a year to 
prove its efficiency. Ekeus, however, had said before that such 
a system needs six months to be fixed. Now, he extends that to 
one year which means the Security Council would need another 
year to think of lifting the trade sanctions on Iraq or not. 
  However, the Security Council resolutions state that if Iraq 
agrees to the monitoring system, the Security Council should 
lift the trade sanctions even partially. 
  It is quiet clear from the statements made by the various UN 
officials that the U.S. Administration is dictating the Security 
Council what to do in order to prolong the trade sanctions. 
This is quiet clear through the recent every two-month 
UN-official discussions held by the Security Council members on 
the trade sanctions on Iraq. The U.S. and British 
representatives' stands were rather firm to prolong the 
sanctions while those of France, Russia and China are rather in 
favour of lifting them. 
  Any observer would see clearly how the U.S. is directly 
influencing the UN and its organisations. When the six-month 
period which was earlier given to Iraq to assess its position 
towards the implementation of resolution 715 becomes nearer, the 
U.S. extends the period to one year and Ekeus and his aides have 
got the message and they started talking about the year time and 
there is more to be done and so on. 
  We hope that this time Ekeus would come to Iraq carrying 
UNSCOM's and not U.S. demands because this would only complicate 
the situation, the editorial concluded.

  [Text] An explosive charge went off outside the Defense 
Ministry building in Baghdad last week. The explosion of the 
device that was hidden in a garbage container wounded two guards 
and caused material damage. 
  Reporting this, our sources said that a meeting of senior 
military officials of tyrant Saddam's regime was scheduled for 
that day, but the explosion caused chaos and forced the 
officials to postpone the meeting. No party has claimed 
responsibility but reports indicate that the explosion is part 
of some settling of accounts among Ba'thist regime members.

  [Text] Political efforts have been increased to end the 
current conflict in Afghanistan. Our colleague reports from 
Kabul: 
  [Unidentified reporter] Simultaneous with the arrival in 
Kabul of large groups of the neutral jihad commanders and 
mediators, the head of Jalalabad Jihad Council announced that a 
nationwide peace session will be held in this city soon. He 
said: In order to convene such a session, coordination has taken 
place among all the jihad factions and commanders and the 
neutral political forces, including Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami 
[Islamic Unity Party]. They have agreed that a prompt and 
nationwide measure should be undertaken to resolve the current 
crisis in Afghanistan. 
  Head of another peace group, named the Reform Council 
[Shura-ye Eslahi], announced in Kabul that President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar have agreed with 
his mediation to end the current conflict. 
  A source affiliated to Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami reiterated his 
party's neutral stance in the current conflict today, and 
stressed the need for the intensification of peace efforts to 
end the war. He described the current war as a conflict which 
will achieve nothing but the further weakening and reduced 
credibility of Afghanistan's revolutionary and jihad groups. 
  These peace efforts are being undertaken at a time when the 
two main warring sides have reported fresh fighting in the 
northern region of Afghanistan. Opponents of the government say 
that thousands of troops loyal to the president have been 
surrounded in the Nahrain region, northeast of Baghlan Province. 
On the other hand a source close to the government has said 
that president's forces have achieved remarkable victory in the 
ongoing battles of Baghlan, Jowzjan, and Fariab Provinces. 
  On the military status of the warring factions, an Afghan 
mojahedin commander said: In recent days the Hezb-e Eslami 
[Islamic Party] and General Dostam's forces have concentrated 
their efforts on inflicting blows on the government's vulnerable 
military centers in the northern region of Afghanistan.

  [Text] In Sheberghan and Mazar-e Sharif, the criminal 
militia's last command bases were crushed last night and today 
by the air force of the Islamic army of the country. According 
to a report by the military correspondent of Bakhtar Information 
Agency, Sheberghan's airport and command and concetration 
centers of the communist traitors were bombed by jets of the 
heroic air force of the country. As a result of the air raids, 
heavy losses have been inflicted on the criminal militia. 
  According to another report, air raids were conducted on the 
enemy's centers in Balkh Province. The report adds: Dehdadi 
airport, Qala-e Jangi, and other areas of concentration of the 
atheists and traitors were hit by the air force of the Islamic 
army of the country. As a result of the destruction of the 
fighter planes that were at the disposal of the looter militia 
and their hypocrite colleagues, the country's air space is now 
completely under the control of the air force of the Islamic 
army. It is for this reason that the last command and 
concentration centers of the enemy are being bombarded by the 
air force and are being eliminated one by one. 
  Similarly, another report says: last night, the militia, 
which has sold itself, made another failed military effort in 
the area of Pacha Pol and mounted a broad offensive against the 
positions of the Islamic army and mojahedin. Consequently, they 
confronted the resistance of islamic forces, and, having 
suffered heavy losses, they were forced to retreat. 
  By the same token, the notorious militia of Golboddin-Dostom 
yesterday mounted an offensive against the positions of the 
islamic army in the area of Bagh-e Babor, where as a result of 
the counter offensive of the Islamic army, 43 of their people 
were killed and 50 others were injured, and they eventually were 
forced to retreat. A number of foreign mercenaries are among 
the dead. The enemy's one tank was set abalze, and their two 
posts behind Gozargah electricity station were captured by the 
brave defenders of islam.

  [Text] Islamabad, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Troops loyal to Afghan 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani killed 43 rebel troops and wounded 
another 300 in clashes in Kabul Tuesday, the state-run Radio 
Kabul said in a broadcast monitored here. 
  The militia of Hezb-i-Islami leader Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar suffered 43 dead and 50 injured after attacking state 
forces and being repulsed, the radio said. 
  In another engagement with the Uzbek militia of General 
Abdul 
Rashid Dostam, allied with Hekmatyar, the pro-Rabbani forces 
wounded 300 rebels in the Microrayan area of Kabul, the 
broadcast said. 
  The radio said the Dostam militia has lost 1,000 men during 
the month-long fighting, which erupted when the Uzbek warlord 
launched an offensive on January 1, in cooperation with the 
Hezb, to oust Rabbani from power. 
  Meanwhile, Afghan sources in the Pakistani border city of 
Peshawar said a 100-member mission comprising mojhedin 
commanders, religious scholars and elders had launched a new 
initiative to end the bloodshed. 
  The mediation team, led by commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, 
left 
the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad Tuesday for Kabul for talks 
with the warring sides. 
  Last month, more than 40 commanders from the Kabul area made 
two attempts to bring about a ceasefire, but failed to bring 
Rabbani and Hekmatyar to the negotiating table.

  [Text] Kabul, 1 Feb (MENA)--Nine Arab youths were killed 
during the fighting that raged yesterday southwest of the Afghan 
capital Kabul, during which forces loyal to Afghan President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani seized one of the positions controlled by 
Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar in the (?Jowzjan) area. 
  Mohammad Yunus Kanuni, the political counselor at the Afghan 
Defense Ministry, told MENA that these youths' identities have 
not been ascertained yet but interrogation of other prisoners 
showed that they were Egyptian, Sudanese, and Algerian nationals. 
  He regretted the fact that the names of those killed are not 
known so as to inform their families. He said that Hekmatyar's 
forces took away their passports as soon as they joined and gave 
them aliases that do not indicate their real identities. 
  In reply to a question on how these youths had come to the 
areas of fighting in Afghanistan, Yunus said that a number of 
service offices that operate under false Islamic names succeeded 
in enticing these youths to come to Afghanistan under the false 
pretext of "Islamic jihad." 
  The Afghan official expressed hope that Muslim youths will 
understand what the real situation in Afghanistan is before they 
think of traveling to it under false slogans that take jihad as 
their symbol. He added that the service offices treat these 
groups as mercenaries.

  [Text] In a story totally different from the official story 
announced earlier by Damascus about the death of Basil al-Asad, 
eldest son of Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, highly reliable 
sources have emphasized that Basil was the target of an armed 
attack on Wednesday, 19 January 1994, during a visit to Beirut. 
  Following the attack, Basil was moved to a Syrian Hospital 
in 
a complete coma. He died on Friday morning after a two-day coma. 
  The sources emphasized that the killers succeeded in 
escaping. A joint committee of the Syrian and Lebanese 
intelligence services is investigating the incident. 
  The preliminary conclusions of the committee indicate that 
foreign quarters are behind the sinful assassination.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Editorializing on the bilateral talks in 
Washington, TISHRIN says: The Washington talks, being 
conducted at the level of delegation heads, begin their second 
week today amid some positive indications. The paper notes, 
however, that decisive results are still a long way off because 
the Israeli negotiators have not announced Israel's willingness 
to withdraw fully from the occupied Arab territories. 
Withdrawal, the paper asserts, is the key to a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  TISHRIN goes on: Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday acknowledged the 
importance of peace with Syria. Rabin had been denying this 
fact since the Oslo agreement. 
  The paper adds: Developments have proven that there can be 
no peace in the region without Syria. Syria has over the past 
two years made tremendous efforts to advance the peace process. 
It presented a working paper during the sixth round, which to 
date is the only formal paper for the Washington talks. Syria 
has repeatedly rescued the U.S. peace initiative from Israel's 
ploys. The Geneva summit was the apex of Syria's serious 
endeavor to establish a just, comprehensive, and durable peace 
in the Middle East. 
  TISHRIN underlines U.S. President Clinton's praise for 
Syria's relentless efforts and his adoption of President 
al-Asad's call for the peace of the brave in the region. Syria 
did all of this out of its love for, and belief in, peace, and 
not to convince Israel of its true desire for peace. Israel is 
the party that should do this. 
  Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN asserts the need for 
Israel's withdrawal from all of the occupied Arab territories, 
since this would give the peace process great momentum and 
expedite the achievement of tangible, decisive progress on the 
path to the just aspired-for peace. Syria is only demanding its 
territory and what is its right. Its position is completely in 
line with UN resolutions, the Madrid conference foundations, and 
the principles of international law. Israeli occupation, on the 
other hand, violates resolutions and principles. The aggressor 
should certainly prove its goodwill. 
  Under the headline "The Touchstone," AL-THAWRAH says: 
Despite the optimistic atmosphere that prevailed the world 
following the Geneva summit and one week after the Washington 
talks at the level of the heads of delegations, Israel alone has 
continued to adhere to its methods that obstruct any concrete 
progress. Israel alone is the source of pessimism about 
prospects for making concrete progress, by avoiding giving any 
clear and definite answers to the question of full withdrawal 
from the Golan and the occupied Arab territories, which is the 
basis of a just and comprehensive peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH affirms that maneuvering has continued to be the 
distinguishing feature of Israel's policy. This is despite the 
fact that the Geneva summit has convinced the whole world, 
primarily the United States, of the true Arab desire for a just 
and comprehensive peace, and despite everything that Syria has 
done throughout the peace process, including the important 
Geneva summit, to prove its goodwill and tireless efforts to 
achieve a just and comprehensive peace that restores to the 
Arabs their land and rights and preserves their dignity. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: No doubt, Israel was the biggest -- not to 
say the only -- loser after the Geneva summit. Israel did not 
want the Geneva summit to convene in the first place. It wanted 
the Zionist voice to be the only voice in the ears of the U.S. 
Administration. 
  The paper goes on: The Geneva summit has accentuated the 
need for a just and comprehensive solution in accordance with 
the resolutions of international legitimacy. It has also 
bolstered Syria's key role in the region, especially in the 
peace process on all of its tracks. 
  The paper concludes: Amid this climate, the Washington talks 
are continuing. These talks put the Tel Aviv rulers to the 
test, as to whether or not they are going to respond to the will 
of the international community and that of Washington in 
implementing Security Council resolutions and acknowledging the 
requirements for a just and comprehensive solution. Based on 
this touchstone, the international community will be responsible 
for implementing its legitimacy and putting an end to Israel's 
rebellion. 
  Under the headline "The Margin for Israeli Maneuvering," 
AL-THAWRAH writes in another commentary: The results of the 
historic Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton 
have placed Israel in a tight spot and face to face with the 
challenge of peace. Israel has only one option: Either to 
accept a just, comprehensive peace and respond to its 
requirements and conditions -- enshrined in the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and stipulating withdrawal from all of 
the occupied Arab territories and acknowledging the inalienable 
rights of the Palestinian people -- or to reject this peace and 
bear the consequences for passing up this historic opportunity. 
  AL-THAWRAH asserts that the world is now convinced that 
Israel is the party that is creating obstacles to hinder and 
blow up the peace process and deny this hot, unstable region any 
peace and stability. This is because Israel's creed and strategy 
and the reasons for its existence contradict this situation. 
  The paper concludes: All indications, and the conduct of the 
Tel Aviv rulers, point to one fact: The Israeli rulers are not 
in the business of making peace. They are absolutely not 
interested in making the peace process succeed. Quite the 
opposite is true.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] AL-THAWRAH comments that the Geneva summit showed 
that the Arabs are determined to pursue a just and comprehensive 
peace grounded in UN resolutions and the land-for-peace formula, 
which figured in Clinton's post-summit statement in which he 
told President Hafiz al-Asad that the United States is committed 
to a lasting and comprehensive peace. Success or failure of the 
ongoing bilateral talks in Washington will depend on whether 
Israel will go along with a comprehensive and just settlement. 
  The ball is now in the Israeli court and the world is 
looking 
to see how far Israeli officials are able to comprehend 
international developments after the Geneva summit. By 
reverting to shiftiness and the tactic of separate deals, Israel 
is thus passing up a valuable chance to achieve a settlement 
which it needs even more than the Arabs. A world so impressed 
by the outcome of the summit of the age and the personality of 
President Hafiz al-Asad continues to hope that the summit will 
still be able to push the peace process forward and then achieve 
the peace of the brave. The world will not tolerate another 
Israeli attempt to bypass the summit. Meanwhile, the U.S. 
Administration, which is firmly convinced Syria is seeking true 
peace, wants Israel to comprehend the new facts of the new stage 
and to help Washington make a go of the American initiative of 
the land-for-peace formula. Syria's idea of the land-for-peace 
formula is for Israel to effect an unconditional withdrawal from 
the occupied Golan Heights and southern Lebnaon, which is being 
demanded of the Israeli negotiators in Washington. The Israeli 
negotiators are not coming up with any better ideas than the 
ones they put forward in previous sessions. Their arrival in 
Washington was preceded by the bizarre and unwarranted call for 
a referendum to decide whether to withdraw from the Golan -- a 
call that runs counter to an international and American support 
for the right of the region's peoples to a just, comprehensive, 
and durable peace, the peace of the brave. 
  In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH writes under the headline 
"The New Opportunity:" The current round of the Washington 
talks is an opportunity to relaunch and break the deadlock in 
the peace process. Whatever the expectations held out for the 
Washington talks, it is important that they prove more 
productive than earlier rounds. In which case the optimism that 
the talks will yield results will have been justified. For this 
to happen, the Israeli negotiators need to adopt new postures 
and speak a new language, and stay away from equivocation and 
trickery. The paper notes that the Geneva summit gave the peace 
process a chance to succeed. But there is the risk of this 
chance being lost unless Israel shows seriousness and commits 
itself publicly and unequivocally to the parameters of a just 
peace as outlined by the Madrid formula and reiterated at the 
Geneva summit. Just how serious Israel is will be judged by 
whether it will state a clear intention to pull out from all the 
occupied territory and admit that a comprehensive settlement on 
all fronts without detriment to Arab rights is the only road to 
peace.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Police fired tear gas and 
used water cannon here Tuesday to scatter thousands of Sikhs 
protesting against U.S. President Bill Clinton's remarks on the 
rights of Sikhs in the Indian state of Punjab. 
  Steel-helmeted policemen lobbed 12 teargas shells in quick 
succession after the estimated 10,000 demonstrators threw stones 
and almost broke through a security cordon in a bid to march on 
the U.S. embassy. 
  The Sikhs, chanting slogans and waving placards denouncing 
Clinton, immediately scattered. A police officer was injured 
after being hit by a stone. 
  The demonstration was organised by the Punjab chapter of 
India's ruling Congress (I) party and the protestors arrived in 
the capital in buses from the northern state, where a Sikh 
separatist campaign is on its last legs. 
  It was the third and the biggest demonstration here since 
Clinton wrote a letter on December 27 to U.S. Representative 
Gary Condit saying he wanted a "peaceful solution that protected 
Sikh rights" in Punjab. 
  The letter was in reply to a letter seeking U.S. 
intervention 
"to end the misery in Khalistan... where over 110,000 Sikhs have 
been killed by Indian security forces since 1984 and 70,000 
Sikhs are languishing in jails without being tried." 
  Khalistan, or Land of the Pure, is the name given to Punjab, 
India's only Sikh-majority state, by Sikh militants campaigning 
for an independent homeland. 
  "There is a lot of anger in Punjab over Clinton's remarks," 
said Ram Lubaya Chowdhary, a leader of the Punjab Congress 
chapter. "Sikh rights are perfectly safe in Punjab," added 
Gurumukh Singh, a Sikh farmer. 
  Thousands have died in Punjab since 1983 in the separatist 
campaign. Indian security forces in the state have been accused 
of torture and killing suspected militants in cold blood.

<F P=106> [By Soumya K. Ghosh] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 23 -- After a gap of a few years, 
Delhi is again becoming the hub of India's flourishing narcotics 
industry. It is also back on the world map as a major 
originating centre for heroin export. 
  Estimates suggest that of the 40 tonnes of heroin produced 
in 
this country annually, as much as 25 tonnes of this illicitly 
produced commodity passes through the Capital. 
  Anti-drug agencies say that nearly 50 kg of heroin, which is 
55 to 60 per cent pure, enters Delhi every day from the 
neighbouring States of Rajasthan, UP [Uttar Pradesh], and Madhya 
Pradesh. 
  It is clear that their tall claims notwithstanding, 
organisations like the NCB [Narcotics Control Board], DRI 
[Directorate of Revenue Intelligence], Customs and Directorate 
of Enforcement have been quite ineffective in restricting the 
trafficking in drugs. 
  Adding to the problem is a corrupt and inefficient police 
system. Together, these factors have combined to make the scale 
of drug trafficking in Delhi comparable to the other major 
narcotics capitals of the world, such as, New York, Rome, and 
Athens. 
  Delhi first witnessed a narcotics boom in the mid-198Os, 
when 
large quantities of heroin were smuggled into the Capital for 
re-export to the West. The drug was produced in the Golden 
Crescent countries to India's north-west or the Golden Triangle 
countries to the east. 
  But due to stringent enforcement of the draconian Narcotics 
and Psychotropic Substances Act, which prescribed the death 
penalty for drug trafficking in the case of second-time 
offenders, there was a marked decline in smuggling to and from 
Delhi. 
  But now India itself has become a major producer of heroin, 
although the bulk is still exported to Western countries. An 
independent survey conducted recently in Delhi and neighbouring 
States reveals that the major source of heroin production here 
is a by-product of legitimate opium cultivation. 
  The Government allows a certain quantity of opium to be 
grown 
legitimately, mainly for medicinal purposes. Clearly, some of 
this is being misused. 
  Though the bulk is smuggled out by the farmers growing the 
opium, there is evidence suggesting pilferage from Central 
Government godowns. The areas earmarked for clandestine growth 
of poppy include Mandsaur and Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh; 
Chittorgarh, Jhalawar, Bhawani Mandi, and Kota is Rajasthan; and 
Bareilly, Badaun, and Bara Banki in Uttar Pradesh. 
  The survey includes interaction with and interviews of 
several small-time traffickers, revenue officers, policemen of 
various States, private highway bus-drivers and operators, 
headmen of JJ [slum areas] clusters of north-east Delhi and a 
large number of addicts who also function as traffickers. 
  However, the most interesting "pattern" of such dope 
trafficking is the fact that the white heroin is of high grade 
of purity. Earlier, i.e., during the mid-80s, the dope used to 
come from across the border for reexport to U.S. or Europe 
through mainly foreign couriers. It was generally found that 
except the heroin coming from Burma and Thailand, the rest 
contained a lot of impurity. It was for this reason that 
international dope markets, mainly western Europe, the Pak 
variety of brown sugar [variety of heroin] was either left 
unsold or fetched a low price. 
  The drugs coming from Rajasthan, UP [Uttar Pradesh], and MP 
[Madhya Pradesh] are indigenously produced. This means that 
after smuggling out the opium from the cultivation points, it is 
converted into heroin in small makeshift laboratories. 
Explaining the system, a senior Revenue official said that the 
process of conversion, though slightly long-drawn and crude, is 
very interesting. 
  Conversions always take place in the night, mainly through 
making of a morphine base from raw opium, and then processing it 
to heroin with the help of some precursor chemicals. After 
smuggling out raw opium, it is generally stored in cool places, 
mainly near wells or sugarcane fields. Precursor chemicals 
required for the process include acetic anhydride and lime and 
potassium permanganate. The make-shift labs where the 
conversion takes place usually have a stove, filtering apparatus 
and charcoal (for purification). 
  However, the sudden rise in the price of heroin and brown 
sugar in the streets of Delhi is due to the Government's 
decision to impose a restriction on the sale and purchase of 
acetic anhydride, which is one of the most basic chemicals 
required in the textile industry. 
  The entire process of conversion takes about four to five 
hours. The manufacturers, who are mainly poor farmers working 
for some cartel, keep shifting the make-shift labs and have 
specific code words as warning signals. It generally needs two 
persons to prepare the chemicals, while a handful stands guard. 
  According to available statistics, Delhi has over 2 lakh 
addicts mainly spread out in north, north-east, and central 
districts. If 0.25 gm of heroin (that is the minimum for a 
moderate addict) is required by an addict, as a `fix' per day, 
the trafficking of dope is over 50 kg daily. In addition, 
another 10 percent, i.e., 5 kg, goes for re-export, mainly to 
the U.S. and Europe. 
  The costing of heroin depends largely on the purity and 
quantum of delivery. The standard white heroin, available in 
the streets of the Walled City or the JJ slums of northeast 
Delhi, is about 55 to 60 per cent pure. The costing also 
depends on the conversion ratio of opium. High-grade heroin 
ratio involves 1 kg heroin from 10 kg opium. 
  The cost of high-grade heroin in Delhi is around Rs. 
[rupees] 
1 lakh a kg, though there are places in Rajasthan and interior 
Madhya Pradesh where the same grade can be obtained at Rs. 
80,000 per kilo. It is known that the price can vary if the 
delivery quantity is big. For example, the Chittorgarh and Kota 
variety has a high demand not only in Delhi but also abroad. 
  The distribution network of the dope flowing into Delhi is 
unique. The Muslim cartels, operating from within the Walled 
City have a different mode of functioning compared to the east 
UP gangs of north-east Delhi and the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled 
Tribe ganglords spread out in the Nizamuddin-Jalvayu Vihar area. 
  The dope always travels into Delhi by carriers comprising 
invalids, old women, minor children, lepers and poor people. 
They generally travel by bus or train. ISBT [interstate bus 
terminal] and the railway stations are always avoided for 
security reasons. Anything from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5,000 depending 
on the quantity the person is carrying, is the commission. In 
fact, a small advance is made initially. The final payment is 
made after delivery is made in Delhi. It was also been noticed 
that such carriers bring in other types of drugs and 
psychotropic substances. 
  The trafficking pattern is organised in such a way that each 
carrier will never carry more than 500 to 750 gm. Each of the 
traffickers has definite points to "offload the take". In the 
Walled City, such offload points are innocuous tea shanty, pan 
[betel leaf] stalls, dispensaries of "hakims" [physicians] or 
even shops selling "ittar" [perfume], "surma" [cosmetic for 
eyebrow] etc. The movement of the dope from one destination to 
the other is almost instant. 
  The JJ colonies of north-east Delhi, mainly Seemapuri, 
Yamuna 
Pushta, Yamuna Nagar, and Kalyanpuri, are notorious for storing 
dope consignments. Like the Walled City, here also the cartels 
work on a community basis. The gang members are generally 
"poorvis" from eastern Uttar Pradesh and, in several cases, 
women are noticed actively operating in transporting the 
consignment from one safe- house to another. The areas which 
are notorious for storing dope in the Walled City are 
Ballimaran, Chitli Kabar, the Jama Masjid area and Turkman Gate. 
  In addition to the regular supply there are at times 
"specific supplies" to a number of small and cheap hotels in 
Paharganj, Ram Bagh, Daryaganj, and Ara Kasha Road. These 
supplies are mostly to foreigners.

  [Text] Beirut, Feb 2 (AFP) - A hitherto unknown Palestinian 
organisation has claimed responsibility for the killing of a 
Jordanian diplomat and warned Norway against hosting any more 
Arab-Israeli peace talks, the pro-Syrian Al-Safir newspaper 
reported on Wednesday [2 February]. 
  An anonymous caller for the so-called Al-Awja Palestinian 
organisation told Al-Safir that his group was "opposed to the 
establishment of peace with the Zionist enemy (Israel)." 
  "All traitors, wherever they may be, will meet the same fate 
as the Jordanian diplomat," 'Umran Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah who was 
shot dead by a gunman outside his Beirut home on Saturday, the 
caller with a fake Palestinian accent said. 
  He also "threatened strikes on Norwegian interests in the 
Middle East if Palestinian-Zionist meetings continue to be held 
on Norwegian territory," the daily added. 
  For several months Norway hosted secret talks between Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organisation which led to the 
signing in Washington on September 13 of a limited autonomy 
accord. 
  Jordan, which is also engaged in peace talks with Israel 
along with the PLO, Lebanon and Syria, has blamed opponents of 
the Middle East peace process for Ma'aytah's killing.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul by </F>
Bisharah Shirbil and 'Ali al-Ruzz in London; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] Those opposed to the regime talk 
about a contradiction in the official political rhetoric 
regarding the Army's preparedness. Sometimes you say it is 
ready to fill the vacuum of Israeli withdrawal and other times 
you stress that the Syrian presence is a necessity because the 
Army's preparedness is not complete yet. 
  [Dallul] I confirm that there is no contradiction. The 
Syrian Army is in Lebanon at the request of the Council of 
Ministers. It has made great sacrifices in defense of Lebanon's 
unity and Arabism. The Syrian presence is a fraternal and 
helping presence. The Syrian military command has never turned 
down any request submitted by us, whether regarding positions 
and posts or with regard to deployment. I consider drawing a 
comparison in this connection a deviation from patriotism. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] We are not comparing the Syrian presence with the 
Israeli Army's presence. We are asking about the duality in the 
rhetoric concerning the [Lebanese] Army's preparedness. 
  [Dallul] Brother, there is no duality. Who is going to 
protect our back if we send three brigades to the south? When 
we entered east Sidon, the Syrians wanted to evacuate the posts 
in 'Aramun, so we asked them to stay to protect the Army's rear. 
And when we entered the southern suburb [of Beirut], they set 
up a big cordon in Beirut to facilitate our job. [passage 
omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Have all arms been collected in the suburb? 
  [Dallul] The arms present in the suburb are individual arms 
for the purpose of defending Hizballah cadres. We have agreed 
with Hizballah on that for the sake of personal protection. The 
picture of what Israel did to Hizballah leaders is still in 
people's mind ('Abbas Musawi's assassination). I believe that 
what is termed security spots is the right of the resistance. 
We still avoid entering the camps lest such a step be 
interpreted in various ways, so how do you expect us to deal 
with a resistance party? Do you want me to deny it even escort 
weapons, when it is engaged in confrontations with Israel? 
  At any rate, Hizballah does not apply the methods applied by 
the Army in its operations, and resistance actions are a 
legitimate right. Our problem with Israel is more a political 
than a security problem. It has been occupying our territory 
for 16 years and yet has not solved its security problem. If it 
withdraws, the problem will end and the Army will take charge of 
security in the south as a whole. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Former Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Subhi 
al-Tufayli said that resistance actions will continue even if 
peace is achieved. 
  [Dallul] When Israel withdraws, no arms will exist except 
[the arms of] legitimacy, and we pledge that. 
  [AL-HAYAH] You pledge and they pledge. Do you not think 
that a confrontation may occur between the two pledges? 
  [Dallul] No confrontation will take place, because Hizballah 
understands the circumstances. It is today talking within the 
resistance framework -- which is its right. It may turn into a 
political tendency when peace is established, in order to 
continue its march. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] If the negotiation stage requires the 
establishment of a Lebanese-Syrian confederation, would you 
support that? 
  [Dallul] It is neither required nor proposed. In its 
present structure Lebanon is the last state that would embark on 
an action of that kind among Arab states. What is required is 
coordination that is in Lebanon's interests. I say in Lebanon's 
interests, because most of the agreements taking place are in 
Lebanon's interests. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Are you prepared to guarantee the oppositionists' 
security if they return to Lebanon? 
  [Dallul] We are willing to do that. Yesterday (the day 
before yesterday) Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri contacted 
Raymond Iddih and had a long conversation with him. 
  [AL-HAYAH] And General 'Awn? 
  [Dallul] There is an agreement stipulating that he should 
stay abroad for a certain period. When this period ends, there 
will be no problem. Besides, he is violating the agreement. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] What is your opinion of Lebanese Forces leader 
Dr. Samir Ja'ja''s visit to al-Qardahah? 
  [Dallul] Excellent. I am one of those who contributed to 
establishing a dialogue between Syria and the "Forces." The 
first meeting took place between Brigadier Ghazi Kan'an and 
Forces officials in my house in al-Biqa'. We want national 
rallying around the national concept: to differ politically 
over what Lebanon should be, not how to destroy Lebanon. 
  [AL-HAYAH] It is noted that there is greater involvement by 
military courts in the arrests taking place. 
  [Dallul] And how many detainees do you think there are? Not 
more than 12. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Political detainees? 
  [Dallul] There are no political detainees in Lebanon. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Amnesty International said there is torture. 
  [Dallul] I challenge it to provide one proof or one name.

  [Text] Army Commander General Emile Lahhud has warned that 
Israel might escalate its aggression on the south because of 
what he called differences among Israeli officials on withdrawal 
from the occupied Arab territories. 
  In his monthly interview with the AL-JAYSH [Army] magazine, 
Lahhud called on the Army to raise the level of its preparedness 
to prevent Israel from using the south and local security 
incidents to its advantage during peace negotiations. 
  He stressed that only just and comprehensive solutions can 
bring about the kind of peace that protects dignity. He 
remarked that solidarity between Lebanon and Syria is the 
backbone of domestic stability. 
  Lahhud added that the Army has recently apprehended all 
violators in the north and south and that investigations into 
the Phalangist Party headquarters explosion have reached a 
serious stage.

  [Excerpts] Cypriot Minister of Communications and Works 
Adhamos Adhamidhis left Beirut for Larnaca this afternoon after 
a three-day visit to Lebanon during which he held talks with his 
Lebanese counterpart Muhammad Ghaziri. 
  A technical cooperation and coordination accord between the 
two countries was signed. It aims to promote Lebanese-Cypriot 
relations in posts and communications and the services linked to 
them. 
  Minister Ghaziri announced the formation of a technical 
committee comprised of Lebanese and Cypriots to draft an 
agreement on laying an undersea communications axial fiber cable 
between the two countries. He added that efforts are under way 
to extend an undersea cable with a capacity of 8000 axial lines. 
The first phase will begin with 4000 lines, of which Syria will 
have 16 percent with the remainder shared equally between 
Lebanon and Cyprus. [passage omitted] 
  The Cypriot minister, who also called on Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz, said the ongoing negotiations mark the start of 
important cooperation to develop ties between the two countries. 
He hoped that the accord will be a prelude to the continuation 
of good contacts between the two countries.

  [Excerpts] The assassination of the Jordanian diplomat in 
Beirut, Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, has opened the door wide for 
speculation. Our sources assert, however, that there is much 
more to it than meets the eye. 
  Our information indicates that the martyr was not just an 
ordinary employee who had specific duties at our embassy in 
Beirut, and that he had worked there only nine months and not a 
year as was previously announced. He had performed similar 
duties at our embassy in Cairo. 
  Observers in the know link the assassination to domestic and 
foreign developments that have to do with the peace process and 
Jordan's strained relations with several radical movements, 
specifically allied with the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Interviewed by AL-BILAD, al-Ma'ayitah's relatives told the 
paper al-Ma'ayitah had a very sharp mind. He was a man who 
belonged to his homeland and nation, his brother Najib 
al-Ma'ayitah said. 
  This gives an indication, one of the ministers told us, of 
the nature of the special national tasks performed by the martyr 
in the Lebanese arena. This is especially true since 
al-Ma'ayitah's killers stole a very important file the martyr 
was carrying with him, and not in his briefcase, immediately 
after the assassination. 
  Our sources link this file to problems that arose recently 
between the government and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The 
sources recall His Majesty King Husayn's remarks a month ago 
about considering taking official measures regarding diplomatic 
relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  The sources further say that a Jordanian decision was made 
last Thursday [27 January] according to which the Iranian side 
was told to reduce its diplomatic mission in Amman, which has 33 
people. Our sources say that the security agencies believe most 
of them are Iranian security officers. 
  Active Iranian sources in Amman told AL-BILAD the Jordanian 
ambassador in Tehran was the target of several attacks by 
Iranian groups last month. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry, 
however, chose not to go public about the attacks, although it 
addressed official memorandums to its Iranian counterpart in 
this regard. 
  These sources say that Amman has recently witnessed more 
activities by extremist groups that previously operated in Syria 
and Lebanon and visited Iran. 
  The sources assert that the Jordanian security agencies have 
arrested and interrogated many members of those groups, and that 
some of them are still detained, following the explosion that 
occurred at the Cinema Rivoli in downtown Amman. 
  The security organs had received word about a small bomb 
that 
went off almost a month ago at the same theater. The explosion 
was followed by private calls explaining that it was a 
light-caliber message. Jordanian security services kept a tight 
lid on the second explosion last Wednesday, before locating the 
detonator. [passage omitted] 
  Jordanian Foreign Ministry sources say the Ministry has 
sent a special fact-finding committee to Lebanon to investigate 
the sinful operation and find out who is behind it. 
  Security reports began to link the assassination attempt to 
the group of Abu-Nidal, Sabri al-Banna. Lebanese sources told 
Jordanian security officers that they suspect al-Banna is 
involved in the operation. Consequently, our information says, 
the Jordanian security men left immediately for Lebanon. 
  Lebanese security agencies currently regard the Abu-Nidal 
group as the second suspect in the operation, especially since 
it is rumored that five leaders of the group are jailed in 
Jordan. Our government denies the five are in Jordan, despite 
the fact that it has released some of the movement's cadres 
after being detained for two months. 
  Our informed sources, however, confirm that the Jordanian 
agencies have recently received a thank-you note from Abu-Nidal 
after releasing the movement's sequestered property in Amman, 
which includes documents, offices, furniture, and other items. 
The note also demanded that the movement's five leaders be 
released. The Jordanian Government denies it is holding them. 
  Security sources do not rule out a possible connection 
between Abu-Nidal and the operation. The sources, however, 
think most likely there is a joint operation in which the 
pro-Iran groups drew on Abu-Nidal's experience, since he has a 
rich record of involvement in liquidating Jordanian diplomats 
over the past 10 years. Abu-Nidal is trying to break the tight 
siege imposed by our security agencies on his activities in 
Jordan, since he has repeatedly tried to create a main theater 
of operations in Jordan by contacting figures that cooperated 
with him to use him as a pressure card against the Palestinian 
leadership when the negotiating process faces any impasse. 
  Expressing his movement's domestic crisis in light of the 
negotiating process, Abu-Nidal issued a statement on 29 November 
in which he threatened to take action against the interests of 
Arab regimes. The statement emphasized Jordan, since it is the 
second party, after the Palestinians, that is directly concerned 
with the peace process. 
  The Iranian side, which rejects the negotiating process, has 
incited its subsidiary Islamic and Palestinian movements, 
drawing their attention to the serious Jordanian role in this 
context. This is especially true since Jordan and the PLO have 
signed an agreement and the fact that the Iranians have lost the 
Syrian card, which was also lost by the anti-'Arafat Palestinian 
movements. Those movements are now looking for an objective and 
geographical alternative to Syria to express their rejection of 
the negotiations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Highlights" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "U.S. Pressure and </F>
the Internal Front"] 
  [Text] Jordan is being exposed to immense and unprecedented 
U.S. pressure that is accompanied -- openly or implicitly -- by 
economic, political, and security threats. The Americans want 
Jordan unilaterally to end the economic boycott of Israel, 
before achieving a peace treaty, while Israel, in its turn, will 
give nothing in return. They are pressuring Jordan to 
expeditiously sign a peace treaty with Israel and not to wait 
for a comprehensive solution on the Palestinian and Syrian 
tracks. They are also exerting pressure toward holding meetings 
between Jordan and Israel on the highest levels without any 
preconditions and before resolving the pending problems or 
signing a peace treaty just to record achievements for the U.S. 
Administration in the interest of Israel. 
  What the Americans are asking from Jordan is neither 
requested nor expected by Israel itself. They are asking for 
this without making any concession to Jordan with regard to the 
blockade imposed on al-'Aqabah, reducing Jordan's debts, or 
without putting pressure on Israel for the sake of creating a 
balance. They want us to tighten the blockade on sisterly Iraq, 
which has implemented the Security Council resolutions, and, at 
the same time, end the boycott of Israel which has not 
implemented one single resolution. 
  If Jordan does not succumb to this American pressure, its 
punishment will be: the freezing of aid, tightening the siege 
of al-'Aqabah, protesting the flow of Iraqi oil to Jordan, 
pressuring the IMF to fabricate an excuse to withhold its 
adoption of the economic reform program -- and consequently not 
to reduce or reschedule the debts, and also instigating some 
sides stationed in Jordan to undermine internal stability. 
  Such pressure was exerted here in Amman by the visiting U.S. 
delegations such as the secretary of commerce and the 
Congressmen who visited Jordan recently. Pressure was also 
exerted in Washington with the ranking Jordanian delegation. In 
order for such pressures to bear fruit, an atmosphere of 
instability needs to be created so as to confuse the government 
and make it feel that it is living in a mine field and that it 
is fighting on many internal and external fronts, and 
consequently, the state will lose its stability. 
  The following are signs of the atmosphere that is being 
created to subjugate Jordan: 
  The attempt to torpedo the sales tax law to justify 
cancellation of the economic reform program and a return of the 
1988 crisis which resulted from our debts; 
  The cinema blast on the pretext that the cinema shows 
pornographic films, to accuse Islamic sides of the blast and 
drive a wedge between these sides and the government. 
  The differences with the PLO and the return of concern, 
fear, 
and hegemony attempts. 
  The assassination of a Jordanian diplomat. 
  The atmosphere created by the food and medicine bomb hurled 
-- with good intention -- by the minister of health at the right 
time. And more to come. 
  The factors that will guarantee our steadfastness in the 
face 
of pressures are: a cohesive internal front--through carrying 
out investigations and questioning for the sake of the homeland 
and reform, and not just to register stands; seeking the 
participation of all parties and not excluding any force; 
respect for institutions; popular awakening; and responsible 
acts.

<F P=106> [By 'Isam Qadamani] </F>
  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali 
received at his office yesterday Palestinian ambassador in Cairo 
Sa'id Kamal. 
  The Palestinian ambassador updated the prime minister on the 
negotiations on the Palestinian track, particularly with regard 
to the Davos meetings between PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  In a statement to reporters after the meeting, Kamal said 
that the Palestinian leadership has made no concessions during 
the Davos talks. He added that the Davos talks resulted in a 
convergence of views on the arrangements pertaining to security 
and withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
  Sa'id Kamal said that the Palestinian and Israeli sides 
agreed on a two-month withdrawal period, during which 
negotiations will continue, and a four-month period for the 
implementation of the agreement. [passage omitted] 
  The Palestinian ambassador indicated that the implementation 
of the arrangements pertaining to security and withdrawal is 
contingent upon the key decisionmaker in Israel; that is, the 
prime minister. Kamal added: Nonetheless, out of a high sense 
of responsibility, I would like to tell Rabin: Enough is 
enough. What we have offered in Cairo and Davos should prompt 
both sides to sign an agreement on the arrangements to be made. 
Once this is achieved, the drafting committee can start its 
work to finalize relevant issues before the start of troop 
withdrawal. 
  Kamal went on to say: In the aftermath of the meeting 
between 'Arafat and Rabin in Cairo, the Israeli rulers have been 
procrastinating a great deal over implementation. [passage 
omitted] 
  In response to a question, Kamal said: We and Jordan are a 
single body, regardless of the summer clouds that may appear on 
the horizon. This will remain the case regardless of whether or 
not certain parties like it.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has received a cable from 
Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi in which he condemned the 
criminal action of assassinating martyr Na'ib 'Umran 
al-Ma'ayitah, the counselor at the Jordanian Embassy in Beirut. 
  In his cable, President al-Hirawi emphasized that Lebanon 
condemns violence and is eager to avoid damaging relations 
between Jordan and sisterly Lebanon or any act against security 
and stability in Lebanon. 
  President al-Hirawi told His Majesty King Husayn that the 
competent Lebanese organizations have embarked on the necessary 
arrangements and measures concerning the criminal incident, and 
that these organizations were instructed to coordinate with the 
concerned Jordanian authorities to identify the perpetrators of 
this criminal action.

  [Text] Doha-QNA--Press reports said yesterday that the 
Jordanian Government has made an initial decision to abrogate 
the secondary and tertiary boycott of Israel, and that it is 
waiting for the Arab League decision on ending the primary 
boycott. 
  Quoting official Jordanian sources, newspaper AL-SHARQ said 
the new official Jordanian move has come following the recent 
visit to Amman by U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, during 
which he demanded ending the secondary and tertiary boycotts of 
Israel that restrict U.S. companies' activities in the Middle 
East.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Fair Demand"] </F>
  [Text] Jordan has the right to receive compensation, as 
stipulated by the UN Charter, for the economic difficulties and 
losses it has suffered, and for the adverse effects caused by 
its commitment to, and implementation of, Security Council 
Resolution 661 of 1990, regarding the imposition of economic 
sanctions on Iraq. 
  Jordan, which emphasized its commitment to the international 
legitimacy and Security Council resolutions, and which 
implemented them as part of international law, should not pay a 
heavy price for such a commitment and for its respect for the 
international resolutions and UN Charter. 
  Jordan has suffered a lot. It has endured the results of 
major developments in the Middle East more than any other party. 
This has substantially harmed its economy, and its limited 
capabilities have been overburdened. This situation has 
obstructed its economic, development, and social plans. 
  Since Jordan is geographically in a central location, and 
since it depends on transport, transit, a free market, and the 
Gulf of Aqaba, and because several projects depend mainly on the 
Iraqi market, the imposition of an embargo on Iraq, together 
with Jordan's commitment to implementing Resolution 661, has 
caused Jordan losses of $300 million annually. This does not 
include the losses caused by the siege imposed on al-'Aqabah 
port; that is to say the inspection and diversion of ships. 
This situation has adverse effects on Jordanian citizens and 
Jordanian trade in general. 
  Jordan's firm commitment to peace in the Middle East, and 
its 
efforts to reach a just and comprehensive peace in the region at 
the same time it is eagerly trying to establish democracy and 
human rights should urge the international community, 
represented by the Security Council and the international 
organization, to support this effort and entrench the concept of 
justice in applying the resolutions of the international 
legitimacy and the UN Charter. 
  The prime minister presented the Security Council's 
sanctions 
committee with documents containing facts and figures on 
Jordan's losses resulting from the implementation of Resolution 
661 and its commitment to this resolution. The sanctions 
committee and the influential states in the international 
organization should respond to these fair Jordanian demands 
because we should not be rewarded for our commitment and 
implementation of the international legitimacy and its 
resolutions with more losses, pressures, and frustration.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An Arms Package Offer?"] </F>
  [Text] A US State Department team is said to be in 
Islamabad to discuss, what is being termed a `package deal' on 
nuclear non-proliferation. If so, it points to two fairly clear 
conclusions. One, that the device of Pressler Amendment, 
intended by the US to arm-twist Pakistan into accepting the US 
diktat on nuclear development, had failed to achieve its goals. 
And two, that Pakistan's perception of a threat to its security 
was leading it into an arms race with India. The realisation 
that two important countries of South Asia were sinking their 
vital economic resources into highly unproductive channels 
because of a dangerous dispute over Kashmir, may have obliged 
the US recently into pressurising Pakistan and India to find a 
diplomatic solution. The failure of the Secretary-level talks 
between the two countries must have convinced the US that India 
though willing to go through the motions of a dialogue, was not 
really serious in solving the Kashmir issue. And so long as the 
core of the conflict remained unresolved, no progress on the 
nuclear option, that Pakistan was unwilling to give up, was 
possible. And hence the visit of the US team. The reasoning in 
the State Department could be that India remaining adamant on 
Kashmir and rattling its sword for a so-called `limited war', 
Pakistan would be driven to the wall and could unfreeze its 
nuclear programme. Working on this hypotheses the US team could 
have brought in a `package' to basically address two problems of 
an immediate nature. First, to persuade Pakistan not to 
unfreeze its nuclear programme and secondly, to remedy to some 
extent the danger that the Pressler Amendment had done to 
Pakistan's defence capability. That both objectives are 
interlinked is obvious, but while the first objective can be 
presumed to be certain, the second is not. The US negotiators, 
for example, could threaten Pakistan with further damage to its 
security as a penalty for unfreezing of its nuclear programme. 
That would obviously be totally counterproductive but it would 
not be the first time the US did something that achieved the 
opposite of what was intended. 
  Having said that, it also needs to be said that unless two 
parallel lines of action are adopted, the US team's mission is 
doomed. In the short term, the incentive for an attack on 
Pakistan will have to be removed from the minds of the Indian 
leadership. The Indians could be thinking that deprived of 
conventional arms by the US, Pakistan is now weak enough to be 
taken out in a short surgical strike. India will have to be 
disabused of such a notion on the one hand and Pakistan's 
defence shored up on the other. In the longer term, India will 
have to be persuaded to give Kashmir to Kashmiris or suffer 
harsh UN-supported sanctions.

  [Text] Khalid Ahmad Kharal, the federal minister for 
information and broadcasting, said that during the rule of the 
Islamic Democratic Alliance and its mentor and patron, General 
Zia al-Haq, local bodies were misused for personal 
aggrandizement of the ruling alliance leaders. He was 
commenting on the statement by the opposition leader, in which 
he had criticized the dissolution of local bodies. He said 
during the 1988 and 1990 elections, the funds for local bodies 
were used to run the election campaigns of the Muslim League and 
its allied parties. On both the occasions, Pakistan Muslim 
League-Nawaz group used local bodies' funds for personal 
purposes, which forced the caretaker government to dissolve the 
local councils before the 1990 elections in order to ensure free 
and fair elections were conducted. 
  The information and broadcasting minister said that Mian 
Nawaz Sharif also received substantial assistance from Israel to 
destabilize the then government. The assistance was provided in 
the form of steel scraps through Israeli agents either free or 
at a nominal price. An Israeli ship named (Jamatul) delivered 
27,500 tons of scrap worth 240 million rupees.

  [Text] Famous commander of Hezb-e Eslami Jalaluddin Haqqani 
has taken the initiative to arrange a ceasefire in Afghanistan, 
reliable source said. 
  Haqqani has formed a 100-member reconciliation council to 
achieve his aim. Prominent religious leaders, intellectuals and 
outstanding commanders have been included in the council. Two 
representatives each of the three provincial governments of 
Laghman, Nangathar and Kunar are also included in the council. 
The 45-member Commanders Shura of Kabul has also nominated two 
of its commanders to the reconciliation body. 
  The four major parties of the Afghan fighters are also 
included in the council which has already opened peace 
negotiations with the concerned parties. The chief of the 
council, Commander Haqqani, according to the source had a 
detailed meeting with Commander Sadiq near Kabul on Tuesday. 
Commander Sadiq who is representing Harakat-e Enquilab-e Eslami 
played a key role in the reconciliation bid by the 45-member 
Commanders Shura last month. 
  The Afghan prime minister Golboddin Hekmatyar accepted the 
Commanders Shura call for his resignation while president 
Rabbani rejected it as under the formula of Commanders Shura he 
was also supposed to step down as president to elect an interim 
government. 
  According to Haqqani sources, the Hezb-e Eslami (Hekmatyar) 
and Jamiat-e Eslami have asked Haqqani to take initiative for a 
reconciliation. Jamiat-e Eslami is willing to enter into peace 
talks with Hezb-e Eslami but not with its war partner Gen. 
Rashid Dostum. Hezb-e Eslami is not ready to hold negotiations 
with Jamiat unless president Rabbani resigns his office. 
  Meanwhile, the governor of Nangathar, Commander Qadeer, has 
proposed a grand gathering of the commanders, ulama and the 
representatives of all the Afghan parties to be held at 
Jalalabad, as soon as possible. According to the Afghan source, 
Governor Qadeer made this proposal while addressing a big 
gathering of prominent Afghan figures including religious 
leaders and commanders at Jalalabad on Tuesday. 
  Qadeer said he would support all those moves aimed at to 
arrange a ceasefire in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan. He 
said he was in touch with the leaders of the warring parties in 
Afghanistan for a peaceful settlement in his country. 
  The sources close to another prominent Afghan leader, Prof. 
Abdol Rab Rasool Sayyaf, said in Peashawar on Tuesday that 
Sayyaf had asked President Rabbani and Prime Minister Hekmatyar 
to remove the communist elements from their ranks. Sayyaf is 
helping Rabbani in the ongoing Kabul war against Hekmatyar. One 
of the famous commanders of Sayyaf's party, Ittehad-e Eslami, 
Taj Mohammad is defending presidential palace at the first 
defence line at Pule Mehmood Khan in Kabul with his over 1800 
fighters. 
  Meanwhile, the supply of foods and other essential goods 
from 
Peshawar to Kabul is continued. A Soviet-made transport plane 
landed at the Peshawar airport on Tuesday. Another transport 
plane carrying the relief goods from Saudi Arabia took off from 
Peshawar airport on Monday, the official sources said.

  [Text] The prime minister, Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, has 
urged the community of nations to uphold the universal 
declaration of human rights and to act to stop the massacre 
going on in occupied Kashmir. 
  Addressing the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva today, 
she described the gross human rights violations against innocent 
and unarmed Kashmiris as reminiscent of the darkest days of the 
Nazi Germany. She said the situation there is intolerable. The 
people of held Kashmir are demanding just their freedom. They 
cannot be suppressed indefinitely. She pointed out that despite 
its repression, India has failed to impose its will on the 
indomitable people of Jammu and Kashmir, and intensity of their 
resistance has grown. The Kashmiri political leadership, 
representing over (?30) parties and groups, has unanimously 
declared not to contemplate any solution involving the 
continuation of Indian rule. 
  The prime minister's address was warmly and repeatedly 
applauded by the audience. 
  Referring to the recently held Pak-India talks, the prime 
minister said Pakistan had hoped to meaningfully address all 
aspects of the dispute. Pakistan stressed upon India to seek a 
peaceful rather than a military solution to the Kashmir dispute, 
and take visible steps to reduce repression. Instead the 
repression increased. Over 40,000 Kashmiri men, women, and 
children have been killed so far. 
  The prime minister demanded that the representatives of 
Kashmiri people should be allowed to come and inform the 
commission of the repression to which they are being subjected, 
and the commission should investigate these violations of human 
rights. Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto said: It is time for the world 
community to prevail upon India to remove its additional forces 
from held Kashmir, in order to put an end to its repression. It 
is also time for the world community to force India to free the 
imprisoned Kashmiri leaders, lift the Draconian emergency laws 
and stop its army to commit all forms of atrocities in Kashmir, 
and, finally, allow international human rights organizations, 
humanitarian organizations, and media men to visit Kashmir to 
ascertain the facts and provide help to the suffering Kashmiris. 
  She said the settlement of the Kashmir dispute based on the 
wishes of the people is the key to peace and progress in South 
Asia, reiterating that Pakistan is committed to seeking a 
peaceful solution of the Kashmir dispute, as it would pave the 
way to normalization of relations between Pakistan and India. 
[sentence as heard] 
  The prime minister also urged the world community to help 
preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and 
demanded that the consequences of ethnic cleansing must be 
reversed. She said the genocide in Bosnia has been continuing 
for the past two years. The Security Council has failed to help 
the victims of aggression. Humanitarian help has become an 
excuse to avoid collective action against the aggressor. The 
European Community approved high sounding principles but failed 
to stop the aggressor. This state of affairs should end in order 
to ensure peace, freedom, and justice for the Bosnian people. 
  The prime minister said Pakistan's aim is to provide a life 
of dignity to its people by banishing poverty and illiteracy, 
ensuring the rights of women and their full participation in 
society, providing full protection to our children and 
safeguarding the basic rights of minorities. 
  Later, addressing a news conference, the prime minister 
urged 
India to reduce its level of repression in occupied Kashmir. 
This would be a visible signal from New Delhi that it is 
sincere in holding talks over the Kashmiri dispute. 
  Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan cannot afford to 
ignore 
what is happening in held Kashmir, because it is our common 
responsibility to ensure that the Kashmiris get the right of 
self determination.

  [Text] Islamabad -- The arrival of Chinese team for 
negotiations with Pakistani officials and experts for the sale 
of three S-20, diesel-electric powered submarines, has been put 
off for two weeks. 
  The Chinese team, which will also include officials of the 
China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) -- the manufacturer 
of S-20 submarine -- was earlier scheduled to arrive here by 
January 31 for detailed negotiations on the possibility of 
selling out three units of S-20 to Pakistan. 
  Official sources told `The News' on Thursday: "Now the 
Chinese team will reach here towards the end of first half of 
February." 
  The CSSC is offering its on-trial newly-designed S-20 
submarines to Pakistan. The cost of three units will be nearly 
540 million US dollars. 
  Meanwhile, week-long talks with Swedish team for T-96 have 
already been completed and detailed negotiations with the 
visiting French team are currently under way for Agosta 90B 
submarine which is an ungraded but non-nuclear version of Agosta 
being manufactured by DCN-I of France. 
  Official sources confirmed that talks for the purchase of 
submarines are being held only with three countries, France, 
Sweden and China. These sources say that "though possibility of 
negotiations with any other country cannot be totally ruled out, 
at present Pakistan has not invited any other country, except 
these three, for negotiations on the particular subject." 
  Defence sources told 'The News' that Pakistan wants to sign 
the contract for the purchase of three submarines as early as 
possible once the on-going process of pre-contract negotiations 
with these three countries are completed.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb 2, IRNA -- The Iranian Air Force, in 
complete control and fully vigilant, would not allow any 
aggression on Iranian territory, said Air Force Commander 
Brigadier General Mansur Sattari in an interview with the 
English morning daily TEHRAN TIMES today. 
  Speaking to the daily, the top Air Force official referred 
to 
the last Friday's Turkish air assault on Iranian border areas 
and noted that the attack was not aimed at Iranian territory as 
the Islamic Republic forces were in full control of the borders. 
  "It was by mistake that the Turkish missile landed in 
Iranian 
territory and 28 of our citizens were martyred or injured," 
Sattari said, "No Turkish fighter plane entered Iranian 
territory,... The Turkish pilots were not experienced or mature 
enough to avoid the tragedy." 
  The general also denied reports that the Turkish planes 
violated Iran's airspace and said that the recent incident 
occured because Iran's residential areas were too close to the 
borders. 
  Gen. Sattari also stated that the Air Force at the moment 
was 
totally freed from its previous intense dependence on the U.S. 
and that it was not only run by an all-Iranian personnel, but 
also provided educational services to some of the Islamic 
countries. 
  As for the Persian Gulf security, the paper quoted the 
official as saying "we are not appalled by the presence of 
foreign warships in the region, in fact we are fully ready to 
counter any suspicious move and our warplanes are at all times 
guarding the country's airspace." 
  Commenting on the post-war reconstruction of the Air Force, 
he said that the reconstruction had reached completion. The 
goal of self-sufficiency, he said, was now within the reach of 
the Air Force. The Air Force experience in achieving 
self-sufficiency could serve as a model for other governmental 
bodies, he said. 
  Earlier in the day, Sattari visited the Air Force exhibition 
in which the latest achievements of different divisions within 
the Air Force were put on display.

  [Text] Sardasht, W. Azarbaijan Prov. Feb. 2, IRNA -- The 
Turkish delegation headed by the Turkish Foreign Ministry 
official, Ogur Dugan, visited two villages in 'Qassemrash' 
region here Tuesday. 
  The delegation is currently here to meet families of the 
victims of the last Friday [28 January] air strike of Turkish 
jet fighters against two Iranian border villages. 
  While inspecting the villages, Dugan expressed deep regret 
over the incident and stressed that the attack had been 
unintentional. 
  The delegation, arrived in Orumiyeh, the provincial capital, 
last Monday, also took photographs of unexploded bombs and 
rockets fired by the Turkish warplanes. The delegation was 
accompanied by a number of Turkish military experts. 
  One of the villagers whose wife had been injured in the 
incident, argued why the Turkish Government had bombed Iranian 
border villages and farmers. 
  In response Dugan said Ankara and Tehran were two friendly 
countries, adding that Turkey would convince Iran it had no 
intention to attack the villages. 
  As a result of the air strike of Turkish warplanes last 
Friday, nine villagers were killed and 19 others wounded in 
Qassemrash region. 
  The delegation has so far visited a number of wounded 
villagers hospitalized in Orumiyeh.

  [Text] Following the plot by a limited number of 
counterrevolutionaries on Tuesday who had congregated in one of 
the streets in Zahedan and intended to create agitation and 
disturbances, the Secretariat of the Supreme National Security 
Council issued a statement last night, the text of which is as 
follows: 
  A number of elements who--in the course of the measures 
taken 
by the security forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the 
eastern border areas of the country--perceived that they could 
attain their lost interests congregated in one of the streets in 
Zahedan. They broke the windows of some residential buildings 
and damaged some vehicles passing on the streets, including 
those of the law enforcement forces. In performing their 
legitimate duties and in order to restore law and order, the law 
enforcement forces therefore intervened and began dispersing 
these people and arresting the disruptive elements.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
  The vigilant people know that the enemies of the Islamic 
revolution have always been apprehensive about the Muslim 
nation's presence on the scene, especially during the Ten Days 
of Dawn, the symbol of the greatness and grandeur of Islam and 
the people of Iran. At various times, they have sought to 
neutralize or undermine this action. 
  The incident at the mausoleum of the imam, may God be 
pleased 
with him, proved that during the festivities to mark the victory 
of the Islamic revolution, the powers of world arrogance and the 
enemies of the Islamic revolution intend to stage incidents to 
disrupt the popular activity. 
  What we witnessed yesterday affirms the vigilance and 
alertness of the people, who, for the past 15 years, have 
maintained an active presence on the scene of the defense of the 
Islamic revolution and on the line of the late imam. The 
people's slogans following the random shooting at the sacred 
precincts of the [mausoleum of] the Islamic revolution's founder 
indicate that the plots of the enemies of Islam and the Islamic 
revolution are ineffective and constitute a declaration of 
allegiance to the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Everyone should know, at this critical time for the Islamic 
revolution and the country's construction, when the enemies' 
hopes are being turned into despondency, that only vigilance and 
alertness and knowledgeable action can steer the Islamic 
revolution toward its lofty goals. 
  Everyone should know that the powers of world arrogance fear 
the Ten Days of Dawn and the celebration of the Day of God 
[Yawm- Allah] on 11 February. The 11 February marches have 
already perturbed the Islamic revolution's enemies. This year, 
as in previous years, the people will again display their 
unified presence at the 11 February marches and reaffirm their 
unwavering determination to safeguard the revolution's gains--to 
the chagrin of their enemies.

<F P=106> [Report by Laurent Maillard] </F>
  [Text] Tehran, Feb 2 (AFP)--Several people were injured and 
others arrested in a rare outburst of sectarian violence in 
southeast Iran, marring celebrations for the 15th anniversary of 
the Islamic republic, newspapers said Wednesday. 
  The protest on Tuesday came the same day as a gunman fired 
shots during a speech by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  And the mainly Shiite Muslim country's economic plight also 
cast a shadow over the anniversary when parliament cut the 
annual budget. 
  An angry crowd gathered Tuesday outside the main mosque in 
Zahedan, one of the few Iranian cities with a Sunni Muslim 
majority, after rumours spread that a Sunni mosque had been 
destroyed in Mashhad in northeastern Iran. 
  "Counter-revolutionary elements joined the crowd and started 
throwing stones at the police, breaking shop windows," HAMSHARI 
newspaper said. 
  The interior ministry described the violence as a "counter- 
revolutionary plot" and said public buildings, houses and 
military vehicles had been attacked. 
  The security forces arrested demonstrators who wanted to 
"sow 
disorder and trouble in Zahedan" at the start of the official 
ceremonies marking the anniversary of the 1979 revolution which 
toppled the shah, the ministry said. 
  No figure was given for the number of demonstrators 
involved. 
  "Counter-revolutionary elements gathered in Khayyam Avenue 
and began ripping down the Iranian flags and smashing the party 
lights decorating the street for the anniversary of the 
revolution," the ministry said. 
  The newspaper KEYHAN reported Tuesday that the armed 
opposition group the People's Mojahedin [Mojahedin-e Khalq 
Organization, MKO] was preparing "terrorist activities" in 
Sistan va Baluchestan province, of which Zahedan is the main 
town, "with the backing of Saudi Arabia," which sees itself as 
the leader of the Sunni branch of Islam. 
  Also Tuesday, a gunman fired shots as Rafsanjani delivered a 
speech at the mausoleum of the republic's founder, Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeyni. Police arrested a 26-year-old man who said 
he had only wanted to frighten the crowd. 
  Rafsanjani, standing 50 meters (yards) away and shielded by 
an aide, kept his composure and did not interrupt his speech at 
the shrine in southern Tehran. "There was nothing to worry 
about," he told Tehran Radio later. 
  The noise panicked some in the crowd of several thousand who 
had gathered to celebrate the first of the 10 days which led to 
the revolution, known here as "Fajr" (dawn). 
  After the incident the crowd started shouting "Rafsanjani, 
we 
support you" and "death to the hypocrites," in reference to the 
armed opposition. On the economic front, the Iranian 
parliament adopted an austerity budget for 1994-1995, trimming 
the government's proposed draft by 12 percent because of low oil 
revenues. 
  Parliament lowered the forecast for overall revenues to 17 
billion dollars, down from the government's target of 19.2 
billion dollars. The budget was cut by 12 percent, from 45.5 
billion dollars to 40 billion dollars. 
  MPs also chopped 20 percent off the revenue forecast from 
oil 
exports for the next Iranian year -- running from March 21, 1994 
to March 20, 1995 -- from 12.8 billion dollars to 10.15 billion 
dollars. 
  The price of a barrel of crude was estimated at 13 dollars, 
while the government had forecast 14.5 dollars.

  [Text] The national budget bill for the year 1373 
[beginning in March 1994] passed its first reading by the Majles 
deputies following their approval of the total government 
revenues. 
  According to a report by the Central News Unit, the single 
article of the bill was approved in today's open session of the 
Majles and in its first reading. 
  Next year's budget, in terms of revenues and funds provided 
from other sources, as well as expenditures and costs, is 
69,772,752,907,000 rials. The general state budget, in terms of 
revenues and expenditures, is 32,303,350,987,000 rials. 
  According to the bill, the general revenue and funds 
provided 
from other sources are 30,048,946,179,000 rials, the special 
income from ministries and state organizations 2,254,404,808,000 
rials and the budget for state organization, banks, and state 
affiliated nonprofit organizations, in terms of income and funds 
provided from other sources is 45.4539 trillion rials. 
  According to the approved single article, should there be an 
increase in the foreign currency oil sale income from $10.1543 
billion to $11.840 billion, the extra income will be spent on 
the repayment of the country's foreign currency commitments, and 
the surplus will be spent on projects indicated in the bill and 
to cover shortage of credit in development plans. 
  The spokesman for the Majles commission on plans and budget 
explained the changes in the budget bill and said: in comparison 
to the bill presented by the government, the national budget has 
been decreased by some 10 trillion rials, while the general 
budget has been decreased by 3.7 trillion rials, and the gross 
change that must be kept in mind during the second reading is 
about 2.22 billion rials. 
  At the beginning of the open Majles session this afternoon, 
deputy speaker Hasan Rowhani, who was in the seat of the 
speaker, congratulated the deputies on the anniversary of the 
return of the Imam Khomeyni to the Islamic motherland on 1 
February 1979 and spoke of this day as an unforgettable holy day. 
  Mr. Hasan Rowhani referred to the various plots by the world 
arrogant powers in creating confusion among the ever-vigilant 
people of the country and pointed to the shooting incident this 
morning at the start of the sacred 10 Days of Dawn ceremonies in 
the pure shrine of his excellency, the imam. 
  He said: in a naive illusion and a childish move and by 
firing several aimless shots into the air, the enemy imagined he 
could disperse the people and disrupt the festivities marking 
the 16th spring of freedom. 
  He emphasized: Such actions will definitely be to the loss 
of 
the enemy, and our people will not change their ways because of 
such childish acts. They will continue to participate, actively 
and with better spirit, in the festivities and other fields of 
revolution.

<F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, </F>
head of the judiciary, in Tehran on 28 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] I would like to indicate another 
point and, in reality, tell you about my own belief and then say 
several sentences on the general deputization [niyabat-e 'ammeh 
-- reference to eminent Shiite religious scholars guiding the 
ummah on behalf of the disappeared imam] 
  I say that the imam of the age, may God hasten his advent, 
who has the responsibility for managing the Shiites -- or the 
Islamic ummah -- is, we say, our 12th Imam. He is alive, 
observant and present. He awaits and is waited for. He will 
spread justice throughout the world by his presence. Perhaps it 
should be said that the Islamic ummah is managed through his 
imamate. Taking into cosideration our Islamic knowledge, it 
must be said that the lives of human beings are connected with 
the existence of the imam. Speaking more carefully on this 
matter, it must be said that the existence of the totality of 
life [jahan-e hasti] is connected with the existence of the 
imam. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the type of guidance and leadership under the 
conditions of absence [the time during which the 12th imam has 
absented himself], for example in our time, we think that if the 
imam of the age observes that a problem is going to emerge so 
that the foundations of shar'iah -- and under our conditions, 
the foundations of sovereignty -- are threatened he will give 
guidance by any reasoning possible and in any way possible. He 
will correct the mistake. He will guide so that the danger does 
not come about for the Shiites or the Islamic ummah. 
  At the beginning of the great absence we came across a 
problem when a jurisconsult would issue a fatwa [religious 
edict]. Then it would become clear that he has made a mistake 
and the imam of the age would eliminate the mistake even before 
the jurisconsult realized. And then when he did realize he 
would inform him that you do your work; you issue your fatwa; 
you perform your duty and we will perform ours. 
  That is why I tell you that, especially in crucial issues, 
if 
it comes to a point where decisionmaking or action requires 
guidance and the person who actually has the responsibility for 
the ummah has a problem in making a decision or it is difficult 
for him or there is a possibility of making a mistake, then the 
imam [of the age] must come to his aid. We believe that during 
the Islamic revolution in Iran the leader of the revolution, the 
departed imam [Khomeyni], may God Almighty be satisfied with 
him, made use of such guidance time and again; especially in 
crucial and dangerous issues where decisionmaking is most 
difficult. I noted in another session that all of the imam's 
friends -- even the members of the Revolution Council who had 
been appointed by the imam -- wrote to him saying that 
conditions are not right; do not come to Iran. The conditions 
are severe and that is not possible. It is not possible to 
foresee what will happen. He replied forthrightly: I will 
definitely come and if I am to be killed, I should be killed 
among my own people. And when he set foot on the Iranian soil 
and when his face was first sighted from the plane -- take 
careful note of that; I note some meticulous observers have been 
most careful [in this] -- a very deep tranquillity could be 
sensed in the imam. Those who are acquainted with psychological 
matters can read a person's mind from his face. With utmost 
calm as if there was no problem. As if he saw that with his 
coming the victory of the revolution was final and there would 
be no problems either. [passage omitted] 
  In my view and in my belief this issue [Khomeyni's decision 
to come to Iran] is a sign of the so-called divine guidance 
[ershadat-e gheybi] by the imam of the age, God's peace be on 
him, to aid and guide his deputy -- the person who has taken on 
the responsibility -- to the extent that he himself [the imam of 
the age] manages affairs according to principles and there will 
not be any problems. If there is to be an issue that will be to 
the detriment of the umma, his imamate requires that he does not 
abandon his ummah and guides his deputy. [passage omitted] 
  His imamate requires that in the vital issues concerning 
the ummah the deputy must be guided even if it means somehow to 
take over his heart, his thoughts, and his brain. The absence 
does not mean severance; that he has sat in a corner and the 
jurisconsults administer. That is not so. Those jurisconsults 
who take the responsibility of managing are under special 
conditions where they must, so to speak, have that privilege. 
  I have very little time. Nevertheless there are several 
issues that I must tell you, so I'll try to be very concise. 
Let me say something in this same regard. 
  During the absence [of the imam of the age] grand 
jurisconsults became the imam's general deputy and manage the 
ummah. The deputization was given by title; that is the title 
of jurisconsult. And at any time the titles are many and can be 
many. There are jurisconsults. In our time there are many 
jurisconsults and those titles and conditions are true in their 
case. In al-Najaf, in Qom, in Mashhad, in various cities where 
Shiites are present. [passage omitted on history of imamate] 
  Eventually, thanks be to God, all those skirmishes and 
confrontations by jurisconsults and deputies of the 12th Imam 
with the governments came to fruition in our time with the hands 
of the departed imam [Khomeyni] and in reality a government in 
the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded in the name 
of the imam [of the age]]. [passage omitted] 
  When the Islamic government was founded it meant that during 
more than 1,000 years of confrontation with rulers infidelity 
vanished and Islam came. It was not like a dynasty vanishing 
and another dynasty appearing. That is most important. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran means infidelity vanished in 
the 
government and Islam replaced it. The jurisconsult who has the 
responsibility of sovereignty of Islam is a theologian, a deputy 
of the imam [of the age] and acts according to Islam and must 
observe all the Islamic conditions. He himself is subject to 
Islamic laws and regulations. It is Islam that rules, not the 
individual. Under such circumstances I have a question: If 
during 1,000 years our jurisconsults, our religious scholars 
throughout the Islamic cities used to answer the people's 
religious problems, used to receive the religious tax and spent 
it on religious matters, act in areas that they were allowed to 
act and would say they had no duty in the areas were they could 
not act, and the tyrant rulers used to act at the time of the 
sovereignty of Islam, a jurisconsult somewhere cannot set 
himself up as a judge. [as received] He cannot say that there 
is a judicial system in the Islamic Republic and someone has 
been appointed as its head by the leader and they are 
administering the judicial system, but I am a religious scholar 
and wish to set up a judicial system in Shiraz [capital of Fars 
Province]; I can get involved in matters of jihad and war and 
peace; get involved in collecting tax. 
  My insistence that the conditions before and after the 
establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran have changed and 
differ is for this point. If today grand jurisconsults are 
sources of emulation and issue fatwas, nothing is wrong with 
that. Let them issue fatwas: A particular prayer must be said 
once or three times. That is not crucial, let them issue 
fatwas. What is wrong with that? [passage omitted] 
  But if under the conditions of sovereignty of Islam a 
jurisconsult -- for example in a corner of say this Islamic 
state of Iran -- should say, after the leadership has announced 
that there should not be any ties with such and such country, 
that: he is a jurisconsult and I am a jurisconsult. He is 
talking nonsense when he says there should be no ties! I say 
there should be! The leadership says war must be waged. He 
says: no it should not. The leadership says the government can 
set a tax. The jurisconsult says no it cannot. [passage 
omitted] 
  What will be the result? Will not the result be for Islam to 
vanish and infidelity to come and rule once again? The question 
is one of government, and not one of nongovernmental issue. The 
multiplicity of sources of emulation and grand jurisconsults 
poses no problems for the community. During the life of the 
imam [Khomeyni], also, there were many jurisconsults. Not only 
did none of them interfere in government affairs, but they gave 
support to the government. They used to say that whatever the 
imam says we accept. They either did not interfere in 
government affairs, or they offered support. [passage omitted] 
  I say that the multiplicity of grand jurisconsults for 
sources of emulation is no problem. But multiple sources of 
emulation who seek to somehow confront the leadership, interfere 
in government affairs, involve their fatwas in government 
affairs and undermine the government means once again separating 
politics from religion and a return to some people issuing 
fatwas somewhere and the people acting on their fatwas while 
others are ruling somewhere else according to worldy matters. 
All the 1,000-year troubles of the great religious scholars and 
grand jurisconsults which came to fruition by the hands of the 
departed imam will be destroyed again. I say this must be 
carefully looked into. 
  That is why I say that those jurisconsults who are presented 
as sources of emulation must be aware of the times. They must 
respond to the realities existing in the community. They must 
recognize the friends and foes of the Islamic ummah. They must 
distinguish the plots that the enemies of Islam hatch for Islam 
and the Muslims. That is why the departed imam easily and 
frankly said says that if a jurisconsult does not know the 
issues of the time and is incapable of distinguishing them in 
his view he fails to be a jurisconsult. [passage omitted] 
  That is why when I claim that a lofty jurisconsult, an 
exalted jurisconsult, an administering and adroit jurisconsult, 
a jurisconsult who is aware of today's world of Islam and has 
adequate and complete experience, that is, the exalted leader, 
His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, is at the very least, of the 
same rank as others who are being considered. Of course this 
debate belongs to follow the Grand Ayatollah Araki [chosen to 
replace Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani as a source of emulation], 
may God Almighty preserve him. When I make a claim, this is the 
point I base my claim on. That is, the issue must be judged in 
its totality. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "ABRAR To Join International Media </F>
Network"] 
  [Text] As a result of efforts by the Ministry of Post, 
Telegraph, and Telephones, a general information network will be 
inaugurated in our country during the Ten Days of Dawn [1-10 
February] celebrations. 
  Subscribers to this network will be able to connect to it 
from anywhere inside the country and from abroad by dialing a 
number. 
  Initially, newspaper reports, information on train and 
flight 
schedules, and a telephone directory will be entered in the 
database. 
  The ABRAR newspaper will soon join this network. An informed 
source in the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephones told 
our correspondent that once this network is operational, 
subscribers will be able to obtain their required information 
within seconds. 
  For example, if a subscriber on the other side of the world 
requires a particular newspaper, he can contact the network and 
obtain the required information within seconds. 
  One of the evening newspapers that is scheduled to join the 
network will be disseminated simultaneously in Tehran and in a 
European country. The informed source said most of the Western 
and some Asian countries have such networks. 
  As for the costs of subscribing to this network, he said 
they 
would be announced later but that they would in any case be low 
and result in a savings of time. 
  The network center will be located in the Shahed 
telecommunications complex, which is at the end of the Kordestan 
Autobahn. 
<H5>  Technical Information </H5>
  IRANPAC: This is a general information network being planned 
for communications among computers and terminals in the country 
and with other networks in the world. The IRANPAC packet 
switching network will be capable of providing reliable, 
precise, effective, and economical connections among the 
information centers. 
<H5>  Different Transmission Speeds </H5>
  By using Random Access Memory processes in the network and 
logical channels, IRANPAC will be capable of a simultaneous 
two-way exchange of information between two subscribers at 
different speeds. 
  How do we gain access to IRANPAC? 
  The following measures should be taken to gain access to 
IRANPAC: 
  Set up a communications line between the network center and 
the subscriber's DTE [Data Terminal Equipment] to obtain data by 
the following means: 
  1. [no subsequent numbers below as published] Private 
communications: The subscriber is linked through a permanent 
line to the nearest packet switching network center via the 
IRANPAC network so that he can be linked to the network without 
any loss of time whenever he likes. Under this arrangement, the 
asynchronous DTE speed of his private line can be 300-1,200 bits 
per second and the synchronous DTE speed can be 4,800-9,600 bits 
per second. 
  To gain access by dialing: Under this method, the subscriber 
uses a preassigned telephone number and calls from any of the 
ports in the network that are closest to the IRANPAC switching 
center and offered to the subscribers. 
  The subscribers can in this manner obtain a Network User 
Identification so that when they call up the IRANPAC network, 
their identification is verified; if they are bona fide 
subscribers, they are connected to the desired address. The 
speed in this case is 1,300 or 1,200-2,400 bits per second.

people's bureaus abroad should be regulated. 

    3. The General People's Committee for Foreign 
Liaison and International Cooperation should continue its 
efforts with international and regional organizations in order 
to explain the Jamahiriyah's causes at their meetings and 
assemblies. 
  4. The necessary service should be provided to all Libyan 
Arabs abroad and particular attention should be paid to those 
who are there to study or to obtain medical treatment. 
  5. The Jamahiriyah's financial obligation to all 
international organizations should be settled. 
  6. The Jamahiriyah should deal with foreign countries in 
accordance with their stances and implement the principle of 
reciprocity. 
  7. The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and 
International Cooperation should be bolstered in order to allow 
it to shoulder its duties. 
  8. All imperialist schemes which are aiming at 
controlling the world should be confronted. 
  9. The BPC's assert the need to implement their previous 
decisions on the necessity of collecting debts owed by foreign 
countries; of seeking reparations for damages suffered by the 
Libyan Arab people during the Italian occupation; and of finding 
out the fate of Libyans who were deported to the Italian islands 
[in the 1920's]. 
  10. Cognizance should be taken of the observations made 
in the report of the General People's Committee for Control and 
Popular Follow-up. 
  11. The people's bureaus abroad should be compelled to 
meet their budget deadlines. 
  12. The Ouzou issue should be followed up at the 
International Court of Justice. 
  13. The BPC's express appreciation for the stances taken 
by international, regional, and popular organizations which 
stood by the side of the Great Jamahiriyah in its confrontation 
with the fabricated campaign by imperialist powers. 
  14. Control over the people's bureaus' decision to 
furnish visas for foreigners should be tightened. 
  15. The BPC's see a need to create political, economic, 
and cultural ties with the rest of the world in a beneficial 
manner and to explain the Jamahiriyah's policies. 
  16. There should be coordination between the General 
People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Cooperation and syndicates and unions when it comes to foreign 
relations. 
  17. Muslim peoples and people of the Third World should 
be supported and relations with them in all spheres bolstered, 
in line with the common struggle against imperialism and 
international Zionism. 
  Fourth: The report of the General People's Committee for 
Unity. 
  The BPC's examined the report of the General People's 
Committee for Unity and decided the following: 
  1. The leading role being played by the brother leader of 
the revolution to realize Arab unity should be stressed. 
  2. More efforts should be exerted to bring the date of 
Arab unity nearer, to focus upon the Arab Maghreb Union, to 
implement agreements signed in this respect, and to continue 
contacts with other Arab unionist bodies in order to clear the 
atmosphere and resolve current dispute. 
  3. Difficulties should be overcome and customs duties 
facilitated between the Jamahiriyah, Egypt, Sudan, and the Arab 
Maghreb Union. 
  4. Relations with other Arab countries should be reviewed 
in accordance with stances taken by the latter regarding the 
mandatory sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council against 
Jamahiriyah. 
  5. Efforts should be made to work seriously toward the 
creation of a strong Arab economy, investing money in order to 
bring about more economic projects in the Arab homeland and set 
up an Arab common market. 
  6. The General People's Committee for Unity should be 
bolstered with necessary human and material resources in order 
to allow it to play its full role in urging comprehensive Arab 
unity. 
  7. The committee should be consolidated in such a way as 
to allow it to implement the decisions of the BPC's. 
  8. The brotherhood bureaus should be bolstered and it 
should be ensured that their employees are fully competent to 
fulfil their duties; help should be given to enable those 
elected by the BPC's to be recruited to them. 
  9. Attention should be paid to cultural centers in the 
Arab homeland and they should be supported with able and 
committed elements. 
  10. Agreements and treaties between the Jamahiriyah and 
other countries should be ratified. 
  The BPC's examined agreements and treaties between the great 
Jamahiriyah and foreign countries during 1992-93; they ratified 
them but made the following observations: 
  1. The implementation of agreed agreements with foreign 
countries should be continued and reports filed about the 
progress of their implementation for the attention of the BPC's. 
  2. The customs tariffs which Libyans and Libyan products 
have been facing should be lifted, otherwise reciprocal measures 
will be taken against the rest of the Arab countries. 
  3. There should be written guarantees for the Libyans' 
investment abroad, particularly in Egypt, Sudan, and Chad. 
  That was the last resolution of the fourth article on 
foreign 
policy. Thank you. 
  Fifth: The budgets. 
  I. Regarding the follow-up of the implementation of the 
general budget for 1992-93, the BPC's discussed the memorandum 
on the follow-up of the implementation of the general budget for 
the financial year 1992-93. They expressed their satisfaction 
and decided the following: 
  1. The sum which was spent in excess of the budget should be 
approved. 
  2. The three-year program should stress the 
implementation of the equipment projects which were not 
implemented during the past annual equipment programs; special 
attention should be given to the remote areas. 
  3. Salaries should be paid on time in future. 
  4. Tax and duty collecting and revenue gathering 
departments should carry out their duties fully. 
  5. The monies required within the framework of the 
three-year program should be made available in order to meet 
payment for the projects already contracted, especially the 
production and infrastructure projects. 
  6. The observations of the General People's Committee for 
Control and Follow-up should be taken into account. 
  II. Regarding the preparation of the 1994 general budget, 
the 
BPC's discussed the memorandum relating to the 1994 general 
budget and decided to adopt it and to give permission for the 
drafting of the Law on the General Budget for the Financial Year 
1994 in accordance with the contents of the memorandum, taking 
the following into account: 
  1. To keep free education for Libyan citizens. 
  2. To give priority at time of implementation to the 
payment of salaries. 
  3. Not to place any additional financial burdens on 
salaried and wage-earning citizens with limited income. 
  4. To take into consideration the monies earmarked for 
secretariats of the BPC's. 
  5. To do away with foreign labor in administrative posts 
and to gradually reduce the number of foreign employees working 
in the administrative apparatus. 
  6. To give strategic projects priority in implementation. 
  7. To take into account the population density and the 
geographical area when distributing allowances. 
  I. The three-year program 1994-96. The BPC's discussed a 
memorandum relating to the three-year program and approved the 
program according to the contents of the memorandum. They 
stressed that the following should be taken into account: 
  1. To work for the completion of the contracted educational 
and health projects. 
  2. To concentrate on the strategic projects of an economic 
nature. 
  3. To take into account balanced regional development when 
approving the locations of projects, and in a manner that will 
not harm the economic worthiness of the production projects. 
  4. To stress that special attention should be devoted to 
remote areas. 
  5. The implementation of the projects shall be done by 
local companies and partnerships whenever possible. 
  6. To stress that attention should be given to the 
maintainance of projects which have already been implemented, 
especially investment projects. 
  This is the end of the drafting. [applause] Now we read out 
the resolution of the conferences regarding the clause of 
accountability. This will be read out by the brother secretary 
of BPC affairs: 
  [BPC Affairs Secretary 'Ali al-Sha'iri] In the name of God. 
The resolution of the General People's Congress on 
accountability: 
  In an endeavor to entrench and consolidate accountability as 
part of the jamahiri system and as a means for evaluation, 
effectiveness, and correction of the program of implementing the 
resolutions of the BPC's, the General People's Congress in its 
1994 session questioned: 
  First, the General People's Committee and the qualitative 
general people's committees and decided to stress the 
programming and implementation of the directives of the brother 
leader of the revolution and enlist them within the plans and 
programs of action of the General People's Committee and the 
qualitative general people's committees and to issue detailed 
resolutions on implementing them. 
  Second, the congress decided to implement the resolutions of 
the BPC's which have not been seriously implemented, by way of 
the implementation action movement of the General People's 
Committee and the qualitative general people's committees during 
the coming phase, to follow up the stages of their 
implementation, and to overcome any difficulties that may 
confront them. 
  Third, the congress decided to speed up the treatment of the 
points of accountability raised by the BPC's and to consider 
that as being among the priorities of action at the meetings of 
the General People's Committee and the qualitative general 
people's committees, and to send reports on this to the BPC's. 
  Fourth, the congress decided to charge the qualitative 
general people's committees with the task of making 
extraordinary and concentrated efforts to deal with and respond 
to the repeated remarks made by the General People's Committee 
for Control and People's Follow-up in its reports during the 
past years. 
  Fifth: The congress decided to work for the reorganization 
of 
the companies owned by the society and to deal with the 
bottlenecks and material, technical, and procedural difficulties 
which these companies face, so that these companies can perform 
their roles and consolidate their effectiveness in economic and 
social devlopment. 
  The General People's Congress Secretariat decided the 
following: 
  First: To take interest in the secretariats of the BPC's to 
enable them to perform their roles as they should, and to deal 
with some of the necessities such as making avilable the 
premises, furniture, and stationery they require. 
  Second: To hold continuous regular meetings with the 
secretaries of the BPC's so that they can perform the tasks they 
are entrusted with. 
  Third: To deal as much as possible with making available to 
the BPC secretariats the clauses of the agendas in sufficient 
time prior to the convening of the conferences. 
  Fourth: To submit for discussion at the meetings with the 
Secretariat of the General People's Committee some of the topics 
raised by the BPC secretariats. 
  The General People's Committee for Control and People's 
Follow-up decided the following: 
  To direct the General People's Committee for Control and 
People's Follow-up to double its control effort and to 
extensively and more seriously realize the concept of detailed 
follow-up. This is the end of Accountability. [applause]

<F P=106> [Statement by Salimah Rashid, assistant secretary for </F>
women's affairs, at the General People's Congress in Surt -- 
live] 
  [Text] The General People's Congress [GPC] -- the meeting 
of the people's congresses, the people's committees, union, 
syndicates, and professional associations -- that is being 
convened in the town of Surt in the period 10th to the 17th 
Sha'ban since the death of the Prophet, corresponding to 22-29 
January 1994, stresses the attachment of the Libyan Arab people 
to its right to the legitimate defense of its freedom, honor, 
choices, and respect for its sovereignty and laws in accordance 
with the UN Charter, and it stresses its commitment to 
international charters and the bases that govern relations 
between states, all of which confirm that disputes should be 
solved by peaceful means, negotiations, dialogue, and discarding 
the methods of use of force or the threat to use force. 
  It rejects the serious trend to which some Western powers 
have been pursuing, in the coercive use of some of the 
provisions of the UN Charter and involving the Security Council, 
in an issue that is not of its concern. 
  The Libyan Arab people feel the persecution that has been 
meted on it by Europe and America, a persecution that has 
historical roots. The campaigns of the crusaders, the Normans, 
the Spaniards, the Vandals, and other successive campaigns 
followed by the tyrant Italian colonialism. Those campaigns 
resulted in thousands of victims, kidnapped and banished people. 
  While the General People's Congress -- the meeting of the 
people's congresses, people's committees, unions, syndicates, 
and professional associations -- mentions this, it recalls with 
pain the U.S. aggression, the raids it carried out, and the 
victims it made among children, women, and old people during a 
tyrannical, unjust, and unjustified aggression, in addition to 
harming the integrity of the Libyan Arab soil and its 
territorial waters, and shooting down aircraft and sinking 
ships, as well as criminally kidnapping Libyan Arab nationals 
who were imprisoned in Chad. The United States is directly 
responsible for those who were killed, wounded, and those who 
deviated or were misled. 
  The Libyan Arab people were expecting apologies from Europe 
because of their unjust campaigns against it, especially Italy, 
to expiate its crimes during its occupation of the Libyan Arab 
lands. 
  The Libyan Arab people were expecting the United States to 
apologize for its air raid, aggressions, and violations of the 
Libyan Arab waters. However, the Libyan Arab people were 
surprised at the deliberate persistence in pursuing its 
oppression instead of receiving an apology. This entrenched the 
feeling of being oppressed among the masses of this steadfast 
people. This feeling of oppression was exacerbated by the 
tangible effects and sufferings due to the embargo and siege [as 
heard] resolutions, and the sanctions unjustly imposed on it, 
thus causing the death of hundreds of people and the loss of 
billions in revenue. All this is aimed at having the sons [the 
two Lockerbie suspects] of the Libyan Arab people handed over, 
to treat its sovereignty and laws with disdain, without any 
consideration for international laws and conventions. 
  While the GPC stresses the spontaneous mass rallying of the 
Libyan Arab people around its leader in huge and unprecedented 
popular gatherings, and its strong commitment to the principles 
of the great al-Fatih [1 September] revolution and its eternal 
human objectives that call for stressing human rights, it 
stresses the fact that the masses of the Libyan Arab people have 
become fully convinced that the governments of the Western 
countries have obstructed all efforts aimed at reaching a 
solution to the crisis and arriving at the truth, despite the 
fact that the Great Socialist People's Arab Libyan Republic has 
taken enough measures and decisions to implement Security 
Council Resolution No. 731. This was given a positive response 
and welcomed within the Security Council itself that barred the 
way before the intransigent stances of the three Western 
countries [France, the United States, and Britain] and their 
deliberate disregard of this positive response. 
  While it has followed with great anxiety the escalation of 
the unjust mandatory sanctions against the Libyan Arab people, 
and while it recalls its previous resolutions and statements on 
this issue, the GPC stresses once more that the Great 
Jamahiriyah will not spare any efforts or means to affirm its 
eagerness for the implementation of justice and to abide by 
international law, in the framework of dialogue and 
understanding, far removed from the language of threat. 
  The Great Jamahiriyah was expecting that its initiative 
would 
find the response of the concerned parties. However, the 
governments of the three Western states have continued in the 
language of threat and provocation in a way that does not serve 
international peace and security, and does not respect 
international principles and conventions and states' 
sovereignty, and does not enable one to reach peaceful solutions 
that are satisfactory to all parties. This was called for by 
all international and regional organizations, particularly the 
Arab League, the OAU, ICO [Islamic Conference Organization], the 
AMU [Arab Maghreb Union], the nonaligned countries, parties, 
popular organizations, and unions of the world. All these have 
stressed their consideration for the stance of the Great 
Jamahiriyah and the initiatives it has put forward in order to 
solve the crisis peacefully. 
  While it expresses its deep regret for and indignation at 
the UN Security Council's submission to the pressures of the 
three Western states -- who have adopted the method of force, 
warning, threat, and blockade as the only means in its dealings 
with the Great Jamahiriyah, aimed at making this conflict last 
longer in order to cause the biggest damages to the Libyan Arab 
people and at achieving other aims that have no relation with 
the issue of the dispute -- the GPC clearly highlights the use 
of a double-standard policy when implementing international 
resolutions. 
  The GPC has decided to send Libyan Arab delegations to 
various world states in order to explain the dimensions of the 
sequence of aggression against Libya and its continuation for 
centuries, as well as the deep feelings of oppression that 
Libyans have. The GPC draws the attention of the international 
community to what follows: 
  First: The enormity of the damages caused to the Libyan Arab 
people as a result of the implementation of the UN Security 
Council's resolutions that have encompassed all sectors and 
caused the deaths of hundreds of innocents, and these damages 
have also affected neighboring and other states. 
  Second: The seriousness of the state of international 
relations, as this crisis has confirmed, that whenever Britain, 
the United States, and France agreed on some matter, they are 
able to impose it on the international community that bears the 
consequences of material and human losses resulting from this. 
  Third: The seriousness of the stage lived by the peoples of 
the world amidst the international changes with their negative 
effects on the Third World and small states. These changes 
contain within themselves possibilities that are carried through 
under various slogans, the most dangerous of which are what are 
called: land for peace, the elimination of the Palestinian 
issue, and other liberation causes. This constitutes a 
dangerous precedent that is in contradiction of the UN Charter 
and all international principles, laws, and conventions that 
forbid and consider the occupation of others' land by force as a 
crime. 
  A just, comprehensive, and durable solution of the 
Palestinian issue can only be achieved by returning all the 7 
million Palestinian people to their land and the setting up of a 
democratic Palestinian State, in which Palestinians and Jews 
born in Palestine would coexist, ending the state of the Zionist 
entity and removing its mass destruction weapons. 
  The GPC reiterates the Libyan Arab people's faith and 
commitment to the unity of the Arab nation in order that the 
latter will possess the constituents of power and development. 
The GPC stresses the Libyan Arab people's commitment to the 
Arab League Charter and the importance of enforcing and 
developing its role, in order that this will be the instrument 
of Arab joint action and bring nearer the day of comprehensive 
Arab unity. 
  The GPC stresses its condemnation of the violations of the 
Arab League Charter and resolutions, particularly the resolution 
of Arab boycott of Zionist aggression. The GPC stresses that 
the changes in our world today, and the frustration and 
bitterness they cause, are scientific proof of the triumph of 
people's revolution and the green Jamahiri thought at 
international level in response to the downfall, decline, 
injustice, grief, oppression, and tyranny from which mankind 
suffers, as the great al-Fatih revolution has become a new 
reading of history and modern times, and a help not only for the 
Arab nation alone but for mankind as a whole. 
  By the General People's Congress, on 17 Sha'ban 1403 after 
the Prophet's demise, corresponding to 29 January 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kamal al-Sa'id Habib, "one of the founders </F>
of the Al-Jihad Organization," by unidentified AL-SAFIR reporter 
in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [AL-SAFIR] Some reports say 
al-Jihad and the Islamic Group might merge. How true is this? 
Were there unification attempts in the past? Why did they fail? 
  [Habib] Al-Jihad will remain al-Jihad, and the Islamic Group 
will remain the Islamic Group. Unification has not been 
proposed because there are major differences in our methods of 
action. Undoubtedly, the Islamic Group is now more prominent 
than al-Jihad, but this is because the two organizations have 
different views. While al-Jihad believes in comprehensive 
change, the Islamic Group believes in the promotion of virtue 
and the suppression of vice. The small operations that gave the 
Islamic Group prominence are part of the group's method of 
action. Al-Jihad, on the other hand, believes in comprehensive 
change as the basis of its movement. Therefore, al-Jihad is now 
weaker than it was in 1981. It lacks organizational foundations 
and has no unified leadership. In addition, it received many 
blows since the assassination of President al-Sadat in 1981. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Do you believe rumors that there is a split in 
al-Jihad between Ayman al-Zawahiri and Colonel Makkawi? 
  [Habib] Colonel Makkawi's story is really strange. I think 
there is an attempt by the media to highlight some names and 
suggest there is a split in the organization. At any rate, 
Ayman al- Zawahiri, Colonel Makkawi, or others represent only 
themselves or small groups within al-Jihad; they do not 
represent the al-Jihad Organization. Within al-Jihad, there are 
many schools of thought that take independent actions; it is 
known that al-Jihad groups work independently. Therefore, I 
believe that the groups representing al-Jihad are too varied to 
be incorporated into one organization. I stress that there is 
no organization for al-Jihad in the full sense of the word; 
there are groups that believe in the general thought but express 
themselves with different mechanisms. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-SAFIR] Is daily violence in the Egyptian streets a way 
to 
achieve power? Does al-Jihad believe that violence is needed at 
this particular stage? 
  [Habib] Violence and clashes with the state will not produce 
positive results; indeed, they will not serve the Islamic 
movement in general. It is better to open up society and try to 
establish the Islamic presence inside its normal structure. The 
strategic outlook should be given precedence over this "din," 
which will not lead to necessary changes. In short, the current 
violence does not benefit al-Jihad or the Islamic movement in 
general. Those in the Islamic movement who practice violence 
are a sector that has been forced by the state to do so. They 
feel their lives are threatened at any moment by military 
courts, even when they live abroad. Therefore, they are 
practicing violence irrespective of its results. We must stress 
that, historically, it was the state that started violence 
against the Islamic groups and counterviolence was thus 
imperative. In addition, the absence of the Islamic shari'ah 
forces Muslims to demand its implementation, even through 
violence. 
  [AL-SAFIR] After each operation, people wonder what the 
Islamists really want. We are posing this question to you. 
  [Habib] It should not be taken for granted that the 
Islamists 
are the ones who are carrying out these operations. Egyptian 
society has been infiltrated and the perpetrators could be the 
Mosad, some armed Christian organizations, or even the state 
itself. We do not want to assume that the Islamists are 
terrorists. Although there are some groups deviating from the 
general course, such as al-Shawqiyun and others, al-Jihad has a 
clear cultural mission. I, therefore, rule out the possibility 
of al-Jihad carrying out such operations. We hope the state 
will implement the Islamic shari'ah so that people can rest. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-SAFIR] The government is now calling for national 
dialogue. How do you view this dialogue, knowing that the 
Islamic groups, especially al-Jihad, are not participating? 
  [Habib] The government's call is not serious. I believe the 
president made the call without realizing that there are other 
forces stronger than him. Concerning the mechanism of 
implementation, the call for the dialogue is not serious. If it 
was, then all political forces would have been invited. I think 
al- Jihad and the Islamic Group have conditions for joining the 
dialogue. These include releasing detainees, refraining from 
intervening in Islamic preaching in mosques, and refraining from 
desecrating sanctities. These are simple and legitimate 
demands. Dialogue is needed to end Egypt's crisis, but dialogue 
in its old form is fruitless. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-SAFIR] Where are the political Islam groups heading? 
  [Habib] Those groups need to revise their mechanisms and 
plans to link them to reality. I believe violence will not 
produce results. It will not serve the Islamic movement and 
will not decide the issue. All of society needs a change and 
the outlook toward change must be comprehensive. Islam in Egypt 
will inevitably remain, and when the Islamists reach power there 
will be no struggle among them, as there is in Afghanistan.

<F P=106> [Report by Nahum Barne'a] </F>
  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said last night in 
a meeting with writers and poets at his home, that he can depend 
more on President al-Asad's word than Yasir 'Arafat's. 
  "'Arafat is under pressure from all sides. He says something 
and then two weeks later cannot deliver what he promises. He 
does not represent all the Palestinians. Still, he is our only 
partner on the Palestinian side and the negotiations with him 
will continue. There is no going back." [passage omitted] 
  Rabin said he reached the conclusion that al-Asad is serious 
about his contacts with Israel when Israeli intelligence learned 
that al-Asad had turned down a request by the Iranian ambassador 
to meet with him prior to the Syrian leader's summit meeting 
with Clinton in Geneva. Rabin reached the conclusion that Syria 
has a partnership with Iran on the Iraqi issue, but that it 
decided to sever the partnership in relation to Israel. 
  "If al-Asad were to do one-third of what al-Sadat did, there 
would be no problems in the peace process with Syria," Rabin 
said. [passage omitted] 
  Rabin also said that because of the danger of Iran and 
Islamic fundamentalism, peace must be reached between Israel and 
all the pro-American states in the region. "I hope that al-Asad 
now understands that the path to rapprochement with the U.S. 
must go through Israel." 
  He spoke with concern about the regime in Egypt. "The regime 
in Syria is more stable than the one in Egypt. Even if al-Asad 
is assassinated the regime will remain stable. On the other 
hand, the regime in Egypt is now the least stable in the region 
and is under the risk of an Islamic takeover." 
  The meeting lasted over three hours and was held in a 
pleasant atmosphere and with a lot of empathy displayed for the 
prime minister.

  [Text] After beginning a fight doomed to failure, the 
Karmal-Dostom militia has suffered great loss of life. 
According to reports obtained from surgical hospitals, which 
treat war casualties, 1,000 individuals from Dostum's militia 
have been injured so far and sent to those hospitals. The 
report adds: During the second offensive alone, which took place 
in the area between Mirorayon and Pacha Pol, as a result of the 
counteroffensive of the Islamic army and mujaheddin, 300 of them 
were injured. Reports say that it can be concluded that during 
the one month of Karmal-Dostom's failure in fighting more than 
1,000 people were killed and even more were injured. This 
number is very large, and it is a fact that enemy's combat 
morale has been sufficiently crushed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Big Brother And India"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's latest statement on 
Punjab betray contempt towards this country. This statement of 
U.S. interference cannot be accepted. The U.S. President, in 
reply to Congressman Gary A. Condit and 15 other legislators, 
demanding an active U.S. diplomatic role in Punjab, has assured 
them that his administration shares their "desire for a peaceful 
solution that protects Sikh rights" and promised to take up the 
issue with authorities in New Delhi. There should be no doubt, 
however, that what is being cleverly camouflaged as defence of 
human rights is in fact a brazen interference on the part of the 
Clinton administration in India's internal affairs. Indeed, 
contrary to a widespread illusion among New Delhi's policy 
makers that Washington under a Democratic Party president would 
hold India in a tight embrace, Mr. Clinton has lost no 
opportunity to bare his fangs at this country. In fact, there 
has not been a single issue in the past year which has revealed 
that Mr. Clinton's set-up has the slightest consideration or 
respect for India's autonomy. Instead what has been flaunted as 
the administration's fresh "even handed" approach towards the 
subcontinent has essentially meant a definite anti-India, 
pro-Pakistan bias in U.S. policy pronouncements. Little wonder 
then that the U.S. has chosen to treat Pakistani help for 
terrorists in India as being no worse than the propaganda of 
human rights violations in India. The tone for such a lop-sided 
policy was set rather early through the blunt remarks of Mr. 
John Malott, a senior U.S. official who visited Delhi last May 
when he sermonised us on improving our human rights record, 
especially in regard to Kashmir and Punjab. In so doing not 
only did Washington choose to be blind to the "ground realities" 
in both these states, where our forces are fighting a proxy war 
against infiltrators sent by Pakistan, but also totally 
overlooked the constitutional safeguards our democratic polity 
and independent judiciary provide for protection of human 
rights. Mr. Clinton admits "some recent improvements in the 
Sikhs' situations" but maintains that "abuses still occur." 
Perhaps he needs to be reminded that even in this country 
Rodney King episodes do take place. On the question of human 
rights, India would want Washington to keep in mind that it is 
fully conscious of its responsibility to defend human and civic 
rights. It has a human rights commission. These institutions 
may have to be made more effective. But that is India's 
concern. The fact that the U.S. has shown little appreciation 
of India's stand on the issue shows that Mr. Clinton perhaps 
find the human rights issue a clever means of arm-twisting India 
into following policies tailored to suit American interests, 
especially on the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] issue. 
Curiously, Mr. Clinton wrote a similar letter to Dr. Ghulam 
Nabi Fai, head of the pro-terrorism Kashmir-American Council on 
the same day that he wrote to the Congressmen on Punjab. But 
while the former statement to a lobbyist was said to be an 
oversight, his communication to the Congressmen could hardly be 
so. By replying to the Congressmen referring to the crisis of 
"Khalistan", Mr. Clinton may have lent credence to a concept 
which the same Mr. Malott had only last August announced as 
having no official sanction. The Indian government has done 
well to react sternly to Mr. Clinton's statement.

  [Text] Mohammad-Khan, minister for economic affairs and 
finance, in a meeting with a delegation from the World Bank, 
spoke about the significant and fundamental role of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in the region. 
  Mohammad-Khan said: The main indexes obtained during the 
first development plan indicate that the country's economy is 
moving toward an organized and programmed economy -- and taking 
into account the world economic recession, Iran enjoys a 
relatively good growth. 
  Referring to the substitution of imports that will reduce 
future foreign currency requirements, he said: With the 
increase in domestic production, there will be a fall in the 
import of petrochemical goods and foods, as well as commodities 
needed by consumer and intermediate industries while the export 
of nonoil goods will increase. 
  Mohammad-Khan also spoke on the policy of privatization and 
said the government intends to sell factories through auction or 
limited partnership with individuals interested in investment 
and management. 
  The minister for economic affairs and finance also spoke on 
Iran's important role of creating positive prospects for 
neighboring countries' economies, as well as creating provisions 
for transport of goods from Iranian ports.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the meetings of the committee on arms 
control and regional security stemming from the multilateral 
talks, has stated that the Palestinian party is still opposed to 
and has reservations on the proposed joint paper that is being 
discussed by the subcommittee because it contains certain 
political issues that should not be discussed by the arms 
control committee. In a statement to MENA today on the 
sidelines of the committee meeting, he said that the paper still 
contains numerous political items that are the jurisdiction of 
the bilateral negotiations, which are considered to be the basis 
of the political process. He noted that the paper that will be 
adopted at the conclusion of the meetings in Cairo will not be 
"a recommendation" but a "draft" that will be submitted to the 
Arab countries to give their official view. It will then be put 
forward to the general arms control committee meeting scheduled 
for April. 
  Meanwhile, an official source in the United Arab Emirates 
delegation participating in the meetings of the arms control and 
regional security committee said that the United States and 
Russia, in their capacity as cosponsors of the peace conference 
should endorse on any joint principles adopted by the current 
meetings in Cairo and not just take a neutral stand. In a 
statement to MENA, he said that his country insists on the two 
cosponsors' approval and endorsement of any formula on 
principles reached by the Middle East countries so that both 
countries will be committed to that formula in the future. He 
said that this point is still under discussion because both 
cosponsors favor a neutral stance on the position the conferees 
intend to adopt.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--An Arab diplomatic source has 
said that the committee on arms control and regional security, 
emanating from the multilateral talks on peace in the Middle 
East and now meeting in Cairo, has not yet reached an agreement 
on arms control because the Israelis are expressing reservations 
at conducting a detailed discussion of the subject. 
  The source told MENA today that the Israelis are mainly 
concentrating on the first part--arrangements for regional 
security with a view toward breaking the Arab wall around Israel. 
  The source said the Israeli delegation wants to finish 
promptly with security arrangements, as this would mean an 
implicit recognition of Israel by the region's states, while it 
refrains from entering into a detailed discussion of arms 
control. 
  It should be noted that the prevailing view among the 
delegates is that the two subjects must be discussed together 
without focussing on one to the exclusion of the other.

Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has stated that Israel's building of a 
new settlement on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem further 
violates international legitimacy and challenges the 
international community's will. 
  In a message to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
on the issue, 'Abd-al-Majid denounced the Israeli measures, 
which constitute a major obstacle to the peace process. 
  He asked the United Nations to play its moral and legal role 
in taking care of nations under occupation, including the 
Palestinian people. The Arab League secretary general stressed 
that Dr. Butrus-Ghali's efforts in this regard will have the 
greatest effect on Arab and world public opinion. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid also sent a message to Rawhi al-Khatib, 
the 
Arab mayor of Jerusalem who was deported after 1967 and who 
resides in Amman, explaining the Arab League's efforts and 
contacts on the issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Feb 2 (AFP)--Two more Omani banks are 
planning to merge to benefit from attractive incentives offered 
by the Central Bank to encourage mergers as part of overall 
economic reforms in the oil-rich Gulf state. 
  The Oman Arab Bank (OAB) and the Oman-European Bank (OEB) 
have been involved in negotiations for merger, which will be the 
third in Oman since the Central Bank announced the incentives 
three years ago, bankers said on Wednesday [2 February]. 
  "We are holding negotiations but they are still in their 
initial stages," OAB general manager, 'Abd-al Qadir 'Asqalan, 
told AFP by telephone from Muscat. 
  "The capitals of both banks already meet the requirements 
set 
by the Central Bank but the merger is in line with the 
government policy to cut the number of banks and strengthen the 
banking sector." 
  Oman had 11 national banks and 12 foreign units before 
mergers were launched and the Central Bank issued instructions 
for raising their capital to at least 10 million Omani riyals 
(26 million dollars). 
  The first mergers involved the Bank of Muscat with Al-Ahli 
Bank and the Oman Commercial Bank with the Omani Al-Masraf 
institutions. All of them merged to ensure their capital meet 
Central Bank requirements and to raise their adequacy in line 
with guidelines by the Bank for International Settlement [BIS]. 
  Central Bank incentives for merging banks include a deposit 
of 10 million riyals (26 million dollars) for 10 years with an 
interest rate of three percent and exemption of taxes on 
profits for five years. 
  Officials have said they wanted to halve the number of banks 
on the grounds the local market is relatively small. 
  "Mergers will strengthen the banking sector as they will 
boost the financial position of banks and cut competition in the 
local market," said Mansur al-Zakwani, banking chief at the 
Omani Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "This will also enable 
banks to face foreign competition." 
  'Asqalan, whose bank is owned by the Jordanian Arab Bank and 
the Omani International Company for Development and Investment, 
said merging with OEB could give birth to a bank with a capital 
of 20 million riyals (52 million dollars) as the two have a 
capital of 26 million dollars each. 
  "We do not want to talk about the situation now as we have 
not yet entered into details. But we might raise the capital 
later," he said. 
  Other Gulf states are urging their banks to merge or raise 
their capital to strengthen their financial position and meet 
the eight-percent level set by BIS as a floor for capital 
adequacy, the ratio between shareholders equity and assets. The 
BIS move, which took effect in January, is intended to ensure 
banks worldwide have enough funds to face a financial crisis. 
  Most of them have reported positive results of their 
measures, which included stronger intervention in banks, regular 
inspection of their balance sheets and incentives to merging 
units. In the United Arab Emirates, officials said the adequacy 
of the country's 47 banks had exceeded 10 percent. 
  The banking measures in Oman run parallel with large-scale 
reforms to revive the economy and lessen reliance on unstable 
oil earnings. 
  The reforms include privatisations, freeing interest rates 
on 
loans, new incentives to investors, opening up the stock market, 
and upgrading the infrastructure to attract foreign capital.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Jerome </F>
Cochlaine in Geneva on 2 February; published "by special 
arrangement with WNL," acronym not further expanded] 
  [Text] [Cochlaine] You have ended several days of talks 
with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and it seems that 
final agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho is now 
imminent. Can you explain to us the progress that has been 
achieved so far? 
  ['Arafat] True, we have almost reached a final agreement 
during my meeting with Mr. Peres in Davos and we are very close 
to signing an agreement which can be called the Davos agreement. 
The Israelis, however, need a few more days before ratifying 
the agreement. I will meet again with Mr. Peres and [Israeli 
Prime Minister] Mr. Rabin in Cairo. 
  [Cochlaine] What about control over the border crossing 
points with Jordan and access to the Dead Sea? 
  ['Arafat] We discussed these topics at length and we are now 
discussing the details. I cannot say anything further at this 
point. 
  [Cochlaine] You made concessions, for instance, over the 
size of the self-rule area around Jericho--from 340 square km to 
55 square km. Are you willing to make further concessions? 
  ['Arafat] I reject the term "concessions" because the 
achievement of peace is more important than anything else. That 
is why I speak about "the peace of the brave." We will 
implement everything that was agreed upon with the Israelis. 
Similar negotiations were held between Algeria and France in 
the early 1960's and between South Africa's President Frederick 
de Klerk and my friend, Nelson Mandela. 
  [Cochlaine] Do you think the Israelis will withdraw from 
Gaza and Jericho on 13 April as agreed in the timetable of the 
peace agreement that was signed in 13 September 1993? 
  ['Arafat] I hope the Israelis will respect the agreement and 
redeploy their forces in the territories according to plan. 
  [Cochlaine] Will there be elections in July? 
  ['Arafat] I hope the Israelis will not postpone them. Rabin 
had stated that there are no sacred dates, but our position is 
that the agreements which were signed must be respected and 
implemented. 
  [Cochlaine] What role will the elected council play in 
comparison with that of the Palestinian National Authority? 
Will there be two government agencies competing with each other? 
  ['Arafat] The Palestinian National Authority is a permanent 
body that was set up by a Palestine National Council [PNC] 
resolution in 1974, while the council will be convened for 
legislative elections. 
  [Cochlaine] Does that mean that the council will comprise 
PNC members living in the occupied territories? 
  ['Arafat] Certainly. 
  [Cochlaine] Late last year, a delegation of 118 PLO members 
came to Tunis and handed you a letter, criticizing the PLO's 
undemocratic practices and your single-handedness. What is your 
comment on this? 
  ['Arafat] The mere fact that these people were allowed to 
level these accusations and criticisms shows that the PLO is a 
democratic institution. Would they cling to democracy in any 
other organization? We are proud of the fact that we have 
established democracy within the PLO, even when our struggle was 
in full swing. This accomplishment is unprecedented. 
  [Cochlaine] Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad met in 
Geneva on 16 January. Do you believe that Israel can conduct 
peace negotiations on two tracks; that is, with you and with the 
Syrians, at the same time? 
  ['Arafat] Why not? Israel headed for the Madrid and 
Washington negotiations, fully aware that there is no 
alternative to a peace agreement between the Arabs and Israelis 
in the Middle East. The negotiations on both tracks are heading 
in the same direction. At any rate, the PLO's ties with Syria 
are good. Only 10 days ago, I took part in the funeral of 
Basil, President Hafiz al-Asad's eldest son, who died in a 
tragic incident. I also keep in mind the Arab meetings held in 
Washington, which will bring us closer to Arab unity. 
  [Cochlaine] You have recently met with King Fahd in Saudi 
Arabia. You have described your meeting with the Saudi monarch 
as cordial. Is that all there is to this meeting? 
  ['Arafat] Our talks were cordial and constructive. I am 
grateful to King Fahd for the efforts he has made to achieve 
peace in the Middle East. I am also grateful to him for the 
support he is extending to the Palestinian people, the Palestine 
question, and Arab Jerusalem. 
  [Cochlaine] What role do you envisage for Switzerland as a 
mediator in the Middle East conflict? 
  ['Arafat] We appreciate the constructive role being 
undertaken by Switzerland, which is maintaining good relations 
with the Palestinians and Israelis alike, with the Arabs in 
general, with the United States, with Russia, and with the 
Western European Union. Although Norway was active in the Middle 
East peace negotiations last year, the Swiss Confederation has 
always played a distinctive role in Middle East affairs. 
  [Cochlaine] Do you think that you can benefit from the 
so-called Swiss model with regard to political cooperation once 
federal ties are established between Jordan and the Palestinians? 
  ['Arafat] You cannot export your unique model of coexistence 
among various linguistic and ethnic groups. I wish this was 
possible. Nonetheless, the Swiss model of coexistence will be 
helpful to us in the Middle East.

  [Text] Tunis, 3 Feb (MENA)-- An informed Palestinian source 
has told Tunisian paper AL-SABAH today that the agreement 
reached in Davos between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres includes a number of 
points, primarily the Israeli consent to let the Palestinian 
side take responsibility for receiving travelers to and from the 
self-rule areas. 
  The Palestinian source added that the agreement provides for 
setting up a Palestinian checkpoint that receives travelers to 
and from the self-rule areas. An Israeli checkpoint will 
exercise electronic control from a distance. Travelers wishing 
to enter Israel will be permitted to head for the Israeli 
checkpoint without being intercepted. 
  The source pointed out that the corridor linking Gaza and 
Jericho will pass through the nearby township of Idnah, Hebron, 
in the context of initial Israeli consent to let travelers from 
the self-rule areas cross into the West Bank. These travelers 
will be given enough time to cover the distance between the 
first Israeli checkpoint in the self-rule areas and the first 
Israeli checkpoint after these areas, and then proceed to the 
first Israeli military checkpoint in the destination area. 
  The Palestinian source affirmed that the Davos agreement 
included Israeli consent to put the Palestinian authority in 
charge of arranging all rituals during religious seasons in the 
al-Nabi Musa area, which Jewish pilgrims visit three times a 
year. In return, Christian Palestinians will make pilgrimages 
under their own flag to the area of al-Maghtis [where Christ was 
believed to have been baptized] without being harassed or 
intercepted by Israel. 
  The source added that Israel has agreed to let the national 
Palestinian authority extend to the Dead Sea coast and consented 
to the establishment of tourist resorts and economic 
establishments. He pointed out that the Palestinians insisted in 
the Davos draft of keeping control on the international borders 
and crossing points between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho 
and Jordan. That point is still disputed. 
  The Palestinian source concluded that this agreement might 
be 
signed in the next stage by 'Arafat and Rabin in the presence of 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, and the 
Greek foreign minister, since Greece chairs the European Union's 
current session.

<F P=106> [By 'Abd-al-Ra'uf Arna'ut] </F>
  [Text] Jerusalem -- Informed Palestinian sources have said 
that Palestinian-Egyptian talks were held recently on the 
possibility of leasing a piece of land parallel to al-'Arish 
region on the Egyptian borders with the Gaza Strip to the 
Palestinian authority slated to be set up in accordance with the 
self-rule agreement. 
  Those sources added that the Palestinians sought to lease a 
40 square km area parallel to Rafah region, south of the Gaza 
Strip, on which to build an airport. This land extends from 
Rafah's boundaries to the village of Zuwayd in al-'Arish. 
  Palestinian experts estimate that at least 30 square km, 17 
square km of which will be used as runways, are required for the 
construction of this airport. 
  The Palestinian sources, who asked to remain anonymous, said 
that the reason the Palestinians approached Egypt and asked to 
lease this land was "because of lack of space in the Gaza Strip, 
which is suffering from an immense population density." 
  Some 800,000 Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip, which is a 
360 square km area, 80 square km of which have been confiscated 
by Israel for building settlements. According to these sources, 
negotiations over the Palestinian request have so far failed to 
yield any results.

  [Text] Algiers, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Suspected Moslem 
fundamentalists have assassinated an activist in Algeria's 
Attahadi (Challenge) political party, Mohamed Touali, the party 
announced in a statement Wednesday. 
  Touali, 32, was kidnapped overnight Tuesday and his body was 
subsequently discovered, the party said. 
  He was the second member of Attahadi and the fourth 
political 
activist to be slain by suspected Islamic extremists since the 
January 27 murder of another official in the party, Ferhat 
Chibout. 
  The statement did not specify where Touali lived nor where 
the body was found. He was an employee of a state-owned company 
in the eastern town of Constantine. 
  His murder followed the killing Tuesday in the Casbah 
district of Algiers of French journalist Olivier Quemeneur and 
the wounding by gunmen of the cameraman's Australian colleague, 
Scott Allan White. 
  White was Wednesday at the Ain Nadja military hospital in a 
suburb of the capital, in very serious condition. 
  Armed Islamic groups have waged a war on the regime, 
targetting foreigners as part of their campaign, since the 
cancellation in January 1992 of a general election the Islamic 
Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. 
  The FIS, now outlawed, has blamed alleged government death 
squads for carrying out some of the killings.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 2 (AFP)--Egypt's main Muslim militant 
group on Wednesday warned foreign investors and tourists to 
leave the country, saying its next attacks would be "extremely 
tough." 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said in a statement sent to AFP 
that it would have to retaliate against the "massacre" of seven 
of its members late Tuesday by police in Cairo. 
  The statement rejected the official version that the 
militants died in a shoot-out, saying that they had been "killed 
in cold blood." 
  The group has targeted tourists in its campaign against 
President Husni Mubarak's secular government which has left 
almost 200 people dead in the past two years.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Feb (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi 
announced today that the terrorists killed in a hideout in 
northern Cairo's al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' neighborhood yesterday 
were prominent and dangerous terrorists known for their recent 
violent acts in Upper Egypt. 
  He added that the group included several suspects who had 
been on the run and others who had been convicted in connection 
with numerous terrorist cases in Upper Egypt. He said that in 
yesterday's incident no escapes occurred. 
  The interior minister explained that information was 
received 
that a group of fugitive terrorists were staying in a hideout in 
al- Zawiyah al-Hamra' and that after obtaining permission from 
the Prosecutor's Office, the hideout was stormed. He added that 
the terrorists opened fire on the security forces, who returned 
the fire. He said that a detailed statement will be issued 
later today naming the suspects and the details of the incident. 
  Al-Alfi continued that a quantity of bombs, ammunition, 
explosives, and weapons that the terrorists had been using in 
their operations were discovered in the hideout. He pointed out 
that the security forces found large sums of money with the 
seven terrorists who were killed, proving that they were hired 
agents paid for their acts, which he termed cowardly and vile. 
  The interior minister said that the police will not rest as 
long as one terrorist remains at large in Egypt but will pursue 
and arrest him. 
  The interior minister reaffirmed that the police have the 
initiative now and are conducting campaigns of arrests and 
surveillance against terrorists and all those linked to violent 
and terrorist crimes. He explained that the police are using 
scientific methods and careful planning that are based on full 
information. 
  Asked if Egypt has signed a security cooperation agreement 
with Pakistan to extradite fugitive terrorists, the interior 
minister said that there are agreements and contacts with 
various countries to exchange data and extradite criminals. 
  Hasan al-Alfi, who was speaking after inspecting an 
exhibition of stolen goods organized by the Cairo Security 
Directorate, concluded his remarks by saying that public 
security is one integral whole and that it operates concurrently 
on security, economic, criminal, and social levels. He 
explained that the police are making great efforts in all these 
fields based on the concept that their work is a vocation and 
not a mere job. 
  [Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1336 GMT on 2 February carries a 
related report about the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' police raid, 
saying: "Counselor 'Abd-al-Sami' Sharaf al-Din, public attorney 
for the Higher State Security Department, has ordered autopsies 
on the bodies of seven terrorists killed yesterday to determine 
the cause of death. The Prosecutor's Office ordered forensic 
officials to inspect the site of the incident, prepare a report, 
and submit it to the prosecution. 
  ["Counselor 'Abd-al-Sami' Sharaf al-Din inspected the 
terrorists' hideout and impounded three automatic weapons, 12 
bombs, three remote control devices, large quantities of TNT, 
and a police radio that the terrorists had stolen from an 
officer at Abu Tij Police Station after killing him. Later 
today prosecutors will question eyewitnesses and the police 
officers who took part in the raid."]

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Feb (MENA)--The State Security Intelligence 
Department has identified three of the seven terrorists who were 
killed when the security forces stormed their hideout in 
al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' in Cairo yesterday. 
  A statement issued by the Interior Ministry today identified 
the first terrorist as Yasir Zaki Abd-al-Fattah Muhammad 'Ali, a 
student at the Technical Trade Institute in Asyut and a resident 
of Dayrut. He was considered a prominent leader of the Islamic 
Group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah in Asyut. The terrorist was on 
the wanted list for several crimes, including the murder of 14 
Christians and one Muslim, shooting at a police post in Kudiyat 
Mubarak, shooting at the house of Dayrut's intelligence chief, 
and shooting at a tourist bus and killing tourist Sharon Gill, 
in addition to other terrorist crimes. 
  The second terrorist was identified as 'Abd-al-Nabi Hasanin, 
born on 20 April 1974. He was a student at the Industry School 
in Dayrut near Asyut. He was wanted for throwing an explosive 
device at a pharmacy, throwing a bomb at the Jurf Sirhan police 
post, participating in the incidents at the Murwah movie theater 
in Hulwan, assassinating Lieutenant Kamal Sha'lan, and 
assassinating assistant police officer Fikri Fadil Madi. 
  The third terrorist was identified as Tariq Muhammad 
Qurashi, 
born on 15 May 1976, unemployed, and a resident of al-Qurashiyah 
near Dayrut. He was a prominent leader of the military wing of 
the Islamic Group. He and his dead brother, Ahmad Qurashi, 
participated in the bombing of the al-Minya train as it was 
passing through Dayrut in 1992. 
  The State Intelligence Department is checking the 
fingerprints of the remaining dead terrorists to identify them. 
  The security forces seized a large quantity of weapons that 
were found in the terrorist hideout in al-Zawiyah al-Hamra'. 
They include 18 hand grenades, seven automatic weapon 
magazines, around 1,000 bullets of various calibers, an 
anti-tank projectile, an anti-personnel mine, and five 
detonators. 
  The security forces also seized two boxes of TNT, a mortar 
round inside a cloth bag, 12 electrical circuits, and four 
Taiwan-made timers. They also found a radio set belonging to 
the Baqur police post in Asyut; a cellular telephone; three 9-mm 
rifles; copper masks used to make explosive devices; one meter 
of fuse; 23,000 Egyptian pounds; and a number of documents, 
forged identity cards, and leaflets.

  [Text] Surt, January 30, JAMAHARIYA NEWS AGENCY -- The 
General People's Congress -- the meeting of the people's 
congress, people's committees, syndicates, unions and 
professional associations -- sent, at the end of the final 
session last night, the following message to the leader of the 
revolution Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi: 
  In the name of God, from this blessed part of the globe 
which 
sent a message of salvation to mankind and from which light 
shone, guiding humanity to the historic path of the masses 
epoch, O great leader, the convening of this session came at the 
climax of the popular exercise of genuine democracy with the 
message sent by the rallies and the human waves, volcanoes and 
explosions, who rallied in every Libyan Arab village village and 
city to the leader of the revolution, their liberator and 
resurrector. They also sent a strong message of warning to the 
forces of Western arrogance and vanity through the decision 
taken by the Libyan Arab people for steadfastness, defiance, and 
readiness for confrontation and defence for the revolutionary 
orientations of the Jamahiriyah without any abdication of these 
orientations or compromise as far as the national sovereignty 
and laws are concerned. 
  O great leader, at a time when the Arab political map is 
being dominated by the abandonment of the liberation orientated 
national civilisational project, the following current policies 
of reversal, the series of concessions and promotion of the 
defeatist slogan land for peace, but your principled, sincere 
and firm nationalist stance will remain the hope of all Arab 
masses throughout the greater Arab homeland, in adherence to the 
Arab national cause without any abdication. History will record 
proudly the dignified stand which you took enabling us, we the 
generation of Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, to stand tall like the palm 
trees of our country who strength is well entrenched in the soil 
and the branches freely extending towards the sky. 
  Certainly the Great Jamahiriyah will remain under your 
leadership, the heaven on earth in which no one who betrays it 
would live and its people will remain the freest and kindest of 
all peoples. 
  Allah endowed us with you as a steadfast and sincere leader 
accustomed to advocating justice, and repulsing falsehood. So 
let us go forward under your leadership and we are with you on 
the path of revolution and defiance. 
  Rely on Allah and you will always remain the conscience of 
the nation and the teacher of generations to come. 
  Allah willing we rely on you and we will be victorious. 
Forward and [words indistinct] revolutionary the struggle will 
continue. 
  Signed: the General People's Congress

  [Text] Tripoli, al-Nowar [February] 2, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY -- The assistant official spokeswoman for the French 
Foreign Ministry Catherine Colonna said that France hopes that 
the new Algerian president, Liamine Zeroual, will carry out a 
genuine political dialogue with all Algerian parties. This will 
serve to place Algeria on the road to democracy and national 
reconciliation. 
  The JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY's Arab affairs editor commented 
on this saying: 
  These official French statements constitute a blatant 
interference in the internal affairs of friendly Algeria. At 
the same time, France has acted in a silly manner towards 
Algeria. The editor added that if France had, for example, 
called for building cordial relations with Algeria then this 
would be reasonable. However, for officials to meddle in an 
internal matter which concerns Algeria, as was the case with the 
statements made by the French spokeswoman, then the matter is 
both silly and constitutes a blatant interference in Algeria's 
internal affairs. 
  The editor said that if no one could be found to say this 
then the Great Jamahiriyah will say it [word indistinct] in a 
loud voice, for France continues to see itself as a colonial 
power and as if it is its mentor. It is as if Algeria belongs 
to France and Algeria sacrificed one million and a half martyrs 
in the battles for independence and freedom against French 
colonialism. 
  Such interference, propelled by a colonialist bias, can only 
serve to increase the anger we feel against France, its 
`colonial master' mentality, and the spirit of a colonialist 
country.

  [Text] With much talk of new fighting and another 
government offensive in southern Sudan, the question is: Will 
the divisions in the rebel SPLA [Sudanese People's Liberation 
Army] give the government an easy time? The two rebel sides, 
John Garang's wing and Riak Machar's breakaway faction, 
SPLA-United, keep having talks only to go back to the bush and 
start fighting each other again. They had another go at burying 
the hatchet in Nairobi in early January. Well, Riak Machar is 
currently in London and Robin White asked him what the state of 
relations was now. 
  [Begin recording] [Machar] I think that relations are 
improving. 
  [White] Has there been any fighting at all since that 
meeting 
in early January? 
  [Machar] Not that reported to me, no. 
  [White] So, what happens next? 
  [Machar] Well, we are hoping to have another meeting to work 
out our relationship in terms of how we could cooperate at the 
frontline. 
  [White] And when would that meeting be? 
  [Machar] I hope it will take place on 7 [February] if that 
it 
is going to be made possible by the Kenyans. 
  [White] That is this weekend? 
  [Machar] Yes. 
  [White] And you will meet face to face with John Garang? 
  [Machar] Yes, we have been meeting face to face. 
  [White] How do you get on when you meet each other? 
  [Machar] We talk. 
  [White] Do you argue? 
  [Machar] Naturally, we had differences and we had to argue 
them out, yes. 
  [White] What are still the differences between you? 
  [Machar] The first difference, which we have now overcome, 
is 
the objective of the movement. Garang has accepted the right of 
self-determination for the people of south Sudan. The other 
outstanding issues are the issues on democracy and issues on 
human rights. 
  [White] That was one of the initial reasons for you breaking 
away and that you accused him of human rights abuses and of 
being dictatorial. In fact, since then he has released a lot of 
people from jail, so has he done most of what you asked him or 
not? 
  [Machar] Well, he has released most of the people and many 
others escaped and there are still others in jail. The three 
Martins -- Martin Makul, Martin Majir, Martin Quigbera -- and 
Kawaye Makwaye are still in jail. 
  [White] Where are they being held? 
  [Machar] I don't know. 
  [White] The objection that Garang seems to be having against 
you of late is that he claims that you are not doing any 
fighting against the Sudanese Army -- the Northern Sudanese Army 
-- you are too busy fighting him. Is that true? Do you accept 
that? 
  [Machar] He may be too busy fighting me, not the other way 
round. I don't think that we are not fighting the Sudan 
Government. First, look at the strategy of the Sudan Government. 
The strategy of the Sudan Government today is to take control 
of the borders, and the borders which they think are viable to 
the SPLA are Uganda and Kenya, and the person who is at those 
borders is John Garang forces. [as heard] 
  [White] Garang seems to think that you have some secret 
deal with the Sudanese Government in which the Sudanese 
Government will not attack you. 
  [Machar] Well, I don't think there is any secret deal 
between 
SPLA-United and the Sudan Government. If there is one let him 
produce it. 
  [White] The signs are that there is a major offensive on the 
way from the Khartoum Government, can you withstand this? 
  [Machar] Well, there is a major offensive. It will be the 
12th major offensive since we started the war in 1983 and we 
withstood the previous ones. I think, yes, we will withstand 
this also. 
  [White] But might you not this time lose? Isn't the enemy -- 
your enemy -- getting stronger? 
  [Machar] By the way, even if the enemy takes over all the 
towns which are under the SPLAs' -- both SPLA -- that is not the 
end of the war. We will quickly revert to guerrilla tactics. 
  [White] Do you think the people of southern Sudan can stand 
much more? 
  [Machar] They have been fighting nearly now for 40 years. It 
is because they believe in the cause of the struggle. Yes, it 
is true that there is a desperate humanitarian situation. But 
they are not giving up the fight now. 
  [White] But are you quite sure that the people regard your 
soldiers as friends? 
  [Machar] Our soldiers come from the people. They are 
children of South Sudan. They have fathers, they have mothers, 
they have families who are South Sudanese, so they are friends 
of people of South Sudan. 
  [White] They are not the bringers of death and destruction? 
  [Machar] Not at all because if they were regarded as such 
then the civil population would not contribute their children to 
go and fight this war. 
  [White] Won't you accept that things have never sank so low, 
things were never so bad as now in the southern Sudan? 
  [Machar] Every liberation movement has its ups and downs. 
[end recording] 
  Well, it seems the government offensive in southern Sudan 
is, 
in fact, well underway, according to reports from neighboring 
Uganda. From Kampala, our correspondent Eppajar Ojulu telexed 
this report. [read by announcer] 
  According to travelers arriving from the northwestern Arua 
region, the offensive started during the middle of last week. 
The travelers included businessmen who usually frequent the 
Uganda-Sudan border and they told me that during the past two 
days, loud explosions coming from inside Sudan have been heard 
from Uganda's side of the border. They said the explosions 
sounded like long-range heavy artillery pounding suspected rebel 
positions. I have been informed by usually reliable sources 
that Colonel John Garang's SPLA faction was the main target of 
the dry season offensive, which is concentrating on the 
rebel-occupied areas in the Eastern Equatoria and Western 
Equatoria Provinces. 
  The sources said that thousands of troops supported by 
artillery were advancing southwards towards the Uganda border on 
one front and the Kenyan border on the other. The objective of 
the offensive is to cut off Garang's forces from their main 
supply routes suspected to be in Uganda and Kenya. The 
offensive has become the subject of discussion among the people 
in Arua, who are yet again beginning to see a new influx of 
refugees. One businessman, who claims he sometimes goes deep 
inside the rebel-controlled area, said that the shelling was 
being done randomly by the government troops. He claimed that 
three days ago, one of the shells had landed on a church and 
smashed it.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih has again 
expressed Sudan's keenness and desire for the efforts of the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] 
states initiative to produce the expected results in achieving 
peace. This was stated during separate meetings with the 
foreign ministers of Kenya and Uganda on the sidelines of the 
meetings of the ministerial council of the OAU in Addis Ababa. 
  Dr. Abu-Salih explained that during his meetings with the 
two 
ministers, he declared Sudan's interest in working to speed up 
steps to reach a comprehensive and acceptable solution that 
guarantees complete stability in the country. He said such a 
solution should end the dispute and its consequences. He added 
that the two ministers expressed their understanding of the 
Sudanese Government's stand and its seriousness in striving to 
find a peaceful solution to the dispute in the south. They also 
expressed their appreciation for the praise for the efforts of 
the IGADD states in this respect.

  [Text] Some Arab and Western capitals are following with 
great interest the trend within the Sudanese Government to grant 
Sudanese citizenship to any Muslim, since this is considered a 
first of its kind by a government since the naturalization law 
was created. 
  Diplomatic sources in Cairo noted that the Khartoum 
government intends to pass a new draft law on naturalization. 
This law stipulates granting Sudanese citizenship to every 
Muslim this coming month. The sources added that if this 
happens, large numbers of extremist terrorists will find shelter 
and a land to use as a springboard for their terrorist 
activities. 
  It is worth noting here that the current naturalization law 
stipulates that the applicant for citizenship must have resided 
in Sudan for not less than 12 years and should not have a 
criminal record of a crime that violates security and honor. 
  These diplomatic sources noted that there are more than 
5,000 
men and women extremist Muslims residing in Sudan. Most of them 
are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine. 
The number of Islamists from Morocco known to these sources is 
50. There are over 370 Egyptians known by their "code" 
[preceding word in English] names. There are also over 300 
Tunisians who belong to the Ennahda Movement headed by Rachid 
Ghanouchi. 
  These sources noted that among these groups, there are some 
Syrians, Iraqis, and Yemenis who live in Sudan under the cover 
of being businessmen and contractors. Most of these Islamists 
live in the areas of al-Riyad, al-Ta'if, al-Manshiyah, Kawbar, 
and Madinat al-Mughtaribin in Madinat al-Khartoum Bahri.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice 
president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP], has welcomed a decisive and responsible Egyptian role in 
resolving the crushing crisis in his country. He praised Egypt 
for the immense sacrifices and assistance it offered for the 
revolution in Yemen and for its constant support for current 
Yemeni issues. 
  Interviewed by AL-AHRAM at his residence in Aden, al-Bid 
stressed that Yemen cannot accept being a country of domestic or 
international terrorism that may harm the Egyptian people. 
  He said if the Arab countries fail to join forces, they will 
find themselves in a difficult situation. 
  Al-Bid said that the current crisis in Yemen has put to a 
real test his country's ability to establish a state of 
institutions and stability despite the stimuli of confrontation. 
  He noted that there has been no clear, unified vision toward 
the unified state. The adversary forces, he added, did not give 
the YSP enough time; the party was pushed to a difficult 
position through assassination of its leading figures and 
statesmen, and even desecration of houses. He noted the party's 
sacrifices to establish a state that will take Yemen to the 21st 
century, not return it to the 19th century. 
  Al-Bid considered the recently concluded Pledge and Accord 
document as merely a step toward rectifying the course of unity. 
  He stressed that the crisis between him and Yemeni President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is not personal, but one among all ruling 
organizations and bodies involved in the current dialogue.

  [Text] Jordanian Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has told 
us that seven people were arrested yesterday for interrogation 
in connection with the bomb blast at an al-Zarqa' cinema house. 
The minister did not elaborate. However, an official Jordanian 
source said that four of the arrested people are charged with 
last Thursday's blast in Amman and that the other three are 
suspected of having a connecttion with the bomb attack in 
al-Zarqa yesterday. 
  The source said that those arrested belong to groups of 
returnees from Afghanistan, adding that the explosive material, 
Acetone Peroxide, was used in both blasts but said that the 
explosives were prepared in a very crude manner which means that 
the group did not have enough experience in such explosions. 
  The two explosions this week resulted in the injury of nine 
people, two seriously.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "On Wrong Track Again"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has effectively closed 
the door on lifting or even relaxing the sanctions imposed on 
Baghdad when he told U.S. congress Monday [31 January] that 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn is still determined to develop 
nuclear weapons. This assessment came in spite of President 
Clinton's assurance to his nation that Iraq's nuclear weapons 
programme is "out of business" and Baghdad's official commitment 
to put its entire weapons programme including its nuclear 
capabilities, if any, under long-term international supervision. 
  Why then Washington still clings to its conviction that Iraq 
continues to covet nuclear and other mass destruction arsenal 
and therefore must be denied any relaxing of the punitive 
measures is something that goes beyond reasonable comprehension. 
State behaviour cannot be judged on metaphysical basis but 
rather on hard evidence unless of course there is no intention 
whatsoever to treat the Arab Gulf country differently no matter 
how far it goes to meet its obligations under U.N. Security 
Council resolutions. Since Iraq's mass destruction capabilities 
are for all intents and purposes "out of business," and will be 
monitored for as long as one can see, one fails to understand 
how Washington or anybody else for that matter can rightly guess 
the Iraqi intentions and find sinister plans in them. 
  The White House is also wrong in apportioning blame for the 
suffering of the Iraqi masses as a result of the sanctions 
solely on the Iraqi regime. Such a view is of little relief to 
the greater majority of Iraqis who have not been able to find or 
afford to buy basic medicines and food staples for over three 
years now, given the fact that the regime in Baghdad is solidly 
entrenched and has an effective grip on power, telling the 
people that they have only their leadership to blame is of no 
practical comfort. If pressure must continue to be applied 
against the Iraqi regime under all circumstances there is a good 
case for applying it in such a way as to minimise damage to the 
innocent people. Such a distinction between ruler and ruled 
could and should be made, and ways and means to give it effect 
is obviously not beyond the ingenuity of the western nations 
which still spearhead the hostile campaign against the country. 
  President Clinton was on stronger grounds when he called for 
the introduction of pluralistic democracy to the country as a 
condition for its full rehabilitation with the international 
community. Baghdad has yet to make significant movement in the 
direction of democracy and this is a source of alarm not only to 
Washington but also to the entire region, not to mention its own 
people. There is clearly no long-term solution to the problem 
in that country as long as its people are denied democracy and 
basic human rights. Meanwhile, however, no matter where the 
responsibility lies, the Iraqi people themselves must enjoy the 
right to feed themselves properly and find the necessary 
medicines to treat the sick among them.

  [Text] Amman--Jordan Wednesday [2 February] said Iraq would 
continue to rely heavily on the Red Sea port of al-'Aqabah after 
sanctions end because its own ports could not handle the demand. 
  "Iraq's dependence on the port of al-'Aqabah in the event of 
the lifting of sanctions will be primary because neither their 
port of Umm Qasr nor even Mersin Port would be enough to handle 
all their goods," Jordan's Transport Minister Adib Halasah told 
Reuters. 
  Jordanian concerns rose last November when Iraq began 
importing through Umm Qasr and said whenever possible it would 
directly import U.N.-permitted goods--mostly food and medicine. 
  "Whatever the size of Umm Qasr, and it's a large port, the 
anticipated rise in Iraq's import needs would make them need not 
just al-'Aqabah but other ports," said the minister. 
  Mr. Halasah said use of Umm Qasr, Iraq's only port, would 
not 
affect al-'Aqabah as "it would continue to be more economical 
for Iraq to import its European cargo through it." Umm Qasr 
would be used mainly for imports from the Far East. 
  He expected activity in al-'Aqabah to surge when sanctions 
end. Less than 100 trailers travel the al-'Aqabah-Baghdad route 
daily against 400 before the Gulf crisis. 
  Mr. Halasah said upgrading and modernisation of al='Aqabah 
was underway to handle "the expected large volume of demand." 
  Sanctions were imposed because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
in 1990. Al-'Aqabah has also suffered from the U.N. inspection 
of al-'Aqabah-bound ships for goods that could violate the 
sanctions. 
  Port activity has fallen from pre-Gulf war level peaks of 20 
million tonnes annually to around 13 million tonnes in 1993. 
  In an indication of confidence, Mr. Halasah said the 
Iraq-Jordan Land Transport Company decided in Baghdad last week 
to buy 100 Renault trucks to modernise its 420 trailer fleet. 
  The firm, set up in 1981 as a 50-50 joint venture between 
the 
two states, is registered as a Jordanian company and is not 
subject to aspects of the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq.

  [Text] Amman (J.T.)--Despite international sanctions 
against Iraq the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transport Company (IJTLC) 
registered a $3 million profit for 1993 and has decided to add 
100 trucks to its present fleet of 420. 
  According to the Jordan News Agency, PETRA, Transport 
Minister Adeeb Halasa Friday [28 January] said that at its 
meting in Baghdad, the company also "reviewed plans for 
activating operations once the sanctions against Iraq are 
lifted." 
  The company, jointly owned by the Baghdad and Amman 
governments, had forcast a $10 million profit for 1993 in a 
board meeting held last May. 
  There was no official explanation for the reduced profit, 
reported REUTER. 
  But it was believed to be a result of reduced Iraqi trade 
through Jordan due to the kingdom's compliance with the 
sanctions, Iraq's introduction of strict trade and monetary 
regulations and the thorough inspection of cargo vessels bound 
for al-'Aqabah. 
  Mr. Halasa's comments were made in Baghdad at the end of a 
four-day annual board meeting, co-chaired by Mr. Halasa and his 
Iraqi counterpart Ahmad Mortada. 
  According to Petra the board also decided that plans for 
1994 
should include the prospect of operating its trucks outside 
Jordanian and Iraqi territory. 
  The company, which oversees freight between both countries, 
was established in 1981 with a capital of $50 million. 
  Mr. Halasa, who returned to Amman Friday, said that $8 
million has been allocated for the purchase of the new trucks, 
but he declined to say when the purchase would be made. 
  He said the company discussed plans for operating a weekly 
flight between Amman and Baghdad to carry ailing Iraqis who 
cannot afford the 1000-kilometre overland trip between the two 
countries. [sentence as published] 
  "We discussed all the measures that should be adopted once 
the United Nations approves Iraq's request for a weekly flight 
between both countries that was submitted two months ago," Mr. 
Halasa told PETRA. 
  The agency also quoted an Iraqi official as saying that Iraq 
will continue to use al-'Aqabah for its imports despite the 
reopening of Umm Qasr Port in the Gulf in November. 
  Jordan was concerned that Iraqi imports through al-'Aqabah 
could diminish because of the reopening of Umm Qaser.

  [Text] Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, Oman's minister of 
state for foreign affairs, today arrived in Amman on a brief 
visit to Jordan during which he will relay an oral message to 
His Majesty King Husayn from his brother Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id 
of Oman. 
  He was received at Amman Civilian Airport by Talal Sat'an 
al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, senior Foreign 
Ministry staff, and the Omani ambassador in Amman. 
  Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah spoke to our correspondent 
Muhammad al-Hajaya, and said: 
  [Begin Bin-'Abdallah recording] I have an oral message from 
his majesty the sultan to his brother His Majesty King Husayn 
Bin-Talal. The message concerns issues of joint interests and 
consultations over various issues. Oman, like Jordan, is 
concerned about all dimensions of the Arab interests and we hope 
the joint effort of the two kings will, God willing, be a 
blessed effort and bear fruit to benefit the Arab and Muslim 
nations. 
  Consultations between the leaders are continuing and I 
believe that circumstances are now better than what they were in 
the past. We hope that the efforts will, God willing, bear fruit 
for the benefit of common interests. [end recording]

  [Text] A Chinese delegation has arrived in Amman for trade 
talks on bolstering commercial exchanges between the two 
countries. The delegation, led by deputy chief of the Chinese 
Council for International Trade Development, Ye Peng, will meet 
private and public sector economists. 
  The trade balance between the two countries is still in 
China's favor. Jordan's imports of Chinese goods surged from 
$29 million in 1991 to $53 million in 1992. Jordanian exports 
to China, mainly potash, rose from $18 million in 1990 to 32.5 
million dinars [as heard] in 1991.

<F P=106> ["Special to THE STAR" by Ahmad Shakir and Ra'id al-'Abid] </F>
  [Text] For the third time in as many months, the Government 
of Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali went into the Lower House 
Wednesday [2 February] to fight for its life, this time over the 
explosive issue of food and medicine in Jordan. 
  Dr. al-Majali was out of the country when his Health 
Minister 
Dr. 'Abd al-Rahim Malhas went on record to expose his own 
ministry and food and medicine wholesalers, and to point a 
finger at Dr. al-Majali himself two weeks ago. Dubbed as the 
"Malhasgate scandal," it created national hysteria, and deputies 
demanded a special session to hear the Government's reply to 
accusations made by a cabinet minister. 
  On Wednesday, Dr. Malhas marched into the House carrying an 
800-page file said to contain names and figures documenting 
serious violations concerning food and drug imports. The file 
also implicates former officials, who had allowed the import and 
distribution of certain food products when Government 
laboratories had indicated that they were not fit for human 
consumption. 
  Dr. Malhas, who delivered the Government's reply, defended 
his press statements and said that Jordanians are victims of 
greedy food and medicine merchants. In his 70-minute speech, 
Dr. Malhas attacked the "whales" who imported food not fit for 
human consumption, and medicines that do not meet international 
standards. He said he had documents that prove some medicine 
importers are making over 300 percent in profits, and some as 
high as a 1000 percent profit on certain medicine shipments. He 
added that these companies had threatened to stop medicine 
imports if the Government did not agree to price increases. He 
went on to say that certain medicines that are available in 
Jordan do not meet international standards, while others do not 
even meet the standards of the countries where they are 
manufactured. 
  Dr. Malhas added that most of the imported meat, foodstuff 
and cheese is transported into Jordan in unrefrigerated trucks 
in temperatures reaching 35 degrees, and that the ministry had 
destroyed some of these because it was not fit for human 
consumption. 
  After Dr. Malhas' speech, deputies asked for copies of his 
file, while the Speaker of the Lower House asked the deputies 
not to pass the documents to the press so as not to interfere 
with the legal measures that are expected to be taken against 
those implicated. 
  The file is kept under police guard and its distribution is 
restricted to deputies until the House decides what to do with 
the case. The House will start to deliberate on it in the next 
session on Saturday. 
  In an attempt to take Dr. al-Majali off the hook, Dr. Malhas 
told the deputies that the ministry of health, with the support 
of the Prime Minister, took immediate measures to enforce health 
regulations and to fight what Dr. Malhas described as 
international food gangsters that sell bad foodstuff. 
  Dr. Malhas said there were gaps in regulations that allow 
medicine importers to import medicine into Jordan without 
getting approval from the ministry. He said the US Congress had 
passed legislation permitting US drug companies to export 
products which are otherwise banned in the United States. He 
added that a number of drugs available in the local market are 
not registered with the ministry and called for establishing an 
authority to monitor foodstuffs and medical products. 
  Dr. Malhas again warned of the greed of the so-called 
"whales", a few wholesalers who make their fortune by importing 
expired foodstuff into the country. 
  Dr. Malhas also mentioned cases where expiry dates have been 
changed and health certificates forged so that food could be 
allowed into the country. He said his file documents names and 
incidents of many of these cases. 
  He said the ministry had shut down over 16,000 factories, 
shops, bakeries and restaurants for health violations. 
  Al-Ramtha deputy 'Abd-al-Karim al-Doughmi supported Dr. 
Malhas's position, while Irbid deputy 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah 
accused him of negligence. The Islamists did not take a 
position, but sources said they might oppose the minister after 
they received counter information from the president of the 
Pharmacists Association and IAF member Husam Musmar and a number 
of wholesalers who are also IAF members. 
  The fact that Dr. Malhas has provided evidence documenting 
serious health violations will undoubtedly shift attention from 
the Government to the so-called corruption cases. 
  Meanwhile, innocent traders and local pharmaceutical 
companies continue to suffer as a result of Dr. Malhas' initial 
statements. So far, Sudan and Tunis have suspended drug 
shipments until more information on the status of Jordan-made 
food and drugs become available. Dr. Malhas last last week said 
that Jordanian medicines are of high quality and that they were 
not included in his list of violators.

  [Text] Amman (J.T.)--The Ministry of Interior Monday [31 
January] granted legal status to the Constitutional Jordanian 
Arab Front Party [hizb al-jabhah al-urduniyah al-'arabiyah 
al-dusturiyah], making it the 22nd Jordanian party to be 
legalised. The Jordan News Agency, PETRA, Monday reported that 
the Ministry informed the secretary general of the party, Milhim 
al-Tall, of its decision. The party's constituent assembly last 
month authorised Mr. al-Tall along with members Ahmad 
al-'Awayishah, Shahir al-Rawashidah, 'Ali al-Talafih and 
Muhammad Khattab to apply for licensing. The party, which is 
almost exclusively made up of former adherents to the Syrian 
Ba'th Party, joins four other political parties on the pan-Arab 
spectrum. These parties are the Jordan Socialist Ba'th Party, 
the Progressive Arab Ba'th Party, the Jordan Arab Democratic 
Party and the most recently licensed National Action Front 
Party. The party's leader, Mr. al-Tall, ran for a Muslim seat 
in Amman's Third District in the 1989 parliamentary elections. 
During his campaign, he openly advocated Jordan's union with 
Syria.

Obstructing Peace"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus -- Syria yesterday accused Israel of 
continuing to adhere to its method, obstructing any tangible 
progress in the peace process. Authoritative Syrian sources 
told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Washington negotiations have so 
far inspired no hope of achieving success in the peace process. 
And that the Israeli delegation continues to avoid providing 
clear and frank answers with regard to the issue of complete 
withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied Arab territories, 
which is the basis for a just and comprehensive peace. 
  The sources added that the round to be held between the 
Syrian and Israeli delegations will be crucial in determining 
the fate and future of the negotiation process, especially as 
the United States has decided to assume the task of imparting 
the necessary impetus to the political peace process on all 
tracks and renewed before the world in Geneva its commitment to 
achieving a just and comprehensive peace on all fronts. 
  The sources went on: Thus Rabin and his government will be 
subjected to a test with regard to their willingness to respond 
to the will of the international community and Washington. 
  The Syrian sources urged the international community to 
shoulder the responsibility for salvaging and implementing its 
legitimacy and putting an end to Israeli evasion. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-Rumayhi, chief editor of Kuwait's </F>
AL-'ARABI magazine: "Mountains Don't Meet, People Do"] 
<H5>  [19 Jan p 15] </H5>
  [Text] A transmitted proverb or common saying that recurs 
in numerous languages says something to the effect that two 
mountains cannot meet, but two people can. In other words, 
mountains cannot meet, whereas people can. This saying or 
proverb is reiterated on occasions when adversaries, estranged 
people, and people in disagreement meet, especially when the 
desire or ambition to meet exists. 
  This idea comes to mind when one sees and hears what 
millions 
saw and heard via the live television relay of the meeting 
between U.S. President Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad in Geneva last Sunday. 
  Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, which must have 
been drafted in advance because it is not for nothing or just to 
drink a cup of coffee together that prominent leaders 
meet--regardless of the outcome, we say that this meeting in 
itself gives a good idea of the developments occurring in the 
current policy. 
  Each of the two men who met amid strict security measures in 
Geneva came from a different land, different time, with a 
different legacy, and also with a different dream. But they met, 
and in this contrast lies the essence of the harmony that will 
perhaps dominate the political logic of the post-cold war world. 
In this contrast lies the fall of the ideological givens and the 
collapse of the old guard in today's, and perhaps in tomorrow's, 
world 
  At the press conference held after the meeting, President 
Clinton said that he had heard about the Syrian president's 
endurance and that he became certain of this endurance through 
the discussions which lasted more than four hours between the 
two of them and after which he had to take a break to rest. 
President Clinton added that despite this, the two men were able 
to discuss numerous issues. 
  This reference shows not only what news agencies reported on 
the eve of the meeting about the personal qualities of each of 
the two presidents but also indicate, if we dive beyond the 
surface of the words, the degree of difference in the makeup and 
aspirations of each of the two presidents. But despite this, the 
meeting went on and continued. It did not break up the way the 
Reykjavik summit in Iceland between Gorbachev and Reagan near 
the end of the cold war broke up. 
  The world has changed to such a degree that decisionmakers 
in 
all parts of this world seek to meet, in spite of their 
differences. Reports, the likes of which President Clinton must 
have read before meeting with al-Asad, say that the Syrian 
president is the last Arab radical, that he is the "cunning 
ascetic" who is characterized by "patience, cunning, and the 
determination to maintain a vital role for himself in the 
regional and international arenas." The reports add that he is 
an "Arab nationalist with a penetrating insight and one who 
always clings to the long-range view of affairs." 
  On the other side, the U.S. President seems to be the 
antithesis of his partner at the meeting. In addition to the 
difference of generations to which each of the two presidents 
belongs and the nearly two-decade difference in their ages, 
Clinton is as far from radicalism as can be. He is closer to the 
impetuosity characterizing the members of his generation, which 
was raised in the embraces of the boundless U.S. liberalism and 
of the pragmatism that hallows no particular tactic or strategy 
and that emanates from the dynamic U.S. spirit which moves with 
extraordinary flexibility within the framework of the immediate 
moment and interest. 
  It may be said that personal dimensions are nothing but a 
narrow margin on the cards of the major players at the political 
table. What is fundamental and more important in their cards 
lies in the legacy of government in their countries and in 
certain strategies that are not determined by individuals, 
regardless of the degree of their influence, but by their 
countries' major interests. Even in this regard, the distance 
was immense between the two leaders at last Sunday's summit in 
Geneva. 
  Al-Asad went to Geneva, carrying in his quiver arrows aimed 
at certain targets, which have been defined by observers as: 
refraining from bargaining on any pan-Arab constants, especially 
land. Land is sacred in the political education that was 
received by the Syrian president's generation and which has 
continued to be disseminated among subsequent generations, 
especially in Syria. This is a pan-Arab strategy. The Israelis 
are aware of this. Gad Ben Ari, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin's spokesman, has said, "I don't expect any flexibility to 
develop in the Syrian position and I don't expect Syria to 
reduce the price it demands in return for peace." The same view 
is reflected in a statement made by Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's 
ambassador to Washington, who said prior to Sunday's summit, 
"There is a difference between the hopes that Syria and the 
United States attach to these meetings. Of course, there is a 
difference between the Syrian hopes and Israeli hopes." It is 
well known that Rabinovich heads the Israeli delegation to the 
bilateral talks with Syria--talks which have been running in 
place for more than a year. 
  So, the Golan is not just a strategic Syrian plateau from 
which it is difficult for Israel to withdraw. Rather, it is a 
symbol of the immense disagreement within the meeting and a 
stumbling block on the path of the peace negotiations. It is 
also evidence of the new logic that calls for continuing the 
dialogue despite the evident impossibility of reaching 
agreement. Even though the new Israeli Government accepted the 
principle of withdrawal from the Golan Heights for the first 
time in September 1992, it said that this withdrawal would not 
be a complete withdrawal. A week before the Clinton-al-Asad 
meeting, Rabin declared, "To date, I have only talked about 
withdrawal from the Golan, not from the entire Golan. This is my 
position." Yosi Beilin, the Israeli deputy foreign minister, has 
said within nearly the same context, "I am convinced that the 
establishment of Jewish settlements in the Golan Heights or in 
any other territories after the 1967 war was a mistake. But now 
that the settlements exist, we cannot erase them from the map so 
simply." The Golan, where 12,000 Israeli settlers live in 33 
settlements next to 16,000 Druze citizens, continues to create 
obstacles. Israeli settlers have sent Clinton a message through 
the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to ask him not to pressure Israel 
to withdraw from the heights. Sammy Bar-Lev, a leader of the 
settlers in the occupied Syrian heights, has said, "The U.S. 
diplomat who received the message has asserted that the U.S. 
policy is based on not pressuring Israel." 
  So, the obstacle is huge. But the endeavors have not ceased, 
especially when we learn that those who have taken over the 
Middle East dossier in the Clinton administration are friends of 
Israel, which Clinton characterized in his election campaign as 
the "strategic and democratic ally." In one of his messages to 
voters, Clinton said, "Yes, Israel and the United States are at 
a turning point.... We ask you for generous financial support. 
Will you help me restore logic to the U.S.-Israeli relationship? 
Please, answer today and be generous. I swear that if I am 
elected president, I will never disappoint Israel." Figuring 
prominently among those who have taken over the Middle East 
dossier is Martin Indyk, an ex-chairman of Washington's Middle 
East Policy Institute, which is close to AIPAC [American-Israel 
Public Affairs Committee]. He was asked to draft an analysis to 
help formulate Clinton's Middle East plan. Indyk was helped in 
this regard by Les Aspin and Samuel Lewis. The former is a 
member of the advisory board of JENSA [as transliterated], a 
Jewish institute, and the second was a U.S. ambassador to Israel 
and then worked as chairman of the Israeli Bank Leumi. For the 
negotiations, Indyk proposed a U.S. policy that would embrace 
the Israeli viewpoint to the letter, whether on bilateral or 
regional negotiation issues. Indyk also insisted on rejecting 
the PLO and the idea of a Palestinian state and emphasized the 
need to besiege and pressure Syria and to give absolute priority 
to Israel's needs. 
<H5>  [20 Jan p 15] </H5>
  [Text] In view of all of these circumstances, it may seem 
to those who experienced the old-style politics that any meeting 
between Clinton and al-Asad would be futile and a waste of time. 
But there are new considerations that become revealed when 
matters are viewed from a new angle. 
  For Syria, and we mean President al-Asad here, there are 
fundamental developments that make the world one that is 
different from the world in which Syria set the ceiling of its 
pan-Arab aspirations. The main support for Syria's military 
capability, and we mean here the Soviet Union, has nearly 
evaporated. The Arab system in which Syria formed a main axis 
has disintegrated and broken down since Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait and since the subsequent breakdowns, as a result of which 
the Arab system has nearly collapsed. All these developments 
make the Syrian determination to cling to patience and obstinacy 
some sort of a miracle, especially Syria's rejection of 
'Arafat's performance in the Gaza- Jericho accord. Syria 
bargained on the meager chances of success of the big hopes 
attached to this accord. It won the wager when the day for 
withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Jericho arrived without the 
accomplishment of this withdrawal. This point was added to the 
miracle of the Syrian obstinacy which borders on being some sort 
of extraordinarily sensitive political intuition or some sort of 
lucky strikes that come only to those who deserve them. 
  So, there are changes in the shape of the world around 
Syria. 
Despite its proficient intuition or its good luck, Syria is 
aware of the dimensions of this change. 
  As for Clinton's United States, there is something new here 
too, despite the U.S. strategic constants. Peter Tarnoff, U.S. 
undersecretary of state, has said, "Washington's international 
role will diminish because of the end of the cold war and 
because of the domestic U.S. economic crises." Even though U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher hastened to refute his 
deputy's statements, saying, "The United States holds, and will 
continue to hold, its distinguished place at the top of the new 
world order," Tarnoff's statements are profoundly significant. 
They are similar in nature to facts revealed by a slip of the 
tongue and they provide an indication of dimensions of the 
crisis experienced vis-a-vis the developments which the new 
Democrat U.S. administration is trying to absorb after a long 
absence from the White House. In addition to the strategic 
surprise embodied in the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, a 
collapse which has put the United States in the labyrinth of one 
who is looking for his next foe after the disappearance of a 
stubborn foe--in addition to this state of political ambiguity, 
the new administration lacked young cadres capable of keeping up 
with the consecutive developments emanating from the 
disappearance of the foe who had determined the power of the 
United States itself and who had mobilized its latent strengths. 
This is why Clinton has been compelled to rely on numerous 
figures from Carter's administration. Moreover, the Democrats 
have had to give up many of their conventional ideas and to 
adopt some Republican ideas and, consequently, they have had to 
deal with the U.S. foreign tendencies selectively and on a 
case-by-case basis. Therefore, it has become possible to ignore 
conventional constants in the Democrats' policy (such as 
sovereignty, democracy, human rights, and the UN's role) to 
adopt some sort of interventionism, which is called in the 
Democrats' new literature a "new kind of international 
intervention." But this intervention is indebted essentially to 
the Republicans' conventional tendencies. 
  Between the constant and the changeable in the new U.S. 
strategies, there arises to the surface a question about the 
Middle East's place in this state of affairs. The answer is 
summed up in that the United States will not confine itself to 
dealing with Israel as just a strategic ally, but will also deal 
with it as a "strategic partner," according to Dr. Muhammad 
al-Sayyid Sa'id, an expert on Arab strategy, who has added that 
the U.S. view of Israel as a strategic ally in the Middle East 
"means large possibilities of expansion in concluding joint 
weapons development programs, especially anti-rocket missiles. 
The important difference here is that the doves in the U.S. 
international military strategy are hawks where Israel is 
concerned, and they are loyal allies of Israel in particular." 
  All these circumstances make the observer who examines what 
is below the surface closely realize that Israel's strategic 
weight is increasing, not decreasing, in the body of the U.S. 
policy. But the careful observer must also realize that the 
Arabs' refraining--especially by Syria which stands on the 
frontline with Israel--from dealing with this state of affairs 
represents silence on a tumor that grows and spreads until it 
becomes able to devour the entire body or it represents silence 
on a benign tumor that could become malignant if precautions are 
not taken to avert its further transformation. 
  It seems that the Syrian president has chosen to deal with 
this condition without delay. Meanwhile, the U.S. President 
seeks to move efficiently with his administration beyond just 
rearranging the affairs of his house to dealing with the world 
outside this house. It is no coincidence that Sunday's summit in 
Geneva came as a stop in a trip that took Bill Clinton to the 
den of his old foe to peacefully clip this foe's last claw in 
return for a few billion to be paid in installments. Clinton 
succeeded in wresting and disassembling the Ukraine's nuclear 
missiles and in purchasing the uranium they contain. He also 
succeeded in staging a scene that is of profound significance to 
the Americans--a scene embodied in turning the direction of the 
nuclear missiles of the former Soviet Union, which are found in 
Russia currently, away from U.S. cities. Perhaps at his meeting 
in Geneva, Clinton sought to eliminate the threat from a region 
that is of fundamental concern to the U.S. strategic interests. 
At a time when the new U.S. administration views Israel, 
according to its advisers' vision, as a strategic ally, it 
realizes that the ignition of any fires in the region will burn 
some of its interests. This is why the endeavor to launch a 
state of peace in the region is a sincere endeavor, even if it 
has been coupled with securing the "highest ceiling" of 
conditions or price in favor of Israel. 
  Yes, there are conflicting and intersecting interests in the 
Arab-Israeli condition. But by changing the perspective and 
taking the new developments into account, the examiner can find 
fine threads of joint interests if peace is accomplished, even 
if at the highest ceiling of the conditions of the parties 
concerned. The worsening danger of religious radicalism is 
something that all can see, be they Arabs, Americans, or 
Israelis. Transforming the battlefields into open markets 
provides numerous or some opportunities, even to the weaker 
parties within these markets, provided that the will to be 
industrious is there. It seems that "Syria's merchants" are 
confident of their skill and aren't afraid of opening these 
markets. 
  The world has changed swiftly in recent years, and it is 
still changing at an accelerating pace. It seems that all have 
developed the conviction that woe will befall those who fail to 
catch up with this train. 
  Sunday's meeting in Geneva between al-Asad and Clinton was 
some sort of catching up with the train of the speeding changes. 
All concealed results not withstanding, it suffices that this 
summit has produced a declaration of readiness to come out of 
the old fortresses and an acceptance of the logic of change. The 
U.S. President stated most explicitly that Syria is the key to 
comprehensive peace in the region and President al-Asad 
expressed his readiness to shoulder all the consequences of 
peace with Israel. 
  Truly, mountains do not meet, but people do. Mountains 
collapse if they move. But the outcome of every endeavor by men 
is an addition, or at least an addition in which there is no 
loss. We are confident that the meeting was a gain for all, or 
so we hope.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In a commentary today, TISHRIN says: The entire 
population of Damascus took to the streets, raising banners of 
sorrow and mourning and expressing their deep pain for the 
national loss represented by the death of Basil al-Asad. In a 
mammoth march of 1.5 million people, Damascus renewed its 
truthfulness to the great national leader, President Hafiz 
al-Asad, and expressed its love and sympathy to him. 
  TISHRIN adds: What has befallen leader al-Asad has been a 
blow to Syria as a whole. Every house and family are now 
bereaved. Yesterday, Damascus was a bright and lofty symbol of 
national unity whose pillars were laid down by President Hafiz 
al-Asad, who has strengthened this unity over the years. 
Al-Asad nurtured this unity by his work, sincerity, and 
struggle. This unity has borne fruit in terms of pride, 
dignity, and steadfastness in the face of enemies and suspect 
plots; in terms of adherence to values, principles, rights, 
land, and sanctities; and in terms of the relentless defense 
until the return of all the occupied Arab territories and the 
establishment of the Palestinian people's rights. 
  TISHRIN says: Today, Syria is waging its greatest ever 
battle, namely, the battle for a just and comprehensive peace 
that will end occupation, return the land, and establish rights 
and truth. TISHRIN notes that the firm national unity as 
expressed by our people on this great national loss, and which 
Damascus expressed by its mammoth march, will strengthen Syria's 
stand in its fierce battle for just and comprehensive peace. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: The great departed has left pain 
and sadness among his family and the Syrian families, but leader 
al-Asad has always derived strength and determination from the 
people's trust and waged the greatest and most noble battles. 
His last battle, the battle for a just and comprehensive peace, 
will be a new deed to be added to his many immortal deeds. 
  The newspaper AL-THAWRAH stresses that the march that was 
staged in bereaved Damascus yesterday was an expression of the 
sincerest condolences to leader al-Asad and his honorable family 
on this grievous calamity. 
  Al-THAWRAH says: This shocking calamity was unexpected. 
However, God's will is unavoidable, and the patient believers 
are the only ones who can stand fast and pass this test. Just 
as he has always been at all difficult times and in misfortunes, 
President al-Asad was, despite the calamity, the great leader 
and father whose heart has enough room for everyone and for all 
griefs and sorrows. He is the one who consoled all the sons of 
the nation who were bereaved of the noble knight, Basil. 
  AL-THAWRAH explains the nature of the stage and the size of 
the grave threats and challenges to the homeland and the nation. 
This, the paper say, necessitates that we rise above our pain 
and heal our wounds in order to continue the battle of existence 
and destiny and of restoring rights. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: The Syrian people were not alone in living 
the sorrow and anxiety, for the entire nation, throughout the 
greater homeland, mourned and shed tears on the departure of the 
knight Basil out of their faithfulness to the leader and father 
who carried their pan-Arab issues and concerns and who has 
honestly defended and is still defending them. The people and 
the nation stood at the side of President al-Asad, wishing him 
long life and strength so he will continue to be the inspired 
leader under whose banners the people will continue to line up 
and to seek support against tragedies and misfortunes. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: This is loyalty and 
faithfulness. Our people, who staged marches in Damascus and all 
the governorates yesterday to mourn the deceased, and who showed 
the greatest images of cohesion and national unity, are the same 
people who pledged allegiance to President al-Asad as a leader 
forever, and adhered to his triumphant march until the full 
liberation of land and the restoration of rights.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 2, INA -- AL-THAWRAH newspaper of 
Baghdad today said the reciprocal obligations of both Iraq and 
the Security Council dictate the immediate shifting to the 
implementation of article 22 of the council Resolution No. 687 
providing for lifting the embargo and allowing Iraq to ensure 
its medicine and food needs. 
  A paper article here today said that any fair observer would 
feel astonished over any attempt to move around this reality 
with the object of procrastination in lifting the embargo or 
employing the sufferings of Iraqi people in cheap compromise and 
blackmail leading to materializing rejected political purposes 
that go contrary to the Iraqis' right in acquiring independent 
well. [sentence as received] 
  The Iraqi paper referring to statements by some on the 
necessity of building confidence and the suspicious calls to 
delay the lifting of the sanctions until the conditions of this 
confidence were established, said that such statements and calls 
fall within manoeuvres of the United States aimed at involving 
others into such designs and preventing them from viewing right 
and maintain them within the aggressive American objectives that 
contradict legitimacy and the principles of right and justice. 
  AL-THAWRAH said that confidence building between Iraq, the 
Security Council and the U.N. Special Committee for the sake of 
ending the injustice sustained by the Iraqi people could be 
reached through an understanding and an objective and fair 
outlook away from all evil purposes and motives. 
  The paper pointed out that that needs from all concerned 
parties recognizing that Iraq had done all what it could to 
realize its obligations and pledges. 
  The Iraqi paper further said that confidence building could 
not be established through manoeuvering or attempts to jump over 
realities or neglecting the sufferings of the Iraqi children, 
women and elderly. This could not also be achieved in lagging 
behind this international party or that who had accepted to 
become false witness in one of unprecedented humanitarian and 
ethical scandals in modern history. 
  AL-THAWRAH concluded by saying that the United States and 
its 
satellites do not want to see realities or to have the embargo 
imposed on Iraq ending and therefore, the Security Council is 
required to take the initiative of implementing its obligations 
and putting an end to this flagrant breaching of all legal, just 
and humanitarian principles.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 2, INA -- AL-JUMHURIYAH daily of 
Baghdad has said that the report of U.S President Bill Clinton 
to the Congress is rife with lies and pre-fabricated tales with 
the aim of keeping the blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  A paper article affirmed that President Clinton had misled 
the supreme legislative authority and pushed it to back up an 
inhumane and unjust policy, entirely intercepting values and 
principles included in the U.S Constitution. This behaviour 
simply contradicts the oath of presidency in which Clinton vowed 
to perform his duties sincerely, the paper said. It added that 
President Clinton had perpetrated the crime of insistence on 
killing thousands of Iraqis through maintaining the blockade for 
longer time. 
  If the Congress is loyal and sincere to the American 
Constitution and its well-known duties, it should underline 
Clinton's premeditation on lie and misleading the American 
public opinion and the Congress and committing the crime of the 
human race annihilation, the paper confirmed. It stressed that 
Clinton's lies were another evidence of his political and moral 
failure and bankruptcy and his weakness and reluctance.

captures a car thief. A responsible source at the Interior 
Ministry told AL-JUMHURIYAH that the president's order covers 
citizens, party organizations, and Internal Security Forces 
personnel who capture car thieves. The source urged police 
departments and party organizations to submit the names of those 
entitled to the award to the Presidential Council after the 
crime of car theft is legally proved. He stressed that this 
noble gesture will effectively contribute toward curbing the 
phenomenon of car theft. He said the award provides an 
incentive for the Internal Security Forces personnel to do 
everything possible to remove this phenomenon.

  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iraqis arriving in 
Amman from Baghdad the night before last have claimed that one 
of President Saddam Husayn's escorts tried to open fire on the 
president but the other escorts killed the escort with a hail of 
machinegun bullets. 
  The Iraqis said that the dead escort, who held the rank of 
captain, came from Tikrit, Saddam's birthplace. 
  The Iraqi president (last summer) himself shot and killed 
his 
escort Mu'ayyad al-'Ayyash because he had informed an Iraqi 
family of a secret place in southern Baghdad in which Saddam was 
present. Al-'Ayyash, too, came from Tikrit and had family ties 
with the president. 
  The Iraqis who spoke about the new attempt believe that it 
occurred less than a month ago just outside Baghdad and that a 
quick reshuffle was made immediately in the protection teams 
assigned to guard the Iraqi president. 
  The most recent report leaked from Baghdad spoke about the 
blowing up of an agricultural tractor on a road through which 
the Iraqi president's motorcade passed on its way to one of his 
bunkers outside the capital. At the time suspicion revolved 
around the president's escorts and senior leaders, who were the 
only ones who had known that the president's motorcade would use 
this country road.

  [Text] On behalf of comrade leader Saddam Husayn, comrade 
Taha Yasin Ramadan, member of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party 
National Command, has decorated several comrade combatants 
affiliated with the security units [himayat] with High Orders of 
Merit in appreciation for their commendable roles in the great 
historic showdown of the eternal Mother of Battles. 
  A ceremony was held on the occasion. It began with Koranic 
recitations, and then the Opening Chapter of the Koran was read 
to invoke God's mercy on the souls of the noblest of all 
creatures, the martyrs of Iraq and the glorious Arab nation. 
  Comrade Taha Yasin Ramadan then delivered a speech. He began 
by conveying the greetings of comrade leader Saddam Husayn to 
those who received the medals. He also conveyed his 
excellency's wishes of continued pride and victory. He added: 
This honoring ceremony crowns the enormous struggle, high 
discipline, and true commitment displayed in your performance of 
holy missions and tasks. 
  Ramadan affirmed that the current phase requires further 
preparedness, continuous training, and constant vigilance, 
because the Mother of Battles is still going on, and also 
because the enemies are using all their cards to undermine the 
willpower and steadfastness of the noble Iraqis, who thwarted 
the most massive aggression and defeated the most ferocious 
embargo enforced by all forces of evil and aggression. 
  Ramadan noted that defending great Iraq by all means is a 
holy duty to be performed by all honorable Iraqis. He asserted 
that the reconstruction drive is a chapter in the 
counteroffensive against the aggressors meant to break the 
unfair embargo imposed on Iraq by the enemies of Arabism and 
mankind in defiance of all heavenly and earthly laws and in 
violation of human rights. 
  The medal-awarding ceremony was attended by several comrade 
members of the National Command and the head of the National 
Command General Secretariat Office.

  [Text] Staff General Husayn Kamil Hasan, minister of 
industry and minerals and supervisor of the Military 
Industrialization Organization [MIO], today inaugurated a plant 
for the production of compressors at the State Enterprise for 
Electrical Industries. The plant has an annual production 
capacity of 500,000 compressors. 
  As he toured the plant's sections, the minister was 
acquainted with the progress of the production operations. He 
gave instructions for increasing production to serve the 
manufacturing of locally-made freezers and refrigerators, of 
which compressors constitute a basic part. 
  Staff Gen. Husayn Kamil Hasan also inaugurated a 
comprehensive irrigation pumps fair at the State Enterprise for 
Mechanical Industries. During a conversation with workers at 
the enterprise, the minister said that the zealous personnel of 
the Ministry of Industry and Minerals, with the effective 
support of the MIO formations, are presenting this 
accomplishment as a gift to the leader of the march, leader 
President Saddam Husayn. He said that after the country's need 
for chemical and phosphatic fertilizers has been fully met in 
the service of the agricultural sector, this distinguished 
effort constitutes a new technological link in defiance of the 
circumstances of the unjust blockade. 
  An Iraqi News Agency correspondent said that the State 
Enterprise for Mechanical Industries has put into action its 
productive plan for this year. This plan aims at producing and 
manufacturing thousands of pumps of various sizes through 100 
percent Iraqi designs, molds, and technological methods.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to a visiting U.S. </F>
delegation of the Hadassah women's movement "this evening;" 
place not given--recorded in English with Arabic subtitles] 
  [Text] We made our decision, we signed the DOP 
[Declaration of Principles]. We are in a process of 
negotiations with the PLO, the Palestinians, about the 
Gaza-Jericho First; first phase, to put it into a test, to see 
what can be done. 
  But, in this agreement, we achieved the following: 
  One, during the period of the interim arrangements, 
Jerusalem 
remains united. We did not succeed to achieve it in Camp David. 
[applause] 
  Second, to remain in all the settlements. And, believe me, 
to my humble opinion, many of them have no justification 
whatsoever. They don't contribute whatsoever to Israel's 
security. Not all of them, a considerable number of them. 
Today, the way that they were established creates a problem to 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the security forces to 
protect the lives of the settlers, because they were not settled 
in a way to protect the life of those who live there. Gush 
Qatif, yes; many others, no. 
  I believe that in 1994 we'll see a year in which decisions 
-- 
and major decisions -- will have to be made. It's a year which 
I believe will serve as a crossroads in which direction 
developments in the Middle East, especially in the context of 
the Arab-Israeli conflict, will go: towards peace or towards 
stalemate, and whatever stalemates have created in the past in 
the region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Busek Inaugurates Professorship"] </F>
  [Text] Jerusalem -- On Wednesday [2 February], during his 
visit to Israel, Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek met with Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin for a talk and for the signing of a 
scientific-technological cooperation agreement. 
  As Vice Chancellor Busek stressed, during the meeting Rabin 
pointed out the "international responsibility for peace in the 
Middle East." The international community, which has called for 
peace for years, must now also participate in the reconstruction 
of the Palestinian territories. 
  In the afternoon Busek inaugurated the 
"Franz-Cardinal-Koenig 
Professorship for Austrian Studies" at the Hebrew University of 
Jerusalem. 
  Previously Busek was the first Austrian politician to lay a 
wreath at the grave of Theodor Herzl, the father of political 
Zionism, and visited the Yad Vashem memorial for the 6 million 
victims of the Holocaust.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says Israel is 
counting on Egyptian authorities to deal with violence by 
militants in that country, and that Jerusalem is not 
recommending that Israelis stay out of Egypt. Egyptian 
militants have warned foreigners to leave the country for their 
own safety, saying the next attacks will be extremely ferocious 
and strong. Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin gave the Israeli 
assessment to reporter Jack Katzenell: 
  [Begin recording] [Beilin] Well, we are of course following 
the situation, but we are sure that the Egyptian Government is 
able to handle this situation and to take care of those 
developments which are, of course, not very positive, but still 
are far from representing the general mood in Egypt. 
  [Katzenell] Do you think that Israelis can still visit 
Egypt, or should still visit Egypt as tourists? 
  [Beilin] We are not calling on Israelis not to visit Egypt.

  [Text] Three Knesset members [MK's] -- Gonen Segev, Ester 
Salmovitz, and Alex Goldfarb -- are seceding from Tzomet and 
setting up a new faction named YA'AD [Independent and Democratic 
Israel]. Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports 
that the three have announced, however, that Tzomet leader 
Refa'el Eytan can acquiesce to their request to suspend the 
party director general and appoint an external auditor to probe 
party affairs by 7 February, when the Knesset House Committee is 
expected to approve their petition to be recognized as an 
independent faction. If he does, they will withdraw their 
secession. They contend that one-third of the Tzomet 
Secretariat will join their move. 
  Eytan's reaction: Segev is gone and good riddance. Now we 
will be able to run the party without intrigue. Eytan will 
convene a news conference in a short while. 
  The three stated that they have not negotiated with anyone 
and that they are busy organizing their new movement. Our 
correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that their faction will qualify 
to receive party funding in the sum of 2 million shekels a year. 
If they join the coalition, they will be eligible for 
ministerial and deputy ministerial posts in accordance with the 
current coalition key. 
  The three seceding MK's today held contacts with Labor MK's; 
it was decided to wait four to six weeks before launching 
negotiations on their joining the coalition. 
  More political reactions: Coalition Chairman Eli Dayan said 
this was an internal affair concerning Tzomet alone, and if the 
three endorse the government guidelines, nothing will prevent 
their joining the coalition. Ran Kohen, chairman of the Meretz 
faction, also called on the three to accept the government 
guidelines and to fight for their missions from within the 
government. 
  Arye Der'i, the SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] chairman, 
said SHAS will not rush to join the coalition if the three 
Tzomet MK's join it. SHAS will return to the coalition only if 
the government is founded on a majority of Jewish MK's, or if 
the implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians is 
guaranteed not to harm the settlers in the territories. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said he will not intervene 
in the internal affairs of other parties, but he regrets any 
rift in the right-wing parties.

  [Text] Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan says he has given the 
party's internal ombudsman the go-ahead to use outside advisers 
to help investigate claims of financial irregularities and 
mismanagement of party affairs. Speaking at a press conference, 
Eytan described Gonen Segev, Ester Salmovitz, and Alex 
Goldfarb's breakaway as an attempt to strengthen their positions 
in the upcoming elections. Eytan said he was not surprised by 
reports of their possible plans to join the coalition. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the Labor party must not 
get involved in the internal political problems of the Tzomet 
party. Speaking to reporters tonight in Jerusalem, Rabin refused 
to say whether he would attempt to entice the three resigning 
members to join the coalition and, in his words, would not 
answer hypothetical questions. 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 
1800 GMT on 2 February adds that Rabin "stated a short time ago 
that he had not authorized anybody to negotiate with the three 
seceding members of Tzomet."]

  [Excerpts] The settlers' operation aimed at doubling the 
number of existing settlements continued this evening. Dozens 
of settlers set up a new outpost near the settlement of Yaqir on 
the trans-Samaria highway. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
1900 GMT on 2 February reports that "the 50 settlers from Yaqir 
who attempted to set up a new settlement on a hill next to their 
settlement left the site after the Army declared the area a 
closed military zone. Our correspondent Dani Gur-Arye reports 
that no confrontation occurred between the soldiers and the 
settlers."] 
  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers said that the operation 
impedes the routine activities of the IDF, which is compelled to 
assign a large number of troops to evacuate the settlers. The 
organizers of the operation, called This Is Our Land, say that 
the operation will continue in all 130 settlements, or until 
50,000 people are arrested. As is known, the leaders of the 
Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza 
object to the operation, but have nevertheless announced they 
will provide legal assistance to settlers who are arrested. 
[passage omitted] 
  The struggle between the official leadership of the settlers 
and activists in the field in fact exists only on paper. This 
week, an attempt will be made to close ranks in anticipation of 
the deployment of Israel Police in the territories in place of 
the IDF. [passage omitted] 
  The IDF announced today that demonstrations by Jews in the 
territories will henceforth be allowed only within the Jewish 
settlements, just as demonstrations by Arabs will be allowed 
only within Arab locations. Our legal affairs correspondent 
Shlomo Arad reports that the High Court of Justice today 
rejected the settlers' request to demonstrate in the synagogue 
in Jericho based on this policy, arguing that the synagogue is 
located in an Arab location and that the court was convinced 
that such a move could imperil security on the site.

  [Text] In Samaria, security forces last night thwarted an 
attempt by Kfar Tapuah settlers to squat in Arab homes in the 
nearby village of Kafr Yusuf, as part of the shadow settlements 
group of the This Is Our Land operation. The area was declared 
a closed military zone and settlers were requested to leave. 
Eleven settlers who refused were taken into custody. A 
spokesman for the This Is Our Land condemned the actions of the 
Kfar Tapuah settlers and said his group's aim was to settle on 
state land, not to take over private Arab homes. 
  The committee of Jordan Valley settlements is planning to 
establish a special patrol unit to be known as the Jordan Valley 
Watch. It will carry out regular patrols in the Jordan Valley, 
including the territorial corridors due under the proposed 
autonomy accord to link Jericho to nearby Muslim and Christian 
holy sites and to the northern Dead Sea area. The spokesman for 
the committee told Qol Yisra'el that the patrols have a 
deterrent purpose and are aimed also to demonstrate an Israeli 
presence on the Jordan Valley roads.

<F P=106> [Report by Judy Maltz] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel might ask the U.S. Administration to 
lift some of the restrictions imposed on the use of the loan 
guarantees because they make it difficult for Jerusalem to use 
the funds. Jerusalem is considering asking the Americans to 
increase the amount that can be included in the state budget to 
be used for investments in infrastructure and to fund the 
internal debt. 
  Within the framework of the loan guarantees agreement, 
Israel 
can use only $600 million annually for those purposes -- less 
than one third of the annual quota. The Americans imposed 
restrictions on the use of the loan guarantees in order to make 
sure that they are not invested in the territories and do not 
fund current expenditures and a rise in the standard of living. 
[passage omitted] 
  The request to change the clauses in the agreement will most 
likely be raised in the next session of the Israeli-U.S. Joint 
Economic Development Group (JEDG) in Washington in March. 
Sources in the Treasury said that U.S. officials are aware of 
the problem created by the restrictions imposed on the use of 
the funds and even support amending the agreement. [passage 
omitted] 
  Another option being considered is to ask the Americans to 
be 
able to use some of the loan guarantees to convert short-term 
foreign debts with long-term debts thereby improving Israel's 
foreign debt situation. [passage omitted]

three men's car at the entrance to Halhul from the direction of

Subaru was later found abandoned in Hebron. The security forces 
have imposed a curfew on the area. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] On the Day of the Wounded and the birthday of 
Abu-al-Fadl al-'Abbas, the Institution of the Oppressed and the 
Wounded of the Islamic Revolution in Lebanon held a ceremony in 
Burj al-Barajinah attended by Hizballah Secretary General Hasan 
Nasrallah; Deputy Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid, leader of the 
parliamentary Faithfulness to the Resistance bloc; Deputies 
al-Hajj 'Ali 'Ammar and al-Hajj Muhammad Barjawi; al-Hajj Husayn 
al-Shami, the official responsible for the central bureau for 
social work; His Eminence Sayyid 'Isa al-Tabataba'i, general 
supervisor of the Islamic Revolution Institutions in Lebanon; 
Muslim scholars; and a crowd of wounded people and their 
families. 
  The Hizballah secretary general delivered a speech, which he 
began by talking about Abu-al-Fadl al-'Abbas, his importance, 
and his relations with Imam al-Husayn. [passage omitted] 
  Addressing those who maintain a good opinion of the 
Americans 
and expect them to do good, he said: "The mujahidin, the 
oppressed, and the Islamic peoples who experienced this regime 
and this administration understand the U.S. position and role in 
dealing with events and developments. A U.S. congressional 
delegation arrived in Lebanon yesterday to collect information 
about missing Israeli soldiers. We regarded this matter and the 
manner in which the delegation entered Lebanon as an insult to 
Lebanon and the Lebanese people. It has come to collect 
information and solve the problem of a small number of Israeli 
soldiers who were killed in Lebanon." 
  His eminence asked: "What were these soldiers doing in 
Lebanon? Were they tourists, diplomats, or merchants? Were they 
not occupation soldiers killing people and attacking and 
destroying the roofs over the heads of women and children?" 
  He said: "These murderers, occupiers, and criminals 
warranted the dispatch of a congressional delegation by their 
American master--a delegation that penetrated barriers to 
collect information about them to reassure their Jewish 
families, while there are hundreds of Lebanese and thousands of 
Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in occupation prisons. 
Everyone knows the extent of suffering, pain, torture, and 
coercion that the prisoners are experiencing. The American 
master does not find any need or reason to visit the Lebanese 
and Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Why?" [passage omitted] 
  His eminence said: "If the United States deals with a purely 
humanitarian issue with such crudeness, unfriendliness, and 
racial discrimination, what can we expect from it on political 
issues and in what affects the future of this area and its 
peoples?" 
  He said: "There are no Arabs, Lebanese, Palestinians, or 
Muslims in the U.S. political view and dictionary. There is 
something called Israel's interests. The United States might 
respect some of the interests of others if that will maintain 
its own interests and achieve the interests of the Israeli 
enemy." [passage omitted] 
  His eminence held the United States fully responsible for 
the 
occupation of Arab territory, imprisonment of people, killing of 
civilians, harming of the wounded, the war and destruction, and 
undermining the political and security situation in this area.

<F P=106> [Article by former Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Subhi </F>
al-Tufayli: "The Geneva Summit and Lebanon `the Happy 
Absentee!'-- The Syrians Avoid the Normalization Pitfall"] 
  [Text] The meeting between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton finally took place in Geneva 
this week. The various attitudes to the meeting depended on 
where one stood. Generally the Arab media welcomed and supported 
the meeting, regarding it as an incomparable achievement in the 
development of Syrian-U.S. ties, the issues under discussions, 
and the Syrian- Zionist negotiations. 
  It is clear that the Geneva meeting laid the foundations of 
better ties between the United States and Syria. Their interest 
in promoting bilateral ties was clearly demonstrated by the 
instructions given to the two countries' foreign ministers to 
handle unresolved issues between them in a detailed and open 
manner, as Clinton put it. 
  Syria's regional role in a political settlement was 
recognized, in Clinton's own words. Clinton said: There will 
be no comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless he (Hafiz 
al-Asad) is willing to assume a leading role. The Syrians 
maintained that they elicited an acknowledgement, spelled out by 
Clinton, of certain points that had been disputed for some time. 
These included the following: The Americans committed 
themselves to a "full peace plan" based on UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and on the land-for-peace principle, 
which practically means accepting the Syrian viewpoint on the 
negotiations. 
  The Syrians are seeking to draw up an agreement that would 
enable them to avoid normalization entailing diplomatic, trade, 
and cultural ties. They have bolstered their position by 
pointing to several examples, including the failure of a similar 
agreement with Egypt--the Egyptian regime failed to fulfill its 
normalization commitments despite numerous attempts because the 
Egyptian public was strongly against normalization. The Syrians 
also explained that their country's special situation cannot 
tolerate normalization. 
  The speech that President al-Asad made in Geneva included a 
clear remark about this: "Hundreds of thousands have sacrificed 
their lives to defend the homeland and uphold its rights. 
There's hardly a house in Syria that did not offer a martyr who 
fell in the defense of the Arab nation and its rights." 
  It was as if al-Asad was saying a river of blood exists in 
Syria, in addition to the Euphrates, over which one cannot 
easily jump. 
  If the Syrians succeed in their effort to draw up a new 
formula for a solution with the Zionist entity, we will have two 
types of settlements in the region: one that opens the doors 
wide for all forms of relations and alliances and another that 
ends the state of war but keeps all doors closed. This latter 
type will allow many regional countries to adopt the Syrian 
concept of a political settlement. Meanwhile, the Zionists and 
Americans are trying to open all Arab doors to all forms of 
normalization. To the Zionist entity normalization is a primary 
condition and on its basis the "Camp David" accord, the 
"Gaza-Jericho" agreement, the draft agreement with the 
Jordanians, and the 17 May Accord [of 1983 with Lebanon, later 
abrogated] were concluded. 
  The ongoing negotiations with many Arab countries 
presuppose acceptance of the Zionist entity's concept of a 
settlement. Acting according to the Syrian concept of a 
settlement will damage, even if relatively, the Zionist plans in 
the region and relations with some Arab countries and will delay 
some of the normalization plans for years to come. This might 
lay the basis for developments and events that do not serve the 
U.S.-Zionist hegemony plan. It also explains the U.S. and 
Zionist insistence on normalization. 
  This became evident in the speech that former U.S. President 
Bush delivered at the Madrid conference, when he stressed that 
the U.S. concept of a settlement is based on diplomatic, 
economic, cultural, media, tourism, and development relations. 
The enemy's prime minister followed him in stressing this 
concept. This explains the relatively cool reaction in 
Palestine to the Geneva summit and the Israelis' demand to hear 
the Syrian president's unequivocal support for normalization. 
The word "peace" voiced by the Syrian president in Geneva is 
not enough. 
  This means (despite the strong optimism about the 
possibility 
of reaching quick results from the negotiations) that it is 
difficult to accept the Syrian concept of a settlement despite 
the tottering of the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement and the dependence 
of the Jordanian and Lebanese signatures on the Syrian one. 
Yet, according to observers' expectations, these rounds of 
negotiations should result in a solution to the problem. 
Lebanon is the major absentee, despite the utterances of joy 
and delight expressed by officials through the media. The U.S. 
President, who was keen not to leave the mistaken impression of 
being against President al-Asad, who agreed with his concept of 
"peace" and "Lebanon's future," did not want to touch on many 
issues. He made it clear in his speech that Lebanon has no 
place in the U.S. Administration's thinking. Overall U.S. 
practices and the way it is handling the Middle East problem and 
the negotiations indicate that this is the case. 
  President al-Asad's reference to Resolution 425 does not 
change the picture at all. This is another stigma added to the 
Lebanese regime's black record. This regime appears to have 
undertaken the task of going down with the same speed that the 
resistance in Lebanon is rising. The brighter the resistance 
and the mujahidin become and the more they light the nation's 
path, the more the regime gets immersed in the darkened dens of 
vice, as if this regime's men without hesitation yielded to the 
power of the Jews and their masters who are imposing their 
hegemony on many ruling regimes in the world. They have 
accepted this new master as their god to pray to and entreat. 
They are accompanied in this by a vociferous media that is in 
control of the masses and is bewitching many to the extent that 
one starts to believe that apostasy is going to live forever and 
that Islam, the resistance men, and all the honest people are on 
their way out. 
  We would like here to recall the firm and decisive divine 
pledge that was mentioned in the Holy Koran and the Prophet's 
traditions, which emphasizes that the battle between Muslims and 
Jews is continuing, that there is no peace and no conciliation 
[la salam wa la sulh] with them, that the charters and treaties 
will not live, and that the mujahidin will enter (the temple, as 
they entered it before, and to visit with destruction all that 
fell into their power) [Koranic verse].

  [Text] Kabul, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Afghan President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani met with the head of a 56-member peace delegation here 
Thursday, although the results of the talks are not yet known, 
official sources said. 
  Jallaluddin Haqani, a respected mojahedin commander from 
eastern Paktiya province, had arrived in the capital to attempt 
to bring an end to the Afghan factional fighting, now in its 
34th consecutive day, they said. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said Haqani, who has set up a 
base 
at a military installation near Pul-e Charkhi, some five 
kilometres (three miles) east of here, sent a represenative to 
meet Rabbani but other sources say he came in person. 
  It is understood that Haqani has already met with Rabbani's 
rival Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, who is allied with 
former communist militia General Abdol Rashid Dostum. 
  Hekmatyar is demanding the resignation of Rabbani and the 
setting up of an interim government to administer general 
elections, while Rabbani has so far refused talks with Hekmatyar 
so long as he continues his alliance with Dostum. 
  The talks here were not marred by shelling as both sides by 
and large held their fire Thursday, allowing civilians to move 
in large numbers on the streets. 
  A brief burst of small-arms fire in the old city Jadayi 
Maiwand bazaar sent civlians running for cover just before noon 
but in the adjacent Mandayi bazaar, which is the main depot for 
consumer supplies for all minor Kabul markets, there was a brisk 
trade in items like tea, sugar, dried fruits, batteries and 
cigarettes. 
  Meanwhile a five-truck relief convoy of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) arrived in the capital 
carrying nearly 17 tonnes of wheat-flour for distribution to the 
homeless on both sides of the eastern Kabul frontlines.

  [Text] Afghan warring factions have agreed to declare 
Jalalabad a safe haven, at the instance of Pakistan. A Foreign 
Office spokesman told newsmen in Islamabad today, that the 
agreement came after meetings separately of Pakistan's charge 
d'affaires in Kabul with President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime 
Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. He said there has also been a 
positive response from General 'Abdorrahim [as heard] Dostam, 
when the acting consul general of Pakistan contacted him at 
Mazar-e Sharif. 
  The spokesman said Pakistan would continue to provide 
humanitarian relief to the displaced people at Jalalabad. He 
said Pakistan was pressing all parties to the conflict to accept 
a cease- fire. 
  On the other hand, the 100-member Jalalabad mediation team, 
which arrived in Pol-e Charkhi near Kabul last night, has 
started informal contacts with leaders of the warring factions, 
to prepare the groundwork for negotiations. 
  Meanwhile a rocket and heavy artillery exchange rocked the 
Afghan capital for more than an hour today. Forces opposing the 
government attacked Kabul's [word indistinct] Wazir Akbar Khan 
district with rockets. The pro-government batteries retaliated 
for more than an a hour.

  [Text] The Afghan opposition coordination council 
announced: After a call by the United Nations, opposition forces 
have agreed to a four-day conditional cease-fire. This is when 
warring groups in Afghanistan have also agreed to set Jalalabad 
as a secure area. Here is our colleague, Khameneh, in Pakistan 
with a report: 
  [Khameneh] The leaders of the warring groups in Kabul have 
agreed to declare Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, as a secure 
area where clashes and military operations will be avoided. 
  The Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and the Prime 
Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, in separate meetings with the 
Pakistani Charge d'affaires in the last 48 hours, have shown a 
positive reaction to a call by Pakistan for declaring Jalalabad 
as a secure area. A spokesman for the Pakistani Ministry for 
Foreign Affairs, in a news conference this evening, announcing 
this, added: The acting Pakistani consul in Mazar-e Sharif, 
also, in a meeting with General Dostam has received a similar 
response to the call. 
  After recent clashes among rival groups in Kabul, which 
began 
33 days ago, about 80,000 out of 250,000 Afghan refugees have 
sought refuge in Jalalabad and its suburbs. Pakistan's efforts 
to declare Jalalabad as a secure area can be construed as a 
restraining act toward Afghan refugees entering Pakistani soil. 
During the first 10 days of fighting in Kabul, about 17,000 new 
Afghan refugees entered Pakistan and eventually, some three 
weeks ago, Islamabad banned Afghan nationals from entering that 
country without a valid visa.

  [Text] Dhaka, Jan 31 (AFP) -- At least six people were 
killed and 30 others injured Monday when an opposition Awami 
League (AL) procession was fired on by unidentified gunmen, 
pushing the toll to seven in election violence, police and 
witnesses said. 
  Gunmen opened fire on the supporters of AL mayoral candidate 
Mohammad Hanif, who is leading in the weekend polls, in the 
Lalbagh area, killing six instantly. Several of the injured were 
in critical condition. 
  "We do not have any details on who fired," one police 
officer 
at the Lalbagh police station said. 
  The injured were being treated at a local hospital. 
  During Sunday's first ever mayoral and city commissioner 
elections, one school boy was killed and more than 200 were 
injured in sporadic clashes between rival groups. 
  Hanif is leading with a wide margin against Prime Minister 
Khaleda Zia's ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) nominee 
Mirza Abbas in Dhaka, while another AL candidate, Mohiuddin 
Chowdhury, has won in the port city of Chittagong, according to 
preliminary election commission results. 
  But the BNP clinched victory in the cities of Khulna and 
Rajshahi. 
  The elections are seen here as the first popularity test of 
the two main political groups, and political analysts said the 
AL sees the municipal vote as a way of rebuilding its strength 
in crucial urban areas before the 1996 national polls, after 
losing all eight Dhaka seats and most of the other urban seats 
to the BNP in the 1991 parliamentary election.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "President Clinton's Speech] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton in his address to the joint 
session of the U.S. Congress last Tuesday [January 25] apprised 
the people of his country about the programs he implemented 
during the past year and gave hints about his future course of 
action. He praised the Congress for approving his proposals for 
reducing the budgetary deficit, adopting legislation relating to 
the ownership of guns, and approving the NAFTA trade accord. 
President Clinton took these measures after assuming office. 
But the question remains as to how successful has he been in 
implementing his election promises, which included ensuring the 
welfare of the people, increasing health care facilities, 
creating new job opportunities, and developing the economy. In 
this regard there is mixed opinion. The opponents of President 
Clinton say that he has not be able to achieve any remarkable 
success in fulfilling his election promises. On the other hand, 
his party and supporters are more or less satisfied with his 
actions and and successes. The Clinton administration has been 
successful to some extent in increasing employment 
opportunities. The President has stated that the rise in 
employment opportunities during his term of office was much more 
in comparison with the past four years. The health reform 
measures taken by President Clinton have been criticized by 
members of both parties. People are not very optimistic about 
the success of his moves to improve social welfare services and 
develop the economy. 
  In his speech, President Clinton gave special emphasis to 
issues relating to the improvement of health care facilities, 
reforming social welfare services, reducing crime, and 
developing the economy. He acknowledged that a lot more has to 
be done for the welfare of the people. The President said that 
the employment level is still unsatisfactory, a lot of violence 
took place during this period, and there is a lack of optimism 
in many areas. He further said that social welfare measures 
will be reformed to reduce the dependence of people on 
government allowances and to find jobs for them. The President 
reiterated his pledge to guarantee health care. He also pledged 
to formulate stringent laws to curb crime and added that more 
police will be deployed. Life imprisonment will be sentenced for 
persons involved in more than one crime. He also reiterated his 
pledge to boost the economy and said that he will present a 
tough budget next year. Dwelling on foreign policy, President 
Clinton emphasized the need to further strengthen ties with the 
allies of the United States. He further stated that support for 
the new democratic states and the economic reforms in Russia 
will continue. 
  The U.S. citizens voted for Bill Clinton with great 
expectations for changes for a better life. Such large-scale 
changes cannot be expected within the short span of one year. 
It is not difficult to initiate the process of change. At this 
moment, it is not possible to ascertain how much successl 
Clinton has had in changing the fortunes of the American people 
during his one year in office. This much can be said: Clinton 
is making efforts to abide by his pledges. He has successes and 
failures. During this period, the United States faced disaster 
and crisis on various fronts. Repeated natural disasters have 
become a cause of concern. In these natural calamities, 
property worth several thousand dollars has been destroyed. 
This will have an adverse effect on the economy. The setbacks 
suffered by President Clinton in foreign policy cannot be 
overlooked. U.S. policy failed in various countries, including 
Bosnia, Somalia, North Korea, Pakistan, and China. It is 
natural that the effects of these failures will be reflected on 
the domestic front. If all factors are taken into 
consideration, it could be said that the United States will face 
harder days ahead. Hence, President Clinton, the U.S. 
Administration, and the people should display more patience, 
tolerance, farsightedness, and judiciousness.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Cockpit of Intrigues"] </F>
  [Text] President Clinton is fast gaining recognition as 
the patron-in-chief of secessionists of South Asia. After his 
recent gesture to Ghulam Nabi Fai, chief of one of the 
Pakistan-funded outfit of Kashmiri separatists in the US, it has 
now been disclosed by the US-based Council of Khalistan that 
Clinton has also expressed his concern for "Sikh rights" in 
Punjab. He has done so in a letter to Congressman Gary A. Condit 
who had drawn the former's attention to "the crisis in 
Khalistan." The mischief is writ large on statements both by 
Condit and Aulakh, the leader of the Sikh separatists. Yet, the 
State Department would have us believe that the letter was 
written to Condit only by way of courtesy -- a letter in which 
Clinton refers to Punjab as though it were the 51st state of the 
US. In doing so, the Department has conveniently tried to divert 
attention from the clear prospect of an early end to the 
prolonged campaign of brutal murders in Punjab, from the 
establishment of an elected government and from increasing signs 
of normalcy there. This happy turn of events should have 
gladdened the hearts of Americans whose government has 
repeatedly professed to come down heavily on international 
terrorism. But Clinton's administration has deemed it more 
important to warm the cockles of the hearts of foreign-based 
chiefs of separatist organisations who have been demoralised by 
the rapid restoration of peace in Punjab. 
  Secessionists of every kind have good reason to think that 
Clinton and his buddies in the White House are there to ensure 
that they all will remain in business. They have discovered that 
they only need to pose as great champions of human rights to 
enlist Clinton's sympathy. In fact many worthies of the 
under-world around the world may take the cue from the American 
lobbyists for secessionism-cum-terrorism or their agents 
entrenched in present-day White House. The bulk of Clinton's 
staff seems to be preoccupied with salvaging his reputation in 
the wake of his and his wife's alleged malfeasance during his 
tenure as Governor of Arkansas. This may be one reason why 
lobbies working for dubious causes, apparently find "human 
rights" a magic formula to manipulate the White House. 
  Washington, in fact, is likely to become famous less as a 
capital of think-tanks than as the key nerve-centre of 
specialists in political destabilisation in the third world. 
What a parody of the world leadership of the unchallenged 
superpower! The CIA, the great expert in subversion, has nursed 
Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] which has now taken 
over as the arch-stabiliser in South Asia. Clinton's touching 
concern for the feelings of American lobbyists for Pakistan's 
proteges among the Kashmiri and Punjabi separatists is apt to 
make ISI happy. It can count on its traditional links with the 
Pentagon being reinforced by a cooperative bureaucracy running 
the White House. Anyone can now get any dirty work done through 
Clinton's close aides just by chanting the mantra of human 
rights.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Sombre Context"] </F>
  [Text] The republic enters its 45th year at a time of 
disquieting uncertainty in the rest of the world. If, in the 
past, the compulsions of the cold war created many a hurdle in 
the consolidation of freedom won by the third world countries, 
the transition to a new international world order has also not 
freed them from all anxiety about their future. This is a time 
not just of promise but also of potential pitfalls. It is in 
this sombre background that President Shanker Dayal Sharma has 
found it necessary to sound a note of caution. In his Republic 
Day message to the nation, he has referred to the danger of 
foreign interference in India's internal affairs. He has clearly 
in mind not merely the continuing sustenance of terrorism in 
Kashmir by Pakistan and evidence of a foreign hand in insurgent 
activity in the north-east but also instances of US-based 
terrorist outfits being blessed with words of solace from the 
White House itself. It may not be a deliberate policy of the US 
to promote destabilisation in India. But New Delhi cannot be 
indifferent to the disturbing fact that separatists have found 
it easy to maintain a channel of communication with President 
Clinton's aides. They have played on the American concern for 
human rights for their own nefarious purposes. White House 
officials have refused to be wary of the way they are allowing 
themselves to be manipulated to harm India's interests. 
  This suggests a continuation of the essence of the 
four-decades- old American policy towards Indo-Pakistan 
problems. In the past it consisted of humouring Pakistan just 
because the latter helped strengthen the American anti-Soviet 
strategy. Even if, in recent years, Washington has claimed to 
have been guided by a so-called evenhanded approach to this 
subcontinent, its practice has not ceased to be overly 
influenced by a sympathetic view of Pakistan's causes. The 
Pressler amendment, as the name itself signifies, was not the 
result of the administration's initiative. The administration 
has actually found it an inconvenient constraint. American 
praise for the democratic system in India from time to time 
cannot blind its policy-makers to the constant threat of its 
interests being compromised by the instinctive American habit of 
tilting towards Pakistan on all contentious issues. 
  The best way of countering this threat would certainly be to 
invest Indian diplomacy with some punch. The traditional way of 
trying to convince others of the justness of any Indian cause 
will not suffice. Every time the Americans say or do things 
which palpably go against this country's interests, no punches 
should be pulled in exposing their mischief. This style, sadly, 
is still alien to Indian diplomacy as was amply clear from the 
defensive ring of protests against the latest anti-Indian 
manoeuvres in the White House.

<F P=106> [By Bhabani Sen Gupta] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Institute of Peace's [USIP] second dialogue 
on Kashmir perhaps signals a change in American perspectives of 
the conflict. The second dialogue was held in January 1994 
almost exactly a year after the first one. As in the first 
dialogue, for the second dialogue too the U.S. Institute of 
Peace brought together for three days some 15 unofficial people 
from India and Pakistan among whom there were four Kashmiris 
from the two parts of the State. 
  The framework of the January 1993 dialogue was open-ended. 
It gave the impression that the U.S. was probing, if not 
promoting, the possibilities of an independent Kashmir, its 
security and autonomy jointly guaranteed by India and Pakistan. 
This impression was fortified in the subcontinent by the 
diplomacy of Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of State for 
South Asia, who added an edge to the conflict with her statement 
that the "entire State of Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed 
territory" and the accession of the State to India in 1948 did 
not change that position. The "concept paper" drawn up by the 
USIP for the January 1994 dialogue did reiterate that the 
"final disposition" of the territory of the State was still in 
dispute; however, it also made it clear that a resolution of the 
conflict in Kashmir could be attempted only within the existing 
political framework of the subcontinent. This important premise 
lent an air of reality to the discussions and promoted joint 
quests for ways out of the expensive bloody insurgency that has 
been savaging the Kashmir Valley since December 1989. 
  The USIP framework paper made several other points that were 
both realistic and constructive. First, the conflict could be 
resolved only "over time" and "step by step" through a peace 
process that was still to be introduced. Secondly, the gradual, 
incremental peace process must start with a significant 
reduction in the volume of violence. Several measures were 
needed for this constructive opening of a peace process, and 
these had to be taken both by the governments in Delhi and 
Islamabad and the Kashmiri militants. The USIP document 
suggested that the militants take the first step with a 
unilateral ceasefire and that the Indian government respond to 
it with a strong and generous reciprocity in the form of 
releasing political prisoners, a thinning out of security 
forces, gradually handing over the charge of maintaining law and 
order to the State police and stopping all custodial deaths. In 
between these measures by the two sides to the conflict in the 
Indian part of the State, Pakistan stops all material aid to 
the militants. Violence must be ended as quickly as possible 
without weakening the security of the State. 
  The participants agreed that the Kashmir issue had undergone 
a "significant" change with the outbreak of insurgency and 
Pakistan's involvement in it. The issue is no longer of 
exclusive domain of India and Pakistan or India and the people 
of the Kashmir Valley. In the new situation, "it is essential 
that the people of Kashmir are central actors" in a political 
process of conflict resolution "along with the governments and 
citizens of India and Pakistan". Implied in the foregoing 
sentence is recognition of three elements that make the Kashmir 
issue significantly different today from what it had been in the 
past. The conference document recognised that the Kashmiri 
people cannot be a single actor, because of the ethnic plurality 
of the population and its political division of the last four 
decades. There was also recognition of the fact that the 
conflict in Kashmir had to be resolved at several levels, each 
interacting with the other. This makes the peace process 
extremely difficult to build, and an eventual solution more 
complex than in the past. The two channels of dialogues as a 
prelude to negotiations link the governments of India and 
Pakistan on the one hand and the Indian government and the 
militants of the Valley on the other. In view of the emotional 
overloading of the Kashmir issue in both Pakistan and India, 
which makes it difficult for political leaderships to take 
initiatives that could run counter to widely held popular 
positions, unofficials have a role to play in bridging the gaps 
between the two governments. 
  There are several channels of unofficial dialogues between 
Pakistan and India but none whatsoever between Indians and the 
militants of the Kashmir Valley. This is particularly 
unfortunate. To be sure, individual Indians outside the 
government, especially those working in the field of human 
rights and civil liberties, travel to Srinagar and meet with 
militant leaders or cadres individually or in small groups. 
What does not happen is an open-ended dialogue between Indian 
who can influence government policies and leaders of 
representatives of the militants. The USIP provides an 
opportunity once a year for several Indians to meet with a 
couple or so of Kashmiris who are in contact with the militants 
and can speak their minds with a certain credibility. The USIP 
conference also provides Indians with an opportunity to meet a 
couple of persons from Pakistan held Kashmir, and Pakistanis to 
converse with Kashmiris from the Indian part of the State. 
However, two meetings are nearly not enough to bind the 
participants in silken bonds of trust and confidence so that 
they can speak with openness and candour and do not have to 
repeat the "national" scripts. Especially when the participants 
change from one conference to the next. Only three of the 
Indians who joined the 1994 dialogue had attended the dialogue 
of the previous January. It was the same with participants from 
Pakistan. But why must Indians depend on an American 
institution to come face to face with spokesmen of the militants 
in their own part of the State of Jammu and Kashmir which they 
regard as an integral part of their country? 
  Indian academic and other bodies must be able to bring 
together for a free exchange of views numbers [as published] of 
unofficial Indians and representatives of militants in Kashmir. 
If the militant bodies are in no mood to come to Delhi, a 
dialogue can be organised in Kathmandu. 
  India and Pakistan cannot isolate themselves from the impact 
of the end of apartheid in South Africa, the Middle East peace 
process, the Anglo-Irish accord to resolve the 200 year-old 
conflict over Northern Ireland. Ms. Benazir Bhutto could not 
persuade the leaders of China to support the Kashmiri people's 
right to self- determination. India may be able to "live with" 
resolutions adopted at the UN or elsewhere criticising its human 
rights record in Kashmir. How long can it be indifferent to the 
status damage it suffers as a result of the continuing 
bloodletting in Kashmir? How long will it take the rulers of 
India to realise how the Kashmir conflict is gradually 
militarising Indian polity and undermining Indian democracy? 
  The full-scale civil war in Afghanistan cautions external 
powers like the United States against the breakdown of political 
systems anywhere in South and Central Asia. Some militant 
groups in Kashmir talk openly about the establishment of a 
Caliphate spawning Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kashmir and the 
Islamic republics of Central Asia. This Caliphate concept is 
nourished by some of the fundamentalist groups fighting amongst 
themselves in Afghanistan. At the Washington meeting on Kashmir, 
the danger of reducing the State of Jammu and Kashmir to another 
Afghanistan was brought to the notice of all participants. This 
danger appears to be one of the factors that have prompted the 
USIP to suggest a resolution of the Kashmir conflict within the 
prevailing political framework in South Asia. India has a 
window of opportunity to bring the conflict under control and 
then translate it into a peace process. For this a number of 
unilateral initiatives on the part of the prime minister should 
be extremely effective. 
  A short ceasefire will not cost India a tuppence but may 
gain 
it a lot. The release of several hundred political prisoners 
will be another similar gesture of peace. An envoy of the prime 
minister could then conduct confidential negotiations with the 
All Parties Huriyat Conference. To encourage a dialogue, the 
Kashmir police could be given greater law and order 
responsibility in areas where it can function effectively. At 
another, simultaneous level the talks with the Pakistan 
government need to be pursued with increasing seriousness of 
purpose. The aim should be to conclude a basket of accords 
easing the much-flawed relationship towards normalisation.

  [Excerpts] The news of the shooting incident at the 
immaculate mausoleum of Imam Khomeyni, may God be pleased with 
him, on the first day of the glorious celebration of the 10 Days 
of Dawn of the Islamic revolution while the beloved president of 
the nation was making a speech, immediately caused a wave of 
concern among the faithful people of Islamic Iran. [passage 
omitted] 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani is the comrade-in-arms of the eminent 
leader of the revolution and reminds us of the late imam. That 
is why that prominent revolutionary figure has always been the 
target of the enemies of the revolution in various forms. Today 
the enemy is focusing all its efforts on dealing blows against 
the holy system of the Islamic revolution and weakening the 
presence of the people in the arenas of the defense of the 
revolution. 
  The attempts to instill despair in the people, propagated in 
the past few months by the horns of world arrogance and 
international Zionism and spread in the society in various 
forms, contained the message that the enemies of the revolution 
are hatching an extensive plot to deal blows at the revolution 
and its foundations. 
  The incitement to revolt by certain saboteurs in Zahedan, 
which took place at the same time as the anti-revolutionary move 
at the immaculate mausoleum of Imam Khomeyni, may God be pleased 
with him, cannot be a coincidence. Such incidents can only be 
the work of organizations such as CIA and Mosad. They are the 
ones who, from the first day of the victory of the Islamic 
revolution, have girded their loins to destroy the Islamic 
revolution. But thanks to Almighty God, since the Islamic 
revolution and its movement has enjoyed divine support, once 
again the efforts of the conspirators failed and the leader and 
the ummah were joyful to hear that the beloved president is 
safe. The shouts of greetings to Hashemi were the people's 
crushing response to those who hatched that evil plot. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] A few minutes ago, in an interview with the Central 
News Unit, one of the commanders of the security forces provided 
new details on the conspiracy involving an assassination attempt 
on the life of the president and the blows struck at the Islamic 
system by foreign affiliated counterrevolutionaries. Please pay 
attention to this interview: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] General, 
please tell our listeners about the latest investigations 
carried out and the information available on the attempt on the 
life of Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the president of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. 
  [Unidentified security forces officer] In the name of God, 
the compassionate, the merciful. First let me express my most 
sincere congratulations to the martyr-nurturing ummah and the 
esteemed leader of the Islamic revolution on the 15th 
anniversary of the dawn of the Islamic revolution, thanks be to 
God. In less than three days after the incident, new dimensions 
of the assassination attempt against the esteemed president have 
been revealed. 
  The assailant, who was an individual of corrupt morals, and 
his corrupt collaborators, who had committed many immoral acts 
as well as drug addiction and who were intent on the 
assassination of the president, were all arrested. The 
assailant and his collaborators had taken part in Friday prayers 
in Tehran on a number of occasions for this very purpose -- to 
carry out their evil deed there. However, as the result of the 
vigilance of the Hezbollahi ummah and the implementation of 
security checks, they had not been able to carry out their evil 
plan there. Therefore, they made use of the great gathering of 
the people on 1 February, the anniversary of the first day of 
the Ten Days of Dawn, and of the presence of the esteemed 
president at those ceremonies, which had been announced in 
advance. 
  The assailant and one of his collaborators had entered the 
pure shrine of Imam Khomeyni, may God's blessings be upon him, 
in order to implement their plan. They then carried out the 
plot which everyone knows about. That man, who is a member of 
one of the anti- Islamic and antirevolutionary grouplets, and 
all the other members of the group who have been arrested, are 
completely against Islamic principles and the Islamic 
revolution. By firing a few shots in the direction of the 
podium, he was trying to carry out the plot, but thanks be to 
God, as the result of the vigilance, wrathful onslaught, and 
fast reaction of the Hezbollahi ummah the shots did not hit the 
target and the assailant was arrested by the people and handed 
over. 
  [Correspondent] General: We have heard in the news that the 
assassination attempt was premeditated and there is evidence of 
the involvement of foreign agents. Could you tell us some more 
about this, please? 
  [Security forces officer] Praise be to God and thanks to 
divine mercy, in the wake of precise intelligence work and the 
confessions of the assailant, all his accomplices and the 
planners of this disgraceful action have been arrested. All the 
evidence, files, and confessions indicate that the conspiracy 
was fully planned. There is other information on the next 
question you asked; however, for the time being, in order to 
safeguard the secrets of Hezbollahi ummah and for the sake of 
security expediency, we regret we cannot divulge them. God 
willing the martyr-rearing nation will be informed by us of the 
conclusive reports in the near future. [end recording]

  [Text] Once again, the enemies of the Islamic revolution 
have embarked on a feeble attempt to overshadow the splendor 
and greatness of the Ten Days of Dawn ceremonies and the 
glorious presence of the Muslim nation of Iran in the defense of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. This time their criminal hands 
moved with the evil intention of attempting the assassination of 
the nation's loved one and the peerless companion of the leader, 
the popular president, in the sanctuary of the sacred tomb of 
the beloved Imam. Since the revolution and its move are 
divinely supported and guaranteed by the Imam of the Age, may 
God expedite his advent, by God's grace and power, once again 
the efforts of the conspirators were ineffective, and shouts of 
greetings to Hashemi and death to the hypocrites were the 
nation's crushing reply to that incident. 
  The Muslim nation of Iran will hold prayer services in all 
the mosques after tomorrow night's evening prayers as 
thanksgiving for the wellbeing of their beloved president, as 
well as to ask for a long life for the exalted leader of the 
Islamic revolution.

  [Text] Zahedan, Feb. 1, IRNA -- With the awareness of the 
revolutionary and Muslim people of Zahedan, the conspiracy of 
the anti-revolutionaries who created a disturbance here today on 
Khayyam avenue was nullified. 
  The shopkeepers and the people of Khayyam Avenue confronted 
and fought with the anti-revolutionaries who broke windows, tore 
Iranian flags and attacked shops and storefronts. 
  "Those who are hired by the foreigners are trying in vain to 
create a scene to make the active presence of the people look 
pale in the ten-day dawn festivities," said Pir Muhammad Abu 
Bakr, who fought against the anti-revolutionaries. 
  Despite the nuisance, the people of Zahedan here today 
attended a grand ceremony at the 17th of Shahrivar Stadium to 
comemmorate the victory of the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

  [Text] The president has described the esteemed families of 
the martyrs and devotees as the greatest and strongest 
foundations of the Islamic revolution, safeguarding the gains of 
this sacred divine system. He added: The presence of these dear 
ones in society and in various arenas of the Islamic revolution 
act as an inspiration to the people and contribute toward 
reconstruction. He went on: The esteemed families of the 
martyrs, the devotees, and the war-disabled are regarded as a 
vast network, which protect the Islamic revolution and its holy 
and remarkable gains in society. 
  Speaking today on the third day of the auspicious occasion 
of 
the Ten Days of Dawn, which is named the day of devotion and 
martyrdom, and addressing families who have donated more than 
one martyr, the president went on: You have voluntarily given 
your dearest assets -- that is, your sons -- to be martyred for 
the path of God. You are, thus, the best examples of devotion 
and self-sacrifice. You have proved that nothing is more dear 
to you than the path of the Islamic revolution and the line of 
his eminence the imam, may God be satisfied with his deeds. 
  He added: Thanks to the strength given to the Islamic 
revolution by the martyrs, the devotees, and their families, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran is stronger and more stable than any 
other regime in the world, despite today's seditious world and 
despite so much resentment and hostility against us. Since the 
families of the martyrs are continuing the path pursued by their 
dear ones, this system's stability will increase daily. 
  Referring to the fact that the Islamic revolution of Iran 
has 
its roots in the hearts of all the members of society and other 
Muslim and deprived nations of the world, the president said: 
This revolution is not dependent upon individuals. Those who 
think that by eliminating certain individuals they can deliver 
blows to the revolution are mistaken; in the same way that after 
the passing of his eminence the imam, God's blessings be upon 
him, which was a great loss for the nation, the esteemed leader, 
Khamene'i, as a wise and aware leader took the reins of the 
leadership of this divine nation and decisively and vigorously 
continues the path and holy aspirations of the founder of the 
Islamic Republic. 
  He added: As a servant, I always feel indebted to the 
nobility, dignity, and the comprehensive participation of all 
the members of the public in all the stages of the Islamic 
revolution, especially the esteemed families of the martyrs, 
those missing in action, and the disabled. I hope that in the 
future I will be able to exert more efforts in helping these 
people. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: God has provided the 
leadership 
of the revolution and the steadfastness and self-sacrifice of 
the Iranian people as proofs and guiding lights for history and 
for those who come after us, so that the people of the world may 
see God's will with their own eyes and can use it as a model. 
  The president said: Negative propaganda and the expanding 
nature of the animosity and hatred of world arrogance toward the 
Islamic revolution have further strengthened and consolidated it 
inside the country, have encouraged the onlookers outside to 
make further studies of the amazing dimensions of this historic 
phenomenon of the present age, and have forced them to review 
their negative assessment of the Islamic revolution. 
  Praising the sublime status of the martyrs, those missing in 
action, and the disabled, and the patience and dignity of the 
members of their honorable families, the president said that by 
keeping alive the memory of the epic deeds of those beloved ones 
we will be able to awaken pure consciences. He said: Those 
acts of self-sacrifice have ensured the future of the revolution 
and the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The fruits of 
their self- sacrifice have made it possible that, alongside the 
efforts for reconstructing and strengthening the economic health 
of the country, the spiritual foundations of the society will 
also be further strengthened. 
  According to the Central News Unit report, at the beginning 
of this meeting, which was also attended by the families of the 
martyrs of the presidency [as heard], Hojjat ol-Eslam 
val-Moslemin Rahimian, the representative of the vali-ye faqih 
and the head of the Martyrs Foundation, made a short speech in 
which he expressed his gratitude for God's grace and blessings 
in removing the danger to the life of the president. Amidst the 
crushing slogans of the families of martyrs condemning the 
conspiracies of the enemies and prayers for the health and 
well-being of the president, Rahimian said: The esteemed 
members of the families of martyrs and the disabled, through 
their dignity, piety, and detachment are trying to have an 
active presence and participation during the period of the 
reconstruction of the country, as they did during the period of 
the holy defense, Iran-Iraq war. 
  In these ceremonies, some of the children of the martyrs 
chanted revolutionary songs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Security Agreement Between </F>
Turkey and Israel"] 
  [Text] In a statement to the Zionist newspaper YEDI'OT 
AHARONOT last week, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said: We 
support the concept of Turkey's strategic cooperation with 
Israel against terrorism and we do not hide the fact that we 
cooperate with Israel against the Hizbullah in Lebanon. We are 
not worried in any way. 
  Meanwhile, President Ezer Weizman said in Turkey: Israel is 
prepared to exchange information with Turkey on matters related 
to the struggle against terrorism. 
  Turkey and Israel have maintained relations since the 
occupation of Palestine in 1948. Ankara's relations with the 
Zionist regime improved further after the PLO concluded an 
agreement with Tel Aviv and autonomous status was given to Gaza 
and Eriha [Jericho]. That was followed by Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin's visit to the occupied territories. That was the 
first time a Turkish foreign minister had visited the occupied 
territories for 45 years. 
  Several political experts believe that the improvement of 
relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv should be assessed within 
the framework of the U.S. plan for a new order in the Middle 
East. The experts are convinced that Washington is directing 
pressure on the Arab countries in the Middle East to force them 
to coexist in peace with the Zionist regime. As far as 
Washington is concerned, that will establish a kind of peace 
that will safeguard U.S. interests in the region. Considering 
that, the political experts in Washington are trying to draw up 
plans for a rapprochement among the countries of the region, 
using pretexts such as the establishment of the Middle East 
[words indistinct] or the establishment of a common market in 
the region. 
  However, several political experts are convinced that the 
aim 
of establishing such organizations is to obstruct the 
strengthening of the activities of Islamic movements, such as 
the Hizbullah, which pose a threat to the interests of Western 
countries and reactionary forces in the region. The political 
experts are also convinced that, in addition to their struggle 
against the Islamic movements, the organizations will try to 
resolve the problems that threaten tranquillity in the region, 
problems that concern security, the water supply, and economic 
development. These organizations will be established through 
economic, military, and political cooperation between the 
Zionist regime, Turkey, and Egypt, the strongest allies of the 
Western countries in the region. They will be assigned two 
tasks to fulfill in the political and economic fields. Israel, 
Turkey, and Egypt have been assigned to cooperate to facilitate 
the establishment of a new order in the Middle East, as planned 
by the Western countries. 
  However, the Western countries and their allies have failed 
to realize a fact in the Middle East: the existence of the 
Islamic revolutionary movements, which are strengthening 
regardless of the strong pressure on them. U.S. and Zionist 
designs cannot obstruct those movements, even if certain 
countries in the region cooperate with Washington and the 
Zionist regime.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Improved Relations Between Ankara </F>
and Tel Aviv"] 
  [Text] President Ezer Weizman arrived in Ankara for a 
four-day visit to Turkey on 24 January. Effective security 
measures have been taken to protect him. Weizman was invited by 
President Demirel. His arrival in Ankara is regarded as his 
first visit to a foreign country after he was elected to serve 
as Israel's president. 
  The officials in Ankara and Tel Aviv have described his 
visit 
as vital. Meanwhile, Weizman has said that his first visit to 
Turkey is very important for Israel. 
  It is common knowledge that the relations between Ankara and 
Tel Aviv have improved noticeably in the economic and military 
fields during the past few years. It is also common knowledge 
that the Zionist regime and the Turkish Government have 
maintained high-level relations for a long time. Turkey was the 
first Islamic country to officially recognize Israel on 28 March 
1949. 
  President Demirel has said that the objective behind 
Weizman's visit is the improvement of relations between Ankara 
and Tel Aviv, which have existed since 1948. Several experts 
have linked the improvement of relations between Turkey and 
Israel to their common interests, stressing that the 
geopolitical conditions in the Middle East after the agreement 
the PLO reached with Israel have given momentum to the relations 
between the two countries. 
  Meanwhile, the Zionist officials believe that the 
strengthening of the Islamic movements in the Middle East pose a 
threat to Israel's security. In fact, Prime Minister Rabin has 
recently described the Islamic movements in the region as a 
threat to the Middle East peace process. 
  Tel Aviv is convinced that Turkey plays an important role in 
the region not only because it supports the Zionist regime but 
also because it is an Islamic country governed by a secular 
administration and has significant water resources and advanced 
technology, which enables it to manufacture F-16 aircraft. As 
such, Turkey can meet Israel's vital needs. For example, it can 
supply water to Israel. 
  It has been reported that Demirel and Weizman have held 
talks 
on the joint use of water resources in the region, developments 
in the Middle East, the agreement between the PLO and Israel, 
and the improvement of bilateral cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  However, considering a possible reaction by Turkey's Islamic 
people, the Turkish officials must try to find a logical 
explanation for the recent improvement of relations between 
Ankara and Tel Aviv.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak and the accompanying delegation returned to Cairo from 
Ankara last night following talks with his Turkish counterpart 
and other officials. [passage omitted] 
  The Egyptian president's lightning visit to Turkey was his 
third since 1985. Yesterday's meeting between Mubarak and his 
Turkish counterpart reveals the nature of relations between 
Cairo and Ankara. The meeting was aimed at expanding the scope 
of political, economic, cultural, and military cooperation 
between the two countries. This cooperation is of special 
importance in light of the two countries' status in the region 
and of their relations with Israel. 
  The Zionist entity's President Ezer Weizman paid an official 
four-day visit to Turkey one week before Mubarak's visit. 
Weizman said that the Middle East's future is dependent on 
cooperation between Israel, Turkey, and Egypt. A number of 
political observers believe that such meetings are a preparatory 
step toward concluding a regional alliance that will give the 
Egyptian, Israeli, and Turkish Governments the right opportunity 
for confronting every possible danger and for implementing their 
own policies. The United States is supporting this step to 
strengthen the ties of tripartite coordination and cooperation. 
The spread of the Islamic trend and the Islamic forces' 
activities topped the items discussed by Turkey, Israel, and 
Egypt. 
  On the other hand, it can be said that strengthening Turkish 
and Egyptian relations with the Zionist entity prepares the 
proper ground for the normalization of relations between the 
other Arab countries and the usurper entity. It also prepares 
the ground for lifting the Arab economic boycott of this entity. 
This is quite evident to anyone who analyzes the political 
trend. 
  The Islamic trend in the region is the primary target of the 
policy of developing relations between Egypt, Israel, and 
Turkey. This policy aims to tighten the noose around the 
countries that exercise independent policies that are not linked 
to the imperialist forces.

  [Excerpts] Egyptian President Husni Mubarak last night 
returned to Cairo after paying a one-day visit to Ankara. 
  Leading a high-ranking political and economic delegation, he 
met and conferred with his Turkish counterpart and also other 
officials of that country. [passage omitted] 
  Since 1985 this was the third visit of the Egyptian 
president 
to Turkey. The Tuesday visit of the head of the Egyptian regime 
to Ankara, besides confirming contacts and ties between Cairo 
and Ankara, was aimed at further expanding political, economic, 
cultural, and military cooperation and also at boosting ties. 
  This cooperation can assume special significance in view of 
the position of Turkey and Egypt in the region on the top of 
their ties with Israel. 
  Last week, Ezer Weizman, head of the Zionist regime, had 
paid 
a four-day visit to Turkey. Weizman, in connection with his 
Ankara visit, had commented that the destiny of the Middle East 
would be framed with the collaboration of Israel, Turkey, and 
Egypt. 
  Some political experts assess these contacts in line with 
the 
efforts to conclude a regional treaty through which the leaders 
of Egypt, Turkey, and the Zionist regime could counter the 
threats posed to them by uniting and also forging necessary 
coordination. Thus, they can execute their desired policy, which 
undoubtedly enjoyed the U.S. backing. 
  In this connection, Islamism and escalation of Islamic 
groups' operations are among the most important problems which 
are faced by Turkey, Israel, and Egypt. Also the ties of Turkey 
and Egypt with the Zionist regime can be examined from the angle 
that they can pave the way for normalization of Tel Aviv's 
relations with Arab states and also lead to the lifting of 
economic sanctions against Israel. 
  Hence, political experts analyze the strengthening of ties 
among Egypt, Turkey, and Israel within the framework of 
restricting independent and non-aligned policy and also 
jeopardizing the Islamic tendency in the region.

To Issue Amnesty for Thousands of Iranian Prisoners"] 
  [Excerpt] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iranian 
"Supreme Guide" 'Ali Khamene'i has rejected a request submitted 
by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to issue a general amnesty for 
thousands of prisoners in Iran. 
  Sources close to the Rafsanjani wing have said that the 
Iranian president was hoping that the amnesty -- coupled with 
new measures to ease the restrictions imposed on cultural 
activities -- would help Iran to improve its image with regard 
to its human right records. But its seems that Khamene'i took 
the advice of hard-line factions opposed to any "sign of 
weakness." 
  Rafsanjani suffered another setback yesterday when the 
Majles 
Financial Committee announced its disapproval of the 
government's proposal to increase petrol prices from 250 riyals 
to 600 riyals -- an increase of 22 cents. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 31, IRNA -- Head of Azeri Parliamentary 
Delegation, Sultan Mohammadov said today that Western meddlings 
and Russian support for the current "unpleasant" situation in 
Azerbaijan are two threatening factors for the republic's 
independence. 
  In a meeting with Deputy Majlis Speaker, Hojjat ol-Eslam Dr. 
Hasan Rowhani, he criticized international forums for keeping 
silent towards the five year-old Armenian aggression against the 
republic and accused them of adopting impractical measures. 
  He described Iran's Majlis as a "democratic, free and 
independent parliament" and said Azerbaijan could well benefit 
from Iran's experiences in the legislative field. 
  He appreciated Iran's assistance to the peoples of 
Azerbaijan 
and Nakhichevan and hoped for expansion of mutual relations in 
all areas. 
  Rowhani said that Iran condemns any aggression against the 
Azerbaijan Republic and believes that any change of borders will 
put regional security and stability in jeopardy. 
  Iran believes that military confrontations cannot bring any 
permanent settlement to the Karabakh conflict and that the 
dispute should be resolved through political and peaceful means, 
he added. 
  Rowhani stressed that Iran and Azerbaijan should promote 
bilateral cooperation especially in the economic, parliamentary, 
scientific and cultural fields. 
  He also expressed Iran's readiness to participate in 
economic 
projects in Azerbaijan especially in agriculture, industry, oil 
and joint operation in the Caspian Sea.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 1, IRNA -- The Azeri head of 
Azerbaijan-Iran Parliamentary Friendship Group Sultan Mohammadov 
and Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American Affairs Mahmoud 
Va'ezi here today discussed role the two countries' parliaments 
in expanding bilateral relations. 
  Va'ezi said that formation of parliamentary friendship group 
has had a positive impact on bilateral relations. He also 
referred to mistakes made by the previous leadership of 
Azerbaijan. He added that certain elements who do not favour 
expansion of bilateral relations are spreading rumours. 
  Mohammadov said that Abulfaz Elchibey had uttered statements 
against Iran to please the U.S. "The Baku government has been 
working to improve bilateral ties ever since Gaydar Aliyev 
assumed power," the Azeri official said. He added that the 
Azeris have regained their identity and religious activities 
have increased remarkably. 
  On Karabakh dispute, Mohammadov criticized policy of certain 
countries towards the conflict and said they were trying to 
achieve their objectives by keeping Azerbaijan preoccupied. 
However, he added, Baku's recent victories have forced certain 
countries and international forums to take actions in order to 
end the clashes. Mohammadov thanked Iran for its political 
support for his country at the international forums and the 
assisting Azeri and Nakhichevani refugees.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 2, IRNA -- The Islamic Propagation

pressures on oppressed Muslim nations, Bosnians in particular. 
  The statement, issued Tuesday on the first day of the 
Ten-Day 
Dawn ceremonies marking the 15th anniversary of the victory of 
the Islamic revolution, said the world arrogance had not spared 
any attempt to trample upon the rights of the oppressed nations 
of the world. It further added that the anniversary was being 
celebrated at a time when enemies were hatching plots against it. 
  The organization underlined its respect for all 
materialistic 
and spiritual achievements of the Islamic revolution and for all 
who served the causes of the Islamic Republic. It called on the 
nation to actively take part in the ceremonies and, under the 
wise leadership of the revolution leader Ayatollah 'Ali 
Khamene'i, continue their struggle against cultural assault by 
the world arrogance.

  [Text] The Pakistani newspaper THE MUSLIM has referred to 
the request made by the United States that various countries 
refrain from defense cooperation with the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and said: The Clinton administration is preventing the 
rebuilding of the Iranian army. 
  The paper notes the hollow claim made by the United States 
that Iran supports terrorism, adding: The United States forced 
Iraq to fight against Iran for eight years. Was this not an act 
of terrorism? Was this act not motivated by the wish to alter 
the balance of forces to the advantage of the regime occupying 
Jerusalem? However, now, when Iran is trying to rebuild its 
army after eight years of war, the United States has asked 
various countries to refrain from defense cooperation with Iran. 
  THE MUSLIM concludes by saying: The United States' 
confrontation with Iran is continuing and this has, in fact, 
resulted in Iran being strengthened.

  [Text] Semnan, Feb. 1, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Hassan Rowhani said here Tuesday that due to fall of 
oil prices Iran lost dlrs. [dollars] four billion in its 
revenues in the current Iranian calendar year, 1372 (March 
1993-94). 
  He added that in the current year's budget price of oil was 
set at dlrs. 17 per barrel, but the average price of each barrel 
of Iranian oil was dlrs. 14. Presently each barrel of oil is 
sold for dlrs. 11, he said. 
  Rowhani said that Iran lost dlrs. 6.4 billion in the course 
of the first five-year development plan due to fluctuation of 
dollar against other hard currencies. 
  On Iran's foreign debts, he said that the country has 
managed 
to solve the problem despite the problems created by the U.S. 
  Referring to the debate in Majles on the next year's budget 
bill, he said that in the course of the debates the deputies 
decided to set the government revenues at rls. [rials] 70,000 
billion instead of the proposed rls. 80,000 billion. 
  He said encouraging export of non-oil commodities will do 
the 
country good and it is a national and Islamic duty. 
  He added that the non-oil exports this year amounted to 
dlrs. 
5,000 million and proposed easing the present restrictions in 
this respect.

  [Text] The 12th round of peace talks between Israel and 
Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians will end in 
Washington this afternoon. Our correspondent in Washington Arye 
Golan reports that, in all, eight meetings attended by only few 
officials were held far from the media. Despite this format, no 
substantial progress is reported on any of the tracks. The 
talks will resume in Washington in about two weeks. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres hopes it will be possible to 
finalize two or three clauses with Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo next 
week in order to pave the road for implementing the autonomy 
agreement in the territories. Minister Peres spoke with 
correspondents in the White House before meeting U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore. He emphasized that the two sides are trying 
to adhere to the timetable, but it will not adversely affect the 
negotiations if they continue another week or another month. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has rejected a proposal to send 
Yo'el Singer, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, to talks 
with the PLO representatives in Cairo this week. Mr. Rabin 
decided that the talks will not be resumed before Foreign 
Minister Peres returns from the United States. This is reported 
by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz. 
  In the Davos talks it has transpired that the Palestinians 
want to establish outposts manned by Palestinian policemen along 
the traffic axes in the Gaza Strip. Israel is opposed to this. 
Prime Minister Rabin is also opposed to the deployment of 
Palestinian customs inspectors at the crossing points.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the PLO </F>
Executive Committee, at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva on 
1 February -- read by announcer] 
  [Excerpts] Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ibrahima Fall, assistant 
general secretary for human rights, Mr. Petrovskiy, heads and 
members of delegations, ladies and gentlemen. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Chairman, your committee's session is being held at a 
very important and critical period in view of the international 
changes and their impact on human rights in various parts of the 
world. 
  The international changes which put an end to the Cold War 
period were accompanied by many regional and internal wars in 
Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. As regards the Middle 
East, the situation is still the same and the volcano of its 
wars has not settled yet. You know, ladies and gentlemen, the 
numerous human rights violations generated by these wars. Human 
rights violations perpetrated during wars or foreign occupation 
resulting from war may be the worst and the most serious ones, 
and in any case of war, people are the victims, be this war real 
or cold, international or regional or internal. 
  The result is always victims among people. No one can 
predict putting an end to one kind of war and ignore other kinds 
of wars which are themselves resulting from other wars. The 
Cold War has come to an end but other wars have been ignited and 
they are ceaselessly threatening to expand. 
  Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to inform you from this 
solemn rostrum that out of our commitment to human rights, 
democratic freedoms, international laws, and the UN Charter, and 
out of our concern for building a healthy, dynamic, open, and 
active society, our first decision dated 30 September 1993 
following the decision to establish a Palestinian National 
Authority, was to approve the creation of the higher Palestinian 
national human rights commission as an independent body. 
  The decision stipulates that the task of this commission is 
to follow up and secure the provision of the requirements for 
the protection of human rights in all Palestinian laws, 
legislation, and systems, as well as in the work of the various 
services, bodies, and institutions belonging to the Palestinian 
national authority. 
  We confirmed a few weeks ago the official recognition of 
this 
body which will include a number of moral and legal 
personalities and it will be chaired by sister Dr. Hanan 
'Ashrawi. 
  Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the 
world's 
geopolitical map from the perspective of the principles of human 
rights and international humanitarian law, we would not be able 
to move from one place to another without putting our fingers on 
grave and systematic violations of human rights, whether by 
torture or other forms of inhumane treatment, premeditated 
killing, arbitrary execution, detention and arrest without 
trial, racism, racial discrimination and segregation, foreign 
occupation and domination, hatred of immigrants and the 
emergence of neo Nazism, poverty and deliberate impoverishment, 
all forms of denial of national, economic, social and cultural 
rights, right of self-determination of peoples under foreign 
occupation and domination, religious extremism, terrorism, state 
terrorism, discrimination against women, and the absence of the 
sovereignty of law. This is why I have the pleasure of praising 
the Vienna Human Rights Declaration which emanated from the 
international conference on human rights held in Vienna in the 
middle of last year. I would also like to praise the United 
Nations General Assembly's decision to adopt this important 
declaration. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, at two previous sessions I addressed 
you on the state of human rights everywhere in the world and, 
specifically, in Palestine. I addressed you on human rights and 
the occasional [ahyanan] violations, exploitation, and 
mistreatment to which these rights are exposed. [passage 
omitted] 
  I have also spoken to you about the extent of the suffering 
of our Palestinian people under Israeli occupation as a result 
of violations of human rights and basic liberties, which the 
violations have extended to include all rights without 
exception, starting with violation of the right to live and 
ending with violation of the right of expression. This was 
achieved by subjecting our people to deliberate killing, 
torture, arbitrary arrest, deportation, seizure of land and 
building settlements on them, collective punishment, disruption 
of educational programs, closure of schools and universities, 
attacks on places of worship and holy places, closure of trade 
unions, destruction of the Palestinian national economy and our 
people's right to exercise self-determination in their 
territory. Furthermore, the occupation in itself constitutes a 
grave violation of our people's human rights in our occupied 
land. 
  Your respected committee has dealt with this painful reality 
for more than 26 years, and has rejected and condemed it, and 
called for its end. It has also called for Israel's withdrawal 
from the Palestinian territories, including Holy Jerusalem and 
the other Arab territories it occupied by force in 1967, as a 
radical solution for the deterioration of human rights and the 
return of the Palestinian people's right to their homeland and 
self-determination without external interference. This action 
has been taken through its numerous resolutions which have 
continued with its latest, 49th, session in which it appointed 
Mr. Rene Felber as special envoy for investigation into Israel's 
violations of the principles of international law, international 
human law, and the provisions of the fourth Geneva agreement in 
our occupied land. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, our Palestinian people, 
who have made huge sacrifices for decades in order to recover 
their homeland and rights, are the people most in need of a just 
and comprehensive peace because of foreign occupation and the 
injustice and tragedies of expulsion as a result of that, as 
well as denial of their national rights. These rights were 
affirmed by your respected commission, the UN General Assembly, 
the UN Security Council, and the other international meetings 
and were strengthened by the principles of international 
legality and international law. 
  Our people's struggle for peace has become linked to our 
deep 
conviction in peace based on justice, and there is no peace with 
occupation or aggression and denial of rights. On this basis, 
we have continuously responded to all the international peace 
initiatives which led in the end to the Madrid Conference and 
the resulting negotiations in Washington and Oslo, which also 
produced the agreement on the Declaration of Principles which 
was signed in Washington on 13 September last between the PLO 
and Israel's Government, as well as the declaration of mutual 
recognition between the PLO and Israel. 
  The signing of the above mentioned agreement came as a first 
step expressing good intentions and goodwill to achieve the 
peace of the brave, which is based on justice and respect for 
human rights, a peace which turns the page of history containing 
the occupation, tragedies, wars, and hostilities. It is also a 
peace which opens wide prospects before a new stage of 
relations, of fruitful cooperation between the Palestinian and 
the Israeli peoples which will be based on good neighborliness, 
mutual respect, and solving conflicts with peaceful means, 
dialogue, and arbitration. 
  The signing of this agreement under the auspices of 
President 
Clinton, the evidence of the U.S. and Russian co-sponsors of the 
conference, and the blessing of the whole world formed the first 
necessary step to move forward on the road of finding a 
comprehensive and just settlement to the conflict in the Middle 
East on the basis of implementing Security Council's resolutions 
242 and 338. [passage omitted] 
  We entered these talks with good intentions to achieve a 
comprehensive and just peace, and we are still pursuing them 
with good intention. We hope that the Israeli Government has 
the same good intention and gives it a concrete form toward the 
agreement by adhering completely to it in letter and and in 
spirit. [passage omitted] 
  All this took place after the signing of the agreement in 
Washington. It stirred up negative reactions among our 
Palestinian people, the Arab masses, and the peoples of the 
region and generated convictions that the Israeli Government is 
not serious in implementing this agreement. The seriousness of 
this is doubled by Israel which places obstacles to the 
implementation of the agreement and attempts to change its aims 
according to its whims, for example, the redeployment of Israeli 
forces in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region instead of 
withdrawing from them in accordance with the Declaration of 
Principles, in addition to other problems. These attempts still 
form the major characteristic of the Israeli negotiators, and 
this motivated us to look for the good intentions and the 
measures to make the required confidence available in order to 
move forward toward the hoped for goals in a comprehensive and 
just peace, which we have not managed to feel so far. 
  Mr. Chairman, we would like to affirm to you our unyielding 
faith in the peace process, and on the basis of that we will 
continue to give impetus to the whole of the peace process, 
including negotiations. We will not be swayed by any maneuvers, 
retractions, or frustrations. We hope that the Israeli side 
will understand that this agreement has a clear perspective in 
so far as it concerns Palestinian human rights. We interpret 
past violations as a result of the occupation. We have to 
equate them now with a new action created by the spirit and 
prospect of peace. Therefore, we hope, and undoubtedly you 
share our hope, that we will see Israel setting out to implement 
the rules of the fourth Geneva Accord and the principles of 
international law, and abandon their old methods, fanaticism, 
and prevarication so that we will be able to work together in 
order to reach the peace and security which we all aspire to. 
  In light of these developments, the need for the 
international community to persistently bear its 
responsibilities regarding the issue of Palestine is firmly 
established. Any attempt to marginalize the role of the 
international community, represented in the United Nations, in 
this issue is an attempt to vilify international legitimacy and 
to undermine its principles on the basis of which the peace 
process was built, starting with drawing on the UN Charter and 
the UN Security Council resolutions and ending with guaranteeing 
the Palestinian people's right to exercise their national rights 
as a basis for reaching a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace 
in the Middle East region. 
  We would like to stress that the results of the peace 
process and the ongoing negotiations must be based on the 
rulings of international legitimacy and the principles of 
international law as a means of safeguarding the noble 
principles of the international community which the world has 
accepted as an instrument to establish the bases of justice, 
friendship, and the resolution of disputes among states by 
peaceful means. For our part, we will push with all our 
strength to ensure the success of the peace process so that our 
future generations and our children and their children will be 
able to live in peace, security, stability, harmony, and freedom 
far away from threats, repression, violence, and wars. To that 
end, I turn to you, for your honorable commission to continue 
its mission of defending our people and their right to their 
homeland, and putting an end to human rights violations and 
protecting human rights in our occupied land for as long as the 
occupation continues, particularly in the transitional phase 
during which the occupation forces will remain in parts of our 
land. [passage omitted]

  [Text] These Algerian-IMF talks have entered a decisive 
phase, which is aimed at signing an agreement on a three-year 
stable economic program. Our colleague Rabah Hallis wrote an 
analytical paper on the issue, which will be read by Mokhtar 
Maher: 
  Mr. Mourad Benachenhou, the economy minister, affirmed that 
Algeria's present problems center around continued inflation 
pressures and the increase in the unemployment level, especially 
among the youth, on the other. 
  Prevailing over these problems call for an agreement with 
the 
IMF, because the continuation of the situation as it is would 
lead to the collapse of the whole of the production apparatus 
and the dismemberment of the social body. 
  But the agreement with the IMF on a stable economic program 
does not mean that all the problems would be solved in a 
comprehensive manner, because the economic and social situation 
in Algeria is very complicated. Any violation of either of the 
social or economic balances could result in social and political 
dangers. 
  The statements of the different officials confirm that 
Algeria is attempting to sign a politically and socially 
acceptable agreement. The main problem lies here. How could a 
compromise solution, between Algeria's demands of a politically 
and socially acceptable agreement, on the one hand, and the 
contents of the programs proposed by the IMF, on the other, be 
reached ? 
  The contents of the programs that the IMF is calling for 
have 
a very high social cost, because in essence they restrain social 
demand and attempt to absorb the surplus, while Algeria knows a 
big increase in demand that is not matched by a supply which 
suffers from weaknesses in its structure. This means that the 
real average of income will noticeably fall. Would it therefore 
be possible to make this fall acceptable socially? 
  Mr. Benhamouda's recent statements reveal that the General 
Union of Algerian Workers [UGTA] does not any more object to the 
idea of devaluing the dinar if the aim was to control inflation. 
This stance is considered new in the UGTA's thinking. Has 
Benhamouda been finally convinced that the continuation of the 
existing situation is more dangerous to the workers than signing 
a stable economic agreement with the IMF the main aim of which 
is to control the levels of unemployment and inflation?

  [Text] Muscat, Feb. 2, IRNA -- Ranking Omani officials 
Tuesday [1 February] called for promotion of bilateral economic 
and commercial ties with Iran and stressed that Muscat attached 
great importance to its ties with Iran. 
  Governor general of Fars Province, in south of Iran, 
Mohammad 
'Ali Naqi Jahromi who is currently here to open the first 
exhibition of products of the province, yesterday met and 
conferred with two Omani ministers. 
  Underlining the need for further expansion of mutual ties, 
the Omani national heritage and culture minister, Faysal 
Bin-'Ali Al Sa'id, described Iran as a great Islamic country. 
  Speaking to IRNA, he voiced his country's readiness to 
remove 
any obstacle on the way of bilateral economic and commercial 
ties. 
  Another Omani official, Commerce and Industry Minister 
Makbul 
Bin-'Ali Bin-Sultan [name and title as received] also called for 
joint venture and exchange of political and economic delegations 
between the two countries. 
  Bin-Sultan who is also head of Iran-Oman joint economic and 
commercial commission, termed as good diplomatic relations 
between Tehran and Oman. 
  Jahromi stressed that foreign countries and enemies of Islam 
were attempting to sow discord among Islamic countries in order 
to seize the markets in those countries with their own products. 
  The first exhibition of Fars Province opened here Wednesday 
with the participation of over 80 provincial industrial and 
producing companies in a 4,000 square meter roofed area.

  [Text] Amman, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Jordan has ordered 21 of the 
26 Iranian diplomats based here to leave by the end of the 
month, the foreign ministry said Thursday [3 February]. 
  Jordanian political sources said the government ordered out 
the Iranians because of their contacts with Islamic 
fundamentalists. 
  The ministry informed the Iranian authorities about the move 
at the beginning of January, giving the diplomats two months to 
leave. 
  The official reason was that Jordan wanted to reach a 
balance 
between the number of diplomats in each country, as Jordan had 
only two in Tehran. 
  Jordan and Iran resumed diplomatic relations in January 1991 
after a 10-year break. 
  Tehran severed relations with Amman because of its support 
for Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988. 
  The Iranian embassy in Amman reopened in March 1991 and 
Jordan's embassy in Tehran soon after.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: In Washington, peace talks at the level 
of delegation heads continue amid repeated U.S. statements that 
this time the talks should produce positive results and concrete 
progress. Reports also say the U.S. secretary of state is 
planning to visit the region next month in a fresh bid to 
advance the peace process, especially on the Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks. 
  The United States apparently attaches great importance to 
the 
current Washington talks, due to its firm conviction that peace 
in the Middle East is impossible without Syria and that reaching 
a Syrian-Israeli agreement will open all the doors of the region 
to a just, comprehensive, and durable peace. 
  The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill 
Clinton centered on the essence of Middle East peace. It 
concluded that there is a need to establish a real and firm 
peace accepted by the peoples of the region -- a peace that 
reflects positively on their countries and that can withstand 
successive developments. President al-Asad called such a peace 
the peace of the brave, in accordance with which occupation will 
end and Arab rights will be restored. 
  For its part, Syria has announced it will continue to seek a 
just and comprehensive peace. Perhaps the best evidence of its 
belief in peace, and in efforts to achieve it, is the talks it 
is holding in Washington, despite public Israeli pronouncements 
that reflect no change in the Israeli position, even after the 
Geneva summit. The summit tossed the ball into the Israeli 
court. It proved Syria really believes in peace and is 
struggling to achieve a just, honorable solution accepted by 
current generations and safeguarded by future generations -- 
peace that enables them to devote their resources to development 
and progress. 
  We say this because Israeli officials, especially the head 
of 
the Israeli government, have recently cast doubt on Syria's 
intentions and sought to undermine its role and status in the 
region. They did not conceal their concern about the U.S. 
shifting toward Syria because it is the key to peace in the 
region. President Clinton and the U.S. secretary of state said 
Syria is an extremely important country that has a pivotal role 
to play in the peace process. 
  By casting such doubts, the Israelis seek to circumvent the 
objective of a just and comprehensive peace in the region. Such 
peace requires full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, southern 
Lebanon, and all occupied Arab territories, and the 
implementation of Security Council resolutions to the letter. 
  It is no coincidence that the head of the Israeli government 
has raised the idea of a referendum on the Golan, contrary to 
all international resolutions, charters, and principles. The 
Golan has been Syrian territory since time immemorial. There 
can be no peace without its full return to the mother homeland. 
  Threatening to conduct a referendum is only a maneuver to 
circumvent the objective of a just and comprehensive peace. It 
is also an attempt to contain the U.S. position and conviction 
that Syria is the key to the Middle East peace process. 
  The current Washington talks will be a decisive test to 
Israel. The whole world expects a decisive shift by the Israeli 
rulers toward peace and an end to the policy of maneuver and 
procrastination that has so far prevented substantive progress 
leading to genuine, comprehensive peace in the Middle East.

  [Text] In a news conference on arrival at his place of 
residence at the al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad, Rolf Ekeus voiced 
optimism about arriving at a situation which would enable the 
committee to submit its report to the UN Security Council for 
consideration of the oil embargo against Iraq. 
  He said that his optimism is based on the developments that 
took place between the two sides in November 1993 when Iraq 
approved Resolution 715. 
  He said: My feeling is that we have started well and that 
progress has been made. He said that his talks with Iraqi 
officials will deal with political and technical issues, 
including the application of long-term monitoring, which is 
related to Resolution 715. 
  He said: For our part, we will explain the situation at the 
UN Security Council as well as the prospects for development and 
progress. Our hope is to make progress as soon as possible so 
that the committee would be able to submit its report to the UN 
Security Council and so that it would be able to affirm that 
Iraq has honored its obligations. Thus, we can do something to 
pressure the UN Security Council to take the necessary measures 
to lift the oil embargo against Iraq. 
  He explained that his visit to Iraq is part of the dialogue 
that started in July 1993 and to maintain the momentum of the 
positive developments that have been realized. 
  In response to a question on the duration of his visit to 
Baghdad, Ekeus said: This depends on the talks that we will 
hold with the Iraqi side. 
  He said: The talks will certainly cover the issue of lifting 
the embargo against Iraq, but I cannot make any comments because 
the process is continuing and we hope that it will become more 
extensive. 
  The delegation includes John Scott, the committee's legal 
adviser; Tim Terevan [name as received], the committee 
spokesman; and Maurizio Zifferero, deputy chairman of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  The first session of talks will begin at the Foreign 
Ministry 
at 2000 today.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that 
Israel will not start implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
before a written, mutually-acceptable, and detailed agreement 
has been attained. The prime minister added that only a miracle 
will enable the completion of the negotiations next week, and 
that some of the issues discussed in Davos remain open. The 
Palestinians have not reported to the economic talks in Paris 
for two weeks, Rabin stated, and the negotiations on the 
transfer of civil powers are stuck. Our political correspondent 
Shlomo Raz points out that the prime minister made these remarks 
after the signing ceremony of scientific agreements with Austria. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 2 February 
adds: 
"Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated today that PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat's goal is to establish a Palestinian state in the first 
stage, and a confederation with Jordan at a later stage." In a 
recorded passage in English, Rabin says: "To the best of my 
knowledge, the goal is a Palestinian state; perhaps after that a 
confederation. But, this is not my problem."] 
  [Referring to the reported criticism of security officials 
at 
the understandings reached in Davos by Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres and 'Arafat, Rabin said "he did not want to get into 
abstract and fabricated arguments."]

  [Mirhij] We will not jump to conclusions before the 
investigation is complete. [end recording]

  [Text] Dhaka, Feb 1 (AFP) -- At least 15,000 residents of 
the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka Tuesday joined a mourning march 
and mass prayers for the six opposition supporters gunned down 
by rivals in post-election violence, witnesses said. 
  The marchers, including leaders from Shayk Hasina Wajed's 
main-opposition Awami League (AL) and the left-wing Workers 
Party, carried coffins of the dead to the downtown Baitul 
Mukarram national mosque. 
  They silently carried black flags and a banner demanding the 
punishment of the killers, and prayed for the dead. 
  The marchers were mostly from the Lalbagh area, in the old 
parts of Dhaka, where six people were killed and more than 30 
injured Monday when AL's victory procession was fired on by 
unidentified gunmen, a day after the country's first mayoral 
city elections, police and witnesses said. 
  A policeman on duty said the number of mourners could be as 
high as 30,000. 
  The mourners later buried the dead without incident in a 
nearby graveyard, but under heavy security, witnesses said. 
  Security was intensified Tuesday as the residents staged a 
half-day protest strike, and the atmosphere was tense, with 
shops, schools and businesses remaining closed. 
  "We have strong police and BDR (para-military Bangladesh 
Rifles) forces deployed in the area," one police officer at the 
Lalbagh police station said. 
  No violence was reported during the stoppage. 
  Witnesses and police had said earlier that unidentified 
gunmen opened fire on supporters of AL mayoral candidate 
Mohammad Hanif, who took a commanding lead in weekend polls, 
killing six. Eighteen supporters were reported to be in stable 
condition Tuesday. 
  But Dhaka newspapers reported Tuesday that the attack was 
carried out by Abdul Aziz, a member of the ruling Bangladesh 
Nationalist Party and a losing candidate for city commissioner, 
and his supporters. 
  The mass circulation Daily ITTEFAQ newspaper said Abdul Aziz 
had gone into hiding, and one resident said unidentified people 
ransacked and looted his home late Monday. 
  The government, in a press note late Monday said six 
suspects 
from two rival groups have been arrested in connection with the 
"unfortunate incident." 
  Angry mourners Monday also had attacked three government 
ministers when they went to the hospital to pay homage to the 
dead, but police rescued them unscathed by throwing tear gas and 
using batons. 
  During Sunday's first ever mayoral and city commissioner 
elections, one school boy was killed and more than 200 were 
injured in sporadic clashes between rival groups. 
  Hanif is leading Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's BNP nominee 
ex- 
mayor Mirza Abbas, by 75,200 votes, in 704 out of 737 districts 
in Dhaka. 
  In the port city of Chittagong, AL candidate Mohiuddin 
Chowdhury was unofficially declared mayor, based on preliminary 
election results. 
  While BNP clinched victory in the cities of Khulna and 
Rajshahi. 
  Because of the violence, the election commission cancelled 
voting in 26 centres and withheld results in three others. 
  The official BANGLADESH SANGBAD SANGSTHA News Agency said 
the 
results in four districts "could not be traced," but the total 
number of votes cast there was 72,080. BSS did not elaborate, 
but there was a report that a recount would be held. 
  The elections were crucial, as it was considered the first 
popularity test of the two main political groups since the 1991 
parliamentary elections under a caretaker government.

  [Text] The vigilance of the Muslim revolutionary people of 
Zahedan neutralized a plot by a few counter-revolutionaries who 
sought to overshadow the people's fervor and enthusiasm on the 
eve of the 16th [as heard] anniversary of the Islamic revolution. 
  These people congregated on Khayyam Avenue in Zahedan to 
agitate and disrupt things when the avenue's vendors and 
residents tackled them violently. 
  The agitators got into a brawl with the people but were 
overpowered by the Law Enforcement forces and dispersed. Pir 
Mohammad Abubakr, who threw stones at the disruptive elements, 
told an IRNA correspondent: The elements affiliated with 
foreigners are seeking to instigate differences to detract from 
the people's dazzling presence on the revolution scene and to 
project the Ten Days of Dawn celebrations as lackluster. He 
said: Whatever the plot the powers of world arrogance hatch 
against the Islamic revolution, the people of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran become more determined to safeguard the 
revolution's values. 
  Amanollah Ama'i, 42, said that the tearing up of flags, 
breaking of colored lights, and attacks on stores were only a 
sign of the arsonists' inauspicious intentions to disrupt the 
grand celebrations of the Ten Days of Dawn. 
  He said: We ask the Law Enforcement officials to combat such 
insurgents with force. 
  Despite the rioters' efforts to disrupt the Day of God 
[Yawm-Allah] celebrations on 1 February, the people continued to 
participate in the ceremonies at the 17 Shahrivar Stadium in 
Zahedan after the agitators were dealt with and the fracas ended.

<F P=106> [Amir Tahiri report: "Ukraine Offers To Sell Its Share of </F>
Soviet Navy to Gulf States"] 
  [Text] London -- Boats, frigates, and submarines 
constitute part of the modern and advanced weapons which have 
recently been introduced to the Gulf region and its neighborhood 
in preparation for the next century. 
  While Iran a few days ago concluded the largest naval-air 
maneuvers of their kind in the Strait of Hormuz, it was 
announced yesterday that Pakistan is in the process of 
purchasing a very modern assaultsubmarine from Sweden costing 
$700 million. 
  Kuwait too has announced that it is currently engaged in 
negotiations to purchase three frigates from France. Even Iraq, 
which has almost nothing, has announced the formation of a 
high-level committee to redirect its strategy toward "the Gulf 
and beyond." 
  Sources in Washington say that Ukraine has contacted a 
number 
of states in the region, offering to sell them a substantial 
part of its share of the former Soviet Navy, especially assault 
ships [sufun hujumiyah], destroyers, speed boats, and minelayers. 
  Ukraine is also said to have contacted Iran and offered to 
sell it one Kilo submarine instead of the third submarine Iran 
was supposed to purchase from Moscow before the latter changed 
its position. 
  Until the end of the sixties most states in the region had 
focused on developing their ground forces, basing their 
strategies on huge tank battles along the lines of the World War 
II model. But after that all of them turned to the acquisition 
of modern aircraft, especially after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. 
  The new focus on the naval force is linked to the growing 
capability to launch missiles from ships against targets deep in 
others' territory. Western experts have accused Pakistan, Iran, 
and Iraq of trying to develop chemical and nuclear weapons that 
can be carried as warheads on medium- and long-range missiles. 
  A team of U.S. experts which will visit Islamabad soon is 
expected to raise this issue with the Pakistani Government. The 
United States wants Pakistan to cancel the deal concerning the 
development of missiles with China and to also sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. Prime Minister Bhutto has indicated 
that she may agree to that in return for Washington's help to 
build her Navy.

  [Excerpt] Kuwait, 4 Feb -- The State Security Court will 
tomorrow resume hearings in the case of the terrorist network 
which was intending to assassinate former US President George 
Bush during his visit to Kuwait last year. The plot was 
instigated and planned by the Iraqi intelligence services. 
  On 25 December last year, the court postponed issuing 
sentences in this case in which 11 Iraqi and three defendants 
are implicated and decided to listen again to the main witness.

  [Text] Moscow, AL-HAYAH -- The Kuwaiti Embassy in Moscow 
has expressed "regret" at the report carried by the official 
news agency ITAR-TASS claiming that Kuwait had frozen the PLO's 
assets in Kuwait. A statement issued by the embassy said that 
the PLO had transferred tens of millions of dollars since July 
1991 from its accounts in Kuwait to Jordan and Switzerland 
without any Kuwaiti objection. 
  The statement emphasized that "the people and Government of 
the state of Kuwait adopt a principled stance in support of the 
Palestinian people's just cause and legitimate rights."

  [Text] In a sign of complications in Yemen's political 
crisis, the Yemen Socialist Party said it seized antiaircraft 
missiles being moved by its northern rivals toward the south. A 
party spokesman said: An Army vehicle carrying 40 antiaircraft 
missiles from the north and heading south was seized by a 
southern brigade. He did not say when the missiles were seized, 
but said this was a new proof of the escalation of the political 
and the military tension in the country. 
  The announcement came hours after Planning Minister 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani blamed Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid's party for delaying the signing of an accord to end the 
political crisis paralyzing the country. Al-Iryani said: There 
are no arrangements for the signing of the accord neither in 
Amman nor inside Yemen as new conditions have been set by the 
Yemen Socialist Party. He said: The YSP wanted constitutional 
legal and security conditions not included in the accord. He 
did not give details, but political sources said the YSP was 
apparently seeking guarantees for its officials from security 
services run by the president's supporters.

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 4 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni forces are 
massing along the former border between North and South Yemen, 
the northern-based General People's Congress (GPC) of President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih charged Thursday [3 February]. 
  "Dozens of tanks, troop transporters and missiles are 
concentrated in the Shabwah region," a congress spokesman told 
the press here. 
  Military units based in the north have not moved any of 
their 
missiles, he insisted, despite allegations to the contrary from 
the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), which operates in the south 
and whose leader, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, is in 
conflict with Salih. 
  The YSP said that southern-based units along the former 
border had seized a shipment of 40 anti-aircraft missiles from 
the north. 
  But the GPC spokesman charged that such reports were 
designed 
"to camouflage troop movements (from the south), deceive public 
opinion and divert attention away from the refusal of the YSP to 
sign (an) agreement in Amman this Sunday." 
  The draft agreement was aimed at ending a dispute over the 
administration of the country that has plagued Yemen since last 
August. 
  Despite the political unification of the north and the south 
in May 1990, the armies from the two regions have never merged. 
  The GPC spokesman accused the YSP of "setting new 
conditions, 
revealing its intention of going back" on the accord, which was 
reached January 18. 
  Salih and al-Bid were due to sign the agreement in Amman on 
Sunday, Arab diplomats in the Jordanian capital said Wednesday, 
but Yemeni officials warned it was unlikely the two sides would 
be ready by then. 
  A member of a mediation committee, 'Abdallah al-Jifri, 
predicted that the accord would probably be signed "just before 
Ramadan," the Moslem month of dawn-to-dusk fasting expected to 
start around February 12.

  [Text] Sanaa, Amman, (News Agencies) -- A responsible 
Jordanian source yesterday said that Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who had 
informed Jordan of their desire to sign their agreement in Amman 
on Sunday [6 February], have said that they now prefer to carry 
out a disengagement of their forces on the ground before signing 
the agreement. 
  The source said that the two Yemeni leaders, in separate 
telephone contacts with Jordanian officials on 2 February, asked 
for Jordan's help in carrying out this disengagement. 
  The source said that His Majesty King Husayn contacted the 
two Yemeni leaders on the phone last Tuesday, at which time they 
agreed to meet in Amman on Sunday to sign the accord on settling 
the crisis. 
  The General People's Congress [GPC], headed by Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has ruled out the possibility of 
an early signing of the national reconciliation agreement to end 
the political crisis, blaming its rival the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] for this delay. 
  On 2 February, President Salih said that the agreement would 
be signed in the Jordanian capital on Saturday, but Planning 
Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, a GPC member, ruled out the 
early signing of the agreement. 
  Al-Iryani told a news conference that no arrangements have 
been made to sign the agreement either in Amman or in Yemen 
since the YSP, under Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has come 
forth with new conditions. 
  Al-Iryani said that the GPC was preparing to go to Amman on 
Saturday but that information became available indicating that 
new conditions have been set and that he could not now say if 
the GPC would go to Amman on Saturday. 
  Al-Iryani added: The new conditions deal with 
constitutional, security, military, and legal affairs that were 
not mentioned in the agreement that the committee comprising 
representatives from all parties, including the GPC and YSP, 
reached in mid-January. The minister said: This is a new 
interpretation and this is strange and surprising. 
  Al-Iryani did not elaborate further, but political sources 
say that it seems that the YSP is asking for guarantees from the 
security bodies that are run by President Salih's supporters 
concerning the safety of its officials, and insists that the 
agreement be implemented before all of its officials return to 
Sanaa. 
  Al-Iryani said: The GPC has no reservations about the 
contents of the agreement. We are ready to sign everything that 
it contains. The GPC is even ready to sign it on board a vessel 
in high seas. He added: The GPC's stand is that the agreement 
should be signed as soon as possible without any obstacles. 
Those who set new conditions should be held responsible. 
  The YSP yesterday said it seized antiaircraft missiles while 
its northern adversaries were moving them toward the south. 
  This announcement highlights the crisis that threatens Yemen 
with fragmentation and takes place at a time when political 
leaders have ruled out the possibility of an early signing of 
the agreement. 
  A YSP spokesman said that a southern brigade seized an army 
vehicle carrying 40 antiaircraft missiles from the north to the 
south.

  [Text] Sanaa, 4 Feb (INA) -- Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih has said he hopes a complete solution to the 
current crisis in Yemen will be achieved after the accord 
document is signed by the Yemeni parties in the Jordanian 
capital soon. 
  In statements published by the Yemeni newspaper 26 
SIBTIMBAR, 
the Yemeni president said the vice president, the prime 
minister, and other ministers from the Yemeni Socialist Party 
should return to Sanaa and resume their duties after signing the 
document. He noted that no party can implement the document 
without the other parties of the government coalition. 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih noted that he will not object 
to Arab and foreign envoys attending the signing ceremony in 
Amman, stressing that the Yemeni parties cannot impose anyone on 
the host country. 
  Regarding the role played by the Kuwaiti regime and the 
Saudi 
authorities in agitating the current Yemeni crisis, the Yemeni 
president accused a Kuwaiti paper of calling for spending the 
last $1 billion in Kuwaiti coffers to partition Yemen. He said 
such an idea provokes all Yemenis. 
  President Salih revealed that the Saudi regime has paid 
large 
amounts of money, estimated at millions of Saudi riyals, to 
agitate the Yemeni crisis. He said: The fact that Saudi 
Arabia has paid such huge amounts of money arouses suspicions 
about the Saudi role in the Yemeni crisis. President Salih said 
this Saudi conduct is considered interference in Yemeni domestic 
affairs, particularly under the current circumstances. 
  He noted that Yemen opposes all forms of terrorism and 
stressed that the recent explosions and assassinations in Yemen 
were carried out by hired elements that oppose Yemeni unity and 
have been opposed to Yemeni unity ever since it was established.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, attended a celebration today on the first 
anniversary of the founding of the 1st Armored Division. 
  The brother president made a speech, in which he expressed 
happiness to share with the brother officers, noncommissioned 
officers, and troops their celebration of the divisions's 
founding anniversary. He praised the role played by the members 
of the 1st Armored Division in defending the revolution since 
the Division was formed as a first battalion in the Armored 
Corps in 1967. The struggler of the Division fought bravely to 
defend the revolution and the Republican regime after pledging 
to God, the homeland, and the revolution to champion the will of 
the people and their aspirations for a better life. They, along 
with their brothers the members of the Armed Forces, were heroes 
in the 70-day epic when they defended Sanaa against the 
conspiracies of the mercenaries and the enemies of the 
Republican regime. 
  The brother chairman said: We are confident that our Armed 
Forces, which defended the Republican regime and made precious 
sacrifices, will offer more sacrifices in the defense of 
national and Yemeni unity and will fight anyone who entertains 
the idea of harming the people's great achievement. The Armed 
Forces will also firmly oppose all elements that try to harm the 
great achievement made on 22 May 1990 -- an irreversible 
achievement for all the Yemeni people that cannot be 
relinquished. 
  Addressing troops, noncommissioned officers, and officers, 
he 
said: You should be armed with national awareness and vigilance 
to perform your national duties in defending the people's gains, 
primarily unity and democracy. Your potent weapon is not 
armored vehicles or equipment or supplies, but your faith in God 
and the homeland, the revolution and unity. 
  We are confident that our Armed Forces in al-Mahrah, Sa'dah, 
Shabwah, Hadramaut, Ta'izz, Ibb, Abyan, Lahd, al-Hudaydah, 
Ma'rib, and any governorate in the republic, will be with the 
homeland and the people and will never be a pliable tool in the 
hands of any element or party that wants to harm the homeland, 
its unity, and democratic approach. Also, they will not allow 
the forces that are hostile to the revolution, unity, and 
democracy to achieve their aims or set the clock back. History 
has a bright record of our Armed Forces and its valiant men. At 
this important juncture in the life of our homeland, history 
will only record a bright chapter about the sacrifices of our 
Armed Forces and their firm support for the people's choices and 
their championing of its causes and constants, foremost of which 
is safeguarding unity and democracy. The annals of history will 
only include the names of sincere people who are faithful to 
their principles and who make sacrifices for these principles. 
History will not include the names of indecisive, weak 
characters who have no principles. 
  The brother chairman added: Unity was achieved by a 
peaceful, democratic means. It made Yemen a giant in front of 
the world. It is unacceptable that whims and personal interests 
should gain the upper hand and harm this achievement. We should 
be more mature in our conduct and thinking in light of this 
great event and the changes yielded by our new situation. I am 
fully confident that all the heroes of our Armed Forces will be 
the shield of unity and will fight relentlessly all those who 
urge division and all forms of regional, parochial, and racial 
affiliations. We are a Yemeni, Arab, and Muslim people whose 
loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--An Arab League official has 
emphasized the importance of achieving Yemeni reconciliation to 
strengthen Arab solidarity and the Arab nation's objectives. 
  The official made this statement while commenting on reports 
that the Yemeni leadership has refused the Arab League's offer 
to sign the document of "the Yemeni accord agreement" at the 
Arab League headquarters in Cairo and prefers to have it signed 
in the Jordanian capital of Amman. 
  The official said: The place where the document will be 
signed is not important. The important thing is to have 
reconciliation between the Yemeni leaders in the interest of 
that country's people. 
  Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid had 
telephoned Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid offering to host the signing of the 
accord agreement between them. The Yemeni leadership declined 
the offer in favor of Amman, as Jordan's King Husayn was the 
mediator in the reconciliation between the Yemeni president and 
his deputy before the offer was made by the Arab League 
secretary general.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Feb (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that 
the meeting between 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres in Cairo on Monday [7 February] will settle numerous 
issues regarding the document formulated in Davos, Switzerland, 
last week. In a statement to MENA today, Sha'th said the Davos 
document is considered to be an integrated deal, stressing that 
the Palestinian party will not commit itself to implementing its 
obligations in the document unless the Israelis implement the 
articles relating to them. 
  Dr. Sha'th pointed out that the Palestinian-Israeli meetings 
were scheduled to continue in Cairo after the 'Arafat-Peres 
meeting in Davos but the Israeli party suspended them until 
after 'Arafat and Peres meet in Cairo. He noted that the 
Palestinian-Israeli committee meetings are expected to resume in 
Cairo directly after the 'Arafat-Peres meeting in Cairo. 
  Dr. Sha'th highlighted that the Palestinian party can 
perform 
its tasks in running the self-rule administration in the Gaza 
Strip and the Jericho area immediately after the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
  MENA has learned that differences occurred between Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
over the Davos document. Palestinian sources told MENA that the 
main dispute within the Israeli leadership focuses mainly on who 
should take the credit for achieving tangible results and 
reaching an agreement with the Palestinian party.

  [Text] The 12th round of peace talks in Washington ended 
today. Our correspondent in Washington Arye Golan reports that 
the delegation heads will meet again in approximately two weeks. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will then leave for a tour 
of the Middle East. 
  In the talks between the Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations, 
it was agreed that the parties would discuss the establishment 
of the Palestinian council, decide on the modalities of the 
elections in the territories, and modify laws in the territories 
prior to the inception of Palestinian self-government. However, 
any practical discussion of these issues would only start after 
an agreement on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First 
proposal has been signed. U.S. sources assessed that due to the 
delay in the negotiations on the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles, the elections for the autonomy 
council would be postponed and would not be held this summer. 
  Some progress on environmental issues was reported in the 
talks between the Jordanian and Israeli delegations.

  [Excerpt] Although generally vague, the picture in 
Washington clearly shows that the suspension of the peace talks 
at the level of delegation heads, although decided upon by the 
United States--or jointly by the United States and Russia--was 
done at the Israelis' request, as our office in Washington 
reported yesterday. Our correspondent told us that Israel asked 
for the postponement for two reasons: 
  1. To try to hold secret talks with Syria parallel to the 
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Oslo. The [London-based] AL-HAYAH 
reported this, citing Syrian sources. It said the Israeli 
negotiators have asked for secret negotiations, but the Syrians 
have been categorically rejecting any secret contacts or any 
departure from the course of the negotiations as established in 
Madrid and continued in Washington. 
  2. To take a break to assess the results of Geneva summit 
between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad. 
  These two reasons have been confirmed, as our correspondent 
told us in a direct telephone call this morning. He added a 
third reason: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] The two reasons 
have been confirmed, and our radio has learned of a third 
Israeli reason for the postponement: Raising the level of 
representation at the next round of talks. During their 
meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres asked U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher to try to get the 
concerned Arab parties, especially Syria and Lebanon, to raise 
the level of negotiations. [end recording] 
  Our correspondent said that no official date for the 
resumption of the 12th round of peace talks has been fixed. The 
negotiations will resume on 15 February at the chief delegates' 
level. 
  What did the State Department spokesman say? 
  [Begin correspondent recording] A State Department spokesman 
said that after consultations with the concerned parties, the 
cosponsors of the peace process proposed suspension of the peace 
talks being conducted at the chief delegate level for a short 
time to give the parties enough time to consult with their 
governments. The negotiations will resume on 15 February with 
the same format--at the chief delegate level. 
  The truth, however, is that the U.S. announcement is based 
on 
an Israeli request. Heads of the Arab delegations, therefore, 
are dissatisfied. In our conversations with them, the heads of 
the Lebanese and Syrian delegations did not show any enthusiasm 
for the decision, and they initially decided to stay in 
Washington during the hiatus and to contact their governments by 
telephone and facsimile. 
  The U.S. State Department spokesman ruled out the 
possibility 
that a tour of the Middle East by Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher is imminent. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--The Working Group on Arms 
Control and Regional Security emanating from the multilateral 
Middle East peace talks concluded its meetings in Cairo this 
evening. During its five days of meetings, the committee 
discussed the two issues of arms control and regional security 
arrangements. It also discussed working papers and ideas 
submitted by Egypt and Jordan and a joint Russian-American 
working paper, a compilation of what was discussed during the 
committee's previous meetings. 
  The group also discussed a paper submitted by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency on measures to inspect 
nuclear weapons. 
  During the meetings, members also formulated a joint paper 
to 
be presented to Mideast capitals to form an official opinion and 
prepare for the paper's presentation during the meetings of the 
General Committee slated to start in Doha at the end of April. 
  MENA has learned that the coming meeting of the second 
working group will be held in Turkey during March to prepare for 
the meetings of the General Committee. 
  Some 19 countries, including the United States and Russia, 
will participate in the meetings of the Arms Control Committee.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 4 Feb (MENA)--Ambassador Nabil Fahmi, 
adviser to the foreign minister and chairman of the Egyptian 
delegation to the meetings of the Working Group on Arms Control 
and Regional Security stemming from the multilateral Middle East 
peace talks, stated that Egypt has expressed its willingness to 
host the proposed Middle East Regional Communications Center 
once the parties to the multilaterals agree to set it up. He 
explained that the center will serve the cause of arms control 
and regional security. 
  At a news conference last night following the working 
group's 
five-day meetings, Fahmi said the meetings addressed several 
issues in an in-depth discussion to define the long-term goals 
involving all the parties concerned in the region. He noted 
that discussions will resume at subsequent meetings. 
  He pointed out that the discussion touched on an attempt to 
launch a project concerning "a declaration on regional security 
and arms control in the Middle East," outlining the general 
principles that should govern security ties among regional 
states in time of peace. 
  Fahmi added that the talks discussed specific principles 
concerning regional security arrangements, the rules that should 
govern arms control, and the objectives the parties concerned 
seek to achieve in the field of arms control. 
  He added that the Cairo meetings achieved an initial success 
beyond that which the proposed working paper sought to achieve. 
But, he remarked, particular points need to be given form and 
the delegations need time to submit the working paper to their 
governments before the working group can publicize it. 
  The chairman of the Egyptian delegation pointed out that the 
talks also discussed the necessary measures to verify military 
activities in their various aspects, since this verification is 
fundamental to build confidence and to reach an agreement on 
arms control. It is a means of ensuring that all the parties 
are honoring their commitments, he said. 
  Fahmi said the working group discussed a Russian proposal to 
establish a data bank on regional security and arms control as 
well as another proposal to establish a regional crisis 
management center and a regional communications center. [passage 
omitted] 
  Fahmi was asked about particular delegations' objections to 
the joint Russian-U.S. paper that was submitted during the 
meetings. He explained that the proposed paper was neither 
American nor Russian but a compilation of the views expressed by 
regional states at previous meetings. Naturally, some states 
suggested some amendments, he remarked, adding: Tangible 
progress was made on many aspects of the items included in the 
working paper. The United States and Russia put forward a joint 
working paper on arms control at the beginning of the meetings 
but the Palestinians objected to it, noting that it was an 
attempt to give new interpretations to established political 
principles. 
  Ambassador Fahmi was asked about the Israeli concentration 
on 
the issue of regional security and its overlooking the arms 
control aspect. Fahmi replied that it is natural for each party 
to have its own priorities. What we saw at these meetings was a 
wide and exhaustive discussion of the various issues, including 
regional security arrangements and arms control arrangements, he 
said. He remarked that several delegations took part in the 
discussion in accordance with their stances. 
  At the news conference, Fahmi pointed out that Israel took 
part in discussing every subject. We can say that the Israeli 
delegation demonstrated its readiness to discuss issues. We 
hope the coming meetings will procure a working paper that helps 
take real steps to curb armament, he said. 
  Fahmi stated that the next working group meeting will be 
held 
in Turkey in March. But he added that it will be exclusive to 
regional states and that an expanded meeting will be held in the 
Qatari capital for both regional and nonregional states.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, Al Nowar [Feb] 4 -- JAMAHIRIYA NEWS 
AGENCY -- The assistant secretary general of the Arab League has 
called for the lifting of the harsh measures imposed on the 
Great Jamahiriyah by resolutions manipulated through the 
so-called `Security' Council. He said that the continuation of 
these sanctions would be a blatant injustice and a mockery of 
small nations, principles of international law and the United 
Nations Charter. 
  In a speech to the 59th session of ministers of the 
Organisation of African Unity in Addis Ababa, the assistant 
secretary general of the Arab League said that we call for all 
resolutions adopted by the Arab League, the Organisation for 
African Unity, the Islamic Conference Organisation and the 
Nonaligned Movement to be complied with.

  [Text] Bucharest, Feb. 3, IRNA -- Iranian and Romanian 
foreign ministers discussed issues relevant to the security and 
unity of the European countries as well as developments in 
central Asia in their second round of talks here today. 
  A source close to the talks said that Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Viorel Melescanu had raised the issue of 
cooperation between the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) 
which grouped Iran and nine neighbours, and the Organization of 
the Black Sea Littoral States. 
  The two decided the issue should be followed up by the 
secretariats of the two organizations, the source added. 
  Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and his 
Romanian 
counterpart inked two political and trade agreements as well as 
a plan on the scientific, educational, cultural and art 
exchanges at the end of the meeting. 
  Talking to reporters after the meeting, Velayati said the 
agreements reached by the two countries showed that the two were 
keen to further expand their ties. 
  Asked about the attempted assassination against President 
Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani last Tuesday, Velayati condemned 
terrorism, and expressed pleasure that the terrorist act had 
failed. 
  He also said that Islamic Iran would spare no efforts in the 
way of the establishment of a just and honorable peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] The Islamic Jihad in Palestine has issued a 
statement on the intifadah entering its 77th month, in which it 
hails the heroic people of the intifadah, their great 
sacrifices, and their confrontation of the treasonous agreement. 
It praised the Alliance of Palestinian Forces. It said that 
this alliance constitutes a political drive of the large-scale 
massive rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and is solid 
ground for unifying our people in their confrontation of the 
dangers threatening them. 
  The Islamic Jihad statement added: Toppling those who are 
negotiating with the Zionists in the name of our people requires 
an extensive popular action to prove to the whole world that 
this desperate team does not represent our people, and 
therefore, cannot determine their future. This team's 
agreements are not binding on our people. We must all move 
within cohesive national ranks to show the whole world that 
those negotiators only represent themselves and parochial 
interests. 
  The Islamic Jihad in Palestine called on the valiant people 
of the revolution to direct their bullets to the chests of the 
occupiers. 
  On the occasion of the blessed month of Ramadan, the month 
of 
jihad and sacrifices, it said: We call on all the sons of our 
people to strictly adhere to God's teachings, to safeguard the 
sanctity of the blessed month, to abide by the principles of the 
true religion, to carry out more acts of jihad, and to escalate 
the intifadah activities. It declared 6 February a day of 
comprehensive strike and popular indignation all over Palestine.

  [Text] The Central Committee of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has sent a 
cable of greetings to the members of the Central Committee of 
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], on 
the DFLP's 25th anniversary. 
  The cable says: To the dear comrades, you know these 
national occasions, in the book of national strugglers and 
revolutionaries of national liberation, provide a good 
opportunity for assessment of past achievements in their 
struggle. 
  This anniversary comes amid very complicated and difficult 
circumstances brought about by international, regional, Arab, 
and national developments fraught with dangers that target all 
of us, Arabs and Muslims. The results of these developments and 
the way we respond to them will determine the fate of our 
people's cause, their rights, and national existence, as well as 
the fate of the rights of Arabs and Muslims, their present, 
future, and national, regional, and human role. 
  The cable adds: Historic responsibility entails missions to 
be performed by all Arab and Islamic forces that are committed 
to the defense of inalienable, historic rights and that are 
aware of the comprehensive visible dangers. The purpose of this 
is to foil plans to recognize the Zionist enemy and normalize 
relations with it, support Palestinian national steadfastness in 
the face of the conspiracy, and emphasize the Arab and Islamic 
dimension of the cause and the conflict. We think that our 
present situation and national performance play a major role in 
the nation's awakening to assume its responsibilities.

<F P=106> [Ruba al-Husari report: "After the Clinton-al-Asad Meeting </F>
and With the Possibility of Peace Between Syria and Israel, the 
Palestinian Opposition in Damascus Prepares To Shift Its Main 
Weight to the Occupied Territory"] 
  [Text] Occupied Jerusalem -- As the momentum of 
Arab-Israeli negotiations increases, particularly after the 
meeting between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton which 
opened the way for the return of Syria and Israel to the 
negotiating table in Washington, the Palestinian resistance 
based in Damascus finds itself at a crossroads and might be 
compelled to speed up the transfer of its political and struggle 
weight from the diaspora to the occupied territory. 
  Supporters of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [PFLP], the largest opposition faction, which is based 
in Damascus and shares internal opposition influence with Hamas, 
say that the process of gradually shifting the leadership to the 
occupied territory actually began last year in implementation of 
the PFLP's fifth general congress resolutions. But the 
al-Asad-Clinton meeting came as a warning that the conclusion of 
a peace treaty between Israel and Syria would occur sooner than 
the PFLP leaders had originally expected. 
  The branches of the Damascus-based Palestinian opposition 
factions in the occupied territory were worried when al-Asad and 
Clinton met in Geneva in mid-January. Some of them admitted 
that the opposition card would have a price and that the Syrian 
president would demand that price, particularly as the request 
for muzzling that opposition is primarily an Israeli request. 
Representatives of the various Palestinian factions in the 
occupied territory have jokingly wondered about the next 
station, and some suggested Yemen while others mentioned "even 
Iran." 
  One of them said that "it is natural for any Arab leader to 
put his interests before any other interests, and nobody can 
claim that Syria has carried the Palestinian opposition on its 
shoulders or that it has defended that opposition." 
Representatives of these trends rule out the possibility of any 
future confrontation with Damascus for signing an agreement with 
Israel, and they believe that the natural choice would be to 
look for another host state "where there are no Israeli 
representatives and no threat to our lives." 
  A PFLP official added: "Our options are very limited. The 
first priority is having the command headquarters in the cordon 
states, but as these states are now leaning toward signing an 
agreement with Israel, that would leave only the second tier of 
cordon states, namely Sudan and Iraq, which is out of the 
question at the present time." 
  The first warning the Damascus-based factions had since the 
Palestinian resistance left Lebanon in 1982 was the 1991 Madrid 
conference, when the cordon states -- that is Syria, Lebanon, 
and Jordan -- and the Palestinians met face to face with Israeli 
representatives. It took some of these factions, such as the 
PFLP led by George Habash, two years to acknowledge the need to 
reverse the equation it had applied until then and to recognize 
the importance of shifting its centrifugal political and 
leadership weight to the occupied territory, particularly as the 
burden of the opposition there would increase with the [PLO] 
Tunis leadership moving to the occupied territory. 
  Riyad al-Maliki, considered to be the PFLP's official 
spokesman in the occupied territory, says: "If Syria signed an 
agreement with Israel within a short period of time, that would 
surprise us, but if that did occur and the process of 
transferring the leadership had reached an advanced stage, there 
would be no problems." 
  The talk about moving the leadership to the occupied 
territory does not include Front officials moving from Damascus 
or other Arab capitals to Gaza, Jericho, or other parts of the 
West Bank. It rather means that the size of the responsibility 
falling on the shoulders of those in the occupied territory and 
their duties would increase in the next phase, in which a 
Palestinian national autonomy authority would emerge, and these 
responsibilities and duties would outweigh the tasks of the 
leadership abroad. 
  The PFLP in the occupied territory is still maintaining 
secrecy regarding the names and ranks of its leaders in the 
occupied territory, particularly those still unknown to the 
occupation authorities, unlike Fatah which has revealed all its 
cards since the signing of the Declaration of Principles with 
Israel. 
  A PFLP official says: "We will not become a public party, 
nor will we reveal our organizational structure, not even after 
the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. That 
is, first, because we have to take into consideration the 
possibility that the agreement might fail and, second, because 
we still do not know what position the future authority would 
take regarding the opposition and to what extent its 
coordination with the occupation authorities would have a 
bearing on the repressive measures used." 
  Al-Maliki, who was the PFLP's spokesman during the occupied 
territory's intifadah, which began in 1987, and got automatic 
immunity on the basis of his meetings with diplomats 
representing Western states (not Americans), says that the 
mechanism of the opposition's work will change as the 
Palestinians enter the new phase of implementation. He points 
out that "we now see nothing except negotiations under 
occupation. That is why we have to address public opinion and 
expose the danger of the agreement signed with Israel, but we 
cannot prevent anyone from negotiating or arriving at a formula 
of some kind." He adds: "When the implementation begins there 
will emerge a reality that we would have to confront and we will 
not be content with just writing articles in the press or 
addressing the masses but will use the direct method."

  [Text] Brother Abu-Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the 
state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, 
last night received the Russian ambassador in Tunis who conveyed 
to him a message from the Russian leadership. 
  Brother President Abu-Ammar asked the ambassador to convey a 
message to the Russian leadership on the Israeli-Palestinian 
talks in Davos and Israel's attempts to delay implementation of 
the Declaration of Principles. 
  The meeting was also an opportunity to review the various 
stages of the peace process and the worsening situation in the 
occupied territories as a consequence of the occupation and 
Israel's violation of Palestinians' human rights.

  [Text] Gaza -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chief Palestinian 
negotiator at the Taba talks, described yesterday the meetings 
in Davos between Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres as being on the level of 
responsibility. He said those meetings produced positive results 
which three months of talks with Israeli negotiators could not 
produce. Sha'th expressed the belief that what was achieved in 
Davos was the most that the Palestinians could achieve. He 
said: Today we are very close, closer than some might think, to 
reaching an agreement ensuring the beginning of implementation 
of the declaration of principles. 
  Sha'th, however, refused to say when he expects a final 
agreement to be signed, adding: Our negotiating experience with 
the Israelis makes it difficult for us to set any timeframe. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Sha'th said: We should 
always remember that we are in a transitional stage in which the 
Israelis will maintain their presence in two points -- the 
settlements and the borders. It was agreed in the Declaration 
of Principles to call those points "foreign security and the 
settlements' security." We succeeded in confining this presence 
to the narrowest possible geographic area with the provision 
that there will be a Palestinian presence opposite the Israeli 
presence. Sha'th stressed that the Davos accord preserved 
Palestinian personal and national dignity. 
  On whether the prisoners' issue was raised at the 
'Arafat-Peres talks, he said: We are talking about an overall 
agreement that includes a reasonable timetable for releasing all 
Palestinian prisoners, without exception.

<F P=106> [By 'Ala' al-Mashahrawi] </F>
  [Text] Gaza -- Dr. Zakariya al-Agha has disclosed that 
immediately upon the signing of an agreement with Israel, the 
Palestinian leadership will announce the members of the 
Palestinian transitional government -- the interim national 
authority. 
  Dr. Zakariya al-Agha stressed that the Palestinians are able 
to manage the Gaza Strip's affairs less than 48 hours after the 
Israeli forces withdraw from there. 
  Al-Agha pointed out that most Palestinian civil agencies, 
especially the police, education, and health are now in place 
and that specialized Palestinian cadres from within and abroad 
will run these agencies upon the withdrawal of Israeli forces. 
  Al-Agha condemned remarks attributed to an Israeli military 
commander and published in an Israeli newspaper to the effect 
that the Israeli forces will not be able to withdraw before 13 
April. Al-Agha said: Despite the fact that I am not a military 
man, I believe that the Israeli forces can withdraw within one 
month. They have now about two-and-a half-months until that 
date and they can implement withdrawal during this period 
without any obstacles. 
  Al-Agha expressed his displeasure over a possible delay in 
the withdrawal date, because exceeding the date set for this 
purpose will represent a grave and unsound indication by the 
Israelis, who now have adequate time for withdrawing. 
  Al-Agha denied rumors on the existence of differences within 
Fatah in the Gaza Strip. He said that Fatah is gaining strength 
daily and is becoming more cohesive and resolute and that its 
members are aware of their current historic responsibility. 
  Al-Agha expressed his complete pleasure at the democratic 
dialogue conducted by the engineers from Fatah and Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] which resulted in forming a joint 
board of management, because this epitomizes the Palestinian 
people's spirit of cooperation, democracy, and great 
responsibility. 
  He added: This is a living example that it is possible to 
form a Palestinian government from among the Palestinian forces 
participating in the arena. He emphasized that the Palestinian 
leadership calls on every Palestinian to join the coming 
authority. 
  Al-Agha underscored the need to hold elections at their 
scheduled date so that the people will choose their 
representatives in a democratic and fair manner in the first 
Palestinian national authority in the Palestinian people's 
history.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to PLO Chairman </F>
Yasir 'Arafat, by correspondent Huda al-Husayni in London; date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Sharif] There is no doubt that the delay in the 
implementation of the first-step agreement will make the 
Palestinians and the Arabs doubt the seriousness of the Israeli 
Government's stand. Furthermore, the continuation of occupation 
and shooting at Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank 
will draw more resistance. This will renew the cycle of 
violence and endanger the whole agreement. 
  [Al-Husayni] Some people say the continuation of violence in 
the occupied territory will prompt a negative Israeli reaction 
and make it refuse to implement this agreement. 
  [Abu-Sharif] The fact is that the cycle of violence was 
generated by the presence of occupation and the shooting at 
Palestinians by Israeli soldiers, not the opposite. Palestinian 
reaction is a legitimate and human resistance. 
  [Al-Husayni] Hamas, however, has been accused of killing 
Israelis. 
  [Abu-Sharif] The reaction of the Palestinians -- students, 
women, men, and old men -- is a reaction to Israeli measures, 
not the opposite. This is the reaction of the Palestinian 
people. 
  [Al-Husayni] Israeli officials have been stating that they 
are concerned about Israel's security. Why was the agreement 
concluded in the first place if it would endanger Israel's 
security? 
  [Abu-Sharif] We understand Israelis' fears regarding their 
security. However, they should understand that we also have our 
own fears regarding the security issue. It is our people who 
are in need of protection. We can conclude by saying that our 
people will continue the resistance as long as the occupation 
continues. 
  [Al-Husayni] My last question is the following: Did Yasir 
'Arafat really dispatch some of his personal guards for training 
in the United States? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I do not know whether they were dispatched to 
the United States specifically, however, I know that quite a 
good number of the presidential guards are receiving training in 
more than one Western country.

  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- An authoritative source 
at the Palestinian embassy in Amman yesterday denied reports of 
the uncovering of a plot to assassinate Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat during his visit to Amman last month. 
  The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that these reports are 
absolutely baseless and unfounded. The source added that he had 
no information about reports that Jordanian security forces had 
arrested a Palestinian group armed with shoulder-mounted rockets 
prepared for launching in the direction of 'Arafat's aircraft as 
it landed in Amman civilian airport. 
  For their part, Jordanian security sources have declined to 
comment on the report, which was published by a local newspaper.

  [Text] Fighting has decreased between rival groups in 
Afghanistan. Our correspondent reports from Islamabad. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Kabul was relatively calm today 
with clouds, rain, and snow calming clashes between rival groups. 
  Meanwhile a source close to the government of Borhanoddin 
Rabbani reported attacks by government fighter planes on the 
northern Afghan airport of Jozjan. 
  The source who is close to Rabbani, also emphasized that 
forces supporting the president will not agree to a fresh 
temporary cease-fire in the current fighting. 
  The coordination council in opposition to Rabbani's 
government announced last night that, following a request by the 
UN secretary general's special envoy in Afghan affairs, the 
opposition was ready to accept a four-day cease-fire on the 
condition that negotiations would concentrate on the resignation 
of Rabbani from his post. 
  In reply to this suggestion by the opposition, the source, 
Seyyed Habib Shah Hamed, emphasized that Rabbani will hold the 
presidential post until the end of his term. 
  Meanwhile the Kabul Jihadi commanders and a 100-strong 
mediation group from east Afghanistan, led by Maulawi 
Jallalulddin Haqani, who have spent three days in Kabul, 
continued their negotiations today with the representatives of 
President Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, and 
tried to prepare and propose a mediating plan that would be 
acceptable to both sides so as to prepare the grounds for 
negotiations and an understanding between the president and the 
prime minister of Afghanistan.

  [Text] Throughout the course of history Afghanistan has 
been the center of the greatest human civilizations, and its 
people ruled a part of the region for many centuries. Now too 
they are capable of resolving their problems. BAKHTAR's 
political commentator writes: 
  The experience of the past 19 months in Afghanistan reveals 
that the mediation efforts of Afghanistan's neighbor 
extinguished the fire of war for a limited period. A few days 
later the fire of war has been rekindled and is destroying the 
people. To cut the roots of fighting for good and to create a 
reliable calm in the country, it is necessary for the mojahedin 
to come together and resolve their problems. 
  Despite the fact that the Islamic State of Afghanistan 
respects the efforts of all peace seekers and well-wishers and 
follows their proposals to the best of its abilities, this time 
it wants a cease-fire to take effect with the party of Golboddin 
Hekmatyar through an understanding inside the country. But the 
jihadi parties should not support the atheist and infamous 
militia, nor should they provide grounds for their further 
existance. The Jalalabad agreement and the Mecca Convention 
resolved the problem of Afghanistan in a shallow and temporary 
way -- the roots of fighting and the problems stayed and so we 
saw a resumption of the fighting. The important point is that 
the other side accepts negotiations only after suffering defeat 
militarily. Now the putschist coup d'etat has failed and 
Dostam's militia have lost their positions and fortifications. 
The supremacy of the state has been established following the 
downing of eight aircraft by the air force of the Islamic State 
of Afghanistan and the destruction of six aircraft on the ground. 
  Outside the country, too, the Babrak-Dostam-Golboddin 
triangle's political effforts have failed. This anomalous and 
unnatural coalition created such an atmosphere for themselves, 
both militarily and internationally, that they should be 
considered as having no specific identity or policy. Even 
international observers have been faced with uncertainty about 
the real identity of this triangle -- the public alliance of the 
Muslim extremist Golboddin with very infamous communists. 
  From the outset the Islamic State of Afghanistan has stated 
its policy in this battle: a cease-fire with the mojahedin of 
Hezb-e Eslami and continuation of the jihad until the 
elimination of Dostam's militia. And no one is as well 
qualified as the Afghans themselves to draft the details of a 
cease-fire and its implementation.

<F P=106> [Article by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan: "Afghan Opposition </F>
Dispatches Delegation to Saudi Arabia and Iran to Express Its 
Opinion"] 
  [Text] Peshawar--An Afghan opposition delegation is 
preparing to go to Saudi Arabia and Iran to familiarize the two 
countries' officials with the opposition's demands and with its 
proposals to settle the crisis between itself and President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that the delegation, which represents 
the High Coordination Council for the Islamic Revolution, 
includes 'Abdol Hadi Arghandwal as representative of the Hezb-e 
Eslami (led by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar); 
Hashamatollah Mojaddedi on behalf of the Islamic National 
Liberation Front (led by Sebghatollah Mojaddedi); Dr. Talib on 
behalf of the (pro-Tehran) Shiite Hezb-e Wahdat; and 'Abdol 
Samad on behalf of the Uzbek militias. 
  The delegation will leave for Tehran today and will proceed 
for Riyadh from there, carrying with it the opposition's 
leaders' visions and viewpoint on settling the crisis. 
  The delegation has met with Pakistani Foreign Minister 
Sardar 
Asif Ali and ambassadors of the [UN] Security Council member 
states, in addition to heads of the Islamic states' diplomatic 
missions in the Pakistani capital. 
  The meeting was held at a time when opposition sources have 
said that the Pakistani foreign minister has agreed in principle 
to the opposition plan that calls for the resignation of the 
president and his prime minister simultaneously, for withdrawal 
of the armed elements from the capital, and for forming a 
provisional council to manage the country's affairs until 
elections are held. 
  Meanwhile, the two parties to the conflict have continued 
their military preparations at a time when fierce fighting has 
been raging on between them in Kabul. AL-HAYAH has learned that 
Hekmatyar has told Afghan notables who met with him recently 
that he is about to complete building a military airfield in 
Surkhab, south of Kabul. 
  This is the second airfield constructed by Hekmatyar in the 
areas under his control. The first airfield, built two weeks ago 
in Dasht-e Saqawa, near Char Asiab (where Hekmatyar lives), was 
subjected to missile attacks launched by the government forces. 
But the new airfield is located beyond the government missiles' 
range and it can accommodate fighter aircraft, contrary to the 
old airfield, which can only accommodate passenger and freight 
aircraft. 
  Informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that Surkhab Airfield 
has 
been fitted with a very sophisticated radar capable of 
monitoring the airspace extending to the Pakistani border. It is 
well known that the Surkhab Airfield plan has been ready since 
the days of former President Mohammad Daud (1973-78) and that 
this airport was supposed to be an alternative to the current 
Kabul Airport. 
  Moreover, battles continued between government and 
opposition 
forces yesterday and military aircraft controlled by General 
'Abdol Rashid Dostam, the Uzbek militias' commander, raided 
artillery positions in central and northern Kabul for the second 
consecutive day. 
  The aircraft targeted the hill on which the television tower 
is built and where artillery pieces belonging to (pro-Rabbani) 
former Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, whose faction 
controls the central part of the Afghan capital militarily, are 
deployed.

<F P=106> [From the "Ghare Bahire" column by Sandhani] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton has delivered his first 
`State of the Union' speech. In this speech, the President 
referred to the past and also spoke about the future. He did 
not bother about the present. Perhaps, Clinton did so because 
the present is very temporary while the future is everlasting. 
  According to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the 
president must give the State of the Union speech every year. 
George Washington and John Adams used to come personally to the 
Congress to deliver their speech. Their successors used to send 
their written speech to the Congress and these were read out. 
This practice continued for almost 100 years. Later, during 
the rule of President Wilson and President Franklin, the 
previous practice of the president coming to the Congress to 
deliver his State of the Union speech started again. This 
system is continuing till today. 
  The State of the Union speech is very important as it 
focuses 
on issues relating to the domestic and foreign policies of the 
United States. President Clinton has also referred to both 
domestic issues and foreign policy matters in his speech. He 
dwelt at length on the steps taken by his administration during 
the past year and also elaborated on the plans of his government 
for the current year. The President did not make any attempts 
to hide his failures. This distinguishes a leader of a 
developed country from those of the developing countries. 
Referring to his election pledges, the President said that a 
pragmatic budget was formulated last year with a view to 
bringing economic discipline to the country. He also referred to 
the signing of the NAFTA and GATT accords. President Clinton 
categorically stated that no compromise with national interests 
have been made in any sector. He claimed that the number of job 
opportunities created by his government over the past year 
exceeded those created in the previous four years. The President 
also gave an outline of the programs taken up by his government 
for the year 1994. He said the new programs are aimed at 
creating more job opportunities, improving health care 
facilities, curbing the crime rate, and preventing drug abuse. 
The President further stated that expenditures in over 300 
programs will be curtailed and 100 domestic projects will be 
ended in order to develop the economy. He, however, stated that 
there will be no reduction in the military budget and added that 
the efficiency of the armed forces will remain unchanged so that 
they can face any situation. 
  Dwelling on foreign policy, the President said that the 
United States would continue to extend its assistance for the 
cause of democracy and the protection of human rights. He also 
stated that U.S. support for economic reforms in Russia will 
continue. But he did not elaborate on whether any emergency 
assistance will be provided to Russia. It may be mentioned that 
the Second World War did not only lead to the downfall of German 
fascism, but also shattered the economy of several European 
countries. According to some historians, the Second World War 
was won by Britain, but it lost its colonies. Similar was the 
fate suffered by the Dutch, the Portuguese, and the French, who 
also lost their empires. After the war, the Indian subcontinent 
also became independent. Mandatory Western rule came to an end 
in several countries of the Middle East and an armed struggle 
was launched in Africa to overthrow the white rule. After the 
Second World War, the Europeans did not have the power to hold 
on to their colonies. Their condition was precarious. As a 
result, Churchill lost the elections held in his country. At 
that time only the United States was unaffected by the war and 
it earned a lot of money by selling arms. After the war, the 
United States under the "Marshall Aid" program funneled huge 
assistance to Europe and helped the war ravaged countries 
rebuild themselves. Though the former Soviet Union was the worst 
affected by the war, it did not receive any assistance. During 
the war it had to fight to protect every inch of land in 
Leningrad and Stalingrad. At the end Stalin himself took over 
the command of the army and was able to change the course of the 
war by his wisdom, farsightedness, and military strategy. 
Later, some scholars opined that Stalin committed some blunders 
and said that the present day Russia is the outcome. Massive 
assistance is needed for the development of the Russia. 
President Clinton has admitted this, but he has not given any 
hint regarding "Marshall Aid" to Russia. 
  We should not emulate everything which takes place in the 
United States. But the modern world is so small that it is very 
difficult to keep our eyes shut. We have to import everything 
-- not only the design of bridges and roads, but also fashion. 
If we look closely it could be observed that we import more bad 
things in comparison to the good ones. It is difficult to say 
whether we will be able to learn some good lessons from the 
State of the Union speech made by President Clinton. While 
dwelling on the programs of his government, President Clinton 
did not criticize former governments. He has only stated what 
he has done and what he intends to do. His speech also 
reflected the priority given by him to the interests of his 
nation. He has given emphasis on the creation of more job 
opportunities, curtailing expenditure, and preventing misuse of 
funds. The President also did not hesitate to tell his 
countrymen that there is no alternative to hard work for the 
development of the country. There is nothing new in what he has 
said. Everybody knows that hard work is the key to progress. 
The leaders of the Third World countries are also aware of it. 
We have seen that the GATT talks were about to fail due to the 
conflicting interests of different countries, including the 
United States, France, and Italy. In spite of this, however, 
none of the negotiators sacrificed the interests of their 
respective countries. They did so because employment 
opportunities will shrink if they fail to develop trade and 
industry. It may be said that creation of employment 
opportunities is the most important yardstick for measuring the 
success or failure of a government. 
  The full text of the State of the Union speech by President 
Clinton has not been published in any newspaper of our country. 
There is a lot to learn from portion of his speech which has 
been published. But, will we learn any lessons from his speech?

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres confirmed today that 
he would meet PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 7 February in Cairo. 
The meeting between the two men was supposed to take place 
Sunday but was postponed. In their meeting, Peres and 'Arafat 
will try to overcome the last obstacles to the IDF's [Israel 
Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  Peres added that he expected that the agreement signed with 
the PLO in September would be implemented in full by the end of 
1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Shim'on Schiffer and Nahum Barne'a] </F>
  [Excerpt] Senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers 
believe it is time to create a crisis in the negotiations with 
'Arafat in order to make it clear that Israel does not intend to 
implement any more compromises in the talks with him. 
  It has been learned that in internal consultations with 
Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq commented on 
the need for "creating a wall to block 'Arafat, an impregnable 
iron wall wrapped in cotton." 
  The chief of staff, Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, Head 
of IDF Intelligence Uri Sagi and other senior defense 
establishment personnel have leveled sharp criticism at the way 
in which negotiations with the PLO are being conducted and 
maintain that Israel's positions are being undermined. 
  At the same time it is necessary to emphasize that the top 
IDF echelon is not opposed to the agreement with the PLO. 
  This morning the prime minister will consult with the chief 
of staff, the deputy chief of staff, the head of IDF 
intelligence, and senior security officials on the negotiations 
with the PLO. Next Monday [7 February], after the foreign 
minister's return from abroad, Rabin will hold an extensive 
consultations in anticipation of Shim'on Peres' departure for 
Cairo to meet with Yasir 'Arafat. 
  It has been learned that in the internal discussions, Peres 
derided "the almost obsessive occupation" with details by the 
defense establishment. Peres said that a year from now nobody 
will remember the details that the IDF is demanding to include 
in the agreement with the PLO. 
  Contrary to Peres, the top IDF echelon believes the 
agreement 
with the PLO must include as many details as possible in order 
to ensure the success of the agreement in the field. The 
position expressed to the prime minister by the IDF echelon was 
as follows: "The stage of constructive ambiguity and brilliant 
formulations is over. We have reached the implementation stage. 
It is impossible to settle for principles while skimping on 
details. The day after the agreement is implemented we will 
have to give platoon commanders and Palestinian policemen 
accurate instructions to follow. We are dealing here with 
thousands of people, and the Israeli public must also be 
informed." [passage omitted]

and Eytan remarked: Look at them pouncing on the corpses. 
Eytan told the Bat Yam branch members that this was what they 
would look like tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Hanan 'Azran] </F>
  [Text] Opponents of the regime in Congo are operating in 
Israel in an attempt to recruit Army personnel and rich 
businessmen to carry out a coup against Prime Minister Andre 
Milongo. Our correspondent has obtained secret documents in 
which the coup's initiators offer tremendous incentives to 
Israelis who will invest money in financing the revolution. 
They also promised $15 million in exchange for engineering the 
coup. 
  In a world of dubious business dealings, even bizarre 
schemes 
like this can sometimes be true. Therefore, a business venture 
seeking investors in a revolution should also be taken 
seriously. In the situation which has now arisen, Israelis may 
find themselves facing each other on the battlefield. In an 
attempt to maintain maximum secrecy, a representative of the 
underground in Congo-Brazzaville, sent a facsimile from 
Montreal, Canada explaining the offer to a senior Israeli 
reserves officer. Israel television is keeping the man's 
identity secret. The representative identifies himself as a 
political figure, with a PhD. He is looking for military 
experts in Israel who will be willing to carry out a coup for 
$15 million. He is also proposing that Israeli investors 
finance the revolution in return for huge incentives which 
include, he claims, diamond and gold mining rights in western 
Congo as well as 100 percent interest on their money. The 
payment of course will be made after the revolution and after 
the rebels take control of Congo's banks and foreign currency 
reserves. 
  The Congolese doctor includes maps in his proposal in which 
he marks out the areas under the control of his supporters, the 
areas controlled by the government, and the areas controlled by 
the prime minister's men. He notes that the Israeli embassy in 
Congo is aware of the underground's strength and capabilities. 
The situation becomes more complex when one recalls that 
Israelis are already involved in the training and equipping of 
the Congolese security forces. This involvement is the private 
initiative of a public investment firm, known as Carden 
Investments, whose offices are situated in Ramat Gan. A Carden 
subsidiary, Levran, recruited dozens of army officers and 
veterans of the Israeli security forces and sent them to Congo. 
Carden claims that it received the Defense Ministry's 
authorization to implement the deal. As reported by YEDI'OT 
AHARONOT, the head of the company is reserves Brigadier General 
Ze'ev Zakharin, who is considered an expert in training foreign 
armies. If the new revolution initiative takes off, Israelis 
may find themselves at war with each other in Congo with one 
group helping the government's forces and the other plotting to 
overthrow the Congolese Government. If such a situation indeed 
comes to pass, it may have serious political and ethical 
ramifications at the very least. 
  [In the same broadcast, Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 
1 
Network in Hebrew adds that "there were many reactions to this 
evening's report on the involvement of Israelis in plans for a 
revolution in Congo. The Knesset State Audit Committee will 
convene again to hold a detailed discussion about the actions of 
the Israeli Embassy in Congo. Knesset Member [MK] Dan Tikhon, 
the committee's chairman, said that clear rules should be set 
with regard to defense related exports. Tikhon expressed fears 
that this would be a repeat of the Colombia affair [in which an 
Israeli company trained Colombian farmers suspected of belonging 
to a drug cartel]. Likud MK Silvan Shalom submitted an urgent 
motion to the agenda in which he demanded that Yitzhaq Rabin, 
the prime minister and defense minister, explain whether Israel 
had sent official advisers to Congo. Shalom also demanded that 
Rabin explain how reserve army officers, working for a private 
company, had received permission to leave for Congo to establish 
special units to support the regime there. In the wake of these 
revelations, Likud MK Avraham Herschson submitted an urgent 
motion to the agenda demanding that the defense minister 
investigate whether reserve Army officers or businessmen had any 
intention of accepting the proposal to finance or carry out a 
coup in Congo."]

<F P=106> [Report by Ben Segenreich] </F>
  [Text] [Segenreich] Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, who is 
currently visiting Israel, held talks today with Palestinian 
representatives. Aid projects for the future autonomous areas, 
among other things, were discussed. The Orient House is the 
headquarters of the PLO in East Jerusalem. Here, Erhard Busek 
started the third day of his visit to Israel. His Palestinian 
interlocutors were headed by Faysal al-Husayni, the PLO leader 
in the West Bank. He expressed both concerns and wishes. There 
are still numerous difficulties concerning the implementation of 
the autonomy, Al-Husayni pointed out. The Palestinians need 
political, financial, and technical support from Europe and 
Austria, he stressed. Money for the salaries of Palestinian 
officials is particularly urgently required. 
  The meeting with State President Ezer Weizman, one of the 
most brilliant figures in Israeli politics, was a highlight of 
Busek's visit. 
  Mr. Busek, the most important meetings of your visit to 
Israel have already taken place. What is your balance sheet so 
far? 
  [Busek] The balance is very positive for Austria. I believe 
that the relationship between Israel and Austria is excellent. 
After a difficult period in the past, good contacts and close 
friendship and cooperation have developed within a short period. 
  [Segenreich] A visit to several museums along with former 
Mayor Teddy Kollek was part of the relaxing part of the program. 
At Tel Aviv University, the vice chancellor delivered a major 
speech on the topic "Policy for Europe." He particularly 
stressed the Jewish contribution to European culture.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Report With No Practical Application"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. State Department's annual human rights 
report is not the first American report that talks about Israeli 
violations in the occupied territories. Its significance, 
however, lies in the fact that it was issued by a friendly 
party, not by a Palestinian or Arab party that can be accused of 
being biased, imbalanced, and lacking credibility. 
  The report mentioned torture and killings in the occupied 
territories before and after the signing of the Declaration of 
Principles, the special units and their activities, torture 
during interrogation, and the Israel Army's adoption of the 
posture of a spectator when settlers engage in their preferred 
pleasure -- attacking Palestinian residents and their 
properties. All these and other violations call into question 
the position of the United States, as it is the strategic ally, 
friend, and partner of a party that over the past years 
committed and continues to commit these violations. 
  Naturally, we are not demanding from the U.S. Administration 
punishment for the culprit. We do not dare call on the first 
military power in the world to deal with Israel in the tools and 
concepts of the Cold War, which are still in effect against 
Iraq, Libya, Cuba and other third world countries and movements 
that previously were proteges of the other bloc before its 
collapse. However, we are asking -- and this is our right -- 
about Washington's responsibility in these violations and 
whether it has done anything other than issue annual reports in 
a bid to stop or ease these violations. 
  In order to avoid leveling rash accusations against the 
neutral mediator and honest sponsor and prevent further 
misunderstandings, we suggest to the U.S. State Department -- in 
observance of reliability and sincerity -- that it clearly 
asserts in the preface that this report is only for propaganda 
and media purposes and that it should neither be quoted nor 
used, because it has no practical application.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN says: Israeli discourse on 
peace in the Middle East and the prospects for achieving it is 
lopsided. This discourse misrepresents facts, and is full of 
contradictions. 
  The paper discusses statements by Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, in which he said that the dispute with Syria 
concerns substantive issues, contending that the problem lies in 
the level of representation in the negotiations. 
  TISHRIN reacts to these statements, saying: If the problem 
concerns substance rather than form, why then this Israeli 
determination to continue to raise the issue of representation 
in the negotiations, particularly since the negotiations should 
not be an end in itself? As a matter of fact, the negotiations 
should be a means to achieve an end; namely, the attainment of 
just and comprehensive peace, which should not lend itself to 
various interpretations and over which there should be no 
bargaining. 
  TISHRIN adds: Middle East peace must be just and 
comprehensive. It must be grounded in the relevant international 
resolutions. It must also result in the return of the 
territories to their rightful Arab owners, as called for in the 
relevant UN Security Council resolutions, which provide for the 
complete Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories 
occupied in 1967; namely, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, and the 
Golan, not to mention the unconditional Israeli withdrawal from 
southern Lebanon in implementation of Resolution 425. 
  TISHRIN wonders: Why has Israel failed to respond to the 
ideas and principles reiterated by leader al-Asad at the Geneva 
summit--the very ideas and principles which were accepted and, 
indeed, espoused by the United States to accelerate the peace 
process? 
  The paper says: The United States has also acknowledged 
Syria's leading role in the peace process. The ball now is in 
the Israeli court. Israel is well aware that had it, at least, 
heeded the Madrid conference formula, and sincerely honored the 
provisions enshrined in the U.S. peace initiative, chief among 
which is the provision regarding the principle of exchanging 
land for peace, the peace process would not have run into all 
these snags, difficulties, and traps. Similarly, the peace 
process would not have reached a dead end. 
  In one of its articles, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on 
the evasive Israeli policy toward the peace process, saying: 
Israel, which has flooded the world with sweet words, 
particularly after the Labor Party assumed power, has concluded 
the Gaza-Jericho accord with the Palestinians to evade 
commitment to the peace process as outlined at the Madrid 
conference. 
  The paper adds: Israel forced its dictates and conditions in 
the vague Gaza-Jericho accord, the implementation of which has 
run into difficulties, although it is an Israeli formulation for 
Palestinian autonomy. Since the conclusion of this accord, 
Israel has been promoting partial settlements, contending that 
it needs time to digest the Oslo accord. This shows a desire on 
its part to evade commitment to the peace process. It is to be 
recalled that Israel showed a great reluctance to join this 
process in Madrid in the first place. 
  The paper addresses the Israeli stand toward the Syrian role 
in the peace process, saying: Israel has rediscovered that it 
cannot overlook Syria's role and position, which have been 
acknowledged by the U.S. Administration and the world at large. 
The entire world community has realized that Syria has a basic 
and important role to play on all tracks of the negotiations. 
This role is required if just and comprehensive peace is to be 
achieved, and if the region is to enjoy security and stability. 
  The paper concludes by saying: Syria has constantly 
reiterated its stand toward peace, which must be grounded in the 
relevant international legitimacy resolutions passed by the UN 
Security Council. This is essential if peace is to be just and 
comprehensive. Such peace will certainly benefit the region 
and the world at large.

  [Text] In Jammu and Kashmir, a government spokesman 
questioned the moral right of Pakistan Prime Minister Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto to take up the issue of human rights in Kashmir. 
He said Pakistan sponsored militants are the main violators of 
human rights. He pointed out that since January 1990, these 
militants have killed as many as 2,300 innocent civilians -- 
mostly Kashmiri Muslims -- and abducted more than 1,000 people.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ashok Sharma] </F>
  [Text] For over four years now, Pakistan has been turning 
all international meetings into a battleground to embarrass 
India, particularly on human rights issue. Constrained somewhat 
by the accepted of not raising bilateral issues at such 
gatherings, Pakistan has taken to raising the Kashmir issue 
under the garb of the alleged human rights violations in the 
valley. In this attempt Pakistan has been encouraged to a great 
extent by the Clinton administration making the human rights 
issue its major policy plank. A view seems to prevail in 
Islamabad that Washington can intercede on its behalf and force 
India to agree to a solution on terms favorable to Pakistan. 
Excelling her predecessor Mr. Nawaz Sharif in anti-India tirade, 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto's private attitude toward India has vitiated 
whatever atmosphere had been generated for good-neighborly ties 
in recent years. 
  Recently, the dispute drowned all hopes at the Human Rights 
Commission meeting at the Geneva with Ms. Bhutto stopping just 
short of calling for an all out war against India. Her aim 
seems to build pressure on the Human Rights Commission of the 
United Nations to pass a resolution against India. She said 
that success of any future talks between Islamabad and New Delhi 
had to be linked to the human rights situation in the Kashmir 
valley. Pakistan's insistence on the implementation of UN 
resolutions on Kashmir belied its intentions. Indian finance 
minister and leader of Indian delegation to the 50th session of 
the UN Human Rights Commission at Geneva, Dr. Manmohan Singh, 
exposed the game plan of Pakistan and said to this date 45 years 
later, Pakistan continues to remain in illegal occupation of 
one-third of Jammu and Kashmir in violation of the UN resolution 
and, therefore, there is no possibility for a plebiscite as a 
precondition of this said UN resolution demands that Pakistan 
will have to withdraw all its forces and tribal population from 
the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Accession of Jammu and Kashmir 
to India not only enjoys perfect legal validity, but had also 
been sanctified by a popular will. Seeking the support of the 
world community in its struggle against Pakistan's sponsored 
terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Manmohan Singh said that 
this externally inspired terrorism challenged India's 
territorial integrity and sought to divert its intentions from 
the basic task of nation-building. Lambasting Pakistan for 
misusing the UN forum to launch an uncalled- for tirade against 
India on human rights, he said that an index of India's 
commitment to human rights and the rule of law was the restraint 
shown during the Hazratbal crisis generated by the seizure of 
the holy shrine by Pakistan-supported terrorists. 
  Earlier, replying to Pakistani Prime Minister Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto's harp on human rights in Kashmir, former chief minister 
of jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, termed the propaganda 
as false and malicious and said that it was a well-planned 
attempt on her part to promote terrorism in the state with a 
view to grab it. He also reminded Pakistan of the tragic plight 
of the Ahmediyas, the Sindhis, Shi'ites, Christians and other 
minority communities in that country which is a telling 
commentary on Islamabad's concern for human rights. 
  Human rights in India are well protected. A national 
commission for human rights has been established which is quite 
powerful. Indian legal system also provided sufficient remedial 
framework of punishing human rights violations. Permanent under 
secretary of British Foreign Office, David Gillmore, who is on a 
visit to India has lauded the sensitivity of Indian Government 
toward human rights. He has praised India's continuing and ever 
greater transparency in Kashmir on human rights issue and called 
for strong action by international community against states who 
are guilty of cross border terrorism.

<F P=106> [Commentary by A. Karuppaswamy] </F>
  [Text] The Indo-German relations and cooperation in 
industry and scientific development has a new vigor with the 
visit of the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, to Germany. The 
Germans also take cognizance of the importance of such a visit 
when Germany is renewing its outside endeavor and enagement 
after two and a half years of internal problem of unification. 
Businessmen and industrialists along with the government were 
very busy during the last two years. Inactivities concerned 
with creating parity between the two Germanys radically opposed 
with each in everything except the geographical contiguity 
artificially separated by a manmade wall [sentence as heard]. 
  Germany is now looking for new grounds for investing and 
adequate return for their investment. The economic reforms 
toward globalization of market in India has made Germany 
immensely interested in collaboration. Mr. Narasimha Rao's 
assurance to the German industrialists that India is pressing 
ahead with economic reforms is a reassurance to many of them for 
removing their hesitation to open new units or financing Indian 
projects. The creation of an Asian-Pacific Committee of German 
Industry is a major step toward consolidating Indo-German 
cooperation. The low labor cost and skill of workers and the 
fairly unexploited market in India is the most potential market 
for German industrialists. The meeting between the prime 
minister and the federal minister for economic development and 
the German cochairman of the Indo-German Consultative Group in 
Bonn has paved the way for narrowing down some of the 
constraints. 
  India's largest trading partner and market for Indian export 
in Europe will further invite Indian exports of silk, textiles, 
leather, basic chemicals, precious stones and engineering item. 
On their side, investment in lignite-based power plants, joint 
ventures like power equipment and scientific and institutional 
establishments are some of the added German ventures in India 
contemplated immediately. The German Investment Development 
Company, which has an office in Bombay, is accelerating its 
involvement in speeding up implementing the 2,500 approved 
projects for collaboration. In all, Germany is expected to 
exploit the scheme with the potentials of 75,000 rupees. 
  Politically, the Indo-German relations are always cordial 
and 
consistent with adequate understanding in international fora. 
Germans are well aware of the fact that India was one among the 
first to establish diplomatic relations with Germany after the 
withdrawal of allied forces. The unequivocal stand of Germany 
on developments in Kashmir and its neutrality speaks of its 
noninterference in other country's affairs. Such friendly 
attitude and closer economic ties are bound to reflect in 
Indo-German growth as viable economic powers.

surveillance, provocation, and dropping of flares. 
  In a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali, Iraq noted

Iraqi airspace. Afterward, it flew in the direction of Saudi 
airspace. On 3 January [as heard], the same plane violated Iraqi 
airspace. It mainly overflew the al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah, 
al-'Amarah, southern al-Diwaniyah, and southern al-Najaf areas.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 3, INA -- A senior Ministry of 
Information and Culture aide has exposed means used by the 
United States and its allies, through their media, to prepare 
the atmosphere for war against Iraq well before January 17, 1991. 
  In a lecture he gave on the role of the Iraqi media during 
the war in the Gulf at the Iraqi Society for Libraries and 
Information here on Monday [31 January], Information 
Undersecretary Naji al-Hadithi said the Western media resorted 
to all means of distortion, depicting Iraq as an aggressive 
state. 
  The media, he said, claimed that Iraq was preparing to 
attack 
Saudi Arabia while Iraq had no intention whatsoever to launch 
such aggression. They also used the fabricated story of 
incubators in Kuwait which later proved to be a public relations 
ploy by the American Hill and Norton company. 
  Mr al-Hadithi said that the Western media also played an 
important role in foiling the diplomatic attempts to resolve the 
situation. Western media had communicated to the whole world 
that Iraq was against diplomatic attempts to solve the problem, 
while on the contrary Iraq wanted to sit down with Kuwaiti and 
Saudi officials to resolve the issue. 
  Mr al-Hadithi said the Western media had distorted the 
minutes of a meeting between President Saddam Husayn and the 
U.S. charge d'affaires in Baghdad. They said President Husayn 
had told the U.S. envoy that Saudi Arabia "is not far away and 
the use of force is our only means", al-Hadithi said, adding 
that such a statement is not in the minutes at all. 
  the undersecretary said the Iraqi media with its limited 
potentialities had to face huge media facilities of the West 
which were all directed against Iraq. He said three of the 33 
nations which launched the war against Iraq in 1991 possess the 
largest media establishments in the world. The U.S.A. possesses 
a large news agency, the Associated Press, Voice of America 
radio which dispatches its programmes in all languages, Mr 
al-Hadithi said, adding that the U.S. also possesses the largest 
television networks in the world such as CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS. 
  Britain also possesses big media means such as the BBC and 
REUTERS news agency while dispatch their news to hundreds of 
million of people in the world. France also has large media 
establishments, he added. 
  The undersecretary said the war against Iraq started with 
the 
idea in the West that Iraq was only a military camp full of 
nuclear and other weapons. Iraq's media means directed abroad 
had to change this Western image against Iraq, al-Hadithi said. 
  "Therefore, we allowed, as from September 20, 1990, few 
months before the war, hundreds of American, other Western and 
Arab journalists to come to Iraq and write about the real 
situation here". They visited historical sites, agricultural 
projects and eventually wrote about the normal life in Iraq. 
  Mr al-Hadithi said there was no way for planners of Iraq's 
media but to open the door wide for foreign journalists to come 
to the country before and during the war. 
  "While the U.S. and the allies had prevented journalists 
from 
visiting front lines in Saudi Arabia and enforced a heavy 
censorship on what they wrote or pictured, Iraq allowed 
journalists to go wherever there were U.S. and allied raids in 
various Iraqi provinces". 
  He said the U.S. Administration had tried to prevent Western 
journalists from staying in Baghdad in order not to report on 
the casualties among Iraqi civilians and the destruction of 
civilian facilities. He added that they invented a lie, namely 
that al- Rashid hotel, where foreign journalists used to stay 
during the war, was a bunker for Iraqi Army commanders and they 
threatened to attack it. All these propaganda means were used 
to force journalists to leave, al-Hadithi concluded.

  [Text] In a new development the Sudanese Government has 
opened new camps for Arab terrorists in al-Hassaniyah south of 
Shandi, a mountainous area with difficult terrain. The 
government dug several wells, reclaimed 5,000 feddans of land, 
and set up a number of farms to ensure provisions for the 
"Yarmuk," "al-Hudaybiyah," and "al-Qadisiyah" camps, where 
Egyptian, Algerian, Tunisian, and Palestinian terrorists will be 
trained in addition to some Asian and African nationals. 
  Dr. Usamah Bin-Ladin, who is wanted by the law in several 
Arab countries, is helping the Sudanese Government to finance 
these camps. Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir issued a decree 
-- which was published by the newspaper AL-INQADH on Wednesday, 
5 January -- granting 1,550 square meters of residential land to 
Bin-Ladin's al- Hijrah Company to build its headquarters on. 
  Al-Bashir's decree also transferred the ownership of "al- 
Mukabarat" agricultural project in the Northern region to 
Bin-Ladin. Agricultural produce from the project's 20,000 
feddans will used to supply the terrorist camps. These camps 
are being opened in the Northern Region in the wake of the 
amendment of the Sudanese Citizenship Law.

  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The opposition 
Sudanese Democratic Unionist Party yesterday announced its 
rejection of the self-determination proposal, saying that the 
problem of the south and any other regional problems can only be 
radically solved within a democratic framework and on an 
amicable basis. 
  In a statement issued from Cairo yesterday the party called 
for safeguarding Sudanese unity -- territory and people -- 
"toppling the [National Islamic] Front's regime," and holding a 
national constitutional conference based on the Sudanese peace 
agreement and the charter of the [opposition] National 
Democratic Grouping. 
  It also stressed that the self-determination question in 
Sudan has been settled since independence in 1956. 
  It pointed out that this issue has two aspects: a legal 
aspect and a political aspect. It listed the documents opposed 
to undermining national unity. It said: We are not listing the 
legal stipulations and evidence to prove that there are no 
regional problems in our country, but because political debates 
must be based on solid legal and realistic foundations, from 
which to proceed toward finding solutions to the new problems.

<F P=106> [By Randa Habib] </F>
  [Text] Amman, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Jordan has ordered more than 
20 Iranian diplomats to leave the country because of their links 
with Moslem fundamentalists, political sources said Thursday [3 
February]. 
  The foreign ministry revealed it had informed the Iranian 
authorities at the beginning of January that 21 of its 26 
diplomats here had two months to leave. 
  The official reason was that Jordan wanted to achieve more 
of 
a balance between the number of diplomats in each country, as 
Jordan has only two in Tehran, and there is no Iranian community 
here. 
  However, political sources said the government ordered out 
the Iranians because of their contacts with Islamic 
fundamentalists, who are suspected of carrying out two recent 
bomb attacks on sex cinemas which injured nine people. 
  The main fundamentalist party, the Islamic Action Front, 
condemned the first cinema blast, in Amman last month, but 
called for tighter legislation to implement a ban on sex films. 
  The sources said Jordan had proof that the embassy was 
financing the fundamentalists, and the authorities had accused 
the Iranian ambassador of having interfered in parliamentary 
elections in November. 
  Western diplomats told AFP the ambassador, Ahmad 
Dastmalchian, was formerly a member of the revolutionary guards 
and played a major role in setting up the pro-Iranian Hizballah 
guerrilla movement in Lebanon. He refused to make any comment. 
  Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the Middle East peace 
process suffered a setback in the elections, in which candidates 
close to King Husayn won 59 out of the 80 seats in the lower 
house of parliament, guaranteeing that any peace treaty with 
Israel would be ratified. 
  The fundamentalists kept only 18 of the 30 seats they held 
in 
the previous, non-party assembly elected in 1989. 
  Jordan and Iran resumed diplomatic relations in January 1991 
after a 10-year break. Tehran broke off ties because of Amman's 
support for Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988. 
  The Iranian embassy in Amman reopened in March 1991 and 
Jordan's embassy in Tehran soon after. 
  On Saturday the first secretary at the Jordanian embassy in 
Lebanon, Na'ib 'Umran Ma'ayitah, was shot dead in Beirut. 
  The killing came almost a week after King Husayn said in 
Washington that he hoped to meet Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin to boost chances of peace. 
  The Jordanian Ambassador in Beirut, Fakhri Abu-Talib, said 
the attack was "aimed at the (peace) process in which Jordan is

  [Excerpts] His Majesty King Husayn arrived in Vienna this 
evening on a short visit to Austria during which his majesty 
will hold talks with top Austrian officials on developments in 
the Middle East peace process, the situation in the Balkan 
region, and bilateral relations. 
  Before this, his majesty visited the Jordanian troops 
operating within the international peacekeeping forces in 
Croatia. [passage omitted] 
  At the end of the visit, His Majesty King Husayn, commander 
in chief of the Jordanian Armed Forces, spoke to a number of 
Jordanian newspaper correspondents. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified 
Correspondent] Your Majesty the King, if you will allow me, I 
have a question about the talks Your Majesty held in the United 
States on the peace process. Can you tell us about the outcome 
of these talks, and since Jordan is concerned about the issue of 
peace, do you think that there is progress on the [Jordanian] 
track? 
  [Husayn] The visit was very successful. Contacts at all U.S. 
official levels were good, starting with President Clinton, the 
U.S. Administration, and many of those I met with who are 
concerned about peace in the entire region. Naturally, we began 
talks on the various tracks at that time. Afterwards, we 
followed reports from Davos and the meeting that was held there. 
I believe that there has been progress achieved on certain 
issues and that our stand is clear toward them. We supported 
our kinfolk and brothers until they decided to talk on behalf of 
themselves and we will continue to support them to the best of 
our ability. 
  We are seeking a comprehensive, durable, and just peace that 
is acceptable to future generations. However, in terms of the 
Jordanian-Israeli track, we began discussing the items on the 
agenda. We were never convinced of the proposals that have been 
presented from time to time on signing a peace treaty first and 
then starting discussions all the requirements of peace. We are 
marching toward peace, but we have to tackle all important 
issues in a manner that satisfies God, our consciences, and our 
people. May God bless us in this endeavor. 
  [Correspondent] Sir, can you give us the honor of reporting 
to the Jordanian citizens about your health condition? 
  [Husayn] May God bless you. Thanks be to God. The results 
were very good. They did not find any traces of the illness. 
They only asked that I undergo a final medical checkup within 
six months and then routine annual checkups, nothing more or 
less. Everything is good, thanks be to God. [end recording]

  [Text] The Zionist enemy escalated its land, sea, and air 
aggression against Lebanon today. Enemy forces bombarded the 
western and central sectors of south Lebanon this morning. 
Israeli gunboats cruised off the Lebanese coast in south 
Lebanon and enemy helicopters strafed several areas. 
  At 1115 today a resistance group attacked Bra'shit and Bayt 
Yahun posts and reports say they scored direct hits on both 
posts. Zionist enemy forces bombarded Bra'shit, Tibnin, and 
Haddatha. More than 10 shells landed in Bra'shit. The 
townships of al-Mansuri, Majdal Zun, Buyut al-Sayyid, and Zibqin 
came under sporadic artillery barrage that continued until noon 
and caused heavy property damage. An Amal resistance group 
retaliated by attacking the Jisr al-Hamra' and claimed the 
destruction of a 12.7-mm machine-gun post. 
  According to later reports from Tyre, the Islamic Resistance 
attacked two enemy posts in al-Hamra' and Radar Hill this 
morning. During the attack, resistance men detonated explosive 
charges near enemy patrols in the two villages. Hostile 
helicopters strafed the towns of a-Mansuri and Buyut al-Sayyid 
along with hostile gunboats. Hostile warplanes flew several 
sorties over the south this morning.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel] </F>
  [Text] The talk about possible Israeli withdrawal from the 
security zone in the framework of the anticipated arrangement 
with Syria has generated great anxiety among members of the SLA 
[South Lebanese Army] upper echelons. 
  The remarks by U.S. elements in Washington to the effect 
that 
the arrangement with Syria will necessitate a phased Israeli 
withdrawal from the security zone to be carried out over several 
years have reached senior SLA officers and caused much concern. 
  In conversations with senior officers at the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] Northern Command, SLA Commander Antoine Lahd's 
aides voiced serious anxiety over the possibility of being 
deserted by Israel. An SLA officer has told IDF commanders: "We 
are afraid you will leave us, and we will become a target for 
the Lebanese and the Syrians." 
  Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, the Northern Command 
commander, and brigadier General Gabi Ashkenazi, chief of the 
Liaison Unit With Lebanon, apprised their interlocutors of the 
remarks of Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, 
who said during a tour of Qiryat Shemona three weeks ago that 
Israel will not desert its allies in south Lebanon. The SLA has 
been apprised of the basic conditions for any possible 
arrangement in south Lebanon and of the Israeli demand to 
guarantee the local residents' safety.

  [Excerpts] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, said she 
has put across the Pakistan case on Kashmir, the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and other international issues in Davos and 
Geneva very strongly. This enhanced the image of Pakistan in 
the international community. She was addressing a news 
conference in Islamabad this afternoon on her return after a 
week-long visit abroad. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister said she raised the Kashmir issue at the 
Human Rights Commission as she had promised to the people of 
Pakistan and Kashmir. It is Pakistan's basic policy to 
repeatedly shake the world conscience about the Indian 
repression in Kashmir. She told the world assembly that India's 
allegations about Pakistan's interference in occupied Kashmir 
are totally baseless and wrong because about 700 Indian soldiers 
are deployed at every one km distance along the line of control. 
India has, thus, raised an iron wall on the border. 
  When asked about threats coming from across the border, the 
prime minister said we are not afraid of them as Pakistan is 
capable of defending itself. She pointed out that these threats 
show that the Indian case on Kashmir is weak and it does not 
wants a political solution. She said the Jammu and Kashmir 
dispute is an international dispute and both India and Pakistan 
are committed to a plebiscite there. To a question, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto said while agreeing to talks with India, Pakistan sent a 
clear signal to India that Pakistan believes in talks and there 
is a government in Pakistan which can settle the Kashmir issue, 
but these talks will be successful only if the human rights 
situation in occupied Kashmir is improved. The prime minister 
said India failed to respond positively to repeated Pakistani 
proposals for ending atrocities in Kashmir. That is why we had 
to go to international forums. She said she told the Indian 
foreign secretary during his visit to Pakistan that India should 
take visible steps in the valley, including the release of 
Kashmiri leaders, reduction of the Indian forces, and stopping 
the killings. The prime minister said Pakistan even now is 
ready for talks with India on the Kashmir issue, but first India 
should end repression in Kashmir. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Shakil Sheikh] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad: MNA [Member of the National Assembly] 
Asif Ali Zardari will proceed to Banghdad on February 9 as prime 
minister's special envoy to make arrangements for the release of 
three Pakistanis who have been sentenced to jail in Iraq. 
  During his three-day visit, Zardari will be accompanied by 
Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan and Bashir Riaz, a former 
press spokesman of the prime minister. 
  According to informed sources, the special envoy will 
deliver 
a written message of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn for the release of two armed forces 
personnel, employed by the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and 
one civilian. 
  All of them had lost their way and strayed into the Iraqi 
territory during the Gulf war and the Iraqi authorities awarded 
six to eight years sentences to them. 
  Utilising this first hight-level Pak-Iraq contact since the 
Gulf war which resulted in total devastation of Iraq, Pakistan 
is sending 10 to 14 tons of life-saving drugs, worth Rs[rupees] 
2 million in a special C-180 flight as a special humanitarian 
gesture to the Iraqi people. The same plane will also carry the 
delegation. 
  High level official sources told 'The News' that the 
delegation would remain in Baghdad from February 9 to 11. 
During its stay the delegation will hold meetings with 
President Saddam Husayn and several other Iraqi government 
leaders in an apparent bid to remove unnecessary tritants in the 
Pak-Iraq relationships including the imprisonment of the three 
Pakistanis. 
  It is learnt that spadework for the Zardari-headed 
delegation 
has already been done. A C-130 aircraft is being loaded with 
life-saving drugs the list of which was said to have been 
provided by the Iraqi authorities. 
  Foreign Office sources say that the Zardari mission will 
prove a great success as it will secure release of the 
Pakistanis and would also help remove irritants between the two 
Muslim countries, besides reactivating traditional relations 
between Pakistan and Iraq. 
  Earlier, communicaitons exchanged between the two countries 
revealed that Iraqi leadership is pleased and deeply touched by 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's gesture in nominating her 
husband as special envoy. Pakistan's ambassador to Iraq had 
already held lengthy deliberations with Iraqi Foreign Secretary 
Abdul Jabbar Al-Douri. 
  The Iraqi response to a request from Pakistan for the 
release 
of its three nationals is reported to be 'highly encouraging' 
Iraqi government has also shown its eagerness to welcome the 
Pakistani special envoy on his arrival in Baghdad. Iraq also 
views it as 'welcome opportunity for dialogue' at a high level.

<F P=106> [By special reporter] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad -- According to responsible sources, it 
has been decided after high-level consultations to file a case 
in the U.S. court through Pakistan's American legal adviser if 
the F-16 fighter planes, P3C and N [as published] fighter 
planes, and other defense equipment manufactured [for Pakistan] 
and being stored in the United Sates are not supplied to 
Pakistan by April. Pakistan has so far paid the United States 
$1.01 billion for the defense equipment. If the equipment is 
not supplied by April, then Pakistan's American legal adviser 
will be directed to take this legitimate case to the court to 
seek a clarification as to why the equipment was not sent to 
Pakistan despite the fact that Pakistan already paid for them. 
  The sources said that the legal adviser whose services were 
sought by Pakistan in the United States has completed 
preparation of documents on the U.S. failure to supply the 
defense equipment on schedule despite Pakistan fulfilling all 
the obligations under the deal. The U.S. legal expert has 
informed the Government of Pakistan that despite the existence 
of the Pressler Amendment, Pakistan's case in relation to the 
defense items is very strong. If this case is filed at a U.S. 
court, then it can easily be proven that agreements -- 
liabilities of which Pakistan had been fulfilling even after the 
implementation of the Pressler Amendment in October 1990 -- are 
not covered by the amendment. 
  The sources said that when the opinion of the U.S. legal 
adviser was ignored by the United States and the proposal for an 
intergovernmental group to sort out the relevant legal issues 
was rejected, Pakistani policymakers then decided to wait until 
April to allow fulfillment of the U.S. promise of taking 
political steps to do away with the discriminatory nature of the 
Pressler Amendment. The sources said that Pakistan paid a total 
of $1.01 billion to the United States for these defense items. 
The funds were not taken as a loan, but were paid to the United 
States in installments from the Pakistani exchequer. 
  According to the deal, Pakistan should have received 12 F-16 
planes for its Air Force, three P3C planes for its Navy, and 
other defense equipment produced for Pakistan by now. The 
United States, however, is consistently saying that the U.S. 
military aid to Pakistan has been suspended under the Pressler 
Amendment and that the equipment will be supplied to Pakistan 
after the Pressler Amendment issue is resolved. The sources 
said that Pakistan has informed the United States at the 
diplomatic level that it is being questioned by Pakistani public 
opinion as to why the defense equipment cannot be obtained from 
the United States even after Pakistan paid $1.01 billion for 
them.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "F-16 Planes Will Be Available Soon"] </F>
  [Text] Federal Defense Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani has 
said that our relations with the United States are improving. 
The supply of F-16 planes and other equipment, which were 
withheld due to the Pressler Amendment, will begin soon. 
Pakistan has already paid the United States $1 billion for the 
F-16 planes. Pakistan is also trying to acquire arms from 
France and the PRC to fortify its defense. The possibility of 
acquiring F-16 planes and other equipment from the United States 
is viewed as an indication of improving relations between the 
two countries. Pakistan also can purchase the equipment 
necessary for its defense from the open market. However, if 
they can be obtained from the United States or any other 
friendly country, then their uninterrupted supply can be 
assured. Pakistan is not oblivious of its defense requirements 
even for a moment and is meeting its defense needs on a priority 
basis.

<F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in Misratah on 3 </F>
February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Brothers, this is Misratah, the town whose 
history is known to all Libyans and to all enemies, and whose 
heroic battles during the war of Jihad and liberation are well 
known to everyone. [passage omitted] 
  We say to the U.S., Britain, France, the hirelings, and 
Zionists, that Misratah will reject treason and arrogance. The 
enemy's calculations, which have led it to issue three unjust 
resolutions -- concocted through the Security Council -- against 
the Libyan people must be foiled here in Misratah. We should 
announce from here, from this town in which we challenged the 
fleets of Italy and its unjust aggression at a time when there 
was no comparison between the defenses of the inhabitants of 
Misratah and the Italian brute force. Today, however, there is 
some comparison between our force and its readiness and of that 
of the enemy's, who might like to repeat the aggression once 
more. 
  Brothers, we would like to announce from Misratah that the 
Libyan people has come to the conclusion that the battle is not 
against the Jamahiriyah; it was not caused by the Pan Am 
incident and it is not a battle between just two sides. The 
Libyan people has come to the conclusion that a fresh 
colonialist campaign and a new imperialist scheme is under way 
against the Arab nation. However, it has been ordained that 
Libya should raise aloft the banner of this battle. And it has 
been ordained that the Libyan people should raise aloft the 
banner of Saladin, Jamal-'Abd-al-Nasir, al-Suwahli, and Umar 
al-Mukhtar, as well as other banners which symbolize our 
glorious history; we should raise them all aloft. 
  The Libyan people is aware that Washington, Paris, Berlin, 
Bonn, London, and Tel Aviv are all behind the battle which is 
taking place now in the streets of Cairo. The battle which is 
taking place in the streets of Cairo is a long and a serious 
battle; it is a battle which has nothing to do with Islamic 
extremism and has nothing to do whatsoever with Islam. It is a 
scheme to divide Egypt into a mini-state for Copts and another 
one for Muslims, and to Balkanize the Arab homeland. 
  The Egyptian people must therefore be aware that Tel Aviv, 
Washington, Paris, and London -- and Bonn too -- are all behind 
the battle which is taking place in the streets of Cairo at this 
moment. It is the beginning of a serious battle, a very serious 
battle indeed, which aims at fragmenting Egypt and dividing it 
into mini-states, because Egypt is the mother of pan-Arabism. 
Cairo is the capital of the Arab nation, and the Egyptian 
people has made innumerable sacrifices against the Crusaders, 
colonialists, and Zionists. 
  The Libyan people would like to warn its fraternal Egyptian 
people against the seriousness of the plot which is being 
hatched by Western power and Tel Aviv. The faked peace process, 
which is being bragged about to us these days, is no more that a 
smokescreen for the Zionist conspiracy against Cairo and the 
U.S. conspiracy against Cairo. Hence, the Libyan people in 
Misratah would like to warn its brothers, with whom it is linked 
by same fate, its Egyptian brothers and Cairo, the capital of 
the Arab nation, that a serious conspiracy is being hatched 
against Cairo, first and foremost before Tripoli and Misratah. 
  The Egyptian people ought to vigilant. We would like to warn 
our brothers in the fraternal Egyptian leadership, out of our 
concern for them and for our common fate, to warn them from 
Misratah, the town of Jihad and resistance and the town of 
heroic sacrifices, that the peace process is a lie and a 
smokescreen for the dangerous conspiracy against Cairo itself. 
  Therefore, those meetings, delegations, consultations, and 
compromises are merely a dangerous conspiracy which hides the 
serious, the secret, wanton, and dangerous work which is being 
carried out day in, day out, against Egypt itself, against 
Palestine, and against the Arab nation. We are going to take 
Tel Aviv's wraps off here in Misratah: When it sends 
delegations to Cairo, Taba, Oslo, Geneva, and to the United 
Nations, it is in order to hide the serious conspiracy against 
Egypt, a conspiracy which is being hatched in secret in order to 
Balkanize Egypt and to divide Egypt in a bid to destroy the 
biggest Arab country, and to undermine Arab stamina for a 
confrontation. 
  They look at peace between Egypt and the Zionist enemy from 
their viewpoint as being a temporary truce, and when 
preparations are completed there will be a clash, because the 
Jews will not be satisfied with a small state surrounded by 
Arabs and confined between Arabs and the sea, and get a tiny 
state. The Jews are planning to establish an empire, not 
between the Euphrates and the Nile, but from the Atlantic to the 
Gulf, which would replace the Arab nation. 
  At the same time, O brothers, I thank you for giving us 
this opportunity to deliver this serious speech which concerns 
the fate of the Arab nation. At the same time, O brothers, 
while maneuvering and deceptive operations are openly taking 
place, such as negotiations on Gaza and Jericho, these moves 
hide the real criminal plan directed against Egypt. At the same 
time, O brothers, they send delegations and talk with Algeria, 
which is the second biggest Arab state and is the country with 
1.5 million martyrs. They court Algeria with lies and talk about 
economic aid -- the IMF, the World Bank -- and the possibility 
of granting loans to Algeria. At the same time, O brothers, they 
are igniting covert fires and working to cause an internal 
explosion within Algeria. Paris is behind the battle which has 
started in Algeria, and France fans it directly with the black 
French hand. It is not an Islamic battle at all, it is a 
battle, which according to their plans, will not end until 
Algeria is fragmented piece by piece, and tiny states are set up 
in Algeria once again. Then these states will be ethnic and 
family states which are isolated from each other, and which ask 
Europe for help and which are at Europe's mercy. 
  From Misratah, the city of historical resistance, the city 
of 
struggle, bravery, and sacrifices, we address the call to the 
brave Algerian people and our friends in the new Algerian 
leadership, to warn them against this conspiracy being hatched 
by Paris, the Western states, and Zionism, in order to bring 
about the fragmentation of and balkanization of Algeria, and to 
realize that the battle is not with the Islamists or with Islam. 
Algeria is an Islamic state, Egypt is also an Islamic Sunni 
state. There is no defection from Islam or heresy in Egypt. 
Egypt is a country of Islam and is a country of the Holy 
al-Azhar, but the things which are taking place in the streets 
of Egypt and Algeria are an U.S.-French-British-German-Jewish 
conspiracy. 
  The Libyan people are those who can today raise their voice 
high in order to warn the Arab nation against this sudden 
danger, O brothers, against the Arab nation. The reason for 
this is because the circumstances of the Arab peoples do not 
allow them to express what is in their hearts with regard to 
America, Britain, France, and Zionism. The Arab peoples are 
prisoners, and the Arab petty states are tantamount to mass 
prisons for the peoples of the Arab nation. 
  The Libyan people have broken the chains and have liberated 
themselves with the revolution, the great al-Fatih revolution, 
and their voice has become loud. The Libyan people are their 
own masters and are the people of the People's Congresses and 
People's Committees, the people of revolutionary committees and 
free vocational trade unions, the people who possess authority, 
wealth, and weapons. 
  O brothers, we have the right to warn our nation from 
Misratah. We have chosen Misratah because Egypt knows Misratah, 
Algeria knows Misratah, and the Arab nation and the enemy know 
Misratah. The enemy knows the bitter lessons it tasted in 
Misratah. The enemy recalls the distress it faced from 
Misratah's resistance. [passage omitted] 
  The battle is one from the Ocean to the Gulf, regardless of 
attempts to deceive us. We understand history. We make 
history. We will not be deceived, O brothers. The battle is one 
from the ocean to the Gulf and the enemy is one from Tel Aviv to 
Washington. One enemy against one nation. 
  We should not be deceived, O brothers, that there is an 
Algerian issue, a Palestinian issue, a Syrian issue, an Iraqi 
issue, and a Libyan issue. This is a lie. This is deception. 
This cannot fool us while we are talking from Misratah. 
[passage omitted] However, the U.S. of yesterday is not the 
U.S. of today. The U.S. today supports with all its might the 
artificial Jewish state and arms it with the nuclear weapon and 
with the bacteriological and chemical weapons, which are 
targeted toward the oblivious Arabs. O simple-minded Arabs, 
Israel's weapons are targeted on you alone. 
  Who has a quarell with the Jewish state? You Arabs and 
Muslims. And who supplied this mini-state with the mass 
destruction weapons? It is the West who is deceiving you at 
present and who laugh and ridicule you, and tells you it is your 
friend. What sort of friendship is it between the Arab nation 
and its real traditional enemies? The animosity between Islam 
and the Jews and the Christians will continue until the day of 
judgment. This is the will of God and all other attempts are 
naive and ignorant. 
  We are not seeking friendship with the imperialist states. 
However, what we want is that they remain within their borders 
and we remain within ours. That is all. We have no ambitions 
with regard to their assistance. We are not in need of 
assistance. We are not in need of assistance either from the 
U.S., from Britain, from France, or from the European Economic 
Community [EEC]. To hell with the EEC. We can do without the 
EEC and without any relations with the EEC. Those who pin their 
hopes on the EEC and on European assistance are plowing in the 
sea. They are naive. They are ignorant. They are 
insignificant, and history will cast them to its wastebin. 
  The Libyan people, O brothers, has the honor and the pride 
and glory that it is paying the price for independence. We are 
a free and independent people. We have glory and pride in that. 
We challenge any of the peoples around us to be free. All the 
peoples around us are shackled. If they were not shackled 
internally they would be shackled by foreign aid and burdened by 
foreign debts, and are under foreign control and under foreign 
aid. What sort of independence is it that depends on foreign 
aid? What independence is it that depends on foreign 
assistance? What sort of independence is it for Kuwait if it is 
unable to remain independent without the protection of foreign 
forces? Joining Iraq would be a million times better for it 
than to remain artificially independent and dependent on the 
presence of foreign forces. What would happen if the foreign 
forces withdrew? Kuwait's independence would disappear along 
with the foreign forces. 
  If Saudi Arabia's independence is dependent on the U.S. 
forces, what meaning does this independence have? For Saudi 
Arabia to join Egypt or Iraq or Yemen would be better than to 
have an independence that depends on the presence of foreign 
forces. 
  The Libyan people, O brothers, is paying the price for 
genuine independence. This the price of independence. It is to 
give up the foreigner, be hostile to those hostile to you, and 
to reject bargaining. Bargaining with dignity, bargaining with 
your brother. We, O brothers, do not bargain on Iraq and on the 
sufferings of the people of Iraq and the tragedies of the 
children of Iraq. Those who do that are cowards. They are the 
insignificant and the lowly who will be cursed by the nation and 
cursed by the children of Iraq. 
  We, O brothers, do not sacrifice the fate of the nation or 
the future of the nation, or the future of the Palestinian 
people, or the Palestinian issue for the sake of our national 
issue. We know that our national issue is part of the pan-Arab 
issue, and that any loss in the Palestinian issue is a loss to 
the Libyan national issue. 
  Therefore, we profoundly regret the sale of dear Palestine. 
Palestine has been sold and holy Jerusalem has been abandoned. 
The bargaining on the Palestinian people has been done. O 
brothers, they are selling the Palestinians at auction. They 
are trading Jerusalem; let the curse befall those rulers who are 
trading holy Jerusalem. They are trading the al-Aqsa Mosque, O 
brothers. They are trading Palestine. Selling the Palestinian 
people, selling, O brothers, the future of the Arab nation, 
selling the future of your children and grandchildren. This is 
the price of independence, O brothers, which Libya is currently 
paying. 
  Libya is not paying the Lockerbie price, because no verdict 
has been passed regarding this issue to the effect that Libya 
should pay this price. However, Libya, with resolutions 731, 
748 and (?889), is paying the price of independence, the price 
of liberation, the price of emancipation, the price of it being 
a free and sovereign country which can say no when it wants and 
yes when it wants, and according to what it thinks. Those who 
do not pay this price are neither independent nor free. He who 
wants to have freedom will have to pay the price. 
  Therefore, we declare that we have nothing to do with 
Lockerbie, and that we have no interest in this issue. We do 
not look at it and we are closing this file, because we know 
that we are not going to pay the price of Lockerbie. But we are 
paying the price for our irreversible independence. Liberation 
and emancipation are irreversible, independence is irreversible. 
We will not retreat from the fact that we are living free under 
the sun and on the land of our forefathers. [cheers] [passage 
omitted] We have to declare, O brothers, that Egypt is in 
danger, Algeria is in danger, Yemen is in danger, and Sudan is 
in danger. We have to declare, O brothers, that these peoples 
are exposed to danger before the Libyan people, because the 
Libyan people is capable of confrontation and fighting, but 
these peoples have been deceived by peace, by the mirage of 
peace. The Arab nation is being deceived right now and a 
conspiracy is being fomented against it, the conspiracy of the 
Balkanization of the Arab nation and the tearing off of its 
limbs, O brothers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Hague, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Libya maintained a 
stubborn silence Thursday [3 February] night after the 
International Court of Justice rejected its long-standing claim 
to a strip of uranium-rich desert territory in northern Chad. 
  The court ruled Chad was the rightful owner of the Aouzou 
strip, ending a 22 year argument over ownership of the 114,000 
square kilometer (45,600 square mile) border territory. 
  Judges ruled 16 to one, the one being the Libyan judge, in 
favour of Chad's claim to the desert strip, inhabited by 
semi-nomadic herdsmen and farmers. 
  "It is a victory," said Chad's representative at the court, 
Abderahman Dadi. The sooner Libya keeps its word to abide by 
the court decision and end its occupation of the area, the 
better, Dadi added. 
  Neither the Libyan authorities nor the Libyan media made any 
mention of the ruling. 
  Libya annexed Aouzou, the only town within the 1,000 
kilometer (620 mile) long strip, in 1972, citing an unratified 
1935 treaty between Italy, Libya's former colonial master, and 
France. 
  Court judges said the 1955 border established by a 
"friendship and good neighbour" agreement between France, Chad's 
former colonial power, and Libya, should stand. 
  The Libyan representative at the court left without making 
any comment. 
  The two sides opted to take the dispute before the UN's 
highest court in August 1990. Libya like Chad agreed to abide 
by the court's decision.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 3 (AFP)--Three of the seven Islamic 
militants killed in a police raid in Cairo were involved in the 
murder of a British tourist in October 1992, police said 
Thursday. 
  Police said the three shot dead on Wednesday -- Yasir Zaki, 
'Abd-al-Nabi Tayih and Tariq al-Qurayshi -- took part in the 
murder of 28-year-old Sharon Hill in the town of Dayrut, 300 
kilometers (180 miles) south of Cairo. 
  Two other British tourists were wounded in the attack. Hill 
was the first foreigner to be killed in a campaign of violence 
launched by fundamentalist militants in March 1992. 
  Western embassies in Cairo said Thursday they were taking 
seriously the threats against foreigners issued by the outlawed 
Islamic militant group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah following the 
police raid. 
  However, the embassies stressed they were not warning their 
nationals against visiting Egypt. 
  On Wednesday, the militant group warned foreign investors 
and 
tourists to leave the country, saying it would retaliate against 
the "massacre" of seven of its members by police, and its next 
attacks would be "extremely tough." 
  The interior ministry said police shot dead the seven 
militants when they came under fire in a raid on an apartment in 
a poor district of Cairo. 
  They discovered a large quantity of arms, explosives and 
remote control devices in the apartment. None of the policemen 
was hurt. 
  Seven foreigners were among the 293 people killed since the 
militants launched their campaign aimed at toppling the secular 
government of President Husni Mubarak. 
  Two were killed in an attack on a coffee shop in Cairo in 
February 1993. Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack, 
which remained unresolved. 
  Four other foreigners were killed when a gunman opened fire 
last October in the Semiramis Hotel in Cairo. Police said the 
gunman, arrested on the spot, was mentally ill. 
  Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi warned Wednesday that the 
security forces would continue the crackdown against Islamic 
militants "until the last terrorist is eliminated."

<F P=106> [Report by Lamia Radi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Cairo, Feb 3 (AFP)--Western embassies urged 
their citizens to be on the alert on Thursday after Islamic 
militants warned foreign tourists and investors to stay out of 
Egypt. 
  Security forces said meanwhile that three of the seven 
militants killed in a police raid here on Wednesday -- sparking 
the threat against foreigners -- had taken part in the murder of 
a British tourist in October 1992. 
  Embassies said the threat issued by the underground 
al-Jama'a 
al-Islamiyah was being taken seriously. But they did not warn 
their nationals against visiting Egypt, where the economy relies 
on tourism. 
  British embassy spokesman Martin Day said the mission was in 
contact with the Egyptian authorities, although he noted it was 
not the first time that foreigners were being threatened. 
  "Obviously we're taking this call seriously," he said. 
  The US mission said it issued a statement to notify 
Americans 
living in Cairo of the threat. It was a strictly precautionary 
move in response to concern from the American community, the 
embassy said. 
  A French spokesman said there was no cause for alarm, while 
the foreign ministry in Paris said its citizens should stay on 
the alert in Egypt. [passage omitted covered in previously 
filed material] 
  On Thursday, there was no immediate sign of panic 
cancellations but hotels said that bookings were already low, 
despite it being the high season for tourism to Egypt. 
  "At the moment, 90 percent of our clients are Arabs from the 
Gulf. They don't feel concerned by the threats of the Moslem 
fundamentalists," said a hotel manager, asking not to be named. 
  In January, Tourism Minister Mamduh al-Biltaji said revenue 
from tourism slumped by 42 percent last year, compared to 1992. 
  In financial circles, there was also no immediate response 
to 
the latest threat. "It's not going to lead to the liquidation of 
foreign holdings in Egypt, that's for sure," said an official in 
an Egyptian-Western bank.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi 
has stated that the recent confrontation with terrorists in the 
al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' area was the result of careful planning and 
reflected the high standard of physical and mental training of 
the members of the police force. It also reflects the high 
standard they achieved in intensive training to deal with such 
crimes in Egyptian society. 
  In statements to newsmen today, the interior minister said 
the security services have much information about the financing 
and recruitment efforts of the terrorists and some misled 
individuals who harm and betray their religion and homeland in 
return for a small sum of money. 
  Answering a question about a REUTER report that some 
terrorists issued a statement threatening to carry out terrorist 
operations, al-Alfi said the Interior Ministry rejects what 
could be called a statement by the terrorist groups, because 
terrorism has no voice, opinion, or aim in Egypt. The ministry 
does not permit criminals to address the Egyptian public as if 
they impose the rule of crime on the millions of honorable 
people in Egypt. 
  The interior minister added: The security services now have 
the initiative and the ability to strike at the terrorists' 
criminal rackets. They will not hesitate to confront and deter 
those who think they can impose their distorted views by force. 
  The minister explained that the police now fully believe 
that 
it is their responsibility to purge the country of the last 
terrorist, irrespective of the sacrifice. 
  Al-Alfi said that any criminal who thinks for one moment 
that 
he can threaten any Egyptian must realize that the security 
services can reach him and punish him for his crimes. It has 
become clear to the public at home and abroad that ugly 
terrorism represents a shallow ideology for people who have 
deviated from the teachings of their religion and their loyalty 
to their country. 
  Al-Alfi added that the Interior Ministry announces that it 
will take any terrorist who wants to repent before the honest 
Egyptian courts and that the door will remain open to all those 
who wish to repent and return to the right path to serve the 
interests of their country and people. The ministry can protect 
and assist him provided his repentance is sincere. 
  Al-Alfi said that the Interior Ministry emphasizes that the 
blood of the police and civilian martyrs will not be wasted and 
that any criminal will be punished quickly for any crime he has 
committed. 
  He added that the ministry also thinks that popular support 
for the police has become a strong front for achieving security 
and stability and for promoting development in Egypt. 
  The interior minister affirmed that the security service's 
success in containing terrorism is not the only success they 
seek but a first step to be followed by others, supported by all 
the national forces to impose complete security control. 
  He explained that the ministry's standing instructions to 
the 
police are to confront [words indistinct] shooting with force. 
Al-Alfi said that the Interior Ministry will not be lenient with 
any policeman who fails to use his personal weapon when 
necessary, because the confrontation has become total on the way 
to ending terrorism throughout Egypt.

  [Text] In a statement to the national daily EL WATAN to be 
published on 5 February, Youcef Khatib, the chairman of the 
National Dialogue Commission [NDC], revealed that the method of 
appointing the head of state was the subject of a recommendation 
made in a constitutional council memorandum to the Higher State 
Council and the NDC. 
  The NDC chairman said that the national consensus conference 
has achieved its main objective of establishing the tradition of 
dialogue among Algerians. Khatib added that history will record 
the fundamental role played by the civil society, describing it 
as the third force. 
  In reply to a question on the obscurity that surrounded the 
identity and credibility of the dissolved Islamic Salvation 
Front's figures, whom the NDC had contacted, Khatib sufficed by 
saying it was a representation, without offering further 
explanation.

  [Text] Algiers, Feb 3 (AFP)--Algeria's security forces 
widened a ban on possessing rifles to the whole country Thursday 
after the fifth political assassination in six days. 
  The widening of the ban from 10 departments in central 
Algeria to the whole country follows the killing Wednesday of 
two political activists. 
  Yahia Bouguettaya, the former mayor of Mohammadia, 
south-east 
Algeria, and Mohamed Touali, an activist in Algeria's Ettahadi 
(Challenge) political party, were assassinated Wednesday. 
  Touali, 32, was kidnapped overnight Tuesday in Constantine, 
east Algeria, and his body later discovered, the party said. 
  Their deaths bring the number of political assassinations to 
six since former communist party official Ferhat Chibout was 
killed on January 27. 
  The latest deaths follow the killing Tuesday in the Casbah 
district of Algiers of French journalist Olivier Quemeneur and 
the wounding by gunmen of the cameraman's Australian colleague, 
Scott Allan White. 
  Armed Islamic groups have waged a war on the regime, 
targeting foreigners politicians, and intellectuals as part of 
their campaign, since the cancellation in January 1992 of a 
general election which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was 
poised to win. 
  The FIS, now outlawed, has blamed alleged government death 
squads for carrying out some of the killings.

  [Text] Condemnation of assassination and violence in all 
its forms, be it against Algerians or foreigners, the list will 
not end as long as more names continue to fall. Here is more 
with Nassira Ait Saleh: 
  [Ait Saleh] The list of victims is growing longer. The 
bloodletting of the best Algerians continue; even foreigners 
have not been spared. 
  The wantonness of terrorism cannot be explained, save by the 
logic of blind madness, which aims at destabilizing the country 
and desecrating the right to live. 
  Terrorism does not exclude anyone; intellectuals, 
journalists, civilians, policemen, gendarmes, and soldiers have 
all been a target for the bullets of terrorism, merely because 
they are one of Algeria's symbols. 
  Two days ago, two foreign journalists were also the victims 
of terrorism. One was killed instantly and the other was 
seriously wounded. This took place at the Casbah of Algiers -- 
at what should be a symbolic and welcoming quarter, an 
international historical monument. 
  This hemorrhage must stop. Algeria will remain steadfast, 
thanks to its sons, who are producing, resisting, and also 
dying.

  [Text] Jeddah, 3 Feb (SPA) -- Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid, 
secretary-general of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO], 
expressed the organization's great concern over the escalation 
of (?aggressive) campaigns waged by Serbs and Croats against 
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In a statement issued today, the secretary-general condemned 
attempts by Serbia and Croatia to wipe out the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from the map by intensifying attacks, 
increasing direct military intervention, declaring general 
mobilization, and other means. 
  He said that despite the clear and candid resolutions of the 
UN General Assembly and many resolutions of the UN Security 
Council, the prevarication of some of the main forces has 
prevented the UN from implementing its resolutions or 
endeavoring to impose them. He pointed out the dangers in 
securing a resolution based on the assumption of a possibility 
of restoring peace by imposing arbitrary and unjust conditions 
on the victims of the conflict. 
  The ICO secretary-general reaffirmed the ICO's full 
solidarity and support for the government and people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He urged the international community, 
particularly the UN Security Council's permanent members, to 
take effective action to stop further escalation of violence. 
He also called for the adoption of a principled method on the 
issue by all the sides concerned, including the European Union, 
so that a just peace may be restored in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Today's formidable Friday prayers, on the fourth day 
of the auspicious Ten Days of Dawn -- the day of prayer, jihad, 
promotion of virtue and prohibition of vice -- was held in 
Friday prayer venues throughout the state with the participation 
of masses of worshippers and in full glory. In today's Tehran 
Friday prayer sermons President Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani gave an analysis of the trend of the 
revolution as a crucial historical happening. He said: The 
causes and instruments of that most important happening -- which 
requires a most scholarly analysis from various global, 
regional, Islamic, ideological, and political dimensions -- must 
be looked for in three important factors: the vigilance and 
awareness of the people and their presence in the arena, the 
role of the leadership and guidance, and the creation of trust 
between the people and their leaders. 
  Tehran's ad hoc Friday imam considered the people's 
vigilance 
and awareness to be the most powerful factor in the victory of 
the Islamic revolution. He said: The vigilance and presence of 
the people in the arena are not only factors in the victory of 
the revolution but also its safeguard in the face of all events, 
such as the war and the conspiracies, and give continuation to 
the revolution during the period of construction, planning, and 
implementation of important and infrastructural tasks. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani described 
the 
human forming ideology of Islam as the most important factor in 
the awareness of the people, and he referred to the role of the 
pioneer clerics and religious scholars -- especially the most 
crucial role played by His Eminence Imam Khomeyni, the departed 
imam, may God Almighty be satisfied with him -- in making people 
aware during the 20 years of struggle before the revolution and 
the human forming role of that worthy source of emulation. He 
said: If a leader -- or a party -- with an objective wishes to 
succeed he must nurture vigilant and knowledgeable people. And 
in Iran, under the auspices of the wise leadership of the imam, 
may his soul be sanctified, such a thing came to pass. 
  The president called the existence of trust between the 
people and their leaders as the basis of movement and progress 
and as the instrument of eliminating problems and struggle 
against sabotage. He considered it as one of the most important 
factors of concern for the enemies. In this regard he said: The 
enemies of the revolution, who had discovered this secret of 
success, embarked on an extensive effort, from the first days of 
the Islamic revolution, to create a rift between the people and 
the leadership and the authorities. The imperialist propaganda 
in this regard never ceased and their satanic move still 
continues. But what has broken the back of the enemy is the 
existence of the popular sentiment and the wholesale and 
constant presence of the arena. 
  Referring to the assassination attempt on his life and the 
aims of the enemies of the revolution, the president said: 
  [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] This incident to which 
your attention has now been drawn -- the assassination attempt 
-- to my mind this is a very minor issue which can always 
happen. A few people can always give rise to a small incident. 
However, these things are no longer of any importance to the 
revolution. You should feel quite reassured about that. The 
revolution has now become quite separated from individuals. I 
said that the revolution has reached the stage of maturity; it 
is no longer a child which needs suckling. It provides its own 
sustenance. A lofty figure like the imam of the ummah departed 
from among these people. At that time we shuddered to think 
about what would happen when the imam would no longer be among 
us. Then we witnessed this calm movement of an ocean of people, 
and this Islamic revolution continues forever on its path. 
Through divine guidance, this ship correctly continues its 
voyage toward its destination in this tumultuous ocean. 
  How effective can individuals be any longer in this 
revolution that others should put themselves in trouble, should 
put themselves in danger so that a certain individial may or may 
not be there; and that a person like me who is one of the most 
minor soldiers of this revolution! 
  I say that world arrogance, America, and others should 
really 
know that in Iran they should give up the hope that by the 
physical or psychological elimination of individuals they can 
overcome the revolution. 
  May God protect you, your revolution and the leader of the 
revolution. We are very weak soldiers. There are many people 
like me who can be in the service of the people. [end recording] 
  Describing the assassination attempt on his life, Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: The plotters thought that by carrying 
out such a plot on the first day of the ceremonies marking the 
Ten Days of Dawn at a gathering which was attended by all 
foreign guests and reporters, they could disrupt the ceremonies 
marking the anniversary of the revolution, through a move which 
was minor in itself but which would have caused a great deal of 
publicity. By doing that, they wished to show to the world that 
the Islamic revolution has lost its luster [kamrang shodeh ast] 
in Iran. But, fortunately, they did not achieve any of their 
goals. 
  The president sincerely thanked the people for all their 
good 
wishes and sentiments in expressing their anxiety about the 
assassination attempt on his life. Thanking all the political 
and religious figures, various strata of the people and 
departments and organizations, the president asked that all the 
messages in this connection should come to an end. 
  Continuing his remarks, Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the 
inauguration of a number of very important projects during the 
Ten Days of Dawn, noting the inauguration of the Arak 
petrochemical complex and thousands of urban and rural projects. 
He said: The people are very well aware of the realities and 
enemy propaganda which says that the revolution has lost its 
glamor has no effect on them. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed: After the passing of 15 years, 
the Islamic revolution is now, more than ever, blooming and very 
well supported and we see its roots solid, its sacred offshoots 
healthy and the people most aware and in line with the 
revolution. The conspiracies hatched traditionally by the 
enemies aimed at the destruction of the revolution no longer 
have any effect. The 22 Bahman [11 February] marches will be a 
strong response to those who design such plots to weaken the 
revolution and the presence of the people on the scenes. 
  The president stressed: The people today find that what they 
staged the revolution for remains as strong as ever. Magnifying 
the problems and belittling the services, a ploy always used by 
arrogance, no longer undermines their resolve. 
  In the second sermon, the president referred to the fourth 
day of the Ten Days of Dawn, the day of prayers, jihad, and 
propagation of virtue and prohibition of vice. He described the 
role of such issues in the continuation of the Islamic 
revolution as fundamental.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Israeli 
soldiers disguised as Arabs shot dead a leader of the armed wing 
of the PLO's main group Fatah on Thursday [3 February] in the 
occupied Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said. 
  The troops, including women soldiers, opened fire from two 
cars at a group of Fatah Hawks sitting on the road in the Rafah 
refugee camp. Salim Mu'affi, the Hawks leader for the camp, was 
killed and another Palestinian wounded. 
  The Hawks fired back, wounding two members of the army's 
undercover unit, the sources said. The army sent in 
reinforcements and imposed a curfew as explosions were heard in 
the camp. 
  The armed wing of Fatah agreed to a ceasefire after the 
Israeli-PLO autonomy accord was signed on September 13. 
  But dissidents took up arms again after the army shot dead a 
leading Hawk, Ahmad Abu-Rish, in November shortly after he had 
been pardoned. The dissidents said earlier this week they had 
mounted seven anti-Israeli operations. 
  Muwafi was the 1,173rd Palestinian killed by Israeli gunfire 
in the six years of the intifada against Israel's rule of Gaza 
and the West Bank, according to an AFP toll.

<F P=106> [Report on address by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to a </F>
bankers' forum in Tel Aviv and an interview with political 
correspondent Shlomo Raz in Tel Aviv on 4 February] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Over the past several days, 
the prime minister has been saying that there is no hurry. 
Speaking today before a bankers' forum in Tel Aviv, he said 
that time is not of the essence, reiterating the famous phrase: 
There are no sacred dates. Israel is committed to the political 
process, hence, the date is less important. Last week he also 
introduced another element that has to be concluded before the 
agreement is signed -- the economic talks to be held in Paris. 
There is a wide range of issues still to be discussed, which 
will take a long time. Thus, there is no reason to assume that 
the negotiations or the implementation will end by 13 April. 
  The prime minister told leading Israeli bankers today that 
anything that is not finalized might turn into a detonator for 
future mishaps. This is an agreement between two entities 
which, to say the least, do not love each other and are 
constantly in friction. Therefore, the current agreement on 
Gaza and Jericho, as well as the agreement on the autonomy, 
serve as a test case for the possibility of making progress 
toward the permanent agreement. For that test case to succeed, 
the appropriate conditions must be prepared and 
misunderstandings should be avoided. 
  I would like to call attention to another remark by the 
prime 
minister regarding the events in the former USSR. National 
forums are thinking about this and holding consultations on this 
matter. Israel is definitely following and is worried by the 
events in the CIS. After his meeting with the bankers, Rabin 
spoke to the media. We will begin with the negotiations in Cairo 
next week and the routine consultations that are currently being 
held. 
  [Begin recording] [Rabin] I will not go into detail here. 
When Peres meets 'Arafat in Cairo on 7 February, the goal will 
be to wrap up the issues on which great progress was made in 
Davos. I speak of wordings that must ensure clarity on the 
issues of security -- including the border crossings and the 
size of the Jericho area -- in order to really attain 
agreed-upon, clear, and understood results. After this, we will 
also have to advance on economic and administrative issues, and 
arrange the Palestinian administration. Also, we have not yet 
held an in-depth discussion on the structure and size of the 
Palestinian police. Many issues are still pending. At the same 
time, as far as the security issues are concerned, the heart of 
the matter was dealt with in Davos, and I hope it will be 
completed in Cairo. 
  [Raz] Are there differences in nuances between the Foreign 
Ministry and the defense establishment? 
  [Rabin] Come off it. In the discussions there are different 
officials from the Foreign Ministry and the defense 
establishment. They have different views. In general, we are 
speaking of matters that are not of prime importance, rather 
about the a practical implementation of the issues in the 
everyday life. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] On the third day of the sacred 10 Days of Dawn 
celebrations, during which praise is given to martyrs, disabled, 
men missing in action, and prisoners of war, thousands of 
military commanders and model units of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran Army ground forces this afternoon participated in a 
glorious ceremony at the holy shrine of the founder of the 
Islamic revolution, where they renewed their alliance with the 
lofty ideas of His Excellency imam Khomeyni, may he be admitted 
to God's paradise, and also emphasised the need to execute the 
orders of Commander in Chief Ayatollah Khamene'i. 
  Hojjat ol-eslam val-moslemin Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni spoke at 
the meeting, which was held to praise the martyrs of the Islamic 
revolution, and also for thanksgiving prayers for the passing of 
the assassination danger against our country's president. Those 
attending also thanked the commanders and personnel of the Army 
for their services in guarding the boundaries of the Islamic 
motherland and the school of Koran. 
  Referring to the assassination attempt against the 
president, 
Khomeyni said: The Islamic revolution does not depend on an 
individual, and assassination or terror among the people will 
fail to deviate the revolution from its principle path.

<F P=106> [Safa Ha'iri report: "Sectarian Disturbances in Baluchistan; </F>
Fatalities in Iran after Confrontations with the `Guards'] 
  [Text] Paris -- The Iranian authorities yesterday admitted 
the occurrence of disturbances in the province of Baluchistan 
southeast of the country and accused "counterrevolutionary 
elements" of organizing these disturbances the day before 
yesterday. According to media reports, these disturbances 
resulted in numerous casualties, including dead and wounded. 
  According to several sources, the disturbances in Zahedan 
began after rumors that the authorities had demolished a Sunni 
mosque in the town of Mashhad northeast of Iran triggering fear 
among observers that the disturbances might assume a sectarian 
dimension. 
  Observers say that news of the disturbances coincided with 
the shooting incident as President Hashemi-Rafsanjani was 
delivering a speech during the celebrations marking the 15th 
anniversary of the Islamic revolution. They note that the two 
incidents indicate that the regime is going through a difficult 
phase. 
  It has been reported from Zahedan that forces of the 
"Revolutionary Guards" clashed with demonstrators who occupied 
government buildings, removed the flags from them, and destroyed 
military vehicles belong to the Revolutionary Guards. The 
clashes lasted four hours and resulted in the death of dozens of 
demonstrators and the injury of no less that 400 others. 
  The demonstrators used sticks and stones and the 
Revolutionary Guards responded with tear gas bombs and gunfire 
in the direction of the demonstrators. 
  Eyewitnesses say that the clashes began when forces of the 
Revolutionary Guards stormed a mosque where worshippers were 
listening to antiregime speeches after hearing the news of the 
demolition of the Sunni mosque in Mashhad. They add that the 
mosque as well as buildings and shops in the Khayyam street, 
where the clashes were concentrated, sustained material damage. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, informed sources expressed fear 
that the Zahedan incidents could be serious in view of the fact 
that the province is adjacent to the Pakistani borders and the 
fact that they occurred after the authorities reinforced their 
forces on these borders. Some media organs close to the regime 
have recently stressed the need to "foil the terrorist acts 
which the enemies of the revolution were preparing to perpetrate 
in Baluchistan." 
  The same sources also drew attention to the Foreign 
Ministry's reaction to the disturbances as "a plot hatched by 
counterrevolutionaries with foreign links." The ministry's 
statement spoke of the arrest of a number of demonstrators but 
the sources were unable to say how many were arrested.

  [Text] As you heard in the news, the head of the team of 
experts sent to Iran by Turkey confirmed that the shrapnel found 
in the Iranian border areas is from cluster bombs of the Turkish 
Air Force. Our correspondent has prepared a report on the 
operation carried out by the Turkish Air Force in northern Iraq, 
during which some bombs fell on two border villages of our 
country, killing and wounding some of our compatriots: 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Following the incident, 
meetings were held between Iranian and Turkish diplomatic 
officials. In a telephone conversation with Foreign Minister Dr. 
'Ali Akbar Velayati, the Turkish foreign minister expressed his 
regret over this incident and dispatched a team of experts to 
the area, including some officials from the Turkish Foreign 
Ministry and the joint headquarters of the Turkish Armed Forces, 
to investigate the matter. 
  After two days of investigation and inquiry in the area, 
this 
team announced the results of its survey yesterday. The head of 
the Turkish delegation confirmed that shrapnel found in the 
Iranian border areas was from the Turkish cluster bombs used by 
the Turkish Air Force last Friday. A statement was signed by 
the two sides and named The Report of the Joint Inquiry 
Commission. We interviewed 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, the deputy 
foreign minister for Asia and Oceania, regarding this incident 
and the repercussions of such occurrences on reciprocal 
relations, which you will now hear: 
  [Borujerdi] All evidence points to the fact--especially in 
view of the large number of fighter planes that participated in 
these operations and the close proximity of the PKK [Workers' 
Party of Kurdistan] centers on Iraqi territory to our 
villages--that there was no definite intent to attack our 
territory. We have signed a statement because the rockets and 
bombs fell on our soil and the Turkish side has repeatedly 
expressed its extreme regret during the past two days. 
  Turkish officials have announced that they are willing to 
compensate for the losses, which is quite natural. I believe 
that with the cooperation of the two sides, we will be able to 
attain results. This incident is a source of immense regret for 
all. Foreign Ministry officials express their condolences to the 
families of the victims. We hope that we can defend our 
national interests with regard to this incident. 
  [Correspondent] What kind of bad effects can such incidents 
have on bilateral relations? 
  [Borujerdi] It is natural that negative incidents can have 
concomitant deleterious effects. It is important that such 
incidents be prevented in the future. I have clearly brought 
this up with the Turkish ambassador. We have officially 
requested of the Turkish Government that if they carry out any 
military operations in the future they should do so after 
careful study so that there is no encroachment on our soil.

  [Text] Ankara, Feb. 3, IRNA -- Turkey is ready to 
compensate for the losses inflicted on the Iranian borders as a 
result of the air raid last Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin said here today. 
  "Unfortunately we were informed that some mistake had 
occurred during the operation of the Turkish fighters in 
northern Iraq last Friday, and resulted in losses in man and 
material on Iran. We are deeply sorry for the incident," Cetin 
told IRNA in an interview here. 
  He said relations between the two countries are so strong 
and 
friendly which can settle all the difficulties. No issue can 
affect the two countries' relations, he added, stressing "there 
was no intention behind the incident." 
  Peoples of Iran and Turkey have been living together without 
any unpleasant problems for centuries, besides, expansion of 
Tehran-Ankara cooperation not only would serve the interests of 
the two nations, but would have very positive impacts on the 
regional developments, Cetin said. 
  Turkish warplanes attacked bases of the opposition 
guerrillas 
110 kms. deep inside Iraq last Friday, during which rural areas 
in Sardasht border region were also bombed, and 28 Iranians were 
killed and wounded. 
  In addition to the two countries cooperation within the 
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), Cetin said 
implementation of the gas transfer projects from Central Asia to 
Turkey and Europe via Iran, as well as transfer of the Iranian 
gas to the world markets via Turkey would play a major role in 
the expansion of ties and cooperation between the two countries. 
  Iranian Ambassador to Turkey Mohammad Reza Baqeri met with 
Cetin earlier in the day and conveyed a message from Iranian 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati on the issue. 
  Velayati in his message stressed that Iran really expects 
the 
Turkish Government to compensate for the losses in addition to 
making a formal apology over the incident.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Mubarak's Visit to Turkey"] </F>
  [Text] President Mubarak arrived in Ankara at the head of a 
delegation for a one-day working visit on 1 February. He 
returned to Cairo after holding talks with President Demirel and 
several other officials on the same day. The press release 
issued after his talks said the sides agreed on the need to 
improve their mutual cooperation in every field. It said that 
the sides agreed to make a joint effort to contribute toward the 
establishment of peace in the Middle East and the Balkan region 
and help Iraq maintain its territorial integrity. 
  President Mubarak was visiting Turkey for the third time 
since 1985. His recent visit has unveiled the nature of 
relations and contacts between Ankara and Cairo. Obviously, the 
aim was to improve bilateral political, economic, cultural, and 
military relations. The cooperation between Turkey and Egypt is 
important because of their situation in the region and relations 
with the Zionist regime. President Ezer Weizman visited Turkey 
for four days last week. In a statement in Ankara, he said that 
cooperation among Israel, Turkey, and Egypt will determine the 
future of the Middle East. 
  Several political experts are convinced that the intensive 
diplomatic contacts among the three countries may be a prelude 
to the signing of an agreement on developments in the region. 
Undoubtedly, the United States will support that agreement, 
which will enable the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, and the Zionist 
regime to establish a common policy to protect themselves 
against threats. Undoubtedly, the main threat against Turkey, 
Egypt, and the Zionist regime is the strengthening and spreading 
of Islam and Islamic activities. 
  Another aspect of relations between Turkey and Egypt is 
aimed 
at creating the conditions required for the normalization of 
relations between Israel and the Arab countries and the removal 
of the Arab embargo on the Zionist regime. In view of that, 
political experts are convinced that promoting and strengthening 
relations among Egypt, Turkey, and Israel are aimed at placing 
limits on independent policies and slowing down and reducing the 
progress of Islamic movements in the region.

Our correspondent reports: [passage omitted] 
  Upon his arrival to Tehran, Mr. Bolkiah said that the 
expansion of relations in all fields was the most important aim 
of his visit to our country. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani spoke on the visit of the sultan of 
Brunei, saying: 
  [Begin Rafsanjani recording] Brunei is an Islamic country, 
its people are committed Muslims, and its government and people 
are all Muslims and our brothers. 
  In our foreign policy we give priority to Islamic countries. 
I had asked the esteemed sultan of Brunei to visit Iran to 
discuss common religious issues and the current situation in the 
world of Islam, which necessitates cooperation among Islamic 
countries. Also his excellency can become more familiar with 
Iran and we can get to know Brunei better. We can also assess 
any kind of cooperation which may exist between us and Brunei. 
In any case, we believe that further cooperation among Islamic 
countries is in the interests of Muslims and their countries. 
We hope to pave the way for further cooperation and become 
closer to each other. [end recording]

  [Text] During their talks Thursday night [3 February], the 
president of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Sultan of 
Brunei discussed and exchanged views on the latest world 
developments, regional issues, and bilateral cooperation between 
Iran and Brunei. 
  During the talks, Hashemi-Rafsanjani thanked Hassanal 
Bolkiah 
for visiting Iran and expressed the hope that mutual cooperation 
would further deepen in all cultural, political, economic and 
technical fields. 
  The president added: Our foreign policy gives a particular 
priority to cooperation with Islamic countries -- your country 
is one of them -- and that is a very good factor for the further 
expansion of cooperation between us. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: 
We are aware of your satisfactory stances vis-a-vis the problem 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina at the Islamic Conference Organization 
[ICO]. We hope to be able to increase the ICO activities. 
  Our country's president pointed out the existence of the 
Association of South East Asian Nations and the Economic 
Cooperation Organization in the two mainly Muslim regions, and 
described cooperation between Iran and Brunei as an effective 
factor that can contribute toward further cooperation between 
the two regions. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani also stressed the need for the two 
countries' cooperation in the oil and gas industries and 
announced Iran's readiness to help Brunei with its technical and 
scientific needs in those industries. The president also 
welcomed the two countries' cooperation in cultural and artistic 
fields. 
  Then the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, thanked our 
country's president for his kind remarks and praised the certain 
and valuable status of the Islamic Republic of Iran at global 
levels and said: Brunei has always supported Iran's principled 
and progressive stance in international circles and believes 
itself in such stances. 
  He added: We cooperate very well within the ICO and the 
Non-Aligned Movement. We have always condemned the aggression 
against the Bosnian Muslims and are ready to help them. We are 
ready to cooperate in the oil and gas industries and hope to be 
able to witness the expansion of relations between the two 
countries in all fields, particularly cultural fields.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Visit of Turkish Experts to </F>
Iran's Border] 
  [Text] Turkish military aircraft fired rockets and dropped 
bombs on several of the villages affiliated with Sar Dasht on 
Iran's border with Iraq on Friday, 28 January. Some 28 people 
were either killed or wounded as a result of the air attack. 
Meanwhile, significant damage was done in the villages. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry officials 
contacted their counterparts in Turkey and expressed concern 
over the incident. They also urged Turkey to offer a convincing 
explanation for the operation. Turkish officials rejected the 
claims that the attack on Iranian villages was preplanned by the 
Turkish Government and stressed that the target of the air 
attack was the Kurdish Workers Party camps in northern Iraq. 
However, the disclosure made by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Borujerdi after his meeting with the Turkish ambassador in 
Tehran indicated that Iran's officials wanted Turkey to 
seriously assess the matter. Undoubtedly, a more detailed 
assessment could be made if Turkey decides to dispatch a 
delegation to study the situation in the bombed areas and visit 
the wounded people. 
  According to the political experts, the Turkish officials 
must provide a convincing explanation about the attack on Iran's 
border. This is necessary because Turkey and Iran have common 
borders. Furthermore, they are very sensitive about the 
maintenance of border security and stability. That is confirmed 
by the talks the Turkish and Iranian committees have held on 
border security during the past 18 months. Obviously, the 
Iranian Foreign Ministry officials' call for an inquiry into 
this incident can be described as an initiative based on 
good-neighborly relations. 
  However, that approach can only be maintained if the Turkish 
officials seriously consider the magnitude of their military 
operations against opposition forces and avoid any move that may 
harm the cooperation between the two neighboring countries.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] As you have heard in the news, clashes have 
escalated between Algerian Government forces and the Islamist 
opponents of the regime. According to a report disseminated by 
the Algerian Government, seven people were killed in one of 
these clashes. Unofficial neutral sources announced yesterday 
that ever since General Liamine Zeroual assumed power as 
surrogate president of the former Ruling Council, nearly 60 
people have been killed in clashes between government forces and 
antiregime opponents. 
  According to political observers, the intensification of the 
conflict in Algeria has further reduced any hopes of a political 
solution to the country's crisis. In his first speech after his 
appointment by the former coupist council, General Zeroual 
promised the Algerian people that the way would be paved for a 
political solution to the country's crisis by initiating a 
dialogue with opponents. 
  These observers believe that the current trend in Algeria is 
no different than that which prevailed in the era of the former 
Ruling Council and that there are no indications that the 
government intends to resolve the political crisis. The release 
of political prisoners, the lifting of the state of emergency, 
and the change of approach toward opposing groups and factions 
are among the factors that could pave the way for a solution to 
the multifaceted crisis in Algeria. 
  If the newly appointed government of General Zeroual wishes 
to tread the same path blazed by the former Ruling Council in 
its attitude to opponents, it will certainly face a crisis and 
will not have a better fate than the members of the former 
Ruling Council, who were forced to step down at the beginning of 
this week. 
  The use of the military has never been effective in 
resolving a widespread political crisis, and the newly appointed 
Algerian Government is being forced by the insolvent economy to 
adopt a quick political solution. For the past few days, the 
Algerian Government has been announcing to all its creditors 
that it cannot pay its foreign debts, which only confirms its 
bankruptcy.

  [Text] India and Germany have expressed concern at the 
dangers posed by religious extremism. The prime minister, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl called for immediate 
steps to check the spread of this threat. Briefing newsmen on 
the one-to-one talks between Mr. Rao and Dr. Kohl, an official 
spokesman said in Bonn that the two leaders discussed 
Indo-Pakistan relations. The prime minister reiterated that 
India is in favor of peaceful relations with Pakistan. Mr. Rao, 
however, regretted that despite New Delhi's efforts, the 
Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has taken a 
strident view. Referring to the package of proposals offered by 
India following the recent foreign secretary-level talks, Mr. 
Rao expressed the hope that continuance of worthwhile dialogue 
will yield positive results. During the talks, Bonn promised to 
take steps to speed up access of German technology to India. 
The German chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl, said bottlenecks, if 
any, will be removed. He promised to support India in its 
dealings with the European Union. Germany has a prominent place 
in the Union. Our correspondent, S. Sudarshanam, understands 
that Mr. Rao spoke about human rights environment in India and 
the steps taken to protect and promote the human rights 
aspirations of the people. Earlier, the German foreign affairs 
minister, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, called on the prime minister. 
  The prime minister is visiting Berlin later today. Our 
special correspondent, Karuppaswamy, reports: 
  [Begin Karuppaswamy recording] Berlin is one of the very big 
cities in the world outside India with a full-fledged museum 
dedicated exclusively to Indian art. There are several streets 
named after Ravindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Indira 
Gandhi. And Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose visited the city for 
the possible assistance during freedom struggle. Mr. Narasimha 
Rao will be received by the federal president, Dr. Richard Von 
Weizsacker. His engagements during his two days of visit to 
Berlin include a meeting with the governing mayor of the city, 
the German indologists, and representatives of the industry and 
commerce. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "How Iraq Foiled America's </F>
Opportunity To Colonize the World"] 
  [Text] In his book "Seize The Moment: America's Challenge 
in a One Superpower World," former U.S. President Richard Nixon 
admits that cursed criminal George Bush's idealistic dream of 
establishing a new world order has been shattered by three main 
factors: Iraq's liberation of the governorate of Kuwait, the 
alertness of the national movement in Russia and Eastern Europe 
which opposes U.S. hegemony, and the failure of the capitalist 
system, the market economy, in Eastern Europe. 
  Nixon says that the liberation of the governorate of Kuwait 
was a serious turning point which changed and confused U.S. 
plans, and exposed the false cover that gave the impression that 
the world was stable and willing and ready to accept the U.S. 
dream of leading the world. The liberation of the governorate 
of Kuwait has disrupted the U.S. attempt to calmly colonize the 
world without any fanfare. But, the Mother of Battles changed 
the basic components on which criminal Bush had depended to 
control the world. That's why Nixon describes the plan of 
cursed Bush to establish a world order under U.S. leadership as 
an idealistic dream that faced and was shattered by solid 
reality. 
  This is the gist of what Nixon had admitted. All that we 
have done is replace the spiteful words he used to describe 
Iraq. Thus, Nixon joins the convoy of those who admit that the 
Mother of Battles was the midwife which gave birth to the 
factors of rejection and confrontation of U.S. colonialism, and 
has exposed the U.S. impotence in quelling the people and 
nations and controlling them. 
  When we used to say this before Nixon's book was published, 
some would view what we said as some sort of exaggeration, or 
unrealistic wishful thinking. But, here we have the strongest 
U.S. President after Kennedy admitting that the Mother Battles 
and Iraq's leader, Saddam Husayn, have changed the course of the 
major big events in the world and steered them in a direction 
that is opposite to that wished by criminal Bush. The era of 
fierce resistance to U.S. colonialism has thus begun.

official visit to our country on 3 February. At a news 
conference he held at the airport before leaving Tunisia, he 
said that President Zine El Abidine had a unique personality and 
that his analyses were very clear. He also stressed the need to 
intensify exchanges between the two countries, indicating that 
the current export of Tunisian phosphate symbolized the new 
relations that the two countries intended to establish. In the 
same context, he said that he hoped President Ben Ali would pay 
a visit to Argentina, adding that such a visit would offer new 
opportunities to deepen bilateral relations on the one hand and 
to deepen Argentina's relations with the Arab world on the other 
hand. 
  The Argentine minister also talked about the importance of 
strengthening bilateral relations as a necessary phase for the 
building of relations between regional groupings, such as the 
Arab Maghreb Union and the Organization of Cooperation and Trade 
for Latin American countries [as heard]. He then touched on the 
subject of South-South cooperation, saying that he had discussed 
this matter with President Ben Ali and that strengthening 
bilateral relations between developing countries was the only 
way to improve the level of cooperation between the countries of 
the southern hemisphere. Finally, he announced that the 
Argentine economy minister would visit Tunisia next April and 
said he hoped this visit would open important prospects for a 
fruitful exchange between businessmen in the two countries. 
  The Argentine minister handed President Ben Ali a written 
message from President Carlos Menem yesterday. The minister 
also told President Ben Ali that his country was looking forward 
to his forthcoming visit, saying he hoped that it would take 
place as soon as possible because it would contribute to the 
intensification of the good relations of cooperation between the 
two countries.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
she has most strongly and positively put across the Pakistan 
case on Kashmir issue, situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
other international issues in Davos and Geneva. Addressing a 
news conference at Islamabad Airport today on her return from a 
week-long tour of Davos, Geneva, Zagreb, and Sarajevo Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto said the image of Pakistan in the international 
community has been enhanced. We were able to project the 
positive image of Pakistan on the question of investment 
climate, our just stand on Kashmir, and on expression of 
solidarity with the Bosnian Muslims. Pakistan has achieved the 
objective of drawing world attention toward human rights 
violations in occupied Kashmir and the plight of the Bosnian 
Muslims. 
  The prime minister said according to her promise to the 
people of Pakistan and Kashmir, she presented the Kashmir case 
before the Human Rights Commission. It is Pakistan's basic 
policy to repeatedly arouse the world conscience over Indian 
atrocities in occupied Kashmir. Replying to questions on 
threats from Indian leaders, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said no amount 
of threats or intimidation can deter us from our principled 
stand on Kashmir and support to the Kashmiri people's right of 
self-determination. We are fully capable of defending our 
integrity against any aggression, she added. 
  To another question, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said while agreeing 
to the talks with India, we have sent a powerful signal to New 
Delhi that Pakistan believes in talks. We also wanted to tell 
the world that there is a government in Pakistan, which despite 
strong domestic pressures, is capable of taking even unpopular 
decisions in the larger interests of peace. Pakistan, she 
added, cannot be expected to be engaged in talks with India in 
an atmosphere where the Kashmiri people may feel that we are 
colluding with Indian repressions. She said a resolution is 
being moved in the Human Rights Commission for violations in 
Kashmir. Pakistan has conveyed to the world that it is not a 
matter of number to win maximum votes, but it is a matter of 
principle. She said special envoys are being sent to various 
countries to muster support. 
  On the investment climate, Ms. Benazir Bhutto was hopeful 
for 
a boost in foreign investment in Pakistan in the wake of the new 
atmosphere of political and economic stability prevailing in the 
country. She said foreign investors are also going to open a 
Pakistan Trade Center in Zurich to get international market for 
Pakistani products. 
  On her visit to Sarajevo, the prime minister said she and 
Turkish Prime Minister Madam Tansu Ciller succeeded in diverting 
world attention toward the plight of Bosnian people. Narrating 
the woeful human rights situation in Bosnia, Ms. Benazir Bhutto 
said people are getting sick and weak. They have no food, no 
medicine, no water, and no electricity. We salute the brave 
people of Bosnia who are living in a very difficult situation, 
but are fighting for their independence and territorial 
integrity.

  [Text] President Husni Mubarak has stressed that economic 
reforms in the coming stage should take into account social 
justice in order to achieve the objective of protecting the 
low-income groups. 
  President Mubarak said that Egyptians are committed to the 
continuation of the economic reform program, even though they 
have suffered from some of its side effects, because they 
realize that today's sacrifices will ensure economic prosperity 
in the future. 
  In a comprehensive interview with the French magazine 
POLITIQUE INTERNATIONALE [INTERNATIONAL POLICY], President 
Mubarak said fundamentalism is a phenomenon that exists in all 
societies and it is wrong to view it as concerning only Islam. 
He added that the real objective of the terrorist groups is to 
seize power and they are using Islam as a cover. 
  The president said: We are capable of resolving the 
terrorism problem and of putting it in its true perspective. 
  He also stressed that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles is irrevocable because it reflects the feelings of 
the great majority of Palestinians and Israelis even though the 
agreement is not ideal. He added that the UN resolutions are 
the reference point and framework for the peace process and that 
the current negotiations are hard and need both patience and 
time. He stressed that history does not repeat itself. 
  On the current Arab developments, President Mubarak said: No 
one is happy with the Iraqi people's tribulations. We are 
looking forward to the day when it will be over.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan in Peshawar on "text" of </F>
interview with unidentified head of the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah 
al-Musallahah Political and Sharia Committee by unidentified 
AL-WASAT reporter -- place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] 
The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah al-Musallahah [AIG] in Algeria has 
disclosed its political, military, and religious objectives, in 
the first press statements since it launched its armed 
operations in November, 1991, in which it claimed responsibility 
for most of the operations in Algeria, including assassinations 
and advising foreigners to leave the country. 
  The head of the political and sharia committee spoke to 
AL-WASAT, having been authorized by "the amir of the jama'ah" 
[the prince of the group] Sayfallah Ja'far about the ideology, 
plans, and relations of the group. He explained that it has 
supporters in 39 out of Algeria's 48 governorates, and that the 
jama'ah is held to be "an extension of the jihad of Shaykh 
Mustafa Buway'ali". He emphasized that the jihad will be 
sustained, since "we do not recognize the secular separation of 
the military and political action". He considered the presence 
of foreigners in his country to be "part of a colonialist 
infidel scheme", who, he said, represent the throbbing heart of 
every occupation and are spies for the infidel in the land of 
Islam". He criticized the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] . He 
commended the Afghan jihad, indicating that "we are in their 
debt", noting that many of the Algerians who fought in 
Afghanistan had joined the AIG. 
  It is to be recalled that the AIG recently decided to unite 
the armed groups in Algeria, leaving out the FIS, whose present 
leaders "sold out on the cause". A few days ago, it distributed 
a statement in Peshawar, in which it pointed out that the "unity 
meeting" among the military factions decided to merge there 
groups under the designation of "the Armed Islamic Group". 
These are Abu-'Adlan 'Abd-al-Haqq al-'Ayayidah, Dr. Abu-Ahmad 
and his group, and Abu- 'Abd-al-Rahman Sayyid Tarrani and his 
delegation representing Shaykh al-Malyani. Sayfallah Ja'far was 
assigned the leadership. The conferees formed a leading council 
comprising military, shura, political, and media bodies and 
decided on the following: 
  1. The formulation of a comprehensive, national strategy in 
the area of military operations. 
  2. The formulation of an accurate informational plan to 
surmount the barrier of an internal and external news blackout. 
  3. The organization of the masses to the greatest possible 
effectiveness. 
  4. Streamlining the arms procurement networks and 
instituting new networks. 
  5. Instituting fund raising and spending networks. 
  6. Conducting a survey of the number of martyrs, mujahidin, 
prisoners, with a view to looking after their families and their 
needs. 
  7. Breaking the siege of the central governorates by 
widening the base of operations so as to encompass the entire 
country. 
  8. Keeping track of and killing traitors of the movement 
[al-khawanah al-harakiyin], and sellers (hypocrites and spies). 
  9. Keeping the AIG under control, using shura laws, and 
spreading the shari'ah in the ranks of the mujahidin. 
  It is known that a number of the AIG members, who fell, or 
those who are still fighting, have participated in the Afghan 
jihad. The AIG issues a weekly publication in Peshawar called 
"AL-ANSAR" although it does not say that it speaks for the AIG. 
It is printed abroad and distributed in Peshawar to Arabs who 
fought in Afghanistan. 
  The following is the text of the interview with AL-WASAT, 
which is the first press interview with one of the AIG leaders, 
who received the AL-WASAT questions in Peshawar and sent them 
abroad to receive answers to them. All this has taken place in 
secrecy for security reasons: 
  [AL-WASAT] When the AIG was established? 
  [Unidentified AIG Leader] In previous interviews, we said 
that the AIG is not a newborn, but it has deep roots in the 
world of Islamic jihad. In other words, the AIG is an extension 
to the jihad of Shaykh Mustafa Buway'ali, may God have mercy on 
his soul. Above all, the AIG is an extension to the first major 
battle which took place between the believers and the infidels; 
namely, the Badr Battle, which took place between the prophet, 
may God peace and blessing be upon him, and the infidels of 
Quraysh. 
  From an organizational, practical, and combat viewpoint, it 
began in 1989, following the release of Shaykh Mustafa's aides 
from prison, particularly Shaykh al-Malyani, may God have mercy 
on his soul. Contacts then began within the ranks of those who 
believe that jihad is a must when Islam is not implemented, when 
the Muslims' land is usurped, when Muslim women are taken 
captives, or when Muslim men are captured. As we expected, many 
youths have joined Shaykh al-Malyani. Other cells from villages 
and quarters, which were also preparing themselves for armed 
jihad, have also joined Shaykh al-Malyani. In addition to this, 
the youths who fought in Afghanistan have also joined the 
shaykh. This is how the AIG was established. It later issued a 
statement called "the unity statement" in which they explained 
some of the main points of the the program of action. 
  Direct military action began on 18 November 1991, 
approximately two years after it was established and after 
recruiting the cadres on which jihad depends pursuant to God's 
order: Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of 
your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into the 
hearts of the enemies of God and your enemies. [koranic verse] 
  Decisionmaking is based on shari'ah and the counselors' 
opinions. This means that the AIG is based on a set of rules 
that are already defined in books of jurisprudence and Islamic 
politics of the pious predecessors, ulema, and reliable imams, 
may God have mercy on their souls. 
  Concerning its military weight, it is responsible for most 
of 
the operations that are carried out in the country, foremost of 
which are assassinations and the deportation of the foreigners, 
crusaders, and Jews. It exists in approximately 39 governorates 
out of the country's 48 governorates. 
  [AL-WASAT] Was the AIG affected by the Afghan jihad? 
  [AIG Leader] The blessed Afghan jihad has affected many 
Muslims in the whole world. It has many advantages which can 
only be denied by the unjust ones. 
  [AL-WASAT] Do you believe in change brought about by 
political action, or, to put it concisely, by violence? 
  [AIG Leader] Your question prompts us to raise another 
important question. What do you mean by "political action"? 
If, by political action, you mean joining suspect parliaments 
and alliances, holding dialogue with tyrants, accepting the 
judgment of infidelity rather than Islam, and having recourse to 
international laws, such as the United Nations, the 
International Court of Justice, and other Judeo-Christian 
organizations, then it is the duty of every Muslim to disown and 
repudiate such organizations. The mere thought of having 
recourse to these organizations is against God's orders, let 
alone joining them. 
  If, however, you mean by political action following Islamic 
policy as agreed upon by the ulema of this nation, which 
includes jihad and the promotion of virtue and suppression of 
vice, then this is at the heart of our religion, indeed the peak 
of it. Taking such a course of action is a collective duty, 
which later becomes an individual duty. As for what you term 
violence, this is a misrepresentation of God's words and is 
meant to deceive the people. How can we consider "jihad for the 
cause of God" as violence? Can any Muslim allow himself to say 
this about God's words, unless he is a believer in the laws of 
the East and the West, which serve their own interests? We do 
not recognize the secular separation between military and 
political action. 
  [AL-WASAT] Why have you attacked foreigners, and what is the 
message you want to deliver? 
  [AIG Leader] We attacked foreigners (Jews, Christians, and 
polytheists) because they are part of an infidel, colonialist, 
scheme. They represent a living artery and throbbing heart of 
every occupation, be it external or domestic, explicit or 
implicit. Also, those foreigners are spies for the infidels in 
the Islamic world. In addition, those foreigners represent a 
mainstay of the economy. If they live in peace, then this means 
that the country is leading a normal life. However, killing and 
fighting them is practical evidence of the weakness of the 
infidel regime and the return of Islam as prophesied by the 
prophet, may God's peace be upon him. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-WASAT] There are reports about Iranian aid and 
facilities from other neighboring states. How true is this? Do 
you receive foreign support and how do you finance your military 
operations? 
  [AIG Leader] Iran is a Shiite state, and so we cannot 
receive aid from it. God Almighty has saved us the trouble. 
But to God belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, 
but the hypocrites understand not. [Koranic verse] 
  [AL-WASAT] What are the goals that you aspire to achieve by 
armed action? 
  [AIG Leader] It is a jihad for the cause of God, and not 
armed action. Our only objective is to see God's law prevail, 
make people worship God, end injustice and debauchery, and 
achieve justice as the Koran orders us to do. By doing this, we 
seek only to win God's satisfaction, and nothing else. 
  [AL-WASAT] What is the nature of your relationship with the 
Salvation Front, and can you ignore it? Suppose a change takes 
place, are you qualified to fill the vacuum in terms of the 
cadres, the army, police, security, etc? 
  [AIG Leader] What front do you mean? There are many fronts, 
many branches, and many spokesmen. Be more specific so that we 
can give you an answer. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-WASAT] Several names in the Algerian arena adopt 
violence. What are the major groups in terms of strength and 
presence in the arena of military action? 
  [AIG Leader] There is a great clamor regarding this. Those 
who read local and international press believe that the number 
of the armed group exceeds 600 or 1,000 sometimes. This is 
incredible; it is a legendary figure. The objective and purpose 
of this are well known. The media wants to show the world that 
there is conflict in order to frustrate the Muslims and create 
confusion in their ranks. God willing, events will prove that 
certain people only are burdening themselves with the blessed 
jihad. 
  [AL-WASAT] The FIS has formed an army. Are you ready to join 
it or cooperate with it? 
  [AIG Leader] We would like to ask: Which front are you 
talking about and which army do you mean. Many statements have 
been made regarding this army now that capitulatory peaceful 
solutions have become imminent. The AIG is carrying the banner 
of "There Is No God but Allah" in the battlefield. We have not 
heard about this army nor sensed its reality. He who has 
anything else to say should prove it inside, in the land of fire 
and dust, not in the Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, or Hilton 
Hotels. 
  [AL-WASAT] If the FIS reaches a compromise with the Algerian 
regime, what will be your response? 
  [AIG Leader] The Mujahidin Shura Council and the Islamic 
Courts will decide what should be done if such a thing takes 
place. 
  [AL-WASAT] Do your attacks on Rabeh Kebir and Abdallah Anas 
represent your opposition to them personally or to the FIS? 
  [AIG Leader] We oppose policies, not persons; we oppose 
actions, not faces. In the end, we oppose all those who leave 
the battlefield and escape the tremor. Previous experiments 
alone are not criteria to judge people. The pretext that they 
participated in the fighting in the past but they have abandoned 
it now is not accepted. What counts is the end, not the 
beginning. You can judge all those who are in your mind in 
accordance with this rule. 
  [AL-WASAT] What is the next strategy of the military action? 
Do you believe that the previous operations or strategy will be 
followed? 
  [AIG Leader] We cannot now define a specific strategy. 
Continuing or changing the strategy depends on many tactical, 
geographical, social, and military factors. Therefore, we 
cannot deal with this now. However, some explorations here and 
there would reveal the features of the coming stage, God willing. 
  [AL-WASAT] What kind of relationship is there between you 
and the military action groups in Egypt and other Arab states? 
  [AIG Leader] It is a relationship that the holy Koran has 
ordered us to develop. "But if they seek your aid in religion, 
it is your duty to help them" [Koranic verse]. In the same 
vein, the messenger of God, God's peace and blessings be upon 
him, says: "All Muslims are brothers. They must not fail, 
disgrace, or wrong each other." [passage omitted] 
  [AL-WASAT] When you select the targets of your military 
operations, do you mean to convey a political message or signal 
beyond the operation itself, or is the objective is just to kill 
without intending to convey any signals? 
  [AIG Leader] Targets for military operations are selected in 
implementation of God's words: "And slay them wherever you catch 
them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for 
tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter." [Koranic verse] 
  [AL-WASAT] A change in any state must cover many and various 
fields, especially in view of the fact that social, political, 
and economic relations are interlinked. Through your action, we 
notice that you focus on the military aspect only. 
  [AIG Leader] Establishing the pillars of the Muslim 
caliphate 
requires greater efforts by us. We are still at the beginning. 
We have not arrived at the stage that will enable us to think 
of such issues. Now we should stand firmly on the ground. 
Afterward, God will help us go ahead. "And those who strive in 
our cause, we will certainly guide them to our paths; for verily 
God is with those who do right." [Koranic verse] 
  [AL-WASAT] Any armed movement or revolution needs 
traditional 
leaders or symbols. Do you have such symbols? Are you capable 
of winning such symbols? Who among the Algerian personalities 
would you nominate for leading your action? 
  [AIG Leader] The existence of symbols is not a prerequisite 
for waging jihad. It is favorable and nice to have symbols. 
But if we suppose--and this is the actual situation in 
Algeria--that there is no specific symbol, will jihad cease to 
exist as a duty? This jihad began without outstanding symbols. 
It began with the youth. From the womb of the ordeal, symbols 
will be born, God willing. 
  As for the nomination of leading personalities, certain 
conditions must be observed. In addition to some leadership 
traits that must be exist in the symbol, he must have 
participated in jihad and military operations and must have 
killed a considerable number of the enemies of God.

  [Text] Brigadier 'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad Husayn, the 
interior minister, issued a statement a few moments ago about 
developments in the evil aggression by gunfire against 
worshipers in the mosque of the town Quarter One at al-Thawrah 
in Omdurman as well as later developments in the incident. 
  He made it clear that the joint efforts of the interior 
minister, the people's Armed Forces, the general security and 
the citizens had made it possible to establish the identity, 
descriptions, and names of the criminals. He added that 
investigations had not ceased since the incident took place. 
  [Words indistinct] in the three towns [Khartoum, Omdurman,

the statement on the identities of the criminals late this 
afternoon, the criminals moved with the intention of fleeing 
after they had been exposed, but the different security 
organizations were waiting for them. There was an exchange of 
gunfire as a result of which three of the criminals were killed. 
  They are: 'Abd-al-Baqi Yusuf and Yasir Muhammad Ali from 
West Africa. The third was wounded. He is Muhammad Abdullah 
'Abd-al-Rahman al-Khilayfi from Arab North Africa. He was taken 
to hospital. 
  The minister of the interior said that documents had been 
discovered and confirmed the dimension of this conspiratorial 
[word indistinct] incident which our people and their peaceful 
traditions (?do not accept). His Excellency commended the 
vigilance of the citizens and their cooperation with the 
security organs which helped capture the criminals.

  [Text] Khartoum, 6 Feb (PANA) -- The Sudanese interior 
minister, Brigadier 'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammed Husayn, said on 
Sunday that there was no connection between gunmen who assaulted 
a mosque in the Sudanese capital and the Takfir and Hijra 
Islamic fundamentalist organization. He told a press conference 
in Khartoum that investigations so far have revealed no link. 
  Takfir and Hijra Islamic group first originated in Egypt 
during the Sadat era and was famous for terrorist activities. 
The members regarded all Moslems of today as "infidels." 
  Husayn said the death toll in the attack on worshippers at 
the Khartoum Ansar Souna mosque on Friday had risen to 16 with 
20 injured. The motive of the gunmen is still not known. He 
said two of the suspected gunmen, who were West Africans, have 
been killed in a shootout with security forces. The third 
suspect, a Moroccan whom he identified as Muhammad Abdullah 
al-Khilayfi, was injured. 
  Husayn said the gunmen, who were originally three, first 
attacked a police station at Umbadda neighbourhood, injured two 
policemen and took five Kalashnikov rifles and a Yugoslav gun. 
They seized a pick-up truck from a civilian at gunpoint outside 
the police station and drove back home where they collected 
their personal effects and headed for the mosque. Husayn said 
before they reached the mosque, the gunmen neutralised a police 
station along their way to make their operation smooth. The 
minister said during a shootout on Saturday with the security 
forces who had tracked them down, a fourth person, a Yemeni, 
appeared with the group. 
  The Yemeni and the Moroccan, Muhammad Abdullah al-Khilayfi, 
were critically injured and cannot be interrogated at the 
moment. The minister said the security agencies are also 
holding a Palestinian student for suspicion of involvement in 
the massacre. He added, however, that interrogation so far has 
not linked him to the massacre.

  [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks, 
casting doubt on the ability of the Egyptian regime to control 
the internal situation and win the struggle with the Islamists, 
have angered the Egyptian authorities. The authorities have 
summoned Israeli Ambassador in Cairo David Sultan and handed him 
an official letter of protest, demanding an apology by his 
government. 
  Rabin's remarks came in a meeting with Israeli thinkers and 
writers the day before yesterday. Rabin said he is not sure 
Egypt could remain committed to the peace treaty should the 
"terrorist" groups take power. The Egyptian Government received 
detailed reports on Rabin's remarks from the Egyptian Embassy in 
Tel Aviv. 
  The Egyptian Labor Federation issued a statement in Cairo 
the 
day before yesterday calling on its members not to meet an 
Israeli Histadrut delegation and confirming the continuation of 
the Egyptian federation's boycott of its Israeli counterpart.

  [Text] President Muhammad Husni Mubarak has announced his 
approval of Defense Minister Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi's 
request to increase the capital of the Fighters Care Fund from 
50 to 100 million pounds. He said that the fighters are among 
the sectors that deserve the state's care, noting that these 
funds do not come from the state's budget but from the Armed 
Forces National Projects Service Department. 
  The announcement came during President Mubarak's meeting 
with 
the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers of the 
central military zone. 
  President Mubarak arrived at the Military Sports Center in 
Manshiyat al-Bakri at 1005 today and was received by Defense 
Minister Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi; Chief of Staff 
Lieutenant General Salah Halabi; the commanders of the air, sea, 
and air defense forces; and Staff Major General 'Uthman Shahin, 
commander of the central military zone. 
  [Begin Mubarak recording] In the name of God, the 
compassionate, the merciful. Happy year to you. I am always 
pleased when I meet with our brothers and sons from the Armed 
Forces because I spent most of my life in the Armed Forces. I 
learned and was trained in the Armed Forces. 
  I had not thought of delivering a speech at today's meeting 
but I thought I should seize this opportunity to speak about 
issues and problems that concern you as a group of citizens and 
as an important and disciplined group of the people. I asked 
myself: What issues do our brothers and sons want to hear? I 
received several questions on local and foreign issues. I will 
speak to you frankly on every issue except those that affect the 
public interest, since I try not to enter into the latter's 
details at such a big gathering. 
  Speaking about local affairs, one question is: One of your 
excellency's instructions to the government is to pay attention 
to slums and to control them. Are there resources available for 
achieving this in the near future, especially given that it 
might be difficult to develop some of these areas? The slums 
issue began in the sixties and has continued to grow. People 
left the countryside for the cities, specifically Cairo and 
Alexandria. The problem grew and buildings were constructed 
without permission, without planning. Frankly, I could not pull 
down the slum areas under the previous conditions because, as 
you know, our economic situation in the early eighties was such 
that no funds were available. We did not even have resources. 
We could barely provide bread. You might remember that we held 
an economic conference in 1982 to see where we were going and 
what we were going to do about our economy, which is the 
people's livelihood. World prices rose sharply after the 
October 1973 war, including oil. Our resources from foreign 
currencies were meager and we could not pay the debt 
installments. Not only this, we could not even pay the price of 
wheat or for the citizens' basic requirements. 
  I said somewhere that in September 1990 we reached the stage 
where our foreign currency resources--from exports, oil, and 
tourism--did not exceed 5 billion, 4.5 billion, sometimes 6 
billion [currencies not specified] while we were spending 10 
billion in foreign currency. We borrowed. We bought wheat in 
installments to be paid over so many years. We reached the 
stage where we could not pay the installments. [end recording] 
  President Mubarak stressed that we paid major attention to 
the infrastructure because it was extremely necessary for 
agriculture, industry, and investments. He explained what has 
been achieved in the infrastructure field and stressed that 
unemployment would have doubled to 10 times what it is now had 
it not been for the infrastructure achievements. 
  The president explained the situation in Egypt when the 
economic reforms began and how the country succeeded in reaching 
a unique program through its discussions with the international 
financial establishments and the IMF, which no other country 
could attain. The program, he added, took into consideration the 
conditions of the low-income groups. The president added that 
this program was the bitter medicine that had to be taken to 
save the Egyptian entity and economy. 
  This was stated by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im, head of the 
Presidential Palace Press Office. He said that the president 
stressed that the economic reforms were a heavy burden and that 
the increase in prices was also a burden but were necessary for 
development. The president added: We had two choices: either 
to embark on the economic reform experiment or to avoid it, 
which would have led to a degree of deterioration that no one 
could predict. The president stressed that the only remaining 
danger now is the terrible population increase. 
  The head of the Presidential Palace Press Office added that 
the president affirmed that the economic reform program is on 
course and that we have been exempted from 30 percent of our 
debts, which will drop another percentage point in July. 
  The president stressed that this stage has (?hampered) the 
state's interest in the expanding slum areas. He said: After 
the reform we are able to look for a solution to this problem, 
proceed with improving living conditions, and develop the 
economy, especially if we manage to control the population 
increase. 
  President Mubarak touched on the sales tax, saying that 
there 
will be no price increase in the second stage of this tax, which 
will be during 1995-96. He said taxes are the state's right 
from those able to pay in favor of the ones who cannot. 
  He also explained the GATT, which allows free trade and 
services that reflect the interest of the higher purchasing 
countries and asserted that we ought to adjust ourselves and be 
ready to cooperate to face all possible consequences of this 
agreement. 
  The president said that at a time when the world is 
suffering 
hard economic conditions and soaring prices, some countries have 
begun to export terrorism to us. He affirmed that the 
terrorists who concentrate on striking at tourism as a huge 
source for the Egyptian economy have nothing to do with Islam, 
which renounces them. He described them as a handful of 
criminals and mercenaries and said that their interest is money 
and profiteering, referring to an attack on a mosque in Sudan 
yesterday in which 28 people were killed and over 100 worshipers 
were wounded [numbers as heard]. Criminals also used machine 
guns and hand grenades in attacking worshipers in a Sunni mosque 
in Pakistan. 
  'Abd-al-Mun'im said that the president discussed corruption, 
saying that some people are exaggerating it to harm our 
reputation, something that happens in other countries and from 
which no society is free. He said that Egypt has less 
corruption than other countries and that the international 
phenomenon of corruption cannot be a justification for us. All 
corruption cases are investigated no matter who is involved. 
  The president noted the numerous rumors about corruption 
designed to cause confusion and defame the state. He affirmed 
that he personally inquires about all rumors and allegations and 
in most cases investigations have proved that they were merely 
rumors. 
  The president turned to the discussion of foreign issues, 
affirming their direct link with domestic affairs. He noted 
that we are living in a world where interests are interwoven and 
that Egypt's foreign relations affect its role and standing in 
the region. The president stressed that he is committed to a 
general principle that our relations should be good with all 
countries. 
  The president also discussed the balance of power in the 
world and the new world order, referring to the major changes. 
He affirmed the need for us to deal with the new situation and 
successive changes and that we should not despair. 
  He then referred to yesterday's heinous massacre in 
Sarajevo, 
when a mortar shell landed in the city's marketplace, killing 
over 60 people and wounding about 200 others. He said that the 
European countries have an obligation to end this tragedy from 
which the Bosnian people are suffering. He emphasized that it 
is the responsibility of the major powers and the Security 
Council member states to end this tragedy. 
  President Mubarak said we have peacekeeping forces in 
Sarajevo and Somalia that are a symbol of the solidarity of an 
Islamic country with brothers in two other Islamic countries. 
He added that our Armed Forces are carrying out a first class 
humanitarian task in Somalia. 
  In his meeting with commanders, officers, and men of the 
Central Military Zone, the president dealt with the Middle East 
issue and the peace process. He noted that Egypt was the most 
courageous country to achieve peace. He said that had it not 
been for the role of the late President Anwar al-Sadat in his 
historic initiative that opened the door to all the region's 
countries, it would not have been possible to reach the current 
situation in the peace process. 
  He also discussed the Gaza-Jericho accord and Egypt's role 
in 
all phases, as well as its efforts with the United States during 
1977-1993 to make it listen to the Palestinian voice. 
  The president stressed that difficulties remain on the road 
to peace, primarily the Israeli settlements that have gone from 
40 small settlements in 1978 to 180 large ones scattered all 
over the Arab territories. He said Egypt has always been 
forthright in all its actions and policies and that there is 
still a long, complex way to go on the Palestinian issue, 
especially when a Palestinian (?administration is set up) and in 
light of subsequent dealings with humanitarian issues. 
  He affirmed that there will soon be a just solution to the 
Syrian issue, which we desire. Mubarak also dealt with Egypt's 
role in finding a solution to the Libyan-Western crisis, in 
which Egypt is helping as much as it can without intervening in 
Libya's decisionmaking.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Feb (MENA)--The Secretariat General of the 
Arab Lawyers Union strongly denounced the barbaric massacre 
committed by the Serb forces against Bosnia's Muslims in 
Sarajevo. It stressed that the massacre was the logical result 
of Europe's failure and U.S. reluctance to fulfill commitments 
toward areas of conflict. 
  In a statement today, the union said the massacre is 
consistent with undeclared intentions that are devoted to the 
ethnic liquidation and cleansing about which some countries are 
keeping silent. It also perpetuates several violations 
perpetrated by the Serb forces against innocent citizens, which 
were also ignored by the decisionmakers in the new world order. 
  The statement added that the massacre, which took place at 
the same time as the meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee in 
Geneva, highlights the Serbs' complete disregard for 
international legitimacy and human rights.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Feb (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR wonders 
whether the United Nations has become an establishment that only 
follows the orders of the major Western countries. It asks if 
the UN Charter has been amended to bless aggression against 
nations and human rights violations and reward aggressors. 
  In its editorial today, the newspaper says that the United 
Nations, the Security Council, and the major powers are adopting 
an unbelievable position and that the massacres inflicted on the 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina over the past two years reveal that 
the international organization established in 1945 to defend 
security and prevent aggression is now only a scarecrow, like 
that which farmers set up to scare off crows. 
  The paper urges the Islamic countries not to remain 
spectators to this tragedy. The blood of a Muslim nation is 
being shed and its territory has become a human slaughterhouse.

<F P=106> [Muhammad al-Sa'id Fa'iq commentary: "The Human Conscience </F>
and the Call To Save the Bosnian People"] 
  [Text] Egypt has strongly denounced the awful massacre that 
the Serbian forces carried out against Bosnian Muslims in 
Sarajevo yesterday with the arrogance of force, killing about 70 
people and wounding hundreds of others. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement called on the international 
community, represented by the Security Council, to act quickly 
to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia to enable this nation, which 
is being subjected to brutal aggression from many sources that 
have more manpower and armaments, to defend itself according to 
its right under the UN charter and international law. 
  As part of Egypt's efforts to prompt the international 
community to recognize its moral responsibilities and halt this 
brutal series of massacres in which scores of Muslim civilians 
die every day, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa held telephone 
contacts with the UN secretary general, a number of foreign 
ministers from OAU and European Union countries, and the United 
States to discuss ways of confronting this hostile escalation 
against the Bosnian people. 
  Proceeding from its moral obligation to stand by the Bosnian 
Muslim nation in its struggle against the forces of oppression 
and evil that aim to destroy it, Egypt urged the international 
community to reconsider the policies adopted to deal with the 
continuing aggression against the Bosnian people. These heinous 
massacres perpetrated by the Serb and Croat butchers all over 
Bosnia and this continuous and escalated bombardment of the 
nation, the arming of which is banned by international community 
resolutions and that has been robbed of its legitimate right to 
self-defense, confirmed the failure of these policies. 
Furthermore, these acts provide evidence that the talks held in 
a number of European capitals to find a solution to this tragedy 
have been a waste of time and will not make the international 
community support the Bosnian nation in the sovereignty of its 
territories and its right to life in peace and security. 
  We say once again that the human conscience is urged to act 
swiftly to save the Bosnian nation from the Serb and Croat 
massacres and the inaction of most of the world's governments 
that are contended with watching the violation of all ethical 
and human values in Bosnia. Human conscience is also urged to 
watch how the Serb and Croat butchers flagrantly challenge 
Security Council resolutions. 
  The latest brutal rocket shelling of Sarajevo came a few 
hours after the Security Council's strongly worded statement 
threatening economic sanctions against Croatia unless it 
withdraws its forces and military ammunition from central and 
south Bosnia within two weeks. It is the practical, military 
response of Serb and Croat murderers to the Security Council 
statement that called for respecting Bosnia's sovereignty, 
independence, and territorial integrity as a member state of the 
United Nations and that warned against acts of ethnic cleansing 
against civilians in that country. It is a response full of 
arrogance, haughtiness, and disdain for UN resolutions. 
  Human history stresses the need to confront such 
expansionist, hostile ambitions against nations and to act 
quickly to contain these racist conflicts. 
  If the Bosnian nation's fate is to suffer these brutal 
massacres while the world debates how to end this tragedy, the 
least that can be done is for the Security Council to move 
swiftly to lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnian nation, in 
accordance with its legitimate right to self-defense, can defend 
its land, honor, and right to a free and dignified life.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi by Sana' </F>
al-Sa'id; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Sa'id] Can the idea of holding a national 
dialogue in April have any credibility without the participation 
of all the country's political forces? 
  [Sidqi] All the legitimate forces will take part in this 
dialogue, regardless of their inclination. Naturally, 
illegitimate forces are excluded from this dialogue and will not 
participate in it. The dialogue, which will open in April, will 
be on political, economic, and social issues. Therefore, as 
President Husni Mubarak said, all the national forces and 
legitimate parties will participate in it. The basic aim of the 
dialogue is to arrive at an agreement that will enable us to see 
the issue of security and stability in the right perspective. 
Stability is the foundation that will allow Egyptian society to 
advance in all fields. The national dialogue also aims to draw 
a scientific and comprehensive vision of Egypt's future in the 
coming century. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Does this classification of forces as legitimate 
and illegitimate mean that the Muslim Brotherhood will not take 
part in the national dialogue? 
  [Sidqi] As I just said, only the legitimate forces will take 
part. The Muslim Brotherhood is an illegitimate and illegal 
force. Besides, the Egyptian Constitution does not allow the 
formation of religious parties. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Some people have voiced the fear that the 
national 
dialogue would turn into an aimless ramble [maklamah]. These 
people say that change is, in essence, a matter for deeds, not 
words. 
  [Sidqi] They are wrong. Dialogue is the main course for 
finding the truth and improving reality. This is our aim; to 
better ourselves in everything: politics, economy, and social 
relations. We seek solutions to problems that we all recognize: 
education, health, and development, among others. Therefore, 
it is very useful to have a dialogue on these issues. It is 
possible for us to reach an agreement on a number of principles 
that will shed light on how to resolve these problems. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Some people are afraid that the dialogue will 
turn 
into a solo performance by the National Democratic Party [NDP] 
and its sympathizers. 
  [Sidqi] The dialogue will not turn into an NDP monologue. 
Representatives from all the national and party forces will be 
present. How can it turn into a solo performance? There is no 
doubt that the dialogue will be an opportunity to exchange 
opinions, formulate a comprehensive vision of our national 
priorities, and draw police guidelines. Egypt, as President 
Mubarak said, does not aim to blur the distinction between 
opinions but to uphold the principles and prerequisites of 
democracy. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Is terrorism one of the proposed subjects in the 
dialogue? 
  [Sidqi] Of course. It is a major issue. The call for 
dialogue is also an attempt to rally efforts to formulate a 
national action plan to support stability and development, and 
to strike at terrorism to uproot it completely. But, at the 
same time, we should not exaggerate the extent of terrorism. 
Such an exaggeration is not needed. It is true that there is 
terrorism; this is an undisputed fact. But I say that the 
terrorism movement in Egypt has never been and will never be 
similar to the movements in other countries. The criteria here 
makes the difference between the two. Terrorism here is within 
narrow limits when compared to other countries. The terrorists 
certainly have their instigators and backers abroad. We know of 
the remnants who have left Egypt and have gone to other 
countries. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The remnants that went to Afghanistan? 
  [Sidqi] They went to more than one country where they 
settled 
down, trained, and carried out their activities by communicating 
with their cadres in Egypt. The latter received their 
instructions from them to carry out their criminal acts against 
the state and its citizens. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Why do you not mention specifically the countries 
that support terrorism? 
  [Sidqi] We have exposed them and there is no need to mention 
them again. They are known forces that do not want stability 
and progress for Egypt but want our country to remain burdened 
by poverty. They are tools of destruction and sabotage. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Are they Sudan and Iran? 
  [Sidqi] I do not want to accuse a specific country and I do 
not want to assert anything. But there are very strong 
possibilities that there are people residing in some surrounding 
countries or in countries near us. 
  [Al-Sa'id] There are opposition voices which say that 
political reform is the basis for eliminating terrorism and is 
the main door to dialogue. 
  [Sidqi] What do they mean by political reform? 
  [Al-Sa'id] One aspect of political reform is the guarantee 
of 
honest elections. 
  [Sidqi] Elections are always honest in Egypt. The current 
laws ensure the honesty of elections and no one here can dispute 
our elections. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Some of these voices are also demanding the 
amendment of the Constitution and believe that this Constitution 
is not being applied and is merely ink on paper. From this 
comes the call to amend it so that it can conform to current 
conditions in Egypt. 
  [Sidqi] Who has made the Constitution merely ink on paper? 
We are living in a state that respects law and this means that 
the Constitution is respected and the law is respected. There 
is no distortion or bypassing of the law. I do not understand 
what they mean when they talk about the Constitution in the 
manner suggested by your question. As to the amendment of the 
Constitution, I say that the current one is completely suitable 
for Egypt's current conditions. 
  Tampering with the Constitution is not an easy matter. The 
above-mentioned Constitution was drawn up in 1971 and therefore 
it has been in existence for only 22 years. This is not long 
enough for judging and amending the Constitution. It is not 
reasonable for us to change the Constitution each period, 
otherwise the whole process will turn into chaos. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Terrorist operations have not been eliminated 
or contained yet, despite the enforcement of the emergency law. 
On the contrary, they have become a serious phenomenon 
threatening society. 
  [Sidqi] We cannot consider terrorist incidents a phenomenon. 
Egypt is more stable and secure than other states. If some 
wicked terrorist elements appear every now and then, they are a 
misled group unaware of Egypt's interests. They are elements 
who have rebelled against the situation, law, and legitimacy. 
They are trying to impose their deviant opinion and thought on 
others by force and with violence. This runs counter to the 
simplest rules of freedom and democracy, which are the pillars 
of the regime in Egypt. They are a group that must be confronted 
firmly and decisively. We cannot describe its actions as a 
phenomenon because the overwhelming majority of the Egyptian 
people reject its unsound and illogical practices. The Egyptian 
people are among the most moderate people and adhere to their 
sound Islamic and Christian religious ideals. 
  [Al-Sa'id] However, more than one incident has shown that 
terrorism still exists, including the unsuccessful assassination 
attempt against you. 
  [Sidqi] The emergence of extremist groups that practice 
violence and terrorism is not confined to Egypt. There are 
terrorist groups in our region, Europe, and elsewhere. These 
groups lack sound logic, correct thought, and wisdom. 
Therefore, their attempts to impose their custodianship and 
ideas by terrorism and violence are confronted by the people and 
government. These groups must not be allowed to pose a threat 
to Egypt's security. We are all confident that terrorism has 
no future on our land. It will remain besieged and will be 
eradicated, God willing, because its elements are a small 
fugitive group that is motivated by a desire to destroy. God 
willing, they will disappear thanks to national consensus. 
  [Al-Sa'id] It is being said that confronting terrorism can 
be done without resorting to security measures, such as 
eliminating the shantytowns. 
  [Sidqi] We are using all security and legal methods, as well 
as development projects, to put an end to terrorism. We are 
implementing a comprehensive program to remove shantytowns in 11 
governorates. We have adopted serious steps and have allocated 
3.03 billion pounds to remove these shantytowns. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Some believe ideological dialogue can be held 
with these misled groups. 
  [Sidqi] There is a difference between extremist thinking and 
terrorism. Dialogue can be held with the first. However, 
dialogue with terrorism is useless. There can be no dialogue 
with terrorism because you cannot speak to someone who is aiming 
a gun at you. There can be no dialogue between two sides, one of 
which uses words while the other uses firearms. Is this 
possible? Of course not. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Speaking of corruption, some people accuse the 
government of ignoring the issue, especially when it affects 
some big names. 
  [Sidqi] We do not ignore any corruption case; we promptly 
refer it to prosecution. I stress here that we will not be 
lenient toward corruption; we will expose and pursue every 
corruption case no matter who is involved. President Mubarak's 
instructions are clear in this regard. Deviation from the right 
course may occur anywhere in the world, including Egypt. We and 
no one else can prevent it. This is why we have laws that combat 
deviation and treat people equally without discrimination 
between the big and the small. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The fact that the state's control authorities, 
such as the Administrative Control Organization, are affiliated 
with the Council of Ministers may raise concerns that the 
government colludes with those authorities to crush its 
adversaries and protect its friends. 
  [Sidqi] Had this been true, we would not have brought many 
big and resounding names to trial. All are equal before the law. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Like whom? 
  [Sidqi] There is no need to mention names! 
  [Al-Sa'id] Does this mean that corruption files are not 
opened selectively? Some say that while light is shed on some 
cases to discredit certain people, other cases remain on the 
shelf. 
  [Sidqi] I would like to say first that there are not that 
many corruption cases. We are against all kind of corruption, 
major, or minor. Everybody must be sure that the state is 
against any deviation from the right path. All the cases that 
came to light were discovered by the state services, such as the 
Administrative Control Organization, the intelligence services, 
state security, the public funds authority, and the central 
agency. Officials of the state's administrative service inform 
the government of any corruption case. All these agencies play 
their roles in full. I would like to draw your attention to a 
very important point here: People should not be considered 
guilty for mere suspicion. People have their entities and 
personalities. It is noted that some newspapers publish 
allegations to discredit public figures without any evidence 
against them. This, I believe, is encroachment on people's 
reputations. This is more like intellectual terrorism and a 
call to harm others wrongfully. If the government did all it 
can, referred corruption cases to courts irrespective of who is 
involved, and never interfered to affect the normal course of 
those cases, then we all must wait for the results of 
investigations so that innocent people are not condemned and 
defamed. It is a sin to wrong innocent people and condemn them 
on the basis of tendentious rumors. We are alert, and we do not 
remain silent over any corruption or deviation. We watch, 
follow, and pursue any corruption case regardless of who stands 
behind it. When suspicion about the Madinat al-Nasr millionaire 
grew and a citizen filed a complaint, we did not hesitate; we 
took prompt action. 
  [Al-Sa'id] There are many people demanding that the 
emergency law be lifted. 
  [Sidqi] The emergency law is for the public good, especially 
because Egyptian society faces the danger of terrorism, which 
must be confronted and uprooted. The emergency law is only 
applied to terrorists and drug dealers; it is the least that can 
be done to protect Egypt. Dangers to society posed by these 
terrorists require deterrence and decisiveness. The emergency 
law does not affect anyone's freedom or creed, nor does it 
affect the parties. The law is used against outlaws and, 
therefore, there is no fear from the emergency law because it 
cannot harm any innocent citizen. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But someone may ask why the emergency law exists. 
Although it has been in force since 1981, it has not contained 
or eradicated terrorism. 
  [Sidqi] Why should the emergency law bother anyone if it is 
applied only to terrorism and drugs, each of which is a damned 
disease that must be resisted with all possible means? The 
emergency law has not been used against any other party and has 
not undermined democracy. Had it not been for the democratic 
climate we are experiencing, the opposition voices would not 
dare to say one tenth of what they say now. As to the question 
of why the need for it, I say that we are in dire need of it to 
protect Egypt's stability and the lives of its citizens, and to 
secure its economy. 
  Once again, I ask why the alarm about the emergency law, 
which has not been used against any honest citizen, parties, or 
press, or to undermine democracy? There are no excesses in the 
application of the emergency law. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The opposition parties are part of the state's 
political system under the Constitution's Article 5, which 
considers the multiparty system to be the basis for the 
political regime in Egypt. 
  [Sidqi] Naturally, pluralism is the basis of the political 
system in Egypt and no one says otherwise. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But the parties do not sense this fact and feel 
that they are excluded from politics. They do not feel they are 
part of the political system and feel that the government is 
uneasy with the opposition, although it does not show it. 
  [Sidqi] How can they feel that they are not part of the 
political system with all the state's and ruling party's 
assurances that the opposition should indeed be part of the 
political system? 
  As a general rule, a genuine opposition is heeded, but still 
we find some opposition elements trying to portray everything in 
Egypt as very black. This is unreasonable and unacceptable 
because everything has two faces--beautiful and ugly, good and 
bad. 
  You saw some opposition papers recently reporting everything 
as bleak, which is untrue. Therefore, I say that the opposition 
parties are not separated from the political arena and they 
enjoy democracy in Egypt, which we see everywhere. We can see at 
the People's Assembly that the opposition enjoys the full right 
to speech and dialogue. The same applies to the Consultative 
Council, where the opposition takes more than its share of 
rights, and we do not go by the proportion criteria in allotting 
the majority and minority. The opposition parties receive every 
regard and respect, but the opposition should stick to objective 
opposition. It is not sensible for anyone to level accusations 
without evidence that the person is corrupt or bad. This is 
unlawful and I am very sorry about this situation. However, we 
deal with the opposition differently and I personally have 
numerous friends in the opposition parties, in al-Wafd, Labor, 
and other parties. 
  My criticism of the opposition is that it tarnishes people's 
images haphazardly; it tarnishes the image of everyone and the 
system, which is unacceptable. 
  [Al-Sa'id] People complain about high prices. They are 
afraid these prices will increase in the next few months. 
  [Sidqi] There will be no price increases for any commodity, 
including gasoline, in the coming period. Prices have increased 
recently but they will not increase in the future. I want to 
say that we do not interfere in raising prices. Part of the 
reason for the price increases was a correctional measure and 
the other part was higher production costs, especially of 
imported goods. We are a part of the world market. Matters 
related to prices in world markets affect us eventually. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What do you mean by saying that part of the 
reason for the higher prices was a correctional measure? 
  [Sidqi] The prices that prevailed in the past did not 
reflect the real cost or the real value of the commodities. Our 
major problem is that for a long time we have been behaving like 
an ostrich, which buries its head in the sand. While prices 
were rising in the whole world, Egypt was putting a "brake" on 
prices through subsidies. Therefore, a collapse was going to 
happen if prices remained as they were. In other words, 
commodities were subsidized and sold at less than their real 
cost. It was necessary to reconsider this policy of subsidies, 
the continuation of which would have emptied the state's coffers. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Some call for rationalizing public expenditures 
to curb government spending. 
  [Sidqi] There is no government overspending. Spending is 
being done within the narrowest limits. Government expenditures 
have been squeezed to the minimum. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What is your explanation of the discrepancy in 
the views of Egyptian officials regarding GATT? The ministers 
of economy, planning, and foreign affairs have different views 
on GATT. I ask: Why this discrepancy in views, given that the 
government has participated in the GATT negotiations over the 
past eight years? 
  [Sidqi] Yes, Egypt has participated in the GATT 
negotiations for eight years. I see no differences on GATT. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The foreign minister's statements look as if we 
have been surprised by GATT, as if it has been a shock to us, 
and as if it will negatively affect us as a developing country. 
  [Sidqi] I do not believe this has happened. It is true that 
some statements have given this impression. What I say is that 
GATT has good privileges for the developing countries. At the 
same time it has some negative effects. Every official looks at 
the subject from a different angle. This in itself is a healthy 
phenomenon and not a discrepancy. It is not correct to say GATT 
is all good or all bad. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But is it more negative or positive? 
  [Sidqi] GATT will definitely affect us in the short run, but 
not in the medium or long run because the state opted to be part 
of the world economy. Therefore, we must respect and observe 
international systems. Anyway, GATT will not remain GATT; as of 
1 January 1995, it will be named the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). The GATT that will be signed in the next few weeks will 
liberate foreign trade throughout the world. This means GATT 
will cover not only commodity trade, but also trade in services, 
copyrights, and patent rights. The last two are new to Egypt, 
and perhaps they are more worrying than commodity trade. 
  The new system will therefore have a much wider scope than 
that of GATT, which covers only commodity exchange. I am not 
worried, although I have to take several precautions in the 
short run. Why am I not worried? Because our policy of 
liberating the national economy largely conforms with the new 
trends in the organization of international trade. 
  [Al-Sa'id] How long can our products stand fast in the face 
of foreign competition? 
  [Sidqi] GATT will give our products new opportunities. Talk 
about positive or negative impacts is linked to our ability to 
compete and improve our production. As a developing country, 
therefore, we must work to increase our ability to compete. We 
are able to have good and competitive products. 
  [Al-Sa'id] When the unified tax bill was discussed in the 
People's Assembly, you were criticized for threatening to resign 
if the bill was not approved. 
  [Sidqi] I did not threaten to resign. I only said that if 
the bill was not passed, we would withdraw it. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Does this not mean the confiscation of democracy? 
The bill should have been given enough time for discussion. 
  [Sidqi] The unified tax bill took more time for discussion 
than any other bill. Indeed, the bill itself is not new. The 
bill was issued in 1978 upon the People's Assembly's 
recommendation; it was then called the tax justice law. In 1980, 
I chaired a committee to work out the bill on the basis of a 
unified tax. Several years later, I presented the bill to the 
finance minister, and it was similar to the current unified tax 
bill. In 1986, we also discussed the possibility of its 
implementation. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Does this mean that you are committed to the 
bill? 
  [Sidqi] The bill is one of the fairer and best laws, but 
regrettably some people regarded it from the beginning as 
additional taxation, which is not true. We intended the bill to 
include and incorporate all taxes and general revenue in one 
tax, and the law is fair and takes low incomes into 
consideration. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But the bill's exemption limit is not 
satisfactory. 
  [Sidqi] This is just a social expression and there are many 
other countries that do not offer exemption on family burdens. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But what about the talk that it was the United 
States that drafted the bill and that it was imposed on you by 
international financial institutions? 
  [Sidqi] This is baseless because the law is 100 percent 
Egyptian. We embarked on it a long time ago and it has nothing 
to do with the United States. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about the Middle East market, for the idea 
and feasibility of which you formed a committee of many 
ministers? What are your conclusions? 
  [Sidqi] We are examining not the Middle East market but the 
current circumstances that resulted from recent political 
developments in the region. These are the Palestinians and the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, Jordan and the understanding about a 
declaration of principles, and Syria, which is on its way to 
reaching an understanding. All this will have gigantic effects 
on the region in all aspects, particularly in the economic 
sphere. 
  Therefore, the committee was set up to follow these 
developments and measure their effects on all aspects, 
especially on the economic side. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What is your own view on the Middle East market 
and on the possibility of including Arab countries in it? 
  [Sidqi] Like it or not, we are bound to adjust to new 
circumstances and we cannot distance ourselves from them because 
they are a reality. Failure to deal with reality is a grave 
mistake. We must adapt to reality and adjust our economy and 
ties to be in line with this fact. Today we cannot exclude 
certain facts; Israel exists and we must normalize ties with it 
as much as possible. Large world economic groups exist--NAFTA, 
Southeast Asia, and the European Union. We also must go in the 
same direction. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Concerning foreign policy, what are the main 
lines 
of Egypt's foreign policy? 
  [Sidqi] Two main lines are peace and development and they 
are 
integrated. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about our relations with other countries? 
  [Sidqi] Our relations are excellent with all world 
countries, 
except a country or two, and this is no problem. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What is your assessment of the U.S. role in the 
region? 
  [Sidqi] We cannot deny that the United States has become the 
sole superpower in the world following the collapse of the 
Soviet Union. Therefore, it would be illogical on my part to 
deal with the region and the world without realizing or taking 
this new situation into account. The United States is now the 
sole superpower. It has influence all over the world. It is 
playing a role in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and 
Africa. I must have full and good relations with it. Thank 
God, our relations with the United States are very good. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Can the United States put pressure on you to 
adopt certain policies toward regional problems? 
  [Sidqi] No one puts pressure on us. Our decisions emanate 
from our willpower and not the willpower of others. We depend 
on ourselves in making decisions that do not antagonize the 
world. The pivots of our policy are peace and development. I 
believe peace was rejuvenated in the region only when the United 
States showed interest in it. It is true that the superpowers 
were represented in the past by the Soviet Union and the United 
States. The situation has changed after the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, which drowned in its own problems. The only 
superpower in the world now is the United States. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Some say that the Gaza-Jericho agreement is in 
the intensive care unit. 
  [Sidqi] We view the agreement as a step toward a 
comprehensive, permanent, and just peace in the Middle East. It 
is a step on the road to peace. We hope that the gap between 
the Palestinians and Israel will be bridged in a way that will 
lead to the honest and accurate implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles signed in Washington in September. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But Israel does not want to implement the 
agreement honestly and accurately. 
  [Sidqi] The negotiator always keeps some "cards" to himself. 
However, if Israel wants to live in the region, it must 
normalize relations with its neighbors in general and the 
Palestinians in particular. It is in the interest of all 
parties for peace to prevail in the Middle East. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Israel deliberately speaks about unilateral deals 
with one party without the other and looks forward to measures 
that primarily safeguard its security without caring about the 
security of the Arab parties. 
  [Sidqi] Let it be known that the basis of any peace is the 
return of the Arab territories Israel occupied in 1967 to their 
owners. This has been acknowledged by the international 
community in an almost unanimous manner. I believe UN Security 
Council Resolutions 242 and 338 are the starting and reference 
points. Since the peace conference began in Madrid in October 
1991--and even the efforts that preceded it--these two 
resolutions have been the cornerstone of any just and 
comprehensive settlement in the region. Resolution 242 is clear 
regarding the need for the exchange of land for peace and the 
inadmissibility of the seizure of the land of others by force. 
President Clinton affirmed this during the Geneva summit with 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. Clinton affirmed his 
determination to establish a comprehensive and just peace in the 
region. 
  [Al-Sa'id] How do you evaluate the al-Asad-Clinton summit 
in Geneva on 16 January? 
  [Sidqi] It was undoubtedly a tremendous step that gave 
impetus to the peace process. It also helped clarify positions. 
The statements to journalists by Presidents Clinton and al-Asad 
showed clearly that the summit produced positive results. But 
these could not appear overnight. We will see these results 
gradually in light of the current Arab-Israeli talks in 
Washington. The results of the Geneva summit will affect all 
negotiating tracks. The results of the meetings between Yasir 
'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin must also affect the Arab-Israeli 
talks. 
  [Al-Sa'id] How emphatically can we say that this year can 
bring peace to the Middle East and to the domestic front? 
  [Sidqi] Domestic peace, praise be to God, is at hand. The 
incidents that take place in the country are only individual 
ones. I stress this although I myself could have been one of the 
victims, but I am not really worried because of these incidents. 
  I believe that before the year ends, God willing, we will 
have put things on their right course. The state's arm is 
strong and able to eradicate terrorism. 
  As regards peace in the Middle East, I say that this year, 
God willing, will usher in a new era toward the achievement of a 
just and comprehensive peace and the attainment of the full 
rights of the Palestinians, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Each 
party must be given its rights. Arab territory will return to 
its rightful owners. Neither Israel nor any other country in the 
region can live in peace and stability unless all pending issues 
concerning Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians are 
resolved on the basis of a land- for-peace exchange. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Do you not feel annoyed with the persistent 
criticism of government policies in daily press caricatures? 
Does this not indicate a loss of government prestige? 
  [Sidqi] This never annoys me. I only feel annoyed when 
people are harmed as individuals. Criticizing policies is no 
problem; different views do not disturb cordial relations. One 
feels annoyed when comics or jokes harm people as individual 
persons with independent entities, values, and beliefs. A 
slanderous caricature may disturb one for an hour or two, but 
not more; one has no time to be annoyed day and night. 
Political criticism is acceptable any time and from any person, 
whether a government or an opposition reporter. I absolutely do 
not feel hurt.
