  [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has admitted 
that Syria is serious about the establishment of peace and that 
it has always honored its commitments and obligations. 
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres cast doubts 
about the possibility of achieving a true breakthrough on the 
Syrian-Israeli track because, as he put it, the Syrian ice has 
not yet thawed. In fact, Peres and other Israeli officials are 
making contradictory statements every day and deliberately 
casting doubt about Syria's peaceful intentions. 
  The Geneva summit, which has given strong momentum to the 
peace process and, according to Peres himself, breathed new life 
into the peace process, has proved Syria's credibility to the 
entire world. This is demonstrated by the fact that all U.S. 
officials, led by President Clinton and Secretary of State 
Christopher, have praised Syria's positive and constructive 
stand and its determined effort to build a just, comprehensive 
Middle East peace. This is also demonstrated by the fact the 
entire international community has praised President Hafiz 
al-Asad's genuine interest in peace and his call to establish 
the peace of the brave in the region. Such a peace requires 
Israel to rise to the level of the aspirations of the region and 
the world. 
  Syria agreed to hold the current talks in Washington in 
appreciation of the U.S. role and in the hope that Israel will 
change its previous policies, put an end to the policy of 
intransigence and maneuvering, and respond to the UN security 
Council resolutions regulating the peace process. Right from 
the first session, the head of the Israeli delegation to 
Washington said the talks were held in a businesslike 
atmosphere. However, the Israeli officials soon tarnished this 
positivity with their negative statements. Following an Israeli 
request, it was agreed to hold the Washington talks away from 
the media. This is understandable, since it is known that the 
Israeli rulers call for secret negotiations. However, Israeli 
officials are making statements daily that cast doubt on the 
Washington talks. 
  Insisting on playing the same tune, Israeli officials still 
demand a definition of the nature of peace, despite tha fact 
that the Geneva summit clearly specified the nature of peace and 
stressed Syria's readiness to implement all requirements of a 
just, comprehensive regional peace. 
  However, definitely running amid noise and clamor and 
deliberately raising doubts in all directions, Israeli officials 
want a separate deal that is closer to a spectacle than to a 
peace, such as the Oslo agreement. Brought about by secret 
talks, the Oslo agreement has faced, and its still facing, 
obstacles. 
  If there is any positivity in the current Washington talks, 
then it is definitely the result of the positive Syrian 
position, not the Israeli position, which has not yet rid itself 
of the policy of maneuvering and procrastination. Syria has 
expressly declared its readiness to establish a just, 
comprehensive peace in the region and to abide by all its 
requirements. But has Israel declared its readiness to enforce 
UN Security Council resolutions and to fully withdraw from the 
Golan Heights? Syria is still awaiting the answer. 
  If there is any ice, then it is definitely on the Israeli 
side, rather than on the Syrian side. If Rabin admits that 
Syria is serious about the establishment of peace, what prevents 
Israel, knowing that the ball is now at its court, from 
declaring commitment to full withdrawal, instead of casting 
doubt, raising its endless security fears, and threatening to 
hold a referendum on the Golan and peace with Syria? 
  At this point, we recall statements by Rabin and other 
Israeli officials that Israel will not declare readiness to 
withdraw from the Golan before Syria defines the nature of 
peace. The Geneva summit defined the nature of peace. The 
world is still awaiting a statement by Israel on its readiness 
for full withdrawal. 
  Peace in the region is a matter of occupied territories and 
usurped rights. Consequently, peace requires an end to 
occupation and the restoration of land and rights. Unless it is 
just and comprehensive, peace in the region stands no chance of 
lasting. Certainly, peace is not separate deals made behind the 
scenes, evading the hopes and aspirations of the region's 
countries. Peace cannot mean capitulation to Israel and an 
acknowledgement of the legitimacy of its occupation and 
settlements. 
  Syria will always adhere to a just, comprehensive peace. It 
will never budge from this stand. No one in the world will 
blame Syria for this brave stand. Nay, the world supports 
Syria's quest for a just, comprehensive peace, especially since 
the world has seen the failures of separate deals. Undoubtedly, 
the world is expecting Israel to adopt the long-awaited positive 
stand.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Israeli Defiance," TISHRIN 
says: When the Israelis do not wish to understand, they exhibit 
an amazing ability to defy all facts. Thus, they are dealing 
with the outside world as if it is blind, deaf, and mute. In an 
interview with CNN, the Israeli prime minister said he did not 
directly or indirectly hear that Syria is prepared for full 
peace, adding that he knows, however, what Syria wants from 
Israel in return for peace. 
  TISHRIN continues: Although Syria never conceals its resolve 
to restore the occupied Golan, it has for years stressed 
adherence to the establishment of a just, comprehensive Middle 
East peace. Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, 
Syria has renewed this assertion hundreds of times. The recent 
Geneva summit was one occasion when Syria clearly explained its 
concept of peace and its nature. It also voiced its readiness 
to honor all peace requirements. Moreover, through President 
al-Asad, Syria called for concluding the peace of the brave. It 
also urged the Israeli leaders to rise to the level of the cause 
of peace and to have the necessary courage to establish a just, 
comprehensive peace in the region and remove the Middle East 
from the cycle of war and conflicts. 
  TISHRIN continues: It sounds odd that while the entire world 
is convinced of Syria's credibility and honest quest for peace, 
praises its efforts and initiative, and values its stands, the 
Israeli rulers find no reason to be convinced. The paper notes 
Rabin's recent statement in which he said: We do not know what 
kind of peace will be agreed on, and to where we will pull out. 
The paper says: It must be reasserted that Syria is looking 
for a just, comprehensive peace; a durable, stable peace; a 
genuine peace that ends occupation and restores rights to their 
owners; a peace that is acceptable to the current Arab 
generations and worthy of being maintained by future 
generations. Such a peace must be honorable and must uproot 
injustice, oppression, and occupation. 
  TISHRIN explains that such a peace requires Israel's full 
withdrawal from the Golan. It says that Syria has frequently 
asserted that it will never bargain over an iota of the Golan 
soil nor will it relinquish an inch of it. Any compromise, 
which Israel wants, is absolutely out of question. The Golan 
Heights are Syrian and have been since time immemorial. They 
should be returned to the motherland and to their evacuated 
population, who are awaiting the establishment of peace to 
return to their homes. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace in the Middle East is no 
longer exclusively a Syrian or Arab issue. Rather, it is a 
world issue. The world will not allow that a unique peace 
opportunity be destroyed. Two years of Israeli intransigence 
have so far failed to destroy this opportunity.

  [Text] Gentlemen: The bilateral talks at the level of 
heads of delegations held in Washington since 24 January ended 
without any progress in the Middle East peace process. After 
two weeks of continued talks, Israel asked that these talks be 
suspended until 25 February. This shows the Israeli position is 
still the same in terms of intransigence, procrastination, and 
prevarication. It still adheres to all the obstacles 
threatening the peace process and continues to adopt proposals 
and ideas that will not achieve real, durable, and comprehensive 
peace. 
  This is revealed by Israeli assertions that issues have not 
reached fruition on the Israeli side and that circumstances are 
not yet conducive to achieving peace. No doubt, these flimsy 
pretexts conceal an Israeli attempt to sabotage the peace 
process, striking at its roots via a well-known policy of 
extending the period of talks and considering talks an end in 
themselves. 
  These Israeli efforts cannot be separated from practices 
designed to obstruct the peace process and to lay traps in its 
path. This is revealed by the Israeli Government's decision to 
expand two settlements in the Golan and to allow settlers to 
carry out this expansion with government support and 
sponsorship. No other evidence is needed that Israel does not 
want peace. These practices and positions all show, either 
directly or through impressions and maneuvering, that Israel 
still refuses to respond to the requirements of a just and 
comprehensive peace. Israel is hostile to the resolutions of 
international legitimacy that demand its withdrawal from 
occupied Arab territories. Israel is being hostile to peace and 
is contradicting it. Even in its separate deal known as the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, Israel is still procrastinating, 
prevaricating, and avoiding implementation. 
  Furthermore, the secret Oslo deal is still blocked, facing 
Israeli obstacles. Events and developments prove the Israeli 
plans cannot lead to the desired peace--a peace that secures the 
region's security and stability. 
  Hence, we believe that the Israeli positions and practices 
threaten not just the peace process, but also place the region 
in a state of continued disturbance and tension and spread an 
atmosphere of pessimism and darkness. Israel alone is 
responsible for this disturbed and worrying situation. It is 
responsible for the possible consequences of such a situation in 
terms of complications and reactions. This is because Israel's 
waste of the available peace opportunities has not been a 
coincidence. Each time, this has happened after careful 
considerations and planning. This is reaffirmed by Israel's 
refusal, inside and outside the talks, to speak about a full 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and by its refusal 
to stop settlement activities which are a manifestation of the 
occupation. This is also reaffirmed by Israel's refusal to 
comply with the basics and formula of the Madrid conference and 
by its disavowal of the principle of restoring the land in 
return for peace. 
  The continued Israeli rejection of all this is a rejection 
of 
peace and its requirements and of the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. This is because whoever is concerned 
about peace does not prevaricate, procrastinate, or deceive.

  [Text] Gentlemen: The Israeli Government has endorsed the 
agriculture minister's plan to expand two settlements in 
occupied Syrian Golan by adding new housing complexes to sites 
in these two settlements on the pretext that this is necessary 
in order to promote Israeli security. The Israeli measure was 
taken as the Washington bilateral talks were under way at the 
chief delegates' level to make progress in the peace process, 
and as the international community was waiting for an Israeli 
response that would promote the cause of peace, one that would 
be commensurate with the hopes and aspirations created by the 
Geneva summit, to end the vicious cycle of wars and strife in 
the Middle East. 
  As a matter of fact, since the end of the Geneva summit, 
Israeli officials have been questioning the possible achievement 
of peace with Syria. They have been casting dark shadows on the 
outcome of the summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill 
Clinton, particularly since the summit has consecrated Syria's 
basic and key role in the peace process and underscored the need 
to implement the relevant UN Security Council resolutions to 
achieve just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  Israeli officials have admitted that the Washington talks 
produced satisfactory answers to their security concerns. 
Nonetheless, the Israeli negotiating team has failed to declare 
an Israeli commitment to complete withdrawal from the Golan. 
Instead, they suspended the negotiations for 10 days for 
consultations with their government. Meanwhile, the Arab 
delegations remained in Washington, awaiting the return of the 
Israeli teams with the required answers. 
  Could the decision to expand the two settlements in the 
occupied Golan be an indirect response to Syria's true and 
honest endeavors to establish a durable, just, and true peace in 
the Middle East? Observers are bound to say that the answer to 
this question is in the affirmative, especially since Israeli 
officials have, for some time, been attempting to belittle 
Syria's role in the peace process. They have cast doubts on the 
usefulness of the Geneva summit and Syria's intentions, as well. 
Worse still, they have also floated the idea of holding a 
referendum on the future of the Golan--something which has taken 
international quarters by surprise. Since its inception, Israel 
has never held referendums. Its laws do not authorize 
referendums. The Knesset has to pass a new law authorizing 
referendums. Moreover, the Golan is occupied Syrian territory. 
All relevant UN Security Council resolutions acknowledge its 
Syrian identity and the need for it to be returned to Syrian 
sovereignty. Consequently, any referendum that could be held on 
the future of the Golan is worthless, because it would be a 
serious violation of international law. Moreover, it would be a 
serious precedent in international relations. The Golan is at 
the heart of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. Without Syria, 
there is no hope for peace in the Middle East. 
  All these indicators, coupled with settlement activities in 
the Golan, clearly show that Israel is opposed to peace, that it 
has continued to pursue a policy based on evasion and 
procrastination in the Washington talks, and that its previous 
discourse on the kind of peace Syria is offering in exchange for 
withdrawal was part of a scheme of maneuvering and deception. 
  The Geneva summit delineated the kind of peace we are 
offering. But, this move on our part has resulted in an Israeli 
decision to expand settlements in the Golan, aggravated 
suspicion, and the failure on Israel's part to commit itself to 
complete withdrawal. Worse still, Israel has continued to drag 
its feet and renewed its talk about the strategic value of the 
occupied Golan and Israel's security concerns. If Israel had 
actually been seeking peace, it would have deemed the Arab 
negotiators' presence in Washington and the talks they held with 
its negotiators there sufficient proof of their peaceful 
intentions as well as a strong motivation for peacemaking. 
  After all, Arabs have been engaged in negotiations for the 
past two years. Syria submitted a working paper to the Israeli 
negotiators during the sixth round of the bilateral talks. This 
paper enjoyed the appreciation of the international community 
and captured its attention. Syria has also helped salvage the 
peace process from several impasses created by Israel. 
  In the face of these sincere intentions and these 
unmistakable efforts to establish a just and comprehensive peace 
in the Middle East, Israel has chosen to persist with its 
maneuvering and provocation. Settlement expansion is a clear 
provocation to Syria. The failure on Israel's part to declare a 
commitment to withdrawal from the Golan is a flagrant and 
blatant evasion. However, all this will not undermine Syria's 
position in the least, nor will it shake its commitment to just 
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East--the peace that will 
result in the dismantlement of the occupation and the return of 
all the Golan, as well as the other occupied Arab territories. 
Israel alone will be responsible for scuttling a unique 
opportunity to reach a just and honorable solution that could 
crown with success U.S. and international peace efforts.

  [Text] Gentlemen: Israel, once again, has used the 
pretext of Lebanese resistance to launch large-scale aggression 
against south Lebanon and inflict heavy damage on installations 
and property. Once again, it sought to lay the blame at the 
doorstep of the Lebanese and Syrian Governments, when only the 
occupation -- the one huge obstacle hampering Middle East 
peacemaking efforts -- can be held responsible. 
  For more than two years now, in the context of the Madrid 
conference and the Washington talks, Syria and Lebanon have been 
unsuccessfully attempting to convince Israel to adhere to UN 
Security Council resolutions relevant to the peace process. To 
date, Israel refused to be bound by full withdrawal from the 
Golan, and raises an endless string of security concerns to hide 
its shifty expansionist policies. On the Lebanese front, its 
behavior has not been any different. Syria and Lebanon now find 
themselves faced with negotiations in which Israel wants to 
focus solely on security issues. Peace is what the negotiations 
should be about -- the kind of peace under which the occupied 
territory is liberated. The impossible security terms set by 
Israel substantially compromise Syria's sovereignty over the 
Golan and Lebanon's sovereignty over southern Lebanon. Their 
demands also entrench the occupation in various ways and remain 
completely at odds with relevant UN Security Council resolutions 
and the land-for-peace formula. 
  Contrary to all international norms, Israel deems it 
permissible to commit aggression on neighboring Arab states, 
appropriating territory in one place and raising security 
concerns in another. In either case, the bottom line is one and 
the same -- and that is expansionism. The Israelis use security 
as a pretext to justify expansion, when, in reality, they are 
the aggressors whose aircraft bomb Lebanese towns and villages 
and it is their artillery that shells Lebanese civilians and 
drives them from their homes. It is Israel that has been piling 
up weapons, holding an arsenal bursting at the seams with all 
types of conventional and unconventional arms. On the other 
hand, the Arab states have, since 1948, been on the receiving 
end of Israel's recurrent acts of aggression. It is the Arabs, 
therefore, that can advance a better case for security 
guarantees. It is Arab territory that is under occupation, and 
it is Arab civilians who are targeted by Israel's savage raids. 
  Typically, however, Israel turns things upside down and 
falsifies facts. Instead of pursuing peace as the true 
guarantee of security for the region's states, Israel is 
pursuing expansion and aggression. It is an established fact 
that occupation triggers resistance, that the practices of 
occupation only intensify resistance, and that peace will remain 
elusive until occupation ends and rights are recognized. 
  The United States has accepted the fact that the Syrian and 
Lebanese tracks at the Washington talks complement each other. 
Plainly speaking, this means that Middle East peace is 
contingent upon Israel vacating the Golan Heights and south 
Lebanon. The Syrian and Lebanese Governments have made it 
abundantly clear that there will be no ceding of a single inch 
of the occupied Syrian or Lebanese territory. They have made it 
equally clear that they will never set any store by Israeli 
blackmailing tactics. 
  If Syria and Lebanon have held out hopes for this latest 
round of the Washington talks, this is because the United States 
has given an unambiguous commitment to a just and lasting 
settlement, grounded in UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 
338, and 425, on all fronts of the conflict. To date, however, 
equivocation continues to be the bedrock of Israel's policies. 
Israel couples its equivocation with the strong-arm tactics it 
is now applying in south Lebanon. However, this foolish policy 
proved ineffectual in the past and is hardly likely to succeed 
now or in the future. Peace and stability in the region will 
remain dependent upon a total Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories.

  [Text] Kathmandu, Feb 9 (AFP) -- The governing Nepali 
Congress party president has been defeated in a Kathmandu 
by-election, while the party's candidate emerged victorious in 
Jhapa, officials said Wednesday. 
  The Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist 
(NCP-UML) candidate Bidhya Bhandari received 43,319 votes 
against ruling party president Krishna Prasad Bhattarai's 41,490 
votes, bagging the coveted seat in the Nepalese lower house of 
parliament by the 1,829 votes. 
  The rightist National Democratic Party (NDP) candidate, Jog 
Mehar Shrestha gained 7,537 votes. 
  It was the third election defeat of Bhattarai's 50-year 
political career, a Nepali Congress party source said. 
  Bidhya Bhandari is the widow of former NCP-UML general 
secretary and parliamentarian, Madan Kumar Bhandari, who was 
killed in a jeep accident last May. 
  The by-elections, held under heavy security Monday in 
Kathmandu and Jhapa districts, were held to fill two seats in 
the lower house of parliament left vacant last year by the 
deaths of two communist parliamentarians. 
  In Jhapa, 390 kilometres, (243 miles) southeast of here, the 
Nepali Congress candidate, Krishna Prasad Shitaula won the seat 
with 16,194 votes. 
  Shitaula's closest rival, NCP-UML's Lila Udashi Khanal, 
polled 13,337 votes. National Democratic Party (NDP) candidate, 
Gopal Chandra Rajbanshi received 8,251 votes. 
  Political observers and student activists blame Prime 
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala for the defeat of party president 
Bhattarai. Had Koirala supported his party colleague during 
campaigning he might have won, they charged. 
  If Bhattarai had won the election, he would have become a 
viable alternative should Koirala resign from office. 
  Bhattarai's defeat could lead to a split in the country's 
largest democratic party. 
  At a time when opposition parties are demanding Koirala's 
resignation over his poor economic performance and inability to 
maintain law and order, a Bhattarai victory would have put 
Koirala in a very difficult position, a highly placed Nepali 
Congress party source said. 
  Altogether 24 candidates contested the election in 
Kathmandu, 
while in Jhapa, nine candidates filed their nomination papers. 
  The victors will serve a two and a half year term in the 
lower house.

  [Text] Kathmandu, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Several hundred 
pro-democracy students Tuesday demonstrated against Nepal's 
prime minister for allegedly deceiving the ruling Nepali 
Congress [NC] contender in the by-elections, witnesses said. 
  Nearly 10,000 pro-democracy Nepal Students Union (NSU) 
members gathered at the eastern corner of the city hall, where 
the by- elections' vote counting was in progress. 
  The students shouted slogans against Nepalese Prime Minister 
Girija Prasad Koirala, such as "Down with disruptionist 
Koirala," and "Down with pro-India Koirala." 
  The students bitterly criticized Koirala for his "unhelpful 
attitude" towards the Nepali Congress party president and 
candidate, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, in Kathmandu during his 
campaign for the by-elections on Monday. 
  The by-elections, held in Kathmandu and Jhapa districts 
under 
heavy security, were to fill two seats in the lower house of 
parliament left vacant last year by the deaths of two communist 
parliamentarians. 
  After raising anti-Koirala slogans for several hours at a 
street corner in Kathmandu, several hundred of them headed 
towards the prime minister's official residence in a procession. 
  Riot police followed the angry students' procession but did 
not stop them, the witnesses added. 
  The students said the prime minister's bitter remarks last 
week, broadcast over radio and television, against Bhattarai for 
his anti-government remarks during his campaign had badly 
affected the NC contender. 
  They said Koirala's criticism had played a negative role 
that 
led people to vote for Bhattarai's opposition. 
  Meanwhile, the country's main opposition party candidate in 
Kathmandu is leading in the vote counts, the state radio 
announced. 
  The announcement said the Nepal Communist Party-United 
Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) candidate Bidhya Bhandari was 
leading in Kathmandu late Tuesday by over 6,000 votes against 
her ruling Nepali Congress party rival, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai. 
  But in Jhapa, 390 kilometres (243 miles) southeast of here, 
the Nepali Congress candidate, Krishna Prasad Shitaula, was 
leading over his NCP-UML contender, Lila Udashi Khanal, by over 
1,000 votes. 
  Final results are expected to be announced Wednesday noon. 
  Election Commission officials said that in Kathmandu

<F P=106> [Editorial: "India's Perturbation"] </F>
  [Text] The far-reaching and effective steps taken by 
Pakistan on the Kashmir issue to consolidate world public 
opinion and exert pressure on India has perturbed it, which was 
reflected in the speech made by President Shankara Dayal Sharma 
at Jaipur. He made Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto the target of 
his criticism and used very harsh words. He said: Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto is turning away from realities. She has forgotton the 
atrocities committed on her own people and has lost touch with 
the culture of the subcontinent. She has also ignored the 
virtues of benevolence of Pakistan and India as well as of all 
religions. Otherwise, she would not have ordered the police to 
open fire on her own mother, brother, and kith and kin, who had 
gathered to pay homage to her father, the late prime minister, 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. 
  Shankar Dayal Sharma deserves respect for being the 
president 
of India and because of his diplomatic stature. But, he did not 
maintain the dignity of his post nor did he fulfill the demands 
of diplomtic norms. There is no justification for him making 
the person of Benazir Bhutto the target of his criticism. 
Benazir Bhutto and the Government of Pakistan have expressed 
solidarity with the people of Kashmir. They raised their voices 
of protest against the Indian occupation forces for perpetrating 
atrocities on Kashmiris and also informed world public opinion 
of the calamities and hardships befalling the Kashmiris. Do not 
the heart-rending facts produced by all neutral international 
organizations, human rights organizations, and mass media on the 
human rights violations in occupied Kashmir bear testimony to 
India's belligerant stand and its oppression of the Kashmiris? 
What did the Indian president unravel by referring to the 5 
January incident in Larkana wherein only one person was killed? 
All the newspapers in Pakistan carried full details of the 
incident. The occurrence of the incident as well as the motives 
behind it do not remain hidden in any quarters. Can the Indian 
president cover up the massacres of thousands of Kashmiri men, 
women, and children? Can he deny the burning up of scores and 
hundreds of houses there? Obviously, he cannot do so. Is it the 
culture of the subcontinent to sidetrack from the pledges made 
at the time of the adoption of the UN resolutions to implement 
them? Is the forcible occupation of any region against the will 
of its people tantamount to the observance of the ideals of 
goodwill? For the information of the president, the Larkana 
incident, wherein only one life was lost, was the outcome of the 
clash between two groups of people. Neither the government nor 
the local administration has anything to do with it. Indian 
atrocities in occupied Kashmir are being discussed in all the 
world fora. What a terrible and abominable culture is it 
wherein Indian troops are committing excesses on the defenseless 
people of occupied Kashmir and are crushing their bodies, lives, 
and their human rights as well!

  [Text] Kamra -- Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto will hand 
over the first Pak-rebuilt F-7P Fighter Interceptor Aircraft to 
the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) today in a roll-out ceremony at the 
Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC). 
  On arrival, the Prime Minister will be received by Air Chief 
Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan. The Prime Minister will also take a 
round of the PAC and inspect the overhaul and engineering 
facilities there. 
  F-7P, a Chinese aircraft, is the larest addition to PAF's 
inventory. The ceremony will herald a new era of technological 
advancement and technical cooperation between Pakistan and China. 
  F-7P is a Chinese-built version of Soviet MIG-21. Its basic 
capabilities have been enhanced with improved fire control and 
avionics systems to meet specific PAF sources. 
  F-7P aircraft has been inducted into PAF to augment its 
fleet 
of interceptor aircraft against threats of adversaries. 
  The F-7 Rebuild Factory was established in 1972. It rolled 
out its first F-6 fighter in 1981, while its trainer version 
FT-6 was rebuilt in 1985. Later on, its capability was enhanced 
to rebuild FT-5 in 1987 and A-5III in 1988. The factory is now 
rebuilding all Chinese origin aircraft on PAF's inventory. 
  This is also the first time that the aircraft rebuilding has 
been taken up in the country. This has not only reduced the 
burden on economy but also increased the technical maturity of 
the work force. 
  The F-6 Rebuild Factory, which is also rebuilding the F-7s, 
has successfully rebuilt more than 294 Chinese origin aircraft 
of various types for the PAF since its establishment. It also 
makes some 10,000 aparts of F-6s, FT-6s, FT-5s and A-5IIIs for 
maintenance of these aircraft. 
  The factory has also produced 500 and 800 line supersonic 
auxiliary tanks for the F-7s. They are in addition to the 1,140 
line auxiliary tanks which the factory has already made for the 
F- 6s. These tanks are installed externally to increase the 
endurance and range of the aircraft. 
  The first F-7P was taken up for overhaul by the factory in 
April, 1993. The basic infrastructure for the overhaul was 
already available and only a few additions for the overhaul of 
F-7 have been made. 
  The PAC comprises F-6 Rebuild Factory, Mirage Rebuild 
Factory, Aircraft Manufacturing Factory and Kamra Avionics and 
Radar Factory. 
  The Mirage Rebuild Factory is actively engaged in rebuilding 
the French Mirage aircraft and overhauling Praff &amp; Whitney 
F-100-200 engines for the F-16s. 
  More than 25 of the ex-Australian Mirages which PAF acquired 
in what may be called as "the deal of the decade" have also been 
produced by this factory. The Aircraft Manufacturing Factory is 
engaged in co-production of Karakoram-8 Aircraft with Chinese 
collaboration, apart from manufacturing the MFI-17 (Mushshak) 
aircraft of Swedish origin. Though not too old, the Kamra 
Avionics and Radar Factory is presently rebuilding ground radars 
for the PAF.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said her 
government is committed to self-reliance and indigenization of 
defense production to break the shackles of dependence. She was 
speaking at the roll-out ceremony of the first Pakistani rebuilt 
F- 7P aircraft in the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex [PAC] at 
Kamra today. The prime minister said: 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] Self-reliance is the key to 
national security, especially in the field of defense 
technology. However, we cannot increase our self-reliance, 
particularly in the field of defense technology unless we 
develop the scientific potential amongst the people of our 
country. And, that is one of the objectives of this government 
to encourage people to go into science and into the higher 
elements of scientific study. Yesterday, the cabinet took a 
decision that every [word indistinct] or every top scientists 
who does a Ph.D in this country will be given an additional 
stipend for one year to encourage the young people of our 
country to choose the scientific field to develop the full 
scientific potential of this country. The people's government 
is committed both to self-reliance and to the indigenization of 
defense production to break the shackles of dependence -- a 
dependence that has cost us truly in the past wars. History 
teaches us that nations who depend on others to fortify their 
defense. [sentence as heard] We consider the defense of our 
homeland the foremost policy. Last time as prime minister of 
the people's government, I authorized this F-7P overhaul project 
at PAC, Kamra, in December 1989. Therefore, it is a special 
privilege for me to come here and witness the completion of this 
project. [end recording] 
  The prime minister said let us pray to almighty Allah that 
he 
may grant us the strength and wisdom to make our nation 
self-reliance and strong for the safety and well-being of our 
people. Acknowledging the skill of engineers and technicians of 
F-7P rebuilt factory, she said: 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] A nation is great not only because 
of machines, a nation is great because of the talented men and 
women who give of their best. History is the story of human 
success. There is no doubt that the foundations of an aviation 
industry in Pakistan has now been laid. Our achievements over 
two decades bear the testimony to this fact. [end recording] 
  Addressing the ceremony, Defense Minister Aftab Shaban 
Mirani 
assured that the government is carefully monitoring the 
strategic plans in the region and is fully alive to the defense 
needs of the country. He said the government is favorably 
inclined to the indigenous development of defense products and 
the private sector is welcomed in this field. 
  The director general of Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Air 
Marshal Dilawar Hussain, in his welcome address said that trial 
rebuilt phase comprises overhaul of three aircraft -- one 
rolling out today, the second to be overhauled by the end of 
this month and the third in April this year. 
  Later, Ms. Benazir Bhutto witnessed static display of F-7P 
aircraft. She formally handed over the aircraft to Pakistan Air 
Force. F-7P is the battle-honored aircraft with high 
maneuverability in air combat. The aircraft in its modified and 
improved version is a potent weapon system with modern avionic 
fire control system and multifarious load carrying capability to 
fulfill intercept and attack role.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The New U.S. Condition for Economic and </F>
Military Aid"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Administration has hinted that restrictions 
on economic and military aid to all nonnuclear states will be 
maintained even if the Pressler Amendment is abolished. A 
discussion paper addressed to congressmen said that the U.S. 
Government will make economic and military assistance 
conditional to freezing, rolling back, and eventual destruction 
of the nuclear program. It has been clarified to Pakistan also 
that freezing the nuclear program will not be enough. The 
program will have be rolled back if it wants to receive the aid 
which is now lying in the pipeline. 
  Pakistan should not foster any optimism after the clear 
indication by the U.S. Administration because the United States 
is not even satisfied with our present position and it wants a 
total scrapping of the nuclear program. Given this situation, 
Pakistan is left with no alternative but to achieve 
self-sufficiency in arms production and to try to become a 
self-reliant country to get rid of economic aid and loans. The 
government should pay immediate attention to making basic 
changes in the nation's economic structure and policies so that 
the objective can be achieved. It should give top priority to 
reliance on domestic resources, checking waste, increasing 
national production, and especially to developing Pakistan's 
relations with the economic bloc of Islamic countries. 
  It is encouraging that Pakistani scientists and engineers 
have begun work on attaining the capability to design and set up 
nuclear power plants. It will at least help overcome the 
country's power crisis, thereby accelerating the pace of 
industrial development. Since India has already become a nuclear 
power, it will not be affected by the U.S. restrictions. 
Furthermore, the United States is also giving preferential 
treatment to India. Pakistan has refused to accept any 
unilateral U.S. restrictions. 
  After the U.S. Administration's latest decision, Pakistan 
should now depend on its own resources to meet its defense and 
economic requirements instead of seeking help from the United 
States. We can fully overcome this trial if we can master the 
subject of efficient planning and rely on our own resources. We 
should never think of renouncing the nuclear technology which we 
acquired with our own labor, talent, and resources because it is 
a matter of protecting our sovereignty and independence. Any 
compromise on it will be tantamount to national suicide.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Pressler snag"] </F>
  [Text] The Pakistan specific Pressler Amendment, ostensibly 
aimed at curbing Pakistan's nuclear designs, has been 
reincorporated in the revised draft of the Foreign Assistance 
Act submitted to US Congress last week by the Clinton 
Administration. The discussion draft submitted on 22 November 
1993 had sought to repeal the amendment taking the view that all 
country specific amendments must be done away with. However, it 
was obvious, given he significance of the nuclear issue within 
the South Asian context, that Pressler would witness the 
fiercest battle between the Administration and the Congress. 
Senator Larry Pressler had them vowed to fight tooth and nail 
for the inclusion of his amendment. It appears now that he did. 
Analysts, both in Pakistan and abroad had built scenarios, 
linking Administration's attempts at shooting down the amendment 
as reciprocating Islamabad's tacit approval of toeing the 
international line on Kashmir. It was thought at the time that 
Washington was posturing to indicate to India its 
dissatisfaction with the human rights violations as also the 
dated Indian rhetoric of Kashmir being its atoot ang [integral 
part]. Ms. Robin Raphel's visit and her statements on the issue 
and Islamabad's decision to withdraw the resolution in the UN, 
condemning human rights violations by India in the valley, 
seemed to point to a nexus of sorts. The Administration on its 
part had given the general impression that Pressler had failed 
to advance Washington's objectives of non-proliferation, raising 
hopes that the amendment might be scrapped. The scenario has 
come apart. 
  While the Americans might see this development in the 
domestic context of a usual fight between the Administration and 
the Congress, the reincorporation of the amendment in the 
Foreign Assistance Act has different connotations for Pakistan. 
And this does not just include the man on the street, but 
virtually everyone. There may be a spate of concerned statements 
on Kashmir by Americans, Ms Raphel's being the latest, but it is 
obvious that when it comes to the crunch, it is always Pakistan 
that falls on hard times. The development also does not 
dovetail with the viewpoint of some American analysts who have 
been advising Washington to remain evenhanded in South Asia, 
especially in the military sphere. Simply put it means that the 
conventional strength of the Pakistani defence forces should at 
least be kept at a level where paranoid does not set in, forcing 
it to rely on nonconventional options in the face of growing 
imbalance of conventional forces vis-a-vis India. Now with the 
amendment still clamped on, the squeeze continues. While the 
ground forces could manage to scout for alternatives the air 
force, hardest hit by the amendment, is growing desperate. 
There is the question of the delivery of 71 F-16s for which 
Pakistan has already paid $658 million but which it cannot get 
because of the amendment. However, it has to keep paying the 
installments, another snag on which the two governments, 
according to one report, have been stumbling. While it would be 
optimistic to say that Islamabad could survive the amendment, 
even if the costs be high, the US response to the people of this 
country does not enhance its credibility in the eyes of most 
Pakistani. Given the present escalation of tension in the 
region on the question of Kashmir, the development could bode 
ill, forcing the saner element to concede ground to the hawks.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb 8 (AFP)--A radical Iranian newspaper on 
Tuesday questioned the official version of a failed bid to kill 
President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani last week. 
  A gunman fired several shots in the air as Rafsanjani 
addressed a gathering in the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeyni last Tuesday to mark the 15th anniversary of the 
Islamic revolution. 
  The official media reported that the 26-year-old gunman, 
Kurush Nik-Akhtar, fired bullets from a low-calibre colt pistol 
while standing 50 meters (yards) away from the podium. 
  "Why didn't the gunman try to get closer to the stand which 
was a simple thing to do?" the daily SALAM asked. "Why did he 
attempt to shoot from a distance where he knew he had no chance 
of hitting his target?" 
  The paper also demanded explanation on how the gunman had 
been able to pass through the shrine's security "on a day when 
so many foreign and domestic personalities were present." 
  The authorities initially played down the incident as a 
"childish affair", but later called it a "premeditated plot" 
aimed at undermining the Islamic republic. 
  Iranian Information Minister 'Ali Fallahian said Monday that 
more than 20 people had been arrested in connection with the 
shooting. They have all confessed to having "ominous and 
counter-revolutionary aims," he said.

<F P=106> [Unidentified commentary] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God. Greetings dear listeners. As 
you heard in the news bulletin, today, Hojjat ol-Eslam 
val-Moslemin Fallahian, the honorable minister of intelligence, 
revealed new aspects of the treacherous plot to assassinate the 
well-loved president of the Iranian nation. 
  Mr. Fallahian stressed that all those arrested have, during 
the preliminary interrogations, confessed to all their evil and 
counterrevolutionary aims and intentions. There is no doubt 
that the sworn enemies of the Islamic revolution are doing their 
utmost today to inflict blows on the glorious revolution of the 
Muslim nation of Iran. The assassination of well-loved 
prominent and pivotal personalities of the Islamic revolution 
has been the unchanging policy of the United States and its 
mercenary agents. 
  The victory of the Islamic revolution inflicted a heavy and 
fundamental blow to the interests of the United States and 
international Zionism and it was natural that, from the very 
start, these sworn enemies of the revolution would make the 
pivotal personalities and dignitaries of the revolution the 
targets of their conspiracies. 
  A review of the history of the Islamic revolution during the 
past 15 years reveals the personalities and dignitaries who were 
targeted by the enemy from the very beginning of the revolution. 
The assassination of the regime's dignitaries, whether in 
physical terms or in terms of propaganda, has been part and 
parcel of the general strategy of the enemies of the Islamic 
revolution to damage the Islamic republic. 
  We can recall the years when the enemy first tried, by 
various means and by the dissemination of lies and rumors, to 
assassinate the character of the harmless martyr Beheshti, and, 
since it met with the decisive reaction of the Islamic nation 
and the imam of the Ummah [Khomeyni] and since its conspiracy 
was foiled, it embarked on the wretched 7th of Tir [28 June -- 
reference to bomb explosion at the Islamic Republic Party 
headquarters in 1981] incident and martyred that faithful friend 
of the imam, along with 72 of the best companions of the Islamic 
revolution. 
  Today, too, the Islamic revolution is faced with those same 
old enemies and they have not let up for a moment their efforts 
to inflict blows on the Islamic republic. 
  Just as the eminent leader of the Islamic revolution 
[Khamene'i] said in a gathering of religious scholars and 
clergymen, satanic powers are today also trying to physically 
eliminate the clergymen who are effective and important for the 
country and for Islam and Muslims, and their latest attempt was 
the recent incident of 1 February during which they intended to 
deprive the Islamic Ummah of a prominent and effective 
personality who is devoted to Islam, Muslims and the Islamic 
regime, that is, our well-loved president, who has given his 
life and his youth for this. But, thanks be to God, the satans' 
agents failed once again, just as they have in many of their 
previous plots and evil deeds. 
  The enemy is unaware of the divine succor supporting the 
Islamic revolution and the unfailing determination of the nation 
to back the regime's officials. The Islamic Republic of Iran is 
marching forward with the assistance of the nation's support and 
God's blessings and ultimate defeat will, God willing, belong to 
the enemies of God and Islam.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 9, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati, currently in Indonesia, said that the only solution to 
Bosnian tragedy was international military intervention. 
  He called on the U.N. Security Council to prescribe 
international military action to stop the genocide and force 
evacuation of the occupied territories. 
  Speaking at the meeting of the selected foreign ministers of 
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Jakarta Tuesday, Velayati said 
that the latest Serbian aggression on, and genocide of, the 
Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo, had left no doubt that the 
international community had "miserably failed to stop this 
savagery." 
  He added that the U.N. Security Council's resolutions 
calling 
for protection of safe areas including Sarajevo and those 
demanding the lifting of the siege of that city had remained 
only "dead letters." 
  The foreign minister drew attention to the fact that some 
certain European powers were to force the Bosnian government to 
accept surrender and a so-called peace which would be the 
begining of more tragedy and ethnic cleansing. 
  "The Security Council should at least allow Bosnia and those 
who are prepared to help this besieged republic to take action 
in individual or collective self-defense," he said. 
  In such circumstances, Velayati added, efforts aimed at 
ending the siege of these cities in any possible way, lifiting 
arms embargo against B-H, eliminating all impediments for the 
dispath of humanitarian aid to Bosnia and enforcement of 
sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro would constitue the 
least that could be done. 
  He called on the coordinating bureau and the NAM caucaus in 
New York to consider in close consultation with contact group of 
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) the ways and means 
to move this agenda forward in the Security Council. 
  Velayati added that the above-mentioned groups could also 
consider various methods for taking the issue to the general 
assembly directly or under uniting for peace procedure in the 
event that the council failed once again to adopt a meaningful 
resolution.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] While the U.S. Government's media were loudly 
proclaiming that Washington was seeking to end the crisis of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and U.S. politicians announced their 
opposition to the Serbian policy in this blood-soaked republic, 
the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR reported that Lee Hamilton, 
chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Relations 
Committee, said that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be mistaken to 
believe that U.S. Marines will be deployed on its territory. He 
added that the only way to achieve peace is by negotiating and 
putting pressure on the Bosnian Muslims to make concessions and 
to bargain. Hamilton added that refraining from exerting such 
pressure will mean continued fighting in the former Yugoslav 
republics. 
  Hamilton's remarks are the clearest indication of the U.S. 
diplomatic posture on the Bosnian crisis. They reveal the truth 
about official U.S. policy regarding the civil war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Until now, Washington's public policy has been to condemn 
Serbian actions and at one point it accused the Belgrade 
government of assaulting Bosnia-Herzegovina's national 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. Still, throughout two 
years of fighting and brutal Serbian aggression, followed by 
Croatian aggression, against Bosnian lives, wealth, and 
sanctity, it became evident to all neutral observers and 
analysts that the United States was consistently supporting 
Serbian superiority in Bosnia. 
  The United States has always worried about the rise of an 
Islamic government in the heart of Europe. Over the past two 
years, ever since Bosnia-Herzegovina attained nominal 
independence in the winter of 1991 and became a UN member, 
Washington has sought to pursue methods that would progressively 
weaken Sarajevo's government. Although Cyrus Vance was a UN 
envoy seeking to solve the Bosnian crisis, he was also a U.S. 
politician and for this reason evidently acted in line with U.S. 
diplomatic guidelines regarding this issue. He always supported 
and advocated Bosnia's partition and annexing the Serbian part 
to a Greater Serbia and the Croatian part to Croatia. He wanted 
a solution to partition Bosnia-Herzegovina into seven or ten 
isolated Islamic enclaves amid Serbian and Croatian areas. He 
made efforts to push through this solution at the New York and 
Geneva conferences. This is in line with the spirit and logic 
of U.S. policy on the crisis in this European republic. It is 
for this reason that we said at the beginning of this talk that 
Hamilton's remarks were truthful and reflected the political 
facts.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Mohammad Sarafraz: "What Are the Turkish </F>
Government's Objectives?"] 
  [Text] On Friday Turkish jets infiltrated 100 km into Iraqi 
territory and extensively bombed parts of that country. 
Apparently 50 Turkish jets participated in the operation, which 
resulted in civilian casualties in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
  Turkey's Kurdish Workers' Part [PKK] has denied that even 
one 
of its members was killed. Meanwhile, the Turkish military did 
not spare Iranian civilians and killed and wounded 28 people in 
the two villages in Sardasht. The two villages of Tuzhaleh and 
Nukan in (Qasemrash) area were hit by missiles. 
  This situation cannot be assessed without taking into 
consideration Turkey's plans for the future of Iraqi Kurdistan. 
  In Europe, and specifically in Britain and France, steps 
have 
been taken to dismember Iraqi Kurdistan and to form a Kurdish 
state. 
  The United States conditionally approves of this. 
  America's condition is that this process not benefit Iraq 
and 
Iran and benefit Turkey. 
  The Turkish Government is pursuing a vague stance of double 
standards. On the one hand, by accepting the continued presence 
of U.S., British, and French forces on its territory, it paves 
the way for the formation of a Kurdish government while on the 
other it knows that because it has the largest Kurdish 
population in the area it will be the one mostly harmed by the 
formation of this government. 
  Recently, Turkey signed a border security agreement with the 
Islamic Republic of Iran with the intention of crushing the PKK. 
  If the concern felt by the Ankara Government over PKK 
activities inside Turkey is removed, it will give in to the 
objectives of the Western governments in this region more easily. 
  Therefore, the insistence by the officials in Ankara for 
signing a border agreement with Iran has nothing to do with 
their goodwill, and once the threat of the PKK against Turkey is 
removed, the Kurdish counterrevolutionaries' pressures on Iran 
is expected to increase. 
  At any rate, the Turkish air raid on Iranian territory 
should 
not be considered an ordinary act. The Turkish Government wants 
to first send a committee to the bombed region to study the 
situation and then to make a statement. Ankara cannot simply 
close the issue by merely expressing its apologies. The 
casualties that the Iranian border residents have suffered is 
high. If this is the outcome of the two countries' border 
cooperation, then the entire principle of the issue should be 
doubted. 
  There should be security either for both governments or none 
in the Iranian and Turkish Kurdish-inhabited areas. 
  Some time ago, Talabani's forces in coordination with the 
European governments started to crush the Muslim Kurds in Iraq. 
This was an attempt to form a secular government in Kurdistan. 
One can see the role played by Turkey's security forces in this 
incident. The Turkish Government should be made to understand 
that any type of action by the European governments in its 
territory, which will lead to the dismemberment of Iraqi 
Kurdistan and the formation of a Kurdish government, will be to 
the detriment of the entire region and should be halted as soon 
as possible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Ambassador to Iran Sergey Mikhaylov </F>
Tretyakov by unidentified ABRAR correspondent in Tehran on 25 
January] 
  [Text] [ABRAR] What is the Russian viewpoint on how to 
establish peace in Central Asia and the Caucasus? Does Moscow 
believe that it can restore peace in Nagorno-Karabakh and 
Tajikistan all by itself, or does it need the assistance of 
countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 
international organizations? 
  [Tretyakov] The visit by ambassador Kazimirov, the Russian 
presidential special emissary, to Iran is a clear answer to your 
question. Russia does not wish to take any measures in these 
regions alone. It has been repeatedly stressed by the Foreign 
Minister and all other high level officials of our country that 
Russia has taken and continues to take steps independently as 
well as in relation to international organizations such as the 
CSCE Minsk group. 
  At the same time, Moscow attaches great value to cooperation 
with regional countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
and around the world. We consider our recent consultations with 
Iranian officials extremely important and worthwhile. The 
officials of the two countries announced that Tehran and Moscow 
can cooperate in resolving the wars in Nagorno-Karabakh and 
Tajikistan. They have also announced that they support the 
peace efforts of international organizations and other countries. 
  [ABRAR] Are you optimistic about resolving these conflicts 
or do you believe that the Nagorno-Karabakh and Tajikistan 
conflicts will continue? 
  [Tretyakov] It is natural for Russia to be sincerely 
interested in a solution to these conflicts, which not only 
affect the countries involved but will also have negative 
effects on the CIS politically, economically, and militarily. 
Therefore, we are seeking to end these conflicts as soon as 
possible. 
  [ABRAR] How do you view the scope for cooperation between 
Russia and the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)? Some 
Russian media recently threatened the Central Asian countries 
and the Caucasus that have joined the ECO, saying that in the 
event of their broadening ties within the ECO, they will be 
expelled from the CIS. Do the Russian political circles also 
contribute to this view? 
  [Tretyakov] Perhaps some individuals and officials have 
aired their personal views. Russia maintains that the domestic 
and foreign policies of the countries of Central Asia and the 
Caucasus are to be respected above all else. It is up to them 
whether they wish to be members of the ECO or the CIS. 
  [ABRAR] In your opinion, is it a problem if they are 
simultaneously members of the ECO and the CIS? 
  [Tretyakov] We have always stressed that we are opposed to 
competitiveness among various countries in this region. 
However, on the other hand we favor constructive cooperation in 
the region. In this regard, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani had 
stressed that the aim of the ECO is constructive cooperation 
among countries and the creation of a climate of confidence and 
security in the region. 
  Russia has bilateral relations with all the ECO member 
countries. As for Russia joining the ECO, we must wait and see 
the working of this organization. Naturally, when joining any 
organization every country should keep its own national 
interests in mind. 
  [ABRAR] What is Moscow's policy with regard to the Middle 
East? For example, there are potential dangers such as altering 
Iraq's borders and the possibility of the creation of an 
independent Kurdistan in that country. What is your opinion in 
this regard? 
  [Tretyakov] Issues pertaining to national boundaries and 
their territorial integrity are among the most sensitive issues 
for all the countries of the world. In some cases, border 
issues have evolved into disputes. For this reason, not only 
are we in favor of safeguarding the territorial integrity of all 
countries, we do not want any border disputes among countries to 
threaten the peace of the region and the world with instability 
and insecurity. 
  [ABRAR] So is Russia opposed to changes in the borders of 
Iraq? 
  [Tretyakov] All issues should be resolved within the 
framework of international rights. One determine the objectives 
of the circles suggesting these actions. 
  [ABRAR] How do you appraise the Tehran-Moscow relations in 
the Middle East? 
  [Tretyakov] In all the meetings that take place between the 
two countries, we exchange views on the issues of the Middle 
East and the Persian Gulf, and on most occasions there is a 
unanimity of views. 
  [ABRAR] It appears that Russia has recently made some moves 
in the Persian Gulf, for instance a military-security pact with 
Kuwait. Similarly, we may refer to the remarks by Lukin, the 
Russian ambassador in Washington, who has stressed the sale of 
arms to Iraq and criticized the U.S. policy of refraining from 
arms sales to other countries. Does Russia intend to become 
active again in the Middle East and in the Persian Gulf? 
  [Tretyakov] If the United States, Japan, and Western Europe 
are to pursue their economic and political interests in the 
various regions of the world including the Persian Gulf, why 
should we not act accordingly? Geographically, the Persian Gulf 
is closer to Russia and has a special importance to us for 
economic and security reasons. 
  [ABRAR] The West is competing with Russia for arms sales in 
regions such as the Middle East and East Asia. It is for this 
reason that the West wishes to prevent sales of Russian arms to 
these regions and is opposing them. In this regard, Bill 
Clinton signed an agreement with Yeltsin during his visit to 
Moscow. What is your opinion on this? 
  [Tretyakov] It is natural that Russia, which is one of the 
major arms producers of the world, should be interested in 
expanding its arms market. I do not believe that this rivalry 
is commercial, as you state. At the same time, this competition 
does not have a political aspect. Here I should assert that 
Russia is one of the signatories of the treaty banning the 
production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
Therefore we will act only in accord with this treaty in 
dealing with other countries on armament matters. 
  [ABRAR] In the wake of the victory of the nationalists and 
communists in Russian parliamentary elections, U.S. policy 
toward Russia has become dichotomized. On the one hand, it 
declares full support for Yeltsin and his free market policies, 
while on the other hand it seeks to counter Moscow's influence 
in the neighboring countries? What is your analysis of this 
two-pronged U.S. policy? 
  [Tretyakov] Some Western circles have greatly magnified the 
result of the Russian parliamentary elections when it is not 
nearly so bad.

  [Text] At a meeting with the Moroccan ambassador yesterday, 
referring to the religious and cultural common denominators 
between Muslim countries and attempts by world arrogance to 
create a rift among the world Muslims, Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri 
said: Today, world arrogance considers Islam and Muslims as a 
serious threat, and tries to deal Islam blows by any means 
possible, whether by direct assault or by creating rifts among 1 
billion Muslims. 
  He added: Solely because of its grudge against and hatred 
for 
Islam, world arrogance does not show any serious reaction to the 
massacre of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina while, under the 
pretext of defending human rights, it describes as inhuman our 
stance on Salman Rushdie's blasphemous act and his insult to the 
sanctities of the world Muslims. That double standard of theirs 
on the world Muslims stems from nothing but arrogance's hatred 
for Islam and Muslims. 
  He added: We Muslims and Islamic countries should learn a 
lesson from the actions of the enemies of Islam and preserve our 
unity. For we have no alternative but to stand up to the enemies 
of Islam and Muslims. 
  The Majles speaker stressed the need to improve 
parliamentary 
relations between the two countries. 
  At the meeting the Moroccan ambassador in Iran expressed the 
hope that relations between the two countries will further 
expand in the future. He called for the establishment of 
parliamentary relations between the two countries and the 
exchange of parliamentary delegations. On behalf of his 
government he invited the Majles speaker to visit Morocco.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Russia has begun supplying 
spares for India's Soviet-manufactured military hardware for the 
first time since the collapse of the communist regime in Moscow, 
a newspaper reported Wednesday. 
  One shipload of spares has arrived in India, another is 
expected this week and a third will come later this month, THE 
HINDU said. Indian defence officials could not be immediately 
reached for comments. 
  The arrivals mark "a breakthrough in the jammed supplies 
since the disintegration of the Soviet Union," the daily said in 
a front- page report. It said military exchanges were also 
planned between the two countries. 
  The Soviet Union supplied India with about 65 percent of its 
military hardware until its December 1991 collapse, and the 
Indian armed forces, mainly its air force, have suffered spare 
parts shortages. 
  The Hindu report came five days after the Indian army chief, 
General B.C. Joshi, said that the Soviet-equipped Indian 
military had managed to overcome a supply crunch caused by the 
breakup of the former superpower. 
  He had said that while much of what India was getting from 
the Soviet Union could now be obtained locally, "the situation 
(in Russia) is slightly better than it was two years ago." 
  "They don't need the degree of preparedness which they 
needed 
before the Soviet Union was dismantled," Gen. Joshi had said. 
"Russia today really has no threat. So a lot of inventory today 
is lying idle. That is available." 
  THE HINDU said Gen. Joshi would go to the Soviet Union this 
month. Russian ships would call at Bombay "in the near future, 
while the plans for joint naval exercises are under way.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton's Claims"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's State of the Union 
address on Wednesday is predictably a list of claims for success 
at home, and non-failures abroad. Success at home was key for 
his presidency for, he virtually decimated George Bush on the 
promise of change. President Bush had realized rather late the 
depth of craving among his people for change, and did initiate 
certain moves for an economic recovery. Mr. Clinton had reaped 
the benefits of those measures, being in a position today to 
claim that during his year in office budget deficit has been 
slashed down heavily. A U.S. government release on the occasion 
makes particular mention of the President's success in smoothly 
getting on with Congress for legislative purposes, and refers to 
legislation ranging from Family and Medical Leave Act and Health 
Care Reform to the Brady Bill that seeks to control the 
proliferation of handguns among citizens. No doubt Mr. Clinton 
has not made empty claims on his domestic agenda, and the 
inevitable approval rating after his first year in the White 
House is bound to show that it has jumped up appreciably since 
it dipped to a precarious 38 percent soon after his assumption 
of office. 
  But how has Mr. Clinton fared in foreign policy? The 
advantage he enjoyed over Mr. Bush, who had neglected the home 
front, could not have seen him through in the conduct of the 
United States as the world's only super power. The way his 
foreign policymakers messed up things in Somalia and Haiti and 
considerably lowered U.S. prestige in Bosnia could not but claim 
Defence Secretary Les Aspin. If Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher is still around, it is not for lack of suggestions 
for his removal, but because Mr. Clinton hopes the 
newly-inducted second in command, Mr. Strobe Talbott, would make 
up for lost ground through his expert handling of Russia. But 
Yeltsin's Russia at the feet of the U.S. cannot possibly add 
many more feathers to America's foreign policy crown. 
  Mr. Clinton may rely more on subjects specially dear to his 
heart, such as human rights. However, it is noticeable that an 
Asian voice has been increasingly asserting itself against 
Western definitions of human rights. After China, India and 
Malaysia, it is now Singapore which has rejected the West's 
concept of what constitutes human rights. As others feel the 
pinch they will speak out, and the rejection will extend to 
Western positions other than human rights, to equitable trade 
relations, transfer of technology, and non-proliferation of 
nuclear capability. The trouble with the Clinton Administration 
is that its idea of restructuring the world in the international 
order is largely confined to what happens in the West and its 
poor cousins in central and eastern Europe. For the rest, the 
medicine must remain the same as during the cold war -- the 
nuclear non-proliferation treaty, missiles technology control 
regime, trade restrictions, and human rights.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Her War-Like Posture"] </F>
  [Text] Benazir Bhutto's first tenure as the Prime Minister 
of Pakistan was noteworthy for the keen interest she took in an 
amicable settlement of her country's problems with India. Her 
second term which began three months ago is more than likely to 
be different altogether. What is under way currently is in fact 
her creeping metamorphosis into the stereotyped Pakistani leader 
obsessed with enhancing Pakistan's military might. The virtual 
rejection by Islamabad of the very idea of keeping up a serious 
dialogue with India after the recent talks between the two 
Foreign Secretaries is thus not accidental. It seems to be a 
part of a strategy hardly distinguishable from that of all the 
past military rulers of that country. Its main emphasis is on 
warlike talk most of the time and war-like preparations all the 
time. Benazir has already said much to convince Pakistan's 
military elite that both of them are on the same wavelength. Her 
belligerence on Kashmir and her bid to deflate the notion of a 
dialogue with India have amply served this purpose. 
  Benazir Bhutto is now unfolding the second part of her 
policy, viz, to appease the military top brass in more concrete 
terms. This paper's correspondent in Davos in Switzerland has 
shed light on the Pakistan Prime Minister's shopping mission in 
the European arms bazaar. Apparently, a deal for the acquisition 
of one or more submarines from the Swedish shipbuilding company, 
Kockums, is on the cards. She has taken care to keep up an 
anti-Indian tirade even as she participates in the World 
Economic Forum in Davos, and keeps herself busier with less 
publicised arms negotiations. 
  Such activities become significant especially in the 
background of an increasing pressure on Benazir Bhutto's 
government for a sharp hike in the defence budget. Air Marshal 
(Retd) Ayaz Ahmad Khan has just called for raising the defence 
expenditure from 90 billion to 150 billion rupees "to achieve 
numerical and qualitative military balance with Pakistan's 
foremost enemy." He wants that Pakistan must have more infantry, 
armoured artillery and air defence formations "to correct the 
two-to-one Indian advantage in troop strength." The so-called 
imbalance to Pakistan's disadvantage can be easily seen to be a 
myth when it is remembered that the percentage of its military 
spending relative to its gross domestic product is far higher 
than that of India and any Western democracy. But it is not just 
tell-tale figures of expenditure that are involved here. 
Pakistan's political system, some democratic trappings 
notwithstanding, is essentially a military dominated one. Time 
was when Benazir Bhutto wanted a full-fledged democracy with the 
generals having no political role to play. Of late, she seems to 
have found it expedient not to insist on the soldiers going hack 
to the barracks. What seems to be going on is militarisation 
under civilian aegis. The military-civilian confrontation is 
yielding place to collusion. Another "historic compromise" ?

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 4 -- The number of foreign 
technological agreements have shot up to 1,048 and foreign 
investment approvals to 636 involving investment of Rs. [rupees] 
6,297.69 crore in the first nine months of the current financial 
year, April-December 1993, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee 
said, while inaugurating the regional conference of UK chartered 
accountants here today. 
  He further said that the foreign exchange reserves had 
improved appreciably to U.S. $9.9 billion as on January 1, 1994 
from the level of U.S. $1 billion obtaining in June 1991. 
However, he said, there was no room for complacency and India 
had to take all the initiative required to promote productivity, 
modernisation and competitiveness of Indian industries. The 
process of liberalisation was irreversible and needed to be 
pushed forward, he added. 
  The Minister urged the Indian businessmen to upgrade the 
technology in manufacturing processes to achieve their 
competitive edge in the international market as this will help 
in pushing the exports at the targetted level. He said that 
increasing the competitiveness of our exports was the only 
viable alternative for long-term balance of payment problem. 
The Government on its part has already taken certain measures, 
for upgrading the technology of the economy to boost the 
exports, he added. 
  The increase in exports by 20 per cent during April-Dec. 
1993 
over the corresponding period of the previous year and decline 
in imports by 1.3 per cent during the same period is result of 
the measures taken by the Government to step up exports. As a 
consequence the balance of trade has come down to U.S. $732 
million during April-December 1993, compared to U.S. $3,555 
million during the corresponding period of the previous year, 
Mr. Mukherjee said. 
  The Minister said that the estimated balance of trade during 
current financial year 1993-94 may be less than U.S. $1 billion 
as compared to pound sterling 3.3 billion for the year 1992-93. 
The increase in exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) 
were cited as the main reasons for improvement in the balance of 
payment position by him. 
  Speaking about the next phase of the reform process, the 
Commerce Minister called for an integrated strategy to further 
exports. 
  In particular, he stressed upon reform in the commercial 
banking sector with regard to cost and quality of credit, 
bridging of information gap and adjusting policies to suit 
environmental concerns.

<F P=106> [Commentary by correspondent Ashnarain Roy] </F>
  [Text] The old adage -- physician heal thyself -- is 
nowhere more appropriate and pertinent than in Pakistan, a case 
[as heard] which has unabashedly sought to use human rights as a 
stick to beat India in an attempt to cover up its blatant human 
rights abuses. Within days of Pakistani prime minister, Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto's vile charge at the Geneva meeting of the UN 
Human Rights Commission that New Delhi was violating Kashmiri 
human rights, the U.S. State Department has taken Pakistan to 
task for its failure to protect the rights of non-Muslims who 
have been subjected to frequent extrajudicial killings, 
disappearance, and arbitrary arrests. The report has said that 
religious zealots continue to discriminate against and persecute 
non-Muslims basing their activities and part on discriminating 
legislation against religious minorities. [sentence as heard] 
  Pakistani leaders have abused the international fora not 
only 
to internationalize the Kashmir issue, but also sought to 
publicize lies and launched a hysterical tirade against India. 
Both the union finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and the 
former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, 
have done well to expose the real face of Islamabad at Geneva. 
The State Department report is, by and large, in conformity 
with similar reports of human rights violations catalogued by 
the Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
  Members of Pakistan's Hindu, Christian, Ahmediyas, Sikh, 
Bahai, and other minority communities were banned from 
contesting general seats in the elections in 1985 and were 
restricted to voting in a system of separate electorate for 
minorities. Ahmediyas have also suffered widespread 
discrimination, suppression, and violence since they were 
declared non-Muslims in 1974. The U.S. State Department report 
has referred to extrajudicial killings, often in the form of 
staged police encounters, resulting in the death of suspects as 
also death resulting from physical abuse of prisoners and 
detainees by police. It says there continues to be persuasive 
evidence of misuse of police powers. Corruption, including 
extortion, is rampant. Police and jailers often use force to 
coerce confession and to compel detainees and prisoners to 
discriminate others. Although police in Pakistan are required 
by law to obtain a warrant before entering a private home, this 
legal requirement is complied more in breach than in compliance 
and Pakistan is using the law of blasphemy against minority 
groups such as the Christians. This law is a threat to freedom 
of expression and belief and it continues to allow exploitation 
and intimidation in the name of religion. 
  Another discriminatory law against minorities pertains to 
separate electorates. It not only violates the international 
convention on civil and political rights but also the joint 
electorates concept under the 1973 constitution. The most 
recent encroachment on religious freedom is a requirement that 
religion be listed on the national identity cards. Such a 
practice amounts to religious apartheid. Even though Pakistan 
has acceded to the universal declaration of human rights, its 
laws violate article 25 and 18 of this declaration. Pakistan 
has moved away from its founding principle of religious freedom. 
Laws such as the convention law clearly violate basic 
principles of international human rights. Pakistan is also a 
signatory to basic human rights conventions. But its laws stand 
in direct contradiction to the principles found in these 
treaties. 
  In a new 74 page report, the Amnesty International said last 
December that torture, including rape, in the custody of police, 
paramilitary, and armed forces is endemic in Pakistan. The 
report further said that members of these forces have been 
allowed to torture and kill with impunity. Victims and their 
families feel great difficulties and danger, if they try to seek 
redress.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi 
has criticized the statements issued by terrorist groups through 
foreign news agencies following any incident. He described 
these statements as a sign of bankruptcy, noting that they come 
in reaction to the constant security campaigns and the 
tightening of the noose around the terrorists. 
  In remarks he made today after attending a ceremony on 
training day for the Central Security Forces in al-Jizah, 
al-Alfi noted that terrorist group members are criminals who do 
not enjoy recognition. He stressed that the initiative is now in 
the hands of the security agencies, which receive high-level 
training, maintain planning and coordination, and achieve 
constant success. 
  The interior minister noted that the statements released by 
the terrorist groups are the result of the strong and successful 
blows by the security agencies against their dens and that their 
statements are mere noise designed to show that they exist. 
  Al-Alfi pointed out that there were security shortcomings in 
the attack on the showroom owned by al-Sayyid Yahya, the main 
witness in the case of the attempted assassination of Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. He noted that an investigation is now 
being conducted by inspection teams from the Ministry of 
Interior to determine who was responsible for the security 
shortcomings. 
  Asked if some of those who carried out the attack were 
arrested, al-Alfi asked to delay the announcement of arrests of 
any suspects, adding that the Interior Ministry will issue a 
statement when the time comes to maintain the confidentiality of 
information for the sake of the public good. 
  In response to a question on tightening security around 
citizens who give out information to security agencies, al-Alfi 
emphasized that those who give information are under protection, 
although this is done secretly. He added: If a mistake has 
been made in one area, this does not mean that mistakes will 
continue. 
  Asked about the bomb that exploded yesterday in front of the 
Central Bank branch in Ramsis Square, the interior minister said 
that it was a trivial thing done to prove that the terrorists 
are still present. 
  Asked about the security situation in Asyut, the interior 
minister stressed that the situation is completely calm there 
and that there is a security presence and that security agencies 
are constantly being modernized. The interior minister referred 
to the regrettable incident that claimed the life of Brigadier 
General 'Umar Hasan Mustafa the day before yesterday, adding 
that it happened because of a personal error by martyr Brig. 
Gen. 'Umar, who used his private car on his day off without any 
guards accompanying him. 
  This morning the interior minister attended a ceremony 
marking the training day of the Central Security Forces in 
al-Jizah, where he inspected the living quarters of conscripts 
and inaugurated a water project. He attended some exercises 
demonstrating how to confront terrorists and break into their 
dens using modern equipment. The ceremony was attended by Major 
General Samir Fu'ad, first assistant to the interior minister 
and commander of the Central Security Forces; Major General 
'Abd-al-Wahid 'Atallah, director general of the al-Jizah zone; 
and a number of senior officials from the Central Security 
Forces and the Interior Ministry.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 8 (AFP) -- The main Moslem militant group 
here on Tuesday called on Egyptians to pull their money out of 
banks within two weeks and claimed a bomb attack on a branch in 
Cairo. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, which has waged a bloody 
campaign against the secular government of President Husni 
Mubarak, said it planted the bomb which exploded outside a bank 
here Monday night. The bomb went off after the bank closed to 
avoid causing any injuries, said the statement which was sent to 
AFP. 
  The group has urged tourists and foreign investors to quit 
the country, saying it is stepping up its violent campaign 
following the killing of seven of its members by the security 
forces last week. 
  The militants are trying to cripple the Egyptian economy as 
part of their campaign to bring down the Mubarak government and 
install an Iranian-style Islamic republic. 
  The group said Egyptians should withdraw all their cash from 
Egyptian banks within two weeks, and Monday's blast was "part of 
al-Jama'ah's fight against the regime." 
  Almost 300 people have died since the fundamentalists began 
their campaign two years ago, and the money-spinning tourist 
industry has been brought to its knees.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi 
has stressed that the security organs serve and protect 
everybody, both Egyptians and foreigners. He said that the 
threats made by the outlaws will not frighten the police organs, 
which have decided to confront and chase them firmly and 
decisively everywhere and at all times. 
  In his meeting with the press delegation accompanying the 
Austrian president, who is presently visiting Cairo, the 
Egyptian interior minister said that the security organs always 
have the initiative and are completely ready to confront the 
remnants of terrorism. He noted that the perpetrators of the 
incidents carried out by terrorists have been arrested and many 
crimes that were planned have been foiled. 
  Al-Alfi also noted that a large quantity of weapons and 
equipment were used in these operations, stressing that the 
crimes being perpetrated now are a reaction meant only to prove 
that they still exist. He added: We have complete information 
about them. 
  In reply to a question about the countries that support and 
sponsor the terrorist groups, the interior minister said that a 
number of countries are supporting and sponsoring the terrorists 
but he refused to divulge these countries' names, saying that 
there are diplomatic contacts to sign security agreements on the 
extradition of these elements. 
  The Egyptian interior minister denied what the human rights 
report said about torture in Egyptian prisons. He stressed that 
Egypt is a state where the rule of law prevails, which has an 
ancient civilization, and which is among the leading countries 
that care about human rights inside and outside prisons. He 
said that these criminals inflict injuries on themselves as part 
of a plan to terrorize the police commands and officers. He 
noted that the human rights report was only concerned with the 
protection of defendants but did not mention the victims of 
their operations. He added that the perpetrators of many crimes 
had been apprehended and found to have weapons and explosives 
and were brought to trial, while many policemen had been killed 
in defense of innocent citizens, legitimacy, and law and order. 
  Hasan al-Alfi stressed that cases of torture in Egypt, the 
state where the rule of law prevails, are not closed because of 
the statute of limitations. He said: If there are individual 
mistakes or excesses in the application of the law, then those 
making these mistakes and excesses are brought to account and 
punished in accordance with the law. 
  Hasan al-Alfi described the terrorist organizations as gangs 
that violate the teachings and tenets of religion, adding that 
the crimes solved confirm that the police are in control. 
  In reply to a question about the terrorists' names and 
leaders, the interior minister said that the terrorist groups' 
leaders are abroad and are known to the security organs. They 
also recruit people in the country in the name of religion, 
which is innocent of them. 
  The minister stressed that these groups' objective is to 
ruin 
development and stability in Egypt, adding that these terrorist 
groups do not exist in Egypt alone but that many countries are 
targeted by terrorism. 
  On the nationality of these terrorist elements, he said that 
they are Egyptians and their leaders abroad are recruiting some 
Egyptians and non-Egyptian under false and baseless pretexts. 
  In reply to another question about the possibility of having 
a dialogue with the terrorist groups, the interior minister 
rejected the idea of a dialogue with these terrorists groups. 
He asked: A dialogue with whom? With criminals? A dialogue 
with gangs? 
  He added that a dialogue with them is rejected because they 
are not Muslims and have no official, constitutional, or legal 
status and they are dealt with according to the law. He 
stressed his intention to continue to liquidate these elements 
and to bring them to court. 
  Hasan al-Alfi said that there are no religiously based 
parties in Egypt and that no organization or society that is 
based on religion and practices political activity is recognized. 
  The interior minister appealed to the foreign press to 
convey 
the true picture of the situation in Egypt and to expose these 
terrorist groups' practices.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah-al-Din Hafiz: "All This Bloody Violence </F>
... Why?"] 
  [Text] We look today with great anxiety at the continuing 
sequence of bloody violence in our country following the 
extremist organizations' violation of the homeland's sanctity. 
They have started to spread havoc and to kill and assassinate 
without any legitimate support for such actions. 
  This bloody violence continues and constitutes a growing 
danger. Some people claim there is no solution to the phenomena 
of extremism and terrorist organizations other than absolute 
repression, even if others are hurt in this confrontation, and 
that there is no hope of eliminating extremists and terrorists 
except through more emergency laws, even if this disrupts the 
democratic process. 
  We stop at two fundamental observations while we deal with 
the issue of the bloody violence and blind extremism that 
threaten the homeland's security and stability: 
  The first observation concerns looking at the situation we 
are dealing with--bloody violence. Things are now at a critical 
stage in the lethal clash with all society, not just the 
government alone or the state's authority on its own. 
  We saw extremism grow and prosper slowly and over many years 
of neglect and slackness--at some times--and tacit encouragement 
and turning a blind eye--at other times--such that yesterday's 
cub has turned into a predatory beast, which is devouring those 
closest to it who sponsored and fed him only yesterday. 
  What do figures say now about the victims devoured by the 
beast of bloody violence. Confirmed reports say that around 200 
people were killed in Egypt in 1993 compared, for example, with 
2,000 in Algeria. Algeria and Egypt after it are witnessing the 
most violent clash between the extremist groups that use Islamic 
slogans as a cover and the state authority and society's 
democratic and enlightened forces. 
  It is useful here to refer to the latest report issued by 
the 
Egyptian Human Rights Committee on the signs of bloody violence 
in Egypt. It frankly states that the armed organizations 
belonging to political Islam are practicing terrorist activities 
and bloody violence, violating man's primary fundamental 
right--the right to live--in an unprecedented way. 
  Proceeding with our reading of this documented report, we 
find that 1993 saw escalating bloody violence that left 207 
dead. This figure is more than the total number of victims 
killed in the previous three years: In 1990-1992, only 139 
people were killed. 
  The Egyptian Human Rights Committee's information stresses 
that "these armed Islamic groups bear the major responsibility 
for all the acts of violence seen in the country" and that 59 of 
the police victims were killed willfully as part of acts of 
direct physical liquidation, which these groups carried out 
despite the police halting their physical liquidation of group 
members last March. 
  The report adds that the number of victims of physical 
liquidation and random killings attributed to Islamic political 
groups is 118, when the police killed only eight members of the 
Islamic groups. 
  Figures and statistics are important, but reading an 
analysis of these statistics, understanding their significance, 
and specifying what they indicate are also important. What do 
the indicators say regarding the bloody violence? 
  1. The acts of violence, murder, and terrorism exercised by 
the groups have witnessed a serious development in the use of 
modern technology, such as explosive devices, booby-trapped 
cars, timed bombs, and explosions by remote control to cause the 
biggest losses, particularly among innocent people. 
  For example, 1993 witnessed 12 terrorist operations in which 
huge explosives were used. Nine of these were designed to cause 
indiscriminate killing. The explosions left 22 people dead, 
including 19 innocent citizens, two foreign tourists, and one 
police officer. 
  2. Assassination and physical liquidation attempts against 
state figures such as politicians, ministers, and security 
officers have also increased considerably. The most significant 
of these attempts targeted the prime minister, the information 
minister, and the interior minister. 
  Although these attempts failed, they left 70 security men 
dead. Some 51 of these operations were designed to physically 
liquidate policemen. The Asyut Governorate--the largest arena 
of bloody violence--takes the lead in assassination attempts. 
Some 57 policemen have been assassinated by terrorists there. 
  3. The groups concentrated their terrorist operations first 
on the police and the innocent Muslim and Christian citizens and 
then on tourism and foreign tourists, which they targeted with 
their bloody violence to undermine the country's main source of 
hard currency. This has reflected in losses of $2-$3 billion a 
year. 
  4. The last indicator is that if these groups have partially 
succeeded in their indiscriminate murder operations, 
premeditated assassinations, and bloody explosions in public 
places to shake national security and spread alarm among the 
people, they have failed in word and deed to achieve any 
long-term political objective. On the contrary. They have 
aroused the public and stirred up the silent majority against 
their crimes and terrorist operations, which have caused 
financial loss and alarm. The people, even among the moderate 
Islamic trends and former sympathizers, have started to take an 
active role in confronting the growing bloody violence and armed 
terrorism side by side with the state authorities. Everyone has 
discovered that the beast of terrorism does not target just one 
government official or police officer, but the security of the 
country and the life of every citizen. 
  The state, with all its powers, and society, with all its 
sectors and its ideological, social, and political forces, 
should coordinate their activity to deprive these groups of the 
sources of their power and isolate them from their bases. We 
must prevent these groups from exploiting the stockpile of 
crises surrounding us--be they complicated economic and social 
problems or chronic political and ideological problems--whether 
this is represented in poverty, unemployment, and corruption or 
in extremism, frustration, despair, and the closing of the doors 
of hope to the youth. 
  How could we benefit from the state of alert and vigilance 
in 
society against the cycle of bloody violence, armed terrorism, 
and indiscriminate killing? How could we isolate the 
perpetrators of this violence and prevent them from exploiting 
the people's rancor and indignation generated by knotty economic 
and social problems? 
  First, we must all reiterate the principles and agree on the 
need to establish our great national objective. We must 
truthfully admit that despite the complicated and pressing 
problems, reform and change should not be made by force, 
violence, or terrorism. These should be carried out through 
sound democratic means based on free dialogue, accepting 
opposing ideas, and respecting everyone's will and opposition 
stances before those of the support, along with respect for the 
full rights of individuals. 
  When the channels for such a dialogue are open, those of 
extremism and violence are diminished. These channels are the 
fruit of the absence of dialogue, the silencing of the other 
voices, and the disdain for the ideas of 
opposition--politically, ideologically, and religiously. Again, 
we affirm that resorting to pressing emergency laws, as some 
demand, is condemned, because it represents a real obstacle to 
dialogue and democracy. 
  While some call for burying the current democratic 
atmosphere, particularly the freedom of opinion and expression, 
urging the authorities to enact more extraordinary laws, 
justifying the expansion of the use of the emergency law, 
President Husni Mubarak, the head of the supreme authority, 
insists on rejecting all this, resisting the temptation of the 
instigators, adhering to the democratic course, and resorting to 
the Constitution and law even if this costs time in the struggle 
against terrorism and the immediate wiping out of armed 
violence. This is what the president stressed during his 
meeting with writers and intellectuals at the international book 
fair last week in response to the claims and calls of the 
instigators. 
  What do we do in light of these principles? Our effort 
leads us by necessity to work through several principal routes: 
  Because the security policy, despite its decisive 
importance, 
is not enough alone to resist the violence and armed terrorism, 
the alternative is an all-out social effort. This initially 
demands efforts to end or reduce the factors of poverty, 
indignation, and despair, which the extremist groups exploit. 
The effort can be made by reviewing the state's existing 
socio-economic plan and amending its goals and methods in line 
with the demands of the vast majority and achieving their 
interests. 
  There is a need to open channels for comprehensive national 
dialogue and expand the circles of opinion and consultation to 
include--in deed, not in word--all the legitimate and true 
political and intellectual forces that express the people's 
clear interests. 
  Any dialogue that does not include all these forces will 
fail 
before it starts--notice, for example, the national dialogue 
conference experiment in Algeria--because it excludes some 
forces and deprives some groups of their rights. These groups 
will remain a source of anger, indignation, rebellion, and even 
extremism, facilitating the use of violence. 
  There is a need to energize civic society's political, 
religious, and cultural institutions, particularly the parties, 
the trade unions, the universities, al-Azhar, the research and 
study centers, and the press to play a more effective and 
influential role in society in an atmosphere of freedom of 
opinion, action, and movement. This perhaps demands a review of 
the laws restricting the activity of civic society, because the 
government authority alone, however strong it may be, cannot 
succeed without the help of the strong, effective popular forces. 
  The most essential issue is the need to introduce concrete 
reforms in the famous three-way system--education, information, 
and culture. These institutions formulate opinion, develop 
character, and raise generations from childhood. We still 
notice with great concern the infiltration of the ideas of 
fanaticism, extremism, backwardness, and superficiality through 
the channels of this system, helping to develop the mind in a 
direction opposed to the country's interests and prepare the 
popular ground, particularly among the illiterate, 
semi-educated, poor, and oppressed, to accept religious 
fanaticism, sectarian hatred, and despicable racism. 
  If we add to all this the incitement against the existing 
democratic system; the efforts to restrict freedom of opinion 
and expression in their various forms, particularly freedom of 
the press and information; the casting of doubt on the honesty 
and independence of the judiciary; attempts to justify 
corruption and deviation; and demands to resort to emergency 
laws, the issue will by necessity become serious, if not deadly. 
  This is what we do not want for the present and future of 
this country.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Yahyawi: "Algerian Foreign </F>
Minister: Zeroual To Issue General Amnesty"] 
  [Text] Brussels--Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah 
Dembri announced yesterday that Algeria has abandoned the 
security option in favor of dialogue. He stressed that the 
dialogue is being conducted with all political groups without 
exception. He urged the renunciation of violence. He said: 
Elections will be held in three years. In a statement to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Dembri said that a general amnesty will be 
issued soon for all political prisoners. 
  The Algerian foreign minister was speaking to AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT in Brussels, where he attended the meetings of the 
European-Algerian joint cooperation council. He asked for 
European aid to help to extricate Algeria from its economic 
crisis. It was announced yesterday that President Liamine 
Zeroual had received the national dialogue committee, which 
arranged the national conference held on 25 January. 
  On the situation in Algeria, Dembri said: The dialogue plan 
is continuing among all Algerian political groups without 
exception. It is essential, because the political and economic 
crisis requires united efforts from all Algerian people. We 
also urge those taking part in national accord to renounce 
violence as a means to reach or remain in power. I believe that 
in three years we will return to the electoral march and build a 
new legitimacy to establish an authority in Algeria. 
  Pointing out that he is the foreign minister and a member of 
the committee that appointed the head of state, he said: I 
believe that President Zeroual has from the outset -- as 
mentioned in his swearing-in speech and the speech delivered the 
day before yesterday -- clarified the new framework for dialogue 
in Algeria, clearly excluding the security option as a solution 
in Algeria and giving precedence to dialogue. Because security 
and stability are the responsibility of every Algerian man and 
woman. Dembri added: There are very reassuring prospects in 
Algeria, which causes us to ask Arab public opinion to support 
the transition phase the country is experiencing and not to 
choose between Algeria's sons. 
  Regarding his current mission in Brussels, the Algerian 
foreign minister said: We are hoping to reach during our 
meetings with European officials a formula leading to the 
signing of a new partnership agreement between Algeria and the 
EC as soon as possible and laying common ground for a free 
exchange between the two parties. The agreement we are seeking 
will also expand within the framework of cooperation with the 
Maghreb community, especially Tunisia and Morocco. It is 
necessary that we as the Maghreb Union act as a bloc to 
negotiate with the EC in order to guarantee for ourselves a 
flourishing future.

Lebanon, al-Asad wants to have a card to play in the 
negotiations. Lubrani said President al-Asad wants to make us 
pay to end this threat. 
  Lubrani warned that Israel will continue to strike on all 
occasions and with all means against Hizballah and other 
terrorist organizations. He indicated that any suspension of 
the talks with Syria and Lebanon would ultimately serve 
Hizballah.

<F P=106> [By Jihad Zayir and Rasmiyah Minwir] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special 
Commission, has asserted that his talks in Baghdad will focus 
this time on an all-out, rather than a partial, lifting of the 
sanctions, as was the case in the past. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH upon his arrival 
at the al-Rashid Hotel, where he is staying in Baghdad, Ekeus 
added that the UN Security Council is fully prepared to find 
solutions to the issues related to the lifting of the sanctions 
imposed on Iraq. Nonetheless, Ekeus noted, I do acknowledge that 
our discussions will address complicated political and technical 
issues. 
  When asked by AL-JUMHURIYAH why the statements he makes in 
Baghdad on the prospects for lifting the sanctions are 
optimistic, whereas the statements he makes on the issue when he 
is outside Iraq are different, Ekeus said that he hopes that 
rapid steps will be taken this time to lift the embargo imposed 
on Iraq after he apprises the UN Security Council of the outcome 
of his Baghdad talks, which he expects to be positive. 
  When questioned if he is aware of the fact that he is 
responsible for the Iraqi people's continued suffering, which is 
caused by the embargo and prolonged talks on Iraq's compliance 
with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, even though 
Iraq has honored all its commitments as enshrined in these 
resolutions, particularly those regarding Paragraph C, when the 
UN Security Council has failed to honor its commitments as 
enshrined in Article 22 of Resolution 687, Ekeus said: This 
time, I will make a personal effort. I will talk to all 
competent agencies about lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq. 
This will be a personal effort on my part. It will also 
reflect my sense of responsibility toward the Iraqi people. 
This is because I, from the humanitarian point of view, am 
aware of what the continuation of the sanctions means. 
Nonetheless, any decision on the sanctions issue is contingent 
upon the outcome of these talks. 
  We posed the following question to Ekeus: Is it fair that 
the Iraqi people should continue to suffer from the effects of 
this unfair embargo, even though Iraq has all along been 
honoring its commitments toward the UN Security Council? His 
answer was as follows: What can we do? These are the results 
of the Gulf War. We will try to find some solutions. 
  We asked him whether he is optimistic about the outcome of 
the talks this time. He said: Maybe, maybe. 
  Rolf Ekeus came to tears when a glorious Iraqi woman named 
Zahra' Yahya, widow of martyr Mu'izz al-Qaysi and mother of 
martyr Muhammad, approached him with a photograph of her 
martyred son, and asked him whether he recognized the child in 
the picture. She addressed him, saying: It is my son Muhammad. 
I lost him and his father, too. Do you know why? 
  Ekeus replied: No. 
  Zahra' said: My son was martyred when the United States 
launched a missile attack on Baghdad in June 1993. 
  Ekeus said: I am sorry for this outcome. 
  She answered him saying: What do I have today with your 
regrets? I will sue you. I will sue the United States. I will 
sue the United Nations and the UN Security Council. You come 
here to discuss the destruction of Iraq's weapons. Meanwhile, 
you allow the United States to kill Iraqis with its weapons. 
You have failed to take any measures against the United States. 
  Ekeus repeated his strong regrets over the loss of her 
husband and son. But Zahra' continued to speak to him in fluent 
English, asking him and the UN Security Council to take a 
humanitarian position on the crimes perpetrated against the 
Iraqi people. Then, Ekeus could not restrain himself any 
longer. He came to tears and repeated: "Madame, I am very 
sorry for you." Afterward, he left us. 
  Meanwhile, a Belgian journalist who was nearby, having seen 
Mr. Ekeus' tears, commented, saying: Impossible. Is it 
possible for Mr. Ekeus to weep and shed real tears? How can 
this stony-hearted man weep?

<F P=106> ["Above the Red Line" column: "Negative Effects of the Trade </F>
Ministry's Food Price List" by Faruq Jasim al-'Azzawi] 
  [Text] The Trade Ministry has a struggling role in the 
present economic conditions to meet the people's ration card 
requirements despite all economic obstacles, no matter how 
justifiable, and the fluctuations in food prices due to the rise 
or fall of the dollar exchange rate. No doubt, the ministry's 
economic activity is scientific and enlightened, taking into 
consideration all factors affecting the stability of the market. 
The ministry's operations room is also doing an excellent job. 
However, those in charge of the food price list have failed so 
far to examine market conditions and the movements and stability 
of prices before rushing in an unstudied manner to fix the new 
food prices. This has led to grave results, such as 
destabilizing the market and causing anxiety to the citizen who 
has to shoulder new prices which are beyond his means. This is 
in addition to their effect on hiking the dollar exchange rate. 
I do not want to go into detail on the Trade Ministry's 
numerous measures and guidelines to explain their serious 
economic effects on what I have just mentioned. I will simply 
discuss one item, ghee, to prove the erroneous method used by 
the Trade Ministry in fixing the prices of ghee and other items 
in the food price list. 
  More than one month ago, the Trade Ministry fixed the price 
of one kg of ghee at 82 dinars; or 1,225 dinars per one can 
weighing 15 kg. The dollar exchange rate at the time ranged 
from 130-135 dinars. Yet, the world price of ghee was $9 per 
can, including freight charges to Baghdad. In some cases, the 
price went up to $10 for the good quality ghee. In the 
meantime, the local market continued to be stable as far as the 
dollar exchange rate was concerned. Suddenly, the Trade 
Ministry issued an amended price list for motives and reasons 
which we do not know. It fixed the sale price of one kg of ghee 
at 98 dinars; or 100 dinars to the consumer. Thus the price of 
one can of ghee weighing 15 kg became 1,480 dinars and the 
merchant sold this can to the consumer for 1,520 dinars; an 
increase of 255 dinars over the price of ghee on the previous 
list. What has happened to justify this increase? Has there 
been an increase in world prices -- to our knowledge the world 
price has stabilized at $9 per per can -- or was the Ministry 
trying to absorb the currency surplus, and this also is not 
correct? The Trade Ministry pays the merchants 28-35 million 
dinars daily [in subsidy]. The effects of the Trade Ministry's 
list are clear to everyone from the big jump in the dollar 
exchange rate. The dollar exchange rate jumped from 135 to 180 
dinars after the new list. The merchants fought one another to 
get dollars at any price in order to quickly benefit from the 
large profit embedded in the Trade Ministry's new list. This 
has resulted in a tangible increase in food prices, thereby 
affecting the citizen's purchasing power and adding more burdens 
that are beyond his means. Whose interest is being served by 
this price list; and under what consideration has this list been 
produced? The price spiral must be borne by the Trade Ministry 
and its devastating food price list, since this list includes 
basic items in the ration card, such as sugar, rice, ghee, oil, 
flour, and tea. 
  The new price list lacked objectivity by not viewing current 
conditions within their wider perspective and considering the 
numerous burdens on the citizen. The price list has come bare 
of any deep sense of responsibility toward the citizen. In 
fact, it is a time bomb threatening the market. The market has 
been disturbed and the dollar exchange rate market is active 
again. The Trade Ministry has contributed to the new spiral of 
the dollar exchange rate. All this has taken place thanks to 
the Trade Ministry's food price list.

<F P=106> [Report by Salim 'Ali Dhiyab, Jordan TV correspondent for </F>
political affairs] 
  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has chaired a cabinet 
meeting in the presence of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan 
and Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir. His majesty 
reviewed the results of his recent visit to the United States, 
Austria, and Croatia. His majesty also reviewed the results of 
his recent visit to Syria. 
  The discussion during the cabinet session also dealt with a 
number of domestic issues. His majesty talked about the 
importance of maintaining the people's water, food, and medicine 
supplies, as well as meeting their basic needs. The king noted 
that we are facing a phase of challenges, adding that the 
Jordanian people should be well prepared to face this phase. 
  Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali briefed his 
majesty on the mechanism through which the best services are 
being rendered to people in all fields of life. 
  King Husayn told journalists at the end of the cabinet 
session that every effort is being made to provide the best 
possible services to the Jordanian citizens, noting that we all 
always work to underscore the need to care for them. 
  [Begin recording] [Husayn] This was an opportunity to brief 
the brothers on a part of what took place. Naturally, the prime 
minister was abreast of all that took place during my absence. 
Again, I underscored my absolute confidence in, and my gratitude 
and appreciation for, the prime minister and this government for 
the services they are providing to the homeland under these 
delicate circumstances and with our great hopes for the future. 
Naturally, we reviewed many projects and many studies in 
general, and some in detail. 
  [Dhiyab] Your Majesty, in your capacity as the sponsor of 
Yemeni reconciliation, what are the most recent developments? 
  [Husayn] We hope our brothers in Yemen will succeed in 
ending 
what they are dealing with in this phase. We also hope that we 
will have the honor of hosting their meeting in Amman to save 
Yemen now and open the road for a prosperous future, God 
willing. We have given our utmost, and we will be very happy to 
see an opportunity to resolve and tackle the existing problems 
within the Arab community. We responded throughout this to the 
desire of the two parties of our brothers in Yemen. We always 
appreciate the confidence they have placed in us. We ask God to 
grant us success in assuming our duty toward them. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, how do you view the future of the 
peace process in light of the recent developments and in light 
of your recent efforts represented in your visit to the United 
States and to Damascus? And what are the results of the last 
round of the Arab-Israeli peace talks? 
  [Husayn] I believe that as things go on, we monitor what is 
happening within our utmost capabilities. Our basic stand is to 
support the Palestinian brothers with regard to their rights on 
their national soil. I cannot say that the present coordination 
is at it should be. With regard to Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon 
coordination is normal. Praise be to God, the situation is 
good, reassuring, and promising. The recent meetings achieved 
some progress. With regard to Jordan, we concentrate on the 
agenda and on its topics. As with regard to the whole world, 
everybody hopes that this march, which has passed the point of 
no return, will continue until we reach a just and comprehensive 
solution that will be accepted by the coming generations. 
  [Reporter] Sir, what are the most prominent topics you 
discussed during your visit to sisterly Syria? 
  [Husayn] First, I had a duty to fulfill toward a big and 
dear 
brother who was hard hit by a mournful event, which hit me and 
hit us all, as a result of his loss of his son, whom I also 
considered as my son. So, I had to pay this visit immediately 
after my return. We also reviewed the peace process, bilateral 
cooperation, all issues in the region, the contacts we made in 
the world both on the part of his excellency the president and 
on my part. I emerged very satisfied with the results of this 
visit. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, with regard to martyr Na'ib 
al-Ma'ayitah and the Lebanese Government's arrest of the 
criminals who carried out this operation. What are the measures 
to be taken by the Jordanian Government regarding this? 
  [Husayn] We are following the issue with great concern and 
determination to reach what is required regarding such a hideous 
crime. We appreciate the efforts that the brothers in Lebanon 
have exerted and are exerting to reveal all the objectives and 
dimensions of this crime. I cannot say more than this at this 
point. [end recording]

  [Text] Pakistan has once again lodged a strong protest 
regarding India's vilification campaign against the Pakistani 
prime minister. The protest note was handed to the Indian high 
commissioner in Islamabad today. Briefing reporters, a Foreign 
Office spokesman referred to statements by the Indian president 
and by Salman Khurshid, minister of state for external affairs. 
He said that India cannot use such vilification to divert the 
world's attention from the atrocities being committed in 
occupied Kashmir. He said that such statements reflect India's 
helplessness in Kashmir, and give the impression that India has 
no alternative but to resort to a vilification campaign in 
defense of its policy of genocide. 
  When asked about the Kashmir visit by representatives of the 
European countries, the spokesman said the diplomatic 
representatives were not permitted to meet people freely. He 
said they should visit Sopor, Kupwara, and Bijbiara, where gross 
human rights violations are being committed.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Intelligence and Security Minister 'Ali </F>
Fallahian to unidentified correspondent on 8 February; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] We seek refuge to God from the evil of accursed 
Satan. I offer my congratulations to the martyr-nurturing ummah 
and to the esteemed leader on the auspicious occasion of the 10 
Days of Dawn. As our martyr-rearing nation is aware, there was 
an assassination attempt on the life of our country's beloved 
president. Many people have expressed concern through personal 
contact or by telephone. They kept requesting that we should 
explain the issue more. Although the interrogations are not 
completed yet, I will explain some of the issues to our dear 
nation to respond to the request of the people. 
  You know that during the current year global arrogance 
employed various means to put pressure to bear on the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and on the Iranian nation. This is because our 
nation has refused to submit to the pressure exerted by global 
arrogance, thanks to our people's firm determination, their 
perseverance and their support for the esteemed leader, the 
beloved president and the state authorities. This was economic 
pressure, the fall in oil prices, psychological warfare, efforts 
to isolate the Islamic Republic regime, efforts to distort the 
regime's face abroad, psychological war inside the country and 
assistance given to their elements, who during the past several 
years have tried to remain lackeys of aliens. 
  In this connection about 24 bombs were smuggled inside the 
country. But thanks to the vigilance of the hidden imam's 
unknown soldiers, 20 of these bombs were discovered, but 
unfortunately four of the said bombs exploded. In this 
connection 16 people were arrested. Meanwhile two brothers 
working for the Intelligence Ministry were martyred. 
  Also during the current year, we have arrested about 40 
spies, who have had links with Iraq's security service. There 
have been other security problems this year. Thanks to the 
efforts of the hidden imam's soldiers, the cooperation of the 
Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, the law enforcement forces and 
other intelligence organs, these conspiracies were unravelled 
and neutralized and security was maintained in our society. 
  Naturally, because of his effectiveness, because he is an 
outstanding and vital figure in our revolution, the honorable 
president has constantly been the target of arrogant blows. It 
is not the first time and it will not be the last time that such 
a conspiracy has been perpetrated; they have committed such acts 
many times. We even saw that they tried to assassinate the 
popular president of the Iranian nation in the outset of the 
Islamic revolution. 
  When we identified the main members of the group -- those 
who 
are now known to us as the principle perpetrators of that deed 
-- they are people of bad record, of poor or no faith, 
irresponsible and corrupt. Some of them also had connections 
with minigroups. 
  The person who instilled most of the negative thoughts in 
the 
mind of Nik-Akhtar [man arrested for attempt to shoot 
Rafsanjani] was a person named Mortaza Mehrpu, who worked in the 
police department before the revolution. After the Islamic 
revolution he was purged and joined the Feda'i-ye Khalq 
minigroup. He spent some time in prison and was then released. 
After the minigroup was smashed he became inactive and pursued 
his own evil aims and had a very bad life. He was addicted to 
alcoholic drinks and had unhealthy relationships. 
  Nik-Akhtar, himself, after he left secondary school, was an 
unsuitable person in terms of faith and deeds and morals. Twice 
he applied to join the [Revolution Guards] Corps, but was 
rejected. However, with the help of his friends who were also 
minigroup members he began his national service and was 
dispatched to Zahedan. There he tried to pretend that he was a 
suitable person. He made out that he had good points. He tried 
to take part in religious publicity work, although he did not 
have a proper faith and did not even perform his prayers. 
Finally he arrived in Tehran and started working as a reporter 
in NEGAHBAN magazine and some other magazines. 
  There was another person by the name of Mohammad Musavi-Nia. 
He is a person who has failed in life and feels dejected. In 
terms of piety and faith he is very weak. He is a person who is 
affected by negative issues in the society. He mostly read 
newspapers which published negative articles and tried to 
explain those issues in gatherings. 
  There is another person in the group who, for security 
reasons, I will not name now. He was connected to some foreign 
embassies. Of course, there are other persons who helped them 
from the fringes or provided facilities for them. They, 
unfortunately, worked in some newspapers. If their roles become 
clear to us we will take serious measures about them. 
  The way they worked was that they initially tried to carry 
out this deed during Friday prayers. They went to the Friday 
prayers venue a number of times and reconnoitred the place. 
They studied Friday prayers programs and those who delivered 
Friday prayers sermons. Based on information they gleaned from 
the Friday prayers they discovered which day the honorable 
president would deliver the sermons. They had planned their 
action for that day, which coincided with the 10 Days of Dawn 
period. They thought that if they carried out the deed at the 
shrine of his holiness the imam [Khomeyni] and on 12 Bahman [1 
February] it would be more fitting. They, therefore, tested the 
weapon they had obtained. Nik-Akhtar and his friend Musavi-Nia 
went to the shrine of his holiness the imam. Of course, to 
encourage Nik-Akhtar, Musavi-Nia said let me do it. But 
eventually Nik-Akhtar said no, I will do it myself. 
  They went there and using ploys they tried to evade the 
shrine security guards. They entered the shrine. It was the 
beginning of the speech. The people had not congregated 
properly yet. When they entered the shrine they saw that they 
could not go to the front. Based on the information they had 
received they thought they could do the deed from a distance of 
50 or 60 meters. They found a secluded spot and Nik-Akhtar 
fired at the podium. Of course, the first shot was aimed at the 
podium. But he got nervous and could not aim the subsequent 
shots at the podium. He emptied his magazine and threw his 
weapon down and tried to mingle in the crowd, but the people 
arrested him. 
  Of course the people were angry and beat him up severely. 
Other things happened in the place. Apparently some had held 
him tight and the officers could not take him away from the 
scene. This is worthy of consideration. We recommend that in 
such instances the people should allow the officers to take away 
the accused individual. Otherwise the assailant might be 
killed. The same thing happened to [Kurush] Nik-Akhtar and the 
probability of his being killed was very high. 
  Anyway after the arrest, he was handed over to the 
intelligence forces and the task of identifying the others 
began. So far in this connection I have come to the conclusion 
that these are basically adventurous elements, they lack belief, 
are influenced by negative insinuations, and are mostly 
individuals who do not go along with the revolution and Islam. 
They have taken such an action not because of current 
difficulties, rather they have opposed our system from the 
beginning and for a long time. Although the organized 
mini-groups have mostly disappeared, their remnants may come 
together in circles to exploit the wounds inflicted on society. 
  At this point I wish to thank the Hezbollahi ummah for its 
cooperation with the Intelligence Ministry. I am also grateful 
to the intelligence association, the military and law 
enforcement forces for endeavoring to maintain security in the 
society. May God grant success to all of us to improve the 
society's security daily. Despite all the conspiracies, our 
society, our country is the most safe country in the world. We 
owe this to all the law enforcement forces, the Guards Corps and 
intelligence forces in society. May God's peace and mercy be 
upon you all.

  [Text] The Czech president, Dr. Vaclav Havel, has been 
presented with the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament, 
and Development for the year 1993. Presenting the prestigious 
award at the Ashoka Hall in Rashtrapati Bhavan [President House] 
in New Delhi today, the president, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, 
described Mr. Havel as a champion of human rights. He said Dr. 
Havel has done a (?signal) service in providing politics its 
moral dimension. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha 
Rao, said India has an exemplary record on human rights. He 
said the aspersion on India's record on this issue is caused by 
those who themselves do not have any respect for human dignity. 
Mr. Rao described the president of the new republic as the 
father of democratic movement in Europe. The award carries 25 
lakh rupees and a plaque. 
  The Czech president described the award as the best tribute 
to the people of his country, who waged a relentless struggle 
against the totalitarian regime through nonviolence. The vice 
president, Mr. Dr. K.R. Narayanan, and the chairperson of the 
Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, also spoke on 
the occasion. 
  Later, addressing a press conference, Dr. Vaclav Havel said 
there is great potential for economic cooperation between India 
and his country. He observed that both countries are pursuing 
economic reforms and there is a need for exchanging information 
about the opportunities available in each country. In this 
regard, Mr. Havel sought to have an investment protection 
agreement with India and hoped that the draft agreement 
submitted by his delegation in this regard will be formalized by 
the middle of this year. Expressing his satisfaction at the 
discussions with the Indian leaders and businessmen, he said two 
agreements on trade and avoidance of double taxation have been 
signed. 
  Replying to a question on supplying spare parts to Indian 
defense equipment, Mr. Havel said there is no reason why his 
country should not export defense equipment to peace-loving 
democratic countries. He, however, firmly said that the Czech 
Republic will not export defense equipment to some countries 
which were receiving armaments from the former Czechoslovakia. 
The deputy prime minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Ivan 
Kocarnik, said companies from his country will now onwards 
participate in tenders for projects in India. A delegation of 
Indian businessmen will visit Prague soon to establish relations 
with the Czech businessmen. 
  Earlier, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and the 
visiting Czech president, Dr. Havel, discussed the possibilities 
of cooperation in several areas between the two countries at 
their meeting in New Delhi today. Mr. Rao said India was 
particularly interested in the cooperation in infrastructure 
development. The two leaders deliberated on the role and 
relevance of the United Nations. Mr. Rao said India was 
committed to the UN and its democratization. He also accepted 
the Czech president's invitation to visit the Czech Republic.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Feb (INA)--Dr. Muhammad Mahdi Salih, Iraqi 
trade minister and head of the Iraqi delegation to the 53d 
session of the Arab Economic Council currently being held in 
Cairo, stressed that under the leadership of President Saddam 
Husayn, Iraq will continue the process of reconstruction and 
production and its defiance to the aggression. 
  In a speech during the meetings, the minister said that the 
Iraqi people are determined to realize final victory and to end 
all the chapters of aggression. He said victory is an 
inevitable, unquestionable fact, despite the effects of the 
continued unjust blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. 
  An INA correspondent in Cairo cited the minister as saying 
that by imposing the unjust blockade and preventing Iraq from 
acquiring medicine, food, and other living requirements, the 
United States and Zionism want to harm Iraq after the failure of 
the military aggression. He said this has caused the death of 
hundreds of thousands of children and women. 
  He said the Arab nation possesses all the required economic, 
political, and human resources that qualify it to become a 
vanguard member of the international community and to seriously 
and capably confront challenges and dangers. He indicated that 
a common Arab market is an appropriate starting point for the 
realization of an Arab economic integration. 
  He stressed that some parties' separate proposals under the 
so-called new world order calling for the so-called Middle East 
market or regional blocs are basically a U.S.-Zionist project to 
fragment the Arab nation and grant Zionism an opportunity to 
control the Arab economy and steal Arab resources. 
  Concluding his speech, the trade minister stressed the 
importance of bolstering the role of economic unity and Arab 
economic agreements within the framework of the Arab League. He 
emphasized the need for supporting the joint Arab market and the 
joint Arab action strategy that was approved in Amman in 1980 to 
confront the challenges facing the Arab nation.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Alliance of the Palestinian </F>
Forces--place and date not given] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces has held a meeting in 
which it discussed the latest political developments given the 
determination of 'Arafat and his team to plunge deeper into the 
quagmire of the liquidatory Oslo-Washington agreement and to 
make concession after concession in order to meet the Zionist 
enemy leaders' conditions, the latest of which was 'Arafat's 
declaration in Davos that he had no intention of establishing a 
Palestinian state, but that he was working to establish a 
confederation with Jordan. 
  On the occasion of the beginning of the 75th month of the 
intifadah, which coincides with the arrival of the blessed month 
of Ramadan, the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces extends its 
greetings and appreciation to the sons of the brave intifadah, 
who are stepping up their heroic deeds in the face of the 
growing violence of the enemy's soldiers and its herds of 
settlers. This is, in fact, a practical retaliation in order to 
topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement and to continue and escalate 
the intifadah against the invaders. 
  In light of these developments, the Alliance of the 
Palestinian Forces assert that the Palestine question is not the 
property of 'Arafat and his men and, therefore, he cannot do 
with it whatever he wishes because it belongs to the Palestinian 
people and their national forces, who reject liquidatory 
solutions, and who struggle to achieve our people's goals of 
repatriation, self-determination, and full national 
independence. What 'Arafat says basically means an annexation 
by Jordan of the partial self-rule authority, which is being 
rejected by the overwhelming majority of the sons of our 
Palestinian people. 
  This statement is aimed at reassuring the Zionist enemy. 
'Arafat no longer speaks for or expresses the will of the 
Palestinian people. Therefore, his opinions and positions are 
no longer binding on our people. 
  The alliance again urges the sons of the Arab and Islamic 
nations, as well as all the forces that love freedom and peace, 
to take practical positions in support of our people's 
legitimate rights and to put an end to the rampage of Zionism, 
which uses the defeatism of 'Arafat and his team -- this only 
represents a slight minority of our people inside and outside 
the occupied homeland -- as a pretext to entrench its occupation 
of the Palestinian and Arab territories. 
  The alliance urges the exposure of the United States' use of 
double standards and the extension of all sorts of support to 
the Zionist enemy in order to develop its military arsenal and 
to consider the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories as 
disputed territories. 
  The alliance will resolutely continue its policy to topple 
the Oslo-Washington agreement, strip 'Arafat and his team of 
their popular legitimacy, rebuild the PLO's institutions on 
democratic bases, and secure every means to prolong and escalate 
the brave intifadah and its unity under the banner of the 
unified national and Islamic unity of the intifadah. 
  [signed] The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces

  [Excerpt] Tunis, 9 Feb (MENA)--Algerian Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri has praised the cooperation and 
coordination between Egypt and Algeria. He described 
Egyptian-Algerian relations as solid, adding that an extensive 
program for joint bilateral cooperation has been in force for 
years, the most prominent result of which was the official visit 
to Cairo by Ali Kafi, then head of the Higher State Council, and 
his meeting with President Mubarak. 
  In an exclusive interview with a MENA correspondent in 
Tunis, 
Dembri noted a constant political dialogue between Egypt and 
Algeria to outline the main features of the two countries' 
common fate and the difficulties facing each country, adding 
that the circumstances each country is going through require 
constant rapprochement and closeness. 
  In the interview with MENA on the sidelines of the recent 
meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] foreign ministers in 
Tunis, Dembri stressed that there is constant coordination and 
information exchange between the Egyptian and Algerian security 
authorities to determine ways to confront terrorism and 
extremism. He emphasized facing the conspiracies to which the 
two states are subjected as model states in the Arab world. He 
noted that the two must coordinate to protect their political 
position in the Arab world, since the stability of each country 
means the stability of the other Arab countries. 
  On the identity of the forces that are trying to shake up 
security and stability in Egypt and Algeria, Dembri said: 
Particular foreign quarters are plotting together against Egypt 
and Algeria and the responsible authorities in both countries 
have accurate information about them. 
  Dembri stressed that the policy of new Algerian President 
Liamine Zeroual seeks to achieve national accord among all 
Algerian forces and parties and to bring together all Algerians 
within a unified and prosperous community. He added that the 
dialogue the Algerian authority is holding with various Algerian 
forces is open to all sincere citizens without exception, 
representing the political structure of the dialogue and the 
building of an Algerian society that combines all its sons. The 
only exception, he added, is the exclusion of all signs of 
violence and armed extremism. He emphasized that the dialogue 
is open to all political forces in Algeria that reject violence 
as a means to achieve or stay in power. 
  Dembri noted that he agreed with his Moroccan counterpart 
and 
the secretary of the Libyan Committee for Unity during the 
recent AMU meetings in Tunis to hold meetings on a ministerial 
level to resolve the existing differences between Algeria and 
Morocco over the Sahara and those between Algeria and Libya. He 
said a working plan was established to overcome the difficulties. 
  Dembri noted that Algeria is now holding negotiations with 
the international financial and monetary institutions to 
implement a plan to build a new Algerian economy, an open, 
market economy, that could help to overcome the current and the 
expected difficulties. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, the president of 
the Republic, has condemned the 4 February incident in which a 
number of worshippers at the mosque of the Quarter One at 
al-Thawrah in Omdurman fell victim. He described the incident 
as strange to Sudanese society, particularly in view of the 
hideous nature of the crime. His Excellency did not rule out 
the involvement of foreign quarters, despite the fact that the 
statements of the criminals did not indicate this in the initial 
stage of the inquiry. During his meeting today with media 
leaders, al-Bashir commended the security organs for arresting 
the criminals and said the accused would be given a just trial 
immediately after the completion of investigations. He said 
Sudan's doors would remain open to anyone who wants to live with 
us in security and peace. 
  During his meeting today with media leaders, the president 
also said that decrees would be signed next week providing for 
the formation of the new states and the appointment of their 
governors, deputy governors and other members of their 
governments. He said in this connection that strong and 
trustworthy individuals with leadership capabilities would be 
chosen in accordance with the revolution's method of appointing 
political and executive leaders. 
  Lieutenant General al-Bashir also declared Sudan's readiness 
to send forces to preserve security and stability in Bosnia 
under the auspices of the United Nations. He appealed to 
Islamic states to send forces to put an end to the conspiracy 
being hatched against the Muslim Bosnian people.

  [Text] Khartoum, 9 Feb (SUNA) -- Lieutenant General 'Umar 
al-Bashir, the president of the Republic, has said that Sudan 
will not give up its identity no matter how much pressures and 
statements against it multiply. He said Sudan's cultural plan 
required effort and patience and that Sudanese of various 
orientations did not differ on it. His Excellency explained at 
the first consultative [shura] meeting yesterday evening, which 
was attended by many scholars and thinkers, that the causes of 
the economic problems included the weakness of the inherited 
economic structure, external economic pressures, the continuing 
war in the south and the need to find more economic inputs. 
  Al-Bashir said the war in the south was aimed against Sudan 
and its identity. Rebel Garang wanted to abolish the Islamic 
shari'ah in the country. The peace would only come when the 
rebels came to realize that they would fail to achieve their 
overt and covert aims by means of war. 
  Al-Bashir said the fruits of consultation (?link) the ruler 
and the ruled and enable the ruler to [word indistinct] and 
(?manage) matters (?which) lead to consensus on important 
questions.

  [Text] Khartoum, AL-QUDS-AL-'ARABI -- Sudanese sources 
yesterday confirmed that the attack launched by an extremist 
group on the Ansar al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyah [upholders of the 
Muhammadan faith] mosque in Omdurman last Friday was a cover-up 
for a premeditated assassination operation targeting the Saudi 
businessman Usamah Bin-Ladin, who has been accused of funding 
the "Afghan Arabs" and who has been criticized by more than one 
Arab government, especially Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. It 
has even been claimed that some of them requested his 
extradition but there is no official confirmation of such claims. 
  The same sources said that Bin-Ladin, whose home neighboring 
the mosque was attacked by the group, as a result of which three 
of his visitors were wounded, used to stay at home and not leave 
there and was in the habit of receiving the engineers working 
for his company at 1700 every Friday. That is why the attack on 
his house was timed at 1630. The attackers searched all the 
rooms of the house for him, including his bedroom, and opened 
fire on the engineers, wounding three of them. Then they 
attacked the neighboring mosque to cover up the operation. 
  They added that the group consisted of four people, two of 
them Mauritanian, one Moroccan, and one Yemeni. They belonged 
to the extremist al-Takfir Wa al-Hijrah [renunciation and 
repudiation] Movement. 
  They said that some members of the movement held an open 
debate a week earlier at the same mosque that was attacked. 
They disagreed with and repudiated Ansar al-Sunnah and regarded 
Dr. Hasan al-Turabi and President al-Bashir and members of his 
government as infidels. 
  Sudanese security sources say that the way the group 
operated 
and carried out its attack confirmed that its members were 
well-trained professionals. They did not leave behind any 
passports, identity cards, or papers that would betray their 
identity or the parties financing them. 
  The sources also say that they came from different places 
and 
that the date of their entry into Sudan was not known. There 
are numerous questions the investigators are trying to find 
answers for as they interrogate the detained members of the 
group, especially the Yemeni who was wounded in the exchange of 
fire with the police during the attack. 
  The Sudanese sources emphasized that there was no connection 
between the mosque and Bin-Ladin although they did say that 
Ansar al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyah, to which the mosque belongs, is 
an Islamic Wahhabi group known for its links with Saudi Arabia 
but with no significant activity or influence in Sudan to make 
it a target for such a serious attack. Furthermore, there are 
no differences between the Wahhabi group and Sudan. 
  It is worth noting that the Saudi businessman Bin-Ladin was 
one of the most prominent supporters of the Afghan Mojahedin 
when they were fighting for the liberation of Afghanistan from 
communist influence. He used his own money for the training of 
Arab volunteers and their transportation to join the Afghan 
mojahedin. He recently moved to Sudan and was the target of 
criticism by Egypt, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia.

Assembly, the parliament, has called on the European Parliament 
to stop interfering in the Sudan's internal affairs and to

state of the country. The Sudanese parliament also called on 
the European Parliament to promote dialogue among the concerned 
parties in Sudan on the allegations made against Sudan by 
Western circles. In a communique issued in Khartoum on 
Wednesday, the Sudanese parliament cautioned against religious 
hatred, especially against Islam, calling on the European 
Parliament not to adopt politically motivated resolutions which 
could affect Sudan. The communique also condemned the plots 
against Sudan and the European Parliament's decision to suspend

  [Text] Kuwait City, Feb 9 (AFP)--Police discovered portable 
Russian-made antiaircraft missiles and other weapons in a 
cemetery near here, an interior ministry official announced 
Wednesday. 
  Colonel 'Abd-al Hamid al-'Awadi, head of a crack police unit 
responsible for arms seizures, said three antitank rockets and a 
mortar were found along with the SA-7 Strela (arrow) missiles in 
the arms cache Sunday. 
  Al-'Awadi, quoted by newspapers here Wednesday, said the 
weapons were abandoned by unidentified persons. 
  The Iraqi Army left behind thousands of tons of military 
equipment when it withdrew from Kuwait in February 1991 after a 
seven-month occupation. 
  The authorities have seized thousands of weapons, including 
missiles and antiaircraft guns since an official deadline 
expired for the population to hand over abandoned Iraqi military 
equipment. 
  On January 10, Kuwaiti police said they had arrested a Saudi 
soldier trying to smuggle 36 crates of bullets into Saudi Arabia.

<F P=106> [By Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>
  [Text] Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, deputy prime 
minister, has emphasized that the final signing of the pledge 
and accord document, concluded on 18 January, will take place in 
Amman on 15 February, and will be attended by His Majesty King 
Husayn, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and his deputy 
'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  In a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR from Paris, where he 
is receiving medical treatment, Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib 
said he will arrive in Amman next Friday to supervise and put 
the final touches to the signing ceremony. 
  He said the protocol arrangements have been left to the 
Jordanian side while the Political Forces Dialogue Committee in 
Yemen will finalize on Thursday the steps that will follow the 
signing ceremony, such as the return procedures for Yemeni 
officials to Sanaa and activating political action roles in 
Yemen. 
  Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib said participation in the 
signing ceremony will be restricted to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and five ranking members of his party and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid and five prominent members of his party, in addition to 
10 others representing the other organizations and national and 
independent figures. 
  He said the Socialist Party, headed by the Yemeni vice 
president, had demanded the attendance of ambassadors of some 
friendly and sisterly countries, but it was agreed that this 
issue be left to the Jordanian side because it is unacceptable 
to impose conditions on the host country. 
  Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib highly appreciated His 
Majesty 
King Husayn's sincere efforts toward realizing this agreement, 
and hailed the Jordanian people who showed concern about this 
issue, even more than the Yemenis themselves, and emphasized the 
need to return the situation to normal in Yemen. 
  He said all higher Yemeni organs and apparatuses, such as 
the 
Council of Ministers, Shura Council, and the House of 
Representatives, should be revitalized and convene so that 
things will return to normal. He expected that meetings would 
be held in Sanaa, but did not rule out that some meetings would 
be held in Aden if there was a need. 
  He said he hoped the agreement will be implemented and that 
Yemeni unity will be preserved. He added that His Majesty King 
Husayn's wisdom, spirit and presence will eliminate any obstacle 
to the agreement so that all will return with a satisfied and 
unified spirit. 
  Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib told AL-DUSTUR that he 
delayed 
surgery he should have undergone recently until after the 
signing of the agreement in Amman, adding that Yemen is more 
durable than individuals. Abu-Shawarib is suffering from a lung 
infection.

  [Text] Sanaa, 9 Feb (INA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice 
president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, 
has announced he will expeditiously and finally sign the 
document of pledge and accord signed by the Yemeni parties 
recently. In press statements published in Aden, al-Bid said 
that by signing the document his party supports all the options 
of the Yemeni people. He called for Yemeni coherence for the 
sake of Yemen's unity and awakening. 
  Al-Bid accused some parties of trying to create an 
atmosphere 
that would prevent him from signing, adding that the signing 
will take place as soon as possible. He said what counts is not 
the signing of the document, but its implementation.

  [Text] The Political Forces Dialogue Committee held a 
meeting in Sanaa today. The representatives of the parties to 
the dialogue committee took part in the meeting. The conferees 
resumed discussions and deliberations on one of the topics of 
agenda related to the implementation guarantees. A number of 
the committee members presented their opinions, proposals, and 
views that would produce the appropriate formula to achieve 
national consensus and to define the real bases of the 
guarantees of implementing the accord document following its 
signing in the Jordanian capital, Amman. 
  Following a length discussion, the committee members agreed 
to refer the various views and formulas presented by the 
representatives of the parties to the political dialogue to a 
mini-committee. This committee will review them as a first step 
in preparing a unified formula to (?endorse it) within the 
required guarantees in order to implement the document and to 
present it to the expanded meeting which the committee will hold 
on 10 February in order to endorse it and to discuss the rest of 
the topics on the committee's agenda.

Ugandan plane that had been forced to land in Yemen by Yemeni 
warplanes last Sunday has been allowed to take off for Uganda 
after the northern Yemeni Armed Forces seized its cargo, which 
belongs to the southern authorities. Military sources in Sanaa 
said the cargo includes, specifically, a large number of 
batteries and 15 telecommunications sets for military purposes. 
However, the Aden authorities insist the plane's cargo included

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 10, IRNA -- Fifteen years in the life 
of a nation, said KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL, is like 15 seconds "yet 
in this period we managed to come a long way and have little to 
fear." 
  The English daily which brought out a special 24-page issue 
on the eve of Bahman 22 (Feb. 11), the anniversary of the 
triumph of the Islamic revolution, was referring to the 
ceaseless plots of America and its close confidante Britain 
against the Islamic Republic which ended their illegitimate 
interests around the globe. 
  It said that "save the direct bombing of Iranian cities by 
U.S. fighter planes (the U.S. did shoot down one of our 
passenger planes in 1988 killing 300 civilians on board) the 
Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton White House did everything to 
first bring the Islamic state to its ruin..." 
  The daily went on to recall plots engineered by the "great 
Satan" against Iran over the last decade and a half ranging from 
"Saddam Husayn's full-fledged military invasion of Iran to 
sponsoring resolutions against 'Tehran's human rights 
violations' at world forums." 
  It also took note of the depressing oil prices, difficulty 
in 
procuring technology for peaceful purposes and other plots which 
"temporarily disturb our lofty mission... We do not need to run 
away from the truth. Yes our country has some problems, which 
country doesn't?" 
  However, said KAYHAN, these problems have proved to be 
"blessings in disguise" and contrary to what the west likes to 
publicize, "Islamic Iran had no identity crisis." 
  The daily continued: "As regarding our proclamations of 
peaceful coexistence, the international community once clearly, 
though reluctantly, had endorsed this position (the U.N. 
admitted that Iraq started the war against Iran). 
  "Ours is basically a Muslim society that has unfathomable 
belief in justice of the kind practiced by our Imam Ali (A.S.)... 
  "We have already accepted that the 21st century will be the 
century of Islam. With this in vision, we are minding our own 
business and expect the U.S. to do likewise," the editorial 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Turkey--Dangerous Adventurism"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Following the killing and wounding of our 
innocent compatriots when Turkish fighter planes dropped rockets 
on villages on the Iranian border, some observations may be made 
about bilateral relations and Turkey's regional situation: 
[passage omitted] 
  The simultaneous presence of the head of the Zionist regime 
in Ankara and the savage attack by the Turkish planes on 
northern Iraq and our border regions indicate a dangerous game 
initiated by the Turks, especially as the reports and news 
available state that Zionist intelligence and military officials 
are increasingly present in or visiting northern Iraq and 
sending out the necessary information to Turkish militarists. 
[passage omitted] 
  Turkey's overt declaration that Ankara and Tel Aviv are 
cooperating on combating hizbollah indicates that gradual moves 
by the Muslim combatants are taking shape in Turkey and in all 
Muslim countries. [passage omitted] 
  Iran has displayed great restraint over Turkey's 
irresponsible and provocative actions, which include its 
cooperation with the various counter-revolutionary Iranian 
groups. This restraint and tolerance has limits and Ciller's 
government should ponder the dangerous consequences of these 
adventurist actions. It is the Iranian people and Government's 
rightful expectation that these aggressive actions are halted 
and that the Turkish Government tenders an apology and a 
guarantee that such incidents will not recur.

<F P=106> [Report by an IRNA correspondent from Moscow] </F>
  [Text] Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha 
stressed Iran's role and importance in the region and the need 
to broaden bilateral cooperation in economic, cultural, and 
other fields. 
  During his interview with IRNA's correspondent in Moscow, 
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha elaborated: We don't 
even have the slightest difference with the Islamic Republic of 
Iran hampering mutual cooperation. Asked about the Russian 
Government's view of foreign policy, he said: In view of its 
geographic position in Europe and Asia, Russia should have equal 
political and economic relations with all countries based on 
reciprocal interests. 
  Zaveryukha stressed that unilateral tendencies usually have 
dangerous and negative consequences for countries such as 
Russia, so there must be multilateral cooperation with countries 
such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, and 
Pakistan. 
  He added: The "insane ramblings" of individuals such as 
Zhirinovskiy regarding neighboring countries are not at all 
representative of the opinions or will of the Russian 
Administration or people. 
  On the prospects for cooperation between Iran and Russia and 
the cordial relations between Iran and the former Soviet Union, 
the Russian deputy prime minister added: In the Persian Gulf 
region, Iran is bestowed with all kinds of capabilities, so we 
should establish extensive cooperation in the cultural and 
economic fields. 
  On the upcoming conference of the Caspian Sea littoral 
countries, he stated: Iran's participation in this conference 
along with the CIS member countries is necessary and imperative.

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Atif 'Umar: "The Bosnian Issue Lies at the </F>
Heart of Egypt's Diplomatic Interest"] 
  [Text] There was nothing strange in Egypt's request to the 
UN Security Council to take all necessary measures to lift the 
arms embargo imposed on the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
following the Serb and Croat forces' exploitation of the world's 
failure to stop their repeated attacks on Muslims there and the 
escalation of their barbaric attacks on civilians. The latest 
crime was the ugly one that took place in Sarajevo's market on 5 
February, which claimed the lives of 68 people and wounded 200 
others. 
  Hence, there was nothing odd in seeing Egypt support a 
policy 
that is the opposite of its firm stance on international 
armaments and the arms race. Egypt's firm policy on this issue 
is based on the need to stop the arms race, to remove chemical 
and nuclear weapons, and to establish peace and stability in 
parts of the world where conditions allow. This policy 
underlines the credibility of international legitimacy, which 
has raised the slogan of security, stability, and human rights, 
and has decided to confront any aggression against peoples. 
  International legitimacy succeeded very effectively after 
the 
Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Reaction to this aggression 
showed the backing and support for what was termed international 
legitimacy and the hopes of many peoples, particularly the Third 
World peoples. But the Serbian aggression against human rights 
in Bosnia, which has continued for more than two years without 
appropriate action on the part of international legitimacy, has 
been a lethal blow to this legitimacy, especially as the 
television networks are conveying truthfully and without 
exaggeration what is happening on Bosnian territory and the 
barbaric crimes that humanity can only be ashamed of. This has 
prompted Europeans and Americans to stage dozens of 
demonstrations demanding that their governments take effective 
action to stop these aggressions that have distorted the image 
of Western civilization and underlined the imbalance of the 
human rights slogans raised by Western governments whose 
criteria differ noticeably from one country to another. 
  President Mubarak touched on the Bosnian tragedy when he met 
the Armed Forces officers and soldiers. He very clearly held 
the European countries responsible for what is happening there 
and reiterated that the international community has to uphold 
its full commitments to this problem in support of the 
credibility of international legitimacy and in order to save the 
principle of peaceful coexistence, which this legitimacy affirms. 
  Egypt's request to the Security Council to lift the embargo 
on arming the Bosnian people has met with some international 
welcome. Egypt stresses that its request falls within the 
context of the UN resolutions and charters, which stress the 
right of every country to self-defense against any outside 
aggression. The meetings that Egypt's UN permanent envoy has 
held with the heads of the five permanent member delegations in 
the Security Council on adopting appropriate deterrent measures 
against the aggressor Serbian forces represent a new action for 
Egyptian diplomacy. 
  Egypt, while moving in all directions to stop this tragedy, 
is certainly expressing the stifled cries in the hearts of Arab 
and Muslim peoples. It should be recalled that these peoples 
supported international legitimacy in repelling the Iraqi 
aggression against Kuwait even though Iraq was an Arab League 
member. All this underlines the credibility of the Arab people 
in dealing with issues without any double standards.

<F P=106> [Article by Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar: "An Open Letter </F>
to the Human Ekeus"] 
  [Text] On your previous mission in Iraq, I addressed you 
with words full of hope, appealing to the human and civilized 
side of your esteemed self. I did that on the occasion of your 
visit to the victims of the fiercest barbaric campaign in 
history against an entire nation under siege, in which thousands 
of people are suffering slow death from hunger, disease, and 
sadness. I reminded you that the "civilized" people of the West 
care about animals and birds and form organizations to protect 
them, despite the fact that those "civilized" people spend a lot 
of time thinking about new ways to annihilate other nations 
without showing any mercy or having any second thoughts. 
  At the time, I did not expect Your Excellency to respond, 
comment, or react immediately, for many reasons. Primarily, the 
nature of your mission, which is to supervise the dismantling of 
Iraq's strategic weapons, in the name of the United Nations. 
This mission requires a person who has no heart and no feelings 
in order for him to pass by piles of bodies without showing any 
sign of sadness. 
  Indeed, yours is a tough mission. And a very sensitive one. 
You know very well that the embargo is daily claiming lives of 
men, women, children, and elderly. It is also undermining 
family ties and destroying the foundations of natural life. The 
embargo is said to be justified against the backdrop of the 
"Kuwait problem." However, the human that lurks in the depth of 
the international envoy can never disregard the fact that this 
embargo has taken a course that has nothing to do with the 
Kuwait issue and entered into the labyrinths of international 
politics and its games, which can get very ugly. 
  Yesterday, I was heartened to see that the human lurking 
deep 
within you could not be suppressed by your "international 
mission." This human shouted loud in protest and shed the robe 
of callousness and disregard for the inhuman effects of the 
embargo, when tears filled your eyes while you were listening to 
the mother of a martyred child that did not complete its first 
year and the wife of a martyred young man who had not yet turned 
30. The woman was telling you about her tragedy and that of 
thousands of Iraqis who were killed by a hand wearing a velvet 
glove with the letters UN imprinted on it. 
  A Belgian reporter commented on your tears by saying: 
"Impossible. Can Mr. Ekeus shed real tears? How can this 
cold-hearted person cry?" I felt that this reporter was unfair. 
I am very confident that your tears were true and that your 
sympathy toward the noble Iraqi woman, Zahra' Yahya, was also 
true. I am also absolutely confident that that moment was one 
of your most painful experiences. All of this is good and 
proves that the seeds of good and humanity are still alive, even 
in the hearts of those assigned inhuman missions. 
  Allow me, Ambassador Ekeus, to pursue this civilized 
dialogue 
by asking a question which obsessed me for quite a while. Do 
Mr. Ekeus's tears signal that he will not separate his feelings 
and convictions as a human being from his mission as an 
international official? We have heard about, and seen, humans 
whose words and feelings are full of humanity but their deeds 
are alien to their feelings, as if they are done by other 
people. Yet, they smile confidently and say: Our feelings are 
one thing; our duty is another. 
  This answer sums up the tragedy of the Western mind that 
separates job requirements and personal beliefs. Such a 
separation could be acceptable if there was no other choice. 
But how can we understand the obvious contradiction between a 
person's feelings and his job requirements, when this person can 
choose one of a thousand jobs in which he can reconcile his 
beliefs and job requirements? 
  I am sure that Your Excellency, by virtue of your high 
qualifications, will not die of hunger if you speak up and say: 
Enough. The United Nations should decide tomorrow, and not 
after tomorrow, to lift the embargo to stop the tragedy of death 
and suffering in Iraq. 
  Perhaps, Your Excellency might reply: The United States will 
not respond. This might indeed be the case. However, your 
testimony will deliver the coup de grace that will put an end to 
the U.S. reasoning and deprive the bloodsuckers in Washington of 
any covers in the face of the United Nations and an angry world 
public opinion that rejects the annihilation of nations. 
  Are you going to settle the contradiction between your 
beliefs and duties, Mr. Ekeus? We in Iraq are resolved to end 
the blockade. We have done a great deal toward achieving this 
objective. But we want the good-intentioned, and you are one of 
them, to win their humanity before the blockade is lifted while 
they are still captive to a destructive contradiction between 
human feelings and job requirements.

towns and villages. Our sources view this as an attempt to block 
all access roads into the governorate and prevent infiltration 
by opposition groups. 
  In the past few months, the city of Mosul and the 
surrounding 
countryside were the scenes of many revolutionary operations and 
armed assaults against ruling party offices, security centers, 
and intelligence departments. The operations escalated such 
that they became almost daily occurrences. 
  Our sources say that the checkpoints deployed by the 
criminal 
Qusayy search all citizens and vehicles entering the governorate 
and the city of Mosul in particular. 
  Elsewhere, the criminal Khalid [no surname as heard], an 
officer in Saddam's security apparatus, was killed and two of 
his escorts were wounded when they were attacked by an Islamic 
Resistance hero on the road to Suq al-Shuyukh District in 
al-Nasiriyah [Dhi Qar] Governorate in the middle of January. 
  Our sources in southern Iraq said a security detail that the 
officer was commanding tried to arrest the struggler, who 
belonged to the Al-Ghumays clan. The struggler pulled an 8.5-mm 
pistol and shot and killed the security officer. He then opened 
fire on the remaining members of the detail, killing [as heard] 
two and wounding another before being martyred himself when he 
ran out of ammunition. 
  The Islamic Resistance forces evacuated the body of the 
heroic martyr to their positions to the rear.

<F P=106> [From the "Windows" column by Diya' Hasan: "Which Disease </F>
has Hit Clinton?!] 
  [Text] I cannot explain U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
unreasonable conduct. I wonder if it is the result of catching 
one of the mysterious diseases unleashed by the Gulf War, or if 
it is a manifestation of early senility. 
  A few days ago, he came up with what is said to be a 
carefully drafted report he will submit to Congress. In this 
report, he claims Iraq has continued to produce nuclear weapons. 
In his fits of imagination, however, Clinton fails to 
substantiate his charges by identifying the place where these 
weapons are produced, or mentioning the components of these 
weapons allegedly produced by Iraq. 
  The senility charge against Clinton is substantiated by the 
fact that he has begun to see things nobody else sees. He is 
urging others to believe claims he himself, before others, knows 
to be baseless things, the products of his own imagination. 
Otherwise, how could Iraq produce weapons, traces of the 
components of which are not found on its territory, as 
international experts have acknowledged? There are 
international monitoring cameras installed at its plants. 
Moreover, there are UN helicopters monitoring banned activities. 
  Clinton's task is currently confined to anti-Iraq 
instigation. This seems to be his personal obsession. Still, 
overindulgence in imagination will eventually make him unstable. 
He will eventually become a hostage to a chronic disease, to 
depression and to allergy to Iraq's recovery, that will be 
promoted day in and day out. The end result is that Clinton 
will continue to grow weak and shrivel, regardless of the lies 
he promotes.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column: "U.S. Double-Dealing Once Again" by </F>
'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi] 
  [Text] The U.S. decision to supply "Israel" with the most 
advanced F-20 and F-16 combat aircraft shows that Washington is 
determined to continue down its present dangerous course of 
dealing with international issues and hotbeds of tension in the 
world. "Israel" is known for its expansionist policy and its use 
of all means of force and armed military aggression to entrench 
its occupation of Arab and Palestinian territories. It is also 
known for its armed aggression against Arab countries that are 
not directly adjacent to Palestine, as was the case of its 
aggression on Iraq and other Arab countries. 
  Washington openly speaks about U.S. commitment to maintain 
"Israel's" qualitative military superiority over the Arabs, yet 
it presents itself as a peace "broker" between "Arab" regimes 
and Tel Aviv. Now how can this happen? How can Washington 
convince the Arabs that it can be an honest peace "broker" while 
it help entrench Zionist aggression and ensure Zionist 
superiority over the Arabs? Not only that, Washington also 
speaks about democracy and human rights while it wages wars and 
kills thousands of human beings annually in various parts of the 
world in the name of democracy and human rights. Furthermore, 
its unlimited military support for Israel ignores "Israel's" 
long record of oppression and violation of Palestinian human 
rights. The Zionists besiege dozens of Palestinian towns and 
villages, blow up Palestinian homes, confiscate hundreds of 
acres of land, kill Palestinian demonstrators protesting the 
occupation, and drive hundreds of Palestinians to prisons and 
detention camps daily. Yet, the United States overlooks this 
criminal record of the Zionists. It supplies Tel Aviv with new 
modern weapons and pledges to back its military superiority 
while at the same time it deprives the Arabs of the means of 
self-defense. 
  The United States would not have been able to push further 
along this course had it not found among "Arabs" those who are 
ready to squander Arab funds on the crumbs of American tables, 
those who are willing to receive any old useless weapon or 
aircraft that is thrown to them. Otherwise, how can we explain 
Washington's supplying the most update military aircraft to Tel 
Aviv versus the sale of old F- 15 aircraft to Saudi Arabia? 
Against whom would Riyadh use these aircraft? And, who could 
be threatening Saudi Arabia when it has strong relations with 
"Israel," both in secret and in the open? 
  Anyone who follows the list of U.S. weapons that have been 
sold to Saudi Arabia over the past two decades will find that 
the United States had "swallowed up" tens of billions of dollars 
(other than the billions spent on the 30-state aggression). One 
would assume that all that money had gone toward selling Saudi 
Arabia leftover weapons from World War II. Nobody knows 
anything about the fate of those weapons and whether they 
actually arrived in Saudi Arabia, or if all those deals were 
merely fiction. What is certain, however, are the billions of 
dollars that Washington has received in return for one real 
thing; namely, maintaining "Israel's" military superiority. 
  While pointing to U.S. double-dealing and Washington's 
double 
standards in dealing with international issues and areas of 
tension in the world, we call upon the other "big powers" to 
tackle the same international issues with a good measure of 
evenhandedness and justice. Isn't it unreasonable for the 
United States to insist, through international organizations and 
all illegal means, on depriving countries of even a knife to use 
in self-defense while providing Israel with the most modern and 
high tech weapons? 
  Even the concept of "friendship" is different in Washington. 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, 
who are supposed to be the friends of the United States, are not 
getting the sophisticated weapons received by Washington's other 
friend Yitzhaq Rabin. Still, Mubarak and Fahd are sweating and 
working day and night in order to please the United States. Not 
only that, they are also trying to pressure others, weaken their 
position and drag them into the American camp. 
  The big powers, especially the United States, are called 
upon 
to adopt more balanced stands in dealing with states and issues 
relating to international peace and security. It is 
unreasonable for these powers to prolong the unfair blockade on 
Iraq when it has fulfilled all its obligations under UN Security 
Council Resolution 687 and while Washington continues to 
strengthen Zionist military capabilities with more sophisticated 
weapons, knowing full well that "Israel" is sitting on an 
arsenal of nuclear weapons and aiming the warheads at the Arab 
countries.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column: "Iran and Export of Anarchy" by 'Isa </F>
Isma'il al-'Abbadi] 
  [Text] The Iranian regime continues to interfere in the 
internal affairs of Arabs and Muslims instead of paying 
attention to its aggravating problems resulting from its 
haphazard policies and inability to find solutions to the 
difficulties of the peoples of Iran, the majority of whom are 
living below the poverty line. The Iraqis taught this regime a 
hard lesson when it attempted to meddle in their affairs. The 
Iraqis waged the second al-Qadisiyah battle [the 1980-1988 
Iraq-Iran war] and inflicted on the Tehran regime a 
comprehensive defeat. And when the Iranian regime attempted to 
interfere in Iraqi affairs through the chapter of treason and 
treachery [the 1991 pro-Iran shiite rebellion in southern Iraq] 
it faced the same fate despite the fact that it tried to confuse 
the situation and enter under the broken wings of the 30-state 
aggression. 
  From the Arab east to the Arab west, Arabs and Muslims are 
aware that the Iranian regime is trying to interfere in their 
internal affairs and is working to foment seditions and anarchy 
under false slogans. 
  In a statement, the Jordanian Government announced that 
Jordan wants to make the size of the Iranian diplomatic mission 
in Amman equal to the size of the Jordanian diplomatic mission 
in Tehran. However, diplomats in the Jordanian capital say that 
Jordan adopted this position after its security organs became 
certain that Iran tried to interfere in last November's 
parliamentary elections. It has also been revealed that Iran 
had continuous contacts with groups bent on creating anarchy in 
Jordan. 
  In Algiers, the newspaper AL-SHA'B has strongly condemned 
Iran's blatant interference in Algeria's internal affairs and 
its attempt to cast doubt on the appointment of Liamine Zeroual 
as the new president of the country. The newspaper said that 
Algeria will not accept any claims by the regime controlled 
Iranian media under any circumstances or justification and will 
vehemently refuse to take lessons from a regime that has failed 
to manage its internal affairs and led its people to the brink 
of bankruptcy and collapse. 
  The Algerian paper noted that Iran is forgetting its 
isolation, suffering, and support for terrorism, and that it has 
exported destructive ideology to make Algeria a den of 
extremism. Iran, the paper said, has unleashed its media to 
spit venom against Algeria and its unity. 
  These facts extend across the Arab world from the east to 
the 
west. When will the Iranian regime stop its attempts to play 
the role of an untrusted trustee over Arab and Muslim affairs? 
Undoubtedly, the Iranian regime, which is being disturbed by 
armed popular resistance in many big cities and in hundreds of 
villages and districts, is incapable of playing any positive and 
constructive role in the region. Its unceasing interference in 
Arab and Islamic affairs will only increase its regional and 
international isolation.

<F P=106> [Article by al-Shaykh 'Ali al-'Ujayli: "Our Enemies and the </F>
Historic Mistake"] 
  [Text] In his speech to commanders on Army Day, leader 
President Saddam Husayn emphasized several sensitive points. He 
said: Having given up on the possibility of achieving a 
military victory; having used their air force and guided 
missiles for months without being able to shake up our domestic 
front despite the enormous destruction they caused to our 
lifelines; having discovered that a ground war, if attempted, 
would result in a great disaster for them; and having watched 
the Iraqis occupy al-Khafji without air cover, the enemies 
resorted to treachery and treason. They turned to the Iranian 
regime of ayatollahs that has raised the slogan of war against 
the arch satan in order to mislead the simpletons and to pretend 
that it is not in league with the arch satan and, in fact, with 
all the satans in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. The 
Iranian rulers have carried out this disgraceful act, despite 
all its meanness, deception, and betrayal of a Muslim neighbor, 
in order to support the unjust infidel and to seek revenge from 
Iraq for defeating them and foiling their plans in the second 
al-Qadisiyah [Iraq-Iran war] -- hence their inferiority complex. 
  The leader president commented on that by saying: Withdrawal 
from Kuwait was not within our plans, if it had not for that 
treachery. We wanted to deprive the enemies of any opportunity 
to undermine the domestic front, which was our main concern. As 
for the question of fighting the enemies, that was something 
else. If circumstances did not let us fight the enemies outside 
the border, we were ready to fight them inside Iraq. We planned 
to draw them into the cities, and thus foil their plans against 
our domestic front. 
  So the enemies know the secret of Iraqi steadfastness. It is 
the solid domestic front, which our wise leadership has 
considered the main base. It is, in fact, the object and means 
of the revolution and its ambitious programs. When the enemies 
realized their treachery had little effect by any military 
standards -- it certainly failed in its strategic aim to 
overthrow the regime and to establish a foothold on our land -- 
they declared a unilateral cease-fire, thereby acknowledging 
their military and political defeat despite all the 
international mobilization and the propaganda campaign which 
carried on for 400 [as published] hours daily. 
  Since the enemies can justify their premeditated action in 
using Iran to carry out their treachery -- in view of their 
well-known baseness since the days of Khalid Bin-al-Walid and 
Salah al-Din's encounter with the Crusaders, Iran will not be 
able to justify its action. The enemies are infidels who claim 
no religion or mission. But what do the ayatollahs, who are 
entrenched in the vestibules of trickery, have to say when they 
claim to be faithful and good Muslims, who uphold the values and 
ethics of the chaste imams?!! 
  Due to their strong disappointment, the treacherous used 
their lackeys, those rotten head traitors, to establish a new 
situation in northern Iraq that was bound to disappear, and to 
divide Iraq into small sectarian or ethnic states, so it would 
be easy for them to control its resources and to end the blessed 
revolution march of the Ba'th Party and its masses. 
  If we go back to enemy plans and designs we will discover 
that they had indeed planned for such a situation. They knew 
that a military victory over Iraq was an impossibility. So they 
pinned their hopes on their agents here and there to carry out 
the plan of splitting Iraq and turning it into another Lebanon. 
  There are several points in common between the al-Sa'ud 
family and the Tehran regime, whether they conduct their 
relations openly or secretly -- "the claimants of religion" in 
Riyadh are of a Jewish descent dating back to 'Abdallah 
Ibn-Saba, who extended a secret hand to the Persian Mazdaist Abu 
Lu'lu'ah Fayruz [name as published] in order to stab the Caliph 
Faruq for a cause that was more than personal. 
  Historical documents prove the al-Sa'ud are nothing more 
than 
a guided tool in the hand of the foreigner, and that Iran had 
never been ruled by a ruler who was sincere to Islam or friendly 
to the Arabs. The al-Sa'ud cannot also be dissociated from 
Zionist Jewish policy. One can trace that by considering their 
common attitude, as well as their independent stands, toward the 
Ottoman position on the Palestine question. 
  Put simply, the al-Sa'ud are in full harmony with all or 
most 
of the Zionist Protocols. A book published by Ahmad Baha' 
al-Din in 1967 under the title: "Israiliyat" contains all the 
details of this harmonious relationship. 
  All historical documents show the al-Sa'ud were never a 
party 
to any sincere Arab plan that was hostile to Jews, imperialism, 
and Zionism. Whenever they were forced, they simply promised, 
but they never fulfilled their promise. 
  In fact, the al-Sa'ud's history shows their hatred to Arab 
nationalism. We have all read about their armed raids and 
attacks on Arab tribes in the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, 
and Yemen. Even the Gulf sheikhdoms and the al-Sabah of Kuwait 
know that, and hold memories of stands which may not be clear to 
the reader now. 
  The al-Sa'ud attacked Yemen in 1934. Their position on 
Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir's intervention in Yemen and their secret 
involvement in the June 1967 setback are well known. Their 
relationship with Egypt only deepened after 'Abd al-Nasir's 
departure. 
  Here is Henry Kissinger explaining to us the roles played by 
the agents in the region. In an article in THE WASHINGTON POST 
published in August 1992, Kissinger says: The climate in the 
Middle East became good and suitable for a settlement 
satisfactory to Israel after the following: 
  -- The collapse of the USSR. 
  -- The destruction of Iraqi power. Kissinger points out that 
Iraqi power did not represent one country but a whole nation. He 
also referred to the Iraqi role in 1967 and 1973. He declared 
that the agents in Saudi Arabia were a great support for what 
had happened. They asked the United States in 1967 to direct a 
blow to 'Abd al-Nasir. The also instigated the aggression 
against Iraq and allocated "$700 billion" [as published] as a 
minimum sum for the costs of the aggression. 
  It has been proven that the Saudi Government told criminal 
Bush that it would revamp its military establishment after the 
Gulf War by spending sums to the tune of $12 billion, and that 
criminal Bush convinced the Congress to sell 72 F-15, 18 F-15E, 
and 24 F-15H aircraft to Saudi Arabia to make it the central 
Arab power in the post-war period to help achieve the short-term 
and strategic aims of the imperialist-Zionist plan. As for the 
liberation of Palestine, it is an empty slogan which the 
al-Sa'ud have made meaningless. 
  The roles of the Iranian Persian side and the al-Sa'ud 
side, which is of Jewish lineage and spirit, may appear 
contradictory on the outside, but they are harmonious in 
substance, aim, and purpose. The Khomeynite phenomenon raised 
the slogan of "exporting the revolution" to eliminate the Arab 
national identity, and the al-Sa'ud Wahhabist Movement sought to 
divide the nation for the sake of its common interests with the 
covetous foreign infidel. 
  When the leader president referred to the historic mistake 
-- 
telling Iraqi commanders on Army Day this year that Iraq did not 
commit a historic mistake during the Gulf War -- he wanted to 
draw a clear line between our principles that are reinforced by 
noble values, and enemy stands that are full of falsehood, 
deception, and evil cunning. The stands were historic mistakes 
in part and parcel, and in intention, action, thought, and 
reality. Throughout the years, the enemies have been committing 
mistakes history has recorded against them. It is as if they 
are born with a stigma on their foreheads, a lineage stigma of 
meanness and villainy carried from generation to generation. 
  Perhaps, time and some form of self re-examination will 
enable those who forgot or pretended to forget to learn the 
lesson of history.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Numan Ucar, alias Mahir, the </F>
commander of the People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan Zhalah 
camp in Iraq, in Cologne, Germany, by Behcet Avsar; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Avsar] What were the aims and results of the 
operation launched against Zhalah? 
  [Ucar] The operation was the most comprehensive air attack 
against us. Contrary to claims by the Turkish Government, 
Zhalah plays no role in "training and sending guerrillas to 
Turkey." The reason for exaggerating the importance of the 
Zhalah camp, which has a role of its own, is the impasse in the 
war. The aim is to create the impression that our struggle does 
not come from inside Turkey, but from abroad. That is why they 
decided to attack. Another factor in this attack is the new 
alliance forged between Turkey and Israel. This is an alliance 
forged by the forces of reaction in the Middle East. This 
attack is also a sign that Turkey has become a dangerous factor 
in the Middle East and that if need be it could attack the 
peoples of the Middle East with the support of imperialist and 
reactionary forces. 
  We knew of the possibility of attack at any time, motivated 
by the ill-temper bred by war. So we took additional measures a 
few days before the raid. Our forces were constantly alert and 
always ready. 
  The raid started at 0900. As reported, some 50 planes took 
part. The second raid came at 1400. This attack too lasted 45 
minutes. 
  With this attack, the Turkish Republic showed that it 
represents a threat, not only to our struggle, but to the entire 
Kurdish people. While attacking our positions, they did not 
forget to attack our people in southern Iraq and eastern Iran. 
Seven people were killed and seven others were wounded on our 
side. 
  Four villages were bombed in east Kurdistan. There were nine 
to 10 dead and over 20 wounded. Some 50 animals were destroyed. 
They attacked every living thing in the region. Two villages 
were attacked in south Kurdistan, where five people were killed. 
Material damage was also caused to the villages in south 
Kurdistan. Claims that "an ammunition dump was blown up" are not 
correct. The smoke arose from our five to 10 barrels of fuel. 
Some of our tents were destroyed by shrapnel. Normal activity 
is continuing in the camp. 
  [Avsar] Is it true that the leaders' headquarters and 
communications room were destroyed? 
  [Ucar] Our radio broadcasts and wireless communications are 
continuing uninterrupted. As for the destruction of leading 
cadres: The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leading cadres never 
stay together in the same region or spot. They are in areas 
were fighting is taking place. Besides, the PKK's leading 
cadres exist in every locality where we are active. 
  [Avsar] What was the reaction of the people of south 
Kurdistan against the operation? 
  [Ucar] This is an important issue. Our people around the 
camp in south Kurdistan acted with intense dedication. They 
acted in a spirit of national unity and solidarity. The people 
of south Kurdistan acted in great solidarity fearing that many 
of our people might have been hurt. Some 5,000 people gathered 
in front of the hospital, where our wounded were taken, to give 
blood. Soon after the attack, a convoy arrived to carry our 
wounded and martyrs. This attack once more proved that the more 
the Kurdish people are attacked, the greater the unity and 
solidarity that will be forged. 
  [Avsar] Why was Zhalah selected for the raid? Did Zhalah 
take the place of al-Biqa'? 
  [Ucar] As you know, the Turkish Government came to office 
making great promises. Intense psychological propaganda was 
launched: "We will crush the PKK. We will wipe out the PKK by 
March 1994." All the tools in the hands of the special warfare 
-- including the press, General Staff, president, and the 
special governor -- tried to mislead the public by claiming that 
the special warfare was succeeding. They also gave clear 
guarantees to international forums that they would crush our 
struggle by March 1994. But we are close to March and the Army 
hasn't struck a blow to our forces nor have the Kurdish people 
left Kurdistan, despite the torching of hundreds of villages. 
They created the impression that a great blow had been dealt to 
us with the closure of our associations in Germany and France. 
And recently, they tried to divert attention from the struggle 
inside the country by stepping up the propaganda about the 
Zhalah camp. By claiming to have destroyed Zhalah, which they 
asserted has supplanted al-Biqa', they actually aimed to shore 
up their image before the elections. Zhalah camp can never 
supplant Mahsum Korkmaz Academy, the PKK's camp in the al-Biqa' 
valley. It has assumed no such function. 
  [Avsar] The press reported that the operation coincided with 
the devaluation of the Turkish lira. Do you think it was mere 
coincidence for these two events to follow each other so closely? 
  [Ucar] The operation was due to be launched much earlier. 
But it coincided with the devaluation in Turkey. But that's 
not all. Despite major scandals and failures in the government, 
virtual national unity and covenant, which will last until the 
elections, has been forged against our struggle. On the eve of 
the election, the regime has surrendered to the military. The 
National Security Council makes decisions on the instructions of 
the General Staff. Little time remains before the chief of the 
General Staff's term expires. All these factors coincided, that 
is, the need for the government to raise its morale before the 
elections, the intention to draw the people's attention abroad, 
and the major economic turmoil were all factors leading to the 
operation. 
  [Avsar] Will you respond to this operation? 
  [Ucar] Our war, with all the attacks launched so far, has 
given the necessary reply. We have no intention of making a 
special reply. We will respond by perpetuating, developing, and 
intensifying our war. 
  [Avsar] You told the press that you shot down two warplanes. 
What will you say on this subject? 
  [Ucar] Yes, many Turkish planes were hit during the attack. 
We saw one plane fall near the camp. A search is under way to 
locate the wreck. There are also claims that helicopters also 
took part in the operation. These helicopters too are searching 
for the wreckage. Another plane reportedly fell on the Iranian 
side, but we are not sure about that second plane. 
  [Avsar] Reportedly, other operations are also taking place 
near Kanimasi and troops have been brought to Dahuk. 
  [Ucar] We have some information in this regard. We have 
received reports that tanks and troops have been massed in 
Kanimasi and that the Democratic Party of Kurdistan will 
participate in these operations. We have made preparations to 
retaliate.

  [Text] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has received a 
flood of cables and telephone calls from various popular sectors 
and citizens, commending the rapid and effective measures the 
Ministry of Interior and security agencies have taken to 
apprehend the culprits who carried out explosions in two 
cinemas, one in Amman and the other in al-Zarqa'. The citizens 
denounced these criminal acts and demanded that deterrent 
punishment be meted out to the culprits. 
  For his part, the interior minister asserted that the 
Ministry of Interior and the security organizations, which are 
careful to safeguard this country's security, will be firm and 
punish whoever entertains the idea of undermining and weakening 
the security of this steadfast Arab country. He appealed to 
citizens to demonstrate further watchfulness and vigilance, and 
to cooperate with the security organizations whenever they find 
any suspicious object that could destabilize security in this 
steadfast and unyielding country.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Our National Security"] </F>
  [Text] Because we have only this homeland, and because its 
tranquility and security are our only genuine wealth, we cannot 
allow any attempt to harm it or turn its tranquility into horror 
and security into fear. We will confront any hand that seeks to 
encroach on the homeland, its security and tranquility, and its 
citizens' safety. 
  We know we are targeted by many, particularly the Zionist 
enemy and its terrorist agencies. That enemy thinks the 
Jordanian land is fertile soil for sedition among members of the 
one family, its political and intellectual schools, or its 
various origins. Therefore, our eyes focus primarily on the 
enemy and its agencies, even if his tools were from within us 
and not from his own ranks. That is why we also speak loud to 
warn against leaving any door or window open to terrorism or 
sabotage by this enemy, or any other enemy of Jordan's 
stability, march, and national unity. 
  The House of Representatives, which denounced the recent 
acts 
of terrorism in our country, was speaking on behalf of all of 
our people in various positions and from various trends. This 
Jordan has always been a supporter of the language of dialogue, 
not the language of bombs; of peaceful arguments, not fighting 
with time bombs; and of democracy, and not darkness and 
suppression with bombs or bullets. 
  Our people were shaken by the bombing of two movie theaters 
in Amman and al-Zarqa' because they realize that no one benefits 
from these operations, not even those who carried them out. We 
do not know what kind of victory can be achieved by burning the 
seats of a movie theater and what honor can be gained by 
wounding innocent citizens who happened to be in the theater at 
the time of the explosion. 
  Confronting any hostile act against our security, peace, and 
unity is not the responsibility of our security agencies alone, 
but that of every member of the Jordanian family, each from his 
own position and according to his own abilities. Each citizen 
is a soldier for the homeland and each citizen must stand guard 
for security and tranquility and the enormous achievements 
scored under them. We know this is a transient wave, but the 
highest degree of vigilance is required, now and all the time, 
to guarantee tranquility for our children, security for our 
elderly, and happiness and peace for our young men and women.

<F P=106> [Reporty by Salamah Ni'mat: "Jordanian Fears of Their </F>
Activities Were Behind Reduction in Number of Iranian Diplomats"] 
  [Excerpts] Amman -- Reliable Jordanian sources yesterday 
warned that Iran is still trying to export its Islamic 
revolution to the Arab states "by various methods" such as 
financing cultural foundations and research centers and 
intensifying contacts with figures which influence public 
opinion in these states. 
  The sources said that Jordan's official request, submitted 
to 
the Iranian Foreign Ministry, seeking a reduction in the number 
of diplomats in Iran's embassy in Amman from 40 to nine by the 
end of this current month "reflects Jordanian concern about 
Iranian ambitions." 
  They pointed out that the Jordanian Government had moved two 
months ago to check the activities of the Iranian diplomatic 
mission in Amman after an assault on Jordanian Ambassador in 
Tehran Yasin Istanbuli. They said that some unknown individuals 
broke into the ambassador's home, tied him up for hours, 
searched the house, and stole some of its contents. Official 
sources say that they suspect that those individuals who broke 
into the ambassador's home and assaulted him belonged to an 
Iranian intelligence branch or worked for one of the centers of 
power in Tehran. 
  The Jordanian sources revealed that the government requested 
an official "apology" from the Iranian Foreign Ministry for that 
assault incident but the Iranian Government only expressed 
"regret" about the incident. They said that Jordan also 
expressed displeasure at the fact that the Iranian authorities 
did not take sufficient security measures to protect the 
Jordanian diplomatic mission and discover the identity of the 
"unknown" individuals who stormed the ambassador's home. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has emphasized that it has no 
reservations regarding the activities of the Iranian Ambassador 
in Amman Ahmad Dashmaltajian despite press reports claiming that 
he was one of the founders of Hizballah in Lebanon in 
cooperation with Syria. 
  The Jordanian reservations regarding the Iranian diplomatic 
mission concern, among other things, the funding of the Islamic 
Research Center in Amman and the attempt to have a seat for 
Shiite studies at the Jordanian University. An official source 
has stated that Iran "concentrates its efforts on Shiite 
cultural and academic aspects with the aim of spreading the 
ideologies of the Iranian revolution" but "pays no attention to 
economic cooperation between the two countries." He added that 
Jordan decided that the presence of 40 Iranian diplomats in 
Amman as compared with just three Jordanian diplomats in Tehran 
"is unjustifiable...considering the volume of cooperation 
between the two countries." 
  The source also said that "among the Iranian practices in 
violation of diplomatic rules and traditions was the attempt by 
the Amman mission to distribute books and leaflets against 
regimes in the Gulf, a matter which necessitated decisive 
intervention by the Jordanian authorities to prevent the 
distribution of these books and leaflets." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Syria Urges Arab Solidarity </F>
To Close Door to Israeli Infiltration"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus -- Syria urged further Arab solidarity 
yesterday. It said that Arab rights can only be recovered in 
full if the Arabs reinforce their solidarity and coordination to 
close all doors to the infiltration attempts Israel is trying to 
make through numerous channels. [passage omitted] 
  A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that "what the 
current stage requires most is coordination and a unified Arab 
stance. Because Israel is not interested in peace and is 
proposing ideas that have nothing to do with peace. It is also 
embarking on actions aimed at hitting the peace process, namely 
its attacks on the peaceful people in southern Lebanon. The 
most recent of these attacks took place the day before 
yesterday. It proves that what Israel is interested in is 
implementing its plan to torpedo Arab solidarity, which is the 
cornerstone of the Arab position's strength." 
  The official added that the Arabs must shoulder their 
historic responsibility now, by not giving Israel the chance to 
make its plan a success and control the region and its wealth. 
He said that the Arab states are urgently pressed to move 
forward with one view to achieve peace, which is in the 
interests of Arab states and the region. 
  The official pointed out that Syria needs a clear and strong 
Arab position, because it cannot backtrack on its basic 
constants or accept compromises. And that Syria will continue 
to work with everyone to achieve a just and comprehensive 
settlement that guarantees the Arabs' rights. It declared its 
position clearly, namely that there can be no solution, peace, 
security, and stability while the land is still occupied. The 
Syrian official said that Washington continues to stress through 
the contacts conducted between it and Damascus the desire to 
establish peace in the Middle East -- a peace that ends tension 
and guarantees an atmosphere of stability that eliminates the 
dangers threatening U.S. interests. This is why Israel is 
resorting to evasions, because it is aware of this reality. It 
is not working for the sake of ending tension and establishing 
peace. In fact it is seeking to kindle new conflicts in order 
to weaken the Arab position and the possibility of improving 
relations between the United States and the Arab states.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on the results of the Geneva summit 
between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
AL-THAWRAH says: The news conference held following the summit 
between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton demonstrated genuine 
agreement on a peace that rests on Security Council resolutions 
and the land-for-peace principle. There was also agreement that 
true peace is that which removes all the factors of conflict, 
primarily Israeli occupation and guaranteeing Arab rights. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes the worldwide support for the results of 
the 
Geneva summit and the world's appreciation for Syria's position, 
which opened the doors for peace and completely paved the way 
for a just and comprehensive peace. 
  The paper says: Israel is now facing a real test. It has to 
prove practically that it is part of the peace camp by 
responding to the Geneva call for establishing the peace of the 
brave. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes the strange claims of Yitzhaq Rabin, head 
of 
the Israeli Government, that he does not know Syria's true 
position on peace. Only a few days ago, Rabin acknowledged that 
peace with Syria is very important. 
  The paper says: Rabin's acknowledgement of the importance of 
making peace with Syria must be accompanied by action to achieve 
this just and comprehensive peace. Rabin should be courageous 
enough to declare accepting the principle of full and 
comprehensive withdrawal, which is a condition for full peace. 
Is this not what President al-Asad meant when he called for the 
peace of the brave? Is this not more useful than fabrications 
against Syria and attempts to hold it responsible for the 
killing of Israeli soldiers at the hands of Lebanese national 
resistance and on occupied Lebanese territory? 
  Under the headline "Occupation Is the Reason," TISHRIN says: 
Israel is lying to itself when it blames others for the 
continuation of resistance and ignores that it alone, by its 
occupation of the south, is directly responsible for the 
developments and operations in southern Lebanon. 
  Resistance is a natural outcome of occupation. National duty 
urges the Lebanese people to join the resistance to restore 
their occupied territory and uproot the occupation, because the 
occupation is the reason for all the tragedies and catastrophes 
that Lebanon and its people have suffered. Besides, resistance 
against the occupation is guaranteed by international law and 
all charters. Therefore, neither Israel nor anybody else can 
call for stopping the resistance as long as occupation is 
continuing. 
  If Israel wants to see a calm situation in the south and not 
to escalate matters, then it should eliminate the reasons for 
this resistance, specifically, the occupation and the policy of 
suppression, terrorism, and expansion. 
  TISHRIN adds: Israel has to date refused to abide by the 
will of international legitimacy. Therefore, Syria can, under 
no circumstances, accept to act as a policeman for this 
occupation. Israel should not pursue its claims and allegations 
by blaming Syria for the resistance operations. 
  TISHRIN concludes: It is necessary now to clarify matters, 
since Israel alone, by virtue of its occupation, is responsible 
for the developments and tension in the south. Israel's 
aggressive, expansionist policy could trigger further serious 
results and have a negative impact on the situation in the 
region, starting with the south. 
  Under the headline "National Resistance Is Continuing Until 
Its Cause Is Removed," AL-BA'TH says: The military 
reinforcements dispatched by Israel to southern Lebanon were 
accompanied by aggressive threats that remind us of Israel's 
campaign against defenseless villages late last July, which 
claimed dozens of martyrs. 
  Amid this escalation, Rabin and others did not forget to 
launch a disinformation campaign against Syria in a bid to 
undermine its clear positions on the peace process and blame it 
for the explosive resistance in southern Lebanon. 
  The paper adds: The launching of the resistance was in no 
need of permission from Syria or others. The resistance was the 
outcome of a direct reason which lies in the occupation of 
territory. The Lebanese people, who belong to a nation that has 
never surrendered to occupiers throughout its history, rose to 
resist the usurper to liberate their sacred soil from the filth 
of the occupation. Since the cause has not been removed, the 
resistance will continue. 
  AL-BA'TH says Israel's twisted logic by involving Syria in 
the business of the valiant national resistance to the brute 
occupier is within the Rabin government's constant attempts to 
circumvent the peace process and avoid implementing Resolution 
425 stipulating immediate withdrawal from southern Lebanon. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: If Rabin thinks that his threats and 
military operations against southern Lebanon would enable him to 
somehow avoid fulfilling the obligations of peace, then he is 
entertaining illusions that would not stall peace efforts that 
aim at achieving security and stability in the region. If he 
fears the resistance operations, all he has to do is submit to 
Resolution 425 as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
Karmit Gay and political correspondent Shlomo Raz; place not 
given -- live] 
  [Text] [Gay] Can you tell us this morning that the 
security issue has been resolved to our complete satisfaction? 
  [Rabin] First of all, one must remember that when talking 
about the negotiations with the Palestinians and with the PLO on 
the implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] signed 
in Washington, we are dealing with the creation of a very 
complex situation. An attempt to bring about peaceful 
coexistence between two entities which still harbor some 
remnants of suspicion and hatred for each other. These two 
entities are jumbled together geographically with tens of 
thousands of cars crossing from one entity to the other every 
day. 
  Therefore, the situation we wish to create is very complex 
and we must first and foremost guarantee the security issues. I 
think that we have taken an important step forward toward 
implementing the first stage of the DOP, and I am referring to 
Gaza-Jericho First. What was achieved overall? First of all, 
the issue of external security has been guaranteed. The IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] will be deployed and will remain in 
control of all the external lines: the line separating Judaea, 
Samaria and Jordan along the Jordan River, and the international 
border between Egypt and Israel. 
  The border crossings and the terminals near the Allenby 
Bridge and Rafah will be situated in an area under IDF control. 
Anyone familiar with the Allenby Bridge terminal knows that it 
is made up of IDF outposts which are situated several dozen or 
hundreds of meters from each other. The border crossings 
themselves feature security arrangements stipulated in the DOP 
calling for joint cooperation and a Palestinian presence. There 
will be two sections at the crossing: one for Israelis and 
foreign nationals and a second wing for Palestinians. There 
will also be adequate control measures to prevent the entrance 
of terrorists, the smuggling of weapons, or the flooding of the 
territories by large numbers of Palestinians. 
  [Gay] What do you mean by adequate control measures? 
  [Rabin] Adequate control measures means that things will not 
be like today, when everything is under our control. The Oslo 
agreement, later signed in Washington, calls for cooperation 
between the two parties. 
  [Gay] Will we be able to completely prevent the entry of 
undesirable elements? 
  [Rabin] Even today, we cannot prevent this with complete 
certainty. This will continue to be the case in the future; 
however, I believe that we have arranged for adequate control. 
Second, we mapped out settlement zones in the Gaza Strip: the 
Qatif Bloc and the Erez, Nisanit, and Eley Sinay blocs. Along 
the borders of the Gaza Strip and in areas abutting the 
settlements, there will be zones in which Israel will oversee 
security but, of course, the Palestinian authority will be 
responsible for the civilian affairs of the Palestinians living 
there. 
  [Gay] Are you talking exclusively about the civilian aspect? 
  [Rabin] Yes, only about the civilian aspect although there 
is a possibility of conducting joint security patrols. However, 
the overriding [last word in English] responsibility for 
security is Israel's. 
  [Raz] Mr. Rabin, when all is said and done, will the Jewish 
residents of these areas enjoy more security or be less safe? 
  [Rabin] In the event of full cooperation with the 
Palestinians, with them exercising strict control over their 
side, then security will be guaranteed in the Jewish settlements 
and along the three major roads used by the Jewish residents. 
One should bear in mind that some of the roads are used by far 
more Palestinians than Israelis. 
  [Raz] What are the chances of achieving a high level of 
cooperation and security? 
  [Rabin] Look, if the agreement is not bolstered by 
cooperation from the Palestinian residents, the Palestinian 
authority, and the Palestinian police, then there may of course 
be problems. However, the agreement is founded on the 
assumption of cooperation. The moment there is no cooperation, 
the future of the entire agreement is in doubt. 
  [Raz] When will implementation begin in the field? 
  [Rabin] Look, what was signed in Cairo is a very important 
step toward completing the agreement. Palestinian and Israeli 
teams will still have to meet in Paris, to deal with all the 
economic issues, and in Taba to discuss the details and 
technique for implementing the principles signed yesterday in 
Cairo. In my assessment, it will take at least another month to 
complete all the details of the agreement and formulate a 
completed document. I hope that we will finish this within a 
month but it could take a little more time. One must remember 
that we do not have any sacred dates. In the attempt to create 
peaceful coexistence in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, we must 
first try to predetermine all possible points of friction, which 
are very numerous, and attempt to find solutions for them, at 
least in principle. We must formulate all this in writing 
before we can start implementing the agreement. 
  [Raz] In other words, there will be no prisoner release or 
operative Palestinian police until the end of the month required 
for drafting all the details? 
  [Rabin] No part of the agreement will be implemented before 
it is fully consolidated, comprehensive, and final. 
  [Gay] With your permission, I would like to return to the 
issue of cooperation. In the event of problems, what actions 
will Israel be able to take in order to guarantee its security? 
  [Rabin] In any agreement, one does not discuss what will 
happen if it is not implemented. Each signatory to an 
agreement, and especially so in this case, has ways to safeguard 
itself; however, the intention of both parties to fulfill the 
agreement must be sincere and stem from a desire to achieve what 
was agreed upon in the best possible way in order to really give 
a chance... [pauses] and despite the dangers, I believe there is 
such a chance, and the chances outweigh the risks. 
  [Gay] Can you confirm that all the security elements and the 
IDF were involved in drafting the agreement and gave their 
approval and support for it? 
  [Rabin] Each party always seeks to achieve more and has to 
make compromises during negotiations. For example, the map we 
signed on to is a map that was already presented in Taba. 
  [Raz] Mr. Rabin, why did you leave the issue of Jericho for 
an as yet unscheduled meeting between yourself and PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Rabin] Look, first of all we signed on to a map which 
includes the Jericho area. At the time, and with my approval, 
Peres told 'Arafat, who had raised several demands, to drop the 
matter for the time being and to eventually decide the issue in 
a meeting with me. I accepted this idea. I have made 
absolutely no commitment whatsoever other than agreeing to 
discuss the matter. 
  [Raz] Is there any chance of Israel giving the Palestinians 
more than the 55 kilometers in the Jericho area previously 
reported? 
  [Rabin] I did not measure the exact number of kilometers, 
but the issue remains open without any Israeli commitment to 
accept the Palestinian demands. 
  [Gay] This agreement is valid for one year after which a 
joint Palestinian-Israeli committee will be able to review it. 
What does this mean? 
  [Rabin] No. The agreement is final. What we said was that 
after one year there will be a possibility to review [last two 
words in English] and reexamine the agreement. Generally, after 
a year one has accumulated some experience; however, I am 
convinced that the agreement will be judged on the basis of 
whether or not it has achieved its goals -- and I believe it 
will -- far before the end of the first year. 
  [Raz] How does the present stage of the agreement with the 
Palestinians influence the other negotiating tracks? For 
example, does it have any effect on the talks with Syria? 
  [Rabin] I think that the very fact of signing the DOP with 
the Palestinians, first in Oslo and then in Washington, was 
extremely important. Instead of negotiating with four partners 
without knowing what kind of linkage they would create between 
themselves, we changed the situation, negotiated with one Arab 
partner, the Palestinians, represented by the PLO, and reached 
an agreement which stands on its own. The Madrid conference 
imposed the same limitations as an international conference. 
The advantage we achieved by this comprehensive move with the 
Palestinians -- aside from the fact that we had to resolve the 
feud between the Palestinians and the Israelis, the longest 
chapter in the Arab- Israeli conflict -- is that we created a 
reality of separate negotiations with each Arab partner for a 
peace agreement which stands on its own. 
  [Gay] Thank you very much, Prime Minister Rabin.

<F P=106> [Report by Netan'el Semrik, in the studio, and political </F>
correspondent Udi Segal in Cairo -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Segal] The signing ceremony in al-Ittihadiyah 
has just ended. As you heard, we now have a signed agreement. 
Here are some details. The agreement is, in fact, the same one 
the parties achieved in Davos. It comprises two parts: one 
addressing the border crossings issue, namely everything 
pertaining to Jericho, and another addressing the other disputed 
issues pertaining to Jericho and Gaza. The first, which speaks 
of crossings, is an eight-page document, and the second, a 
three-page document, speaks of the other security problems 
pertaining to Gaza and Jericho, such as traffic axes in Gaza and 
the size of the Jericho area. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' 
reply to a question indicates that the size of the Jericho area 
was not established. What the sides did conclude were the 
principles governing the establishment of the Jericho size. The 
size of the Jericho area will be finalized only by Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat. [passage 
omitted] 
  Many issues remain unresolved, including the powers of the 
Palestinian police and the powers of the Palestinian council. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Semrik] Udi, are we to understand that the signed document 
is an agreement in principle on security issues, but not yet a 
detailed agreement on security issues? 
  [Segal] This is indeed a detailed agreement. Some of the 
clauses are phrased in great detail. For instance, each clause 
on the border crossings issue and on the issue of general 
control are detailed. The crossings issue was the one that 
threatened to kill the whole deal. Today's document specifies 
how people will cross the borders, how Palestinians will be 
inspected in a way that will preserve their dignity. It 
stipulates that Israel will reserve the right to inspect 
suspects crossing the borders. All these matters were agreed in 
detail, but agreement on other issues, such as the size of 
Jericho, was achieved in principle only. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The opposition has sharply criticized the Cairo 
agreement. Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that even if 
the loopholes in the Oslo agreement have been closed, the 
agreement with the Palestinians still entails great risks. 
  Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan said that he does not believe 
that the Arabs will be able to keep the agreement. Eytan 
anticipates further terrorist attacks and a struggle over the 
roads. 
  Moledet chairman Rehav'am Ze'evi said that in Cairo, Peres 
and Sarid had signed a capitulation agreement which did not even 
meet Israel's security needs. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0830 GMT on 10 February 
reports that "the leaders of the Jewish settlements in the Gaza 
Strip are now holding an emergency meeting to decide upon their 
reaction to the Cairo agreement. Knesset Member Ran Kohen, the 
chairman of the Meretz Knesset faction, firmly rejected what he 
called the right- wing's intimidation campaign against the Cairo 
agreement. Kohen said that the agreement was a huge historic 
achievement for Israel and for Zionism, because in addition to 
opening the road to the implementation of peace, the 
Palestinians had for the first time accepted security 
arrangements on the basis of Israel's positions and with the 
Israeli Army retaining overall responsibility."]

<F P=106> [Article by Eddo Rosenthal: "'Arafat's Men Watch Over Van </F>
Rooy"] 
  [Text] Palestinian independence seemed to move a small step 
closer yesterday with the arrangements during the visit by Van 
Rooy, Dutch secretary of state for economic affairs, to the 
occupied Gaza Strip. 
  The Palestinians reported that the PLO office in Gaza 
together with the PLO in Tunis have been responsible for the 
program for Van Rooy's visit and, for the first time, the 
security arrangements for a senior foreign government 
representative have been entirely in Palestinian hands. There 
was no involvement by the Israelis or the UN refugee 
organization. 
  Former Palestinian activists who have played a major role 
over recent years in the intifada, the popular resistance to 
Israeli occupation, guaranteed the safety of the Dutch minister 
during her three-hour visit to the Gaza Strip. Men in plain 
grey suits with a small Palestinian flag on their lapels guarded 
the entrance to the assembly hall of the Palestinian chamber of 
commerce in Gaza, where Van Rooy and her delegation of Dutch 
businessmen met with Palestinian representatives led by Hayder 
'Abd-al-Shafi, the former head of the Palestinian delegation at 
the peace talks in Washington. 
  During the intifada, Jalal Shakak, the 30-year-old 
Palestinian security man, was deputy commander of the youth 
section of 'Arafat's Fatah resistance organization at the 
Islamic university of Gaza. He has been imprisoned by the 
Israeli's on ten occasions: "I am proud that I can now serve my 
fatherland. In our work as security people during the visit by 
the Dutch secretary of state we are demonstrating that we are 
able to guarantee security and to govern ourselves." 
  In a convoy of local cars and accompanied by two UN buses, 
the Dutch party travelled through the densely populated refugee 
camps of Jabalaya and Shafi. They then continued along the 
seriously polluted beaches of the Gaza Strip and Van Rooy was 
able to take a look at the possible site of the first 
Palestinian port in which the Netherlands is prepared to invest 
40 million guilders. 
  During Van Rooy's visit no Israeli soldier was to be seen 
and 
all seemed quiet. But it was learned in the evening that 
incidents had occurred during the day in Jabalaya and Shafi, 
leaving 12 injured by Israeli army bullets. Half of those 
wounded were children. 
  The Palestinians remain very divided over plans to build 
their own port. Yesterday afternoon at the Palestinian 
political headquarters in New Orient House in East Jerusalem, 
Van Rooy met with representatives of the occupied Jordanian West 
Bank. The West Bank delegation was led by the journalist and 
lawyer Ziad Abu Zayad, also a member of the Palestinian 
delegation at the political peace talks with Israel. 
  Zayad: "The Palestinian port is important. Not only because 
it would provide a valuable source of revenue, but above all 
because it would form one of the principal pillars of 
Palestinian independence. We discussed various matters with Van 
Rooy, matters which must be dealt with by every country in the 
making." 
  Less sure about the Palestinian port is the leading 
professor 
of economics, Hisham Awartani, of the An-Najah University in 
Nablus on the West Bank, who has met with Dutch businessmen. He 
was a member of the Palestinian delegation which conducted the 
(temporarily suspended) economic peace talks with the Israelis 
in Paris. 
  "I do not believe that a port will be viable if it is 
designed solely to serve the expected needs of the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip," says Awartani. "Such a port must serve the 
whole region, but that would depend on the political relations 
with neighboring countries. That is why we must first carefully 
study the situation. 
  "Also, I believe that there are more urgent needs than 
having 
our own port. It is more urgent to do something about the 
miserable housing situation in the refugee camps, especially as 
we must expect foreign aid to decrease over the years. The 
international euphoria has in fact already subsided." 
  Secretary of State Van Rooy was accompanied by around 40 
Dutch businessmen; the largest business delegation from the 
Netherlands ever to have visited this part of the world.

<F P=106> [News conference by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, PLO </F>
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres with unidentified reporters at the Presidential Palace in 
Heliopolis, Cairo, on 9 February -- recorded; in English] 
  [Text] [Mubarak] We welcome the initialing of another 
Palestinian-Israeli peace document after several weeks of 
intensive negotiations. A successful conclusion of these talks 
reinforces our confidence and that all the peoples in the region 
and the prospect of comprehensive peace and full development. 
These documents initialed now eliminate several obstacles from 
the road to peace and pave the way for the signing of the accord 
agreement and the next protocol by Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, with our hope that this will take 
place in the very near future in order to bolster the structure 
of peace and stability throughout the region. 
  On the other hand, we are looking forward to the attainment 
of meaningful progress on the other track conflict. We are 
certain that this is the clear choice all parties to the 
conflict which have caused much sufferings and tragedies for 
people. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to commend both 
parties 
on their sincerity and dedication. They demonstrated their 
unwavering commitment to peace, together with their courage and 
willingness to assume the responsibility for achieving it. 
  We congratulate the Palestinian and Israeli people for their 
devotion and conviction of the necessity to make peace and put 
an end to conflict and tension. With this goodwill and mutual 
confidence, we shall be able to transform the area to a region 
of tranquility and creative initiative. Let us vow together to 
make the Cairo agreement another significant step on the road to 
peace. Thank you. [applause] 
  ['Arafat] From my heart, by the name of our people, by the 
name of our leadership, by the name of the PLO, I have to thank 
His Excellency President Mubarak for he pushed forward to 
achieve what we have signed tonight we agreed today and also the 
progress which we have already pushed even before signing our 
agreement in Washington. What we have done we can't forget and 
we will not forget in the future. 
  So again, thank you, Mr. President, from our hearts for what 
you have done. I have also to thank his Foreign Minister 
Brother 'Amr Musa for his great efforts and all the Egyptian 
staff for helping us to achieve what we have achieved. 
  We consider what we have done during the last few days a 
major step for the implementation of the DOP [Declaration of 
Principles] which we have signed in Washington, so very soon 
we'll be able to meet together in Jericho. Thank you. [applause] 
  [Peres] Mr President, Mr. Chairman, the Foreign Minister, 
ladies and gentlemen. I would like to second the thanks of 
Chairman 'Arafat to President Mubarak for the excellent support 
he is providing all the people in the Middle East to go in the 
direction of peace. Do not forget that 15 years ago, Egypt and 
Israel were hostile, were enemies, were fighting and today we 
are very proud to look up to Egypt. It is a major force in the 
Middle East to bring peace to all nations and countries. I 
thank you Mr. President for constant support and optimism in 
bringing peace to the Middle East. I would also like to thank 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa who played an extremely positive role 
in bringing us together, his intervention is always helpful and 
positive. I told the president jokingly that we came to Cairo 
[word indistinct] like the Sphinx and we are leaving Cairo 
[words indistinct] like pyramids. We did not know what will 
happen. Now we feel lthat something important did happen. 
  I know that Chairman 'Arafat has had to take some very 
difficult decisions as well as the Government of Israel and the 
prime minister of Israel and I am very glad that the tow sides 
did it. Let me say about the importance of this agreement. We 
took five or six of the most complicated issues between two 
peoples. We could go the Bosnian way: to shoot, to fight, to 
kill. Instead, we went our way: to agree, to find common 
grounds, to tell the Palestinian people and to tell the Israeli 
people that we are serious, we are credible. We are not looking 
for images and public relations. We are looking for real peace 
for all children in the Middle East, Arabs and Jews, 
Palestinians, Druze, Israelis, Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians. 
And I hope that what we did here will be significant to many 
other areas in the world. 
  As far as I put my concern, I know that the people of 
Israel are seriously and deeply interested in making peace a 
reality. I am convinced that historically and morally, they do 
not want to be the dominating force of the Palestinian people. 
They do not want that. And I know that the Palestinian people 
went through a great deal of suffering. And I know that 
Chairman 'Arafat is trying really to offer them a new future. 
It proves simply that it is very difficult to depart from a 
bitter past and offer a new horizon, to form the best 
agreements, and questions and difficulties. May I say that what 
I named the spirit of Cairo is posing itself with an encouraging 
spirit. But our peoples are decided to go ahead and make full 
peace, not just a piece of paper but a new reality for all of us. 
  We did not complete our work, but we overcame very, very 
difficult issues. And by agreement, and by negotiations, 
negotiations which were on occasions extremely difficult even 
bitter to the two sides. [Words indistinct] I know that you 
people from the press were a little bit interested in [word 
indistinct] in order to have information ahead of time. We did 
not provide you because we did not know. And for that reason, 
this evening, in this beautiful palace, in this great city of 
Cairo, is in my judgement a credible step, a new future for the 
children of all of us. Thank you very much. 
  [Unidentified reporter] One question [words indistinct]. 
  ['Arafat, in progress] ...And what has been done is a very 
important step to implement the DOP, or the papers on the 
ground. But still, we have something and we have agreed upon 
with Mr. Peres to continue through the work of our committees 
here in Cairo concerning other issues. And since that time 
another meeting will take place for the economic committee also 
to took place in Paris, to continue. And I hope, and I am sure 
that what has been done is the most important first step. And I 
have to say to all my people that we are starting this issue, 
this step, so that we will be able to overjump all our troubles. 
And we are sure that we can create now, new era for our people. 
We can say that Palestine, the meaning of Palestine, has 
returned to the map of the Middle East, since we and Mr. Rabin, 
the Israeli prime minister, had signed the recognition between 
PLO and the state of Israel, and in the same time Mr. Peres and 
Abu-Mazin signed the agreement under the auspices of President 
Clinton in the White House. We have to thank also Mr. Rabin, 
the Israeli prime minister, for his strong support and active 
support until we have the opportunity to achieve what we have 
achieved today. Thank you. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Chairman, when do you plan to come to Jericho 
and first to sign the agreement, the final agreement, with Prime 
Minister Rabin of Israel? 
  ['Arafat] I hope, this will depend on the next committees, 
and I hope that it will be very soon. And also under the 
auspices of President Mubarak we will have it very soon here in 
Cairo. I hope so. 
  [Reporter] What are the issues that are still in trouble. I 
mean what are the points that are still in friction. 
  ['Arafat] Actions speak louder. Let actions speak. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Peres, could you speak [words indistinct]. 
  [Peres] First of all, I would like to thank the team of the 
Israelis and the team of the Palestinians. The chairman and 
myself spoke that they were really working and I think I am 
obliged and privileged to express [words indistinct] we went 
over some of the most difficult [words indistinct]. We met with 
the Austrian president in [word indistinct] in Austria and 
Germany. The four cars take four persons, four policemen, and a 
Jeep. And then I asked them who was your enemy. If you don't 
have an enemy, you cannot put four persons on a Jeep. But when 
you have enemies, they would shoot them to kill. It is a 
different order. And I think that the chairman and us are 
interested in putting an end to it. 
  We have agreed on Gaza. We have agreed on the distribution 
of security and administration and dignity. I think both sides 
made a supreme effort. I think we solved most of the problems. 
Some of them will be dealt with in Taba because, you know the 
documents we signed are two. One is new pages on principles 
which is called the Cairo document and the old pages on the 
passages and the management in Jericho and in Gaza. The other 
of the two involving programs [words indistinct] the people of 
Taba. Taba is not a name, Taba is a way of thinking and Gaza is 
the same [words indistinct] all the problems which were before 
us were solved either completely [word indistinct] or the 
principles [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct]. 
  [Peres] Yes. We dealt with these problems and I think most 
of them were solved amicably. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Peres] I am sure that neither Chairman 'Arafat nor Prime 
Minister Rabin will remain unemployed people. They still have 
some jobs to do, you know. 
  [Reporter] President Mubarak, when do you think you might be 
able to host a similar meeting between the Israeli prime 
minister and the Syrian president? 
  [Mubarak] I hope that this could happen soon. But all what 
I could tell you about this point I am very optimistic for 
reaching a comprehensive settlement between Israel and Syria and 
even Israel and Jordan. So, this is on our concern. Then after 
that, whenever this process moves forward it will be easy for 
anybody to do the other one. There's no problem. We should 
concentrate our efforts on reaching an agreement with the other 
parties so as peace prevails which is very important, very 
vital, for the whole people all over the area. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Peres, Foreign Minister Peres, could you 
please tell us how you have assured Israel's security by this 
agreement? Some of the details by which you have assured the 
security of Israel? 
  [Peres] I think that it all began in Cairo. Chairman 
'Arafat said that he will respect the security needs of Israel 
[words indistinct] and surely we cannot compromise on our 
security. We insisted that we have security measures. In other 
words, we have announced that we shall do whatever we can to 
introduce an air of dignity and respect for the Palestinian 
people. And from our side we tried to do it as much as we can. 
Occasionally, it wasn't simple, because what we call security, 
the Palestinians call dignity and what the Palestinians call 
dignity, we call security. So in names it is easier to do than 
problems to solve. But, I am very glad that we have solved all 
things this way. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Peres. You have said that you've come very 
close to actually solving it. Can you actually tell us what the 
solution is on three of the issues: Gaza, Jericho, and the 
third one. What is the actual solution that you have come to? 
What have you signed tonight? 
  [Peres] We shall make known the agreement and you will have 
to read many pages. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct]. 
  [Peres] On what? 
  [Reporter] What is the size of Jericho? 
  [Peres] We have agreed on the passages as I have said. We 
have agreed on the arrangements in Gaza, and there will be 
actually three different zones. We have agreed on the size of 
Jericho. The final size will be decided between Chairman 
'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin when they meet. And, but, we 
have agreed on the other components of it. We have agreed on 
the security arrangements. We have agreed on the Palestinian 
authority, how they can run their own affairs without any 
intervention from outside. And we went over a very long list of 
problems. The real problem before us, for the Palestinians and 
the Israelis, is this is an unprecedented move. We cannot learn 
from anybody else. We cannot go to the library and take a book 
or a magazine and say here we are going to [word indistinct]. 
Every solution we have had to adopt was a precedented 
solution. That would be a good [words indistinct]. 
  The hopes I believe, of the Palestinians, of us, and our 
children is that the reality is even better than the [words 
indistinct]. We intend very seriously to give a very good 
relations between the Palestinians and ourselves so that papers 
will not be needed at all. In order to build relations we need 
the papers. But if we shall have relations, we shall not need 
the papers. Thank you.

  [Text] Foreign ambassadors and representatives of foreign 
diplomatic missions and international organizations in Iran 
today were received by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Our 
reporter sent us this report: 
  [Unidentified reporter] During the meeting, the president 
said that the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
based on strengthening friendship and cooperation and the 
establishment of friendly relations with all countries, with the 
exception of the regime occupying Jerusalem and America. He 
said: We are strongly against regional crises and wars, and we 
are prepared to cooperate with international organizations and 
peace-loving nations of the world in order to eliminate centers 
of crisis. 
  Condemning America's hostile policy toward Iran, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: America has never been able to 
comprehend the realities of the Islamic revolution of Iran and 
is still living in the past when she regarded herself the master 
of this country. Therefore, the Iranian people will confront 
America's hostile policies with firmness and strength and will 
never compromise with that kind of thinking. 
  He described the regime occupying Jerusalem as an 
illegitimate and imposed regime and added: Israel is not seeking 
a peace that guarantees the legitimate rights of the oppressed 
Palestinian people. One cannot support the so-called peace 
talks as long as the destiny of millions of Palestinian refugees 
is not clarified. 
  The president described the victory of the Islamic 
revolution 
of Iran in 1979 as being due to the justice seeking and 
antityrannical attitude of the Iranian people. He said: If we 
are witnessing the deterioration of values and principles and of 
human and international norms in many parts of the world today, 
this is due to deviations from the pure and peace-loving nature 
of the nations of the world. 
  Enumerating examples of corruption and injustice during the 
era of Iran's former lackey regime, its collusion with unjust 
international policies, and its dependent foreign policy, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: All members of Iranian society--with 
unprecedented unity and through reliance upon the call of their 
spiritual nature [fetrat] and by following the wise leadership 
of their religious leader--rose up against tyranny and 
injustice. They have paid a very heavy price thus far in order 
to achieve victory and to safeguard their gains. They are also 
prepared to continue paying the price of their independence and 
freedom in the future. 
  Referring to the progress made by the Islamic Republic of 
Iran during the era of reconstruction, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: 
A serious effort is continuing in Iran to reconstruct and repair 
all of the losses inflicted and the backwardness. The most 
important engineering projects and basic measures--including 
roads, power generators, ports, transportation, railways, the 
discovery and transfer of oil and gas, and agriculture--are 
being implemented with great speed by the hands of domestic 
experts and by using domestic equipment and material. Great 
success has already been achieved in these fields. 
  Referring to regional and international crises, especially 
the bitter and painful events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
president criticized the positions of international 
organizations. He said: Despite the readiness of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to send 10,000 peacekeeping forces to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, this offer was rejected with the excuse of 
maintaining impartiality. At the moment, the Serbs are free to 
commit any crime, and the world stops at only condemning these 
crimes. 
  He stressed: The required seriousness toward defending 
oppressed peoples does not exist in the centers of power in the 
world. One should expect all the governments and nations to 
hold hands and to prevent so much tyranny and injustice. 
  Addressing the foreign ambassadors, diplomatic 
representatives, and delegations from international 
organizations based in Iran, Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed: I ask 
you--as representatives who live in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and witness our people's political and cultural maturity, as 
well as our country's development and progress--to fulfill what 
we expect from you. I ask you to convey the realities to the 
people of your respective countries, thereby making the world 
public aware of these realities. In this way, the foundations 
for establishing international and regional peace and stability 
will be laid down. 
  The president then referred to the loyalty of the people of 
Iran to the Islamic revolution and to the continued presence of 
the nation in different arenas. He said: You, as foreign 
diplomats based in Tehran, will witness the extensive presence 
of the various strata of people in the rallies tomorrow, 11 
February. You will witness that even after the passage of 15 
years, and despite enduring difficulties and hardship brought 
about by the imposed war and the process of reconstruction, our 
people are not prepared to allow the realities of their lives to 
be brought under the influence of negative and disheartening 
rumors and insinuations. He added: This shows the people's 
awareness and maturity on the one hand, and the failure of the 
imperialist media in attaining their inauspicious objectives, on 
the other hand. 
  According to a Central News Unit report, before remarks by 
the president, the ambassador of the Arab Republic of Libya [as 
heard] in Tehran spoke on behalf of the ambassadors as their 
doyen. During the course of his remarks, he congratulated the 
eminent leader, the president, and the revolutionary and 
liberated nation of Iran on the anniversary of the victory of 
the Islamic revolution. He said: We pay our respects to the 
lofty status of the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
the revered martyrs who sacrificed their lives for Iran's 
independence and freedom. We convey our respect to the blessed 
souls of these dear ones and hope that the Islamic Republic 
system and the heroic nation of Iran may always be able to 
achieve progress and success in reconstruction and development. 
The Libyan ambassador then condemned the plot to assassinate 
the president of our country and wished him health and success. 
  On the basis of this report, at the end of this audience, 
the 
ambassadors, diplomats, and the Iran-based representatives of 
foreign countries and international organizations held separate 
meetings with the president. During the course of their brief 
exchanges, they expressed their congratulations on the 
anniversary of victory of the Islamic revolution.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Suspected Islamic militants 
late Tuesday shot dead a plainclothes policeman and wounded 
three civilians outside a mosque in the southern Egyptian city 
of Asyut, police reported. 
  They said the assailants opened fire with automatic weapons 
on Officer Mahmud Ahmad as he left a mosque, adding that three 
civilians who were also leaving the building were hit as well. 
  Police launched a search of the area but the gunmen managed 
to flee. 
  The Asyut region, located 900 kilometers (600 miles) south 
of 
Cairo, has been the scene of frequent confrontations between 
security forces and Moslem militants seeking to overthrow the 
secular government of President Husni Mubarak. 
  According to an unofficial toll compiled by AFP from police 
sources, 297 people have been killed in the clashes -- including 
108 policemen and 95 fundamentalists -- since the unrest erupted 
in March 1992.

  [Text] Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khudayyir this evening 
received Asif Zardari, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's 
personal envoy to leader President Saddam Husayn, and his 
delegation. During the meeting, the prime minister received a 
written message from Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutti for 
leader President Saddam Husayn on relations between the two 
friendly countries. 
  The prime minister said that relations between Iraq and 
Pakistan were close and developed, especially with Pakistani 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, as well as between the two 
friendly peoples. He stressed the determination to promote 
these relations in light of the longstanding history of good 
relations in the interest of the two Muslim peoples. He added 
that leader President Saddam Husayn is interested in promoting 
bilateral relations in all fields in the interest of the two 
peoples. 
  The prime minister stressed that the circumstances 
experienced by Iraq are transient, that the unjust blockade will 
be removed, and that Iraq will recover. 
  The prime minister reviewed the reconstruction campaign of 
the installations that were destroyed by the 30-state 
aggression, the gigantic new projects implemented over the past 
three years, and the great expertise the Iraqis have acquired as 
a result of their self-reliance in the implementation of these 
projects. 
  Asif Zardari, Benazir Bhutto's personal envoy to leader 
President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him, said: I am 
carrying good wishes to leader President Saddam Husayn and the 
Iraqi government and people from the Pakistani prime minister 
and people. My visit expresses the good intentions of the 
Pakistani people toward the Iraqi people and leadership in light 
of the close bilateral relations. 
  He expressed admiration for Iraq's reconstruction experiment 
and ability to implement new projects under the current 
circumstances. He stressed the Pakistani Government's desire to 
promote bilateral relations in all fields and to benefit from 
both sides' technical expertise. 
  The meeting was attended by Hamid Salih al-Rawi, head of the 
Council of Ministers' secretariat and Foreign Ministry under 
secretary, and the Pakistani ambassador in Baghdad.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says Israel has 
suggested that Syria upgrade its negotiating team by sending its 
foreign minister, rather that what he termed the Foreign 
Ministry pensioner. 
  In reply to a question on whether secret contacts were being 
held with Syria, the prime minister said that some things should 
be probed secretly before the sides make public commitments. 
This was how things had been done in the negotiations with 
Egypt, as well as in those with the PLO. 
  Responding to a question on whether 'Arafat had requested 
that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] activity in the territories 
be curtailed, Yitzhaq Rabin said various requests had been 
submitted, but nothing has been promised. He maintained that 
the problem lay in people's focusing on gestures, rather than 
the agreement itself. 
  Our correspondent Qaysar Qabaha reports that the prime 
minister made these remarks in an interview with Nazareth's 
AL-SINARAH weekly.

<F P=106> [By Chandan Mitra] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 26 -- The Americans have a 
down-to-earth way of expressing incredulity when a person says 
something bizarre. They simply ask, "Is this man for real?" 
Washington- watchers in India are beginning to wonder whether 
the question isn't apt for the President of the United States 
himself. 
  The worrisome aspect of the scandal-prone Mr. Clinton, whose 
policies abroad have been stumbling from one banana peel to 
another, is that he is no longer merely simulating 
India-bashing. It would be dangerously naive to ascribe his 
weird words and deeds on South Asian subjects to his fabled 
ignorance and immaturity in foreign affairs. The succession of 
provocative remarks on Kashmir by Mr. John Mallot, Ms. Robin 
Raphel and the President himself have never been retracted. The 
clarifications that have followed India's protests have only 
elaborated them further, confirming that the original assertions 
were fully intended. 
  Take the latest calumny on Punjab for instance. Who accused 
Mr. Clinton of having supported the idea of Khalistan? He 
didn't say it, nor was he charged with saying it. Yet, 
Washington has vociferously denied that the U.S. President had 
provided tacit support to the cause of an independent Khalistan. 
A Freudian slip there? 
  The U.S. clarification, however, makes it perfectly clear 
that the Clinton Administration will determinedly pursue the 
cause of "minority rights" in India. The "helpful" 
clarification patronisingly emphasises that minorities in India 
ought to have the same rights as the others. 
  Mr. Clinton would probably be shell-shocked to learn that 
unlike the U.S., minorities in India not only have but also 
exercise with gusto the same rights as the majority. 
  It was, therefore, in the fitness of things that India's 
most 
respected Sikh today, the Director-General of Punjab Police, Mr. 
K.P.S. Gill, who has made the greatest contribution to the 
return of normalcy in that State, was the first to ridicule the 
U.S. President's observation. 
  Significantly, Mr. Gill's co-religionist, Youth Congress 
president Maninderjit Singh Bitta, is organising an all-Sikh 
demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi to protest 
against Mr. Clinton's gratuitous observations. Such expressions 
of outrage by the Sikhs, who are the sword-arm of Indian 
civilisation, is the most appropriate response to Washington's 
mischief-making. 
  According to sources in the Ministry of External Affairs, 
the 
Government, on the other hand, is not keen to react too 
vigorously to Mr. Clinton's latest missive. "We have to learn 
to live with the immaturity of the present U.S. Administration", 
said a senior MEA [Ministry of External Affairs] official in a 
resigned tone. 
  Pointing out that Indo-U.S. relations have witnessed many 
ups 
and downs over the last four decades, the official underlined 
that it was during the Reagan and Bush tenure that New Delhi had 
reached a most satisfactory political understanding with 
Washington. 
  "The irony is that today, India's relations with the U.S. in 
every other sphere, especially in the economic arena, are 
excellent. It is tragic that we seem to be on different 
wavelengths on political issues," he added. Indian officials 
believe that an ill- informed U.S. President is being guided in 
his South Asia policy almost solely by a very junior official, 
his Oxford-mate Ms. Robin Raphel, whose personal predilections 
have lent a definite tilt towards Pakistan. The stuffing of the 
State Department's South Asia Desk with several officers who 
have served in Pakistan is only enhancing the U.S. bias, New 
Delhi feels. 
  South Block mandarins are also at pains to point out that 
contrary to the obtuse angularities of the Raphelites, the 
approach of senior U.S. officials like Mr. Peter Tarnoff has 
been very different. Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit established 
an excellent rapport with Mr. Tarnoff during his visits to 
Washington. But, sadly for India, it is Ms. Raphel who appears 
to have Mr. Clinton's ear. What amazes officials here is that 
the holder of the world's most powerful office has taken it upon 
himself to reply to letters from all and sundry. At the height 
of the Khalistan movement, several wealthy expatriate sponsors 
of terrorism used to write similar letters to Presidents Reagan 
and Bush. But they sent back only terse official 
acknowledgements, without bothering to pen elaborate, 
provocative replies like Mr. Clinton. 
  One explanation being offered for the U.S. President's 
letter 
to Congressman Gary A. Condit on "Sikh rights" is that Mr. 
Clinton is in desperate need for Congressional support at the 
moment. The Whitewatergate scandal is showing no signs of 
abating and fresh revelations of Mr. Clinton's alleged sexual 
peccadillos during his tenure as Governor of Arkansas, have left 
him highly vulnerable. 
  Demands for a Congressional inquiry into his alleged land 
deals and private life are snowballing. Recently, the inquiry 
demand has become bi-partisan and the President's own party, the 
Democrats, have joined the chorus. 
  Some U.S. Congressmen are well-known lobbyists for various 
secessionist outfits and often champion all kinds of dubious 
causes for a consideration. Being on the payroll of 
organisations like the "Council of Khalistan" etc., these 
Congressmen are expected to canvass their patrons' interests. 
In his present beleaguered state, President Clinton can hardly 
afford to antagonise any Congressman, even if his "cause" is 
suspect. Thus, if a few words of encouragement give a 
Congressman some pecuniary benefits, Mr. Clinton probably feels 
it is worth it. The larger international ramifications 
evidently do not bother him. At any rate, since India's-bashing 
is now state policy, such replies do not go against the 
diplomatic philosophy of the U.S. Administration either. 
  Keeping these exigencies in mind, India appears to have 
decided against rising to Mr. Clinton's bait, at least for the 
present. New Delhi has conveyed its strong feelings on the 
subject to Washington through its Ambassador, Mr. Siddhartha 
Shankar Ray, and does not intend to pursue the matter any more. 
  But there is all-round dismay that President Clinton's and 
Ms. Raphel's ill-considered statements are periodically boosting 
the morale of terrorists in Kashmir and the handful still left 
in Punjab. Ironically, the very same Administration which 
frequently goes into a tizzy over the "terrorism" of Libya's 
Colonel Gaddafi and Somalia's General Aideed, is now directly 
responsible for fomenting terrorist depredations in democratic 
India. 
  But then, neither consistency, nor even adherence to self- 
proclaimed lofty principles of freedom, democracy and human 
rights, have ever been hallmarks of U.S. foreign policy.

<F P=106> [By Sanjeev Miglani] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi--Pakistan may well resort to a military 
option against India, according to the threat perception of the 
Defence Ministry. 
  The "threat assessment" paper, released at a recent meeting 
of the consultative committee attached to the Defence Ministry, 
has drawn attention to the massive Pakistani military build up 
in recent years and termed it serious. Describing Pakistan as a 
major military threat, the note warns: "Its internal compulsions 
and the narrowing edge (of the Pakistani forces) vis-a-vis our 
armed forces may tempt it to resort to a military option at an 
opportune time. This could come about if it perceives India to 
be weak-willed and embroiled in internal turmoil.' 
  The Defence Ministry points out that from the 1987 peak 
budgetary allocation for the Indian armed forces has been 
declining in real terms every year. lt warns that economic 
measures cannot be continued indefinitely without leading to 
adverse effects on the capability of the Army. 
  Pakistan is spending 7 per cent of its gross domestic 
product 
(GDP) on defence, as against India's 2.5 per cent. The country's 
armed forces have been consistently inducting modern equipment 
and expanding their numbers, the note stresses. After acquiring 
300 tanks from China. Pakistan is now shopping for more from the 
UK, France and other countries. It has increased its anti-tank 
capability with the induction of anti-tank missiles from China. 
  Similar acquisitions have been reported for Pakistani army 
aviation artillery, air defence artillery engineer and infantry 
units, the note says. It draws attention to the induction of 
surface-to-surface missiles with a range of approximately 300 
kms, again purchased from China. 
  Force levels of the Pakistan army have gone up sharply with 
induction of two armoured brigades, four infantry brigades, two 
artillery divisions and one surface-to-surface missile brigade. 
Future plans of the army include induction of such force 
multipliers as electronic warfare capability, induction of AWACS 
[Airborne Warning and Control System], raising of army aviation 
units and specialised troops like "ski-troops" for Siachen 
operations. To top everything, it acquired nuclear capability. 
  The Defence ministry's threat perception on China is far 
less 
serious in the wake of the gradual warming of Sino-lndian 
relations. The Ministry feels China is unlikely to disturb 
status quo along the Indo-Tibetan border -- at least till the 
turn of the century. 
  However, it notes that China's stepped-up arms sales to 
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar [Burma] are an attempt to gain 
a strategic foothold in the South-East region. Among the 
activities of China which have a direct bearing on the security 
environment in the Indian sub-continent is the whopping increase 
in its defence budget -- 14.8 per cent--thus allowing for rapid 
modernisation. A Rapid Reaction Force has been created in each 
of China's military regions. A final point of concern -- the 
country has upgraded its military infrastructure in Tibet, 
setting up vital communication channels. 
  Above everything else is China's comprehensive and full 
indigenous nuclear programme. The major elements of her nuclear 
arsenal include a stockpile of nuclear devices, multiple 
independent recovery vehicle capability, delivery systems, 
surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, satellite communications 
and surveillance capability. 
  In her quest for superpower status, China is building up her 
economy, not only in the areas of agriculture, industry and 
science but also her defence structure, according to the Defence 
Ministry perception. In the regional context China expects tc 
play a dominating role -- initially in the Pacific Rim, 
gradually extending it to South East Asia and the Indian Ocean.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the public relations branch of the </F>
Internal Security Forces Directorate; date not given] 
  [Text] At 0930 on 29 January, Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah, 
first secretary at the Jordanian Embassy in Beirut, was 
assassinated in front of his home in Australia Street, Beirut. 
Immediately afterward, all the units of the internal security 
forces were instructed by Major General Rafiq al-Hasan, director 
general of the internal security forces, to immediately carry 
out investigations and gather information on the criminals 
before they are arrested and handed over to the Judiciary. 
  On the night of 4 February, Staff Brigadier General Salim 
Salim, commander of the Judiciary Police Corps, obtained 
information that a Palestinian person called Yusuf Mahmud 
Sha'ban, whose nom de guerre is Wa'il Mahmud 'Ali, is the 
perpetrator or the instigator or implicated and involved in this 
incident. Coordination between the Lebanese Security Service 
and the Syrian military intelligence branch of the Syrian Arab 
Forces in Lebanon led to the arrest of Yusuf Mahmud Sha'ban. 
  The judiciary was informed of developments. It issued 
instructions for the start of investigations, which were carried 
out by Staff Colonel Mahmud al-Rida, head of the special 
criminal intelligence branch, and Lieutenant Colonel 'Ali 
al-Sha'ir, head of the antiterrorism bureau. The investigations 
were supervised by the commander of the Judiciary Police Corps. 
  In light of the coordination, three perpetrators involved in 
the incident were detained. All of them are Palestinians. The 
investigations have revealed that the killer is Yusuf Mahmud 
Sha'ban, alias Wa'il, who was aided by the three detained and 
others who are still at large. 
  The internal security forces, coordinating with the other 
Lebanese security services and the Syrian intelligence branch of 
the Syrian Forces in Lebanon, continue to make diligent efforts 
to find and arrest the other perpetrators and refer them to the 
judiciary.

  [Text] Yusuf Mahmud Sha'ban, who was said yesterday to be 
the assassin of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, belongs 
to the Abu-Nidal organization [Fatah Revolutionary Council, 
FRC]. This report was confirmed today by a high-ranking 
security source, who said the murderer and three other 
Palestinians, suspected of being his accomplices in the 
assassination, are members of the FRC led by Sabri al-Banna, 
alias Abu-Nidal. The source said that the four individuals 
admitted that they are members of the FRC. 
  REUTER cited Brigadier General Staff Salim Salim, commander 
of the judicial police, as saying that the latest investigation 
into the case revealed that one of the three suspects is a 
woman, who is more of a witness than an accomplice to the crime. 
He noted that at first she declined to give particular 
information but did so later. The judiciary will determine the 
fate of each suspect. Security sources said the Palestinian 
detainees have been placed under strict security guard for fear 
that they might be attacked in jail. 
  President Ilyas al-Hirawi informed King Husayn of Jordan 
last 
night that the Lebanese authorities have apprehended the 
Jordanian diplomat's killer. He said the law will take its 
course.

Barajinah [south Beirut] was revealed yesterday. Judge Nasri 
Lahhud, the government's representative at the Military 
Tribunal, has indicted the Palestinian Ghalib Husayn al-Jamal, 
currently in custody, on the charge of training individuals to 
carry out terrorist operations and manufacture the necessary 
explosives for such activity. Al-Jamal opened a school in Burj 
al-Barajinah, calling it the Academy of Terrorist Operations. 
He charged $50 for each lesson. 
  Judge Lahhud also indicted al-Jamal's brother-in-law, Mahmud 
al-Zu'bi, currently at large, for supplying al-Jamal with 
terrorist trainees over a period of four months. He referred 
the case to the military prosecutor.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Israel Refuses To Return the 
Occupied Territories," the newspaper TISHRIN discusses the 
outcome of the Cairo agreement recently signed between the PLO 
and Israel. The paper explains that Israel has once again 
confirmed that it does not want a just and comprehensive peace, 
nor does it want to return the occupied Arab territories to 
their owners. 
  TISHRIN says: What was accomplished in Oslo and what 
happened in Cairo clearly shows that Israel is focusing on 
separate deals and partial procedures designed to guarantee its 
security and tighten its control of the situation in the 
occupied territories. Moreover, Israel wants a partner to join 
it in protecting its security under the slogan of repressing 
terrorism. Rabin pointed to this issue in statements, carried 
on Israeli radio, during a meeting held by the Labor Party in 
Tel Aviv after the Cairo agreement was signed. Rabin said this 
agreement will allow Israel to repress terrorism. Rabin added: 
We can only do so if we have a partner who realizes that he 
cannot achieve his objectives if our security is not guaranteed. 
It is in our interest that this partner should take our 
security concerns into consideration. 
  TISHRIN asserts that Rabin's remarks do not need any 
comment. 
It adds: These remarks, however, show that Israel still 
adheres to all its pretexts and delusions, and places the Cairo 
agreement in its real context; namely, this agreement is a new 
gain for Israel. 
  The paper continues: All the Israeli statements that 
welcomed this agreement apparently indicate that the Rabin 
government will continue its policy of shirking the requirements 
of a just and comprehensive peace, that it will continue its 
subversive efforts to undermine the formula of the Madrid 
conference, and that Israel will keep pursuing a policy in 
conflict with the bases of a just and comprehensive peace. 
Otherwise, what is the meaning of the Israeli insistence that 
this agreement is a precedent for separate deals? What is the 
meaning of Israel's refusal to seriously deal with the bases of 
the Madrid conference and the resolutions of international 
legitimacy? These resolutions call for full Israeli withdrawal 
from the occupied Arab territories and for returning the 
territories in exchange for peace. 
  TISHRIN adds: We pose all these questions in order to 
emphasize that peace cannot be achieved or maintained unless 
there is a just, comprehensive, and balanced solution whose 
approaches and objectives take into account the regaining of all 
Arab territories and rights. Israel is fully aware that partial 
settlements and separate deals cannot make peace. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Thus, these agreements cannot be 
an alternative to a real, just, and comprehensive peace. Both 
the world and the international community's will were unanimous 
in demanding, with clear and unequivocal resolutions, a peace 
that cannot be subjected to procrastination. Based on these 
resolutions, the Madrid conference was held, and the principles 
and elements of peace were crystallized. Also based on these 
resolutions, the terms of reference and objectives of such a 
peace were determined; namely, Israel's full withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories first and foremost.

  [Text] Under the headline "The Achievement of Just and 
Comprehensive Peace is an International Responsibility," the 
newspaper AL-BA'TH editorial says: Many world capitals are 
taking a special interest in the current Middle East situation. 
This interest seems to be prompted by fears over the possible 
collapse of the peace process, which was viewed by the world as 
a unique opportunity for the achievement of just and 
comprehensive peace that would spare the region the calamities 
of war and provide it with security and stability, one that 
would not come again. 
  The paper adds: The world community is unanimous that a 
durable peace must begin with an Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories, because this would consecrate 
international legitimacy. This is a must if the requirements of 
peace are to be met. It goes without saying that meeting these 
requirements would help the peace process achieve its 
objectives, which are enshrined in the relevant UN resolutions. 
  The paper notes the working paper Syria submitted to the 
Israeli negotiators during the sixth round of the Washington 
bilateral talks, which was appreciated by the world community 
and deemed a positive step forward. The world community 
believes that if heeded, this paper would help achieve true 
peace in the region. However, Israel, which was pressured into 
attending the Madrid conference in the first place, has declined 
to discuss the article pertaining to withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories, and raised issues that should have 
been raised only after rather than before the withdrawal is 
completed. 
  The paper goes on to say: Israel's position on this issue 
has to date remained unchanged. For, the Rabin government has 
continued to make impossible and unacceptable demands. The 
developments in the peace process over the past two years have 
revealed to the world which party is working to achieve just and 
comprehensive peace, and which is working to thwart this noble 
objective. 
  In this regard, the paper notes the reaffirmation made by 
Douglas Hogg, British minister of state at the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office, regarding the need to achieve a just and 
comprehensive regional settlement, affirming that there can be 
no peace in the region unless Syria restores its sovereignty 
over the Golan. 
  AL-BA'TH says: If this is indicative of anything, it is of 
the entire world community's convictions that if peace is to be 
achieved in the region, Israel must implement the relevant UN 
resolutions, which provide for complete and full withdrawal from 
the occupied Arab territories. 
  Concluding its editorial, the paper says: The world 
community, which is taking a special interest in achieving a 
just regional settlement, is required, now more than ever 
before, to take a firmer and more serious position to achieve 
just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  In one of its commentaries, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
addresses the same issue, saying: Undoubtedly, the world 
community is fully convinced that Israel has continued to 
obstruct the efforts aimed at achieving just and comprehensive 
peace, the peace that is grounded in the relevant international 
legitimacy resolutions, and that would achieve security, 
stability, and prosperity in the region. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes the difficulties and obstacles the Israeli 
Government has created to obstruct the peace process and prevent 
it from achieving any accomplishment that could promote the 
cause of peace and stability in the Middle East through the 
pursuit of a policy based on evasion and procrastination to 
evade any clear commitment to the requirements of peace, as 
enshrined in international legitimacy resolutions. Israel has 
repeatedly and deliberately stepped up violence, repression, and 
terrorism in both the occupied Arab territories and Lebanon to 
provoke the Arabs and make them abandon the peace process. 
  The paper adds: Nonetheless, recent developments have 
undoubtedly shown that Israel has failed to achieve its 
objectives in this regard. Had it not been for the patience, 
wisdom, and prudence demonstrated by the Arabs when confronted 
with Israel's maneuvers and games, the peace process would have 
collapsed. The positive stands the Arabs have taken toward the 
peace process and their honest favorable response to the efforts 
made to activate the bilateral talks have enlightened the world 
community in general and the United States in particular with 
regard to peace process issues. These stands have prompted the 
world community and the United States to conclude that it is the 
Arabs who are honest in their peace efforts, that they are 
working to achieve durable and true peace, and that they are the 
party that respects international legitimacy and clings to its 
resolutions and laws. What the Arabs are demanding is only that 
the principles of right and justice be upheld. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: In contrast to this positive Arab 
stand, Israel has been exposed to the world community as an 
aggressive occupation power that does not care about peace. Its 
peace stand is tailored to promote its ambitions and objectives. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: The bilateral 
talks will be resumed in Washington at the chief delegates' 
level within days. The achievement of progress in these talks 
requires a drastic change in the Israeli negotiating positions. 
It also requires a reconsideration on Israel's part of many of 
its flawed perceptions and views regarding the nature of the 
solution required for the region. 
  Under the headline "Israeli Threats," the newspaper TISHRIN 
says: Israel has revived the policy of threats and intimidation 
against the Arabs of the occupied Arab territories, deriving 
strength from the Cairo agreement signed by 'Arafat and Peres. 
This agreement has granted Israel complete control over 
security affairs. These threats are coming even before the ink 
used to sign this agreement has dried. Israel has stepped up 
its terrorist and repressive policy against the Arabs of the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, and warned that collective punitive 
measures will be escalated if the resistance and 
intifadah-related activities are continued, and if the 
condemnations and denunciations of the Cairo agreement continue 
to be made. 
  The paper adds: What Israel is saying is that aggressive and 
terrorist military force could be used to ensure the 
implementation of the Cairo agreement. Israel, before others, 
is aware that this agreement has nothing to do with peace, and 
that it cannot be called a move toward achieving just and 
comprehensive peace. 
  The paper maintains that the Cairo agreement has ensured 
Israel a powerful partner in accomplishing the so-called 
security missions, and in protecting settlements. The agreement 
has granted Israel the authority to pursue suspects. 
  Concluding its commentary, the paper says: Partial measures 
and separate deals could only aggravate the situation. They 
will create a state of open war in the occupied territories. 
The developments that we have seen in the aftermath of the Oslo 
accord and the Cairo deal are testimony to all that we are 
saying.

verification that such passengers hold the necessary 
documentation for exiting the area to Jordan or Egypt, as set 
out in this Agreement. 
  3. Arrangements for Entry from Egypt and Jordan Through the 
Palestinian Wing 
  a. At the entrance to the Palestinian wing there will be a 
Palestinian policeman and a raised Palestinian flag. 
  b. Before entering the Palestinian wing, passengers will 
identify their personal luggage and it will be place on a 
conveyor belt. Each side will be able to inspect such luggage 
inside its own checking area using its own personnel and, if 
necessary, may open the luggage for inspection in the presence 
of the owner and a Palestinian policeman. 
  c. Persons entering the Palestinian wing will pass through a 
magnetic gate. An Israeli policeman and a Palestinian policeman 
will be posted on each side of this gate. In the event of 
suspicion, each side will be entitled to require a physical 
inspection to be conducted in inspection booths to be located 
adjacent to the gate. Passengers will be inspected by a 
Palestinian policeman in the presence of an Israeli policeman. 
Accompanying personal belongings may also be inspected at this 
point. 
  d. Having completed the above phase, person entering the 
Palestinian wing will pass through one of three lanes for the 
purpose of identification and document control, as follows: 
(1) The first lane will be used by Palestinian residents 
of the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, these passengers will pass 
via a Palestinian counter, where their documents and identity 
will be checked. Their documents will be checked by an Israeli 
officer who will also check their identity indirectly in an 
invisible manner. 
(2) The second lane will serve other Palestinian residents 
of the West Bank. These passengers will first pass via a 
Palestinian counter, where their documents and identity will be 
checked. Then they will continue via an Israeli counter, where 
their documents and identity will be checked. The two counters 
will be separated by tinted glass and a revolving door. 
(3) The third lane will serve visitors to the Gaza Strip 
and West Bank. An identical procedure as in paragraph 3.d.(2) 
above will apply to such visitors, except that they will first 
pass via the Israel counter and then continue via the 
Palestinian counter. 
  e. In the event of suspicion regarding a passenger in any 
of the three lanes described in paragraph d. above each side may 
question such passenger in its closed checking area. Suspicion 
justifying questioning in the closed checking area may be one of 
the following: 
(1) the passenger was involved, directly or indirectly, in 
criminal or planned criminal activity, in terrorist or planned 
terrorist activity and is not a beneficiary of the amnesty 
provisions of this agreement. 
(2) the passenger conceals arms, explosives, or related 
equipment. 
(3) the passenger holds forged or non-valid documentation 
or the details included in the documentation are inconsistent 
with those included in the population registry (in case of 
residence) or in the data base (in case of of a visitor), except 
that questions relating to such inconsistency will initially be 
raised at the counter and the passenger will be questioned in 
the closed checking area only if the suspicion has not been 
removed, or 
(4) the passenger acts in an obviously suspicious behavior 
during the passage via the terminal. 
  If, at the conclusion of this questioning, the suspicion 
has not been removed, such passenger may be apprehended, after 
the other side has been notified. In case of a Palestinian 
suspect being apprehended by the Israeli side, a Palestinian 
policeman will be asked to meet with the suspect. Following 
notification to the liaison bureau, any further treatment of the 
apprehended person will be in accordance with Annex III 
(Protocol Concerning Legal Arrangements in Criminal Matters). 
  f. In the Palestinian wing, each side will have the 
authority to deny the entry of persons who are not residents of 
the Gaza Strip and West Bank. 
  For the purpose of this Agreement, "residents of the Gaza 
Strip and West Bank" shall mean persons who, on the date of 
entry into force of this Agreement, are registered as residents 
of these areas in the population registry maintained by the 
military government of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, as well as 
persons who have subsequently obtained permanent residency in 
these areas with the approval of Israel, as set out in this 
Agreement. 
  g. Following the above procedure, the passengers will 
collect their luggage and proceed to the customs area. (The 
procedures will be agreed upon in Paris). 
  h. The Palestinian side will provide passengers whose entry 
is approved with an entry permit stamped by the Palestinian side 
and attached to their documents. 
  At the conclusion of the direct and indirect checking of 
passengers passing via the first lane and stamping their entry 
permits, the Palestinian officer will provide the passenger with 
a white card issued by the Israeli officer. A Palestinian 
official posted at the exit of the Palestinian wing will verify 
that the passenger holds such a white card and will collect the 
cards with indirectly an invisible Israeli checking. 
  For passengers going through the second and third lanes, the 
Israeli officer will provide the passengers with a blue card, 
after checking their documents and identity, and verifying their 
entry permits. An Israeli and a Palestinian official posted at 
the exit of the Palestinian wing will verify and collect the 
cards. White and blue cards collected will be checked by 
Israeli and Palestinian officials. 
  In cases where either side denies the entry of a 
non-resident 
passenger, that passenger will be escorted out of the terminal 
and sent back to Jordan or Egypt, as appropriate, after 
notifying the other side. 
  4. Arrangements for Exit to Egypt and Jordan Through the 
Palestinian Wing 
  Passengers exiting to Egypt or Jordan through the 
Palestinian 
wing will enter the terminal without their luggage. Thereafter, 
the same procedures described in paragraph 3 above will apply to 
them, except that the order of passing via the Israeli and 
Palestinian counters will be reversed. 
  For passengers going through the second and third lanes, 
the Israeli officer will provide the passengers with a blue 
card, after checking their documents and identity, and verifying 
their entry permits. An Israeli and a Palestinian official 
posted at the exit of the Palestinian wing will verify and 
collect the cards. White and blue cards collected will be 
checked by Israeli and Palestinian officials. 
  In cases where either side denies the entry of a 
non-resident 
passenger, that passenger will be escorted out of the terminal 
and sent back to Jordan or Egypt, as appropriate, after 
notifying the other side. 
  5. Liaison Bureau 
  a. There will be a liaison bureau at each crossing point in 
order to deal with matters arising regarding passengers passing 
through the Palestinian Wing, issues requiring coordination, and 
differences regarding the implementation of these arrangements. 
Without derogating from Israel's responsibility for security, 
the bureau will also deal with incidents. 
  b. This bureau will be comprised of an equal number of 
representatives from each side and will be located at a 
specified location inside each terminal. 
  c. This bureau will be subordinate to the CAC [Civil Affairs 
Committee] and to the relevant RCCO [Regional Coordination and 
Cooperation Office]. 
  6. Miscellaneous 
  a. Special arrangements will be agreed upon by the two sides 
regarding the passage of goods, buses, trucks and privately 
owned vehicles. Pending this agreement, the current 
arrangements will continue to apply. 
  b. Israel will attempt to complete the structural 
alterations on the Rafah and Allenby Bridge terminals not later 
than the date of the completion of the withdrawal of Israeli 
forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. 
  If these structural alterations are not completed by that 
time, the arrangements described in this Article shall apply, 
except for those arrangements that cannot be implemented without 
the structural alterations. 
  c. In order to cross through the crossing points in and out 
of the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, residents of these areas 
will use documents as detailed in (the Annex developed by the 
Civilian Committee). Pending the entry into force of the 
interim agreement, other West Bank residents will continue to 
use the existing documents issued by the military government and 
its Civil Administration. 
  d. Visitors to the Gaza Strip and Jericho area will be 
permitted to remain in these areas for a period of up to three 
months granted by the Palestinian authority and approved by 
Israel. The Palestinian authority may extend this three-month 
period for an additional period of up to three months and will 
inform Israel about the extension. Any further extensions 
require the approval of Israel. The Palestinian request for a 
four-month period and an additional four months will be 
negotiated in Taba in the immediate future. 
  e. The Palestinian authority will ensure that visitors 
referred to in paragraph d. above will not overstay the 
duration of their entry permit and authorize extensions.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat last night signed an agreement in Cairo concluding 
the arrangements at the border crossings and the security 
arrangements in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The size of the 
Jericho area will be decided upon in a meeting between Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. Israel 
and the Palestinians also agreed on several security issues, on 
the powers of the Palestinian authority under autonomy, and on a 
number of other disputed issues. The agreement and the 
accompanying maps were signed by Foreign Ministry Director 
General Uri Savir and PLO representative Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad 
Quray']. The foreign minister and the PLO chairman added their 
signatures. 
  Our correspondent in Cairo Moti Amir reports that the signed 
agreement will be valid for one year after which a committee 
established by both parties will be able to reexamine it. As 
for the Gaza Strip, the parties last night agreed that it would 
have three settlement areas which would also contain the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] bases responsible for the Jewish 
settlers' security. Major General 'Uzi Dayan clarified that 
Israel would retain exclusive responsibility for the east-west 
roads which the settlers would use to drive from the Gaza Strip 
into Israel. The areas on the side of the road would be under 
Israeli responsibility in coordination with the Palestinians. 
Israeli security forces would have the right to act against any 
elements who either seek to harm or actually attack Israelis 
moving on the agreed upon roads. At a certain stage, the 
Palestinians will assume responsibility for the pursuit of the 
perpetrators. 
  Israel will retain full control of the border area in the 
Gaza Strip, as well as full responsibility for the security 
arrangements at the Rafah border crossing. On the Allenby 
Bridge, Israel will have the inviolable right to check any 
person crossing the bridge from Jordan and will be authorized to 
prevent the entry of any undesirable individual. Those barred 
entry will not be permitted to appeal the decision. An Israeli 
security guard will be stationed on the bridge. There will be 
two inspection rooms at the border terminal, one room for Israel 
and the other for the Palestinians. The agreement also 
stipulates arrangements for the Jericho area but the size of 
this area will be decided upon during the meeting between 
Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak welcomed the agreement. He 
telephoned Prime Minister Rabin and invited him to visit Egypt. 
Mr. Rabin thanked the Egyptians for their contribution to the 
peace process and said he would gladly visit Egypt after the 
implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians had begun. 
Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reported that the prime 
minister approved all the details of the agreement. The chief 
of staff, the deputy chief of staff, the head of the 
Intelligence Branch, and the director of the Shin Bet arrived at 
the prime minister's bureau, examined every detail of the 
agreement, and conveyed their approval to Cairo. Our political 
correspondent reports that the military, civilian, and economic 
talks will resume next week in Taba and Paris. The two parties 
will also discuss the issue of the Gaza Strip roads in detail at 
the Taba talks. 
  Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that 
the IDF will be capable of withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and 
the Jericho area within one month if it is required to do so. 
Army sources nevertheless asserted that an additional 300 
million shekels, on top of the already authorized sum of 250 
million shekels, would be required to finance the redeployment.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 Feb (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has affirmed 
that Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has delivered an 
official message to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat 
notifying him that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will 
discuss the final size of the Jericho area with him personally 
when they meet in the near future. Sha'th pointed out that the 
final size of the Jericho area will remain frozen until 'Arafat 
and Rabin meet. He noted that the Palestinian side signed the 
map relating to the Jericho area but expressed reservations 
about it. 
  It is worth noting that Palestinian President 'Arafat balked 
for a few moments when he was asked to sign one of the maps 
pertinent to Jericho. He did not want to sign it but then 
signed it with reservation. 
  Official Palestinian sources in the negotiating delegation 
said that the Palestinian party's basic objection to the 
crossings document, which delayed the official signing for more 
than three hours, focused on the paragraph relating to the 
administration of the crossing points. These sources said that 
they tried to get the best conditions under the general 
Declaration of Principles agreement, which gives Israel the 
right to be in charge of external security but emphasizes 
national Palestinian sovereignty. 
  Palestinian sources pointed out that the administration of 
the crossing points gives Israel the right to have a general 
director with a Palestinian and an Israeli deputy director. 
They stressed that the Palestinian party managed to obtain a 
confirmation of total Palestinian authority over the crossing 
points, side roads [turuq 'aradiyah], and the settlements [wa 
akkadat anna al-janib al-filastini istata'a al-husul 'ala ta'kid 
bi al-sultah al-filastiniyah bil kamil sawa' bi al-nisbah lil 
ma'abir aw al-turuq al-'aradiyah aw al-mustawtanat]. Noting that 
the emphasis on Palestinian authority was important, they said 
that the Palestinian side gave Israel the right to be in charge 
of external security, including recognition of what the 
Declaration of Principles agreement outlined on external 
security. These sources said that according to the agreement, 
the Palestinian party has the right to coordinate security on 
the crossing points, side roads, and the settlements. They said 
that the Palestinian party also obtained the zones outlined in 
the document under the title "yellow areas," which are the 
Palestinian areas excluded from the Israeli settlements. Israel 
has a certain authority over these areas but the Palestinian 
party has full authority over them.

  [Excerpt] The negotiations to finalize the security and 
civilian issues of the Gaza-Jericho agreement will resume on 
Monday, 14 February. At the same time, the talks between Israel 
and the PLO on economic issues will resume in Paris. This was 
decided today in a phone conversation between PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. The two men also 
decided to meet again in Cairo if the need arises to break 
through a stalemate in the talks. 
  Mr. Peres conferred today tete-a-tete with the prime 
minister. They were later joined by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
commanders and senior Foreign Ministry officials. 
  Speaking to our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik, Mr. 
Peres said: We overcame mountains of tension and suspicion, and 
the negotiations with the Palestinians may now be held at a 
faster pace. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Taba, 13 Feb (MENA)--Sources in the Palestinian 
delegation to the Taba negotiations have stated that, at its 
meeting tomorrow, the Security Affairs Committee will discuss 
the details of the formation of the Palestinian police force in 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  The sources noted that the Palestinian side demands that 
this 
force be made up of 9,000 troops, while the Israeli side demands 
that it consist of 6,000 troops, including the civil defense 
force as well as the intelligence and public security services. 
  The sources added that the Civilian Affairs Committee, which 
is led by Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi on the Palestinian side, and 
by Gadi Zohar, head of the West Bank's Civil Administration, on 
the Israeli side, will resume its discussions concerning the 
transfer of powers to the Palestinians in the fields of water, 
civil planning, antiquities, electricity, communications, and 
land registration. 
  The Palestinian sources said that the Confidence-Building 
Committee, which stemmed from the Taba negotiations, will 
discuss the amnesty plan, which will include the release of all 
the Palestinian detainees in Israel at a date not later than 
July. The sources said that the number of Palestinian detainees 
is 9,000, following the Israeli authorities' recent freeing of 
some 2,000 Palestinian detainees. 
  The current round of the Taba negotiations is expected to 
last until Thursday [17 February] night.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chief Palestinian </F>
negotiator in the peace talks with Israel, by Me'ir Kohen in 
Cairo "this evening" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sha'th] In fact, this agreement is not an 
agreement in the true sense of the word, but a declaration 
resolving three major problems that obstructed these talks aimed 
at implementing the Declaration of Principles and the beginning 
of Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Those three 
problems relating to the crossings, the size of the Jericho 
area, and the security measures in the areas of the settlements 
and in the roads leading from the settlements to Israel 
constitute an obstacle. We announced yesterday that we had 
solved this problem and overcame this obstacle. Consequently, 
the road will be open to reaching an agreement. This is not a 
separate agreement from the Gaza-Jericho accord, nor is it a 
partial agreement, rather it is a declaration overcoming the 
major obstacles. 
  [Kohen] Will this declaration provide answers to Israeli 
security concerns and at the same time achieve Palestinian 
wishes and aspirations? 
  [Sha'th] I believe that it responds to a great many of these 
aspirations, but it does not necessarily give each party what it 
wants. This is the nature of such talks, especially as far as 
these kinds of phased talks are concerned, which seek to reach 
partial agreement on a transitional government, not on full 
sovereignty and an independent state. There is no model that 
one can follow. Therefore, we have to work out some kind of 
arrangement that realizes the Palestinian people's aspirations 
for dignity, independence, and freedom and upholds the Israelis' 
demand for security, which has always constituted an Israeli 
concern. 
  [Kohen] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, at the end of every set of 
negotiations each side calculates the losses and gains of an 
agreement. What is the Palestinian gain from the agreement 
signed in Cairo last night? 
  [Sha'th] That we implement the accord that we signed in 
Washington relatively quickly because we have lagged behind. 
Now we should end this delay so as to implement this accord. 
The beginning of an implementation of the accord will open new 
vistas to our people in the occupied Palestinian territories 
that will gradually remove from them the burden of Israeli 
occupation and achieve for them part -- part -- of their 
aspirations in governing themselves and repatriating part of the 
Palestinian people to Palestine, especially those displaced in 
1967. Consequently, the gain here is to start moving matters 
toward the realization of the Palestinian people's goals.

  [Text] President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali today received the 
Palestinian president, Yasir 'Arafat at the Palace of Carthage. 
Yasir 'Arafat made the following statement after the audience: 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording] I held a good, positive and warm 
meeting with the president. I acquainted him with all that has 
recently been agreed upon in Cairo between us and the Israelis, 
and the agreement which we signed. On my arrival in Tunis I 
sent the president a copy of this agreement so that he would be 
totally informed of its details. I also pointed out to the 
president the significance of our continuing consultations and 
contacts so that we could reach a final agreement, which we 
expect at the end of this month, God willing. This would enable 
us to precisely and faithfully implement what we signed in 
Washington last year -- last September. 
  I listened to the advice and directives of the president, 
which I value highly. I thanked him, in my own name and in that 
of the Palestinian people, for all that Tunisia -- president, 
government and people -- gives to the Palestinian issue and to 
the Palestinian people. [end recording]

  [Text] In Tunisia, opposition leader Moncef Marzouki was 
not permitted to hold a news conference yesterday afternoon. 
Marzouki, who is an independent candidate in the presidential 
elections and former chairman of the Tunisian League for the 
Defense of Human Rights, was held for two hours at a police 
station. Marzouki wanted to explain to reporters the reasons 
for his presidential candidacy. 
  His candidacy needs sponsorship by 30 mayors or deputies. 
With one single exception, all Tunisian mayors and deputies 
belong to the Democratic Constitutional Assembly, the party in 
power. This is why Marzouki wrote to President Ben Ali, who is 
an official presidential candidate himself, to ask him to 
intervene to help him overcome the legal obstacle that is 
hindering his candidacy.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 10, IRNA -- Foreign ministers of 
the contact group of the Organization of Islamic Conference 
(OIC) [Islamic Conference Organization, ICO] in Jakarta, 
Indonesia Thursday [10 February] appealed to the U.N. Security 
Council to forge effective measures to lift the siege of 
Sarajevo. Issuing a statement, foreign ministers of the OIC 
contact group including those of Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, 
Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Egypt are currently in 
Jakarta to hold their annual meeting. The foreign ministers 
branded as "insufficient" the recent decision by the North

for a special session of the U.N. Security Council to find a 
just solution to the Bosnian problem. 
  The OIC also declared its support for holding of an 
international conference to find a just solution to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. 
  Some 16 NATO member states in Brussels Wednesday threatened 
Bosnian Serbs with air strikes unless the Serbs withdrew 
artillery and heavy weapons beyond 20-kilometer range of the 
Sarajevo within ten days. The Serbian forces have agreed to 
withdraw their artilleries beyond the range of Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Report by Ilyas Nasrallah: "'Arafat Faces Problem of </F>
Ratifying Agreement Inside Executive Committee"] 
  [Excerpts] Jerusalem -- Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat 
is facing a major problem vis-a-vis the ratification of the 
agreement he signed on 9 February with Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres on security arrangements for the Palestinian 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Apart from the popular opposition to the agreement inside 
the 
occupied territories, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that there 
is opposition within the Palestinian leadership in Tunis, as 
'Arafat's attempt to convene a meeting of the PLO Executive 
Committee to brief it and seek its approval of the agreement has 
failed. [passage omitted] 
  Palestinian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that three 
Executive Committee members -- namely, Sulayman al-Najjab 
(representative of the Palestinian People's Party), Yasir 'Amr 
(independent), and Samir Ghawshah (representative of the 
Palestinian Popular Struggle Front) -- refused to accept the 
invitation sent to them by 'Arafat to attend the committee's 
meeting to ratify the agreement -- which means there is no 
longer a sufficient quorum to endorse any decision in the 
highest executive authority inside the PLO. [passage omitted] 
  The refusal of al-Najjab, 'Amr, and Ghawshah to agree on the 
security arrangements means that 'Arafat will not be able to 
pass the agreement constitutionally at the Palestinian level, as 
the number of those who approve of it will not reach 12, the 
number required to complete the quorum. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tunis, Feb 12 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat said 
Saturday [12 February] he expects to sign a final deal with 
Israel by the end of the month to launch Palestinian self-rule 
in Gaza and Jericho, the Palestinian agency WAFA reported. 
  The PLO would continue its efforts to achieve a "precise and 
faithful implementation" of the September 13 autonomy deal, he 
said. 
  'Arafat spoke after briefing Tunisian President Zine El 
Abidine Ben Ali on the PLO-Israel security pact signed in Cairo 
on Wednesday, which overcame some of the obstacles to launching 
self rule. 
  Israel's withdrawal is due to be completed by April 13. 
  The two sides will resume talks in Egypt on Monday to 
finalize agreement on autonomy.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, Feb 10 (AFP) -- PLO 
officials will start arriving in the occupied Gaza Strip from 
February 22 to implement the Palestinian autonomy agreement on 
the ground, a leading Palestinian figure said Thursday [10 
February]. 
  "On February 22 or 23, PLO officials will come to the Gaza 
Strip to begin to apply the Cairo agreement," Furayh 
Abu-Middayn, a member of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Middle East peace talks, told AFP. 
  "They will perhaps be accompanied by units of the Palestine 
Liberation Army," added lawyer Abu-Middayn, chairman of the Gaza 
Bar Association and a close associate of PLO chairman Yasir 
'Arafat. 
  The soldiers are to join the Palestinian police force which 
is to ensure order during autonomy. 
  The statement came after Israel and the PLO settled their 
differences on security aspects of the September 13 Declaration 
of Principles for Palestinian autonomy. 
  The security deal opens the way for autonomy to be 
implemented, but Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has warned 
it will take at least another month to sort out other issues, 
such as the economic side of self-rule.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mahmud 'Abbas, member of the PLO </F>
Executive Committee and of Fatah's Central Committee, by 
Khayrallah Khayrallah; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Khayrallah] What is the significance of the 
agreement reached in Cairo? 
  ['Abbas] What took place in Cairo was an important initial 
step toward the implementation of the Declaration of Principles 
signed in Washington on 13 September. It also solved the most 
important problems which had been left to the negotiators to 
find solutions for. I believe that the Cairo agreement has 
opened and paved the way for the practical implementation (of 
the Declaration of Principles agreement), for [Palestinian] 
entry into Gaza and Jericho, and for the immediate and direct 
assumption of authority in these two regions, plus the immediate 
and direct assumption of responsibility for five authorities in 
the rest of the West Bank cities. (The five authorities are: 
education and culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation, 
and tourism.) 
  [Khayrallah] How do you interpret the text of the new 
agreement? 
  ['Abbas] Everyone knows the issues negotiated. They are: 
The security issues, the area of the settlements in Gaza, the 
crossings, and the size of the Jericho area. The agreement 
covered most of these points although some minor points were 
left to be resolved later. There are very many details we need 
to immediately begin to confirm on paper but they are not 
crucial or serious issues requiring the kind of negotiations 
held in Cairo or before. We can say that the Cairo agreement 
covered 80 percent of the fundamental issues and only 10 percent 
of the paper issues which will be discussed by the Taba and 
Paris committees. 
  [Khayrallah] Could the new agreement be regarded as a 
completion of what took place in Cairo, Granada, and Davos 
earlier? 
  ['Abbas] What has now taken place in Cairo is a continuation 
of what we started in the second Oslo meeting, Davos, Cairo, and 
Granada. The same issues were discussed within the same 
framework and in the same spirit. 
  The reason we achieved what we did in Cairo was that there 
was closer common understanding of the agreement. That 
facilitated the result achieved. 
  [Khayrallah] What will be the formal position at the 
crossings? 
  ['Abbas] There will be a special situation at the crossings 
for the people of the Gaza and Jericho areas in that the Israeli 
control will be invisible. What the agreement tries to 
guarantee is preservation of Palestinian dignity at entry and 
exit points, speedy procedures, and elimination of many 
formalities and obstacles people used to face at the crossing 
points where they had to wait hours or even days sometimes. 
  [Khayrallah] Why was Shim'on Peres reluctant to answer a 
question about the area of Jericho? 
  ['Abbas] A confirmed area of Jericho has not yet been 
finally agreed upon. Efforts are being made to increase that 
area and fulfill the Palestinian and Israeli concepts of that 
area in a way that would ensure distancing it from the 
settlements. I believe that the issue of the area of Jericho 
will not be a problem in the future. 
  [Khayrallah] Are you optimistic about this being a step 
toward the implementation of the Declaration of Principles? 
  ['Abbas] I believe that what took place in Cairo was an 
important step toward the implementation of the agreement. I am 
very hopeful that the implementation will begin and end before 
13 April so that we would be able to fulfill the sequence of the 
other dates which were stipulated in the agreement and which 
should be honored.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member of the PLO </F>
Executive Committee, by Kassab Samawi in the studio; date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Samawi] Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. For 
about five months, the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have 
been attracting regional and world attention. After the famous 
Oslo agreement, which many described as a surprise, and after 
the historic signing ceremony in Washington, difficult 
negotiations were held in regional and world capitals, then in 
Davos and back to Cairo, where three-day around-the-clock 
negotiations were held, ending with the signing of the Cairo 
agreement on 9 February. These events were accompanied by many 
developments and questions, which need some clarification. Our 
guest on this show is Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, PLO Executive Committee 
member. Welcome Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank you. 
  [Samawi] Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh, what is the Cairo agreement? How 
important is it toward the implementation of the self-rule 
agreement and the establishment of the national Palestinian 
authority in the autonomy regions? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] In fact, the Cairo agreement has been an 
extremely important step. This is because it is the key to the 
implementation of the interim agreement on the establishment of 
the national Palestinian authority. In this agreement, we 
addressed and resolved a number of major issues, without which 
we cannot proceed to resolve other issues and, consequently, 
begin implementation of the interim agreement. Of course, at 
the forefront of these issues is the question of withdrawal 
arrangements from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region. 
Evidently, agreement has been reached on all withdrawal 
arrangements from these two areas. What remains to be done is 
to define the final size of the Jericho area. This issue will 
be addressed during the meeting between President 'Arafat and 
Yitzhaq Rabin. The second point is the question of crossings 
and entry. On this point, many criticisms and various 
observations can be made. In fact, there is no perfect 
solution. No solution can be termed an ideal solution. 
Certainly, there has been a settlement and halfway solutions to 
a number of issues pertaining to the crossings and some 
withdrawal arrangements. For our part, we want to indicate that 
through any possible steps or arrangements, the objective of the 
Palestinian negotiator is to address two basic points. First, 
to start the removal of the occupation from parts of the 
Palestinian territory and to ensure the continuation of these 
steps toward the achievement of the final objective, which is 
the removal of the occupation from the entire Palestinian 
territory. The second objective is to put an end to all forms of 
coercion and suffering that our people have been enduring 
throughout the years of the occupation. With respect to the 
crossings, I believe what has been reached concerning this issue 
has been made public, but I want emphasize some important 
points. First, there is a Palestinian participation in the 
administration and security of the crossings. This is something 
that did not exist in the past. There is also a special 
Palestinian wing for the citizens of Gaza and Jericho as a first 
phase and as a first step, given that Gaza and Jericho will 
witness an end to the occupation. There are also some detailed 
arrangements concerning the verification of identification cards 
and interrogation, which will involve Palestinian participation. 
This is because the unilateral occupation control in the past 
has caused a great deal of pain and suffering for our people 
throughout the years of the occupation. 
  Additionally, there are arrangements concerning, for 
example, the arrival of Palestinian and other visitors from 
abroad. The duration of the visit may be for three months, for 
example, and then extended for a minimum of three extra months. 
This is still an unresolved issue. We demand a minimum of 
eight months, after which it can be extended with the approval 
of the two parties. 
  There are Israeli security demands that were raised. We 
dealt with these demands in a balanced way without allowing any 
exaggeration of Israeli security demands to encroach on the 
substance of the Oslo agreement, that is ending occupation. We 
linked the ending of occupation with the steps that will lead to 
alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people, as I have 
said. 
  [Samawi] Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh, when the famous Oslo agreement was 
announced, it was first received with surprise, the surprise 
then turned into acceptance and then wonderful manifestations. 
People in the occupied territories prepared to receive 
President 'Arafat. After that, you entered into very difficult 
negotiations with the Israelis. This state of imbalance has in 
fact created confusion and despair among the Palestinian people. 
You then reached the Cairo Agreement two days ago. What can 
one tell the kinsfolk in the occupied territories? Are the 
difficulties and problems now over? Can they expect to see soon 
the national Palestinian authority on the Palestinian soil, or 
see an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, from 
Gaza and Jericho? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] I wish to say one important thing here. 
Withdrawal will take place and the dawn of the Palestinian 
independence will soon arrive. This process has started and 
will not end without completing all of its chapters; that is, 
the arrival of the dawn of freedom and the Palestinian people's 
wresting of their sacred national rights over their territory. 
But the start of this process is extremely difficult and 
complicated. There are so many years of occupation and there is 
an interconnection in relations -- economic, administrative, and 
other relations between us and the occupation apparatus and 
occupation as a whole. Therefore, severing these links requires 
first very difficult and tiring negotiations, and, second, a 
detailed, specific treatment of each issue. The most dangerous 
thing in this process is to lose patience. Losing patience will 
lead to solutions which we, the Palestinian people, will have to 
suffer for many years to come. What is important is to continue, 
persistently. 
  There are some issues which some people think are marginal 
issues. What happened in Cairo, negotiations over details and 
secondary issues, such as entry and exit gates? Yes, they may 
seem secondary, but when you take into account the suffering of 
the Palestinian citizen throughout the years of occupation, 
these are principal issues. And, as far as the Palestinian 
future is concerned, they are also principal issues. 
  The Israeli side says that dates are not sacred. In fact, 
this is not true. The dates are part of an integrated 
mechanism. The proof that dates must be respected, must be 
sacred, is that in the Cairo agreement, we considered that these 
arrangements realized were for one year and are liable to 
amendment and change in the future. 
  Therefore, we are aware that there is a feeling of 
frustration, a feeling that since the date fixed for December 
was not respected, then perhaps the entire agreement is 
unimplementable. We say that this question is not linked only 
with the Palestinian negotiator. This is the responsibility of 
the entire Palestinian people, their forces, groups, figures, 
and establishments. The battle of the Palestinian negotiator is 
the battle of the entire Palestinian people, the battle of all 
the Palestinian people's brothers and allies. There are many 
complicated problems between us and the occupation. 
  For instance, in Cairo we solved a number of difficult 
problems but certain issues have remained which will need a 
solution and treatment during the next two or three weeks. For 
instance, the issue of the economic relations. We certainly aim 
not to make the Palestinian entity economically subservient to 
occupation. We do not want to have an economic occupation that 
is camouflaged in one form of another. We want the Palestinian 
entity's relations open and closely connected with its Arab 
surroundings, especially with the Jordanian and Egyptian 
brothers for well-known pan-Arab and geographic reasons. 
  There is going to be a sharp struggle over the issue of 
economic relations. Negotiations will also be held on a number 
of administrative issues. For instance the identity cards to be 
issued by the Palestinian authority, how they will be approved 
and how they will be treated. We wish to have something similar 
to a Palestinian passport so that the Palestinian citizen will 
be able to get rid of many years of suffering. For instance, in 
the Gaza Strip, there is no Palestinian passport or identity 
card recognizable in the world. There are restrictions. 
  All these issues will be subject to negotiations. We believe 
that it is possible to reach agreement on these issues within a 
short time now that the more difficult questions have been dealt 
with in Cairo. Other problems remain such as defining the size 
of withdrawal from the Jericho area. Of course, we consider 
this issue to be very important because the entire process we 
are undertaking aims to ensure taking at least first steps 
during the first stage of the interim solution to end the 
occupation. 
  I'd like to make the point here that there is no such thing 
as a prefect solution. We would gladly help the opposers of the 
recent Cairo agreement determine its negative points. We will 
tell them how much bargaining it took to get that agreement. 
  [Samawi] Some observers contend that the Palestinian 
negotiators talking to the Israelis were facing tough choices, 
and therefore had to accept certain Israeli conditions with 
respect to the crossings, withdrawal, security for the Jewish 
settlements, and other important themes. Is that a fair 
assessment? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] I'd like to point something out here. Let's 
draw a comparison between the Cairo agreement and the parent 
Oslo accord. There were certain constraints in the Oslo accord, 
and these may have been relaxed rather than toughened by the 
recent Cairo agreement. I do not want to talk about details 
that will serve no useful purpose for us the Palestinian 
negotiators. However, the themes on which agreement was reached 
in Cairo -- like the question of an Israeli pullout from the 
Gaza Strip, the area of the settlements and their locality -- 
had been the subject of haggling for two months. These were the 
sticking points that held up the signing on 13 December. 
Regarding the settlements in Gaza, the Israelis insisted on a 
security presence for themselves in the adjoining territories. 
But we insisted that, in other respects, these territories be 
under Palestinian control and readily accessible to 
Palestinians. We also insisted that there be joint, rather than 
exclusively Israeli, patrols on the roads leading to the 
settlements -- short as they are, and, in our opinion, 
artificial, and, therefore, disposable, as they are. It takes 
patience and stamina to address such issues. We also insisted 
that the main road that passes through the Gaza Strip from end 
to end be under Palestinian control. The Israelis can build 
bridges to span that road but not roads. As I have said every 
single detail of these issues took tough bargaining to sort out. 
This is because we had set out to achieve the twin objective of 
ending occupation and easing our people's suffering. Neither 
the Palestinian negotiator nor the process in general stand to 
gain anything from frustrations. What we really need is patience 
and resolve, even if the negotiating process has to drag on for 
longer. 
  Quick solutions will not be sufficient and will be 
dangerous to our future. Solutions achieved through 
determination, patience, and perseverance provide us with better 
guarantees even if they take longer, better guarantees for our 
future, and for the future of this entire political process. 
  [Samawi] Watching the signing ceremony in Cairo, we noticed 
that President 'Arafat was less cheerful than he had been during 
the Washington ceremony to sign the Oslo agreement. You were 
close to 'Arafat for three days and during the signing ceremony. 
Was he satisfied with the agreement? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] I believe that brother Yasir 'Arafat gave his 
views frankly during the news conference because he believes 
that this agreement is an important, big step toward finalizing 
the interim period agreement. We are happy whenever we proceed 
toward a solution. However, the suffering to reach this 
solution had been great. At the same time, we feel the immense 
responsibility of the Palestinian negotiator when he decides and 
agrees on any point. Perhaps it was the sense of this 
responsibility that appeared [on 'Arafat] and not that he did 
not want to sign as the news agency dispatches alleged. I do 
not believe these reports are worth responding to. 
  [Samawi] Last question, what is the next step after the 
Cairo 
agreement? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] This is the important thing, I imagine. As I 
said, the Cairo agreement allowed us to move one step forward to 
finalizing the interim phase agreement. There are so many 
issues that require extensive negotiations. The primary issue 
is the national authority and its role during the interim phase. 
I believe that in general, this issue is already solved as 
enunciated in the Oslo agreement. There are certain details 
related to it. 
  There is also the problem of the Palestinian police force 
entry, with its numbers and weapons, etc. There are a number of 
administrative problems such as documents, ID's and passports 
and how they will be dealt with. There is the issue of economic 
relations. All these issues require treatment and solutions 
over the next two weeks in order to complete the agreement. 
With this agreement, there is a primary issue for us; namely, 
releasing all the Palestinian detainees. There will be no 
agreement without releasing all the detainees and the detained 
Palestinian freedom fighters. If we want to turn a new leaf, 
none of these strugglers, who are the elite of our people, 
should be in jail. 
  We began negotiating on this subject in Taba. Of course, we 
negotiated on details and not on the principle itself because 
the issue of releasing the detainees is not negotiable. There 
was a fixed timetable extending to 13 April. If the agreement 
is completed on various issues and is applied before 13 
April--and I believe this is possible because withdrawing from 
Gaza and Jericho and certain issues related to the transfer of 
authorities require only one month, between 13 March and 13 
April--then the timetable on releasing all detainees will be 
implemented along with completing the withdrawal. 
  I repeat that this is an essential issue for us and we 
emphasized it in the Cairo meeting. We are aware that the 
Palestinian people, their brothers, allies, and friends, and all 
those who want the peace process to succeed will be happy to see 
tangible, real implementation of all these papers, agreements, 
and signatures. Failure to begin implementation will cause a 
loss of trust in the entire process. 
  That is we have the link between the steps of withdrawal 
and the measures concerning reducing and ending the suffering on 
the crossing points, and so forth, and the release of 
Palestinian detainees. All these issues are linked so that we 
can arrive at the starting point in the implementation of the 
transitional phase. Here, I wish to say that this is only a 
starting point in the transitional phase. It will be followed 
by negotiations covering issues such as ending the military 
occupation, ending the Israeli civilian administration, and the 
Palestinian authority's assumption of control over all 
Palestinian territory in the West bank and Gaza Strip. These 
issues are expected to be completed after several months, three 
or four months after completing the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  Even as regards the Cairo agreement, it is clear that on the 
Gaza and Jericho wings there will be a principal Palestinian 
presence and an invisible Israeli presence. On the other wing, 
that of other Palestinians in the West Bank, there will be a 
joint presence. These are all transitional arrangements because 
when the full role of the Palestinian authority over all 
Palestinian territory is complete, and when withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho takes place, when the remainder of Israeli troops 
are deployed in certain areas in the other parts of the West 
Bank, and when the military occupation ends, the role of the 
Palestinian authority will in this case be comprehensive. 
  Here I wish to say, once again, that the main thing is to 
view this issue as a very serious one that needs patience and 
perseverance. We have no ready-made solutions. We are dealing 
with a unique, extraordinary, and unprecedented situation. 
Therefore, it is natural to see incomplete solutions because 
these are transitional, and not final solutions. 
  [Samawi] But we hope to arrive at permanent and complete 
solutions that will return the territory and establish the 
comprehensive peace. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Exactly. Here I wish to point out that within 
the framework of this process, Palestinian-Jordanian 
coordination is a basic and central element. I am not saying 
this as a slogan, often repeated when talking about this 
subject. For example, in our economic talks with the Israelis, 
which may start in a week and last for several weeks, we cannot 
reach agreements before having a joint Jordanian-Palestinian 
agreement over so many issues, such as customs, taxes, the entry 
and exit of commodities, transportation, and other issues. The 
two parties must be speaking from the same grounds in order to 
be able to guarantee the Jordanian and Palestinian common 
interests. Palestinian interests cannot be separated from 
Jordanian interests, or vice versa. Therefore, I believe 
cooperation between the two parties must be strengthened over 
the economic and administrative issues -- and there are many 
details that have to be worked out by the Palestinians and 
Jordanians, there are issues concerning water and others issues. 
The cohesion should not remain limited to slogans only. We have 
to detail it and find practical solutions and move within the 
context of this practical solution to deal with it in the 
negotiations with the other party. 
  [Samawi] Thank you for this interview, Mr. Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh. Ladies and gentlemen: On your behalf, we thank PLO 
Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Text] PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab 
refused to participate in the Executive Committee meeting which 
began in the Tunisian capital last evening. The meeting was 
called for by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, al-Najjab said he did 
not attend the meeting to protest the manner in which the 
Executive Committee was treated. He said the decisions of the 
committee and the instructions it gave to the Palestinian 
negotiating delegation were not respected. The Cairo agreement 
between 'Arafat and Peres was a deviation from all these 
decisions and instructions. Al- Najjab urged the Executive 
Committee members to reject the Cairo agreement because it 
entrenches the Israeli understanding of the Declaration of 
Principles. 
  Al-Najjab, who is the representative of the Palestinian 
People's Party [PPP] in the Executive Committee, warned against 
continuing the current policy of dealing with the negotiating 
process, which is proceeding without any terms of reference and 
any clear negotiating plan that is committed to the Palestinian 
understanding of the Oslo agreement, whose objective is to 
secure Israel's withdrawal from all Palestinian territories 
occupied in 1967 and to guarantee the Palestinian people's right 
to self-determination. 
  Al-Najjab warned against the danger of unilateral and 
unstudied decisions, and against responding to pressures 
employed by foreign parties that do not take into account the 
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. 
  Al-Najjab called anew for respecting the Executive 
Committee's decisions and for organizing its action as the 
higher Palestinian authority, including its decision to form a 
body responsible for negotiations that no party can overstep. 
He also called for adopting a Palestinian negotiating plan that 
reflects the Palestinian militant concept of the Oslo agreement, 
and for assigning qualified Palestinian politicians the task of 
implementing this plan. 
  Following the signing of the Cairo agreement, the PPP's 
Political Bureau issued a statement, a copy of which was 
received by AL-RA'Y. The statement urged the Executive Committee 
to reject this agreement and to lay down new bases for the 
negotiations aimed to realize the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinian people. 
  The statement described the agreement as disappointing to 
the 
popular aspirations, and said the warnings expressed by the PPP 
when it conditionally accepted the Oslo agreement were 
legitimate. Since the beginning, the PPP has called for giving 
the Oslo agreement a militant concept and not to view it as a 
petition presented to the Israeli authorities. The PPP also 
called for working out a clear negotiating plan, for high 
Palestinian performance, and for a fixed political authority. 
These demands ensure that the Oslo agreement will be the 
beginning of the march toward independence, and prevent the 
Israeli concept of implementation of the agreement, which would 
entrench the occupation. 
  The Cairo agreement is closer to the Israeli understanding 
of 
the Oslo agreement. It adopted the Israeli concept of security, 
which is an expansionist one that seeks to entrench settlements. 
This concept conflicts with the natural concept of security as 
stipulated in Resolution 242, which is based on the 1967 borders.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, Feb 11 (AFP) -- 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, a former chief Palestinian negotiator, 
said Friday [11 February] the Israeli-PLO security accord signed 
in Cairo did not cover issues essential to achieving a just 
peace in the Middle East. 
  "This is an accord on issues which are unimportant in 
relation to the ultimate goal of achieving a just peace," the 
former chief Palestinian negotiator at the Washington peace 
talks told AFP. 
  "The key issue to be resolved, which may lead to a just 
peace, is that of ending the (Israeli) settlements in Jerusalem 
and the rest of the occupied territories," he said. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi earlier told the Arabic daily Al-Quds: 
"Palestine existed before this agreement, and will exist after 
it, but the accord will not allow Palestine ever to appear on 
the map of the Middle East." 
  He was commenting on PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat's statement 
after signing the accord that the name of Palestine had returned 
to the map of the Middle East. 
  Meanwhile Sufyan Abu-Zayda, a representative of 'Arafat's 
Fatah movement in the occupied Gaza Strip, told AFP the accord 
"only deals with a tiny part of our demands, and will not last 
long if the occupation and settlements remain." 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS, which is opposed to 
the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal signed in Washington on September 
13, said the Cairo security agreement was "worthless," and 
"fulfils Israeli conditions." 
  "The settlements will remain a breeding ground for 
provocation and tension, and will allow Israel to justify its 
persecution of the Palestinians," said HAMAS official Khalid 
al-Hindi.

<F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES," by Wafa' 'Amr] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- The agreement initialed in Cairo on 
Wednesday [9 February] between the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) and Israel reflected the great Israeli 
security concerns which delayed implementation of the Sept. 13 
self-rule accord, political observers said Friday. 
  For Palestinians, the agreement on Israeli withdrawal from 
Gaza Strip and Jericho and self-rule was far less than their 
minimum aspirations, and it drew mixed reaction from PLO 
officials. 
  Although people's reaction in general has been cautious, the 
overall response of many Palestinians was negative. 
  Supporters of the agreement said that when implemented, the 
initial impact of the harshness of the text would be softened. 
This was contested by other PLO officials who said that the 
negative elements of the Cairo agreement would be revealed upon 
implementation. They said since many issues have been left for 
further negotiation, as was the case of the Oslo agreement, it 
meant the door may be left open for Israel to renege on 
implementation as it sees. 
  Both supporters and opponents of the Cairo deal agreed that 
like the Oslo agreement, many pitfalls and ambiguities shrouded 
many of the articles, particularly security issues, despite the 
immensely detailed security procedures at border crossings. 
However, supporters said Palestinians had improved many of the 
Oslo accord's conditions, and Israel has conceded on security 
issues and on Palestinians' role on border crossings despite the 
Israeli army's opposition. "We have made many concessions in 
the Oslo agreement, but since everything is relevant, we believe 
we have improved many of the conditions stated in the 
Declaration of Principles," said a PLO negotiator. 
  A Tunis-based PLO official, who negotiated the 
implementation 
agreement in Davos, Switzerland, and Cairo said the accord was 
supposed to have been signed in Davos, but the Israeli army's 
opposition had dissuaded Israeli Prime Minister Yithzaq Rabin. 
  "The army felt that this agreement penetrated the strong 
Israeli security wall by giving Palestinians some control on 
border crossings. Strategically, it means a great deal for the 
army when they recognise the fact that they have to share 
security control with the Palestinian authority," he said. 
  He added that the initial Israeli position was to post a 
Palestinian flag on crossings, but it was changed into accepting 
the raising the flag on the building itself. "This means 
recognising Palestinians' authority on the entrances to 
Palestine." 
  PLO negotiators felt satisfied with most of the agreement 
despite the fact that many issues remained to be negotiated. 
They said negotiations with the Israeli delegation were a very 
difficult battle. 
  "In practice, we were negotiating with three Israeli 
delegations -- the army who were the hardliners, (Foreign 
Minister Shimon) Peres the moderate, and (Prime Minister 
Yithzaq) Rabin, who was less hardline than his army generals," a 
PLO negotiator said. The PLO leadership was concerned that the 
delay in the implementation of the Sept. 13 accord was eroding 
support for it among Palestinians and it would only have drawn 
more divisions and bloodshed in the occupied territories. 
Initialing the agreement, they argued, would give internal 
momentum for the negotiations on implementation of the Oslo 
accord. 
  Some Palestinians argued that the PLO leadership had 
conceded 
a lot to Israel in order to sign the agreement. 
  Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab, however, 
considered the Cairo agreement "dangerous" saying it included 
many loopholes and PLO concessions. 
  What has been accepted in Cairo was redeployment of Israeli 
troops rather than withdrawal since Israel has been given 
control over areas surrounding Jewish settlements much bigger 
than the size of settlements, he said. 
  "The agreement has given Israel all its wants regarding 
security issues, and nothing for Palestinians. Israel has also 
been given control of a number of roads connecting Jewish 
settlements which divide the Gaza Strip," Mr. al-Najjab said. 
  "We are very worried about the possibility that Israel might 
choose to accept only its own reading of the Cairo 
agreement...we are concerned, over some articles which indicate 
the continuation of occupation instead of its gradual removal as 
stated in U.N. Security Council Resolution 242," Mr. al-Najjab 
said. 
  But chief Palestinian negotiator Faysal al-Husayni, who took 
part in the negotiations, defended the agreement saying that 
both the Oslo and Cairo agreements were only a step that would 
ultimately lead to independence and a Palestinian state. 
  "Unfortunately, people cannot still distinguish between an 
interim period, which we are negotiating, and the final status," 
Mr. al-Husayni said. 
  "We are talking about an interim period, during which final 
status negotiations will start, which means we will be moving 
from one stage to another, and it also means we will not be able 
to end occupation completely and at once during the interim 
stage," he argued. "However, when we reach final status, it 
will be the period of independence and statehood." 
  "I think this agreement includes elements that would enable 
us gradually to achieve independence because it paves the way 
for Israeli withdrawal and redeployment from densely Palestinian 
populated areas," he said. 
  Other PLO officials called for guarantees that ensure the 
implementation of the agreement. 
  PLO official Nabil 'Amr, a supporter of the Sept. 13 accord 
but who calls for democratisation and political reforms in the 
PLO, said the Cairo agreement offers Israel the upper hand and 
right to be the effective reference point for all decisions. He 
said the need to break the deadlock reached in negotiations 
should not mean ignoring the pitfalls which would challenge the 
PLO's ability to implement what it signed. 
  "It seems that the need to sign the agreement after the 
series of unsuccessful attempts since September evidently led to 
a failure to include the necessary guarantees for a scheduled 
implementation," Mr. 'Amr said. 
  He said the PLO leadership should start working on securing 
such guarantees in order to ensure better conditions during the 
interim and final periods. 
  Some senior members of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), 
who, for months, have been preparing to enter Gaza and Jericho 
and to control security there, disapproved the Cairo agreement 
and felt great disappointment. 
  "We have no real role in security affairs or management of 
Jericho and Gaza Strip," said a senior PLA officer. "We were 
told we would enter the self-rule areas and be in full control, 
or at least have a big say in our own security affairs, but it 
seems Israel will not only maintain overall security but also 
manage all the details." 
  They were referring to such issues as stated in the text of 
the accord as having a policeman armed with a handgun at the 
border crossings and total subordination to Israeli security 
concerns as mentioned in many of the articles concerning border 
crossings. 
  Some residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip visiting 
Jordan said they were gravely concerned over the possibility 
that they would be more humiliated and harassed by having to go 
through three checking areas while crossing rather than just two. 
  "Now we go through the Israeli and Jordanian checking 
points. 
According to the new agreement, we will be passing through an 
additional Palestinian checking point," one West Bank resident 
said. 
  He said Palestinians feel terrified and humiliated by 
Israeli 
measures while crossing the bridge. "Under the excuse of 
security, Israel will refrain from improving these measures." 
  Palestinians crossing into Jordan have complained of 
harassment by Israeli security officers at the crossings, and 
humiliating body searches. The details of crossing procedures 
in the Cairo agreement have frightened them more. They feel 
there will be added security measures which will exhaust them 
instead of preserving their dignity. 
  Both Mr. al-Najjab and Mr. 'Amr criticised the PLO's 
negotiating strategy which led to the loopholes in the Oslo and 
Cairo agreements. They called on the PLO leadership to clearly 
define and reconsider its negotiating strategy in order to 
improve the Palestinian position in peace talks and to avoid 
surprises. 
  Mr. al-Najjab, upset that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat signed 
the Cairo agreement before presenting it to the Executive 
Committee for approval, also criticised the PLO leader for 
downgrading his position and accepting to negotiate with Mr. 
Peres, the foreign minister, as his equal. 
  'Arafat has accepted the role of the head of Palestinian 
delegation in the PLO-Israeli liaison committee instead of 
Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin). This gives Israel the right to 
demand that Palestinians return to a higher reference than 
'Arafat for final decision...this weakens the Palestinians' 
negotiating position," Mr. al-Najjab said. 
  He said Palestinians were worried that if such concessions 
were repeated, the PLO leadership would lead the people to 
further "dangerous pitfalls" because the leadership has been 
acting without being accountable to any side.

  [Excerpts] Palestinians in the territories greeted the 
signing of the agreement in Cairo with mixed feelings. There 
were no expressions of joy over the additional step on the way 
to the implementation of the agreement on self-government, but 
people intensely followed media reports about the talks. 
  "Until people see changes happening before their very eyes 
they will not believe that a new era is indeed on their 
doorstep," Ghassan al-Khatib, a leading member of the team 
conducting the peace talks, said shortly before the agreement 
was signed. 
  Al-Khatib is one of a group of public figures who have been 
strongly criticizing the PLO leadership's decisionmaking 
process. Palestinians involved in the peace process have been 
resentful over the fact that they have not been included in the 
talks ever since the Declaration of Principles was signed. In 
view of this criticism, Faysal al-Husayni was summoned to Cairo 
at the last minute. 
  Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi is not sure that the Cairo 
agreement 
constitutes a step forward. He heads the critics of the PLO 
leadership, and has not budged from his position that the 
settlements are the obstacle precluding the attainment of the 
main goal. "As long as the settlements remain untouched and as 
long as land, particularly in Jerusalem, is being confiscated to 
build houses I do not think we are advancing toward the goal we 
are seeking to reach." 
  The aspiration for a just peace that meets the expectations 
of both peoples is not being realized, 'Abd-al-Shafi believes. 
Israel is forcing on the Palestinians all sorts of clauses and 
things that they should not accept. 
  Moreover, he believes that the insistence on controlling the 
border crossings was unnecessary. "Let Israel go on controlling 
the borders. It does not matter, as long as there is a change 
on our side," said 'Abd-al-Shafi, alluding mainly to the 
settlements and what ensues from their continued existence. 
[passage omitted] 
  Furayh Abu-Middayn is pleased that some progress has been 
made in the talks, but like many others in the Gaza Strip, is 
sorry that Yasir 'Arafat was forced to accept conditions and 
arrangements he does not like and which might cause problems in 
the future. 
  "Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is not pleased either, but he 
realizes that the Palestinians are the weak side because Rabin 
is unwilling to give in. 'Arafat hopes that a new mechanism of 
relations will nevertheless evolve that will enable a 
substantial change in the future." 
  What worries Abu-Middayn most is the arrangement concerning 
the roads leading to the settlements. "The continued presence 
of Israeli soldiers in the area constitutes a powder keg. This 
friction will cause problems. We will not be able to control 
the extremists, and extreme soldiers may also act irresponsibly." 
  In his opinion, an arrangement could be worked out similar 
to 
the convoys driving to Mount Scopus before 1967. "The roads 
could be opened to the passage of settlers two or three times a 
day. You need not assemble a gigantic military convoy each time 
they want to drive to Tel Aviv to buy a carton of milk. People 
in Israel apparently do not understand what this means to the 
Palestinians who have to be in contact with the soldiers day in 
and day out." 
  The arrangement concerning Netzarim and Kfar Darom is 
absolutely illogical, says Abu-Middayn. "Because of 40 people, 
hundreds of thousands will suffer," he says. If the inhabitants 
of Netzarim and Kfar Darom were relocated, even to settlements 
in the Qatif Bloc, the Palestinians would retain territorial 
continuity and there would be fewer points of friction. He 
claims he has heard Netzarim settlers say they are willing to 
leave. "They will quit the moment they get compensation and, if 
not, they will slowly leave of their own volition," he asserted.

<F P=106> [By Sakher Abu El Oun] </F>
  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, Feb 10 (AFP) -- 
Palestinians in the occupied territories shrugged off the 
Israel-PLO security accord on Thursday [10 February], doubting 
that much would change for them in the near future. 
  'Arafat tried to tell his people that Palestine was back. 
  "Palestine and the name of Palestine have returned to the 
map 
of the Middle East," he said after signing the deal in Cairo on 
Wednesday night. 
  But few seemed to be listening on the Gaza Strip and West 
Bank, where reaction was at best prudent. 
  "I'm bitterly and cautiously optimistic," said 32-year-old 
sweetshop owner Taysir Al-Khudari. 
  "The Oslo agreement did not fulfil our hopes and this Cairo 
agreement is no better. But what can we do? We have to accept 
it because the international situation is not good for us. 
  Gazans were more occupied with stocking up with delicacies 
for Ramadan, the Moslem fasting month which starts this weekend. 
The market was packed with people queueing for the oriental 
sweetmeats "halawa" and "amardine." 
  The eruption of joy which marked the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles for autonomy in Washington on 
September 13 seemed part of a distant past. 
  "I danced for eight hours because I thought the Israeli 
soldiers were going to leave straight away or at least by 
December 13 at the latest," Taysir said. 
  "But the deadline passed and nothing happened. There is no 
hope left here," he said, to nods of agreement among his 
customers. 
  Army jeeps still patrol the mean streets of the Gaza Strip, 
watched by a resentful population of 780,000. 
  "The occupation continues and the oppression will stay the 
same up to the last minute," said artificial limb manufacturer 
Hisham Saqallah. "I will start being optimistic when I see the 
last Israeli convoy leave." 
  The reaction of the Islamic fundamentalist movement HAMAS, 
which opposes the Middle East peace process, was predictable but 
nonetheless severe. 
  "Israel has imposed its conditions on the Palestinians, who 
could not make their voice heard," said Khalid al-Hindi, a HAMAS 
official. 
  "This agreement gives Israel the right to continue to hunt 
down Palestinians. This agreement is good for Israel because it 
opens the door wide to the Arab world." 
  Even 'Arafat's men were downbeat. 
  At the PLO offices in Gaza City, official Safran Abu-Zayda 
said: "The agreement does not satisfy our demands. But if the 
occupation and (Jewish) settlement continue the accord will not 
hold," he warned. 
  "Nothing has changed until now," said Fatah official Ahmad 
Hillis. 
  "Today is the same as yesterday. We have learnt to be 
cautious because every time the Israelis block implementation of 
the agreement."

<F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan al-Zaydan, member of the Fatah </F>
Supreme Committee in the Gaza Strip, by Me'ir Einstein; place 
not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Einstein] What is your reaction to the 
agreement reached in Cairo? Are you pleased? 
  [Al-Zaydan] We are not pleased. It is not an agreement we 
are proud of; you should be proud of it. It is better for you 
than for us, that is clear to everyone. 
  [Einstein] Why? 
  [Al-Zaydan] Because you got everything you want, and we the 
Palestinians, received everything you offered us. I regret to 
say that due to the situation we were forced to accept it since 
we could not get anything better. If the Israelis had taken a 
bold decision to evacuate the settlements in the Gaza Strip, the 
whole predicament the police minister has referred to about the 
need for coordination between the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
and the Palestinian police force would not have been necessary. 
You would have simply put up a fence near the Gaza Strip. 
There would not have been differences of opinion about the 
crossings and the police. 
  [Einstein] Does that mean that what is upsetting you is that 
the settlements are staying in the Gaza Strip? 
  [Al-Zaydan] Believe me, that not only disturbs us, but also 
you, and deep down you know that it will complicate matters. We 
Palestinians view this agreement as a start, a new opening, a 
step forward, in the direction of a comprehensive, just peace. 
But this agreement on its own is not comprehensive peace and it 
cannot be relied upon to bring full peace. That is not possible. 
  [Einstein] You know, as I do, that it is an interim 
arrangement based on Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in many 
fields, and in fact its success will be tested through that 
cooperation. Do you believe cooperation will be fully achieved? 
  [Al-Zaydan] I see it as a test for the Palestinians and 
Israel. Can we make progress, take several more steps, or 
remain deadlocked, that is the test. I hope that both of us 
will succeed and we will go forward. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Taysir Khalid, member of the Political Bureau of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], has 
emphasized that the front will continue to struggle alongside 
all Palestinian nationalist forces, organizations, and 
personalities against the Gaza-Jericho agreement and all forms 
of its implementation, including the Cairo agreement, signed by 
PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. 
  Khalid added that the signing of the Cairo agreement by 
Yasir 
'Arafat is illegitimate and is not binding on the PLO or the 
Palestinian people because 'Arafat did not refer to any of the 
PLO institutions that have a say on the present and future of 
the Palestinian people. 
  Khalid urged the PLO Executive Committee chairman to respect 
the Palestinian people's will, and to subject the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement to a referendum among the Palestinians inside and 
outside the occupied territories. He said this referendum would 
let the Palestinians express their opinion on this agreement and 
this destructive policy that furthers division within the PLO 
and the Palestinian people, sacrifices the Palestinian people's 
higher national interests, and changes the territories into 
protectorates under Israeli sovereignty.

<F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>
  [Excerpts] Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman 
for the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has stated that the 
Cairo agreement reflects Zionist control of all matters and 
clearly shows what happens when agreements are signed in the 
absence of a balance of power. That's why we were not surprised 
at the Zionist military quarters' support and the preliminary 
Palestinian reaction of frustration and denuncation. 
  In an interview with AL-DUSTUR Ghawshah said: Anyone who 
reads the Cairo agreement will be angry and furious and will 
wonder how any Palestinian side could sign such an agreement? 
[passage omitted] 
  Ghawshah said: This agreement, which was overshadowed by the 
negative reactions of even 'Arafat and his entourage, will make 
the Palestinian people, after recovering from their shock and 
bitterness, forcefully support their basic constants of holding 
onto the Palestinian land and liberation, no matter the cost or 
the arduous road. 
  He added: It has become evident that the Zionist octopus, 
which clings to every inch of the occupied Palestinian soil, 
will give up this land only if a lethal blow is dealt to its 
head. [passage omitted] 
  On the new mediations between Hamas and Israel, Engineer 
Ghawshah said: Rabin has failed to solve or emerge from the 
security dilemma because five months after the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, and 'Arafat's instructions to halt the intifadah and 
his promise to punish those who do not respond to these 
instructions, intifadah and jihad operations continue to take 
place and to daily constitute a slap on the face of Rabin's 
government . 
  Ghawshah said: The Rabin government sent many ranking 
military and influential people to hold a dialogue with some of 
the Hamas leaders who are in the Zionist jails. The reply of 
the imprisoned brothers was clear and categorical; the refusal 
to stop the intifadah and jihad operations. This is the stand 
by which Hamas abides, a stand rejecting any dialogue with the 
usurper Zionist enemy. All national and popular liberation 
movements abide by such a stand in their confrontation of 
occupation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Tunis, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front 
[PPSF], a PLO-affiliated group led by Samir Ghawshah, has 
criticized the agreement signed in Cairo by PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. The PPSF 
said that it considers the agreement incomplete, stressing that 
it cannot help complete talks on the other issues to reach a 
comprehensive agreement.

  [Text] The Palestinian People's Party [PPP], formerly the 
Communist Party in the territories, announced tonight that it is 
rejecting the Cairo agreement and is demanding that the PLO 
Executive Committee be convened to reject the agreements reached 
by Peres and 'Arafat. Ghassan al-Khatib, one of the party 
leaders, told our correspondent Linda Sherzer that he did not 
believe 'Arafat would be able to muster a majority for the 
agreement in the Executive Committee. 
  The PPP contends that the Cairo agreement is based on the 
Israeli demands, and the arrangements stipulated in it are 
liable to last long after the interim period. The party, which 
supported the Oslo agreement, is particularly opposed to the 
arrangements at the border terminals and the security roads 
leading to the Gaza Strip settlements.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Comes After the Cairo Agreement?"] </F>
  [Text] Now that the Israeli and Palestinians sides have 
signed the Cairo agreement, which was drafted with considerable 
help from our Egyptian brothers and whose implementation will 
require tireless and continuous efforts, the question in the 
occupied territories, the Arab world, and everywhere is: What 
comes after the Cairo agreement? 
  Attempting to answer this question, the Palestinian side 
sees 
the agreement as a direct conduit for turning the Declaration of 
Principles [DOP] from written words on paper into facts on the 
ground -- facts that will gradually evolve into the realization 
of long-term Palestinian aspirations, namely, the establishment 
of an independent state and the restoration of the name of 
Palestine to the map of the Middle East. 
  Israeli sources, however, are not so optimistic. They regard 
the Cairo agreement as the first in a series of agreements and 
understandings that must be reached before actual implementation 
of the DOP. These sources do not expect those agreements to be 
signed within a month. 
  In the aftermath of the signing of the DOP and the interim 
agreement, events in the occupied territories have been 
characterized by an escalation of Israeli practices, a 
considerable increase in the suffering of Palestinians, the 
perpetuation of the closure on Jerusalem, and the continued 
detention of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. All these and 
other developments have cast a dark shadow over any positive 
expectations during the past weeks. Nonetheless, the signing of 
the Cairo agreement has somewhat restored momentum to the 
negotiating process, even though this momentum has not yet been 
translated into reality. 
  Perhaps the most visible proof of the theoretical nature of 
the Cairo agreement is the statement by high-ranking Israeli 
sources that the situation in the occupied territories will 
remain as it is until a detailed agreement in various spheres is 
reached. Therefore, according to these sources, no withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho will be carried out nor will any 
Palestinian prisoners be released before those agreements are 
signed. 
  Again, any optimism regarding the future would be premature. 
Their long experience -- whose most recent lesson was the 
disappointment and frustration of those who had pinned their 
hopes on the interim agreement -- has taught the Palestinian 
people realism. Therefore, after the Cairo agreement, it is 
better for one to wait, be patient, and expect surprises of a 
different nature.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 11 (AFP)--Egyptian security forces 
recently foiled a bid by Islamic militants to assassinate 
President Husni Mubarak, a pro-fundamentalist newspaper reported 
here Friday. 
  AL-SHA'B said nine militants of the outlawed al-Jama'ah al- 
Islamiyah group, currently on trial in a military court, planted 
explosives at Sidi Barrani airport near the Libyan border and at 
Mubarak's residence at the town's military base. 
  They planned to detonate them during a visit by Mubarak, who 
holds regular meetings with Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi 
at the base. 
  AL-SHA'B said the trial of the nine accused began in secret 
at the Sidi Barrani military court on January 30. 
  The plot was uncovered when a al-Jama'ah militant was 
arrested in a raid in the southern suburbs of Cairo on January 
19. The militant, who was wounded in the raid, made a full 
confession in hospital under the influence of drugs, the paper 
said. 
  It is the second assassination plot against Mubarak to be 
revealed by the opposition press in Egypt. In October two 
militants among a group of 19 who planned to kill the Egyptian 
leader were sentenced to death by the Alexandria high military 
court. 
  Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah has urged tourists and foreign 
investors to quit the country, saying it is stepping up its 
violent campaign against the authorities. 
  Almost 300 people have died since the fundamentalists began 
a 
campaign two years ago, aimed at toppling the government and 
installing an Iranian-style Islamic republic.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Feb (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
said Egypt believes the use of force against the Serbs in Bosnia 
is stipulated in a Security Council resolution and requires no 
further discussion. 
  Commenting today on NATO's decision to give the Serbs 10 
days 
to withdraw or face an air strike and on Russia's request for an 
urgent Security Council meeting to discuss the demilitarization 
of Sarajevo, Musa said Egypt and the Islamic countries will 
oppose any attempt to hinder the end of the Serbian aggression. 
He explained that if the attempts to delay things continue, 
then the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims must be lifted. 
  He stressed that UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali 
has a Security Council mandate to use force to protect UN forces 
and populated areas and that this mandate is sufficient, 
especially so in light of NATO's offer to use its resources in 
this regard. 
  Foreign Ministry sources said 'Amr Musa has asked Dr. Nabil 
al- 'Arabi, Egypt's permanent delegate at the United Nations, to 
convey to the UN secretary general and Security Council 
president Egypt's viewpoint on attempts to delay the NATO 
decision. 
  The sources added that Musa asked Egypt's permanent delegate 
at the United Nations to hold consultations with the Islamic 
countries' Liaison Group to adopt a clear stance on the issue.

  [Excerpt] The mysterious "Islamic Group" statement warning 
and threatening foreigners in Egypt has drawn many reactions. 
In an exclusive statement to AL-'ARABI, Muslim Brotherhood 
spokesman counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi dismissed the statement of 
the so-called Islamic Group as "a stupid statement issued by an 
unenlightened quarter." The statement is unacceptable from all 
religious and human aspects because it harms the interests of 
the country, he said. 
  A person describing himself as a leader of the so-called 
Islamic Jihad Organization telephoned AL-'ARABI and strongly 
denounced Tal'at Qasim's statement, saying it provides an excuse 
for attacking Islamic groups. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Deputy General Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood </F>
Mustafa Mashhur: "Yes to the Boycott... No to Normalization."] 
  [Excerpts] Talk has recently intensified about normalizing 
ties with the Zionist enemy and ending the Arab boycott. This 
has happened since the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as if this 
agreement has abolished all barriers and the Zionist enemy has 
become an Arab country with which one can deal without 
restrictions or inhibitions. Some Arab countries might even be 
eager to deal with the Zionist enemy even though their relations 
with other Arab countries are not quite all right or are even 
hostile. 
  We all remember that when President al-Sadat concluded the 
Camp David Accord with the enemy, this aroused the anger of the 
other Arab countries and prompted them boycott Egypt, declaring 
that Camp David was a catastrophe in the full sense of the word 
because it prevented Egypt from confronting and fighting the 
enemy and at the same time rendered the remaining Arab countries 
unable, even combined, to fight the enemy without Egypt. 
[passage omitted] 
  What has befallen some Arab countries to make them now alter 
their attitude? We now see some of them preparing to abolish the 
boycott and normalize ties with the Zionist enemy, although the 
latter has not changed its hostile designs, particularly its 
goal of establishing an Israel extending from the Nile to the 
Euphrates. Neither has the enemy stopped oppressing the 
Palestinians -- killing them, driving them from their country, 
demolishing their homes, and usurping their land. 
  We also see the U.S. commerce secretary visiting several 
Arab 
countries, hinting that the boycott has begun to unravel, and 
calling for its abolition while claiming untruthfully that this 
will serve the interests of the Arabs. We know that there are 
three levels of boycott: boycotting the enemy's companies and 
its products, boycotting foreign companies that have 
partnerships with the enemy, and finally boycotting foreign 
companies that deal with the enemy. The current talk is about 
abolishing the third kind, followed by the second, and finally 
the first. 
  I hereby declare: We have prior experience of dealing with 
the Jews. We saw how they were planning to control our trade 
and economy, how they had a monopoly over several basic 
commodities, and how they manipulated prices to serve their 
interests at the public's expense. The Jews have not changed. 
Shall we now give them another opportunity to control the Arab 
economies as a prelude to their political and, eventually, 
military hegemony over us? [passage omitted] 
  The United States is calling for an end to the boycott 
against its companies that deal with the Zionist enemy because 
it wants to turn the Arab world into a big market for its 
products while at the same time ensuring the Zionist enemy 
remains an industrial base equipped with technological know-how 
and a sophisticated infrastructure. We see the United States, 
and the Zionist enemy behind it, claiming that the boycott 
threatens the prospects of peace. They pretend to forget that 
the boycott decision was unanimously adopted by the Arab 
countries in 1950 as an expression of the rightful Arab claim to 
Palestine and to protect the Arab economy from being infiltrated 
by the enemy, who opposes Arab economic and industrial progress. 
  The United States pursues its own financial gain, even at 
the 
expense of other nations. By assisting the Zionist enemy, it is 
ignoring the Palestinians' rights, including their right to 
their land. This causes it to be the target of the hate and 
hostility of the Islamic nations, because the Palestinian cause 
is the cause of all Muslims which they will never abandon no 
matter how long the issue lasts or how many sacrifices are 
needed. Despite the current cruel pressures and the tyranny of 
the greedy, U.S. and Zionist hegemony will not last. 
  We tell the Arab countries: Do not abandon the boycott. 
Do not respond to the pressures. The boycott is a political 
and economic tool to boost the Arab world's economic growth and 
protect Arab investment and workers. This boycott has its roots 
in the depths of Arab patriotic and religious sentiments. It 
must remain rigidly airtight, impervious to any attempts to 
smuggle Zionist goods to Arab markets via third countries after 
changing the labels that attribute them to the Zionist enemy. 
  O Arabs, do not bear the onus of terminating the boycott and 
the disastrous consequences it will bring to future generations, 
who will undoubtedly curse you for it. [passage omitted] 
  When he concluded the Camp David Accord, al-Sadat said he 
wanted to eliminate the hostility and thaw the icy barriers 
between Egyptians and Jews. However, the Muslim Egyptian people 
who were angered by the usurpation of Palestine's blessed land 
rejected this normalization despite the government's attempt to 
impose it on them in various spheres of activity. Only a few 
biased opportunists, disloyal to their nation and religion, went 
along with it. Furthermore the attempted normalization has had 
several adverse effects: Some Jews have been involved in 
narcotics and counterfeit currency cases and have attempted to 
spread AIDS or sow sedition between Muslims and Christians. We 
ask those who advocate normalization: What will its benefits 
be? It will bring no benefits; it is entirely bad. 
  Our Arab countries must protect themselves from this evil, 
which will corrupt our young people, ruin our economy, and spoil 
all spheres of life. The creed followed by our Muslim people 
imposes a duty on us: to evict these gangs from Palestine. We 
must learn that appeasement will enable them to occupy our 
countries and pursue their quest for a greater Israel extending 
from the Nile to the Euphrates, and indeed as far as the city of 
the Prophet [Medina], may God's peace and prayer be with him. 
  Current events increase our pain. The United States, Rabin, 
and others are putting pressure on Yasir 'Arafat to accept the 
enemy's conditions to complete this humiliating agreement. 
'Arafat believes it will lead to the establishment of an 
independent Palestinian state. Rabin, on the other hand, wants 
it to be a Jewish colony where Palestinians run the service 
sector. We recently even heard Yasir 'Arafat saying that he 
does not want a Palestinian state-- thereby arousing the anger 
of many around him--but a confederation with Jordan. 
Additionally, it is not in the Jews' nature to keep promises or 
covenants. They break them if that is to their benefit. 
  Arabs and Muslims, you must abide by this principle: "Yes to 
the boycott, no to normalization." You must then work and carry 
on a jihad to liberate all Palestine from the river to the sea. 
God will give succor and victory comes only from him. 
  "No" to those who say that the boycott can be ended after 
peace is attained, for there will be no peace, but surrender and 
subservience. The Muslims will not submit to the enemies of God 
and humanity.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Feb MENA)--The Cairo newspapers today 
stated that the will of peace has imposed itself on the Middle 
East and that intentions of armed conflict have receded after 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres signed the Cairo Agreement to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho Accord. 
  AL-AKHBAR said the agreement will help toward signing a 
final 
accord between 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
to implement the Declaration of Principles, which everyone hopes 
will end the tension and bloody conflict prevailing in the 
region for approximately 50 years. 
  The paper called on Israel to eliminate any potential 
obstacles that might mar the tranquility of the negotiations' 
final phase or that might impede the required measures to 
implement the accord. 
  The paper warned against building new settlements that will 
create disputes and a conflict of authority in these territories 
at a time when understanding and cooperation are needed to 
streamline the transfer of power in an atmosphere of tranquility 
and coexistence. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH praised President Husni Mubarak's efforts to 
bring the Palestinian and Israeli views closer until the Cairo 
Declaration was signed. 
  It said: Egypt hosted Palestinian and Israeli negotiating 
delegations and was open to a difficult dialogue between the two 
sides at a crucial moment and while the Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators faced a difficult situation. The Palestinian 
negotiator relied on vast Egyptian experience of dialogue and 
formulating negotiating positions. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH expressed the hope that the peace process will 
extend east to include Jordan and Israel and north to include 
Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. 
  AL-AHRAM emphasized that Egyptian diplomacy did all it could 
to push negotiations between the two sides to the shore of 
safety in line with its historical and cultural role in the 
region as the largest Arab country.

  [Text] Tripoli, 12 Feb, JANA -- The brother leader of the 
revolution has made the following statement to JANA: The world 
laughs from ear to ear when it hears the American President's 
report to Congress to the effect that Libya represents an 
extraordinary threat to the United States. The American 
President himself does not believe in what he presented to the 
Congress, because if Libya was like a threat, then America would 
not have been able to treat it in this inhuman way, but it seems 
that the American President is obliged to say this to Congress 
for several reasons: First: He himself is a victim of 
aggressive imperialist circles and because he is part of the 
their game and is under their pressure. 
  Second: He thinks of America's regime as being dictatorial 
in 
accordance with the emergency law that allows the American 
President to rule in a completely dictatorial manner if 
America's interests abroad are threatened. This was the very 
pretext of Reagan when he wanted to shed the blood of Libyan 
children and when he wanted to rule America with absolute and 
autocratic rule for eight years -- this was in fact what he 
achieved. 
  Third: Orders may have been issued from Tel Aviv to the 
White House to make the above statement, and this is the most 
probable. In all cases, the American President must prove this 
to the United Nations to whom Libya will necessarily have 
recourse for investigations into this serious accusation. Or is 
it congratulations from the American President to the Libyan 
people on the occasion of Ramadan? On a personal level, it 
might be a reply to the condolences that al-Qadhdhafi sent to 
him following the death of his mother, although most analysts 
believed that there was a typing mistake and the one intended 
was Japan and not Libya.

  [Text] Tripoli, 14 Feb (JANA) -- An official source here 
today denied the French news agency's report that quoted a 
Jordanian official source as having said that Libya is the 
unspecified state which King Husayn referred to in connection 
with the Jordanian diplomat's assassination. 
  The source said: Such allegations which some Western 
information media have been circulating are totally untrue. He 
said: We are convinced that involving Libya's name in this seeks 
to harm Libya and, by the same token, to undermine the fraternal 
good relations that link it with fraternal Jordan. The source 
stressed that Libya has no connection with such actions which it 
condemns and rejects.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif, secretary general </F>
of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, by 'Ali 
al-Ruzz in London; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Ruzz] There is much talk about the possibility 
of a split within the National Front for the Salvation of Libya 
[NFSL]. Is that true? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] All organizations and parties, especially the 
big ones, sometimes have differences of opinion and even 
differences of positions. This is one of the facts which apply 
to any political action. No organization has been able to avoid 
it or brag about it. An organization such as the NFSL, entering 
its 13th year in the face of a regime which has many resources 
and capabilities at its disposal, and carrying out its task 
against a background of serious and continuously changing 
regional and international circumstances, cannot be expected not 
to encounter situations and changes over which there would be 
some differences of opinion ... That is what has occurred 
within the NFLS over the past months. 
  I would like to draw the attention of those interested in 
Libyan affairs and Libyan opposition affairs to the fact that 
what is important is not the occurrence of differences but the 
extent of the organization's ability to face and discuss them in 
a democratic and civilized way. The developments you have 
mentioned proved that the NFSL is capable of finding appropriate 
solutions through its democratic institutions represented by the 
field offices, the leadership body, the Permanent Bureau, and 
the National Council, which will be meeting soon to complete its 
resolution of pending issues. 
  [Al-Ruzz] Is there a split? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] There is no split. There are differences, 
sometimes sharp differences, over organizational and struggle 
issues. Some of them were discussed during the meeting of the 
Permanent Bureau, and discussion of the remaining issues will be 
completed at the meeting of the National Council. 
  [Al-Ruzz] Could the differences lead to a split? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] We believe that is unlikely and we hope it 
would not happen. Even if it did happen, it would be a familiar 
phenomenon in the world of the organizations with circumstances 
similar to our own. 
  [Al-Ruzz] In the event of a split, how -- candidly speaking 
-- would that reflect on the NFSL's performance? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] I will not make the mistake of saying that it 
would not affect the NFSL. It would be painful and regrettable 
for any front or organization to lose any of its sons, but what 
I do know and am certain of is that the NFSL has enough manpower 
and struggle mettle to healthily overcome any negative 
phenomenon, God forbid. Do not forget that the NFSL has, 
throughout its march, undergone some fierce crises which could 
have blown away its entire existence, such as the times of its 
exit from Morocco in 1983, from Sudan in 1985, and from Chad in 
1990. 
  [Al-Ruzz] Have the attempts to mend the rift been fully 
exhausted? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] I have already said that the Permanent Bureau 
tackled many issues during its meeting of last December and left 
it to the National Council, which is the highest authority, to 
deal with the other issues. The council members have been 
summoned to an extraordinary meeting to complete that task. 
  [Al-Ruzz] There are those who criticize you for having 
hastily announced that the NFSL claimed responsibility for the 
Bani-Walid military incidents last October, as a result of which 
dozens of the NFSL's supporters inside Libya were arrested. 
  [Al-Muqaryif] What I would like to emphasize -- and hope 
would put an end to the controversy over that matter -- is that 
the October events were in fact a real and strong uprising in 
which a large number of men from the Libyan Armed Forces in 
Bani-Walid, Misratah, and Tarhunah participated. The regime was 
violently shaken by these events and it faced them with violence. 
  This fact cannot be changed by the regime's attempts to 
trick 
some sectors of the media, which have put forward certain claims 
of the regime's own making, nor can it be changed by the 
differences of opinion that have emerged regarding the NFSL's 
responsibility. 
  The other point I want to stress here is that a number of 
officers who participated in the operation or were linked to it 
have managed to leave Libya and will shortly meet with the media 
and present all the facts they know about what happened, and 
will reveal the extent of the NFSL's connection with that 
serious operation. 
  [Al-Ruzz] May we know the names of these officers? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] Of course not, for the time being. 
  [Al-Ruzz] When will they meet with the media? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] In the near future. We are sure that official 
circles in a number of states are aware of and know what really 
happened, its magnitude, and the degree of the NFSL's 
responsibility for that. 
  [Al-Ruzz] What about those who were detained as a result of 
the NFSL claiming responsibility? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] Do you think that the regime waits for the 
NFSL's announcement before taking savage and severe action 
against the members of the military and the civilians it 
suspects of having moved against it? The regime does not need 
any announcement from anyone. Its record over the past years 
confirms that fact. Actually, the NFSL acted out of a sense of 
responsibility about that internal act of heroism which the 
regime tried to play down and demean, and for which it tried to 
give other reasons -- such as claiming that a number of officers 
rebelled because of a delay in the payment of their salaries, or 
that they moved militarily for tribal reasons. Our knowledge of 
the truth of that action and the men who were behind it made us 
move to tell the world that it was part of the Libyan people's 
opposition movement seeking to overthrow the regime in favor of 
a democratic alternative. 
  [Al-Ruzz] Why do you give so much importance to the October 
military movement, which was over in two days? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] I believe that the October movement was one of 
the largest and most serious movements against the regime, be it 
in reference to the nature of the movement, preparation for and 
participation in it, or its timing. Prior to that movement the 
regime had believed that the tribes were loyal to it, and it 
relied considerably on their men. But the occurrence of that 
movement and the participation of tribal people in it faced the 
regime with a new situation. For one thing, it could no 
longer depend on the loyalty of these tribes and, second, it 
could not fill the great vacuum created after the expulsion and 
arrest of members of these tribes in the various army units, 
security organs, and other civilian sectors. 
  [Al-Ruzz] Those opposed to the NFSL criticize its close 
links with the United States and maintain that these links 
confuse matters and rob it of its independence? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] The NFSL has, since its foundation, been 
anxious to understand the regional and international realities 
related to the Libyan issue, and it has addressed these 
realities most evenly, wisely, and responsibly. That in no way 
means that the NFSL has at any time forfeited its independence, 
will, or national aspirations. The Bab-al-'Aziziyah operation 
was the best evidence of that. Furthermore, the fact that the 
NFSL had initiated and maintained its military program in Chad 
as represented by the Libyan National Army and its struggle in 
the most difficult circumstances was another example of that 
fact. There can be no doubt that the October events were another 
manifestation of that at a time when many thought that the NFSL 
had forfeited its will to struggle against the regime in the 
face of international developments and changes. 
  [Al-Ruzz] It has been claimed that Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif 
is the obstacle standing in the way of unification of the 
opposition factions, and that his way of addressing that issue 
has frequently impeded the unification process.... 
  [Al-Muqaryif] It would be better not to address this 
question to me. I wish you had addressed it to the NFSL's 
institutions. I wish you had asked them: Did Muhammad 
al-Muqaryif really try to impose his views on this matter? I 
believe that accepting such a claim would mean that all the 
NFSL's institutions, including men and fighters, are just a 
front manipulated by the secretary general. Nobody would 
believe or accept such a claim. 
  I am proud to belong to a democratic organization based on 
men who have chosen its objectives, methods, and policies. All 
I and my brothers in the leadership do is implement and carry 
out the resolutions passed by the National Council in its past 
sessions. Furthermore, I have no personal opinion on that issue 
that is any different from the views of my brothers; and even if 
I did, I believe that the brothers would have prevented me from 
imposing that opinion on them. 
  [Al-Ruzz] As we are talking about unity of the opposition, 
what did happen at the Algeria meeting? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] First of all, I am not saying that the meeting 
of the opposition took place in Algeria. I will not say where 
it was held. A meeting did take place between the NFSL, the 
National Alliance, and the Coordination Committee. It did in 
fact crown the efforts of many elements of the Libyan 
opposition, not necessarily from the highest ranks of the 
leadership. The meeting took place in the middle of last 
October and it was attended by 
  We agreed that, after the signing of the statement, a 
committee would be formed to prepare for a general conference of 
the Libyan opposition, and we had hoped that the conference, 
which was supposed to take place 21 November, would lead to the 
signing of a dcoument stating the constant principles of the 
struggle. We in the NFSL were prepared to go all the way in the 
field of coordination among the factions even if that meant the 
formation of a unified command and joint bodies, and so on. 
But, regrettably, the circumstances of one of the organizations 
prevented the signing of the draft statement. Its leadership 
asked for more time to think about the matter. There can be no 
doubt that the sudden disappearance of Mansur al-Kikhya was a 
great loss for these efforts, as well as for the national 
struggle in general, because of his tolerant nature and 
willingess for dialogue and the bridging of views. He played a 
major part in promoting the right circumstances for the present 
plan. His absence has greatly affected many aspects including 
this particular issue. 
  [Al-Ruzz] What do you have to say about al-Kikhya's 
continued disappearance? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] On the human level, it was a real tragedy for 
him, his family, his friends, and his fellow strugglers. We 
will undoubtedly miss him, particularly in these circumstances. 
  What did happen? Nobody can know for sure, but I do not 
hesitate to point an accusing finger at the regime as being the 
party behind the disappearance. There are many examples in the 
regime's old and recent record. The resolutions of the 
so-called Revolutionary Committees and al-Qadhdhafi's recent 
speeches confirm the new trend in the regime's way of dealing 
with the opposition. The Libyan regime has a major vested 
interest in al-Kikhya's disappearance at this stage. 
  We have information that the regime will not restrict its 
operations to just kidnapping al-Kikhya. It intends to carry 
out more operations. Al-Qadhdhafi's invitation to Ahmad Jibril 
and Abu-Nidal to Libya was for that purpose. We also have 
information that the regime did not halt its efforts after 
Jibril and Abu-Nidal refused to settle in Libya and that he sent 
Colonel 'Abdallah Hijazi to them and Hijazi met with them and 
offered coordination of operations against the opposition. 
  [Al-Ruzz] How do you assess the recent government changes 
in Libya? 
  [Al-Muqaryif] Before talking about the changes, it suffices, 
in order to discern the tragic conditions of the Libyan people 
under that regime, to examine what went on at the General 
People's Congress and what was said by Abu-Zayd 'Umar Durdah, 
secretary of the General People's Committee, and the ministers. 
Salaries are not being paid and there is no education and no 
medical or other services. 
  The new government bears no particular hallmarks, except 
that 
'Umar al-Muntasir was retained at the Foreign Ministry as 
someone who could help contacts with the West. It also includes 
a number of Revolutionary Committees members with vast 
experience in terrorism such as 'Izz-al-Din al-Hanshiri, 
Muhammad Hijazi, and Ahmad Ibrahim.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 12 (AFP) -- A second and final shipment 
of irradiated fuel was flown out of Iraq to Russia Saturday, a 
UN source here said. 
  The seven-kilogram (15.4-pound) batch was loaded onto a 
Russian Antonov-124 plane in al-Habbaniyah airport, 60 
kilometers (36 miles) west of Baghdad. The plane went to 
Russia, via Kiev, Ukraine, the source added. 
  The fuel's removal was supervised by a seven-member team 
from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) led by Briton Gary 
Dillon. The team arrived in Iraq on February 4, the source said. 
  The experts arranged for the fuel's transport to 
al-Habbaniyah by road convoy, the source said, adding that 
preparatory work had begun on January 9 at a site near Baghdad. 
  On December 5 the IAEA oversaw the removal from Iraq to 
Russia of a first shipment of 33 kilograms (72.6 pounds) of 
irradiated fuel. 
  Baghdad agreed last April to turn over its supplies of 
irradiated fuel under UN Gulf war ceasefire resolutions on the 
disarmament of Iraq. 
  IAEA deputy chief Maurizio Zifferero said at that time the 
removal would cost Iraq several million dollars. 
  The Vienna-based IAEA, a UN agency, began by removing Iraq's 
non-enriched uranium. A dozen kilograms (some 30 pounds) of the 
material was flown out to Russia in November 1993. 
  On February 4, Zifferero said the Iraqi nuclear program was 
"practically neutralized." 
  Dillon said Friday his team had set up two surveillance 
cameras during its week-long mission at a nuclear site that was 
part of Iraq's enriched uranium production program. 
  He said the IAEA experts would return within two months to 
install up to 20 surveillance cameras at two or three more 
sites, under Security Council Resolution 715, which calls for 
the long-term monitoring of Iraq's arms programs.

  [Text] Kuwaiti Parliamentary sources have said that Saddam 
Husayn's regime is now setting impossible conditions for the 
release of the Kuwaiti captives in Iraqi prisons. One of these, 
they said, is the release of the 11 Iraqis now on trial in 
Kuwait in connection with a plan to assassinate former U.S. 
President George Bush. The sources said the regime also wants 
Kuwait not to refer to its prisoners as hostages or detainees, 
but as missing. 
  The sources said Kuwait responded through the Arab League, 
saying that the Iraqis who are now standing trial in Kuwait 
entered their country carrying weapons and bombs (?and tried to 
carry out) assassinations, bombings, and terrorist acts. They 
have confessed to this and are now in the hands of the Kuwaiti 
judiciary. The Kuwaiti captives, on the other hand, are 
prisoners and [words indistinct] because the tyrant's forces 
kidnapped them by force in front of their families and friends 
during the occupation.

<F P=106> [By Khalid 'Abd-al-Rahim] </F>
  [Text] Asif Ali Zardari, personal envoy of Pakistani Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto, has said the three-year-old embargo 
against the Iraqi people is an inhuman crime committed by 
countries that claim to be civilized and to care about human 
rights. 
  In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, Zardari said the fact that the 
embargo has been in place for more than three years confirms the 
barbarity of these nations, which are killing the elderly and 
children through this embargo. The nations which claim to be 
civilized should reconsider their stands and heed international 
appeals for an immediate lifting of the embargo against the 
struggling Iraqi people. They should also have a humanitarian 
view and translate it into action. 
  On the effects of the embargo on the economy of Pakistan, 
Zardari said Pakistan had previously broad trade and economic 
interests with Iraq and the other Arab states. The embargo has 
greatly affected trade in Pakistan. We have lost a great deal 
due to the embargo's impact on trade and economic ties which had 
earlier revived the Pakistani economy. The embargo has harmed 
these interests and inflicted great harm on the Pakistani 
economy, he said. 
  Assessing Iraqi-Pakistani ties, the Pakistani envoy said: 
Iraqi-Pakistani relations date back thousands of years. They 
have always been strong and close. Since a friend in need is a 
friend indeed, Pakistan had to side with Iraq because it is 
experiencing difficult circumstances that require extending all 
kinds of support to it. 
  I also consider Iraq my first country because I come from 
the 
Sind province, which shares deep-rooted relations with Iraq 
since the Islamic conquest. Therefore, the purpose of our visit 
is to enhance relations between the two Muslim peoples and 
friendly countries. 
  On his talks with Iraqi officials, the Pakistani envoy said: 
The talks were conducted in a cordial, frank atmosphere. We 
exchanged views to promote cooperation in the interest of our 
two peoples. 
  Asif Zardari handed a written message to Prime Minister 
Ahmad 
Khudayyir on 9 February addressed from Benazir Bhutto to 
President Saddam Husayn.

  [Text] Basil al-Asad's death was not only a sad occasion at 
which the Lebanese and Syrians could show their love for the 
unofficial successor of President Hafiz al-Asad, it was also an 
occasion to mend Syria's strained relations with some Arab 
states. The PLO exploited Basil's death and quickly sent a 
high-level delegation, led by Faruq Qaddumi, also known as 
Abu-al-Lutf, to clear the air which has been heavily clouded by 
sharp differences following the announcement of the results of 
the secret Oslo talks and tha Declaration of Principles between 
Israel and the PLO. 'Arafat was not satisfied with this step. 
He personally participated in offering condolences to President 
al-Asad to break the ice between the two sides, which has cast a 
heavy shadow on Syrian-PLO relations. 
  Coincidence has also served Syrian-Iraqi ties -- still the 
number one example of hostile relations between Arab regimes. 
Basil al-Asad's death coincided with the convening of a 
conference for Arab agriculture ministers in Damascus. Iraq was 
one of the countries that took part in the conference. 
Observers said Iraq's attendance of the conference, despite the 
fact that it held in Damascus, was a positive sign of Iraq's 
desire to improve relations with Syria. 
  An Arab diplomatic source in Amman said: Apparently, Iraq's 
response to the conference's invitation in Damascus reflects 
positive signs between the two countries that have been 
increasing secretly over the past months. 
  The diplomat told SHIHAN that Iraqi Agriculture Minister 
Bashir 'Alwan Hammadi offered condolences to President al-Asad 
on behalf of Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. This shows 
relations between the two sides are developing to some extent. 
  The diplomat pointed out that the Iraqi minister made 
political contacts with several Syrian officials in Damascus. 
Other Arab agriculture ministers noticed that Minister 'Alwan 
missed several conference sessions, and that some Syrian Foreign 
Ministry officials were seen accompanying him. This means the 
Iraqi minister was holding talks with Syrian officials regarding 
developing relations between the two countries. 
  SHIHAN has learned that Damascus turned down a draft 
resolution proposed by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab 
Emirates, and Bahrain calling for an Arab protocol to exchange 
agricultural products between Arab states, excluding Iraq, in 
accordance with Security Council resolutions. 
  Sources said Syrian Agriculture Minister As'ad Mustafa 
refused even to include the draft on the agenda, telling Gulf 
agriculture ministers that the Arab Agriculture Organization is 
an Arab, and not international, organization and has nothing to 
do with commitment to Security Council resolutions. 
  This Syrian position reflects progress toward improving 
relations with Iraq, which is being done quietly, slowly, and 
away from media clamor.

  [Text] Baghdad, 12 Feb (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH 
has said that U.S. President Clinton's positions toward the 
Arabs since the bombardment of Baghdad have been part of a 
scheme designed to pulverize the Arab nation and eliminate Islam. 
  In its editorial today, the paper criticizes the state of 
collapse and retreat that has characterized Clinton since he 
assumed power in the United States. Facing a host of ethical 
and financial scandals, which the U.S. media has drowned him in, 
Clinton has kneeled down until his forehead has begun to touch 
the ground in order to appease the media and secure their 
silence over his scandals, the paper said. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH added: Last week, Clinton chose to lie to the 
Congress regarding Iraq. This week, he chose Libya with the aim 
of inflaming the Congress against the Arabs and Muslims. 
  It is known that Clinton has asked the Congress to impose 
more sanctions on Libya on the pretext that it threatens U.S. 
national security. This is the same formula Clinton used last 
week claiming that Iraq is trying to rebuild its nuclear weapons. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH recalls the U.S. President's comment on 
Sarajevo's heinous massacre. He said the United States cannot 
unilaterally intervene to end the massacres there. The paper 
vehemently assailed the arrogant U.S. position on what the 
Bosnian Muslims are facing, noting that Clinton is not ashamed 
of admitting that the indifference toward what is taking place 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina emanates from the fact that the it is not 
a country that produces oil or strategic items. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH regrets the fact that human rights issues, 
from 
the viewpoint of the world's superpower, are based on the 
principle of sheer material interests. This demonstrates their 
new approach toward implementing a criminal Malthusian policy 
based on the mass annihilation of humans. The paper asserted 
that these proposals by the White House administration reveal 
the criminal nature of the U.S. strategy. This strategy is 
based on noninterference in world events depending on two 
points: First, whether there is a threat to U.S. national 
security; second, whether there are funds and military 
capability outside the United States; in other words, others' 
resources are used to achieve U.S. objectives. 
  The paper urges the one billion Muslims, including the 200 
million Arabs, to adopt a militant position in order to prevent 
the crimes of the new Malthusianism and stop the isolation of 
Arab and Muslim countries.

<F P=106> ["Talk With Live Ammunition" column by Ahmad Sabri] </F>
  [Text] Last Saturday, the U.S. Senate passed a bill 
banning arms sales to Arab states that are committed to the 
boycott of "Israel." 
  This legislation, which is expected to be approved by the 
U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. President Clinton, will 
ban arms sales and the offer of any U.S. military services or 
advice to any Arab state that tries to convince U.S. companies 
to comply with the Arab boycott of Israel. 
  This U.S. bill is the latest in a series of measures that 
seek to eventually end the Arab boycott of the Zionist entity 
and to intimidate states and companies that comply with this 
boycott. 
  Republican Senator Hank Brown claims the continued Arab 
boycott of this entity harms the efforts to establish peace in 
the Middle East. However, the contrary is true. This is 
because the new U.S. legislation is designed to protect Israel 
against the effects of this boycott and shows full bias toward 
this entity. It encourages the Zionist entity to persist in 
rejecting UN Security Council resolutions and continuing the 
policy of settlement building, repression, and torture against 
our people in occupied Palestine. 
  The Arab economic boycott of the enemy was and still is a 
necessary measure to protect pan-Arab security against this 
entity that was planted by the colonialist West in the heart of 
our Arab homeland to implement and protect the West's policies 
and to act as its racist, aggressive base against our Arab 
nation. 
  Any talk about ending the boycott of Israeli harms the Arab 
nation's vital interests. Its danger stems from the fact that 
it will lead to relinquishing and ceding the pan-Arab constants 
governing the conflict with the Zionist entity. 
  Therefore, the U.S. legislation and insistence on passing it 
in the wake of Arab concessions in the course of the 
Arab-Zionist conflict ultimately aims at shattering these 
constants, represented by the boycott and its pan-Arab 
justifications, in a bid to impose capitulation on the Arab 
nation in accordance with racist Zionist concepts. 
  Despite the attempts by the United States and its "Israeli" 
ally to expand the circle of capitulation and to expedite the 
political settlement process, all signs indicate that failure 
and a dead end is awaiting them because of the arrogance of the 
racist Zionists and the encouragement of the United states, 
which cares about nothing but its interests. Any talk about a 
just, honorable, and comprehensive peace to restore Arab rights 
and territories is nothing but an illusion, something which is 
being proved by events. 
  As shown by the epic of the Mother of Battles and its great 
objectives, the Arab nation's only option is to stick to 
pan-Arab constants, the unity of their destiny, rejection of 
foreign hegemony, refusal to yield to intimidation and the 
policy of imposing the status quo, resisting all forms of 
extortion and containment, and insisting on self-reliance to 
epitomize the Arab nation's unity and protect its pan-Arab 
security against any penetration. 
  What has been taking place in Iraq since its militant 
confrontation against the U.S.-Atlantic-Zionist military 
aggression and the subsequent hostile chapters genuinely 
expresses the Arab nation's spirit rejecting capitulation and 
aspiring for a prosperous future. The outcome of the Mother of 
Battles has begun to concern those seeking to impose 
custodianship on our nation and to implant despair in our souls. 
Therefore, they are anxiously attempting to contain this light 
coming out from the land of Mesopotamia to reach all the free 
ones in our nation and the world.

  [Text] Amman, Feb 12 (AFP) -- Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn's powerful son-in-law, Lieutenant-General Husayn Kamil 
Hasan al-Majid, has been hospitalised here, medical officials 
said Saturday. 
  The opposition Iraqi National Congress said that Husayn 
Kamil, 36, was undergoing emergency treatment for a brain tumour. 
  Medical officials would not divulge what was wrong with him, 
but confirmed he had been admitted to hospital. 
  He holds the title "special advisor to the president" with 
the rank of minister, and reports directly to Saddam. 
  He was minister of defence, and took over at the industry 
ministry last September. He is head of the Military Industrial 
Organisation, a key post overseeing arms production, and is one 
of the most powerful men in the Iraqi government. 
  Despite his relatively youth, he was regarded as the father 
of Iraq's chemical, bacteriological, ballistics and nuclear 
weapons programmes, which have been destroyed under UN 
resolutions following the Gulf war three years ago. 
  He is married to Saddam's eldest daughter, Raghad.

  [Text] A report from Mosul says that hundreds of antiregime 
leaflets have been distributed by the heroes of the Islamic 
resistance inside the city and on the roads leading to it. 
  The report says that the leaflets denounced tyrant Saddam's 
continued control of the ruling process and his execution of the 
officers who took part or were suspected of taking part in the 
coup attempt. The leaflets also urged the citizens to boycott 
the ruling regime, declare disobedience, refuse to carry out 
orders, and avoid joining the unfair ruling party. They 
threatened further armed operations against the regime's 
henchmen, associates, and institutions.

  [Text] As part of the campaign to liquidate the officers 
who took part in the coup attempt in Tikrit in late July, 20 
senior officers in the Republican Guards were recently expelled 
and arrested. Some of these were even executed by the guards' 
intelligence organ, our sources in Baghdad said. 
  The families of the executed officers were notified by the 
authorities. However, the bodies were not handed over to them. 
Meanwhile, the authorities warned the families against 
publicizing the issue or holding memorial ceremonies for the 
deceased. 
  Panic prevailed among the Republican Guards as a result of 
this campaign. Many officers and soldiers escaped for fear of 
liquidation.

  [Text] Baghdad -- Over the next few days, the al-Rashid and 
al-Rafidayn Banks will begin pumping dollars into the market to 
create a balance between supply and demand, to lower the price 
of the dollar against the Iraqi dinar, and to effect stable food 
prices. A responsible source told AL-JUMHURIYAH that the coming 
phase will witness further measures to bolster the value of the 
Iraqi dinar in the market and ensure that the speculators and 
parasites who have caused the rise in the dollar exchange rates 
are wiped out. 
  The source said that citizens are allowed to own dollars 
provided the buying and selling of dollars is confined to money 
changing offices and the al-Rashid and al-Rafidayn Banks in 
order to facilitate the process of money changing and protect 
the citizens against speculators. He noted that the State has 
allowed citizens to bring in any amount of foreign currency and 
that it has given them the opportunity to buy it from, or sell 
it to, designated parties, or, alternatively, it has given them 
the chance to invest it in the country. 
  The banking source said that the dollar exchange rate has 
nothing to do with Western media lies and rumors, which are 
circulated by the mean speculators in the local markets. 
  Yesterday, the dollar exchange rate was fixed at companies 
authorized to sell or buy currencies and at the branches of the 
al- Rashid and al-Rafidayn Banks. Al-Rashid Bank has designated 
six branches in Baghdad and the governorates to buy and sell 
foreign currency in accordance with the exchange rate and as of 
5 February. These branches are: al-Shurjah, Jamilah, al-Sa'dun, 
and al-Mansur central market, as well as in the Ninawa and 
al-Basrah Governorates. 
  The Central Bank has also authorized al-Rafidayn Bank 
branches in al-Harithiyah, Karradat Mariyam, and al-Kifah, and 
its main branch, as well as the Bank's branches in al-Basrah and 
Ninawa to begin the buying and selling operation as of 5 
February.

  [Text] Dahham 'Abd-al-Rashid, head of the Financial Control 
Bureau, has said the decision to limit dealing in foreign 
currencies to officially licensed companies and banks is the 
most important step toward controlling speculation in the Iraqi 
dinar's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. He stressed, 
however, that the decision came late. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, 'Abd-al-Rashid 
said: Most countries in the world, if not all, have companies 
and offices that deal with foreign currencies in a regular way 
and are subject to the control and supervision of the competent 
authorities. It is difficult to predict the extent of the 
success that will come from applying this decision, which every 
citizen that cares for his people and nation wishes to see. We 
are certain that the experience and insight of leaders of the 
competent state agencies will ensure the success of this 
decision, which will produce positive results for the national 
economy and for all the parties that have an interest in the 
decision. 
  He stressed that the primary indicator of the success of 
this 
decision will be the stabilization of the dinar's exchange rate. 
He explained that the long-term objective of the decision is to 
improve the exchange rate against foreign currencies so that we 
can buy more for one Iraqi dinar than we can buy now. 
  Asked by AL-JUMHURIYAH about the reasons for the sharp 
fluctuations in the exchange rate, the director of the Financial 
Control Bureau said the main reason is the deliberate subversive 
attempts carried out by foreign and domestic parties, who took 
advantage of the circumstances of the unjust economic blockade 
and the weak points of the Iraqi economy, which used to rely 
heavily on oil exports and on importing commodities and services 
from abroad. These parties, he said, succeeded in bringing about 
fluctuations in the Iraqi dinar's exchange rate against the U.S. 
dollar and other foreign currencies. They have also succeeded 
in producing price hikes on commodities and services, thus 
laying a heavy burden on the shoulders of citizens with limited 
incomes. 
  He added that the remedy for the current inflation is based 
on maintaining prices at their current level, or even bringing 
them down to a lower, constant level, and on long-term action. 
The action should start now to lower prices to the previous 
levels in Iraq or to the international levels, as well as 
keeping the inflation rate below 20 percent, as is the case in 
advanced industrial countries. 
  Regarding the price hikes on commodities, Dahham 
'Abd-al-Rashid said that they are due to speculation, gambling, 
rumors, and psychological warfare staged against Iraqi citizens. 
The main reason for price hikes, he said, is the low supply of 
commodities compared to the demand and the purchasing power 
created by the surplus cash liquidity. He said the imbalance 
between the supply of commodities and the real demand is due to 
the low output of local products of commodities and services, 
including the industrial and agricultural products and so forth. 
The imbalance is also due to the fact that Iraq has lost all of 
its foreign currency assets and the revenues it used to make out 
of its oil exports before 2 August 1990. Thus, the country lost 
the ability to import basic commodities and services needed by 
its citizens. 
  Dahham stressed that the solution requires increasing 
production first, and then organizing the increase in real 
income to correspond to the increase in production. He 
explained that Iraq, from the 1970's, should have adopted an 
organized policy of income and prices. Income is not limited to 
wages and salaries, he said, but should also include profits and 
their distribution, whether in individual enterprises or 
companies. Taxes and other financial and monetary instruments 
must be used to implement this policy to achieve a balance 
between prices and incomes and improve their levels to ensure a 
fair distribution of wealth among the various individuals, 
groups, and segments of society.

  [Text] Amman, Feb 13 (AFP) -- Police shot dead around 30 
Iraqi foreign currency dealers in central Baghdad during a raid, 
travellers from Iraq told AFP here Sunday. 
  The dealers fled to nearby flats on January 24 when they saw 
the police arriving in the al-Harisiyah area, where they were 
exchanging money. 
  The police opened fire, killing about 30 of them, the 
sources 
said. 
  Another 10 dealers surrendered, and were still in jail, they 
said. 
  The raid came two days after a warning published in the 
daily 
Babil, which blamed the collapse of the Iraqi dinar on street 
dealers, and called for them to be punished. 
  The daily is run by President Saddam Husayn's son 'Udayy. 
  The sources said the dollar was changing hands on the black 
market for 230 dinars the day of the raid, but the rate now was 
265 to the dollar. 
  The official rate is one dinar to 3.2 dollars. 
  On January 27 the deputy governor of the central bank, 'Asim 
Muhammad Salih, announced a ban on foreign currency trading by 
street dealers.

  [Text] Our sources in Iraqi Kurdistan have obtained 
reliable information, affirming that Saddam's criminal son 
'Udayy is imposing his control on all sources of local and 
foreign trade in Iraq through a network of merchants directly 
connected to intelligence organs. 
  In the past few months, the number of merchants who could 
deal in the Jordanian markets was specified. The list contained 
merchants known for their links with Saddam's intelligence 
organs and 'Udayy himself. The reports add that a large number 
of wholesalers who supply the Iraqi market with food, clothing, 
and other consumer goods were excluded and replaced by others 
who are closely linked to the ruling family. 
  In another development, the money-changing market in Baghdad 
was recently the scene of a large-scale arrest campaign. The 
campaign was launched by the security agencies at 'Udayy's 
orders. A total of 15 money changers were executed. This led 
to an increase in the hard currency rates against the Iraqi 
dinar.

<F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn at the Royal Hashemite Court in Amman </F>
on 13 February--recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
You are welcome, brothers, in this house of yours. Many happy 
returns. God bless you all. I take boundless pride in our 
brotherhood. One always recalls the memories of the long, hard 
march and the challenges we faced. We have great faith that God 
will help us serve the country and the generations to come and 
fulfill our duties in a manner that will satisfy God almighty 
and our conscience. 
  I am certain the brothers have a great deal of information 
on 
what has happened, and is happening at this phase in our 
nation's life and our life in this country. There may be, 
however, an opportunity to enter into some details and listen to 
your observations on what is happening. We are, here, one 
family. I am happy to meet with this respectable group of 
brothers on this day in particular, with the king's private 
council and with the men, the builders who built this country. 
You, members of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee, are 
welcome in this house of yours. 
  This is a critical and hard phase in terms of the efforts it 
requires from all of us. Thank God, this is the country of the 
big, one family of all origins. We are determined to maintain 
our national unity and our achievements as far as allowing the 
individual to share in shouldering his responsibility, 
chartering the road to the future through democracy, shura, and 
respect and protection of the Constitution and the National 
Charter. That charter was formulated by the children of this 
homeland and sets a course we must follow in the present and 
future. 
  The individual is very important, indeed. God willing, 
Jordan will be the state of institutions. This means 
participation by all people to shoulder their responsibility, 
with awareness and loyalty, and to prepare the road to the 
future. Additionally, we must continue our efforts to prevent 
any party from striking us in the heart, in terms of what we 
have succeeded in achieving, including democracy and 
participation by all people in shouldering their responsibility. 
  Through our work, we want to set an example to our brothers 
in this part of the world. Probably, this is not to the 
satisfaction of many quarters, because they do not know the true 
objective and goal we seek to achieve; that is to succeed in our 
course and reach our objectives and goals. 
  Therefore, the phase requires a great deal of vigilance, 
awareness, and cohesion by all in the face of all the attempts 
that may seek to distort the image of this country and its 
achievements, or march on a road that might lead -- in the view 
of some people -- to a reaction. We are committed to the path 
and the course we have chosen. We must preserve it. This is a 
trust everyone must protect. Thank God, all Jordanians have 
always demonstrated a degree of awareness -- which they gained 
through the long hard march -- of all that may threaten that 
march. But, in my view, and based on what we have seen 
recently, there has to be an extra degree of vigilance and 
awareness, a vigilance that will prevent any damage, God forbid. 
  We must look after the interests of the individual and his 
rights, as well as paying attention to the environment and 
whatever falls within the realm of our responsibility toward the 
coming generations. In a larger context, we decided, following 
a national convention here, to take the road of peace, beginning 
in Madrid, along with our brothers in the Arab world, 
particularly the Palestinians. In 1974, the Rabat summit 
decided that our Palestinian brothers should take charge of 
their own affairs in compliance with their own and the Arab 
nation's wishes at that time. Some of you here now took part in 
that meeting. Our position is clear. As of 1974, we promoted 
an implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242, which 
we co-authored in tough circumstances, and which was the best 
possible arrangement we could get at that time. Thereafter, our 
Palestinian brothers took responsibility for themselves. They 
have our full support. 
  Things then evolved in a way favoring a settlement 
compatible 
with a world trend. We began in Madrid. The Jordanian umbrella 
was a vehicle for our Palestinian brothers to run their affairs, 
insofar as their rights on their national soil are concerned. 
We agreed to take part in various conferences, including the 
multilateral talks, because we wanted the world to be involved 
in drawing the outlines of peace. Things developed in rapid 
succession until we came to the point where we could furl the 
umbrella and relegate it to the closet of history, so our 
Palestinian brothers might exercise their right to speak for 
themselves. Then, there was last September's Washington session 
and the agreement, followed by our signing of the agenda that 
addressed issues bearing on us here in Jordan, without 
prejudicing our brothers' rights on matters previously handled 
by us. I am speaking about Resolution 242 and the Arab 
territories conquered in 1967. The responsibility for these was 
switched to our Palestinian brothers, who can count on our full 
support as they pursue their rights. 
  There have been many proposals and attempts to get Jordan to 
sign a peace treaty with Israel before details are worked out. 
Our response was an outright rejection. 
  We stand with a just and comprehensive peace, although we 
are now dealing with our issues in this country, as well as its 
rights concerning occupied territories in the south and in the 
north. Jordanian sovereignty over them should be regained. 
Regarding water, which is also a topic on the agenda, a formula 
should be worked out in which we can know our country's share 
and the shares of other parties concerned. The question of 
human beings as well as other topics should also be discussed. 
We believe peace is a goal. It is our duty to seek to reach it. 
  However, there will never be peace unless all these issues 
are resolved in a satisfactory and comfortable way. Peace comes 
at the end and not at the beginning. Then, all the elements 
that should be available to achieve peace should be discussed. 
We believe anyone who thinks of signing a peace treaty and then 
begins discussing details cannot reach peace, but will 
surrender. People will then try to improve their conditions and 
circumstances. We regret such a situation. We will never 
accept such a view or concept. 
  Meetings and negotiations on the agenda are continuing in an 
attempt to deal with all the aspects and issues pertaining to 
us, through continued dialogue in Washington and other parts of 
the world. We believe the other tracks will also move. They 
are actually moving, particularly the Syrian-Israeli track and 
the Lebanese-Israeli track, in addition to the Palestinian side 
which is working continuously. 
  We tried, and we will continue to try, to reach the required 
level to face the challenge and to face up to our 
responsibilities toward the present and the future, particularly 
toward our Palestinian brethren. There should be coordination, 
not only in terms of titles, but also details, in every area in 
order to extend our support and talk with one voice and in one 
logic to serve the goals we seek. 
  The picture is improving, but I cannot say that we are 100 
percent satisfied with all the aspects that should be dealt 
with. There is a serious intention to achieve this. Therefore, 
we will march on this path. We will insist on total 
coordination on issues of mutual interest until a situation 
arises in which everyone in this country can choose either 
membership in this one family to which we belong, or 
repatriation, or compensation. We are one family. We should 
adhere to all that has united us in the past. This is a duty at 
this critical stage, which expresses the fact that we are one 
family regardless of any consideration. 
  We are coordinating with our brothers in fraternal Syria. 
Regarding Lebanon, I also believe there is progress in the right 
direction. I believe there will be progress on the 
Syrian-Israeli track. Israel will have to recognize Syria's 
sovereignty over its occupied territories and over all of Golan. 
  On the other hand, it has been said Israel has no claims on 
any inch of Lebanese territory. Israel's only demand is to 
guarantee its security which, I believe, can be provided. 
  We, here, have many issues and matters that should be 
discussed and agreed upon before reaching the phase in which we 
will be reassured that all matters have been tackled. 
  I believe that between now and the end of the year -- 
perhaps 
by the beginning of next year -- we might find that progress has 
been achieved on all tracks to reach the objective that is 
sought. 
  What is this objective, as I, as well as my brothers, see 
it? 
The objective is to move from the current situation to a 
completely different one. The objective is that the coming 
generation will not live as we lived, that is, a life in which 
they will not be reassured about what will come in the future. 
We lived from one day to another. The objective is to see 
people living in an atmosphere that provides them with 
opportunities to advance in their life and to enjoy stability, 
democracy, participation in decisionmaking, and peace, that we 
hope will be just and honorable and accepted by the coming 
generations. The objective is to see that all opportunities 
will be available to all to achieve their aspirations and 
objectives, to live a free and honorable life, to remain 
steadfast on their land, and to exercise their rights in this 
life. 
  We want to leave for the coming generations opportunities of 
which we were deprived. We believe our people have enough 
potential, if they are given opportunities to advance and to 
exercise their rights in normal circumstances. What makes us 
very satisfied is that our country and our people are not in 
danger and that this position -- which we have safeguarded from 
the beginning as a genuine Arab -- is not subject to any 
possibilities like those we have been confronting throughout our 
life. 
  Our homeland is the homeland of the free people and its 
people's heads are high in the sky. Our people bow only to 
almighty God. We do not bargain over principle. We are not 
lenient vis-a-vis our rights. We seek to fully restore rights 
to their owners on their national soil and to carry our duties 
the best way we can for the sake of the coming generations. 
  As regards Jerusalem and our holy places, we cannot forget 
them for one moment. We have no choice but to continue 
shouldering our full responsibilities in terms of looking after 
them on behalf of our Islamic nation. 
  As regards Gaza and Jericho, if the issue is the beginning 
of 
the implementation of 242, the time will come when Jerusalem 
will be the Palestinian-Israeli meeting place. However, as 
regards our holy places -- toward which we have shouldered our 
responsibilities and which belong to all Muslims throughout the 
world, in the past, in the present, and in the future -- we 
found we had to propose and to endeavor to choose, from within 
our Islamic group, a good group of people who would represent 
all Islamic sects. This group of people, God willing, will not 
be politicized. In other words, they will not be affiliated 
with any school or be supportive of any one country's policy. 
We will support them with all our potential, because these holy 
places belong to all the Islamic world. 
  What we have accomplished is an honor, whether in terms of 
rescuing these holy places in the first place or in seeking to 
preserve them despite all that has happened and all that we 
faced. 
  We encourage dialogue among religions and demand that in 
terms of sovereignty the holy places be under the sovereignty of 
God almighty and his worshipers under future circumstances. We 
hope that this will happen, so the only recognized sovereignty 
over these holy places will be that of God. We will seek to 
gain God's satisfaction. We will continue to fear him. The 
positive results of this will not be confined just to this part 
of the world, but will have effects on mankind throughout the 
world. 
  Thanks be to God, during this month we will celebrate the 
completion of the project we have followed from the beginning, 
namely, the restoration of the holy dome of the rock. We will 
continue to support our brethren to the best of our abilities in 
terms of their needs and desires. 
  In my opinion, Palestine can either lean on this solid wall 
here [Jordan] or else lean in the other direction in the 
upcoming critical stage. Palestine represents our kinsfolk, our 
people, hopes, and aspirations. We are willing to carry out our 
duty. We never hesitated to do so at any time. We hope God 
will grant us success in cooperating with our brethren to 
support them in any way that can lead to wellbeing and success, 
God willing. With the help of almighty God, there will be 
nothing but (?success). 
  Incidents took place over here in the recent past. These 
include the loss of one of the homeland's sons in Lebanon in a 
grotesque, mean action. However, I am pleased to inform you 
that our brethren in Lebanon and Syria moved with us to the best 
of their abilities. This incident was directed against Lebanon, 
just as it was directed against us. This evil act encroached on 
the sovereignty, security, and stability of Lebanon, just as it 
grieved us in causing the loss of one of our good sons. 
  In a telephone conversation a few days ago, my brother his 
excellency the Lebanese president said that all those 
responsible for this incident had been arrested and that justice 
will take its course. He made a point of contacting me 
personally so that I would not hear this from any other source 
before hearing it from the president himslef. Naturally, we 
thanked him. We thank all our brothers for their contributions 
to exposing this crime and its dimensions and those who are 
responsible for it and who instigated it. 
  Regrettably this group, in particular, has in the past 
committed against us and against our diplomatic missions such 
crimes. On this occasion, it seems orders were issued from an 
Arab capital where the head of this criminal organization is 
hiding. Scores of questions have been raised in the past about 
this organization. All the details must be made available to 
the people. 
  As regards our domestic arena, the security agencies have, 
praise be to God, acted at the required level to face and 
confront some attempts to harm the image of this country, as 
well as criminal schemes hatched to inflict further harm. The 
question, with all its dimensions, is now being investigated. 
But we have to warn that there are certain parties that can 
reach our young men, who are not in a position to distinguish 
between good and bad, and influence them through various means 
and ways and drive them to commit crimes and carry out certain 
acts. What is even more dangerous is the fact that these 
parties try to address the point of weakness, which is also the 
point of strength, in everyone of us, that is, religion and 
faith. As far as the results are concerned, all these crimes 
have nothing to do with religion or faith. We noted on several 
occasions in the past what is being hatched against us, and 
against our religion, faith, and Islam. We also drew attention 
to the duty we all must fulfill, that is, not to allow things to 
go beyond the limits of what is logical and acceptable. The 
pulpits in mosques are the pulpits of God's messenger, God's 
prayers and peace by upon him, and of the legal guardians. We 
believe that, as of now, we should not allow anyone, any more, 
to exploit them for purposes that have nothing to do with our 
doctrine and our religion. Islam shall remain clear and pure, 
since this is what the moderate nation the Muslim nation is all 
about. 
  One cannot stand idly by over the attempts to drive people 
to 
crime and murder. We must warn against another fact. There is a 
small group of infiltrators who try to damage the entire picture 
and everything that has been achieved and won. I urge our 
people in our country to be vigilant and cautious and to close 
the door to these groups that have connections with foreign 
parties. Many doubts are cast about these connections. Their 
contacts may be within a framework broader than that of our 
Muslim world. When we have enough information, it must be 
presented to the people so they will know about what is going on. 
  All members of this one family -- Muslims and Christians -- 
are Jordanians who must band together and pull the rug from 
under whoever seeks to discredit this country and its 
achievements. Jordan must remain a strong and steadfast 
fortress that serves Palestine and our brothers and 
well-intentioned people throughout the great Arab homeland. We 
pray that God may grant us success and guidance, and that these 
are the results. 
  We are quite confident that life and death are in the lap of 
the gods. Our life span is fated by God. What we are after is 
God almighty's satisfaction and his help in allowing us to 
succeed, as long as we live, to fulfill our duties so our heads 
can remain held high. 
  I thank you for this visit and meeting. If you have any 
questions or comments, I'd be grateful and happy. 
  I thank you so much, brothers. Thanks be to God, this 
country is doing its bit and its duty. God willing, our 
brothers from Yemen will get together. They sought our help in 
their endeavor to maintain Yemen's unity and map out the outline 
of a promising future for a cherished part of our great Arab 
homeland, and we have been receptive. We will be glad to see 
Amman once more play the role of the capital of accord and 
reconciliation, when we play host to them quite soon. It will 
count as a major achievement. For us, it will mean more than 
just an effort we exerted or a duty we fulfilled. Hopefully, it 
will usher in a resolution of intra-Arab differences within the 
framework of an Arab family, as we have always wanted and worked 
for. It will be an opportunity for each of us to do their duty 
by our kinsfolk and brothers. We pray for success from God. 
  In regard to our Armed Forces, they will continue to have 
our 
maximum support within the limits of our resources. I recently 
visited the Jordanian contingent within the international 
peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia. I was impressed by 
their high morale and the humane, but yet firm, way in which 
they conducted themselves. I myself was surprised to learn that 
next to France we have the second largest contingent there. We 
have been asked to contribute an even larger force, but I said 
we could not commit any more troops to that operation. We must 
thank God that the Jordanian soldier's character and moral 
standards and commitment to responsibility have earned him 
universal respect.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn and Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat held a meeting today attended by His Highness 
Crown Prince Hassan. A number of top officials from both sides 
attended. 
  The Palestinian president briefed His Majesty King Husayn on 
the outcome of the negotiations between the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides held in Cairo during the past few days. He 
explained the points on which the Palestinians and Israeli sides 
have agreed as well as the points that are still pending and 
need further discussion. 
  His Majesty King Husayn affirmed to the Palestinian 
president 
the importance of continued coordination and consultation 
because this coordination enables Arabs, particularly 
Palestinians, to restore their rights and reinforce their 
negotiating stand. 
  His Majesty King Husayn noted Jordan's constant stand based 
on supporting the Palestinian brothers in every way possible 
until they achieve their rights on their national soil and as 
part of an effort to alleviate the suffering of the kinsfolk 
under occupation. 
  Also attending the meeting were Dr.'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, 
the prime minister; Al-Sharif Zayd Bin-SHakir, chief of the 
Royal Court; Marwan al-Qasim, his majesty the king's political 
adviser; Dr. Khalid al-Karaki, his majesty's adviser; Dr. Jawad 
al-'Anani, minister of information; Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, 
deputy minister of state for foreign affairs, Dr. Fayiz 
al-Tarawinah, Jordan's ambassador in Washington and head of the 
Jordanian negotiating delegation. 
  Attending on the Palestinian side were Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, 
head of the PLO Information Department; Ahmad Quray', head of 
the Economic Department; Akram Haniyah, President 'Arafat's 
special adviser; Faysal al-Husayni, head of the Palestinian 
negotiating team; and the Palestinian ambassador in Amman. 
  Afterwards, His Majesty King Husayn and Palestinian 
President 
Yasir 'Arafat held a closed meeting for some time. Following 
the meeting, his majesty the king and President 'Arafat 
responded to reporters' questions. 
  The Palestinian president left Amman this afternoon. His 
Majesty King Husayn and His Highness Crown Prince Hasan bade him 
farewell. Also present to bid him farewell were Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, the prime minister; al-Sharif Zayd 
Bin-Shakir, chief of the Royal Court; Marwan al-Qasim, his 
majesty the king's political adviser; Dr. Khalid al-Karaki, his 
majesty's adviser; the minister of information; the deputy 
minister of state for foreign affairs; Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, 
Jordan's ambassador in Washington; and the Palestinian 
ambassador in Amman. 
  Upon bidding President 'Arafat farewell, His Majesty King 
Husayn made statements to reporters. He said: 
  [Begin Husayn recording] Through this short visit to his 
second homeland, His Excellency President 'Arafat provided us 
with a good opportunity to be briefed on what has taken place 
and, indeed, he did so. It was also an opportunity for me to 
affirm that our stand is constant in terms of fully supporting 
our kinsfolk and brothers in Palestine -- as he is the leader of 
their march -- to the best of our abilities during these 
circumstances and in the long run, God willing. I have noticed 
and I am pleased that our contacts are continuous and 
coordination between us is being upgraded to the level required 
to confront challenges and fully shoulder our responsibilities. 
[end recording] 
  Upon his departure from Amman, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat made statements to reporters. He said: 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording] First of all, I would like to 
thank 
his majesty the king for his warm embracement of all our issues 
and problems. He also shoulders even our concerns. I would 
like to express my thanks and appreciation to you. Of course, 
this is not something strange coming from him. He is always 
shouldering the concerns of the one Jordanian-Palestinian 
family. We feel proud and are grateful to his majesty the king 
for shouldering this family's concerns in the face of all 
changes and developments. 
  I am pleased to be here today to put his majesty the king in 
the picture on developments and the talks I held with Peres, as 
well as talks between the Israeli delegation and the Palestinian 
delegation. I presented to his majesty the king the official 
documents that were signed. Moreover, I listened to his good 
views and ideas on confronting all future issues which we should 
address through joint efforts and action. This 
Jordanian-Palestinian family is a united family under his 
majesty the king's continuous care, God willing. [end recording]

  [Text] Palestine President Yasir 'Arafat left Amman this 
afternoon after a short visit and talks with his majesty the 
king. The Palestinian president briefed his majesty on 
yesterday's agreement with Israel on security issues that have 
blocked the start of Palestinian self-rule. 
  The king and Mr. 'Arafat met at the Queen Alia Airport 
outside Amman, where the Palestinian president handed his 
majesty a copy of the agreement. His majesty reaffirmed 
Jordan's absolute and unchanging support of the Palestinian 
people to regain their rights on their national soil. The two 
leaders then held a closed door meeting for further discussions 
of bilateral ties and regional developments. Following the 
talks, his majesty the king said coordination with the 
Palestinians was rising to the required level, while President 
'Arafat urged the need for joint action with Jordan. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Ruba 'Assaf in progress] ...PLO? 
  [Husayn] We are very happy indeed that we have had this 
opportunity presented today by the visit of my brother President 
'Arafat. And he has been kind enough to come and explain to us 
all that has happened. And I believe that we are witnessing the 
emergence of a strong mechanism, hopefully of coordination on 
all issues. And I had the opportunity to reiterate our total 
support for our Palestinian brethren under the leadership of the 
president, and our very strong commitment on top of desire to 
help and support in any way we can the process in the difficult 
times ahead. 
  ['Arafat] We stress upon this very important the relation 
between the one Jordanian-Palestinian family under his 
supervision and under his auspices. [sentence as heard] And we 
have to strengthen more and more our coordination in all fields. 
  ['Assaf] When do you expect to sign a final agreement on 
Gaza 
and Jericho? When do you plan to enter Gaza and Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] Still, there is some issues has to be discussed 
between the two committees, especially those issues which are 
still discussion in Taba and in the Economic Committee in Paris. 
And after that, we hope that in the end of this month, we hope 
that we have something to make the final draft, which will be 
signed by me and Mr. Rabin. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Husayn-'Arafat Meeting"] </F>
  [Text] The quick working visit of Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat to Jordan to brief his brother, His Majesty King 
Husayn, on the outcome of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
held in Cairo, comes as a reaffirmation of the vital historic 
relations between the Jordanian and Palestinian political 
leaderships. This visit also stressed the deep and strong 
bilateral understanding and coordination between them. 
  The Jordanian leadership has always been eager for 
coordination, particularly with the Palestinian side. Moreover, 
Jordan has continued to call incessantly for increasing the 
level of coordination on every occasion, including the 
Palestinian president's visit yesterday. His Majesty King 
Husayn once again emphasized the importance of continued 
coordination and consultations among all Arab parties, 
especially since such coordination will enable the Palestinian 
side, in particular, to consolidate its negotiating position and 
regain its rights. 
  Jordan welcomed the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles that was signed approximately four months ago. While 
maintaining its adherence to the option of a just and 
comprehensive peace, Jordan can only express its support for the 
recent Cairo agreement. This is because the agreement is a 
strong mechanism for implementing the Declaration of Principles, 
and it will open the way for Israeli military withdrawal from 
Gaza Strip and some areas in the occupied West Bank. 
  The Husayn-'Arafat meeting yesterday, and the deep fraternal 
talks the two leader held, were a good opportunity for Jordan to 
stress its constant position of extending full and absolute 
support for the Palestinian kinsfolk and brothers. At the same 
time, this meeting was another opportunity for the Palestinian 
president to express the Palestinian people's thanks and 
gratitude to His Majesty King Husayn for his courageous 
positions in sharing the Palestinians concerns and defending the 
causes of the one Jordanian-Palestinian family.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Jordan does not anticipate having any 
problems with the security related issues entailed in the 
agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
and Israel signed in Cairo on Wednesday [9 February]. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the JORDAN TIMES 
Friday that because the PLO had signed a security agreement with 
Jordan in mid-January "we presume that Jordanian security 
considerations are calculated into the PLO-Israeli agreement." 
  Well-informed Jordanian sources also said that initial 
reading of the PLO-Israel document showed it to be 
"satisfactory." 
  The sources did not elaborate, but one said that "it 
appeared 
to support the Jordanian negotiating position" although a "more 
thorough reading of the document is needed." 
  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat visited Amman Thursday for a 
short 
stopover during which he met with His Majesty King Husayn and 
briefed him on the accord he reached with Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres. He also handed over a copy of the Cairo 
agreement to the King. 
  This visit, albeit short, was apparently intended to prevent 
the kind of tension that arose after the PLO surprised the 
Kingdom by announcing the Oslo agreement without prior serious 
coordination with Jordan. 
  King Husayn has repeatedly called on the PLO to coordinate 
positions with the Kingdom and until last week was saying 
coordination was not of the level needed. 
  Jordanian officials, although still critical that there was 
no synchronisation of steps by the PLO with Jordan before 
reaching the Cairo agreement, were positively encouraged by Mr. 
'Arafat's stopover in Amman to brief King Husayn immediately 
after the signing of the accord. 
  The King and Mr. 'Arafat held a short meeting at the Queen 
Alia International Airport after which King Husayn said that 
"coordination and consultations are continuing (between the PLO 
and Jordan) and are of the level needed to face the challenges 
and meet the responsibilities fully." 
  The King said that Mr. 'Arafat's visit to Amman "was a good 
opportunity to brief us on what happened," adding that it was 
also an opportune time "to reaffirm (to 'Arafat) that our 
position has not changed in our absolute and full support for 
our family and brothers in Palestine and with all our strength 
and capabilities." 
  Mr. 'Arafat told reporters after the meeting that he was 
"happy and proud to have had this opportunity to discuss with 
His Majesty many important issues, especially the negotiations 
that took place in Cairo." 
  "I have listened to His Majesty's thoughts and ideas on ways 
to deal with future issues which we must meet as one and through 
a joint effort," Mr. 'Arafat said, adding that "this 
Jordanian-Palestinian family is one that is headed by His 
Majesty King Husayn and is always under his care." 
  Dr. al-'Anani, in telephone interview, said that 
"coordination has improved" between the Palestinian and 
Jordanian sides and that Thursday's meeting was "very good." 
  He denied that there was continued tension between the PLO 
and Jordan over coordination and said that the "Palestinians 
were fully aware of our position (regarding security issues) 
before they signed the agreement with Israel." 
  "I don't anticipate any problems with the PLO-Israel 
agreement because it appears to be borne out of our agreement 
with the PLO," Dr. al-'Anani said. 
  The PLO and Jordan concluded a draft security agreement in 
mid January which at the time was described by a PLO official as 
an accord that "would set the principles of future coordination 
on issues of borders, training and exchange of security 
information with the Jordanians.'" 
  Although the details of the January accord were not made 
public, a PLO security official was quoted as saying that it 
laid the basis for future security coordination and enhanced the 
PLO's negotiating position with the Israelis "by coordinating 
our own side's views." 
  On Wednesday, Mr. 'Arafat and Mr. Peres signed the 21-page 
document dealing with security issues and border crossing points 
in a ceremony hosted by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. Most 
of it was put together in marathon talks held both in Davos and 
Cairo. 
  Mr. 'Arafat gave King Husayn a copy of the agreement during 
Thursday's meeting and told reporters he "was enlightened by the 
King's views on the various issues we must face together. 
  He thanked the King for what he described as his "warm 
embrace of all our problems and issues." 
  "It is not strange for the King (to do that) when he already 
carries the worries of the Jordanian-Palestinian family," Mr. 
'Arafat told journalists before leaving for Tunis.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Jawad </F>
al-'Anani, in Amman, by Shadiyah Riyad, in Cairo, from the "The 
Talking Newspaper" program; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, what is Jordan's assessment 
of the Palestinian-Israeli achievement evident in the agreement 
signed by Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres in Cairo a few days ago? 
  [Al-'Anani] We hope that this agreement will be a step 
toward 
a comprehensive solution that will enable the Palestinian people 
to enjoy their full rights on their national soil and establish 
peace and future regional prosperity. Of course this step 
required much discussion and passed through many stages. I 
believe that the signing of the agreement in Cairo, with the 
backing of Egyptian foreign policy and political assistance at 
the highest Egyptian levels, constitutes an important step that 
gives us fresh hope that the peace negotiations will eventually 
produce practical results. Although some problems exist and some 
people take a different view of the matter, we see it as a good 
step and as a prelude to better future steps, God willing. 
  [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, as Your Excellency noted, these 
negotiations took a long time and some problems remain 
unresolved. However the major issues pertaining to the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles have been settled 
and solutions satisfactory to both sides have been found. 
Negotiations on other points and details will resume in Taba 
and Paris. Do you believe that the time factor is important at 
this stage? 
  [Al-'Anani] The time factor is certainly important because 
the people must be continuing to hope that the entire peace 
process is proceeding toward practical implementation. I 
believe that a long time has passed since the Madrid conference. 
Additionally, the Declaration of Principles of 13 September 
1993 specified a timetable for actual measures. The specified 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho should have taken place 
in December 1993. Delay produces frustration among the people 
and encourages the feeling that the peace process is slow and 
might lead nowhere. However, this recent and specific 
achievement bodes well, shows that matters are proceeding toward 
actual implementation, and that people will regain their lawful 
rights. 
  [Riyad] Do you believe that progress on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track will give impetus to the negotiations 
on the other tracks, particularly the Syrian track? 
  [Al-'Anani] In Jordan we always believe that progress on any 
track will eventually have a positive impact on the other 
tracks. In the short term, this might not appear true because 
the so-called Israeli public opinion does not appear able to 
cope with progress on more than one track at a time. This gives 
the impression that progress on one negotiating track might be 
at the expense of another. I believe, nevertheless, that any 
success must necessarily produce hope and reinforce the 
credibility of the negotiations on the other tracks. 
  [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, perhaps there is stagnation now on 
the 
Syrian track, contrary to what was expected immediately after 
the Clinton-al-Asad Geneva meeting. Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres is urging that the level of talks with Syria be 
raised. He believes it is necessary to hold a summit between 
Rabin and al-Asad. Do you think the time is propitious to hold 
such a summit? 
  [Al-'Anani] Of course we leave the answer to this question 
to 
our brothers in Syria. They know better. I believe they have 
given a reply to this Israeli proposal. Certainly it is not a 
question of raising or lowering the level of the talks. 
Everything has its own symbols and significance. We believe 
that the negotiations conducted by the Syrian and Israeli 
delegations for two years in Washington did not produce definite 
results. As a result of Israel's intransigence, the talks fell 
into a vicious circle. We believe it is time to get things 
moving. The heads of the delegations will hold consultative 
meetings starting next Tuesday [15 February]. If Rabinovich, the 
head of the Israeli delegation, is willing to make constructive 
proposals to Mr. al-'Allaf, the head of the Syrian delegation, 
and the Syrian leadership judges that these proposals need to be 
discussed at a higher level and that a possibility exists to 
make definite progress, then I believe that the Syrian 
leadership will decide to raise the level of negotiations. If 
things remain unchanged, however, I do not believe there will be 
sufficient reason to raise the level of negotiations. 
  [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, one last question. Do you expect 
progress on the Jordanian negotiating track at this stage? 
  [Al-'Anani] At this time? 
  [Riyad] Yes. 
  [Al-'Anani] According to the statements we heard from 
Israeli 
officials, it appears that, following the progress on the 
Palestinian front, they are focusing on the Syrian track. We in 
Jordan have no objections at all. We believe that progress on 
any Arab negotiating track is an achievement serving the 
objective of the comprehensive peaceful solution that we 
constantly advocate. It is still possible for progress to occur 
on the Jordanian track. Our position is perfectly clear. It is 
necessary to begin by solving the water and border issues. So 
far, the Israelis do not seem willing to discuss these issues 
with sufficient clarity. They might be somewhat flexible on the 
water issue, but we have seen no movement on their part in 
connection with the border issue. If they show a willingness to 
make progress on this point and expedite measures to return the 
occupied Jordanian territories, this will open the way to 
reasonable solutions on the other points on the 
Jordanian-Israeli agenda. 
  [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, thank you. 
  [Al-'Anani] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib from Amman from the "Panorama" </F>
program] 
  [Excerpt] Jordan's King Husayn has said that the killers of 
the Jordanian diplomat in Beirut, at the end of last month, 
belong to an extremist group that received orders from an Arab 
country. The king did not disclose the name of that country. 
An official Jordanian source, however, told our radio that the 
Arab country is Libya and that the group, which carried out the 
operation, is Fatah-the Revolutionary Council led by Abu-Nida.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Whirlpool of Agreements"] </F>
  [Text] When the Arab-Israeli negotiations began in 
Washington, it seemed to observers, and even to ordinary people, 
that the two negotiating sides were in a heated race to achieve 
peace. Many believed that attaining this objective was not a 
matter of years or months, but of a few weeks, and then 
everything would be settled. 
  The negotiations moved to Washington, then returned to the 
region. The nonpolitical negotiations continued to be held 
behind closed doors, making it impossible to know much about 
their results. However, what is leaked indicates that the 
experts are making great progress in all nonpolitical fields. 
This is a dangerous sign because it emphasizes that the 
Israelis want to get everything before even thinking about 
implementing the Security Council resolutions. 
  The agreement that was signed in Cairo last Wednesday, and 
the subsequent Israeli statements, are merely naive attempts to 
extract butter from water. Reading the texts of this agreement 
does not satisfy the Arab citizen, in general, and the 
Palestinian citizen, in particular, that an achievement was 
attained, but that the exact opposite was realized. 
  The Arab-Israeli negotiations are creeping slowly on their 
knees after their feet have become too tired to carry them. 
These negotiations are so slow that one can speak about many 
years before we see a real Israeli acceptance of Resolutions 242 
and 338. Therefore, the nonpolitical Arab-Israeli negotiations 
and the agreements reached in these talks on water and 
environment, narcotics and smuggling, and school and university 
syllabuses, radio and television programs, tourism, and many 
other issues, represent something very dangerous. We hope that 
the Arab negotiator will refuse to sign anything before 
something is achieved on the political and military tracks, 
which have become marathon roads full of thorns, nails, and 
banana skins.

  [Text] SHIHAN has learned that House of Representatives 
Speaker Tahir al-Masri has received a letter from Iranian Majles 
Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri. 
  SHIHAN has obtained the text of the letter, which urges the 
Jordanian House of Representatives to adopt appropriate measures 
to nullify the Gaza-Jericho agreement, dubbed by the letter as a 
disgraceful treaty. 
  The letter asserted that a practical approach to nullify the 
agreement is to emphasize armed jihad as the only and best way 
to face Zionist schemes and colonialism. 
  The letter explained Iran's view toward threats to the 
al-Aqsa Mosque in holy Jerusalem. The letter denounced the 
Islamic nations' silence toward the serious, false decisions 
made by what it termed the demonic Zionist movement against the 
al-Aqsa Mosque.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordan has not been officially informed of 
the Yemeni mediation committee's decision to sign the 
reconciliation agreement between former South and North Yemen in 
Amman of Feb. 20, official sources said Saturday [12 February]. 
  But Minister of Information Jawad al-'Anani said Jordan 
would 
welcome a decision to sign the accord in Amman "if our brothers 
in Yemen have decided so." 
  The sources said, however, that Jordan would not sponsor the 
signing of the reconciliation accord unless it is clear that the 
agreement would succeed in ending the conflict between Yemeni 
President 'Ali Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid. 
  News agencies Friday quoted the spokesman of the Yemeni 
dialogue committee, Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, as saying that the 
committee had agreed "with our Jordanian brethren" to have the 
accord signed in Amman on Feb. 20. 
  Agence France-Presse quoted a Yemeni official it did not 
name 
as saying that leaders of the three parties in the governing 
coalition would attend the signing ceremony to which Palestinian 
leader Yasir 'Arafat would be invited. 
  An official source did not specifically say whether Mr. 
'Arafat would attend the signing ceremony if it takes place in 
Amman. But this source said that Sultan Qabus of Oman, who 
mediated between the Yemeni parties, would be invited. 
  Diplomatic sources in Amman said that Yemeni parties are 
divided on which Arab leaders should be invited to the signing 
ceremony, adding that some prefer that only Yemeni officials 
attend it. 
  The sources refused to give any details about arrangements 
for signing the accord, which was reached on Jan. 18. 
  Sources said that some Arab parties are not happy with plans 
for having the reconciliation agreement signed in Jordan, which 
played a major role in mediation efforts between Mr. Salih and 
Mr. al-Bid. "This could be one major reason why the plans are 
not materialising as soon as we would like," one source said. 
  His Majesty King Husayn said last week that Jordan was very 
concerned with the situation in Yemen and "would do everything 
possible" to help solve the conflict, which threatended the 
merger of the formerly socialist South and conservative North. 
  The agreement was supposed to be signed in Amman early this 
month but the date was scuttled after new differences emerged 
between Mr. Salih and Mr. al-Bid. 
  The Yemeni crisis developed when Mr. al-Bid left the Yemeni 
capital Sanaa for South Yemen's capital Aden on Aug 19 where he 
remains until now. The crisis resulted from differences of 
opinion on the pace of the union as well as economic and social 
reform. 
  In elections held last April, Mr. Salih's General People's 
Congress (GPC) and Mr. al-Bid's Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) 
emerged as the two dominant parties and agreed to form a 
coalition government headed by Mr. Salih as president and Mr. 
al-Bid as vice- president. The Islamic al-Islah [Islamic 
Reform] party was later invited to the coalition. 
  But political differences emerged thereafter, with Mr. 
al-Bid 
accusing Mr. Salih and his GPC of trying to dominate the country 
and running an elimination campaign against southern leaders. 
  The reconciliation accord drawn up last week envisages 
political and economic reforms demanded by Mr. al-Bid and 
accepted by Mr. Salih.

  [Text] A senior White House source has asserted that the 
U.S. Administration is seriously considering providing economic 
and military aid to Jordan in recognition of its distinguished 
role and importance in the region. 
  In reply to a question by a correspondent for the JORDANIAN 
NEWS AGENCY in Washington, the responsible U.S. source, which 
requested anonymity, said His Majesty King Husayn's recent visit 
to the United States and his talks with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton were successful. The discussions addressed ways to 
promote bilateral cooperation. 
  Addressing reporters from 17 countries -- who are visiting 
the United States at the private invitation of the U.S. 
Information Agency -- the source said President Clinton's 
administration greatly appreciates Jordan's stands, its genuine 
desire for peace, and its efforts to achieve it in accordance 
with UN resolutions. 
  The source added that Jordanian-U.S. contacts are 
continuing, 
pointing out that so far no specific decision has been made on 
the size and nature of U.S. aid to Jordan. 
  The source said the decision of the U.S. Administration and 
its allies to give a warning to the Bosnian Serbs was in line 
with the desire of the U.S. public to end the siege on Bosnian 
Muslims in Sarajevo and the need to end the war in the Balkans.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Blocs Versus States"] </F>
  [Text] The Egyptian Parliament's decision on Monday [7 
February] to abrogate Egypt's status as a signatory to the 
agreement that created the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC) in 
January 1989 is regrettable to say the least. Needless to say, 
the move means Egypt's withdrawal from the economic and 
political alliance with Jordan, Yemen and Iraq. It is true that 
the council, formed at the height of political coordination and 
cooperation among the four member states, went into limbo after 
the August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and reviving it now 
does not look an easy task, given the state of isolation Iraq is 
finding itself in. 
  But it is equally tragic that one of its members found it 
fit 
to quit the alliance for whatever reason at a time when the 
shifting regional and international patterns underline the 
importance of regional blocs in the developing world to get a 
better deal from the developed world. 
  Launched as an ambitious grouping to gain the benefit from a 
collective impact of the material and human resources of the 
four countries while dealing with the outside world, the ACC got 
off to a good start and was holding out promises of fruits of 
sincere cooperation and coordination when the Gulf crisis struck 
it down. Going into apportioning blame for the tragedy that 
befell the Arab world is a futile, academic exercise and will 
not serve any useful purpose and will only open old wounds. 
  But, in a wider perspective, the Egyptian decision to quit 
the ACC raises another serious and grave question: Does it mean 
that Cairo has given up hopes that Iraq would be rehabilitated 
into mainstream Arab and international politics? 
  The reality that cannot be waived aside with any gesture, 
political or economic, is that Iraq and its 18 million people 
are a part and parcel of the Arab Nation. Indeed, Jordan's 
concern had always been and remains to be an anxiety to 
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people. Regardless of 
whatever anybody had said or has or will say about it, the 
Jordanian stand remains firm that Arab and international efforts 
should seek to help the people of Iraq to survive the national 
catastrophe that has befallen them and eventually their country 
should reassume the rightful role it has always played in Arab 
politics and economics. The process might take some time, but 
the wounds have to be healed and Iraq has to be and will be 
brought back into the regional and international mainstream. 
And when that happens, we, the countries of the region, Jordan, 
Egypt, Yemen and others included, would still be facing the same 
equation: Blocs vs. states in a world of cutthroat economic 
policies and markets against which we have to defend ourselves 
and protect our interests, something better served if done 
collectively.

<F P=106> [Report by David Ze'ev] </F>
  [Text] The Israeli coordinator of activities in the 
territories, Major General Dani Rothschild, told the cabinet 
today there is indifference among Palestinians over the peace 
process. They want to see how they will benefit amid economic 
problems in the Gaza Strip that include high unemployment. A 
senior government source says Gen. Rothschild spoke of internal 
strife within Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah organization -- those loyal 
to the peace process at odds with those who continue to hoard 
arms. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says the PLO negotiators 
holding talks with Israel on the Gaza-Jericho First plan are 
personally threatened. They do not have much room to maneuver 
in making decisions. A senior diplomatic source adds that 
Palestinian delegates have received death threats. And Minister 
Yosi Sarid, a member of the Peres team that signed the Cairo 
security agreement with the PLO last week, said Israel must take 
into account the duress of the Palestinian negotiators. 
  Taking into account the recent spate of Palestinian attacks 
on Israelis, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said the question of 
whether to tighten the closure imposed on the territories last 
year is to be considered. The police are calling for steps that 
include limiting the number of Palestinian vehicles allowed to 
enter Israel from the territories and, once again, raising the 
minimum age of Palestinians permitted to cross over. Army chief 
of staff, Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, told the cabinet the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has not yet come to the conclusion 
that the closure should be tightened, or that a complete closure 
should be imposed. But, he said, the Army is ready to 
reconsider whether such steps should be taken. 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Network Channel 1 in Hebrew at 
1800 GMT on 13 February, in a report by political correspondent 
Gadi Sukenik, carries a recording of Minister Shim'on Shetrit's 
remarks to reporters after the 13 February cabinet meeting: 
"When we discuss the permanent arrangement, we will insist that 
no separate, independent Palestinian state is to be established." 
  [Sukenik adds that "Minister Peres' remarks on the need for 
Israelis to discuss the evacuation of the Netzarim and Dugit 
settlements despite the agreement which leaves them in place, 
caused a controversy in the government."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin "granted </F>
jointly to both Israeli television channels" by political 
reporter 'Imanu'el Rosen and Channel 1 party affairs reporter 
Shlomo Raz in Jerusalem on 10 February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Rosen] Sir, you have often 
complained recently about 'Arafat. You said he should sweat it 
out in Tunis. And yet in the end, he accepted practically every 
demand Israel posed in the sphere of security. Has 'Arafat 
changed in any way? 
  [Rabin] I am not saying he accepted every demand; we too 
compromised here and there. I thought there were basic things 
on which we had to insist, and I am happy that the sides drew 
closer to each other on that. I do not want the outcome to be 
presented as if he alone did all the conceding; we did some too. 
  [Rosen] What concessions did we make? 
  [Rabin] We ceded on several issues pertaining to the border 
crossings; several issues pertaining to the right to hold Muslim 
religious rituals in al-Nabi Musa, for instance; to permit the 
holding of baptism rituals in the Jordan River three times a 
year, and in special cases that have to be coordinated with us; 
even with a flag. 
  [Raz] Yet last night, before the agreement was signed, you 
and the military advisers who surrounded you seemed to be 
wavering, unsure that the agreement should be signed. 
  [Rabin] Not at all wavering or unsure, rather anxious to do 
everything to ensure our vital security issues. 
  Allow me to add something: I have been hearing criticism of 
the Army involvement. I am simply unable to understand both 
politicians and media people. I remember when I once said I did 
not involve the Army in the months-long negotiations -- the 
secret Oslo negotiations which gave us the Declaration of 
Principles [DOP] -- there was an outcry of criticism: How can 
you keep the Army out of it? That was a matter of principle, a 
political decision. Now, when the implementation of that 
agreement is at stake, the implementation of security issues, I 
see it as my pragmatic As#?V????l duty to involve the Army. 
  [Rosen] Someone wrote about a putsch this week. 
  [Rabin] Right. I have never heard baloney worse than that. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Raz] I assume a meeting between you and 'Arafat should not 
be expected in the near future. 
  [Rabin] I see no reason to attend such a meeting before 
everything is finalized. 
  [Rosen] I assume this will not happen before 13 April. 
  [Rabin] There are no sacred dates. Even the DOP stipulates 
that the dates are based on the assumption that agreements will 
be attained. From my point of view, what matters is attaining 
an agreement that, with all this complexity, stands a chance to 
succeed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
correspondent Mahir Shalabi in Jerusalem from the Face-to-Face 
program, in English with superimposed Arabic translation; date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Shalabi] Mr. Prime Minister, the 
Clinton-al-Asad summit has given an impetus to the peace 
opportunities between Syria and Israel. After the summit, you 
declared that the withdrawals from the Golan would be subjected 
to a public referendum. Are you not erecting obstacles to the 
chances for peace with Syria? 
  [Rabin] No, I don't think so, because I believe that the 
people of Israel are interested in achieving peace with the 
Palestinians in the way that we have been pursuing since the 
signing of the Declaration of Principles in Washington, and with 
Syria because of its strategic importance and its influence in 
what is going on in Lebanon, and in a more limited way with 
Jordan. 
  Furthermore, I believe that the Syrian leadership and people 
need peace. But this is not enough for Israel. The Syrian 
leadership is responsible for convincing the Israeli Government 
and people that Syria indeed means peace. I don't expect the 
Syrian leadership to do the same thing that President al-Sadat 
did to convince the Israeli people that he wanted peace. No 
doubt -- in my opinion -- Al-Sadat's presence in Jerusalem 
accomplished 80 or 90 percent of the work of former Israeli 
prime minister Menahem Begin in convincing the Israeli people 
that Egypt wanted peace. This made it easy for the Israeli 
Government to pay a high price for peace. 
  We are involved in negotiations with Syria but they are not 
being held in the same way that we had our negotiations with 
Egypt. But at the same time, Syria is not making much of an 
effort to reduce the terrorist activities of Hizballah against 
Israel. Therefore, the issue is very important to the people of 
Israel. I believe that there is democratic life in Israel and 
that on certain issues the opinions of the people must be taken 
into account. I did not do that when I signed the Declaration 
of Principles document with the PLO. I do not intend to do that 
when the Declaration of Principles Accord is implemented with 
regard to the Gaza-Jericho First and then regarding the 
subsequent stage. As for Syria, the issue is much more 
important. 
  [Shalabi] How do you expect the Syrian side to carry out 
confidence-building steps when at the same time you are accusing 
the Syrians of supporting Hizballah? 
  [Rabin] I believe that in July, the Lebanese Government was 
prepared to deploy 3,000 Lebanese troops in south Lebanon, north 
of the security zone, alongside the South Lebanese Army, to 
prove that they could prevent terrorism. If, after six month of 
deployment, the Lebanese Army an prove it is capable of 
preventing terrorist activities and disarming Hizballah, I am 
prepared to sign a peace treaty based on the international 
borders that existed during the British mandate. This treaty 
would produce security arrangements and would confirm to the 
Lebanese who cooperate with us in the security zone that they 
will not be harmed and that no actions will be taken against 
them beyond those taken against the other militias, which were 
disarmed by the Lebanese Government over the past one and a half 
years. Therefore, there is no reason not to have peace with 
Lebanon. 
  [Shalabi] Mr. Prime Minister, the recent incidents in 
Lebanon have led to calls by the Israeli right to launch a 
large-scale attack against the Hizballah. What is your opinion 
on this? 
  [Rabin] I do not want to specify what kind of military 
operations we will conduct in the future. I think that the 
method and policy I pursued when I served as defense minister in 
the National Unity Government in 1985 are the same today. A new 
war in Lebanon will lead to nowhere. At the same time, we will 
maintain freedom of military activities whenever and wherever we 
find it necessary against Hizballah targets all over Lebanon. 
  [Shalabi] So, do you expect the situation to remain the same 
in southern Lebanon until a settlement is reached with Syria? 
  [Rabin] I believe that a solution to the problem between 
Lebanon and Israel is a peace agreement when the Lebanese 
Government, with the support of Syria, is able to prove that it 
is in full in control of all Lebanese sovereign areas. As I 
said before, let the test be six months from the time the 
Lebanese forces have deployed and have taken action against 
Hizballah and show that they are capable of doing that. Once 
they have proven that, you know that there is no territorial 
problem between Israel and Lebanon. We do not want an inch of 
the sovereign soil of Lebanon. We do not want one cubic meter of 
it. All what we want is peace and security, and to give the 
option to the Lebanese Government to prove its ability to 
control its sovereign soil and prevent the use of its territory 
as a springboard for attacks against Israel. [passage omitted] 
  [Shalabi] There are reports of a decision to release about 
2,000 Palestinian detainees. Is this true? 
  [Rabin] No. We made it clear that the release of the 
prisoners and the detainees, particularly the detainees, will 
take place together with the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
First agreement, after they are separated in groups. There are 
groups of Palestinian prisoners who have killed Israelis, and I 
do not think that they will be released. Furthermore, we have 
our own demands to make of the Palestinians. For example, we 
have three soldiers who have been missing since the June 1982 
war who were killed [as heard] in a clash with a Palestinian 
force under Syrian command. We expect the PLO to indicate their 
whereabouts and whether they are alive or not. We need 
cooperation on the part of the Palestinians. The demand cannot 
be one-sided. We want a responsible position from the 
Palestinian side regarding the missing. 
  [Shalabi] Regarding this particular point, there are reports 
about hundreds of Palestinians missing since 1967 who are being 
held in Israeli prisons. Is there any truth in that? 
  [Rabin] We cannot keep anyone in any Israeli prison without 
announcing it; our laws demand this. Anyone who violates these 
laws will be brought to trial. 
  [Shalabi] Mr. Prime Minister, after the Madrid conference, 
everybody has been talking about a new Middle East. How do you 
see it from your standpoint? 
  [Rabin] I hope that once we reach an agreement with the 
three neighboring states--Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon--in 
addition to the peace with Egypt--the 15th anniversary of which 
we are celebrating these days--and the start of the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles with the 
Palestinians, there will be a better chance to check the 
activities of the extremist Islamic groups that are threatening 
the moderate regimes in the Arab world. This will lead to a new 
Middle East and a better climate for cooperation among the 
countries and peoples of the area for the benefit and progress 
of all the peoples and the countries of this area. 
  [Shalabi] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that following 
the news of the two attacks, the Islamic Jihad is the leading 
terror organization operating in the territories. Rabin spoke 
at Labor Party headquarters last night. Dani Gur-Arye reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Prime Minister Rabin says the 
attacks on Israelis are painful. He says they highlight the 
need to begin implementation of the agreement with the 
Palestinians. Speaking to the Labor Party Bureau in Tel Aviv, 
Rabin said Israel must fight hard against those who seek to 
derail the peace process. He said Israel is determined to see 
the agreement through despite the violence. Police Minister 
Moshe Shahal said following the Bureau meeting that the new 
security arrangement with the Palestinians will make such 
attacks more difficult for those who oppose the peace process. 
  [Shahal] We expect that the Palestinians will prevent any 
kind of terror acts or violence of any kind against Israeli 
civilians. For that matter, we are going to have all of the 
responsibility on their shoulders and this is their obligation. 
We are realistic enough to know that there are those who oppose 
the peace process and probably they will try to sabotage the 
peace process by terror acts against civilians: Israelis and 
maybe even Palestinians. But the Palestinian authority in Gaza 
and Jericho will be responsible to prevent those actions. 
  [Gur-Arye] Prime Minister Rabin said at the Bureau meeting 
that the Islamic Jihad is the leading terror organization in the 
territories. He said it would take at least a month to reach 
agreement on outstanding issues with the Palestinians. He ruled 
out meeting with Yasir 'Arafat before all the issues are 
resolved. Rabin said Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres had 
coordinated all his moves with him on the phone from Cairo. He 
criticized Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin for promising 
that the government would resign if the public rejects an 
agreement with Syria in a national referendum. Prime Minister 
Rabin said Beilin had no authority to make such a promise. [end 
recording] 
  [Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 11 February in a 
page 1 report on the Labor Party Bureau meeting by Sarah Honig 
adds that Prime Minister Rabin adds: "Arab terrorism will not be 
controlled without help from the Palestinian police." THE 
JERUSALEM POST writes that "Rabin noted that Israel could not 
eradicate terror when it controlled the territories. 'Perhaps 
what we need is a partner to help us towards that end. When the 
Palestinians have self-rule and deploy their own police force, 
they will have their own interest in putting an end to terrorist 
acts perpetrated by their own people. 
  ["`They will have something to lose if they do not exert 
control. They will have an enormous stake in securing the 
peace. If they fail and the bloodletting continue, they know 
they will not arrive at their destination and will not get what 
they wish to achieve beyond Gaza and Jericho,' Rabin said."]

Palestinian state will emerge in the territories at the end of 
the peace process and the Golan Heights will be returned to 
Syria. Zvili adds that Israel has a framework agreement signed 
with King Husayn, and when it is publicized, people will find 
the security arrangements achieved for the border crossings 
surprising. Nisim Zvili spoke before Hashomer Hatza'ir [youth 
movement affiliated with MAPAM, the United Workers Party, a 
Meretz component] council at Ma'ale Habesor in the western Negev 
yesterday. 
  Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that Hashomer 
Hatza'ir leaders decided to convene their council near the Gaza 
Strip border in order to emphasize the main topic of their 
discussion: a call on the Palestinian youth to establish a 
peace camp and to struggle against the extremists.

  [Excerpts] Labor Party Secretary General Nisim Zvili says 
at the end of the peace process a Palestinian state will be 
established in the territories and the Golan will be returned to 
Syria. [passage omitted] 
  The Tzomet faction is demanding that the prime minister make 
it clear whether Zvili's remarks were made with Rabin's 
knowledge. Tzomet said Rabin had made a commitment that a 
Palestinian state would not be established, and that not all of 
the Golan would be handed back. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan 
said that if Zvili's remarks were correct, then the State of 
Israel's days were numbered, and the countdown had started. 
  Likud Bureau chairman, Knesset Member 'Uzi Landau, said 
after 
two years of misleading the public and deception, Nisim Zvili 
had finally spoken the truth on the prime minister's secret 
intentions. The Likud demanded that Rabin immediately submit to 
the Knesset the agreements formulated with Jordan and the draft 
accords with the Syrians. 
  The head of the Golan settlements committee, Eli Malka, said 
Zvili's remarks were a scandal and deceive the public. If the 
Labor Party had decided to hand over the Golan, what was the 
purpose of negotiations? And, if that was the Labor Party's 
position, he demanded an immediate referendum. 
  On another matter, Absorption Minister Ya'ir Tzaban told the 
Hashomer Hatza'ir council that residents of Netzarim in the Gaza 
Strip are making it difficult for the Army to carry out its 
duties, and their behavior requires a sharp reaction. The 
residents are demanding security for places that should never 
have been set up, but refuse to rent empty buildings. 
  Foreign Minister Peres said one should ask out loud what is 
the point of keeping Netzarim where there are only 28 families 
and a company of soldiers had to defend them. The chairman of 
Netzarim's secretariat, Shlomo Kostina, said Peres' remarks 
disclosed his intentions regarding settlement in the Golan, the 
Jordan Valley, and Judaea and Samaria. He invited Peres to 
visit Netzarim now and in 10 years time.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said that although 
terror hurts, we must once and for all solve the conflict. The 
weapon of terror is in the hands of those who oppose us. Today, 
we are in control of the territories, yet we are unable to foil 
terrorism. If our partner realizes that security is important 
to us, and if he understands that he will not attain his goals 
as long as there is no full security, he will have an interest 
in seeing to it that security is realized. 
  Mr. Rabin further said that he recognizes the existence of a 
Palestinian entity, but distinguishes between it and a state. 
The Palestinians will have their flag and other symbols, such 
as a police force. They are entitled to have symbols, Rabin 
told the Labor Party Bureau in Tel Aviv today.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said he was astonished 
at the remarks of Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili, and said 
the two issues Zvili mentioned -- a Palestinian state and the 
future of the Golan -- contradict the resolutions of the Labor 
Party convention and certainly do not reflect its positions. 
  This evening, Zvili denied having said that he is in favor 
of 
a Palestinian state. He nevertheless added that he foresees the 
emergence of a Palestinian state at the end of a long process, 
although this is a bad solution and Labor opposes it. Zvili 
added that he foresees Israel ultimately recognizing Syria's 
sovereignty over the Golan. Referring to an agreement with 
Jordan, he said that although it has been finalized he does not 
expect the Jordanian monarch to publicize it any time soon.

<F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Jordan's King 
Husayn conferred secretly shortly after the signing of the Oslo 
agreement, either in the 'Arava or the Gulf of Elat. 
  Diplomatic sources told our correspondent that Rabin decided 
to reassure King Husayn, in whom he found signs of panic, 
following the signing of the Oslo agreements. In the wake of 
that meeting, Israel began to report regularly to Jordan about 
the talks with the Palestinians and the two coordinated 
positions prior to each meeting Israel held with the PLO. 
  The two leaders discussed the procedures for crossings at 
the 
King 'Abdallah Bridge, which the two states are due to begin 
rebuilding soon. The bridge will link Amman directly with East 
Jerusalem while bypassing Jericho. Our correspondent notes that 
there has been a change in the wording of the 
Israeli-Palestinian security coordinating committee from what 
was decided in Davos. While in Davos the committee was called 
"The Committee for Israeli-Palestinian Security," in Cairo the 
term Israeli-Palestinian was dropped, apparently in order to 
leave an opening for Jordan to join security coordinating 
committee in the future. 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat yesterday arrived in Amman and 
reported to King Husayn on the Cairo talks after Husayn twice 
voiced open criticism of the Palestinian-Jordanian Coordinating 
Committee on Security Affairs.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was asked a few 
minutes ago to comment on his proposal to Syria to engage in 
talks on more than one track and on the Syrian rejection of this 
proposal. Peres said there is no indication that Syria has 
softened its demands from Israel. Peres seems quite pessimistic 
concerning the prospects of advancing the negotiations with 
Syria. He said their acceptance of his suggestion to expand the 
Syrian-Israeli negotiations to several tracks would have 
indicated that they seriously meant to promote the peace 
process. For Peres, their rejection of his proposal was another 
unfavorable sign of Syria's intentions. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 13 February 
cites Peres as saying that "Israel prefers a confederation 
between the Palestinian entity and Jordan. If such a 
confederation is not established, conflicts may arise between 
Jordan and the Palestinian entity, entangling Israel."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F>
correspondent Shlomo Raz on 11 February; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Raz] Mr. Foreign Minister, you concluded security 
issues in Cairo which should lead to more security and calm, yet 
this past week we witnessed two more murders, a renewed wave of 
terror. 
  [Peres] One must not forget, the negotiations as well as the 
agreement are still only on paper, they are not reality. The 
Palestinians do not have a police force, nor responsibility. 
Responsibility is still 100 percent ours. Therefore, they 
cannot be expected to do what they cannot. Things will 
hopefully change in the future, but we will have to go through a 
difficult period still. 'Arafat told me he clearly understands 
that if anything happens in Gaza -- God forbid -- all fingers, 
the Israelis, the Europeans, and the Americans, will be pointed 
at him. He said he surely understands that establishing peace 
is in their supreme interest. 
  [Raz] Still, the last two murders took place inside Israel. 
  [Peres] Yes, but we know who perpetrated them. Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] -- not the PLO -- did this. 
Murder occurs in Arab countries too; fundamentalists exist 
there too. I believe that when the agreement is translated into 
reality, we will feel the change on the ground. 
  [Raz] When will the agreement turn into reality indeed? The 
talks in Taba and Paris are slated to resume next week, I 
understand, and this is another stage on the way toward 
implementation. 
  [Peres] Numerically speaking, we overcame only some of the 
problems. Qualitatively, we surmounted most of the difficult 
problems, although we are facing additional difficult problems 
still. I must tell you though, that there were moments during 
these talks that I doubted we would overcome. The gaps are so 
big. I am referring to gaps in formulation, in views, and even 
more so, in feelings. 
  [Raz] How did you manage to overcome problems then? Who 
gave or caved in? 
  [Peres] This is not a matter of caving in. It is not a 
give- and-take type of negotiation. You know, many ask me what 
we received. From Israel's viewpoint, we first and foremost 
negotiate with ourselves rather than with the Palestinians. The 
Likud acted wisely: It conducted negotiations with itself; it 
did not give up anything. The disadvantage is that this cannot 
lead to any results; rather, this can result in greater enmity 
and hatred, greater danger and number of casualties involved. 
Where does this unforgettable genius lead? 
  [Raz] Still, what are the weaknesses in the agreement you 
worked out in Cairo? 
  [Peres] You know, we initially said we would give the 
Palestinians honor and they would give us security, or rather, 
agree on security issues, but the truth is that what we call 
security they call honor, and what they term honor we think of 
as security. For example, will the Palestinian policemen 
stationed in the border terminal be armed with pistols or not? 
Can you conceive of a policeman without a pistol? A policeman 
needs weapons for self- defense in case an armed person enters 
or in case somebody runs wild. This is a simple example of a 
problem that caused hardship. 
  [Raz] They will have pistols after all, I believe. 
  [Peres] Yes. Reference is to up to 10 policemen. 
  [Raz] So, is it because of 10 armed policemen that the 
defense establishment had so many reservations, according to 
several reports? 
  [Peres] Do not lead me into this kind of false drama. There 
is a military echelon which should give military advice. This 
is its duty and I have no complaints about this. Just as 
doctors give medical counseling, the Army counsels on security 
issues and should insist on this, and so should the politicians, 
for their part, insist on what is politically necessary. I have 
no complaints about this. 
  Doubts arise though. The whole issue of crossing the 
border terminal for instance. They say we are giving them 
autonomy rather than independence, but when a Jericho resident 
arrives at the terminal, what does autonomy mean to him? -- Let 
him be welcomed by a Palestinian policeman with a Palestinian 
flag. We said no, we want to check everyone who goes through. 
You can ask why there is an argument over a policeman. The 
argument is not over a policeman but over a sea of feelings, of 
anxieties, suspicions, and hopes, and with correct phrasing you 
can sometimes surmount problems. 
  [Raz] Who guarantees, Mr. Peres, that these formulations 
will pass the test of reality? Your experience shows that 
'Arafat went back on agreements at the very last minute? 
  [Peres] Who can guarantee there will be no war, or anything 
else for that matter? Gambling or risks is the name of the game 
wherever you turn. You may bring about war, but then you may 
also bring about peace. There are no absolute guarantees, 
rather absolute choices. If you ask me, the Palestinians are 
dead tired of the current situation. I noticed the great 
distress, the numerous internal struggles they have constantly 
experienced regarding the negotiations. They too are facing an 
opposition. The difference is that ours is usually expressed in 
no-confidence motions, while theirs is manifest in shooting to 
kill. A death threat is hovering over almost every person who 
sat to the negotiations table with us. 
  [Raz] What request or demand by the Palestinians we could 
not accept? 
  [Peres] For instance, a demand that we shoulder joint rather 
than full responsibility for the border, the terminals, and the 
roads which connect the settlements to Israel. They told us: 
Do you think we do not want to fight murderers? Our answer 
was: Although it is true that we cannot guarantee the safety of 
our people 100 percent even when we are fully in charge of 
security, still, when something happens God forbid, nobody would 
doubt that we made our best efforts to prevent this. We told 
them: Imagine that we share responsibility, that you and we, 
each share 50 percent responsibility, and a fatal incident 
occurs, everyone will then say it is because of you that we do 
not have full security. 
  As for the three roads, the Palestinians told us: Is it for 
a single settlement, with 28 families, that you want to control 
a 5-km long road, to have the right to absolute responsibility 
over this road and the areas alongside it? 
  [Raz] You are referring to the settlement of Netzarim, I 
understand. 
  [Peres] I am talking of two roads which branch off from the 
Qatif Bloc, one southward, south-east, and the other northward, 
north-east, as well as a road to Netzarim. The Palestinians 
say: We have villages and traffic too, after all, while you want 
5 km for 28 families; you have to be logical too as to what you 
are doing. I am giving the other side's contention. You know, 
sitting at home and negotiating with yourself is very simple, 
but here you sit opposite the other side and want to reach an 
agreement with it rather than to imposing an agreement. There 
were moments when they simply said they could not go back to 
their people with what was raised. Well, if it is impossible, 
it is impossible. 
  [Raz] This may be a hypothetical question, but would you 
support the evacuation of any settlements in the Gaza Strip? 
  [Peres] Not under the pressure of negotiations. I believe 
the Likud established a terrible precedent with regard to the 
Sinai. Those who criticize us about the settlements today are 
those who forcefully evacuated the settlers from the Sinai at 
the time! To tell you the truth, I have questions which should 
be asked out loud indeed: What is the sense in keeping a 
settlement of 28 families that need laborers from Thailand, that 
need a military company to defend them, and whose road should 
always be protected? Where are the bounds of logic here? Have 
we not effected cuts in the Israel Aircraft Industries and 
REFA'EL [Armament Development Authority]? Are these not cuts in 
the defense sphere? We went to maximum extremes here from the 
economic and security viewpoints. I heard one of the 
settlements' residents say that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
would not have stayed in the area had it not been for them. 
Well, what does the Army need to do there? The moment we 
decided the IDF will not be Gaza's policeman, then.... 
  [Raz, interrupting] I would like to go beyond the 
Palestinian issue. How does this agreement you consolidated in 
Cairo influence other tracks of the negotiations, the talks with 
Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon? 
  [Peres] First, this agreement surely impressed the world. 
Why? This was because we overcame very complex problems, 
involving historic, mental, and territorial disagreements, 
without guns firing, without war threats, without planes. As 
for the Syrians, if they do not expand the negotiation, if they 
maintain them on a narrow path, we will face only difficulties, 
I believe. We have a very talented representative, our 
ambassador in Washington, Itamar Rabinovich, who knows the 
subject matter and how to conduct negotiations. He is a very 
serious, able person, but he will not be able to make progress 
on this narrow path. 
  [Raz] Are you alluding to the necessity of having a summit 
meeting with al-Asad? 
  [Peres] Yes, but in general, the negotiations should be 
expanded. In my opinion, it is desirable to have a meeting 
between al-Asad and Rabin, and the negotiations should then move 
into the political plane. Look how matters proceeded with 
Egypt. The negotiations cannot remain so controlled and 
restricted to such a narrow channel. [laughingly] We need a 
second channel [referring to New Israel Television Channel 2] 
  [Raz] How about Jordan? 
  [Peres] As for Jordan, the Jordanians have taken steps. The 
king's statement is important, in my opinion. I think that he 
admitted that there were secret meetings first. In other words, 
he paved the road for open meetings in the future. He said.... 
  [Raz, interrupting] Is a date emerging for an open meeting 
already? 
  [Peres] Not yet, not yet. The point about the Jordanians is 
that they are saying the correct things now. We did succeed in 
one thing: We stopped the secrecy. I told the Jordanians: Is 
peace an underground matter? Why are you complaining about 
leaks on our side? We dislike that you want to conceal this in 
the first place? What do you mean by this? So now, the 
Jordanians came out with matters openly. I am also happy that 
the king spoke of the economic issue. Incidentally, 'Arafat too 
began to discuss economics with me. I think he even quoted from 
a book I wrote, but then he may have wanted to please me, who 
knows? 
  [Raz] There is another question I must ask you. Do you too 
think that the government will have to resign if a referendum is 
held and the government does not win a majority? 
  [Peres] I think it will win a majority. I cannot conceive 
of anything else. If we succeed in the negotiations, the 
majority will support us. If we fail, we will need to be thrown 
out anyway. A government is elected every four years rather 
than four days since a government which cannot be unpopular does 
not deserve to rule. The four years are granted so that the 
government can also adopt unpopular measures in order to achieve 
popular goals, for otherwise, nothing will be gained. 
  [Raz] Mr. Foreign Minister, thank you very much. 
  [Peres] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq </F>
by Dan Scemama "this afternoon in the television studios" -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Scemama] We open the interview with the chief 
of staff with a question about the realities of the last 24 
hours. Since the signing of the agreement in Cairo, Naftali 
Sahar and Ilan Sudri have been murdered by terrorists. 
  [Baraq] We must look reality in the eye. In view of the 
fact that thousands of Palestinians have employee-employer, 
buyer-seller, or service supplier-receiver relationships within 
the boundaries of Israel, no police force, security service, or 
army can technically prevent the physical ability to raise a 
knife. We will do our best to have good control, and I am sure 
that the Israel Police and the Shin Bet will do their utmost. 
Ultimately, nevertheless, some of the responsibility lies with 
the Israeli people. 
  Today, we are still responsible for providing a livelihood 
and jobs to the inhabitants of Gaza. That is why we must allow 
them to enter Israel. I hope not to get into a situation where 
in the wake of similar incidents we are forced to close off 
Gaza. Conditions will change once an agreement is reached. In 
my opinion, if workers from Gaza murder Israelis within the 
boundaries of Israel, they may very well not be allowed to come 
in. 
  [Scemama] Are you saying that this could be a sanction? 
Will we simply bar workers from entering Israel? 
  [Baraq] I am stating my opinion. At the moment, we as a 
state are responsible for them and we must provide them jobs. 
If and when an agreement is reached and they become the 
responsibility of the Palestinian authority -- if some of them 
take advantage of the right to work in Israel to murder their 
employers or the right to travel by taxi to murder its driver -- 
it is my assessment that this could lead us to the conclusion 
that such a situation can no longer go on. In my opinion, the 
very realization that such a possibility exists will make them 
have second thoughts and, perhaps, reduce such incidents. 
Otherwise, we will have to make some decisions. 
  [Scemama] How about Israelis who live in settlements in Gaza 
or Israelis driving in the Gaza Strip? Does this agreement 
satisfy you? In your view, can this agreement provide security 
for Israelis traveling on the roads or living in the Gaza Strip? 
  [Baraq] A great deal was achieved in the agreement. On the 
other hand, many points remain to be worked out -- and I suppose 
will be worked out within the next few weeks in Taba and in 
Cairo -- before we can sign the final agreement for 
implementation. A great deal was achieved in that the 
settlements are recognized as one bloc surrounded by a security 
circle rather than individually. The agreement recognizes our 
responsibility for Israeli traffic on the roads, including the 
right to carry out independent Israeli action on the roads and 
in their immediate proximity. And, of course, it recognizes our 
responsibility for external security. These three points, which 
were recognized in principle by the Palestinians, must now be 
translated into particulars for implementation. 
  [Scemama] Sir, today there are undercover units, Shin Bet, 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces], and Border Police troops in the 
midst of Arab population centers. What will prevent an Arab 
terrorist from setting out from Khan Yunus, approaching a 
settlement fence, opening fire, and hurting people, then fleeing 
back to this Arab town? 
  [Baraq] Within a radius of several hundred meters from a 
settlement -- that is, within a distance from which he can 
effectively open fire at the settlement -- he will come up 
against the IDF which will be in charge of security. Outside 
this radius, in the area controlled by the Palestinians, we 
expect the Palestinian police force to act effectively long 
before terror attacks and long after terror attacks where the 
perpetrators are not killed or wounded in the course of the 
attack. 
  [Scemama] Can we place our confidence in such a future 
Palestinian police force? 
  [Baraq] The agreement we are working on is largely based on 
a strong and effective Palestinian police force which would 
cooperate with us. If they fail this test, we will have to 
reach conclusions about the agreement itself and about extending 
it to the rest of Judaea and Samaria later on. I think they 
will have a strong incentive to meet these conditions but, if 
they do not, we will have to reach some conclusions. 
  [Scemama] Sir, in the course of the political negotiations, 
did you propose to evacuate certain settlements, such as 
Netzarim, from the Qatif Bloc, in order to overcome some 
security problem? 
  [Baraq] We did not make such a proposal and we are not even 
supposed to adopt a position on any of the issues that were 
decided on by the government. The government made a decision, 
which it put into writing and signed in the DOP [Declaration of 
Principles], to the effect that no settlement will be relocated 
at this stage. That is why no settlement, including Netzarim 
with its 27 or 28 families, is being relocated.... 
  [Scemama, interrupting] There have been reports about such a 
recommendation by military elements. 
  [Baraq, continuing] ....Or smaller locations. We are not 
evacuating any place and there certainly was not and could not 
be such a recommendation by the military. 
  [Scemama] Do you estimate that the IDF will evacuate Gaza 
and Jericho by 13 April? When will the withdrawal actually 
start now that the agreement has been signed? 
  [Baraq] This is not the agreement which had originally been 
scheduled to be signed on 13 December. This agreement 
elaborates in greater detail on the issues I mentioned earlier 
and passes the torch to the working teams which will now have to 
sit for weeks -- maybe three or six week, I do not know exactly; 
it depends on the responsiveness of the other side -- and work 
out a detailed agreement for implementation. Only when we get 
such an agreement will we be able to assess when its 
implementation will be completed. 
  [Scemama] How long will it take to withdraw from these areas 
the moment such an agreement is concluded? 
  [Baraq] In my opinion, the moment an agreement is concluded 
a withdrawal can be completed within six weeks or perhaps two 
months. The DOP originally talks about four months from the 
signing of the agreement. In practice, we do not need so much 
time. However, we have not yet signed the agreement we will 
have to implement. This still lies ahead of us and calls for a 
lot of work. 
  [Scemama] Gen. Baraq, after the first Oslo agreement senior 
military sources whose identity I do not know said the Army was 
not let in on the negotiations and criticized this fact. Now 
there is harsh criticism about the excessive involvement in the 
political negotiations of officers dressed up in suits and ties. 
You must probably be aware of this criticism. 
  [Baraq] In both cases the criticism did not come from within 
the ranks of the Army. We think the decision not to let the 
Army in on the details of the negotiations about the Oslo 
agreement was right. It is not that I or the chief of 
intelligence did not know that an agreement was in the works or 
about some of its contents. The prime minister and the foreign 
minister did the right thing by refraining from sharing with us 
what clearly are political decisions about which there is a deep 
and legitimate argument within Israeli society. 
  On the other hand, it becomes vital to include security 
officials the moment the agreement must be put into practice and 
discussions begin about security arrangements along the roads, 
the security circles around the settlements, joint patrols, the 
role of the Palestinian police force, and the activities of our 
forces. After all, when all is said and done, we are the ones 
who will have to move to the other side of the table and proceed 
to implement it the day after the agreement is signed. Our 
platoon commander must know what his duties are, what he can and 
cannot do; the Palestinian policeman and the Israeli settler who 
is being given protection must know what to do, and I believe 
the Israeli public also must know. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Israel obtained 
everything it wanted from the security deal agreed with the 
Palestinians in Cairo, Defence Ministry spokesman Oded Ben Ami 
[spelling as received] said 10 February. 
  "The very fact of reaching an agreement is in itself 
positive," he told AFP. "That shows that we got what we wanted." 
  The Ma'ariv newspaper headlined: "Security top brass happy, 
'All our main demands have been accepted'." 
  The daily quoted triumphant security officials 
congratulating 
themselves on the pact signed by PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on Wednesday [9 February] 
night. 
  Israel keeps control of the border and crossing points, 
Jewish settlements and roads leading to them for the five-year 
interim period of autonomy. 
  Ben Ami said Israeli and Palestinian delegations would next 
week resume talks on the military, civilian and economic aspects 
of autonomy, in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba and in 
Paris, in a bid to seal an overall agreement to launch self-rule. 
  "We are now going to try to put into practice the principles 
expressed and signed in Cairo. A lot of questions remain to be 
answered," Ben Ami said.

<F P=106> [Report by Army affairs correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] General Staff is 
satisfied with the Cairo agreement signed between the PLO and 
Israel on 9 February. A military source yesterday said that 
"under the present circumstances, it is the best agreement." 
The source asserted that both sides had conceded on points they 
would not have compromised on in the past, and the General Staff 
feels this is the best possible agreement. 
  Senior IDF sources said that the test would be the 
implementation of the agreement. According to a military 
source, the IDF has reacted positively to the agreement, but 
many details have yet to be worked out and many difficulties are 
to be expected before the agreement can be implemented. 
  IDF sources stressed that the Cairo agreement is being 
perused in detail by top military officials and every detail is 
being examined from a professional standpoint. A senior IDF 
source said: "in general, it is a good agreement. Most of our 
interests have been protected, especially the security interest." 
  According to the senior source, several issues still remain 
unresolved even after the agreement, such as the matter of the 
Palestinian police and the way security measures will be handled 
at the border crossings. 
  IDF sources state, for example, that the procedures for 
crossing the Palestinian checkpoint remain unclear. According 
to the agreement, passengers crossing through the Palestinian 
checkpoint will walk through a magnetic gate. An Israeli and 
Palestinian guard will stand on each side of the gate, and in 
any suspicious case will be permitted to carry out a body search 
at the gate and to question the traveler. The IDF anticipates 
the possibility of problems and confrontations at the terminal, 
with each side demanding to check travelers. 
  The IDF is still studying the Cairo agreement and will 
establish staff teams over the next few days to analyze the 
agreements and implement them on the ground. Officers at the 
Central and Southern Commands are prepared to withdraw from the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho as soon as the political echelon issues 
the order. As reported by HA'ARETZ, the General Staff has 
formulated a plan that will enable the troops to withdraw from 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho within one month.

<F P=106> [Report by Aharon Klein] </F>
  [Text] A senior military source attached to the Southern 
Command yesterday said: "The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is 
deployed and ready to withdraw from the major population centers 
in the Gaza Strip and move to the blocs of Jewish settlements. 
The IDF will be capable of carrying out such an operation 
within one month." The source asserted that the preparations for 
the dismantling and evacuation of the military bases were mostly 
over while the preparations for the construction of alternative 
bases inside the blocs of settlements were at an advance stage. 
  The senior military source added that the Southern Command 
and the General Staff's Logistic's Branch have been making 
preparations for a withdrawal over the past few months, while 
gearing themselves up to complete the evacuation process by 
mid-April 1994, as stipulated by the Document of Principles. 
The evacuation process was scheduled to start at the beginning 
of March and end in mid-April. "We can withdraw within one 
month and if necessary we can do it in even less time," the 
source said, noting that "obviously, the date will be decided by 
the political echelon. Therefore, one month for evacuation is 
sufficient time as far as we are concerned. We have carried out 
more difficult things before." 
  The IDF will summon hundreds of drivers for reserve duty to 
help carry out the withdrawal. Some of the drivers have already 
received calls to report to reserve duty. These drivers will 
help transfer the equipment and the structures in trucks and 
transporters from the IDF bases inside Palestinian population 
centers in the Gaza Strip. "Everything that is supposed to be 
transferred is already marked, noted down in the catalogue, and 
anchored in detailed evacuation plans," the source noted. "In 
most cases, all we have to do is to load the equipment on the 
truck or transporter and start driving."

<F P=106> [Israeli names as received] </F>
  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 11 (AFP)--Operation Rainbow, the 
Israeli Army's plan to withdraw on the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank town of Jericho, is ready following the Cairo security 
agreement for Palestinian autonomy, officers say. 
  "As soon as the government gives the order, we will start 
the 
withdrawal," a military spokesman told AFP, but he refused to go 
into detail. 
  "We are wound up and ready to go into action," one senior 
officer told Friday's [11 February] YEDI'OT AHARANOT newspaper. 
  Military officials said planning is complete for the 
operation which will see troops pulled out of Jericho and 
redeployed in Gaza. Army bases will be dismantled and moved from 
built-up areas on the strip where Israeli forces will remain to 
protect the 4,000 Jewish settlers. 
  Chief of Staff General Ehud Baraq has already appointed the 
appropriately named General Hagai Shalom, a logistics 
specialist, to carry out Operation Rainbow. 
  The Army has asked the government for another 100 million 
dollars on top of 83 million already allocated for the 
withdrawal. 
  More than 50 million dollars is being spent to build a 
60-kilometre (36-mile) fence around the Gaza Strip. A seven 
kilometre stretch has already been completed. 
  The fence, the same as one put up along the border between 
Israel and Lebanon, is intended to prevent infiltrations. The 
system includes electronic gates and continuous patrols. 
  Southern region command will oversee the operation on the 
Gaza Strip and the Central Region Command will take care of 
Jericho. 
  As soon as the orders are received, Army bulldozers and 
trucks will move to take down the razor fences, the watchtowers, 
observation posts, water and fuel storage facilities and so on 
which clutter the landscape of the occupied territories. 
  All the equipment removed will be stored in temporary camps 
while new installations are built. Soldiers from combat units 
will have to sleep in tents until new barracks are constructed. 
Water pipes, drains and electrical systems will be destroyed. 
  Palestinians have watched with great pleasure the first 
moves 
with the Army quitting several posts in Gaza in recent weeks and 
the departure of the hated occupier from the refugee camps is 
expected to produce an outpouring of emotion. 
  According to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres Israel will 
strive to pull troops out without further delay, 
  "We are not committed to the April 13 deadline," Peres said 
referring to the target date for Israel to complete the 
withdrawal under the September 13 agreement. 
  "However I think we will all make a real effort to reduce 
the 
delay because our people also wants to be convinced that the 
agreement is workable." 
  The start of the pullout, scheduled for December 13 under 
the 
agreement, has been held up by disputes centered on the security 
aspects of autonomy. 
  Israel and the PLO settled most of the differences in Cairo 
on Wednesday night, although Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is 
insisting all outstanding issues on autonomy, including 
economic, be resolved before the withdrawal begins. 
  Rabin said he expected that to take at least another month 
while senior Army officers said it would take only one month for 
the withdrawal to be completed.

  [Text] Responding to reports from Syria and Lebanon 
alleging that the Israel Defense Forces [IDF]] is reinforcing 
its troops, a senior military source says that the IDF has not 
beefed up its forces in the security zone in Lebanon. Speaking 
to our reporter Yo'av Aviv, the source said that the reports 
came in the wake of fears of a harsh IDF retaliation following 
the incident in which four soldiers were killed and five injured. 
  Official military sources also denied an IDF beef up in the 
security zone.

Palestinians in the valley."] 
  David Levi, chairman of the regional council, claims that

Arabs have been illegally building in several locations in the

  [Text] Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid, secretary general of the 
Islamic Conference Organization [ICO], urged India to revise its 
inhuman policy on occupied Kashmir and adopt a path for the 
peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in 
accordance with the UN resolutions. In a statement on arrival 
in Islamabad today on a two-day visit to Pakistan, he said the 
legitimate aspirations of the Kashmiri people cannot be crushed 
by force. The ICO secretary general said the Indian atrocities 
have crossed the limits on which the ICO is deeply concerned. 
The large-scale massacres in Sopor and Kupwara, in which 
hundreds of people were martyred, have dealt a deep blow to the 
Islamic world. He said the ICO will move a resolution at the UN 
Human Rights Commission meeting currently being held in Geneva 
to halt the human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. 
  On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the secretary general said our 
efforts 
are to get the use of force against Serbs authorized by the UN 
Security Council and also get the unjust and illegitimate arms 
embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina Government lifted.

  [Text] Pakistan has rejected the Indian allegations of 
terrorism saying the uprising in occupied Kashmir is a result of 
repression and the denial of Kashmiri's right of 
self-determination by India. This was stated by a Foreign 
Office spokesman in Islamabad today. He said the Indian 
External Affairs Ministry's statement blaming Pakistan for the 
deteriorating situation in held- Kashmir is totally baseless. 
The Indian accusation came in the wake of the statement by the 
head of the U.S. South Asia Bureau, Miss Robin Raphel, that the 
two conflicts in Afghanistan and Kashmir were similar which are 
exacting a terrible toll of civilians. 
  The spokesman said it is not only the United States, but 
almost every member of the United Nations which understands that 
the killings in occupied Kashmir are the consequence of the 
repression of Kashmiri people's quest for the right to 
self-determination. The Indian accusation about terrorism, the 
spokesman said, has been disproved. He said if India believes 
in its own propaganda, it should agree to Pakistan's proposal to 
station UN observers group For India and Pakistan or any other 
impartial monitors along the Line of Control in Kashmir.

<F P=106> [By Munir Ahmad Khan] </F>
  [Text] It is widely assumed that Pakistan has achieved 
nuclear capability and can exercise the nuclear option if and 
when in the future a political decision is made in this regard. 
This capability has been earned at great technical economic and 
political cost. As time passes, Pakistan will be subjected to 
even stronger pressures to compromise on the nuclear issue and 
roll back or even abandon its nuclear programme. National 
interest demands that we retain our nuclear option as long as 
India does as it may take India a considerable time before it 
agrees to subscribe to the Non- Proliferation Regime for Sough 
Asia as has been proposed by Pakistan. During this period 
Pakistan has to maintain its nuclear capability. The question 
is now can we sustain our nuclear option. 
  Realistically speaking, pressures on Pakistan will mount and 
not decrease with time. The US commitment to non-proliferation 
is toughening and not receding. World public opinion is turning 
against nuclear weapons even in the hands of nuclear powers and 
certainly more and more against the so-called near-nuclear 
weapons states such as India, Pakistan and Israel. There is 
hardly any difference of views among the nuclear-haves that 
further proliferation has to be contained. So we will have very 
few or no allies to back us up. We may even be on our own. 
  The assumption that once a country acquires nuclear 
capability it cannot be eroded or taken away is rather naive and 
an illusion. While it takes considerable technical skill and 
political determination to achieve this, in the first place it 
needs even greater effort to retain it later on. France was a 
nuclear rebel until the 1980s but the changed international 
situation and pressures from its partners in Europe and across 
the Atlantic compelled it to conform to the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty] South Africa was able to build a small 
nuclear arsenal by defying international embargoes over a long 
time, but found it politically impossible to hold on to it and 
had to surrender 8 or 10 nuclear bombs it had built. Ukraine, 
with its 1,600 nuclear warheads, ranks as the third nuclear 
power in the world and has sophisticated long-range missiles to 
deliver them to any part of the world. Yet it cannot even 
service this arsenal. Its economic and security compulsions 
have forced it to give up this formidable capability. Even the 
UK finds it harder and harder to hold on to its modest stockpile 
of nuclear weapons in spite of its imperial longings. 
  It appears that its is relatively less difficult to climb 
the 
nuclear ladder but much harder to hang on after getting there. 
We should not underestimate the challenges we will face in 
sustaining our nuclear option and must prepare ourselves to do 
all that it takes to keep it. 
  While it will become increasingly hard for us to retain our 
nuclear option it is relatively easy to lose it. The quickest 
way to do this would be to increase our nuclear rhetoric to win 
greater public applause at home. This nuclear jingoism which 
our politicians and technologists have engaged in to win cheap 
popularity has been extremely costly to the nation. It has sent 
completely wrong signals abroad and played into the hands of our 
opponents. It also provides a ready excuse to India to continue 
with its massive nuclear programme. It is, therefore very 
important that both the government and the opposition and all 
responsible leaders of various parties exercise restraint when 
talking about the nuclear issue. This is needed particularly at 
a time when the US Congress has started debating a revision of 
the Foreign Assistance Act which could hopefully dilute the 
Pressler Amendment and provide an opening for the US President 
to resume US Pakistan cooperation in the economic and defence 
fields. 
  Even if the Pressler Amendment is somehow miraculously 
withdrawn or circumvented it will only be a temporary relief. 
The nuclear issue between the US and Pakistan will not be 
resolved as the US will continue to pursue its objectives 
through other means. India will persist in strengthening its 
nuclear muscle and reach posing a growing threat to our 
securing. The stakes will get higher and higher. The strategy 
we should develop must be one which enables us to keep the 
nuclear option open for a long time. This means we should take 
immediate steps to reduce our vulnerability to outside pressures 
and build up the strength and stamina to resist coercion. 
  Politically we need a renewed commitment to our nuclear 
programme and to maintain the nuclear consensus. The Government 
and Opposition have to speak with one voice so that there is no 
rollback and no unilateral compromise. This demands a measure 
of political maturity on all sides. We have to take the nuclear 
issue out of the political areas so that it is above petty 
politics. 
  Economically, Pakistan is extremely vulnerable. Our 
dependence on foreign economic and financial aid has to be 
reduced. We have to put our economic house in order. This 
requires making tough and unpopular economic decisions which is 
not an easy matter for any political government. But we can not 
expect the aid donors to underpin our economy so that we enjoy 
the luxury of wasting funds at home and continue to postpone 
economic reforms. Without a strong economy no country can ever 
maintain a nuclear option. 
  In the defence field, we are highly dependent on foreign 
military supplies equipment and hardware. India meets 80 per 
cent of its defence needs through indigenous production while we 
are critically dependent on imports. We have to build our own 
defence industry. It will require a bold new approach to 
mobilise our internal technical and human resources, involve the 
private enterprise and establish the essential infrastructure 
for our defence industry which we have neglected so far.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "American designs in South Asia"] </F>
  [Text] A clue to the designs of American strategies can be 
found in the latest offer of two American companies to supply 
India with sophisticated modern electronic warfare systems. 
This is a significant change in American policy in this region. 
Earlier, the US Government had warned India to desist from 
developing its own indigenous warfare system, and if it did not 
heed this warning, the US would sell its advanced airborne 
warning system to Pakistan. It seems that India stopped the 
work on its own AWACS and started negotiations with the US for 
the supply of electronic equipment needed by the Indian Air 
Force. Now not only will India continue its research and 
development programme for its own AWACS but will also have the 
benefit of incorporating within its advance warning system that 
latest electronic equipment supplied by American firms. 
  This change in American policies will give to the Indian Air 
Force a huge advantage over all its neighbours. Now India will 
be able to develop its own Airborne Surveillance Platform and 
also that of obtaining the American AWACS. This will vastly 
improve India's air defence as well as increase its air attack 
capabilities. The Indian Air Force is already a formidable force 
and much too large for the comfort and security of India's 
neighbours, but with the additional electronic systems from the 
US it will acquire the status of a local or mini superpower, a 
dream that has obsessed many Indian leaders. 
  As long as America needed Pakistan to further American aims 
in the region, it had warned India to puruse its hegemonistic 
plans in the whole of South Asia, but should leave out Pakistan, 
because it was not within the South Asian region, but was part 
of the Middle East. Once the Soviet Union troops left 
Afghanistan and the USSR disintegrated, Pakistan's strategic 
importance, in the estimate of US policy makers, declined 
sharply. Pakistan was no longer needed to contain Russian 
communism, nor to prevent Islamic resurgence in what was once a 
part of the USSR. America now encourages India to look upon 
this region as its sphere of influence. 
  This development must be studied carefully by our policy 
makers and steps devised to counter these sinister developments 
in our region. Pakistan is not Nepal, Maldives or even Sri 
Lanka to accept tamely the Indian hegemony in this region. We 
can join with other countries in the region to devise plans 
which will be beneficial to all countries in South Asia, we can 
cooperate with our neighbours to make South Asia a region of 
peace and to ensure the sovereignty and security of all the 
countries, small and large in the region. Pakistan cannot under 
any circumstances accept the hegeony of India. Pakistan can sit 
down with all countries for the working out of arrangements that 
guarantee the security of the region and also safeguard the 
sovereignty of all countries. This can be done only when all 
countries sit down as equals and have a dialogue as sovereign 
states. 
  Pakistan must protest against this preferential treatment of 
India by the US and use all its diplomatic resources to persuade 
Americans not to pursue their one sided policies in South Asia. 
Pakistan can not be bullied into accepting so grossly unfair and 
humiliating an arrangement as seems to be in the making in 
Washington. Pakistan has no hegemonistic dreams and will not 
allow any country in its neighbourhood to nurse such dreams. 
The people of Pakistan and the defence forces of the country 
are fully determined and capable of defending their sovereignty 
and will defeat all attempts made to reduce this proud nation 
into a client state of any country no matter how large or 
powerful. 
  Indian leaders have started to threaten Pakistan with dire 
consequences if it does not stop its support of the Kashmiri 
mojahedin, and some even go so far as to claim that India is 
incomplete without Pakistan. We have no desire to strike a 
jingoistic stance and would advise Indian leaders to make a 
sober assessment of the situation and learn to live peacefully 
with its neighbours. India will have to give up its 
hegemonistic dreams and must accept the existence of smaller 
states. It has gigantic problems of its own which should 
receive all its attention. We have seen the performance of the 
Indian army in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Any military adventure 
might act as a boomerang and give rise to civil turmoil and 
disintegration within the complex and divided Indian society. 
Instead of dreaming of setting up an Indian Empire, Indian 
leaders would do well to serve their own people by deverting 
their huge defence spending to socially useful projects which 
would save India's millions from starvation.

<F P=106> [By Mushahid Hussain] </F>
  [Text] Within the first week of February, senior officials 
of the American State Department have come out with policy 
statements regarding South Asia which provide some insights into 
the Clinton Administration's emerging view of a region that has 
assumed great strategic importance in the post-cold War world. 
  There were two statements by Assistant Secretary of State 
for 
South Asian Affairs, Robin Raphel, the first on February 4 
before the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on 
Near-Eastern and South Asian Affairs and her second was an 
address to the Asia Society. The other was a statement from the 
US Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, 
Lynn Davis, who said on February 7 that in regards the nuclear 
issue, the United States "will be looking at India and Pakistan 
equally and together as we seek to craft a non-proliferation 
strategy" for South Asia, thereby publicly accepting that 
American policy cannot be selective or discriminatory. 
  Robin Raphel's two statements are the first from her as 
public policy pronouncements regarding American perceptions of 
South Asia. Three aspects of the American view of South Asia are 
instructive. First there is acceptance by the United States of 
the reality that both major South Asian countries, India and 
Pakistan, are "nuclear capable and each is also apparently 
intent on acquiring ballistic missiles." There is a greater and 
more realistic view of security perceptions in South Asia when 
Robin Raphel stated before the Asia society that "large 
constituencies in both countries firmly believe that their 
nation's security is best assured through a nuclear capability." 
The American official also recognises in the statement that 
neither India nor Pakistan can be "easily persuaded" to forego 
the nuclear option. 
  The second major tenet of American policy towards South Asia 
pertains to the announced objective of "launching a multilateral 
process to promote arms control non-proliferation and regional 
security" and in this regard, the American official discloses 
that "both India and Pakistan already accept the mulitlateral 
approach in principle but details must be worked out." 
  The third important aspect of the Raphel policy statement 
was 
in equating what she described as the "civil war in Afghanistan" 
and the "insurgency in Kashmir." In equating the two, a civil 
war with a genuine liberation movement whose problem requires 
resolution under a United Nations administered plebiscite to 
which America is also formally committed at least to the extent 
that it is a party to those resolutions, the United States is 
viewing both Afghanistan and Kashmir as sources of instability 
and violence that need to be defused and contained rather than 
Kashmir as a dispute requiring resolution under universally 
acknowledged principles of self- determination. This 
distinction is important because the approach of the United 
States will then be different since containing a problem and 
resolving a problem are two different sets of machanisms. 
  The American policy statement also is specific in the 
context 
of Pakistan, particularly since it is the first public official 
Washington view of this country following the October 1993 
elections. Some insights into the American perspectives on 
Pakistan as enunciated by the US top policy-maker on South Asia. 
  -- There is sigh of relief that the "forces of moderation 
continue to prevail" since expectations before the elections 
about the "triumph of extremism" or that Islamic fundamentalist 
parties were predicting big gains have been proven wrong. 
  -- The October 1993 elections are handled as "the first and 
fairest in many years and it is specifically cited that these 
elections were "closely supervised by the military under Chief 
of Army Staff Waheed" thereby acknowledging the Pakistan Army's 
"honest broker" role in national politics. 
  -- Without saying so in so many words, the American official 
seems to be enclosing the ending of "a period of divided 
government in Pakistan" with Presidency going to Farooq Leghari 
a PPP [Pakistan People's Party] leader who in her words. "was 
selected to be President". 
  -- There is a word of advice to the PPP government with the 
formulation that "we are hopeful that the new leadership will be 
able to work with the Opposition led by former Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif to overcome political gridlock". 
  -- As was to be expected, the American State Department 
official lauded Moin Qureshi as providing "an excellent example 
of statesmanship and dedication of good government for the 
region and the world". 
  Interestingly, on India the accent of the policy statement 
is more on economic ties than a strategic military connection 
which was what the Indians were expecting and desperately 
wanting after the end of the Cold War. For instance, the US 
official stated that "there was more investment by American 
companies in India in 1993 than in all the years since 
independence, 20 per cent of all Indian exports come to the 
United States, the US is the largest source of foreign 
investment and commercial technology for India and the US 
Commerce Department has designated India as one of the 10 major 
emerging markets in the world to receive special attention as US 
formulates its worldwide strategy". Robin Raphel also cited an 
important fact that major American corporations have recently 
launched an "India Interest Group," which means that despite 
Pakistan being the economic leader of South Asia in 1991 when 
the reform process began in the region, today, India has easily 
overtaken Pakistan as the country in South Asia which is the 
primary and perhaps the sole recipient of American economic 
interest and investment. 
  Three strategic realities define these emerging American 
objectives in South Asia in the post-Cold War world. First, 
American political influence is more extensive and more 
pervasive in South Asia than at any time before, more so because 
it is no longer confined to Pakistan and it encompasses India as 
well. As Robin Raphel told the American Senate, "with the 
ending of the Cold War, South Asians recognised that the United 
States is now the outside power best building to assist them." 
There is no competing influence from Russia now. Interestingly 
for the first time, the United States is trying to build a new 
intimacy with the Pakistan Army on the basis of America's 
political clout without any tangible expression of support via 
military hardware or financial grants, as was the case during 
the Cold War years in the 50s and the 60s or the Afghanistan 
period in the 80s. But the problem is that on certain core 
issues for Pakistan like the nuclear programme, Kashmir and 
relations with China, American policy is at variance with 
Pakistani objectives. Hence the foundations of any new special 
relationship between the two sides or their respective 
militaries will be lacking. 
  The second basic reality defining American interest in South 
Asia is the China factor, with the Peoples Republic of China 
emerging as the area on which American strategic pressure is 
bound to be felt till the end of the century. China is all 
emerging economic giant with military power and political will 
to assess an independent posture in world affairs and although 
it is not interest in filling any vacuum created by the demise 
of the Soviet Union, China certainly is no pliant country 
acquiescing to American hegemony. It is thus no accident that 
the United States as well as the West generally are cultivating 
all of China's neighbours from Korea to Kyrgyzstan with the 
Americans talking to Pyongyang and normalising ties with Vietnam 
as well. With the British putting pressure on Hong Kong close 
to its unification with the mainland in 1997, the Americans are 
interested in the South Asian region as as a potential area to 
monitor and pressurise China, especially its minority provinces 
like Tibet and Xinjiang which border India and Pakistan 
respectively. 
  South Asia and Pakistan particularly, are also the gateway 
to 
Central Asia and hence Pakistan is also able to influence 
developments in neighboring Afghanistan which, in turn, impinge 
on Cental Asia, hence the Americans view South Asia and Pakistan 
in particular, as an extension of the Central Asian region, a 
fact acknowledged in Raphel's statement to the Asia Society when 
she said that "we must also recognise the importance of outside 
factors-- concerns about China, developments in Central Asia and 
Russia--in the South Asia security equation." 
  However, the American stated and unstated agenda for South 
Asia-- preventing tensions and conflict between India and 
Pakistan, focussing on India as a large market for American 
goods and technology, and Pakistan as a potential observation 
post for china, Iran and Cental Asia--present serious problems 
given the fact that on key areas vital to Pakistan's national 
security like Kashmir and the nuclear issue there is still no 
real fresh and radical departure from long-standing American 
policy. US policy can no longer keep pace with either the 
ground realities in Kashmir or the fact that Pakistan has long 
embarked on the path of nuclear independence which cannot be 
rolled back either under foreign pressures or pliable 
governments. As long as this reality gap is not bridged on 
vital issues, with American policy still far removed from the 
ground reality on the Kashmir and nuclear questions, American 
policy making will be reduced to an adhoc, reactive, 
moment-to-moment approach rather than a strategic perspective 
what is required in these troubled times.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Unwarranted Outbursts"] </F>
  [Text] The Foreign Office in Islamabad has reacted strongly 
to the unsavoury remarks made recently first by Indian 
President. Dr Shankar Dyal Sharma, and later by the country's 
Minister of State for External Affairs, Salman Khurshid. And 
rightly so. The remarks focussed on the person of Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto, which apart from violating established 
norms of diplomacy, reflect poorly on India's case on Kashmir. 
What has actually agitated the minds of the Indian leadership, 
causing the kind of outbursts as have more come out of Delhi, is 
the Pakistani PM's expose of Indian atrocities in Kashmir before 
the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva Even if President 
Sharma's attack on Ms Bhutto's family problems is accepted at 
face value. where is the connection between the PM's 
differences with her brother and the Indian troops's gross human 
rights violation against the people of Kashmir? if anything. Dr 
Sharman's words are of an oppressor desperate to deflect world 
opinion from the real issue. Salman Khurshid's diatribe against 
the PM in which he likened her to a hot air balloon about to 
seem to come from considerations of a different nature -- that 
of a minority community member trying to prove his credetials in 
the Congress which has brought him in primarily as a showpiece 
of the so-called Indian secularism. Hence it is understandable 
to see a carerist like him repeating parrot-like what his 
benefactors want him to say. 
  But then he he is not the only Muslim who is willing to do 
the dirty work for his masters. farooq Abdullah before him had 
taken upon himself to do the same, though only to be humbled and 
chased out of the Valley by the power of Kashmiri people's urge 
for freedom. A test case for the Sheikh's position having any 
relevance to the concerns of his people would be for him to go 
back and try living in the Valley. Such a venture on his part 
can easily demonstrate who the hot air balloons really are. It 
is sad that toadies and frontmen of New Delhi have no sense of 
shame in pleading a case that stands widely condemned not only 
by Muslim nations but several of those countries as well which 
had traditionally been supportive of India's stand vis-a-vis 
Kashmir. People like the Sheikh and Khurshid may have an 
uncontroliable desire to get public positions at any cost from 
their paymasters but inpursaing these goals they can sve 
themselves from a great deal of embarassment -- that is, if they 
are capble of feeling embarassed -- by asking themselves if they 
are capable of feeling embarassed -- by asking themselves if 
they should be doing all this at the expense of the blood of 
their fellow Muslims.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Nuclear Program -- New Element in </F>
the U.S. Attitude"] 
  [Text] According to the influential U.S. daily THE 
WASHINGTON POST, the United States is preparing to launch air 
strikes against nuclear installations in Third World countries. 
A Defense Department official has been assigned the task of 
determining how Third World nuclear installations can be 
targeted for U.S. air strikes. 
  It is known that -- following China -- India, Pakistan, and 
now North Korea are Third World countries that have been the 
topic of international media discussion regarding their nuclear 
strength. India officially detonated a nuclear bomb in 1974, 
becoming a de facto member of the international nuclear club, 
but the United States has not paid much "attention" to India's 
nuclear program since then. On the other hand, when Pakistan 
achieved the capability to enrich uranium during the last 
decade, the United States started raising objections to 
Pakistan's nuclear program. It adopted a policy of 
"overlooking" Pakistan's nuclear program, though, because of 
Islamabad's courageous stand during the "Afghan war." After the 
end of the Afghan war in 1990 and the disintegration of the 
erstwhile Soviet Union as a superpower, however, Washington 
declared Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program a "weapons-oriented 
program" and stopped all military and economic aid to Islamabad. 
This aid has still not been resumed. The Pakistani people will 
be rightly concerned about this talk of targeting nuclear 
installations in Third World countries. 
  There have been serious differences between the U.S. and 
Pakistani stands on Pakistan's nuclear program. In the opinion 
of the Pakistani people and several governments, the U.S. 
Administration -- under the influence of the Israeli and Indian 
lobbies -- has refused to accept the "peaceful" nature of 
Pakistan's nuclear program. This is the case even though 
Islamabad has given assurances at the international level that 
it will not build and has not built any nuclear weapons, despite 
having the ability to do so. Washington's stand, however, is 
that Islamabad is making nuclear weapons and that it should roll 
back its nuclear program. 
  The U.S. Government is putting its entire emphasis on making 
Pakistan "abandon" its nuclear program and sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT. In response, the Pakistani 
Government has always adopted the stand that it is ready to sign 
the NPT provided that India -- which is a major nuclear power in 
this region -- signs the treaty first. It is regrettable that 
the United States views Pakistan's nuclear program in the 
perspective of its wider global priorities; this is why it has 
only been pressuring Islamabad to sign the NPT. 
  Some changes in this situation have recently become 
discernible in the wake of remarks in certain U.S. circles, 
especially by Ms. Robin Raphel, chief of U.S. South Asia Bureau 
[title as published]. Washington now appears to understand 
Islamabad's view better than before. 
  Lynne Davis, the U.S. under secretary of state for 
international security, has said that as far as nuclear 
proliferation is concerned, Washington will adopt an evenhanded 
approach to both India and Pakistan. Nevertheless, we should 
not indulge in any wishful thinking in the wake of statements by 
Ms. Robin Raphel and Lynne Davis, nor should we start to think 
that the U.S. Government's stand has completely changed and is 
now tilting in favor of Pakistan. In fact, the U.S. 
Government's basic stand -- the basic objective of U.S. policy 
-- is to have South Asia declared a nuclear-free zone. This 
element in the U.S. attitude is favorable to Pakistan, because 
Washington will no longer view Islamabad in isolation from the 
South Asian perspective on the nuclear issue; rather, it will 
view Pakistan's nuclear program from an overall perspective. 
  In view of continued U.S. pressure on Pakistan's nuclear 
program, we consider Washington's new attitude a welcome shift. 
Yet we must express our regret that Pakistan is still the 
victim of discriminatory laws, such as the Pressler Amendment, 
intended to make Pakistan the target of "vindictive actions." 
Even though India detonated a nuclear device in 1974 and has 
subsequently built nuclear weapons, the United States does not 
think it is necessary to take any "action" against New Delhi, 
which continues to receive all sorts of U.S. assistance. We 
would also like to tell our U.S. friends that the imposition 
against Pakistan of such discriminatory laws as the Pressler 
Amendment has not helped -- nor will it help in the future -- to 
rid South Asia of nuclear weapons. The sooner the U.S. 
Government and its policymakers understand this fact the better, 
because U.S. policy objectives cannot be achieved by making 
Pakistan the target of "discriminatory laws."

  [Text] According to a report by a BAKHTAR military 
correspondent, as a result of the attack by forces of the 
Islamic army, four enemy posts have been captured in the 
direction of Chehelsotun by units of the Islamic army. [words 
indistinct] were killed in Jangalak and around Bala Hesar and a 
number of others were injured. To compensate for their repeated 
defeats, the infamous militia today targeted residential areas 
of Kabul City with savage rocket attacks. As a result a number 
of our innocent compatriots were killed or injured. In addition 
to the loss of lives, the landing of rockets caused much 
material damage too. The artillery of the Islamic army 
responded to the savage rocket attack of the infamous militia by 
crushing the enemy positions in Maranjan hill and Charasiab with 
heavy weapons fire. As a result extensive loss of life and 
heavy damage were inflicted on the infamous militia. According 
to another report, this morning an aeroplane of Dostam's militia 
stealthily bombarded residential areas of the city. Fortunately, 
it caused no loss of life, but much damage was inflicted on 
residential areas.

  [Text] Reports from Kabul suggest that an unofficial 
cease-fire has come into effect there. This is at a time when 
the residents of Kabul face growing problems in connection with 
obtaining food. 
  In the meantime, the warring sides in Afghanistan have 
rejected rumors that an official cease-fire has been announced 
in Kabul. One official from Rabbani's faction said: The current 
cease-fire is a result of bad weather, snow, and the month of 
Ramadan and it is not, in any way, an official cease-fire.

Golboddin Hekmatyar appealed to Iran to take an active role for 
restoration of peace in Afghanistan. 
  In a telephone conversation with Iran's Minister of Foreign

belligerent parties to end the conflict and has launched 
mediation efforts to this end.

  [Text] The Supreme Court of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan [ISA] condemns the Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin coup 
attempt, and considers the ISA a legal government. The court 
describes the uprising against the ISA as a rebellion and its 
perpetrators as rebels. According to a report by Bakhtar 
Information Agency, the leadership and officials of the Supreme 
Court of the ISA held a session at the headquarters of the 
Supreme Court yesterday. In the meeting they insisted that 
because the president of the ISA has been elected by the 
Resolution and Settlement Council, and later this election was 
approved under different agreements by leaders and jihadi 
parties or their representatives, obedience to him is the 
Islamic duty of all citizens of the country. As a high judicial 
source of the country, the Supreme Court supports the order of 
the president for jihad against the infamous triangle of 
Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin, and it asks our all faithful people to 
take part in this holy jihad.

  [Text] Colombo, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Government troops Monday 
concluded a limited weekend offensive against Tamil guerrillas 
in northeastern Sri Lanka, destroying a rebel camp and seizing 
dozens of anti-personnel mines, officials said. 
  About a thousand troops backed by air and sea cover returned 
to base in coastal Trincomalee following the operation over the 
weekend against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
rebels in the region, officials said. 
  Troops destroyed an abandoned LTTE camp that included 15 
well- fortified bunkers and ten small accomodation units, a 
military spokesman said. They also recovered about 50 
anti-personnel mines from the rebel camp, he said. 
  "The Tigers left the camp to avoid confronting advancing 
troops. One soldier was wounded when he stepped on an 
anti-personnel mine," the spokesman said. 
  The latest offensive was part of a military campaign to 
flush 
out LTTE rebels in parts of the island's north and the entire 
east ahead of key local government elections in the region on 
March 1. 
  The LTTE, which is fighting for a separate state in the 
northeast for Sri Lanka's minority Tamils, have vowed to disrupt 
the polls in northern Vavuniya, in Trincomalee and the 
neighbouring districts of Batticaloa and Ampara.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Azadi </F>
Square, Tehran, on 11 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] May God keep you. May God protect you dear ones, 
you brave Islamic community. Thank you very much for your 
kindness and good words. To calm the crowd, let us all chant a 
slogan in honor of the Prophet. 
  In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. It is 
truly a shame that our dear Imam [Khomeyni] and martyrs cannot 
be with us today to see this splendid scene of the extensive 
presence of the Islamic ummah in Freedom Square. Of course, 
their blessed spirits are with us and they can witness this 
glorious gathering, these enthusiastic sentiments and this 
historical epic. 
  I can see in the surrounding areas, in all the streets 
leading up to this square -- as far as the eye can see, there 
are crowds hastening and rushing toward the square, chanting 
slogans, although they know they will not arrive in time for the 
ceremony. They keep coming, however, just to say, we are here 
just as always. I would like to thank them most humbly and I 
would like to praise their intelligence, awareness, loyalty and 
sincerity. 
  Undoubtedly, today, on 22 Bahman, beginning the 16th year of 
this glorious revolution's life, hundreds of millions of eyes 
are gazing at this spot from throughout the world and, tonight, 
hundreds of millions of people will sit around their television 
sets to see images of this splendid gathering and to renew, once 
again, their hopes in the future of Islam's revolution and to 
revitalize themselves for greater action and jihad. And our 
enemies are watching the streets of Tehran with anxiety and with 
the false hope that, with the passage of time, our people will 
become alienated from the revolution or indifferent to it. God 
willing, they will take this hope to their graves. 
  The people can sense the presence of the revolution in their 
lives with all their existence and this tangible sense that they 
have of the effects of the revolution will not allow them to 
forget it, even though the new generation does not have any 
memory of the past and cannot compare the post-revolution 
society with the pre-revolution one. However, it has heard from 
others and from history and it knows. And, even if it does not 
know about the past, it can compare its own society with other 
societies. They can compare this society where the names of 
heaven, the Koran and the lofty commandments of Islam fill the 
air with their perfume with those other societies where 
blasphemy, atheism, apathy, and secular systems invite the 
people to be immoral and unjust, to discriminate, to submit to 
sensual pleasures and ungodly ways. The new generation, too, is 
suitably equipped to make this comparison, assessment and 
judgement. 
  Sixteen years ago our nation which had gathered in this very 
Azadi Square and streets leading to the cemetery and waited to 
see its imam had not seen the present days. This is the main 
difference between the young generation then and the young 
generation now. At that time they looked to the future and 
today they see the manifestations of the divine promises. Many 
of the manifestations of dualism, oppression, corruption, and 
tyranny which ruled over our society have gone. The 
manifestations that had turned everywhere, the television, 
radio, school, university, seaside, street, movie theater, 
theater, newspapers and magazines to centers of vice, lust and 
corruption of the youth. All things were contaminated with the 
corrupt western culture. But wherever they look today they see 
the Koran, Islam, call to justice, propagation of virtues and 
prohibition of vice, prayers and justice. 
  The furthest we go from the capital and move into the heart 
of villages and the border regions, the affects of the 
revolution are better felt. There they know that all services 
once used only in the capital and several large cities are now 
provided to all parts of the country. Schools, electricity, 
drinking water, roads for transport, telephone and post are 
being provided to distant villages and places in the deserts in 
the same fashion that that they are provided for the cities. 
They see that the country's means are being used in the more 
distant places for development and construction. In the past 
few days people have heard that 1,600 development projects in 
deprived areas and thousands of more development projects across 
the country have started operations. The radio and television 
and the press have reported on some of these but the people who 
live in those areas feel their effect. The further we go from 
the capital, the people are happier, fresher, more hopeful, more 
participant, and more loyal to the revolution. 
  With such background and realities the news of imperialism 
is 
wasting its time uselessly. The more they propagate the less 
they achieve. The more they seek to blackmail through 
propaganda the less the result. In fact on the contrary, the 
false propaganda reminds the people of the world -- who might 
gradually forget the revolution if left to themselves -- to 
study our revolution and thus we add to the supporters of the 
revolution every day across the world, despite all the dreadful 
propaganda. They have left no accusation and lie. For years 
they accused us of terrorism but the world does not believe it. 
The people across the world can see the hands involved in 
terrorism. People know the victims of international terrorism. 
In Iran people have seen and buried enough victims of terrorism 
and today continue to visit the grave of their martyrs for 
prayers. How could they believe the American accusations that 
Iranians are terrorists and support terrorists in the world. 
  They accuse Iran of violating human rights. But their own 
hands are in the the people's blood up to their elbows and their 
whole being is involved with usurping human rights. Bosnia, 
Palestine, Somalia, and other places are witness to this claim 
of ours. If today they raise any issue regarding social justice 
and global peace, the people of the world will not believe them 
when they witness the Bosnia-Herzegovina case. But the people 
of the world see that truly the Islamic Republic declares that 
we are ready to despatch 10,000 soldiers -- who will take their 
lives in their hands -- to Bosnia at our won expense so as to 
establish peace and consolidate security but they do not let us 
in because they know we will be supporting righteousness and 
peace over there, which is something that they do not seek. 
  The claim of human rights violation against Iran falls on 
deaf ears among nations; although the media and mercenary news 
agencies propagate such claims. That fails to have any effect 
on our nation. All their propaganda arrows have hit granite. 
They have begun an extensive propaganda onslaught so that they 
might make our nation despair about the future and become 
discouraged. But even there the palpable effects of the 
revolution do not allow them to succeed. They embark on economic 
sanctions, put pressure on our income resources. They wish to 
damage us -- at the expense of their own friends -- by making 
oil prices plummet. But tomorrow they will see that even those 
actions will bring about a reverse result; something that is 
quite palpable today. The world will notice that such words are 
no longer of any effect. 
  In these 15 years -- and specifically in its First 
Development Plan -- the Iranian nation succeeded in carrying out 
infrastructural work in such a way that the oil price fall can 
no longer inflict any general damage to this country and or to 
the revolution since plans have been made to replace oil revenue 
by various means. At one time we needed to sell oil and import 
goods for all our consumer requirements so that our people could 
live. But those days have now passed. Today our factories take 
the main part of their raw materials -- from steel, copper, 
lead, and zinc to aluminum -- from what we produce ourselves. 
And our other factories take the main part of their 
requirements from our own petrochemicals. And our laborers 
today work with indigenous, Iranian and national materials. Our 
specialist forces have taken the place of foreign advisors and 
experts to such an extent that in no arena does our nation feel 
the need for any foreign expert force. And if there is a special 
case there are adequate numbers of those who would take a wage, 
work, and take orders. The Iranian factories do not need to 
make use of arrogant forces. 
  More than 90 percent of the country's consumer goods are 
being made in our own factories and workshops. Our nation, our 
farmers, our cattleowners, our poulterers, and our fishermen 
have been able to meet the society's required food supply by 
their own efforts and with the aid of their system and 
government. And export a great deal as well. 
  They thought that, with all the machinery in our possession, 
we would be dependent on spare parts. With the extensive 
measures that were taken in relation to making and designing 
spare parts inside the country, according to a very firm policy, 
during the past five years, today, we do not need to import any 
spare parts for a great deal of our industrial equipment. 
  Our universities are rapidly supplying our required work 
force. The dependence of our communications on foreign resources 
has been reduced to a very small amount. 
  They can indulge in as much propaganda as they like to 
dishearten our people, but our people can see how things are for 
themselves. They saw how their regime pursued two very 
difficult programs at the same time: one, economic adjustment, 
and, two, economic development; giving priority to 
infrastructural and cultural tasks. They saw how it travelled 
this path with success. They can also see how our own neighbors 
are having so many difficulties in carrying out their policies 
of economic adjustment and of changing their structures. 
  Can this have any reason other than that our people are 
present on the stage, are vigilant, are aware, support their 
regime, endure the problems that result from this revolution 
treading along its difficult path by itself, obey the eminent 
leader of their revolution [Khamene'i], are loyal to the path of 
their eminent late imam, value the blood shed by their martyrs 
and draw inspiration from the dear families of martyrs, those 
missing in action, the war disabled and the former POWs and from 
the proud POWs and war disabled themselevs, who are the torches 
guiding this country. And the hizbollah forces throughout the 
country, in villages, towns, factories, schools, universities, 
offices -- everyone can see among themselves everywhere these 
intelligent, dear and determined supporters of the revolution. 
  They can see the armed forces [crowd interrupts chanting 
slogans] -- thank you for your good words and sentiments. They 
see the Armed Forces, the Revolution Guards' Corps, the proud 
Mobilization forces, the Law Enforcement Forces and the other 
sectors at the service and in great support of the revolution. 
This great body is participating in all villages and cities 
across the country. Everywhere you will see something similar to 
the Azadi square where intelligent and enlightened people have 
come to express their loyalty, strength, and steadfastness. 
Reports I have received since this morning indicate that across 
the country people are using their time, effort, and voice at 
the service of the revolution and Islam today. Your 
participation will make the faltering tongues of the world 
arrogance stutter even more for sometime and will shut them up. 
And even if they scream and yell it will only hit a mountain 
that will return it to them. I sincerely thank your honors and 
the dear students who carried out such a sweet song so well in 
this great square and all those who organized and managed the 
good programs for the Ten Days of Dawn celebrations. May God 
keep you. God willing we will meet again in the other venues of 
the revolution. May God's blessings and peace be upon you.

  [Text] A nine-point resolution was issued at the end of the 
rally, which was endorsed by the people's chants of: God is 
great, and Khamene'i is the leader. 
  The resolution praises God almighty for the victory of the 
blessed Islamic revolution in Iran, led by His Eminence Imam 
Khomeyni--may God be pleased with him--and also praises the 
self- sacrificing devotees, particularly of the Islamic 
revolution, and the martyrs of the imposed war. The resolution 
mentions: Now that the bright sun of Velayat, the pious chosen 
guide, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the eminent leader of 
the Islamic revolution, is leading this great nation, we 
consider as a good omen the auspicious simultaneity of the 
spring of the Koran, the holy month of Ramadan, with the start 
of the blessed 16th anniversary of the Islamic revolution. We 
announce that we consider the wise and reviving guidelines of 
the great leader of the Islamic revolution and the founder of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, His Eminence Imam Khomeyni--God's 
blessings upon him--as the fundamental and inviolable part of 
the domestic and foreign policy of the holy system of the 
Islamic Republic. We will not cease our endeavors to the last 
of our breath, until the aspirations of that great imam have 
materialized. 
  The marchers stressed the unconditional obedience of the 
Iranian nation to the guidelines of the eminent leader--an 
obedience that they considered as a religious obligation and as 
the only way of salvation for the Islamic ummah--and expressed 
their firm support for President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the serving 
government, the Majles, and the judiciary. Furthermore, they 
asked the officials who are serving in the country's three 
powers to use all their abilities to secure social justice, 
eliminate deprivation and shortcomings, prevent corruption in 
the administrative organs, discourage a propensity towards 
luxuries and waste, and finally to hasten the process of the 
country's reconstruction and development. They also asked the 
officials to take serious steps toward rejuvenation of the 
principle of enjoinment of virtue, prohibition of vice. It is a 
principle that constitutes a solid point of reliance for the 
Islamic revolution. 
  The resolution also stresses the need for the officials to 
pay greater attention to the material and spiritual needs of 
youth and to give greater value to the Basiji culture, which is 
a great source of support for the Islamic revolution. The 
resolution, moreover, pays tribute to the lofty status of the 
martyrs and the eminent families of the martyrs, the disabled, 
released POWs, the Baijees, and all the selfless devotees of the 
Islamic revolution. It asks the serving government to consider 
the needs of these beloved ones in its comprehensive and 
long-term plans. 
  In another part of the resolution, the marchers reiterated 
that they still considered the U.S. Government as the great 
Satan, responsible for all the anti-Islamic plots and 
atrocities, and the main supporter of the aggressive acts of 
international Zionism. They emphasized the need for 
confrontation against the conspiracies of the great Satan. 
  Furthermore, the marchers expressed their support for all 
authentic Islamic movements and condemned the dastardly crimes 
of the Serbs and the silence adopted by international forums 
toward such crimes. They also condemned the compromise between 
'Arafat and Tel Aviv and asked the Muslim nation of Afghanistan 
to end the process of fratricide as soon as possible and to put 
all their efforts behind reconstructing their Islamic homeland 
and countering the conspiracies of the enemies.

  [Text] Incoming reports indicate that after three days of 
efforts, U.S. President Bill Clinton was finally able to set up 
a telephone contact with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin 
yesterday and discuss the NATO ultimatum to the aggressor Serbs 
who are violating Security Council resolutions. 
  Russia, which is considered to be an ally and supporter of 
the Serbs, does not have a positive view on the recent NATO 
ultimatum and wanted this issue to be discussed by the Security 
Council. However, apparently the 30-minute telephone 
conversation between Clinton and Yeltsin has reduced the extent 
of the differences of opinion between the two sides on the 
West's decision and on the ultimatum. After the telephone 
conversation, Moscow stated that the United States and Russia 
have agreed on a division of tasks among the conflicting sides 
in Bosnia that will eventually help to overcome the Bosnian 
crisis. 
  Before the Clinton-Yeltsin discussion, Russia's UN 
representative had called for an extraordinary Security Council 
session. However, after the telephone conversation, he 
rectified the objective behind such a session and stated that 
what Russia has in mind is the dispute over the disarmament of 
Sarajevo. 
  The truth is that currently not only the Russian Government 
but the Russian opposition parties have adopted a negative 
stance on the ultimatum. Some political experts believe that 
even though Yeltsin's flexibility toward Clinton stems from his 
interest in Washington's support for Moscow, politically it will 
lead to the weakening of Yeltsin's position at home. Meanwhile, 
what Yeltsin attaches hopes to is what the rest of the world 
feels: the West's deceitful stance, which weakens the 
possibility of a NATO attack on the Serbs. 
  The West's policy of double standards on international 
crises 
and differences in its acts and deeds on Bosnia have reached an 
intolerable point. In tandem with the West's warning to the 
Serbs and the setting of a deadline for the withdrawal of their 
heavy arms from around Sarajevo, the leader of the aggressive 
and criminal Serbs was able to gain UN agreement on forming an 
investigating commission to determine which side was responsible 
for the shocking massacre at Sarajevo market. The UN's 
agreement with this request is tantamount to the acquittal of 
the Serbs in this rare crime. 
  Actually, the West has granted the Serbs a concession 
vis-a-vis the ultimatum against them. Meanwhile, with the 
mitigation of pressures on the Muslims with the evacuation of 
positions around Sarajevo, they have added military pressures on 
Muslims in other parts of Bosnia. For this reason, the Bosnian 
representative at the Geneva talks disagreed with efforts to 
separate the fate of the Bosnian capital from the fate of other 
regions and stated that he wants a comprehensive agreement on 
Bosnia. 
  At a time when the European Community and its 
representatives 
in the Geneva talks, as well as the Croat and Serb sides, are 
seeking to dismember Bosnia, it is only the Bosnian Muslims who 
continue their jihad for preserving the integrity of the country.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb 12 (AFP) -- President 'Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's brother has resigned as head of Iran's 
state radio and television (IRIB), the daily KEYHAN reported 
Saturday. 
  Mohammad Hashemi, who was to leave his post on Saturday 
after 
12 years, is to be replaced by the Minister of Culture and 
Islamic Guidance 'Ali Larijani, it said. 
  The head of the ministry's publication bureau, Ahmad 
Pur-Nejati, has been chosen to serve as interim culture 
minister, the paper added. 
  IRIB has come under mounting conservative criticism. 
  Parliament's culture subcommittee issued a lengthy report in 
November which said many programmes had nothing to do with Islam 
or the Islamic revolution, and spread "un-Islamic" ideas, 
particularly among the young. 
  The report prompted a strong reaction from Hashemi, who 
accused the hardliners of promoting "stone-age" thinking. The 
conservatives hit back accusing IRIB's head of defaming 
parliament. 
  Newspapers said in December that Hashemi could face legal 
proceedings. 
  IRIB has been under the direct supervision of the country's 
spiritual guide since the 1979 Islamic revolution,

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 13, IRNA -- A Persian daily Sunday 
commented on the 10-day ultimatum given by the NATO to the Serbs 
and termed it as a propaganda maneuver to deceive the world 
public opinion. 
  In a statement released on Wednesday, the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) issued a 10-day ultimatum calling the 
Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo 
within a radius of 20 kms. 
  In its editorial, 'JOMHURI ESLAMI' said that on the first 
encounter, the statement was expected to be a response to the 
demands of the world public opinion to end atrocities against 
Bosnian Muslims. 
  However, a careful study of the context of the statement 
shows that once again NATO is following the policy of 
procrastination and is only posing as a decisive organization. 
Furthermore, it wants to make the world believe that it has 
made an effective and resolute decision. 
  The evidence available indicates to the fact that the main 
objective of the statement is mere publicity and that NATO would 
never enter into the scene against the Serbs who are carrying 
out the same mission favored by the U.S. and Europe. 
  It said that the U.S. and Europe were making efforts to 
provide further grounds to facilitate implementation of the 
mission by the Serbs. 
  NATO's goal is to pretend it has managed to take a stance 
against the Serbs while under the status quo the United States 
and Europe are working on an agreement to dismember Bosnia. 
  It turned to the statements issued by the Non-Aligned 
Movement (NAM) and the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), 
calling for a severe stand by the Security Council and the NATO 
against Serbs, and said that NAM has never shown decisiveness at 
decisionmaking level. 
  If NAM and the OIC use their deterrent levers to settle the 
Bosnian crisis, they have the necessary potentials, the daily 
noted, adding that this will be materialized in practice when 
all members have unity of expression and determination.

  [Text] The Majles had its open session today chaired by 
speaker Mr. Nateq-Nuri. 
  At the session, Mr. Nateq-Nuri thanked the nation for their 
wise and active presence at the Ten Days of Dawn ceremonies that 
culminated in massive and magnificent marches on February 11. 
  The massive participation of our sensible people at the 
marches, Mr. Nateq-Nuri said, once again proved to the world 
that the Iranian Muslim people have remained loyal to the 
revolution's causes and principles and are diligent in 
safeguarding its achievement and values. The Majlis speaker 
then urged the officials to serve this brave and heroic nation 
more than before. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri further described as a deceitful scheme 
NATO's 
ultimatum to Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from around 
Sarajevo, adding that inwardly NATO, Serbs, and Croats are 
allies. 
  The head of the legislative branch later expressed hope that 
Muslims would no longer be deceived by their enemies' 
conspiracies and, with greater resolve than in the past, 
continue to defend the oppressed Bosnian people. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri then appreciated the stance of the Nonaligned 
Movement in backing the Bosnian Muslims.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "U.S. Role in the Bosnian Crisis"] </F>
  [Text] After setting a 10-day deadline for Bosnian Serb 
forces -- which was aimed at removing the Serbs' heavy weapons 
from around the besieged city of Sarajevo -- U.S. White House 
officials and Western circles have been overwhelmed by a wave of 
concern. Those concerns have arisen at a time when, after a 
threat by NATO to carry out aerial attacks against Serbian 
positions, the Serb paramilitaries said that they would defend 
themselves against any aerial attack and they might take action 
against the 12,000 UN soldiers in Bosnia. 
  Parallel with those threats, the U.S. and British 
Governments 
recommended that their representatives in the Serb-Montenegro 
alliance should leave because of the growing unrest that has 
been created as a result of the NATO threat. It seems that the 
U.S. and British response -- which has resulted in their 
recalling their representatives from Belgrade -- will end the 
American pretense of saying that the policy regarding the 
Bosnian crisis has been thought out. Also, this issue faces 
NATO's role in the current crisis with ambiguity. 
  Nevertheless, political experts believe that military 
intervention in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has only a 
deterrent meaning and is taken to mean psychological pressure on 
the warring sides; especially since there is neither any oil in 
the area nor has the area much geopolitical significance for 
Western Europe and America. Nevertheless, it is predicted that 
if NATO embarks on an aerial attack against the Serbs it will 
undoubtedly be taken as a measure to enhance the West's global 
image and to legitimize its action. 
  In fact the West's irresponsible rationalizing and the lack 
of serious support for the Muslims against the events in Bosnia 
have resulted in the true face of the Western forums and their 
evil objectives to become more evident than ever. It is clear 
for all that America assesses Bosnia, just like other world 
issues, from the angle of its own national interests. In the 
case of the Bosnia- Herzegovina conflict, the United States has 
adopted three different positions. At the beginning, Washington 
was playing the role of a neutral observer, thinking that the 
Yugoslav crisis was simply a European problem. With the passage 
of time and the spread of war in the Balkans, Washington then 
showed an inclination to play a political role in the crisis. 
  However, now we can see a change in the United States' point 
of view. The American Government intends to increase its role 
in the Bosnia peace negotiations to force the Muslims of that 
country to accept the disintegration of Bosnia and lose control 
of Sarajevo. Now, under the guise of NATO, the U.S. Government 
is not showing the slightest inclination toward a fair 
resolution to the differences, and, if NATO implements its 
threats on air strikes, the region will enter a period of 
protracted and useless ground conflict. 
  Therefore, the surest way to stop the time killing policy of 
the West in the Bosnian crisis is to give the responsibility of 
defending Bosnian civilians to the rightful owners of that 
country, namely the Bosnian Government; so that under those 
conditions, the Muslims can manage to take effective steps in 
defending their obvious and usurped rights and in the final 
condemnation of the Serb aggressors.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton announced yesterday that 
if North Korea prevents an inspection by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] of its nuclear installations, 
economic sanctions will be imposed. These remarks by the U.S. 
President came exactly one week after North Korea called the 
United States a paper tiger and stated that it will be the loser 
if another war breaks out in the Korean subcontinent. 
  Despite agreements in principle between the United States 
and 
North Korea last month, during the past couple of weeks a strong 
propaganda war has been waged by the two countries. Pyongyang 
believes that on the pretext that North Korea is manufacturing 
nuclear weapons, the United States is engineering plots to cause 
a war with North Korea. From Pyongyang's point of view, even 
though North Korea has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact 
and has allowed the IAEA to inspect North Korean nuclear 
installations, the IAEA--influenced by some countries--has acted 
contrary to its main duties and is aiming imaginary accusations 
at North Korea for political reasons. 
  At any rate, for 10 months the topic of North Korea's 
nuclear 
arms has been a gauge to measure the pressure in relations 
between Washington and Pyongyang, and this pressure has 
fluctuated from threats to encouragements. 
  The recent U.S. threat to impose economic sanctions on North 
Korea can be studied on two levels. The first is the level of 
bilateral relations, in which case the sanctions will not be 
very effective. The second is the level of collective acts, in 
which case the United States will face two problems. The first 
problem is that it is difficult to attract the attention of 
countries, especially the permanent Security Council members and 
specifically China, on this issue. The second problem is that 
if these threats materialize, the crisis in U.S.-North Korean 
relations will enter a dangerous phase because if North Korea is 
put under economic pressures, it may resort to acts that will 
have unfavorable consequences.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "President Aliyev's Visit to </F>
Turkey"] 
  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev headed a high-ranking 
delegation to Ankara yesterday. His visit was the first to that 
country after he was elected president. Drawing attention to 
the not-so-warm relations between Aliyev and Ankara during the 
past year, political commentators have assessed his visit as 
rather important. According to the commentators, Baku wishes to 
improve its relations with the regional countries, establish a 
balance in its relations with Azerbaijan's neighbors, and 
benefit from Turkey's economic resources. 
  However, it will be recalled that the Turkish Government 
maintained its support for former President Elchibey in 
Azerbaijan even after he was ousted. In view of that, several 
observers are convinced that Geydar Aliyev is trying to 
strengthen his position by using the existing opportunities in 
the region to promote the interests of his country, which is in 
a state of war. So considering the long-standing hostilities 
between Turkey and Armenia, Ankara's support for Aliyev is of 
special importance. 
  Meanwhile, the ousting of Turkey's ally in Azerbaijan, that 
is, the removal of Abulfaz Elchibey from power, inflicted a blow 
to Ankara's policy on the Caucasus. Obviously, Turkey wishes to 
increase its influence in the region through intensive 
diplomatic initiatives. In view of that, Ankara has hinted that 
it is inclined to melt the ice between Turkey and Azerbaijan by 
adopting an understanding approach to Baku's requests in various 
fields. 
  Furthermore, the political commentators believe that Turkey 
is worried by the success the nationalists achieved in the 
elections in Russia and is convinced that the Caucasus may be a 
source of threat to its security in the future. In view of 
that, it wishes to strengthen its relations with Azerbaijan in 
order to safeguard its long-term interests. However, 
considering the possibility that Russia, which regards the 
Caucasus as a strategic region, may seriously react to Turkey's 
increasing influence, Ankara wishes to achieve its objective 
through economic and cultural exchanges and not through 
political and military initiatives. 
  Meanwhile, Moscow, which adopted a sensitive approach on 
Turkey's influence in Azerbaijan and the support it gave to 
Abulfaz Elchibey in the past, is seriously watching the progress 
of the relations between Ankara and Baku with a view to 
safeguarding its interests in the region. 
  Considering all that, President Aliyev's visit to Ankara is 
very important, as assessed by President Suleyman Demirel, Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller, and Speaker of the Turkish National 
Assembly Husamettin Cindoruk. In fact, it is regarded as a new 
landmark in the relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] After two days of intensive talks in Cairo, the PLO 
leader and the foreign minister of the Zionist entity yesterday 
signed a bilateral agreement on security issues. Although 
nothing has been disclosed about the details of these talks, the 
statements made by the Palestinian and Israeli parties 
demonstrate that the main differences and pending issues remain 
unresolved. Reaching a solution will require very prolonged 
talks. The latest 'Arafat- Peres meeting, the third over the 
past two months, focused on extricating bilateral talks on the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement from an impasse. 
  It is well-known that Israeli stalling prevented 
implementation of the agreement's clauses, which should have 
taken effect on 13 December 1993. Israel put forward its own 
interpretations and analyses of the clauses of the agreement, 
which practically blocked its implementation. Political 
observers believe that despite the fact that both Palestinian 
and Israeli parties declared that they reached a limited accord, 
Zionist officials have reneged on implementing the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement by putting forward new interpretations of its 
articles. Under the latest agreement the Zionists imposed 
Israeli military supervision of the crossing points and border 
points in Gaza and Jericho with the participation of Palestinian 
police. This means that Zionist forces will continue to impose 
their control over the self-rule areas, albeit with a 
Palestinian police cover. According to the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement signed in Washington, control of the crossing points, 
bridges, and border points separating Gaza and Jericho from 
Egypt and Jordan is the responsibility of the interim government 
in the self-rule area. From the outset of the negotiations, the 
Palestinian party emphasized the Palestinians' sole right to 
control the crossing and border posts along with other tasks in 
their occupied homeland. The Zionist entity, as usual, resorted 
to blatant stalling, refusing to implement the agreement's 
clauses on the scheduled date in order to impose conditions on 
the Palestinians and to shake the PLO leader's standing among 
the Palestinian people. These complications have further 
darkened the prevailing pessimistic atmosphere in the occupied 
lands regarding the agreement and the possibility of 
implementing it. The Palestinians, who were at first 
enthusiastic and pinned hopes on the United States, have now 
begun to wonder if it is really possible to regain their usurped 
rights through diplomatic means from the usurper Zionist entity.

<F P=106> [Address by the "leader of the Iranian resistance" Mas'ud </F>
Rajavi on the eve of the 11 February anniversary--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Compatriots; resistant and noble people of Iran: 
  Fifteen years have elapsed since the victory of the 
antimonarchical revolution and the domination of the reactionary 
government of Khomeyni. Our people reached the point where 
they could stand the dictatorship of the shah's puppet 
government no longer and rose up and succeeded in toppling it 
with their magnificent revolution of 11 February 1979. The 
objective was to establish freedom, independence, and the 
peoples' sovereignty over the country's capital and national 
resources so they would be used for the prosperity and happiness 
of the people of Iran. They also wanted equal opportunity for 
Iranian youth so they would grow in a society based on justice 
and the rule of law. [passage omitted] 
  In truth, how many ordeals we have endured! There is no 
doubt that regardless of how much we speak of the cruelty and 
crimes of Khomeyni, his treachery and destruction, it still does 
not do it justice. The destruction of the social structure, and 
of institutions of economic development can be appraised on the 
basis of statistics regarding the Khomeyni era. We have 
regressed by 50 years and perhaps we have lost the opportunity 
for growth and development to the same extent. Can we even 
truthfully know at what juncture Iran and its people stand? 
Certainly not. Khomeyni's crimes and treachery are, of course, 
limitless. [words indistinct] 
  For all these 15 years, the conditions in Iran have been 
like 
the two sides of a coin. We have always been and still are in 
the crucible of a test--a contest for the existence or 
destruction of a nation, one historic for our great nation. In 
this turbulent era of upheaval, [words indistinct]. On the one 
side of the coin is the reality of the tyranny and devastation 
inflicted by the Khomeyni regime. On the other side of the coin 
is the sacrificial resistance of a wounded nation, unprecedented 
in today's world, without any exaggeration. The passage of time 
will highlight both sides of the coin clearly and more precisely 
and will continue to do so. [passage omitted] 
  Compatriots, if we view in retrospect the dimensions of the 
treachery and destruction of the Khomeyni regime, we were the 
ones in the past, the Iranian resistance who [words indistinct]. 
The performance of the clerics is so black and disgraceful that 
they are forced to admit it themselves or to complain about 
domestic shortages which in some way come about during the 
course of their domestic strife and tussling. In any case, the 
regime has itself divulged the extent of the devastation it has 
caused. 
  The dimensions of the economic bankruptcy of the regime is 
such that they themselves state openly that all the oil income 
for the next year will be less than the amount of the arrears on 
foreign debts. The estimated income from oil sales is less than 
or [words indistinct] the calculated foreign debts of the regime 
is approximately (?$50) billion. [passage omitted] 
  Details of the tortures inflicted by the Khomeyni regime 
cannot be covered in this brief speech. Only after these filthy 
fiends are toppled will the goings on in their torture chambers 
be revealed. Hands amputated, eyes gouged out, stonings to 
death, people hurled from heights -- these are only a few 
(?examples) of the 15 years of heinous atrocities perpetrated by 
the Khomeyni regime. As regards thievery, pillage, 
misappropriating public property, depositing oil income in 
private accounts, the clerics have (?surpassed) criminals. 
[passage omitted] 
  The people of Zahedan, Mashhad, and Arak [words indistinct] 
rose up against the brutal clerics, demanding the freedom of the 
people. The regime's agents are becoming helpless in the face 
of these cities and their residents. At the same time the axis 
of the sources of emulation and the leadership of the regime is 
atrophying and presents a decrepit and tattered (?image) more 
than ever before and is becoming weaker and weaker. According 
to Khomeyni, the Velayat-e Faqih should be a source of emulation 
before anything else. 
  We heard that the head of the regime's judiciary and its 
executions, the cleric Yazdi, announced that [words indistinct] 
and they can express support but not intervene in judicial 
affairs. The sources of emulation can speak on the (?minor 
points) of how to offer prayers, but they should not enter 
politics. How strange that the fate of the Khomeyni regime is 
such that God has inflicted his curse on them and each one says 
something different and thus appears more and more ludicrous. 
One day Khomeyni said that we would fight the war for 20 years, 
until victory; Jerusalem through Karbala'! What spurious 
slogans! Later he said: I made a mistake and I have taken the 
chalice of poison! [passage indistinct] 
  The people and the popular forces should know that [words 
indistinct] that the elite of Iran's offspring are in the ranks 
of the National Liberation Army and are endowed with the essence 
of heroism and combat capabilities. They have always said that 
this regime must be toppled. God willing, it will be, under the 
aegis of (?their efforts).

<F P=106> [Interview with Rasul Movahedian-'Attar, ambassador to the </F>
Czech Republic, by unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [DENNI TELEGRAF] What is the 
situation regarding partnership with the Czech Republic? 
  [Movahedian-'Attar] The Czech Republic and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran are traditional and amicable partners. As you 
know, political and economic relations between the two countries 
began to flourish after 1930 and have continued to grow during 
the subsequent decades. Many Czech businessmen and enterprises, 
including Skoda, entered the Iranian market before World War II 
and gradually acquired a good name and reputation for themselves. 
  The two countries import all sorts of goods and commodities 
from each other and they have been technical partners for a long 
time. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which has prepared a number 
of large and small projects worth almost $0.5 billion, is now 
considered to be the Czech Republic's most major technical 
partner. It is to be expected that in the future the volume of 
these projects could exceed more than $1.0 billion. The largest 
Czech project in Iran is the construction of an aluminum plant 
worth more than $300 million. 
  It is also apparent that the Czech Republic -- in view of 
its 
current economic circumstances -- would like to be active in the 
Iranian arms market. I think that a more substantial 
partnership is rather unlikely in this regard, because Iran -- 
which is giving priority to its economic strategy -- has, 
compared with its annual gross domestic product, the smallest 
military budget of the 15 countries in the Middle East. 
  Moreover, during the past 15 years, my country has managed 
to 
establish its own successful military industry, which enables it 
-- to a certain extent -- to satisfy the army's needs, and we 
are even capable of exporting some things. 
  We get the other most up-to-date and technologically 
exacting 
components -- as previously -- from the "Big Five." 
  In conclusion, Czech weapons are among the obsolete 
categories of Russian military hardware, which are unable to 
compete on the current saturated world market. It is obvious 
that the two countries are determined to follow the path of 
traditional, good cooperation that existed in the past and to 
keep in step in their relations. 
  Understandably, the main stress will continue to be placed 
on 
the technical and economic character of this cooperation.

  [Text] Doha, Feb 13 (AFP) -- Qatari state television late 
Saturday aired a report on Iraqis "suffering" from international 
sanctions, the first such program by a Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC) member since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 
  Shot in various Iraqi towns, the first in four episodes 
focused on complaints by Iraqis about the effects of the 
sanctions on their daily lives and comments by Iraqi officials. 
  Several of those interviewed said they could not understand 
why the embargo was being maintained "after Kuwait was returned 
to the Kuwaitis" and called for the Arab states to support 
Baghdad's position to have the sanctions lifted. 
  The UN embargo was imposed days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on 
August 2, 1990. 
  Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih also told the 
program that his country opposed a UN resolution allowing for 
the sale of limited quantities of oil under United Nations 
control. 
  Iraq says the restrictions for the sale harm its 
sovereignty. 
  Besides Oman, which has always maintained normal relations 
with Iraq, Qatar is the only GCC country to have restored links 
with Baghdad after it participated in the U.S.-led coalition 
that ousted Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991. 
  The GCC also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab 
Emirates and Bahrain.

<F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi--Sources in Abu Dhabi yesterday stated 
that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will soon visit the UAE 
[United Arab Emirates] capital on his first official visit since 
August 1990. 
  'Arafat is expected to meet with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al 
Nuhayyan, president of the UAE, and a number of senior officials 
to inform them of the new developments on the Middle East peace 
process and the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to conclude an 
autonomy agreement for Gaza and Jericho. The sources did not 
mention the date of 'Arafat's arrival in Abu Dhabi, but they 
expect it to be after the end of his talks in Cairo with Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  They asserted that a high-level UAE official had informed a 
delegation of the sons of the Palestinian colony in Abu Dhabi 
that the UAE had agreed to 'Arafat's visit. 
  The Palestinian president stopped at Abu Dhabi International 
Airport in October on the way from Indonesia to Turkey. He met 
in the airport with Shaykh Sultan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan, the 
deputy prime minister, and a number of senior UAE officials. 
  Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu Mazin), a member of the PLO executive 
committee, is the highest Palestinian personality who has 
visited the UAE officially since the Gulf war. 
  The sources state that 'Arafat will discuss with Shaykh 
Zayid 
the achievement of Arab interests and the PLO's relations with 
the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states. It is expected that 
he will discuss the PLO's financial situation and aid from the 
Gulf states for Palestinian autonomy with the UAE officials. 
  Shaykh Zayid has asserted more than once the UAE's 
continuing 
support for the Palestinian people and its intifadah in the 
occupied territories. The UAE has advocated offering financial 
aid of some $50 million within the framework of the aid, which 
will be offered to the autonomous areas in the occupied 
territories. 
  The UAE and the other member states in the GCC have 
supported 
the Palestinian-Israeli agreement that was signed on 13 
September in Washington, considering it a first steop toward the 
return of the Palestinian people's rights and the establishment 
of their independent state.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Ansi, secretary general of </F>
the Yemeni Reform Group and member of the National Accord 
Committee, in Sanaa, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo; date not 
given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Good morning, Mr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al- 
Ansi. Several dates have been mentioned for the signing of the 
Pledge and Accord document between the Yemeni president and his 
deputy. As a member of the National Accord Committee, can you 
tell us if a date has been agreed on for the signing of the 
document? 
  [Al-Ansi] Contacts were held with officials in the fraternal 
Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan. It was agreed in principle that 
the signing will take place on 20 February and that the final 
confirmation will be made on Saturday, God willing. This is the 
date agreed on in principle. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. al-Ansi, who will attend this signing? 
  [Al-Ansi] The signing will, of course, be witnessed by the 
Political Dialogue Committee and the former presidents of North 
and South Yemen, that is Marshal 'Abdallah al-Sallal, Judge 
'Abd-al- Rahman al-Iryani, and 'Ali Nasir Muhammad. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] What are the most important clauses in this 
document, which has taken a long time to formulate? 
  [Al-Ansi] The most important thing in it is its reference to 
the bases for building the modern Yemeni state, the state of law 
and order. This is manifested by the bases on which this state 
will be established. Then there are the state's establishments 
and structures as represented by the Presidential Council, the 
government, and the Chamber of Deputies. A council has been 
established, the Shura Council. It also refers to the economic 
and administrative structures and lastly to the issue of 
building the armed and security forces. We regard these to be 
the important bases for building the state. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Does this document satisfy the ambitions and 
requirements of the two sides, that is, the president and his 
deputy? 
  [Al-Ansi] This document represents the common denominator 
that binds all the influential forces in Yemen. As I told the 
Voice of the Arabs previously, the issue is not about the 
president and his deputy but about the country. It is the issue 
of developments in Yemen that might not have been understood and 
that probably have not been handled properly. Therefore, these 
developments expressed themselves in this crisis. It is true 
that the president and his deputy are regarded as the face of 
the crisis, but the latter is much deeper than this. Everyone 
involved in this document was motivated more by a patriotic 
feeling than by partisan calculations. It does not represent a 
specific party or specific political force but the common 
denominator binding all the forces that want what is good for 
Yemen. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] But Mr. al-Ansi, Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid has said that this document might be submitted to a 
referendum. Could this be done? 
  [Al-Ansi] It took us a long time to deal with this issue. We 
completed studying the constitutional, legal, and procedural 
guarantees for implementing this document yesterday. Discussion 
of what is required from the existing constitutional 
establishments took us a long time. There was a view that these 
establishments should support this document and that they should 
not be involved because implementation will be carried out 
through them. Their role will come after the document is signed 
and implementation begins. The Chamber of Deputies will have its 
turn when it comes to the constitutional amendments and the 
draft laws. The government's role will come when it lays down 
the plans and timetable for implementing the document. We 
concluded in our discussion that there is no need for a 
referendum. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. al-Ansi, you said that a consultative 
council has been set up. Does this mean that the existing 
parliament is not performing its role as required or that you 
felt the need to create this council? 
  [Al-Ansi] This is an extremely important question. I am 
glad you gave me the opportunity to explain what this 
consultative council is. First, regarding the name of this 
council, perhaps one could have found a better name than this. 
Discussions in this consultative council have focussed on dual 
legislation in Yemen. The answer from everyone was no because 
there is no justification for this duality. Agreement was 
reached from the very beginning that this council does not have 
any legislative responsibilities. The current parliament is the 
sole body responsible for legislative and administrative 
matters. The objective of this council is to sponsor the local 
government or local administration experiment and to express an 
opinion over the laws and judicial matters of the local 
government. Its main function is advisory. It has no 
legislative duties at all. Therefore, there is no contradiction 
between it and the parliament. Its existence does not mean that 
parliament is not performing its role as it should. This is not 
the case at all. The objective of this council is to represent 
the governorates, first and foremost, in development matters and 
in activating the administrative units so that they protect the 
interests of these units and supervise their activities. It has 
no legislative duties at all. It is a purely consultative 
council. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Will the assassinations that have taken place 
recently stop after the Pledge and Accord document is signed, 
and what is the fate of the Armed Forces command? Who will 
command the Armed Forces? This topic has been raised many times. 
  [Al-Ansi] Regarding the Armed Forces, there is a 
comprehensive agreement; there are measures stipulated by the 
document. These urgent measures include relocating the camps 
that were in what was called [word indistinct] before the unity 
to border areas and areas that need protection. This is the 
first step. After that, the comprehensive step of merging the 
Armed Forces completely will take place, after which they will 
be deployed in areas where they are needed. There is total 
agreement among all political forces in Yemen to make the Armed 
Forces neutral and turn them into a force that protects 
constitutional legitimacy that stems from the parliamentary 
elections. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Dear brothers, at the end of this dialogue, we 
thank you and Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Ansi, secretary general of 
the Yemeni Reform Group and member of the National Accord 
Committee. Thank you. 
  [Al-Ansi] On our part, we always thank the employees of 
Voice of the Arabs and express through this radio station our 
greetings to the Arab people in Egypt and through them all the 
Arab and Islamic nations.

  [Excerpt] Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of 
the Presidential Council; and brothers Dr. Hasan Muhammad Makki, 
first deputy prime minister; Brigadier General Yahya 
al-Mutawakkil, the minister of interior; and Muhammad Hasan 
Dammaz, minister of local administration today attended the 
graduation ceremony of the first group of district security 
officers and of other groups of graduates from training courses 
organized by the high police institute. 
  During the ceremony, which began with a recital of verses 
from the Koran, brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of 
the Presidential Council, delivered a speech in which he 
congratulated the graduates on their success in the course and 
on the approach of the holy month of Ramadan, wishing the Yemeni 
people many happy returns full of good fortune, welfare, and 
happiness. 
  He said the Political Forces Dialogue Committee today will 
finalize arrangements for the signing of the document of pledge 
and accord which the political forces completed last month. He 
hoped that the political leadership will sign this document 
within a week from today. This document was completed after a 
lengthy dialogue among the political forces because of the 
crisis which our country has been facing since 9 August 1993. 
  The brother member of the Presidential Council said that the 
crisis had negative effects on the various political, economic, 
and social fields, noting that it resulted in many things we 
hoped will never happen and the consquences of which will be 
assumed by those who caused it. He hoped that after the signing 
of the document, our country will enter a new stage of security, 
stability, and serious action in order to compensate for the 
events of the past period in which matters reached a state of 
paralysis in all parts of the country. 
  He added that thanks to God almighty and Yemeni wisdom, the 
Yemeni people and their political forces resorted to dialogue as 
a means to resolve problems. He noted that the dialogue led to 
this document to which we are committed and which we will 
implement, in text and spirit, because it contains many 
guidelines for tackling a number of political issues in local 
government, economic and security issues, the Armed Forces, and 
other issues that were the cause of this crisis. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Ghani hoped that the graduates will perform 
their 
duty in this important security field with absolute sincerity 
and dedication. He noted that all our Yemeni people and those 
working at the Interior Ministry, who shoulder a primary 
responsibility of maintaining the country's security and 
stability, should pay more attention to security in our country. 
  Concluding his speech, he congratulated the graduates and 
valued the teaching staff's great efforts and sincere work to 
render this course a success. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 14 (AFP)--The Yemeni Government is trying 
to win the release of three Chinese technicians who were 
kidnapped while helping to build a road in Yemen's rugged 
northeast, Chinese Embassy officials said here Monday. 
  "We hope they will be freed in the next few days," a Chinese 
diplomat said. "The Yemeni Government is working hard for their 
release." 
  The three were kidnapped Saturday morning while working on a 
road between Hija, 127 kilometers (75 miles) north of Sanaa and 
Ma'rib, 173 kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital, embassy 
officials said. 
  Yemeni sources meanwhile said the Chinese were kidnapped by 
three people wanted by the police for various murders. 
  There were no details on what the kidnappers wanted and 
where 
they were holding the technicians. 
  The three were working under the terms of a Yemen-Chinese 
cooperation accord. In the 1980s China helped the former north 
Yemen build several roads, including one between Sanaa and Hija. 
  The Chinese were kidnapped the same day that Ahnum tribesmen 
in the country's northwest freed three French tourists they had 
held for 20 days in a bid to force the government to build a 
road through their region.

<F P=106> ["Text" of address by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on 10 </F>
February; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In this chaste month, which 
God endowed with numerous virtues and declared that it be a 
month of solidarity and charity, and in which we have been 
ordered as Muslims to fast, we would do well to rise above our 
differences, discard our mutual hatreds, be patient and wise, 
put the interests of the homeland before all other interests, 
rally together, and heal the rifts as enjoined by the spiritual, 
exalted values preached by our virtuous Islamic faith -- the 
religion of brotherhood, equality, freedom, and justice. 
  This year, the holy month of Ramadan begins after the 
expanded National Dialogue Committee completed the accord 
document, which is just waiting to be signed. The delay may 
have been an act of God so the signing of the document would 
coincide with the early days of this month, during which human 
beings are closest to God. 
  I take this religious and worthy occasion to urge all 
official and unofficial media to call a halt to vituperation and 
turn a new leaf in the life of our united Yemen and our 
pioneering democratic exercise. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to say how grateful and thankful I am to our 
steadfast and patient people who have borne all manner of 
distress and weathered the consequences and ill effects of the 
crisis. I would also like to reiterate that we are readily 
available for a joint effort with all the partriotic, unionist, 
benevolent, and dedicated forces to maintain the unity of the 
country and entrench the democratic choice, and work together 
toward the resolution of all issues and problems our homeland 
and people are facing in a responsible and brotherly spirit that 
puts the interests of the homeland before any parochial 
interests. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulayb: "'Arafat's Trip To Meet </F>
With Peres in Cairo Sparks Off Severe Disagreement in 
Palestinian Leadership"] 
  [Excerpts] Tunis -- Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has 
sparked off a severe disagreement inside the Palestinian 
leadership and among second-cadre Palestinians because of his 
trip to Cairo to meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. 
  'Arafat went to Cairo despite the Palestinian leadership's 
decision to send a delegation headed by PLO Executive Committee 
member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and including Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), 
to be joined there by Nabil Sha'th, 'Arafat's adviser, and 
Faysal al-Husayni from the occupied territories, as Mahmud 
'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) refused to head the delegation, insisting on 
his previous position, namely not to return to the negotiating 
table until progress has been made and results produced in 
"'Arafat's negotiations." [passage omitted] 
  According to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's sources, this solution 
appealed to a number of PLO Executive Committee members, as it 
saves 'Arafat's "face." 'Arafat was exposed to strong 
criticisms during the Palestinian leadership's recent meetings 
in Tunis because of the situation to which he has led the 
negotiations. Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that the negotiations file is now full of ambiguity and the 
issues have become confused as a result of 'Arafat's 
interference, since he led the negotiations to the Davos 
agreement, which ignores all previous agreements. 
  The sources criticize 'Arafat's practices and his 
noncompliance with what was agreed by Palestinian negotiators in 
the past. [passage omitted] 
  PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab has told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that huge and serious loopholes have emerged 
in Palestinian negotiation performance. Numerous forces warned 
about the danger of this even before the negotiations. And many 
people expressed this inside the Central Council, which endorsed 
the Declaration of Principles agreement. 
  Al-Najjab adds: "The most marked loophole is the 
nonexistence of a body to refer to or an integrated negotiation 
plan." Al-Najjab stressed that after the present negotiations in 
Cairo the causes of these loopholes will be examined and ways of 
tackling them explored. 
  He said that the only way out of the present situation in 
the 
negotiations is to return to what the Central Council decided, 
namely the need to set up an authority for the negotiations, 
draw up a plan for them, and select professional and political 
capabilities to continue this process. And also to adhere to 
the negotiation mechanism specified by the declaration of 
principles agreement to secure the required agreements, whether 
with regard to Gaza and Jericho, the transitional phase, the 
final agreement, and so on. 
  Al-Najjab said that the Israelis feel that the time factor 
is 
in their favor, which is why they are resorting to 
procrastination to gain more time and continuing their previous 
policy before the Declaration of Principles agreement is 
implemented. 
  Another Palestinian official, who asked to remain anonymous, 
told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: The Israelis want now to consolidate 
the new negotiation mechanism between 'Arafat and Peres, because 
this mechanism gives more room to maneuver and play for time. 
The official did not conceal that as a result of the mechanism 
consolidated by 'Arafat, Israel is now in a better and more 
comfortable position, so they are now in a position to step up 
their conditions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan by Salah </F>
al-'Abd in Baghdad; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-'Abd] We are holding this 
interview amid the unjust economic embargo imposed on Iraq. 
This makes it the first topic in this interview. What new 
methods are there to confront the blockade against our people at 
this stage, particularly if it continues for a long time? Is 
there any new concept for confrontation on the local, Arab, and 
international levels? 
  [Ramadan] Much has been said about the blockade from the day 
it was imposed on Iraq before the military aggression. The way 
this blockade was implemented and applied and the way it was 
followed up demonstrates the intentions of the powers that 
imposed it. Today it is more obvious than was the case two 
years ago; more obvious than was the case on the first day that 
imposing and following up the blockade had nothing to do with 
what they claimed; namely, the issue of Kuwait. 
  When we view the details and nature of the dealing between 
the American United Nations and Iraq, it becomes clear that the 
imposition of the blockade was aimed at stopping the stage of 
Iraq's awakening which forms the beginning of the Arab nation's 
awakening. Had Iraq's stand been confined to the Iraqi region, 
the proportion of dealing with it would not have been on that 
level of bestiality. However, they are aware that any awakening 
in Iraq will serve the Arab nation no matter how they deepen 
differences and expand boundaries and parochialism. The Arabs 
will certainly reject this because they believe that whatever 
happens in Iraq reflects on them positively or negatively. The 
Arabs have expressed this in many meetings and activities in 
Iraq and the Arab world despite the pressures put on them by 
certain governments and regimes. These stands have vividly 
demonstrated that our Arab nation is one, that our Arab people 
are one people with the same fate, that the blockade's aims are 
now clear; namely, they are not linked to Kuwait. 
  The blockade is a struggle between the nation's awakening in 
confronting its enemies on the one hand and those who have 
vested interests in continuing hegemony over and exploiting its 
capabilities and various resources on the other. Therefore, it 
is the duty of each Iraqi and Arab to confront this condition. 
The Iraqi leadership, especially President leader Saddam 
Husayn, has never been under any illusion that the blockade 
would be lifted when the enemy slogan, which they had claimed 
was the cause of their action, disappeared. 
  The blockade will erode and wither away by building the 
society's own resources and will be completely lifted when the 
criminal enemies realize that it is impossible to achieve the 
aims for which they imposed this blockade on Iraq. 
  Any observer of Iraq's march, particularly after the 
cease-fire will clearly see that the progress achieved in Iraq 
was an expression of the slogan of building self-reliance 
leading to the blockade's erosion. A great deal has been 
achieved in the field of returning life to normal and building 
the pillars of renaissance in terms of quantity, quality, and 
originality. The efforts that were exerted cannot be compared 
with those exerted in various stages of building in the past, 
despite the fact that we had enormous material resources then. 
  The result of this is that the international position toward 
Iraq is not as unanimous as it was three or two years ago -- 
despite the fact that you still hear statements about blockade 
made in different accents, you no longer hear the single voice. 
Why? It is not because these parties are now feeling guilty 
about their previous positions on Iraq. It is because the 
Iraqis rose to the level of the battle and these parties 
realized that they will definitely not gain even the minimum 
amount of the benefits they thought they could gain from the 
blockade. 
  The states that have helped, and are helping, drag out the 
blockade will be sorry because they have lost a great deal of 
their interests with Iraq. This is not just an interpretation, 
but a fact. So many of these states have begun to speak 
publicly about their material and economic losses that resulted 
from the blockade imposed on Iraq. Why has this happened? If 
Iraq disintegrated or collapsed or if a foreign power was 
imposed on it, we would not have heard what we are hearing in 
various countries of the world. This contradiction will grow 
further in the future and will undoubtedly lead to the 
deterioration of the blockade, leaving in disgrace every one 
that contributed to it, regardless of the motives and reasons of 
this or that country. 
  As for the confrontation on the local, Arab, and world 
front, 
changes are interconnected. Any development in Iraq's power, 
responsibilities, and ability to stand fast will reflect on the 
Arab and international levels. 
  We say that 1994 is an important year and not like any other 
year of the blockade. The Mother of Battles has produced 
several facts and exposed the reasons and objectives of the 
blockade, as well as the enemy intentions. What Iraq has 
offered to the United Nations and its cooperation with it have 
deprived the real conspirators and those who were dragged by 
them of many cards. This is especially the case following the 
Iraqi position toward Resolution 715. We tell the United 
Nations and any other international party that they are 
responsible for the continued blockade. There is no 
justification for maintaining it, even from the viewpoint of the 
United Nations, now that Iraq has abided by all resolutions. 
  We absolutely confident that the Iraqi people will emerge 
triumphant. All nations will acknowledge the Iraqi people's 
contribution, strength, patience, and sacrifices. The Iraqi 
people have made great sacrifices to uphold the principles of 
justice, right, humanity, freedom, and independence. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Al-'Abd] What can you tell us about Iraqi-UN talks on 
resuming Iraqi oil exports? 
  [Ramadan] We do not view the lifting of the embargo through 
the resumption of oil exports as line with the UN formula. The 
UN formula is another form of the embargo against Iraq and the 
psychological harm done to the citizens. Yes, we want the 
embargo lifted and we want to resume oil exports, but without 
this infringing on our national independence and sovereignty. 
We want Iraq to sell and buy without any intervention from 
other powers. As for the current formula proposed by the United 
Nations for the resumption of oil exports, it is not acceptable, 
in view of its flagrant interference with sovereignty. We are 
confident that all the unjust formulas proposed by them under 
various covers -- which have been used as an umbrella to 
perpetuate the embargo and prevent Iraq from exporting its oil 
-- are now over. Therefore, they should now seriously consider 
lifting the Iraq embargo and allowing Iraq to export its oil. 
  [Al-'Abd] Are you optimistic about ending the embargo and a 
return of the economic conditions in Iraq to normal? 
  [Ramadan] I am optimistic that the embargo will end through 
the Iraqis' patience, resolve, and efforts to return life to 
normal, without being beholden to anybody else. This is the 
peak of pride for every Iraqi. In the year 1994, we should make 
more efforts than we did in the previous years of the embargo in 
the field of development, politics, spreading awareness, and 
mobilization, benefiting from the experience of past years. We 
will not begin from square one. We have a good background and a 
good experience by virtue of three years of hard work, day and 
night. 
  Yes, this should be our point of departure. And this will 
impose the willpower of the Iraqis and the good-intentioned from 
the sons of this nation on the enemies and criminals, primarily 
America and Zionism.

  [Text] Manama, Feb 11 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency has set up two cameras at an Iraqi nuclear site 
under UN resolutions for the long-term monitoring of the 
country's arms program, an IAEA official said here Friday. 
  "Two close-circuit cameras have been installed and activated 
in an engineering facility at Um al-Ma'arik (Mother of All 
Battles), 20 minutes from Baghdad, with two film cameras as a 
back-up," said Gary Dillon, a Briton, about the site that was 
part of Iraq's enriched uranium production program. 
  "The work was carried out without a hitch and the Iraqis 
were 
cooperative," said Dillon about his seven-member IAEA team that 
just completed a week-long mission in Iraq. 
  On Feb 4, IAEA deputy chief Maurizio Zifferero said experts 
from his agency would remove the last batch of Iraq's irradiated 
fuel and start setting up cameras at former nuclear sites. 
  The team was to have arranged removal of the five kilograms 
(11 pounds) of fuel believed to be left in Iraq. Some 35 
kilograms (77 pounds) were removed on December 5. 
  "The IAEA team will be back within two months to continue 
their work of installing surveillance cameras at maybe two or 
three more sites, where up to 20 cameras may be set up in 
total," Dillon said. 
  Another 11 chemical weapons experts, led by Horst Reeps from 
Germany, accompanied Dillon's team on Friday. It completed a 
10-day mission to identify and collect equipment Iraq had used 
in producing chemical weapons. 
  "We completed our mission of identifying, tagging and filing 
250 pieces of chemical production equipment of dual use nature. 
Part of these were used during the Iran-Iraq war," Reeps said. 
  "Our main aim was to get more information on the planned use 
of this equipment in the future. Iraq has said it intends to 
make use of them for the production of pesticides, 
pharmaceuticals and other chemicals," he said. 
  He said that some of the equipment was never used, some used 
on a regular basis and some would be the subject of new 
discussions with the Iraqis on their planned use. 
  In the hope of obtaining an end to a three-year embargo, 
Iraqi authorities are cooperating with efforts to dismantle 
programs for making weapons of mass destruction which are banned 
under UN resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war. 
  The embargo was imposed four days after Iraq's forces 
invaded 
Kuwait in August 1990.

  [Excerpts] Peace negotiations will again be in full swing 
this week. Tomorrow Israel and the Palestinians are to resume 
talks on the Gaza-Jericho First plan. Tomorrow night, the 
Israeli delegations to the Washington peace talks are to fly to 
the American capital for the resumption of those negotiations on 
Tuesday [15 February]. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says Syria has not softened 
its demand for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights. On the Palestinian track, Peres says he continues to 
oppose a Palestinian state, and prefers a Palestinian-Jordanian 
confederation. 
  A senior Foreign Ministry official says PLO Chairman 'Arafat 
spoke bitterly of Jordan King Husayn in Cairo last week, and 
there is concern that the establishment of a Palestinian state 
will bring about a civil war. David Ze'ev reports: 
  The Israeli officials say the resumption of the negotiations 
in Taba between Israel and the PLO can be divided into two 
categories: issues that were agreed upon in principle in Cairo, 
that must now be finalized; and other matters less dramatic, 
which nevertheless must be resolved. The Cairo issues that must 
be worked out in greater detail include the administrative 
running of border crossings and joint patrols on roads in the 
area. [passage omitted] 
  A senior diplomatic official says Israel is inclined to try 
to ease the pressure on the Palestinians, saying there is no 
point, for example, in pressing the PLO to abolish the clauses 
in its charter calling for the destruction of Israel. The 
senior official said the Palestine National Council, which must 
take the step, is inoperative, and Chairman 'Arafat certainly 
does not have a two-thirds majority in the council, as required, 
to make the changes. [Jerusalem Israel Television Network 
Channel 1 in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 13 February reports that 
speaking at the 13 February cabinet meeting, the foreign 
minister warned that 'Arafat must not be weakened too much, lest 
we render him unable to control Gaza and Jericho 
satisfactorily."] 
  As Israel's teams to the Washington peace talks prepare to 
set out for the American capital, Foreign Minister Peres has 
repeated that there will be no progress with Syria as long as 
Damascus refuses to raise the level of the talks. A high-level 
Foreign Ministry official says Jerusalem has complained to the 
Americans that when the Syrians say a comprehensive peace, they 
really mean a comprehensive price for Israel to pay. 
  Israeli and Jordanian negotiators were in touch directly in 
advance of their talks. Chief Israeli negotiator Elyaqim 
Rubinstein says the scope of those negotiations is widening. In 
the Foreign Ministry they would not comment on whether Jordan 
might sign a peace agreement with Israel once a final agreement 
is reached with the Palestinians on the Gaza-Jericho First plan.

  [Text] The OIC [Islamic Conference Organization, ICO] 
secretary general, Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid, has appealed to all 
Afghan leaders, parties, commanders and people to cease all 
hostilities and scrupulously observe a cease-fire on all fronts 
from the first of Ramadan al-Mubarak [Holy Ramadan]. Dr. Hamid 
al-Ghabid, now in Pakistan, renewed the offer of the OIC to 
assist and facilitate a political process in Afghanistan. He 
said the OIC is prepared to play a meaningful role in promoting 
an intra-Afghan peace process without precondition. However, he 
said effective cessation of hostilities and observance of 
cease-fire are essential to enable the organization, and friends 
of Afghanistan, to help Afghan brothers overcome this tragic 
phase. 
  The OIC Secretary General Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid had a meeting 
with the president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, in 
Islamabad today. They discussed the major issues of concern to 
the OIC including Kashmir and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Dr. Hamid 
al-Ghabid also had a meeting with the NWFP [North West Frontier 
Province] Governor Major General Retired Khurshid Ali Khan in 
Peshawar, and discussed with him matters relating to the affairs 
of Muslim ummah [community] as well as of bilateral interests.

  [Text] Colombo, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Sri Lanka's Prime Minister 
Ranil Wickremasinghe Monday rejected peace overtures from a 
junior rebel and insisted that any serious offer to end the 
bloodshed must come from the Tamil Tiger chieftain. 
  A local leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE) 
had asked the Colombo government last week to "create conditions 
to establishing peace" in the embattled northeast where the 
rebels are fighting for a separate state. 
  In the first reaction to the offer made by an LTTE 
functionary known as Karikalan, the prime minister said that 
rebel supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran, 39, must be directly 
involved in any new peace effort. 
  "Any response from the LTTE must come from Prabhakaran. We 
have not closed the door for peace. But Prabhakaran is silent," 
Wickremasinghe told a public rally in central Kotmale region 
Sunday. 
  He said 14 months of talks with the LTTE ended in failure in 
June 1990, leading to more bloodshed, and he added that after 
that debacle all political parties agreed that Prabhakaran must 
be directly involved with any talks. 
  "No political party has changed that position. We do not 
want 
to discourage anyone from talking. But any serious move must 
come from Prabhakaran himself and no one else in the LTTE," 
Wickremasinghe told AFP Monday. 
  The latest LTTE peace bid was conveyed to the government by 
A.T. Ariyaratna, a leader of a non-governmental organisation, 
who visited LTTE-held Jaffna Peninsula. 
  "I met the (LTTE's Jaffna political leader) Karikalan who 
expressed their desire to bring about peace. I have conveyed 
their message to the president," said Ariyaratna who heads the 
voluntary organisation called Sarvodaya. 
  He said Karikalan's message in Tamil was tape recorded and a 
transcript was given to President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga who 
has often repeated that there was no ethnic conflict but a 
problem of terrorism in the island's north. 
  "I only conveyed to the president (this message) and he said 
he will give very serious thought to all that and for me to 
continue what ever confidence building measures," Ariyaratna 
said. 
  The Tigers had asked the government to create conditions 
conducive to peace by dismantling a limited economic blockade on 
the peninsula. There have been no concrete proposals from the 
Tigers themselves. 
  Ariyaratna, a member of the majority Sinhalese community, 
said he was planning several more visits to the Jaffna peninsula 
to "build confidence" between Sinhalese and the minority Tamils 
concentrated in the northeast. 
  The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Colombo Nicholas Marcus 
Fernando and the Anglican Bishop of Colombo Kenneth Fernando 
made separate visits to Jaffna recently and reiterated the need 
for ending the 22-year-old war. 
  The two clergymen also met with several LTTE leaders, 
although the Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabakaran did not make an 
appearance. 
  Wickremasinghe also said the government hoped that the 
LTTE's 
political wing, known as the People's Front of Liberation Tigers 
(PFLT), would contest local council elections in parts of the 
embattled northeast. 
  "We wanted to give them a chance to test their popularity 
and 
then come for talks. But they have not responded," 
Wickremasinghe said. The elections are scheduled for March 1. 
  Security forces, who have been acquiring more hardware and 
men in recent months, are currently conducting limited 
operations against LTTE positions in the island's east ahead of 
the local election.

  [Text] Iran's President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani in his 
address to the millions strong gathering of the people at Azadi 
Square said that such a gathering showed that the insinuations 
by the enemies of the revolution were of no use. 
  "The extensive presence of the people here is a clear proof 
that the Islamic ummah (nation) is unwilling to ignore the 
reality of their own lives under the influence of the 
negativistic and discouraging whispers of the enemies," he told 
the crowd. 
  He said that the drop in oil prices was meant as measure to 
deal a severe blow to the Islamic republic. "The global 
arrogance, by creating the grounds for the drop in oil prices 
tried to hurt the Islamic Iran but did not succeed," he said, 
"today we produce the necessary raw material for our factories 
and foreign specialists (formerly in Iran) have been replaced 
with our own specialists." 
  He added that today Iranian universities were meeting the 
needs of the univeristy students and that in the field of 
telecommunications Iran was depending more and more on the 
indigenous human and technical resources. 
  He said that Iran was reaching the stage of self-sufficiency 
in the area of providing foodstuffs. "The farmers, the 
ranchers, the poultrymen and the fishermen of the Islamic Iran 
have all been able to meet the nutritional needs of the people 
to a great extent," he said. 
  Elsewhere in his speech Rafsanjani discussed the legacy of 
Imam Khomeyni, saying that the legacy of imam served as a 
blueprint for the success of the revolution in Iran. "The 
nation of Iran is determined to follow the path of our late imam 
and will do so with ever-increasing resoluteness," he said.

  [Text] His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the honorable 
leader of the Islamic revolution and the guardian of the cause 
of Muslims, today in a decree appointed Dr. 'Ali Larijani, the 
minister of culture and Islamic guidance, as the head of the 
Voice and Vision Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and as a member of the Supreme Council of the Cultural 
Revolution for a term of five years. The full text of the 
eminent leader's decree is as follows: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Now 
that through divine blessing the people of Iran are celebrating 
the 15th anniversary of the glorious revolution with pride and a 
sense of victory; now that the people and the government -- 
united and steadfast -- have surpassed a long, adventurous march 
full of victories as well as difficulties; now that the serving 
government, through a great struggle and by taking the 
initiative, has removed the major obstacles in the face of 
economic progress and national growth and development -- thereby 
paving the way toward construction and general welfare with a 
speed suited to the conditions of the revolution, the general 
conditions of the country require the publicity mechanism of the 
Voice and Vision to take on new policies in line with the 
nation's progress in all fields in order to balance the cultural 
climate of the nation and the accelerating trend of construction 
and general growth and development with the bases of the 
revolution and the fundamental principles of Islam. Furthermore, 
in order to confront the propaganda and cultural onslaught of 
arrogance and its lackeys, the new policies should widen the 
scope of the media's struggle in the trench of explaining, 
deepening, and honoring the glorious principles of the Islamic 
revolution, as well as in the trench of explaining the 
self-sacrificing efforts of the country's officials, the three 
branches of the state, judiciary, executive, legislative, 
especially the hard working and relentless judicial branch, with 
new, progressive, and rational methods and through a great and 
vigilant jihad. 
  Taking into account the aforementioned, and expressing my 
thanks and gratitude for the relentless and continuous efforts 
of the esteemed Mohammad Hashemi, who during his term as the 
official in charge of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran -- particularly during the imposed Iran-Iraq 
war -- carried out great and all-encompassing efforts in 
administrating this sensitive and important institution, I 
appoint the esteemed Dr. 'Ali Larijani, who is one of the 
outstanding scientific and cultural figures of the country and 
who has a proud, revolutionary background, as well as a 
background of cabinet responsibilities -- and an individual 
known for his devotion, piety, and cultural and artistic 
experiences -- as the head of the Voice and Vision, as well as a 
member of the Supreme Council for Cultural Revolution for a term 
of five years. 
  It is expected that he will receive the cooperation of 
intelligent colleagues and revolutionary innovators from within 
the organization and attract prominent personalities from 
outside to produce a new plan and a productive agenda to utilize 
the organization's vast resources, turn it into a base for the 
development of ideas, culture, and art, and a center for the 
guidance of Iran's Muslim people and others who are eager to 
hear the voice of revolutionary Iran. A place for the 
presentation of the nation's achievements in different fields of 
life, science, politics, art, education, and other fields. 
  Here I deem it necessary to thank the esteemed Supervisory 
Council of the IRIB, comprising representatives from the three 
powers of judicial, legislative, and executive for their 
valuable efforts, and while wishing its scholarly and worthy 
members to cooperate with the management of the Voice and 
Vision, announce the termination of the Council. 
  The salient points, which should be observed in the great 
new 
plan are as follows: 
  The operation of the Voice and Vision organization should be 
aimed at achieving better quality in all its programs. The 
quantitative expansion should be put in second place. 
Nevertheless, the necessary nationwide transmission to all 
corners and rural areas of the country should be given priority. 
  The structure of the organization should be reviewed and the 
necessary changes should be made to its style and productivity. 
  Cooperation with university scholars and scholastic circles 
should be used to raise scientific and social issues and present 
new ideas to the public. 
  In Islamic discussions, attention should be paid to the 
quality, depth, and excellence of the issues. Weak and 
ambiguous issues and personal tastes should be avoided. In 
order to achieve this, wise and calculated cooperation should be 
made with religious seminaries and scholars, particularly the 
esteemed and prominent scholars of the Qom Seminary. 
  In general, Voice and Vision should become an open school 
for 
the presentation of the realities of pure Muhammadan Islam, 
peace be upon him and his scion, and the instructions of the Ahl 
al-Beit [family of the prophet], peace be upon them, in a noble 
and proper way. 
  In the production of artistic programs, cooperation should 
be 
made with the country's cultural foundations, such as the 
Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the Islamic publicity 
organization, and artistic circles, in order to make the most 
use of them. 
  The dissemination of information, which is one of the most 
important tasks of the Voice and Vision, should find a better 
system, better speed, better editorial judgement, as well as 
intelligible and correct language, more than before. The Voice 
and Vision must use correct Persian, and its language should set 
standards. Mispronunciation and misreading must be eliminated 
immediately. The Voice and Vision must be the teacher of the 
sweet, clear, and powerful Persian language. A number of steps 
have been taken in his context, but they should be complemented. 
  Artistic programs on the Voice and Vision should become 
sweet and attractive, with the most sumptuous theatrical arts 
containing social, political, and ethical messages in this 
all-encompassing medium. Light, empty, and misleading programs 
lacking in artistic quality, which are sometimes very expensive 
to produce, must be banned forthwith. 
  The broadcast of banal and sensual music, especially those 
types of music that in this branch of the arts lack national 
identity and Iranian principles, must be avoided. Music can be 
both permitted [halal] and banned [haram]. Its permitted type 
should be recognized and used correctly following the clear 
instructions of the late Imam [Khomeyni], sanctified be his 
dust. Genuine Iranian arts, which suit the spiritual make up 
and instincts of our people, should be used more in this context. 
  In all the programs, the general trend should be toward 
confronting the propaganda, cultural and news onslaught of 
arrogance. This important principle must be adhered to not only 
in news and reports, but also in scientific, social, and 
political programs -- especially in artistic and entertaining 
programs such as plays, one-off dramas, and serials. This point 
should be correctly clarified to all the employees of radio and 
television. The alien, attacking culture affects the mind and 
actions of the people more through plays and entertaining 
programs than through face-to-face talks. This unwanted effect 
must be vigilantly and rationally stopped. 
  On the whole, the Voice and Vision, as the great late Imam, 
may he be admitted to God's paradise, had highlighted, should be 
a university for all in which religion, ethics, Islamic values, 
and the ways and methods of life, as well as new developments in 
the world of science and politics -- and new and pioneering 
thoughts -- are taught in a clear language comprehensible to all 
sectors of society, so that every one, from those with simple 
minds to great thinkers and outstanding individuals, can manage 
to benefit from the radio and television programs to the best of 
their ability, and so that everyone can become fulfilled by the 
programs' great bounty. 
  Programs must be understandable and useful for all people, 
but must not, in any way, be banal and frivolous. A Voice and 
Vision suitable for Islamic Iran should gradually take shape in 
which intelligence, ability, and a general leaning toward 
culture, politics, and science exists side by side with 
subtlety, taste, and talent, and be accompanied by a spirit of 
reconstruction and recreation of a great and proud Iran, natural 
to this ancient, yet young nation. 
  Apart from all that, the share of listeners beyond the 
borders -- millions of people who in various states and from 
various nations have set their sights to Iran and the voice of 
the Islamic revolution -- should be prominently considered. 
External programs should be completely free from banality, 
repetitiveness, and frivolity and truly depict the Islamic Iran. 
The carrying out of this heavy duty -- some of whose 
preliminaries have been prepared by the former hardworking 
management and officials, and some other sections of which must 
be prepared by the current wise and intellectual manager -- no 
doubt requires the cooperation of all the connected 
establishments, especially the cabinet and the Islamic 
Consultative Majles. 
  I call upon the respected deputies of the Islamic 
Consultative Majles and respected cabinet members, especially 
the president who is a man of knowledge and is an expert in 
Islamic lore, to offer any assistance regarding the budget and 
other resources for the move that the Voice and Vision needs 
today. I expect the scholars, experts, artists, and other 
strata, which are capable of somehow getting this crucial 
organization to its deserved place, to cooperate with its 
management. Undoubtedly such progress cannot be achieved 
overnight. The important thing is that such a direction is 
pursued. I beseech God Almighty success and guidance for the 
respected head of the organization and the others involved, and 
hope that all come under the auspices of the pure prayers of 
God's supreme deputy [Vali al-Allah al-'Azam], may our souls be 
sacrificed for him, and the assistance of that great one. 
  Peace be upon all the believing brothers. 
  [Signed] Sayyed Ali Khamene'i

  [Text] Kuwait City, Feb 13 (AFP) -- The Kuwaiti cabinet 
will resign in mid-March and a new government will be formed, 
the Monday edition of AL-SIYASAH daily reported, adding that the 
country's leaders wanted to strengthen the executive. 
  The paper, citing informed sources, said the resignation 
would occur after 'Id al-Fitr, the feast marking the end of the 
Moslem holy fasting month of Ramadan which began February 11 in 
Kuwait. 
  Senior Kuwaiti officials want to "bolster the executive 
branch by unifying positions and speeding up the decision-making 
process," the paper said. 
  AL-SIYASAH said the current government had accomplished its 
mission by reviving the 1962 constitution and parliamentary life. 
  The outgoing 15-member cabinet was formed in October 1992 
and 
is led by the crown prince, Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdallah al-Sabah. 
Six ministers are independent MPs or opposition members. 
  The key portfolios -- foreign affairs, interior, defense and 
information -- are held by members of the ruling Al-Sabah family. 
  The opposition swept the legislative elections of October 5, 
1992 leading the previous cabinet to resign two days later.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Feb (MENA)--The Arab Labor Organization 
[ALO] has prepared a draft Palestinian labor law that has been 
revised by a joint committee made up of experts from the ALO and 
the PLO, which requested the law. 
  Announcing this, ALO Director General Bakr Muhammad Rasul 
said the draft law was based on the main principles stipulated 
in Arab and international labor standards, taking into 
consideration the Palestinian people's general circumstances and 
the establishment of a Palestinian state. 
  He explained that the Palestinian draft law has 11 sections. 
Each section contains several chapters and articles about 
idioms, definitions, and general rules on employment, individual 
work contracts, working and rest hours, leaves, wages, 
juvenile's and women's labor, settling collective labor 
disputes, collective negotiations, collective work contracts, 
and inspection.

  [Excerpt] Tunis -- President Yasir 'Arafat has disclosed 
the formation of a "regional order" in the region comprising 
Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. However, he emphasized 
that Riyadh is wavering in joining this order because it 
excludes Syria from any regional arrangements in the region. 
  President 'Arafat proposed that a 
Jordanian-Palestinian-Syrian bloc be formed to impose itself on 
this order whose foundations were established during recent 
visits to Turkey by Israeli President 'Ezer Weizman and Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak. 
  'Arafat made this disclosure at his meeting with King Husayn 
during his short visit to Amman on 10 February after signing the 
Cairo agreement with Israel. 
  President 'Arafat asked King Husayn to exert his efforts in 
mediating between the PLO and Syria with the aim of rebuilding 
the bridges of confidence between Damascus and the PLO. A 
senior Palestinian official who participated in the 
Jordanian-Palestinian summit talks has stressed that steps have 
been taken toward Palestinian-Syrian reconciliation. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Rashid Khashanah: "Fatah and the People's Party </F>
Form Joint `Higher Committee'"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- Fatah and the Palestinian People's Party 
[PPP] (formerly the Communist Party) have decided to form a 
higher coordination committee consisting of three 
representatives from each side "to coordinate political 
positions and discuss developments with a view to maintaining a 
united position on such developments and ways of dealing with 
them, and to tackle issues referred to it by other coordination 
committees." 
  At the conclusion of meetings held resulting in a "joint 
program" between them, Fatah and the PPP decided to form "field 
coordination committees to pursue joint cooperation and act as 
joint authorities working for the development of relations, 
cooperation, and settlement of any problems which might arise." 
The first such committee will be in Jerusalem, the second in 
Gaza, and the third in Tunis. 
  The latest edition of the Fatah bulletin issued by Fatah's 
Central Committee in Tunis said that the cooperation program 
with the PPP is in the context of the "dialogue with the vital 
and effective forces to consolidate national unity, contain 
attempts to impose division and fragmentation, and close the 
door in the face of the advocates of sedition and infighting." 
It likened it to the agreement concluded "between the cadres of 
Fatah and the Hamas fighters" which had a good effect in 
preventing sedition and in providing more scope for dialogue and 
democracy which respects the right to disagree. 
  The 11-point cooperation program, the text of which it 
published, stressed that the Declaration of Principles "is an 
instrument of struggle to which we respond to the degree it 
helps in the implementation of all parts and provisions of 
Security Council Resolution 242 in a manner that would ensure 
full withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian territories." 
  Fatah and the PPP emphasized that the Palestinian National 
Authority approved by the Palestine Central Council in its 
session last October should be considered as the authority 
"responsible for all aspects of the Palestinian people's life in 
the areas from which the occupation forces withdraw...and its 
powers should be extended to include the rest of the West Bank 
including Jerusalem." 
  The two sides said that the criteria of the economic 
negotiating plan should be based "on economic independence, 
self-reliance, and Arab integration, and that progress in these 
negotiations should be made conditional on progress in the 
political negotiations." 
  Fatah and the PPP underscored the "democratic nature of the 
Palestinian National Authority and its respect for human rights, 
plurality, and the principle of free democratic elections as the 
basis of legislative and executive authority resulting from 
political and legislative general elections."

<F P=106> [From Michael Jansen in Damascus] </F>
  [Text] In an interview, Dr. George Habash, leader of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), told this 
correspondent why he rejected not only the Cairo Agreement on 
security arrangements for the Palestinian self-rule area 
concluded on Feb. 9 but also the declaration of principles 
negotiated in Oslo. 
  The interview took place at his office in an elegant old 
house in a quiet, residential quarter of this city. Dr. Habash, 
well recovered from three serious strokes and sporting a 
cheerful burgundy red cardigan, spoke in both Arabic and English. 
  The Cairo accord, which gives Israel full control of the 
border crossings from Jordan and Egypt into the West Bank and 
Gaza and full control of access roads to Jewish settlements with 
the right to pursuit of Palestinian militants continuing their 
resistance to the occupation, amounts to a "retreat for the 
PLO", Dr. Habash stated, a "retreat" from its own longterm 
policy of striving to secure "national rights, 
self-determination, independence and the right of return" for 
the Palestinian people. "The majority of Palestinians now 
oppose" Mr. 'Arafat's policies, "including members of Fatah 
closest to" him. 
  Dr. Habash's assessment of the Cairo agreement would seem to 
be correct because on Feb. 10, the morning after it was signed, 
a commentator on Israeli Radio said that Israel's main reason 
for retaining control of the border crossings was to prevent 
Palestinian expelees from exercising their right to return to 
their homeland. 
  Mr. 'Arafat, he stated, "was being pushed by all the major 
blocs and powers--Europe, the U.S., Japan--to offer more and 
more concessions to achieve implementation" of the Oslo accord, 
the signing of which led to the resignation of the PFLP from the 
PLO Executive Committee. He was particularly critical of 
Egyptian President, Husni Mubarak, who has been pressing the PLO 
to make these harmful concessions, and the U.S. which, he said, 
were acting "in their own interests" and not those of the 
Palestinian people. 
  "'Arafat," Dr. Habash asserted, "had no chance to make gains 
(for the Palestinian people) but could only make concessions... 
all the world accepts Israel and all the world, except Israel, 
accepts the right of the Palestinian people to 
self-determination" but the pressure for concessions is on the 
Palestinians not on Israel. 
  The Oslo accord, he went on, was seriously flawed because 
"all the substantive issues--Jerusalem, fixing borders, the 
Palestinian right of return, Israeli settlements--have been 
postponed until the last minute. How long will it take to reach 
agreement on these major issues when it takes so long to agree 
on trivial issues." 
  "Even if (the Oslo accord) were to be implemented easily, it 
would never solve our Palestinian problem" because it "will 
never bring a just and comprehensive peace... We used to tell 
'Arafat before he signed that agreement that he had to take 
certain steps before signing. First, adopt a policy based on 
implementation of the international legitimacy, by this I mean 
the U.N. resolutions" on Palestine calling for "Israeli 
withdrawal, recognition of Palestinian rights to repatriation 
and compensation and so on. Second, work for Arab unity and 
coordination, especially with Syria. Third, forge Palestinianian 
unity and fourth, escalate the intifadah... to force Israel to 
settle." 
  These steps, particularly his insistance on Arab unity, have 
been part and parcel of Dr. Habash's strategy since he was head 
of the arab nationalist movement more than 30 years ago. 
  Dr. Habash believed the Oslo accord would be undermined in 
three ways; "the intrasigence of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin; the Likud taking power (latest polls show that it would 
win an election) and development of the rejectionist camp," now 
comprising ten groups based in Damascus and the occupied 
territories. The main aim of this alliance is to "revitalise 
the intifadah," restoring it to the high intensity of 1988-89, 
concentrating on the Israeli economy when Israel suffered losses 
of $3 billion. I regret to say, and I mean this, without the 
armed struggle harming the Israeli economy, causing the Israeli 
army physical losses, Israel will never respond to our demands." 
He concluded by saying that no member of the alliance would 
take part in elections to the self-governing authority scheduled 
in July. 
  At the PFLP's office in the al-Yarmuk quarter which was once 
a Palestinian refugee camp, Talal Ahmad, the official in charge 
of information, stated that the rejection front, the "Alliance 
of Palestinian Forces," was doing its "best to isolate 'Arafat" 
and promote "democratic decision-making." 
  Mr. Ahmad said that the alliance had established an 
executive 
committee made up of one member from each group and had decided 
to "reestalish a unified national command" for the intifadah and 
set up a 100-member central council, comparable to that of the 
PLO, consisting of two representatives from each group and 
independents. Although each group would "act on its own" in the 
resistance, this was "the first time we have been able to 
establish such a broad coalition... previously Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad refused" to cooperate with the secularists, he stated. 
  As long as the present confrontation between Palestinians 
and 
Israelis continues, the rejectionist forces would be able to 
operate as usual in the territories, but, Mr. Ahmad asserted, 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord would "complicate" the 
struggle because the Palestinian police would be a barrier 
between the intifadah and the Israelis." This would require a 
"new strategy" which was being developed. 
  He was not worried about the possibility that the Syrians 
would curb the activities of the "alliance." 
  "They will keep us until the last moment" to maintain 
pressure on Israel. "In any case," he went on, "we're 
transferring our operational bases to the territories. We have 
only our political and information offices here... our 
effectiveness is not dependent on Syria,"--a point made 
forcefully by the killing of two Israelis on 10 February by 
Islamic Jihad and the killing of a member of an Israeli 
undercover death squad by Hamas on Sunday.

  [Text] Salah Salah, a member of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] Political Bureau, has said that 
under the proposed peace agreement the Palestinians are being 
denied the right to repatriation. He stressed the need for 
dialogue between the Palestinians and Lebanon regarding both 
side's refusal to accept permanent settlement of Palestinians in 
Lebanon. 
  Criticizing the Lebanese Government, he said it wants to 
dismantle, not rebuild, the Palestinian camps and wants to drive 
the Palestinians to integrate into society so that the 
population of the camps will lose their cohesiveness. He noted 
that this policy furthers the permanent settlement of 
Palestinians in Lebanon. 
  In an interview with the Voice of the Mountain, Salah called 
for expanding the current camps or building new ones. He 
praised the great understanding shown by Minister Junblatt on 
Palestinian civil rights. He said the Palestinian issue will be 
discussed with Prime Minister al-Hariri soon and urged the labor 
minister to help resolve the problem of Palestinian employment 
in Lebanon.

  [Excerpts] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Hizballah has commemorated 
the second anniversary of the assassination of its Secretary 
General 'Abbas al-Musawi and the 10th anniversary of the death 
of Shaykh Raghib Harb. It held a speech rally in Bi'r Hasan 
attended by an Islamic Republic of Iran delegation represented 
by its ambassadors to Lebanon and Syria Homayun 'Ali Zadeh and 
Mohammad Akhtari-Forughi, and by Lebanese and Palestinian 
deputies and religious, military, and partisan figures, and 
others. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the "Islamic 
Jihad 
Movement in Palestine," made a speech in which he said that the 
"resistance men insist on defeating Israel." He criticized 
those "who drink toasts with murderers and who speak of future 
normalization." [passage omitted] 
  At the end, Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah 
spoke. He said that "the resistance, whose leaders they killed 
in order to destroy it, is now stronger, firmer, and more 
solid." He reaffirmed that "our firm choice and absolute 
conviction is that the resistance is the only way to regain the 
territories and the holy places and to make real and precious 
peace. We will complete that journey most strongly and will not 
be deterred by Zionist terrorist methods or the continuous 
threats of a new war or annihilation of Hizballah...." 
  He asked "is it not time for everyone to give up their bet 
on 
negotiations which can only produce an Israeli peace on Israeli 
terms?" He criticized the United States for reneging on the 
commitments announced at the Geneva summit, and he also 
criticized the "Gaza-Jericho First" and Cairo agreements. He 
charged that Israel "has not abandoned the option of separate 
solutions so that it would move quickly to impose its terms on 
the Palestinian side with the presence of a traitor like 
(Palestinian President) Yasir 'Arafat who is making endless 
concessions." 
  He urged "the Palestinian people to intensify their 
revolution and uprising and to work seriously for the downfall 
of the treasonous Zionized leadership of which 'Arafat is the 
black symbol, and even to destroy it and, by doing so, abort all 
the humiliating agreements." 
  He called on all the peoples of the region to "uphold the 
great resistance option in order to put an end to the 
occupation, especially in Lebanon." He appealed to "all the 
Lebanese to join the ranks of the resistance." He thanked Iran 
and Syria for their positions and criticized the "Lebanese 
Government and the official silence" about what is taking place 
in the south. He said: "That government is the biggest 
absentee in relation to all national issues." He added: "Did 
you not notice the great official interest shown in the incident 
of the execution of the murderer who had committed his 
abominable crime in Ba'labakk (Husayn 'Awwadah) carried out by 
agreement among the families concerned which adhered to a known 
Shari'ah rule and carried it out immediately to prevent 
sedition, at a time when there was terrible official silence 
about the horrible Israeli aggressions in the south and in 
western al-Biqa'? Is that government performance not considered 
to be an encouragement and a complementary factor to the 
aggression?" 
  He criticized the way the government addresses the 
steadfastness of the southerners and the economic and social 
issues as well as the issue of the return of the evacuees. He 
also criticized it for "keeping in flux the investigation into 
the 13 September massacre" (the al-Ghubayri incident) and he 
challenged the government to hold a referendum to determine its 
popularity.

  [Excerpts] A new Palestinian publication in English -- THE 
JERUSALEM TIMES -- appeared last weekend. The newspaper adopted 
a moderate line and is a champion of the peace process. Our 
correspondent in the territories 'Amir Hay visited newspaper 
location: 
  The first issue of THE JERUSALEM TIMES in English was first 
disseminated in the territories over the weekend. The weekly 
consists of 16 pages, in which the reader will find reports, 
articles, and commentaries on current affairs, with an emphasis 
on the political process. The publication is designed to become 
a daily within a short time. In the first issue, editor Hanna 
Sinyurah, who is currently in Spain, chose to emphasize the 
details of the Cairo agreement. 
  On our visit to the weekly's East Jerusalem offices today, 
we 
were told by several staff members that the publication aims to 
boost grass roots support for the political process. [passage 
omitted] 
  One of the things the reader will not find in the new weekly 
is, for instance, criticism of 'Arafat's performance in the 
negotiations with Israel -- criticism which became more 
clamorous in the wake of the Davos summit and the Cairo 
agreement, and which has been voiced in the two old-time 
dailies, AL-NAHAR and AL-QUDS. 
  Editors of the new weekly say it is financed by commercial 
advertisements, with the PLO extending only ideological support. 
'Arafat's opponents say he has prepared himself a new unfledged 
newspaper that will give him unreserved support after the 
implementation of self-rule.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] It is regrettable that some of our Palestinian 
brothers think that politics and oratory are one and the same 
thing. Given that oratory is ever capable of working miracles 
in a dream world, this section of our Palestinian community 
seems to judge any political action that falls short of set 
objectives or does not end up fulfilling aspirations in one fell 
swoop to be absolutely conspiratorial and capitulationist. For 
them, political action consists mainly in rhetoric that sets out 
their objectives. 
  We had believed that the last few years saw us, 
Palestinians, 
cast off this one-dimensional, starry-eyed approach, when we 
began to talk in terms of political thought, political 
education, a phased struggle, and the need to pursue our main 
objectives in stages each requiring a certain shape of struggle 
and a language suited to changing circumstances. We must now 
admit that we have been proved wrong. Nearly 14 years since the 
first and oft-discredited rejectionist experience of the 
Palestinians, here we are again experiencing the same verbal 
negative experience. This is not to say that we have anything 
against the right to dissent and rejection. Indeed, this is a 
sacred right that should not be undermined as long as it is 
exercised to advance [words indistinct]. We ourselves are now 
exercising this very right. Our sole aim is to correct the 
course of the militant march and safeguard the Palestinian 
household and strengthen the foundation of Palestinian unity. 
It is just an attempt we are making from this forum to caution 
against the risks inherent in the rejectionist rhetoric that 
never advances beyond lip service. Indeed, these naysayers say 
nothing of merit, aside from pointing accusing fingers and 
raising doubts. They also fail to recognize new facts and their 
implications for the Palestinians and Arabs, and globally. Far 
from leading to a grasp of new facts and how to handle them, 
such an approach inevitably leads us away from hard realities. 
Those who point accusing fingers and pass ready-made judgments, 
in effect, gradually close the doors before a national dialogue 
and promote discord and consequently jeopardize our national 
unity. The naysayers even do not view stepped up struggle 
against occupation and forcing new facts on the ground as the 
road to topple the declaration of principles agreement. For 
them, the only means to topple the agreement is to topple 
Palestinian legitimacy and the historic leadership of the 
Palestinians. In other words, the rejectionists are not coming 
up with any plan of action to dislodge occupation. They have 
nothing to offer save the same revolutionary statements and 
slogans they have raised over the past 20 years. Thus, instead 
of proposing national action to upgrade the revolution and 
resistance, they are seeking the aggrandizement of factional 
interests that, if allowed to grow and take hold, carry dire 
consequences for the militant march of our people. [words 
indistinct] Are our people's national interests and objectives 
thus served? We hope this question will be weighed before it is 
too late.

  [Text] Vienna, Feb 10, IRNA -- OPEC conference president 
and Qatar energy and industry minister, 'Abdallah Bin-Hamad 
al-'Attiyah, called on the organization to consider, at its next 
ministerial meeting in Geneva on March 25, a five to ten per 
cent cut in output aimed at boosting oil prices, according to an 
OPEC source here Thursday [10 February]. In an interview with 
IRNA the source added that the decision was taken at a meeting 
between al-'Attiyah and the visiting Nigerian Petroleum and 
Mineral Resources Secretary Chief Don Obot Etiebet in Doha on 
Wednesday. Etiebet is on a tour of OPEC member countries to 
shore up support for production cut and price boost. 
  Without the cooperation of OPEC member countries in cutting 
production a price hike would be impossible, said the source. 
  So far Russia, Yemen and Syria have announced their 
readiness 
to cooperate with OPEC, but Britain and Norway, two major 
suppliers of crude have refused to negotiate and cooperate with 
OPEC, noted the same source. The price of OPEC basket of seven 
crudes stood at dlrs 13.36 a barrel Wednesday, compared with 
dlrs 13.39 the previous day.

  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Iran is attempting to 
mobilize the Japanese Red Army and Islamic guerrilla groups for 
joint assassination missions and other terrorist acts in the 
United States and Europe, a pro-Jordanian daily in Jerusalem 
reported Sunday. 
  The Red Army and several Islamic guerrilla groups met 
several 
weeks ago at the Teheran headquarters of the Iranian 
intelligence service, the Arab-language AN-NAHAR said quoting 
intelligence organs in several European countries. 
  The dispatch from Paris said Iran is hoping to disrupt the 
Middle East peace talks because it fears isolation should they 
be successful. 
  Tehran also appears to believe that one aim of the talks 
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
is to destabilize Iran, according to the paper. 
  The Islamic groups attending the meeting included Hizbollah, 
a Lebanon-based militant Shiite faction, and the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, an extremist 
group operating outside the PLO, the report said. 
  The meeting was also attended by high-ranking officials from 
the Iranian intelligence service and Iran's revolution guard 
corps, the report said. 
  The paper said Iran's revolution guard corps has trained the 
Japanese Red Army in Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and the Iranian 
Embassy in Beirut has helped Red Army members travel between 
Iran and Lebanon. 
  The Red Army, formed in 1971, was responsible for a series 
of 
hijacking and armed attacks in the 1970s, including the 1972 
massacre at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv.

  [Text] Foreign ambassadors and representatives of foreign 
diplomatic missions and international organizations in Iran 
today were received by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Our 
reporter sent us this report: 
  [Unidentified reporter] During the meeting, the president 
said that the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
based on strengthening friendship and cooperation and the 
establishment of friendly relations with all countries, with the 
exception of the regime occupying Jerusalem and America. He 
said: We are strongly against regional crises and wars, and we 
are prepared to cooperate with international organizations and 
peace loving nations of the world in order to eliminate centers 
of crisis. 
  Condemning America's hostile policy toward Iran, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: America has never been able to 
comprehend the realities of the Islamic revolution of Iran and 
is still living in the past when she regarded herself the master 
of this country. Therefore, the Iranian people will confront 
America's hostile policies with firmness and strength and will 
never compromise with that kind of thinking. 
  He described the regime occupying Jerusalem as an 
illegitimate and imposed regime and added: Israel is not 
seeking a peace that guarantees the legitimate rights of the 
oppressed Palestinian people. One cannot support the so-called 
peace talks as long as the destiny of millions of Palestinian 
refugees is not clarified. 
  The president described the victory of the Islamic 
revolution 
of Iran in 1979 as being due to the justice seeking and 
antityrannical attitude of the Iranian people. He said: If we 
are witnessing the deterioration of values and principles and of 
human and international norms in many parts of the world today, 
this is due to deviations from the pure and peace loving nature 
of the nations of the world. 
  Enumerating examples of corruption and injustice during the 
era of Iran's former lackey regime, its collusion with unjust 
international policies, and its dependent foreign policy, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: All members of Iranian society--with 
unprecedented unity and through reliance upon the call of their 
spiritual nature [fetrat] and by following the wise leadership 
of their religious leader--rose up against tyranny and 
injustice. They have paid a very heavy price thus far in order 
to achieve victory and to safeguard their gains. They are also 
prepared to continue paying the price of their independence and 
freedom in the future. 
  Referring to the progress made by the Islamic Republic of 
Iran during the era of reconstruction, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: 
A serious effort is continuing in Iran to reconstruct and repair 
all of the losses inflicted and the backwardness. The most 
important engineering projects and basic measures--including 
roads, power generators, ports, transportation, railways, the 
discovery and transfer of oil and gas, and agriculture--are 
being implemented with great speed by the hands of domestic 
experts and by using domestic equipment and material. Great 
success has already been achieved in these fields. 
  Referring to regional and international crises, especially 
the bitter and painful events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
president criticized the positions of international 
organizations. He said: Despite the readiness of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to send 10,000 peacekeeping forces to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, this offer was rejected with the excuse of 
maintaining impartiality. At the moment, the Serbs are free to 
commit any crime, and the world stops at only condemning these 
crimes. 
  He stressed: The required seriousness toward defending 
oppressed peoples does not exist in the centers of power in the 
world. One should expect all the governments and nations to 
hold hands and to prevent so much tyranny and injustice. 
  Addressing the foreign ambassadors, diplomatic 
representatives, and delegations from international 
organizations based in Iran, Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed: I ask 
you--as representatives who live in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and witness our people's political and cultural maturity, as 
well as our country's development and progress--to fulfill what 
we expect from you. I ask you to convey the realities to the 
people of your respective countries, thereby making the world 
public aware of these realities. In this way, the foundations 
for establishing international and regional peace and stability 
will be laid down. 
  The president then referred to the loyalty of the people of 
Iran to the Islamic revolution and to the continued presence of 
the nation in different arenas. He said: You, as foreign 
diplomats based in Tehran, will witness the extensive presence 
of the various strata of people in the rallies tomorrow, 11 
February. You will witness that even after the passage of 15 
years, and despite enduring difficulties and hardship brought 
about by the imposed war and the process of reconstruction, our 
people are not prepared to allow the realities of their lives to 
be brought under the influence of negative and disheartening 
rumors and insinuations. He added: This shows the people's 
awareness and maturity on the one hand, and the failure of the 
imperialist media in attaining their inauspicious objectives, on 
the other hand. 
  According to a Central News Unit report, before remarks by 
the president, the ambassador of the Arab Republic of Libya [as 
heard] in Tehran spoke on behalf of the ambassadors as their 
doyen. During the course of his remarks, he congratulated the 
eminent leader, the president, and the revolutionary and 
liberated nation of Iran on the anniversary of the victory of 
the Islamic revolution. He said: We pay our respects to the 
lofty status of the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
the revered martyrs who sacrificed their lives for Iran's 
independence and freedom. We convey our respect to the blessed 
souls of these dear ones and hope that the Islamic Republic 
system and the heroic nation of Iran may always be able to 
achieve progress and success in reconstruction and development. 
The Libyan ambassador then condemned the plot to assassinate 
the president of our country and wished him health and success. 
  On the basis of this report, at the end of this audience, 
the 
ambassadors, diplomats, and the Iran-based representatives of 
foreign countries and international organizations held separate 
meetings with the president. During the course of their brief 
exchanges, they expressed their congratulations on the 
anniversary of victory of the Islamic revolution.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, Feb. 15, IRNA -- Iran's 
envoy to the United Nations Monday stressed that in case Serb 
forces refused to observe the NATO deadline, the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization must implement its threats against the Serbs. 
  Following the Serbs shelling of a trade center in Sarajevo 
in 
late January which claimed the lives of 68 people and over 200 
others were wounded, in a 10-day deadline last Wednesday the 
NATO urged the Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms from the 
vicinity of Sarajevo. It warned that in case the Serbs 
refrained from doing so NATO forces would strike them by air. 
  Iran's permanent representative at the United Nations Kamal 
Kharrazi in his remarks at the open session of the Security 
Council said that the recent moves to lift the seige of Sarajevo 
fell short of expectations. 
  He stressed that overall efforts should be made to ensure 
that all provisions of the ultimatum are met by the Serbs. 
  "In the event the ultimatum is violated, either through 
further shelling or failure to fully withdraw the Serbian heavy 
weaponry by the deadline, the air strikes must be automatically 
initiated," he said. 
  Kharrazi called on Security Council to allow Bosnia and 
those 
prepared to help the beseiged republic to take action under 
Article 51 of the UN Charter in individual and collective 
self-defence. 
  "Under the present circumstances, the least the 
international 
community can do is to lift the siege of Sarajevo and other 
cities and to lift the unjust arms embargo against the republic 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina." 
  He voiced concern over the efforts made by some powers to 
press the Bosnian Government to accept a so-called peace saying 
that it "will be the beginning of a more tragedy and ethnic 
cleansing." 
  He stressed that imposition of any settlement on the Bosnian 
Government would be "militarily unenforceable and morally 
unacceptable to the international community."

  [Text] Islamabad, Tehran, Feb. 14, IRNA -- The Iranian 
consulate in Lahore denied any involvement of the Iranian 
diplomats in the shooting at the leaders of the Wahhabi Sahabeh 
Corps in the city. 
  In a press release 13 February, the consulate said that the 
charges leveled in the complaint of a particular group against 
the Iranian diplomats were totally baseless and unfounded. 
  It also added, "Iran is against any kind of interference in 
the internal affairs of other countries." 
  Two leaders of the Wahhabi Sahabeh corps were shot and 
wounded by unidentified persons in Lahore Friday.

<F P=106> [Report by Walid Abi-Murshid: "After Failure of Its </F>
Endeavors With German Siemens And Czech Skoda, Iran Is 
Concluding Contract With Spanish Nuclear Company To Divert Two 
Reactors to Military Use"] 
  [Text] London -- Tehran is currently negotiating with a 
Spanish company for engineers and nuclear technology to supply 
it with the technology needed to divert four nuclear reactors in 
Iran from civilian to military use. 
  Iran turned to a Spanish company to supply it with the 
diversion technology known as "Diversion" [preceding word in 
English] after it failed in the past to obtain this technology 
from the German company Siemens and the Czech company Skoda. 
Iran accuses the German and Czech companies of submitting to 
U.S. pressure in their withdrawal from the project to offer 
their nuclear engineering services. As is known, the Spanish 
company dealt in the past with the German company Siemens and it 
has the nuclear engineering expertise available to the German 
company. The Spanish company participated with Siemens in 
building the Bushehr reactors in Iran. 
  After the failure of its previous attempts to obtain Western 
diversion technology, which is more advanced than Russian and 
Chinese technology, Tehran was eager to submit its new order for 
Spanish technology in the framework of its endeavors to improve 
safety levels for the two nuclear reactors it is building with 
Russian expertise in Gargar and the two reactors (300 megawatts) 
it is building with Chinese expertise in al-Ahvaz. 
  Nearly a month ago the Iranian Nuclear Energy Commission 
signed a contract with the Spanish company, under which the 
latter undertakes to provide engineering services for one of the 
two Chinese reactors in al-Ahvaz , and a similar contract to 
provide the same services for the the Russian Bushehr reactor, 
after signing a contract with the Russians to rebuild it. The 
deal concluded with the Spanish company totals $80 million. 
  In the first stage Iran hopes that the Spanish company will 
resume building the Bushehr reactor, 80 percent of which has 
been completed, before the German company Siemens pulls out of 
the project. 
  As is known, the capacity of this reactor is 1,000 
megawatts. 
  However, Tehran expects now to obtain technology from Spain 
to divert the Bushehr and Gargar reactors from civilian to 
military use. 
  Tehran's great interest in these negotiations is reflected 
in 
the level of its negotiating delegation, which is headed by Reza 
Amrollahi [as transliterated], assistant to President Rafsanjani 
for nuclear affairs and chairman of the Iranian Nuclear Energy 
Commission, his deputy Mahir 'Alizadeh, and Mohammad Kazem 
Rasuli, director of the Nuclear Technological Center in Esfahan 
(ENTC). 
  In charge of the negotiations from the Spanish side are the 
director general of the Spanish company and his assistant. The 
director general of the Spanish company participated with 
Siemens in building the Bushehr reactor. 
  It is worth mentioning that 300-megawatt nuclear reactors 
are 
technologically capable of being diverted from civilian to 
military use.

  [Excerpt] Lebanese officials are watching with keen 
interest this week's developments. After the resumption today 
of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Taba to work out the 
final details of the Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho and the transfer of civilian power, and on the eve of 
the bilateral negotiations in Washington, U.S. Ambassador to 
Lebanon Mark Hambley delivered to Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz 
a written message from U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  The ambassador would not reveal the contents of the message, 
saying only that it deals with the bilateral peace talks that 
will resume in Washington tomorrow. Hambley expressed optimism 
about the results of the talks. He said the deliberate tension 
and violence in southern Lebanon is aimed at undermining the 
talks. He stressed that his country is eager to maintain the 
peacekeeping forces in the south as a factor of stability in 
Lebanon. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri has stated that "there are two main sound ways of 
facing developments in the Middle East: consolidating internal 
unity and building the state's institutions." [passage omitted] 
  He said that the Syrian forces operating in Lebanon "are 
playing a positive role in maintaining security." He revealed 
that "they recently contributed to the arrest of those accused 
of killing the Jordanian diplomat" Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah. 
He said that the solution in the region "will not be at 
Lebanon's expense," referring in this connection to assurances 
from U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. He spoke of an agreement between Lebanon and Syria 
to sign the peace agreement together once it is achieved 
"because it is a matter of national security for both countries." 
  Al-Hariri made these revelations on the evening of the day 
before yesterday during a "seminar on the issues of the hour" 
held at the central school attached to the Lebanese Maronite 
monastery in Juniyah. [passage omitted] 
  Asked why the al-Ta'if agreement has not been implemented, 
particularly such matters as dissolution of all the militias, 
withdrawals of weapons, administrative decentralization, and 
formation of the economic and constitutional councils, al-Hariri 
said that "a decree will be issued about the Constitutional 
Council which has been formed after consultation with the Shura 
Council." He said that what was meant by decentralization under 
the al-Ta'if agreement was administrative not political 
decentralization. He said: "We are talking about Lebanon's 
unity. We cannot address that and at the same time speak of 
political decentralization. Lebanon is a small state. Should we 
divide it into many parts? That is out of the question." 
[passage omitted] 
  He said: "I do not believe that there is a single Lebanese 
who would not condemn the execution which occurred in Ba'labakk. 
Nobody can defend that and we cannot accept it. The judicial 
authorities have moved to act in this connection." He stressed 
the importance "of consolidating the judicial authority and 
expediting its procedures" within the democratic system. 
  Asked why the Syrian Army has not been redeployed in 
accordance with the al-Ta'if agreement, al-Hariri replied: 
"Under the agreement the Syrians are supposed to help the 
Lebanese state maintain security in the country." He spoke of 
promises of massive aid from abroad not honored except by three 
states, namely Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. "We just got 
advice from other states." He added that "the Army cannot be 
rebuilt with just words. It takes a major part of the budget, 
and that is our duty. We are engaged in negotiations with 
Israel and agreement on withdrawal may be achieved. We all know 
that one of the most important conditions for withdrawal is 
security. That is the duty of the Lebanese state. In other 
words, a major part of the Lebanese Army would go to the south 
to assume responsibility for security. Are we now able to 
maintain security in all parts of the Lebanese Republic or do we 
need some time and assistance? Some states sent us some aid for 
the Army, consisting of vehicles, trucks, light weapons, and 
many promises. In practical terms, we have not received aid 
that would enable our Army to maintain security in all parts of 
the Lebanese Republic. We should not hide behind our hands on 
this matter. Not long ago an official of the Jordanian Embassy 
was assassinated and the perpetrators were arrested. The truth 
is that the Syrians contributed to the apprehension of the 
culprits. Since I assumed my government post the Syrians, I can 
confirm, have been playing a positive role. We should all seek 
to strengthen the Army and the Internal Security Forces and in 
fact all the security authorities so that they can assume 
responsibility for security throughout the republic." 
  Asked why there are still Syrian Army barriers in the 
streets and why the Internal Security Forces should not man 
these barriers, he replied: "We need the Syrian forces to 
maintain security. They are present at some barriers and not at 
others, according to need. These are military matters." 
  Al-Hariri pointed out that "the position of the state and 
the 
government is that the solution in the Middle East will not be 
at Lebanon's expense. That is what the Americans assured us of 
in two messages from President Clinton and his secretary of 
state. Secretary Christopher assured me of this personally, 
directly after the Geneva summit. To say that the solution 
would be at Lebanon's expense is out of the question." [passage 
omitted] 
  He was asked: If Israel told Lebanon that it was willing to 
withdraw from the occupied Lebanese territory, would the state 
accept such a withdrawal separately from Syria or would it await 
the results of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations? He replied: 
"Israel never said that it was willing to withdraw from Lebanon. 
It said it was willing to sign a peace agreement with Lebanon. 
If there is going to be a peace agreement, we and Syria should 
be together. Resolution 425 means unconditional Israeli 
withdrawal from Lebanon. We demand that. When President Hafiz 
al-Asad met with President Clinton, he asked him openly to 
implement that resolution. Its implementation means Israel's 
withdrawal. So let it withdraw. We have no problem with that, 
nor has Syria, but when it comes to signing a peace agreement 
with Israel, we and Syria should be together. Why do we say 
this? Because the matter concerns our national security and 
Syria's national security." [passage omitted] 
  He denied deep differences between the three leaders [the 
prime minister, the president, and the speaker of the chamber of 
deputies). He expressed the belief that time will correct the 
experiment. He said that it is inaccurate to use the word 
hegemony (of one authority over another). [passage omitted] 
  Al-Hariri emphasized that "there will be no government 
changes or reshuffle for the time being." He said that the 
reason there is continuous talk about that "is that there are 
some who do not like the situation, and the best way of 
weakening the government is to say that it is on its way out." 
  He said that, in his view, "the ministers act on the basis 
that the government will not change for the time being, but that 
does not mean it will be there forever. It would fall if the 
Chamber of Deputies withdrew confidence from it or if one third 
of the ministers resigned, or if the prime minister resigned. I 
have no intention of resigning at the present time." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi has stressed that Lebanon 
wants land in return for peace and wants sovereignty over its 
territory in return for peace. He said resistance is a result, 
not a cause of the Israeli occupation, and Israel's withdrawal 
will return things to their old situation. President al-Hirawi 
reiterated that there can be no just and comprehensive peace 
before liberating the south and Western al-Biqa', because this 
is the will of all Lebanese. 
  President al-Hirawi was speaking at an iftar [fast-breaking] 
banquet hosted by Mrs. Randa Birri, head of the Lebanese 
Handicapped Society at the Summerland Hotel. The iftar was 
attended by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, Prime 
Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, and a number of ministers, deputies, 
and foreign diplomats.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and his delegation at his 
office at the Prime Ministry this morning. 
  Talks dealt with the friendly bilateral relations and the 
assistance that France can provide to Jordan in the fields of 
tourism, transportation, and infrastructure. Discussions also 
dealt with ways in which France can participate to advance the 
peace process in the region. 
  Talks also dealt with ways to ease Jordan's financial 
difficulties resulting from its commitment to the UN resolutions 
dealing with sanctions on Iraq and the inspection of ships 
heading for al-'Aqabah port since France is a member of the UN 
Sanctions Committee and the Security Council. 
  The guest minister promised to raise and discuss these 
issues 
with the officials in his country in order to achieve the best 
results. 
  The meeting was attended by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting 
minister of state for foreign affairs, and the French ambassador 
in Amman. 
  Meanwhile, the Jordanian side led by Dr. Abu-al-Ghanam, and 
the French side led by Alain Juppe, held talks at the Prime 
Ministry this morning in which bilateral relations and issues of 
mutual interest were discussed. 
  In a statement to journalists following the talks, Finance 
Minister Sami Qammuh said that the two sides discussed bilateral 
relations in the political, economic, and cultural fields with 
emphasis on a subject that is important to Jordan, that is, 
Jordan's foreign debts that are beyond Jordan's means, 
especially since the Paris Club's upcoming meeting late March 
will discuss rescheduling the Jordanian debts. 
  Gammu said the guest minister has expressed his country's 
full understanding of Jordan's position, and his support for 
Jordan's positions and role in the region, as well as the 
importance of bolstering this position and easing Jordan's 
burdens, particularly its foreign debts. 
  He added that Juppe showed full understanding, and promised 
to support Jordan during the Paris Club meeting that will 
discuss rescheduling debts for 1994. These debts amount to 
about $950 million, excluding the financing gap. 
  He said: Jordan's demand was not to be restricted to a 
rescheduling process, which is a way of delaying these debts. 
Our demand is to ease and reduce these debts because they 
constitute a burden, and this step will not be easy without the 
consensus of the international community. 
  He emphasized that the guest minister promised to extend all 
appropriate support through the EEC and the Paris Club members.

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has stressed the 
firmness and depth of the long-standing relations between Jordan 
and France. He reiterated France's appreciation of His Majesty 
King Husayn's wise and moderate views on many international and 
regional issues. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Amman today, Juppe said he 
came to Jordan and the region with two objectives. He said his 
objectives are represented by reiterating France's commitment to 
the peace initiative in the region, signed by the Palestinians 
and the Israelis on 13 September, as well as by expressing 
appreciation of Jordan's contribution as represented by the 
signing of the Jordanian-Israeli agenda on 14 September. 
Furthermore, he added, the visit is designed to stress the ties 
of friendship and cooperation between the two friendly countries 
in various fields. 
  Juppe said France is concerned about helping Jordan 
reschedule its debts during the upcoming Paris Club meeting. He 
said an agreement had been reached with the Jordanian officials 
to review all aspects of the agreement signed between the two 
countries in 1965 in order to expand it and develop it to be 
more comprehensive and more effective within the framework of 
the joint committee between the two countries. This, Juppe 
added, will foster greater cooperation, noting the French desire 
to increase cooperation within the civil service. 
  The French foreign minister said that during his talks with 
Jordanian officials, he became aware of the difficulties facing 
the Jordanian economy as a result of the siege of the Port of 
al-'Aqabah. He stressed France's readiness to alleviate the 
burden of the embargo on Jordan without detriment to the 
objectives of the sanctions.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said 
Sunday [13 February] his country hoped that the "legal status" 
of the Holy City of Jerusalem would be discussed during the 
interim period of Palestinian autonomy rather than fina status 
negotiations. 
  "We have a responsibility towards the holy places (in 
Jerusalem) historically," Mr. Juppe told a press conference 
Sunday, adding that "we hope that the legal status of Jerusalem 
can be discussed during the interim period" and not in final 
status talks. 
  Middle East peace negotiations were accepted by Israel back 
in 1991 on the condition that the issue of Jerusalem be deferred 
till final-status talks despite repeated efforts by Palestinians 
and other Arab parties to resolve the issue of the Holy City 
along other territories occupied by Israel in 1967. 
  Palestinians have grudgingly accepted the delay in 
negotiations over Jerusalem until final status talks but have 
repeatedly said that they would not accept a final settlement 
without Jerusalem. 
  Israel "annexed" east Jerusalem immediately after the 1967 
war and claimed the city as its "eternal capital." 
  His Majesty King Husayn who severed legal and administrative 
ties with the Israeli-occupied West Bank in 1988, has maintained 
Awqaf (religious) links with the Holy city for fear of creating 
a "sovereignty vacuum" during interim talks. 
  Mr. Juppe, in his remarks to the press before leaving Amman 
to the Nabatean city of Petra on a private visit Sunday, 
welcomed last week's Israel-Palestine Liberation Oranisation 
(PLO) accord on security arrangements for Palestinian self-rule. 
  But he said that Israel must stick to a timetable on 
withdrawal and transfer of power provided for in the 
Palestinian-Israeli autonomy agreement signed in Washington in 
September. 
  "It is true the (security) accord did not solve all problems 
but it is a positive step in the process," Mr. Juppe said at the 
end of a 24-hour visit to Jordan, part of a Middle East tour 
that was to take him to Israel later on Sunday and to Gaza on 
Tuesday. 
  "But most importantly, the timetable has to be respected in 
order not to upset the process and strengthen the opponents of 
peace," he said. 
  On Jordanian-French bilateral relations, Mr. Juppe said that 
he had a dual purpose in visiting Jordan for the second time in 
four months. 
  "One purpose is to reiterate my country's commitment to the 
peace process which we have supported enthusiastically since its 
first days," Mr. Juppe said. 
  "I also wanted to underline the warm relations between our 
two countries," he added. 
  Mr. Juppe said he met with Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali Sunday morning as well as the ministers of finance, 
planning and trade and industry. 
  He was also received by King Husayn Saturday. "We attach 
great importance to His Majesty's balanced and moderate vision," 
Mr. Juppe said. 
  He reiterated France's backing for Jordan's efforts to 
reschedule its foreign debts, adding that France would help the 
Kingdom in debt rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of 
official Western creditors which will be held in Paris in March. 
  He added that his country would also study the possibility 
of 
transferring part of the Kingdom's $900 million debt to France 
"into investment projects." 
  Mr. Juppe also said France had renewed an 83 million franc 
($14 million) financial protocol for Jordan as part of efforts 
to help Amman cope with its economic problems. 
  Mr. Juppe also said his country would consider easing 
inspections of al-'Aqabah-bound ships to help reduce the 
negative impact on Jordan of the international sanctions against 
Iraq. 
  He said France was ready to examine in "an open and 
constructive manner ways of easing inspections of ships, while 
maintaining their effectiveness, so that the Jordanian economy 
is hurt less." 
  The minister rejected an Israeli Television report that 
France had lifted its self-imposed restrictions on arms sales to 
Israel. 
  "We have not taken such a decision, but we hope military 
cooperation with Israel will be reviewed," he said. 
  Mr. Juppe said French Defence Minister Francois Leotard is 
also expected to visit Israel soon. 
  On Bosnia, Mr. Juppe also said Paris was not considering an 
immediate evacuation of its diplomats from war-torn Sarajevo 
with Western air strikes threatened if the siege of the city is 
not lifted. 
  "It is imperative that we remain patient," he said. "We will 
take all necessary measures as the situation warrants, but it is 
important that the NATO decision be implemented as soon as 
possible. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has set a Feb. 20 
deadline for the warring factions in Sarajevo to place heavy 
weapons under U.N. control or move them away from the city. 
  [Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic on 14 February on page 22 publishes 
a similar report on Juppe's news conference with the following 
addition "Regarding the Iraq embargo, Juppe said all that France 
wants is Iraq's implementation of Security Council resolutions, 
pointing out that France has no premediated intentions to 
perpetuate the embargo. Juppe wondered whether has Iraq 
implemented all Security Council resolutions particularly the 
resolution related to borders between the two countries and the 
resolution on the sovereignty of Kuwait?"]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Jordan's Debts, and Mr. Juppe's Visit"] </F>
  [Text] The visit to Jordan by French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe was an opportunity to renew the talk on Jordan's foreign 
debts that have burdened its economy and influenced its 
development requisites. 
  The minister is aware that these debts were the result of 
regional and international circumstances that forced Jordan--due 
to its position--to bear the consequences of these circumstances. 
  The instability in the region, whose responsibility is 
shouldered by the entire international community, forced Jordan 
to be on the longest Arab front with Israel. This exhausted a 
huge portion of the loans Jordan was forced to seek. 
  At a time when Israel was receiving all forms of support 
from 
the United States and the allied countries, including France, 
Jordan was not receiving even the Arab assistance decided by 
Arab summit conferences, whose decisions were not respected. 
Jordan's share of international support was below what is 
needed although Jordan was a main victim of the Western allies' 
support for Israel and the Cold War between the Eastern and 
Western blocs. 
  Juppe emphasized that his country will support the 
rescheduling of Jordan's debts, and the United States had 
earlier announced that it was seriously studying economic and 
military support for Jordan. We hope that these encouraging 
signs would be implemented in order to compensate this country 
for the losses caused by circumstances that Jordan did not 
create and for which it is not responsible. Based on its 
position, message, and principles, Jordan remained committed to 
its principles and endured the consequences of such commitment 
and the duties stipulated in the pan-Arab and international 
charters. 
  Jordan stands as a main test for the international good 
intentions toward stability and justice in the Middle East. The 
more Jordan is compensated for its debts and burden caused by 
instability and lack of justice, the more the international 
intentions toward the region and the future relations with it 
would be in the right direction.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Jordanian-French Talks"] </F>
  [Text] The agenda of the meeting between His Majesty King 
Husayn and the visiting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
expanded to include a number of important topics, including 
regional and bilateral issues, the Middle East peace process, 
and latest developments, especially the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement recently concluded in Cairo. 
  This meeting was a good opportunity for His Majesty King 
Husayn to emphasize anew the constants of Jordan's firm position 
in supporting the ongoing peace process and realizing the 
aspired peace in the region based on the principles of 
international legitimacy, and the UN and Security Council 
resolutions led by Resolutions 242 and 338. 
  In view of the vital role France is playing in the Bonsian 
crisis, whether its leading role within the EC or the Security 
Council, it was natural for the Jordanian-French talks to deal 
with the Bosnian conflict and to discuss ways of cooperation on 
bringing an end to the tragic situation of the Muslims there, 
and realize security, stability, and peace in that region. 
  The broad background of the Jordanian-French relations and 
the continued positive development in the history of cooperation 
between Amman and Paris have always allowed for the exchange of 
views on the basis of mutual respect regarding many issues and 
subjects that concern the two friendly countries, including 
economic and cultural cooperation between Jordan and France. 
  We know beforehand that France can always play a more vital, 
if not pioneering, role in this region's issues, especially 
since this leading European state has continued to enjoy 
political broadmindedness, and its vital role in the Middle East 
has continued to be welcomed by all parties to the conflict. 
This qualifies France to play a welcome role in entrenching 
stability, realizing peace, and accelerating the development 
process.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today 
received in his office at the Prime Ministry the commissioner of 
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [UNRWA], General 
Ilter Turkmen. The two sides discussed relations and issues of 
common interest, especially services provided by the UNRWA to 
refugees, including educational, health, environmental, and 
infrastructural services as well as public utilities. 
  Dr. al-Majali thanked Mr. Turkmen for the aid and services 
provided by UNRWA to the refugees in Jordan. He requested the 
upgrading of the level of these services in order to improve 
refugees' living conditions. 
  In a press statement, Turkmen said he explained to the prime 
minister how things are going in the West Bank and Gaza. He 
told him about UNRWA activities and projects to enhance the 
economic and social situation in the occupied territories. He 
noted that in Gaza alone, UNRWA is now spending around $80 
milion on various projects. 
  He said that during the meeting the two sides discussed 
developments in the peace process, what the talks have achieved 
to date, and what the concerned parties were able to accomplish 
during this process. 
  About his visit to Jordan, Turkmen said: This visit aims at 
contacting and holding talks with the Jordanian Government and 
officials on various issues related to Palestinian refugees. He 
said this visit is designed to inspect and the situation and the 
progress of work at the UNRWA branch in Jordan, as well as the 
activities and services it provides and ways to improve them, 
through meetings with its members and officials. 
  Asked about the financial crisis facing the UNRWA, he said: 
We are facing a financial problem in our general budget. The 
problem is financing ordinary and current expenses and the 
services provided by UNRWA, including educational, health, and 
other services. He added that UNRWA is currently receiving much 
support from donor states, such as the United States, Japan, and 
the EC, to finance its projects. He noted that since the 
signing of the 13 September agreement, UNRWA has been promised 
about $60 million dollars to implement UNRWA projects. 
  The meeting was attended by 'Adil Irshayd, minister of 
state, 
and Dennis Brown, head of the UNRWA office in Jordan.

  [Text] The masses of the national capital staged a march 
this morning led by members of the Transitional National 
Assembly [TNA] to condemn the savage crimes of the Serbs against 
the Muslims in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The marchers 
moved from Martyrs' Square through University Street to the UN 
building, condemning the iniquitous aggression and barbarous 
attacks against the Bosnian people and the UN's reluctance to 
lift the arms embargo, which is preventing the Bosnian people 
from defending themselves and their property. 
  Dr. Shakir al-Sarraj, chairman of the TNA's foreign 
relations 
committee delivered to the UN representative in Khartoum a 
memorandum in which the citizens and political and people's 
organizations demanded the lifting of the arms embargo to enable 
the Bosnian Muslims to confront the Serbian aggression launched 
to exterminate the Muslims. The memorandum also appealed to 
[words indistinct] parliaments and the Islamic nation to act to 
rescue the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The UN representative thanked the Sudanese Government and 
people for their support for the Bosnian people in their ordeal. 
He promised to submit the memorandum to the UN Security Council. 
  Meanwhile, Major General Muhammad 'Abdallah Uwaydah, 
chairman 
of the TNA's security and defense committee, stressed that the 
Sudanese people want to be the vanguard of the defenders of the 
Muslim people in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina against the 
hideous massacres they are being subjected to by the aggressive 
Serbian forces. Maj. Gen. Uwaydah commented on the president of 
the Republic's statement about Sudan's readiness to send forces 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina to participate in preserving security and 
stability under the auspices of the United Nations saying, Sudan 
wants to send its forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina to help preserve 
security and stability and to safeguard the honor being violated 
there with the full knowledge of the bellicose states. Maj. 
Gen. Uwaydah reiterated Sudan's readiness to send its forces to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to carry out humanitarian tasks, saying the 
Sudanese people are urged by Islam and its principles to help 
the [word indistinct] and to support the weak.

  [Text] Nairobi, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Sudanese rebels said Monday 
[14 February] that 281 people had been killed or wounded in a 
government offensive against the southern town of Mundri, near 
the border with Zaire. UN and relief officials said more than 
100,000 Sudanese were fleeing a major onslaught by government 
warplanes and troops against rebel-held territory in the 
drought-hit south. 
  The offensive could be the final push by Khartoum's Islamic 
fundamentalist military government to end the decades-old 
rebellion in the black and largely Christian south, diplomats 
and aid workers said. 
  The aid workers said a government ban on relief flights to 
southern areas along the Ugandan border had disrupted food 
supplies to about 200,000 displaced people living on aid. The 
UN has appealed for funds to continue relief operations in the 
south, where agriculture, already thrown into chaos by the civil 
war, has also been hit by a severe drought. 
  The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) said that 
"more than 281 civilians were killed or wounded" in the 
bombardment and bombing of Mundri, in Western Equatoria province. 
  There was no independent confirmation as most aid workers 
left Mundri last week when government forces closed in on rebels 
defending the town. 
  In a statement released here Monday, one of the two rival 
SPLA factions said it had repelled the government offensive and 
the army was retreating northwards from Mundri. A spokesman for 
John Garang's mainstream faction said the rebels had killed 67 
government soldiers, but the claim was also unconfirmed. 
  The SPLA splintered into two factions in 1991, and the 
government has since taken advantage of the rebels' internal 
divisions to drive them out of most of the southern garrison 
towns which they had captured.

  [Excerpt] Algiers, 14 Feb (MENA)--Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, former 
Sudanese prime minister and opposition leader, has accused the 
Sudanese Government of responsibility for the armed attack 
against a mosque in Khartoum. He said the government has 
facilitated the entry of extremists from various countries of 
the world into Sudan. Addressing the Ansar al-Sunnah group, 
whose mosque was attacked last week, al-Mahdi said that the 
government has opened the country's doors to extremists who only 
believe in violence and reject any dialogue to resolve 
differences. 
  In statements published by the Algerian French-language 
paper 
EL WATAN today, al-Mahdi added that this incident, which left 16 
people dead, is regarded as the most serious in Sudan since the 
military coup carried out by 'Umar al-Bashir in 1989. 
  He noted that Sudan has become a place of refuge for all the 
extremists from the various countries of the world, including 
the Egyptian Islamic groups, the Tunisian Islamic Ennahda 
Movement, the Moroccan al-'Adl wa al-Ihsan Group, and the 
Algerian Islamic Salvation Front, as well as leader of the 
Sudanese Islamic Front Hasan al-Turabi. 
  The Algerian EL WATAN said that 50 leaders of these groups 
will form a council that will meet regularly in Sudan. There is 
already a smaller council consisting of 15 top leaders, 
including Algerian FIS leaders Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj. 
The paper noted that after their arrest, Rached Ghannouchi, 
leader of the Tunisian Islamic Ennahda Movement, has become the 
most important figure in this council. 
  The paper wondered whether the extremists admitted into the 
country by the Sudanese Government were behind the armed attack 
that took place against the mosque of the Ansar al-Sunnah group, 
which is opposed to the government and is being persecuted by 
the Sudanese authorities. [passage omitted]

the accused Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Halifi, who participated

investigations had indicated him to be of Najdi origin and that 
his family had emigrated in the 1920's to Tunisia and now 
resided in Libya. The minister said the accused had confessed 
participating in the hideous incident together with his 
colleagues. The minister said those named during the 
investigations were now being interrogated.

  [Text] Khartoum, 10 Feb (PANA) -- A Libyan, Chadian and 
Sudanese were involved in last Friday's bloody attack on a 
Khartoum mosque which claimed the lives of 16 worshippers and 
injured 20 others, Sudan radio reported on Thursday. The radio 
quoted an Interior Ministry statement as saying Mohamed 
'Abdallah Abdul Rahman al-Khilaifi, who was first identified as 
a Moroccan, is a Libyan. Khilaifi, who has been in Sudan for one 
year, was injured when security men engaged the attackers in a 
shoot out last Saturday. The statement said his family migrated 
from Saudi Arabia to Libya in 1928 and live in the north African 
country. The statement identified two attackers who were killed 
in the shootout as Abdulabgi Yousif from Chad and Yassir Mohamed 
'Ali from Sudan. The two had been described only as "West 
Africans" on Sunday. 
  Meanwhile, the Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir, said on 
Wednesday that those accused of involvement in the mosque attack 
would be given a fair trial. He said the attackers also planned 
to kill a Saudi businessman, Usama bin Ladin, who lives in exile 
in Sudan. 
  The Sudanese Government has said there is no link between 
the 
gunmen and the radical Islamic movement, the Takfir and Hijra 
Islamic fundamentalist organization. The movement, which was 
born in Egypt during the days of slain Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat, was known for terrorist activities.

  [Text] Khartoum, Feb 13 (AFP) -- Sudanese security 
authorities have arrested a fourth suspect in the assault on a 
mosque in which 16 people were killed and and 20 others wounded 
earlier this month, a newspaper report said Sunday [13 February]. 
  Two of the assailants were killed and two others were 
wounded 
and arrested in a shootout with security forces on February 5, 
the day after the massacre. 
  A Palestinian identified as Munir Khalil, had been arrested 
on the day of the attack at the Ansar Souna mosque in Omdurman, 
near here. 
  The AL SUDANI INTERNATIONAL daily Sunday reported that the 
fourth suspect, identified as Mohamed al-Mahi, a Sudanese, was 
arrested at Er-Roseiris in central Sudan and brought to Khartoum 
for interrogation. 
  Mahi told investigators that he left Khartoum the day before 
the attack because he was not convinced of the assassination 
operation despite his conviction of the teachings of his 
extremist group. 
  Mahi, according to the paper, confessed that they were 
planning to assassinate Sudanese Islamist leader Hassan Abdalla 
al-Turabi and that for this reason their ring-leader, Libyan 
Mohamed Abdalla al- Khilaifi (now under arrest in hospital) 
inspected the surroundings of Turabi's residence in preparation 
for carrying out the assassination.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sudan and the Latest Suspect Attack"] </F>
  [Text] The attack launched by an extremist group on the 
Ansar al-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyah mosque in Omdurman, in which 
about 16 worshippers were killed, calls for concern not only 
because of the number of casualties but because of its timing 
and indications as far as Sudan, its stability, and its security 
are concerned. 
  Two days after the attack some Western news agencies began 
talking about a horrible scenario in Sudan similar to the 
Lebanese civil war and the conflict between the militias in 
Somalia. 
  If we examine the sequence of events over the past three 
months, from the mutual expulsion of ambassadors by Khartoum and 
London, to the U.S. media campaigns focusing on the violation of 
human rights in the south, to the Washington conference to which 
the opposition factions were invited with the implicit blessing 
of the State Department, we would realize that something is 
being hatched for Sudan and its people. 
  True, there are differences of opinion between some Sudanese 
political groups and the present Sudanese regime, especially 
over the absence of democracy of the Western parliamentary type 
based on direct free elections, but, noticeably, most of the 
regimes on which the opposition depends are also lacking in 
democracy and freedom of expression. It is perhaps worth noting 
that the regimes which support some Sudanese groups in their 
legitimate struggle for democracy are the very same regimes 
which had plotted against the Sudanese democratic experiment 
which flourished after the downfall of President Ja'far 
Numayri's regime in an unprecedented popular uprising. 
  The danger currently threatening Sudan necessitates that 
both 
government and opposition face it jointly in one trench because 
its aim is to tear the country apart and plunge it into 
devastating wars that would blow away all the positive 
achievements such as food self-sufficiency, freezing of foreign 
debts, and elimination of many aspects of corruption. For all 
to be able to stand in the same trench, there should be dialogue 
and frankness based on loyalty to the homeland and its 
territorial integrity, not on the basis of revenge and suspect 
foreign links. 
  The fact that the United States has been hostile to Sudan 
and 
has added its name to the terrorist list is in itself proof that 
there is something positive in Sudan, something not to the 
liking of certain Western circles known for not always harboring 
good intentions toward the Arabs and Muslims. 
  Why is the United States antagonistic to Sudan when there 
are 
no common borders, interests, trade exchange, or oil 
transactions between the two? What really disturbs some Western 
quarters about Sudan is that in Sudan there is a desire for real 
independence, self-sufficiency, a complete Islamic program, and 
equality, and an eagerness to open the country to Arab and 
Islamic investments and to apply the Islamic Shari'ah. The 
American rule is subservience of the regimes to the will of the 
White House and the states in its orbit. The exception is 
promotion of an Arab Islamic identity outside the framework of 
U.S. hegemony. When corruption was the only certainty in Sudan 
and when Western intelligence services were acting freely there 
under different names such as relief and human rights 
organizations, Sudan was at the top of the list of states 
satisfactory to both West and East, but when it tried to steer a 
different course the picture changed completely. 
  Is it not worth noting that Eritrea, which had received 
every 
possible aid and support from Sudan's Islamic regime, is now 
complaining about its fundamentalism and denying all the aid the 
Sudanese people extended to the Eritrean people until they 
achieved independence? Is it not worth noting that former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter was the one who refuted the current U.S. 
Administration's allegations about terrorism in Sudan, while 
some of the latter's own people are volunteering to confirm 
these charges? 
  It is difficult to claim that everything the Sudanese regime 
does is sound and positive. There are, without doubt, some 
reservations, particulary about the lack of democracy, but when 
the plot goes so far as trying to undermine security, drown the 
country in civil wars, and strengthen the secessionists and 
supply them with the means to sustain the war of attrition in 
the country, then many of the reservations should be set aside, 
at least temporarily. Sudan's unity, national independence, and 
dignity as a sovereign state must take priority over all other 
considerations.

<F P=106> [Interview with John Garang, leader of the Sudanese People's </F>
Liberation Army, SPLA, by 'Afaf Zayn; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Zayn] Since the issuance of the Washington 
declarartion, the National Democratic Grouping [NDG] has not 
been able to convene its congress and adopt a unified stand on 
the peoples' right to self-determination in southern Sudan and 
the neglected areas. This is despite the fact that the SPLA 
considers self-determination a firm strategic position that it 
will discuss with the Sudanese Government under the sponsorship 
of the IFAD [International Fund for Agricultural Development] 
states. Are you concerned over the NDG's failure to reach a 
unified stand on the principle of self-determination? 
  [Garang] All the constitutional documents endorsed by the 
NDG, the last of which was the Nairobi declaration, include the 
right of the south and the neglected areas to 
self-determination. In light of this, the failure to reach an 
agreement on a meeting to reformulate what has previously been 
accepted is a political setback that cannot be understood. The 
right to self-determination is a basic component of democracy 
and human rights. Therefore, if the NDG denies this right of 
the people of the south and the neglected area, the parties to 
the NDG will be placed on an equal footing with the party 
oppressing the people in the south and their ethnic and 
religious sects. 
  I believe that the basic issue that must be discussed is not 
just the right to self-determination, but also the objective 
circumstances that forced broad sectors of the Sudanese people 
to demand the right to self-determination. The scheduled 
meeting of the NDG will not discuss the right to 
self-determination, but will reach agreement on the best way to 
topple the Sudanese regime and to reach an understanding on 
running the country in the stage that will follow the downfall 
of the regime. 
  In the past, I proposed Harare as a possible venue for the 
NDG meeting. Cairo was also mentioned as a possible venue. The 
meeting will be held when the appropriate circumstances become 
available. [passage omitted] 
  [Zayn] If the NDG fails to adopt a position supporting the 
right to self-determination, which the SPLA views as a basic 
point in its negotiating strategy, what will be the fate of the 
alliance? 
  [Garang] The NDG parties cannot reject the principle of 
self-determination after they have already accepted it as an 
article in constitutional documents worked out by the alliance. 
I think that the collapse of the current regime in Khartoum 
will lead to a stage where there will be no need to call for 
self-determination when the reasons that led to these calls are 
removed. But if the call for self-determination continues after 
the collapse of the current regime, it will mean that the 
successor regime has also failed to offer a final solution to 
the problems in Sudan. [passage omitted] 
  [Zayn] If certain influential northern voices within the 
alliance continue to reject the right to self-determination 
despite their previous acceptance and their commitment to the 
constitutional documents that contain this principle, and if the 
SPLA -- with its two wings -- continues to adhere to the right 
to self-determination for the south and the neglected areas, 
will the NDG remain a viable alliance framework between the SPLA 
and the northern parties, despite this dilemma that is 
threatening its existence? What form of relations link you to 
your allies in the northern parties? 
  [Garang] Our alliance is, in the first place, with the 
Sudanese people, and these relations are based on joint efforts 
to topple the current regime. If this objective is not 
realized, stability and peace in the region around Sudan will be 
in question. The current regime wants to incite instability and 
political confusion, and wants to strike at the peaceful 
coexistence in eastern Africa and the Middle East. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Sudan has said that paragraphs occurring in the 
report of Gaspard Biru, who is the special rapporteur on human 
rights in Sudan, represent a deliberate insult to the Islamic 
religion, and they make it necessary to interrogate the author 
of the report and be condemned by all states, authorities and 
organizations, which respect the rights of man and humanity. 
This is because of the insult against Islam included in the 
report. 
  In a statement issued yesterday by the Foreign Ministry in 
this connection, it strongly condemned the insult addressed by 
the rapporteur against the Islamic religion and its beliefs. 
The Foreign Ministry demanded the ommission of the paragraphs 
from the report touching on this matter. The statement pointed 
out that Biru's report is part of a bigger plot targeting the 
Islamic religion and its beliefs.

  [Text] Nairobi, Feb 12 (AFP) -- A Sudanese rebel leader on 
Saturday called on the UN to intervene to stop what he called 
the Islamic fundamentalist government's extermination and 
enslavement of people in the mainly Christian south. 
  Riak Machar, head of one of two rival factions of the rebel 
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said Khartoum's military 
government had taken advantage of the rebels' divisions to 
launch its biggest offensive ever in the past two months. "An 
estimated four million people are at risk of death in south 
Sudan due to the Sudan government military offensive, drought 
and starvation," Machar told a news conference in the Kenyan 
capital Nairobi. 
  UN officials said at least two million people were 
threatened 
with starvation in the rebel-held south, as well as another two 
million displaced southerners living in squalid camps around 
Khartoum. They said the offensive was driving 140,000 
southerners towards the Ugandan border. "The deplorable and 
despicable practices of slavery and slave trade have surfaced," 
Machar said. 
  Speaking a day after UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali 
expressed concern about the escalation of the war and widespread 
human rights violations by all sides, Machar accused government 
forces of kidnapping children and selling them to Sudanese 
farmers and to Saudi Arabia and Libya. 
  He said the government was "exporting its brand of Iranian 
Islamic fundamentalism to neighbouring states of Egypt, Eritrea, 
Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda." Eritrea has complained of attacks 
by terrorist groups based in Sudan. 
  Machar urged the United Nations to appoint a peace mediator 
to negotiate an end to the decades-old conflict between the 
Arabised north and the largely black south which erupted into 
full-scale civil war in 1983. 
  Machar, who broke with SPLA leader John Garang in 1991 to 
form the SPLA-United splinter group, urged the United Nations to 
impose an oil and arms embargo on Sudan, "establish safe havens 
for civilians in south Sudan, and put pressure on Khartoum to 
accept an immediate ceasefire and allow in relief supplies." He 
said the United Nations should send peacekeepers if Khartoum 
refused to comply, dismissing suggestions that the world body 
could not despatch troops without government approval. 
  "There is no government in south Sudan," Machar said. "The 
government is in the north. We have been fighting one another 
for the past 40 years. The war is a result of imposed unity and 
imposed Arabic, Islam, racial hatred and religious intolerance." 
  Western diplomats, however, said the United Nations was 
unlikely to intervene in Sudan after its debacle in Somalia. 
They also noted that intervention would be complicated because 
the conflict was three-sided, as Machar's Nuer tribesmen had 
often fought Garang's Dinka forces. Machar denied Garang's 
accusation that his forces had fought on the government's side. 
  The two rebel factions agreed in December to press for a 
referendum on southern self-determination, a demand rejected by 
the government which fears secession of the south. 
  The government has banned relief flights to key destinations 
along the southern border with Uganda while sending warplanes 
and tens of thousands of troops south in what diplomats said 
looked like a final push to crush the rebellion. Most foreign 
relief workers have been forced to leave. 
  Machar accused Khartoum of "using food as a weapon" and 
trying to "exterminate the civilian population of south Sudan by 
starvation."

<F P=106> [Report by Amir Taheri: "Rabeh Kebir Criticizes Khartoum </F>
Move; France Turns Down Sudanese Offer To Mediate With Algerian 
Salvation Front"] 
  [Text] London -- High-ranking French sources confirmed 
yesterday that the French Government had turned down a Sudanese 
offer for Sudanese circles to play the role of "honest broker" 
between the Algerian Government and the Islamic Salvation Front 
[FIS]. 
  However, contacts between Sudanese authorities and Israel 
over Khartoum's mediation with Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the 
occupied territories have continued in Europe and the United 
States. 
  The Sudanese move took place in December when "mutual 
friends" conveyed a message from Khartoum to Paris. The 
Sudanese message said that an alliance between "the Armed Forces 
and Islamists along the lines of the Sudanese model" could solve 
the Algerian problem. A senior Sudanese intelligence officer 
visited Paris twice in January and met with Defense Ministry 
officials. 
  The French sources confirmed that a meeting was held between 
Colonel Jean-Claude Mantione [as transliterated], an expert in 
black Africa affairs, and the Sudanese general. However, the 
sources said that the meeting did not broach the situation in 
Algeria. Instead, the two men discussed the regional dispute 
between Central Africa and Sudan. There are reports that Bangui 
is planning to occupy a strip of Sudanese territory which it 
claims belongs to it. 
  First reports about the secret contacts between Paris and 
Khartoum emerged last month. The news provoked opposition and 
criticism from Sudanese opposition leaders in Cairo. They met 
with the French ambassador in Cairo. He denied the report, 
describing them as baseless. 
  Khartoum has for some time persisted in presenting itself to 
the West as a mediator with fundamentalist forces in Africa and 
the Middle East. And Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary general of 
the National Islamic Front in Sudan, expressed his support for 
the agreement between the PLO and Israel. He also criticized 
Algerian FIS leader Abassi Madani for not taking account of 
France's opinion during the general elections two years ago. 
  FIS leaders in exile have rejected Khartoum's move vis-a-vis 
Algeria. In a press interview yesterday Rabeh Kebir said that 
he had heard about these contacts from the media only. He said 
"if that is true, it is regrettable, because it represents a 
biased move in favor of the military group in Algeria." 
  Contacts with Israel began in Geneva last year when two 
Sudanese envoys met with a Swiss businessman close to Tel Aviv. 
  Western intelligence sources say that Khartoum offered to 
help win over the support of the Palestinian rejectionist 
movements, especially Hamas, opposed to the agreement between 
the PLO and Israel. In return, Khartoum wanted Israel to help 
to open the channel of dialogue with Washington. 
  In December Hasan al-Turabi persuaded the Islamic Conference 
in Khartoum not to adopt hard-line positions against the West 
and Israel. 
  Khartoum's attempt to move closer to Paris is attributable 
to 
the Sudanese belief that France is seeking to open a dialogue 
with some of the "isolated regimes," including Iran and Iraq. 
  But the French sources said that "no wants to buy what Sudan 
is offering." Khartoum's recent initiatives have led to a state 
of coolness in relations with Tehran. Late last year Iranian 
media services described al-Turabi's attempt to mediate in 
Afghanistan as "suspicious." Tehran turned down al-Turabi's 
request to visit it to discuss Afghanistan, so the mediation 
failed before it began. Western analysts say that recent 
Sudanese moves are linked with the deterioration of economic 
conditions and the Sudanese leadership's hopes of neutralizing 
the West while the Sudanese Army prepares to launch large-scale 
new military operations in the south.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 27 January 
issue of Cairo AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH summarizes articles that 
are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  University Board Now Islamically Run </H5>
  Candidates from the "Islamic current" have reportedly won 
all 
the seats on the board of directors of the Suez Canal 
University's Teaching Club. Names of the winning professors and 
the number of votes they obtained are cited in a 400-word 
front-page report. Dr. Muhammad Abazah, head of the Alexandria 
University Teaching Club, said that the Ministry of Social 
Affairs is stalling on setting a date for new elections at the 
club because opinion polls tip in favor of the Islamic current 
candidates. 
<H5>  Anti-Islamic Books To Be "Confiscated" </H5>
  A "responsible source" at al-Azhar Islamic Research Academy 
reportedly stressed that "all publications on display at the 
Cairo Book Fair will be scrutinized by the Academy's Composition 
and Translation Committee and that any written works containing 
ideas that conflict with our Islamic culture will be 
confiscated." The source also emphasized that "the grand imam 
of al-Azhar has ordered banning from the fair and confiscating 
all books published by the Ministry of Culture, supervised by 
the Book Authority, that contain ideas conflicting with Islam." 
The source added that "all pavilions at the fair will be 
supervised by the Composition and Translation Committee" and 
pointed out that "the campaign against the Islamic Research 
Academy launched by secular weekly magazines will not dissuade 
al-Azhar from combating the stray ideas promoted by the 
advocates of secularism and communism in Egypt." 
<H5>  Ministry, Book Fair Literature Criticized </H5>
  People's Assembly deputy Jalal Gharib has reportedly filed a 
new request for a briefing by Culture Minister Faruq Husni on 
the ministry's publications and periodicals, which he said 
contain material "that defames the prophets and divine nature" 
as well as "poetry that runs contrary to society's public 
ethics." He also protested the festivals organized by the 
Ministry of Culture, which he said include performances by 
"nude" and "gay" actors and other shows that ridicule religious 
symbols in violation of the Constitution, which names Islam as 
the state's religion and the Islamic shari'ah as the "primary 
source of legislation." 
<H5>  West Accused of Attacking Islam </H5>
  Reporter Taha Khattab cited Dr. Jamal 'Abd- al-Hadi, a 
professor of Islamic history, saying that foreign experts, in 
cooperation with the education minister and a U.S. center for 
curricula development, are trying to "obliterate the Islamic 
identity" of students by undermining their sense of patriotism, 
distancing them from their creed, and making them loyal to the 
West. Dr. 'Abd-al-Hadi noted: "Whoever defends the Islamic 
identity is branded as extremist and a fanatic by the education 
minister, who has reassigned thousands of teachers to 
administrative positions without specific charges, only that 
they are religious." He concluded, saying: "It seems that the 
education minister is implementing the Protocols of Zion, which 
want education in the Islamic countries to be theoretical only." 
<H5>  ROSE AL-YUSUF "Practicing Terrorism" </H5>
  Chief Editor Mahmud 'Atiyah criticized the weekly ROSE 
AL-YUSUF, without naming it, for publishing secular and 
political "garbage," such as extracts from the book by the 
"apostate" Salman Rushdie (see nc1901121794). Addressing an 
unnamed "communist" writer in charge of a literary publication 
for his remarks on the writer Fahmi Huwaydi, 'Atiyah said: "You 
are practicing the worst kind of terrorism, for you indeed are a 
terrorist group of a dangerous type that must be eliminated by 
being discarded from among the sons of the homeland and the body 
of the nation, because your ideas belong in the garbage can." 
'Atiyah then criticized Culture Minister Faruq Husni for 
setting up a higher council for censorship, most of whose 
members are "secularists and communists, whose slogan is no to 
Islam, no to protecting religious and national ethics and 
values, and yes to permissiveness." 
<H5>  Islamic Shari'ah Advocated </H5>
  Dr. al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Miliji, secretary general of 
the Scientists Association, in an article entitled "The Fatal 
Error," contended that Third World governments are moving in a 
vicious circle because of a fatal error, namely, separating 
themselves from their people. Noting that Muslim people wish to 
apply Islamic shari'ah, he pointed out that the "governments in 
our countries mostly tend to follow a Western mentality, be it 
American or Russian." He added that these governments are so 
engrossed in this fatal error that they have become hostile to 
the desires and the creed of the nation and have made plans to 
fight religion and religious people. In conclusion, he noted 
that no social or political change could be brought about unless 
"free and fair elections" are held that could give real 
legitimacy to all the winning quarters. 
<H5>  Islamic Preacher's Ban Questioned </H5>
  Writer Dr. Faruq 'Abd-al-Salam asked: Why is Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Hamid Kishk, a famous Islamic preacher in a Cairo 
mosque, prevented from giving religious lessons, delivering the 
Friday prayers, and leading people to prayer. He claimed that 
there isn't one reasonable explanation for the authority's 
insistence on preventing Shaykh Kishk from doing his religious 
duty, although he is one of the ulema of al-Azhar and an 
articulate orator whose fame is known to Muslims worldwide. He 
further asked: "On what constitutional and legal basis in 
Egypt, the seat of al-Azhar, are people like Shaykh Kishk and 
Shaykh al-Mahallawi denied the right to speak and deliver 
sermons in God's house and public places, if, as you claim, 
Egypt is democratic and the oasis of democracy in the region?" 
He noteed that Shaykh Kishk's sermons are taped and broadcast 
against the authority's will in public squares, such as 
"Al-'Atabah Square." 
<H5>  Islamic Thinkers on Islam, Extremism </H5>
  Reporters Hani al-Mikkawi and Yasir al-Dukkan noted a recent 
seminar held at the Islamic Thinking Institution of the Islamic 
Education Society. Among the attendees were writer Fahmi 
Huwaydi, Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, and 
Islamic thinker Dr. Muhammad 'Imarah who spoke at the seminar on 
local and international Islamic affairs. Huwaydi is quoted 
referring to a cultural "crisis" in the country resulting from 
Israeli, American, and Western "infiltration of Egyptian 
universities and culture, while Islam is busy defending itself 
against attacks by various quarters." He continued: "We are 
living in a society the political orientation of which does not 
specify the enemy or the friend." While admitting that the 
"acts of violence" have harmed the "Islamic movement," Huwaydi 
called for the need to revert to an Islamic "point of reference" 
(marji'iyah) that truly expresses the requirements of the age. 
Asked about the gap between Islamists and secularists, he 
admitted that such a gap exists despite Egyptian society being 
Islamic, adding that had this been properly highlighted, the 
current dispute over Islamic shari'ah and Islamic penalties 
would not have existed. 
  Asked how sincere is the call for national dialogue, Huwaydi 
said: "The call for dialogue is a noble call and Muslims 
advocate dialogue. The broader the dialogue the more serious it 
is, since it will include all national forces that have a 
presence in the Egyptian community." But Huwaydi cautions that 
the dialogue may be a "trap" for the people or an opportunity 
for the people to merely "vent" their misgivings. Huwaydi added 
that although he sides with the Islamic movement, this does not 
mean that he supports violence, noting that the problem of 
violence is a "political, economic, and Islamic problem." He 
pointed out: "The Islamists are ready for dialogue despite the 
campaign of defamation waged against them in the press," adding: 
"We want the Islamic current to acquire its due legitimacy; we 
want Islam to enter various walks of life." He said the 
Islamists are a "genuine" party in this country and are entitled 
"to express themselves and their Islamic identity, which 
everybody must defend." He also said: "Supposing some factions 
of the Islamic trend have made mistakes, this does not justify 
the attack against the Islamic movement and Islam. The Islamic 
trend is not a group of angels, but human beings who react to 
reality." He noted that communists and secularists have various 
factions and asked: So why blame the Islamists for this? 
  Asked how violence could be handled, Huwaydi pointed out 
that 
the current "security" method is unsuitable. He asked that 
instead of branding these youngsters gangs of outlaws, "Why 
don't we say there is a political and economic problem that has 
resulted in frustration leading to despair?" Huwaydi added that 
some people are trying to widen the differences between the 
Islamists and the government. 
  Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali attributed the disarray in the 
Islamic world to the Islamic nation having abandoned the "book 
the teachings of which it was ordered to comply with." In harsh 
remarks against secularists, al-Ghazali claimed: "Cockroaches 
are filling the press with their secularism and lies." He adds: 
"These frogs and cockroaches, from the secular and leftist 
writers, are the reason for the defeat of this nation; they 
represent the ugly face of the Islamic nation. They try to 
undermine the Islamic trend and even side with those hostile to 
Islam." 
  Dr. 'Imarah said that the Islamic movement is standing alone 
to defend the Islamic nation in the face of the "Israeli enemy." 
Asked why Islamists declined to take part in debates at the Book 
Fair, he answered: "How could we have a debate about the 
Islamic movement with 'Adil Imam and Samihah Ayyub [Egyptian 
artists]? They asked us to debate with them."

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 1 February 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  Muslim, Christian Clerics Call For National Unity </H5>
  A 1,500-word report on page two by Ibrahim Nasr and Mustaf 
Yasin notes that mainstream Muslim and Christian clerics have 
issued a call for national unity. According to the report, a 
seminar on religious thinking and citizenship was held in the 
Anglican Church in Heliopolis attended by Awqaf Minister Dr. 
Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub, Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu-al-Majd, a former 
information minister and an "Islamic thinker," and Reverend 
Samu'il Habib, head of the Anglican community. 
  Minister Mahjub is cited saying: "Egypt has never known 
fanaticism or differentiated among its people on religious 
grounds." 
  Abu-al-Majd notes: "Egypt is at a crossroads, the same one 
facing the Arab and Islamic worlds." He elaborates on the 
vulnerability of the Egyptians, Arabs, Muslims, and Third World 
people following the collapse of the old world order and the 
rise of the "new international order" and recommends a return to 
religious values to achieve stability and strengthen the nation. 
  Rev. Habib offers 10,000 seedlings to "be planted around the 
al-Azhar mosque in affirmation of the unity of the people of 
Egypt and the cohesion of the nation's strands." He makes other 
charitable offers but is cited no further on any political or 
religious affair. 
<H5>  Writer Praises Muslim-Christian Seminar </H5>
  A 600-word "Ramadan is Blessed" column by Majid Salim on 
page 
10 hails the seminar of Muslim and Christian clerics and their 
call for national unity and denounces those who want Islam or 
religion to play a marginal role in society. Salim opens his 
columns with these words: "Divide religions and rule. This is 
the slogan raised by the heirs of communism and the negators of 
religion, those who want to drive religion into the sidelines 
and then cut it off completely on the pretext that it is merely 
a link between man and God and has nothing to do with relations 
among members of society." Salim then argues that the 
solidarity shown by Muslim and Christian clerics proves those 
"negators of religion" mistaken. 
<H5>  Seminar Emphasizes Religious Education </H5>
  'AQIDATI carries extensive reportage on its own "convoys" or 
religious seminars. A 5,000-word report by Mamduh al-'Ashri, 
Musa Hal, Nazih Fudah, and Mahmud Fudah across pages four and 
five records the proceedings of a seminar held at the Special 
Teachers College in Minyat al-Nasr. Most of the discussion is 
religious, although Chief Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf makes a 
reference to a particular threat to the country's future. He 
says: "I am confident that the hostile values [al-qiyam 
al-mu'adiyah] that do not want Islam to prosper or Egypt to 
stand on its feet know that Egypt's youths are the basis of its 
future, so they attempt to deal a fatal blow to those youths 
through drugs, sex, and extremism." He advises religious 
education as a way to educate the youth and revive the country's 
fortunes. 
<H5>  Forces of "Modern Islamic Trend" Outlined </H5>
  Islamic writer Muhammad 'Imarah dedicates his 900-word 
"Islamic Views" column on page seven to a discussion of "The 
Forces of the Modern Islamic Trend." He notes: "In the year 
1368 of the hegira, 1948, the Muslim Brotherhood group in Egypt 
entered its first, minor, crisis. In 1954, it entered its 
second, major, crisis." 
  'Imarah does not elaborate on the difference between the two 
crises, but he states that the crisis (not specified) "replaced 
conventional modes of thinking -- particularly among the youths 
-- with the mentality of tension. Among the ranks of those who 
lived through it, the crisis (not specified) created claws to 
protect the Islamic body. The feelings of anger, rejection, and 
protest found voice in the publication of "Milestone on the 
Road" by martyr Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966). This was followed by 
the emergence of factions shunning society and seeking to change 
it through violent means. These factions were united in judging 
Islamic societies, regimes, and governments as being atheist and 
pre-Islamic." 
  'Imarah adds that the trend for "rejection and anger and 
protest" spawned three strands: 
  The first strand, which 'Imarah dubs "the claws," is 
composed 
of those who believe in violence and jihad. 
  Another strand, which 'Imarah dubs "the brain," comprises 
those who call for reviving the Islamic tradition. This second 
or "traditionalist" strand began with Jamal al-Din al-Afghani 
(1838-1897) and focused on intellectual propagation. 
  A third strand, which is expressed in general popular anger, 
is what 'Imarah calls "the body." 
  'Imarah provides no further insight into the positions and 
tactics or future strategy and prospects of these strands and 
gives no examples of the main representatives of the three 
strands on today's Egyptian and Muslim scenes. 
<H5>  India's Treatment of Muslims in Kashmir Denounced </H5>
  Writer 'Adil Dayf dedicates a 300-word column on page 20 to 
denouncing the Indian Government for its harsh treatment of the 
Muslims in Kashmir. 
<H5>  Muslims in Germany in Need of More Mosques, Schools </H5>

  The only interview in this issue is with a German Muslim 
freelance journalist, Muhammad Haytham 'Ayyash. In the 
2,000-word interview on page 20, 'Ayyash notes that there are 
4.5 million Muslims, mostly from the Turkish community, living 
in Germany who can do with more mosques and schools.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is review of the 8 
February issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are 
Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  Sarajevo Highlighted </H5>
  In this issue, 'AQIDATI gives prominence to reports and 
commentaries on the front-page headline, "massacres of 
Sarajevo," and preparations for the advent of the month of 
Ramadan. Chairman of the Board of Directors Samir Rajab wrote 
in a 400-word article on page 1 that what is happening in Bosnia 
is a source of shame for every Muslim. He pointed out that the 
"massacres of bloody Saturday could recur at any time, so long 
as this passiveness and indifference remain." He urged Muslims 
to press their non-Muslims friends hard to undertake "positive 
mediation" in this regard. Details on religious lectures and 
seminars in mosques throughout the country during Ramadan are 
also prominently covered. 
<H5>  Chief Editor on Islam, Extremism </H5>
  Reporters Mahmud 'Ushb and Ahmad Sha'ban described a seminar 
organized by the "AQIDATI Convoy" in 'Ayn Shams and Shubra 
al-Khayman, two Cairo districts. Attendees included local and 
religious figures and al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, the newspaper's 
chief editor. Several figures spoke during the seminar on 
Islamic topics and answered questions from the audience. 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf noted that extremism is a "deviation from the 
middle ground" in any issue, noting that Islam is a "religion of 
moderation." Defining terrorism, 'Abd-al-Ra'uf said: 
"Terrorism is a crime of collective murder against society and 
cannot be justified by a dispute with the regime, a feud with 
the police, or a protest at reality." He noted that there are 
various ways to tackle terrorism and extremism. He added: 
"There is no question that terrorism must be confronted with 
firmness and strength and that we have to contain and isolate 
it. As for extremism, it must be confronted first through 
education at home, at school, in the mosque, at the youth center 
and cultural center, and in the mass media." 
  'Abd-al- Ra'uf said on the subject of Islam's view on 
newspapers and magazines publishing "obscene" pictures of 
actresses: "There is no doubt that the scenes of nudity we see 
published on some books and magazines as well as in movie 
advertisements in the streets are not acceptable to God, His 
prophet, or any Muslim who is zealous about his religion." 
<H5>  Conspiracy Against al-Azhar Claimed </H5>
  Writer Basyuni al-Halawani charged that there is a 
"conspiracy" to undermine the role of al-Azhar. He criticized 
the BBC for airing a program on the fabricated "battle" between 
some Egyptian intellectuals and al-Azhar. 
<H5>  Banned Books Reportedly Distributed </H5>
  Columnist Majdi Salim, writing on the Cairo Book Fair, noted 
that among the thousands of books on display at the fair, the 
Book Authority has deliberately offered books that are banned 
from being displayed and distributed by law at the 
recommendation of al-Azhar. He also noted that the law has 
authorized al-Azhar to ban any book that may be offensive to 
Islam or public ethics, but the Book Authority "ignored" the law 
and distributed banned books. He emphasized the need to uphold 
the law, which he said is "our first and last weapon." 
<H5>  Promoting Islam in Media Praised </H5>
  Reporter Mamduh al-'Ashri praised Information Minister 
Safwat 
al-Sharif for not going along with the call to cancel television 
"censorship" under claims of "enlightenment and innovation." He 
noted that this proves that the minister knows that the main 
object of the "cultural invasion" to which the country is 
subjected is to "destroy" Egypt's youth. He also gave credit to 
the minister for his call to "intensify religious programs" on 
television, noting that only channel 2 heeded the minister's 
call and doubled the "dose of religious material," while 
channels 1 and 3 did not. 
<H5>  Islamic "Convoys" Resume </H5>
  Reporter Tariq 'Abdallah noted that al-Azhar University's 
"convoys of religious and health orientation" have started their 
activity throughout the republic. One of the convoys, made up of 
students from al-Azhar and doctors from al-Azhar University 
Hospital, has visited a village in al- Qalyubiyah Governorate. 
Dr. 'Ali Mi'bid, professor of philosophy at Usul al-Din 
college, was quoted, saying that the purpose of the convoy is to 
"combat the corrupt and devious ideas through holding seminars 
and competitions" attended by village youth. The convoy's 
activities include treatment of patients and orientation in the 
field of public hygiene, arranging for lessons and seminars on 
religious enlightenment at the village mosques, organizing 
competitions on Koranic and Islamic cultural subjects, and 
distributing free medicine to the needy villagers. 
<H5>  U.S. Anti-Islam Campaign Alleged </H5>
  An unattributed report examined a U.S. media campaign 
against 
Islam and Muslims. It said: "Political and media studies, 
recently conducted by several Islamic institutions in the United 
States, have affirmed that the fierce campaign that the media 
has been launching for a long time against Islam and the Muslims 
have caused the majority of the U.S. public to form a distorted 
picture of Islam and Muslims." A report prepared by the 
"American Islamic Center" showed how the U.S. media treatment of 
specific issues tends to exploit these issues to distort the 
image of Islam. A specific example given in the study refered 
to the media treatment of the bombing of the World Trade Center 
in New York. It noted that all reports and analyses on the 
story had one object in mind; namely, "To convince citizens that 
Islam is a religion of terrorism and that Muslims are 
necessarily terrorists." The same study pointed out that the 
U.S. media advances Islam, rather than Communism, as the West's 
"enemy" and that Islam is the "green danger that has replaced 
the red danger." The study added that a cover of "THE NEW 
YORKER" showed a picture of an Arab boy destroying a city, thus 
giving the impression that "Muslims are destructive." 
  The study also refered to the cartoon movie "Aladdin," which 
"presented a monstrous image of Islam and Muslims with the 
purpose of implanting it in the minds of U.S. children." The 
report concluded, saying: "Despite this gloomy picture, there 
are several indicators that promise a change in the way Islam 
and Muslims will be viewed in the future. This is what makes 
the American Muslims, who number more than 6 million, pin high 
hopes on Islamic countries and organizations to prepare an 
organized and constant plan to present the real image of the 
noble religion and those who believe in it to the American 
people." 
<H5>  Statistics on American Muslims </H5>
  An unattributed report cited statistics by an American 
Islamic institute as saying that 11,000 American citizens 
convert to Islam every year and that the number of Muslims in 
the United States has reached 5 million. 
<H5>  West "Lacks Will" on Bosnia Issue </H5>
  Columnist 'Adil Dayf refered to U.S. President Clinton's 
notion that the international community lacks the will to stop 
the fighting in Bosnia and that neither NATO nor the UN 
secretary general has any desire to use NATO's air power to 
resolve the crisis. He noted that Clinton's remarks reflect the 
"international connivance" toward the plight of Muslims in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. He urged Muslims to unify their efforts to 
resolve the Bosnian problem instead of waiting for international 
efforts that will lead to nothing, in view of the "obvious and 
blatant international connivance." 
<H5>  West's Reporting on Extremism "Exaggerated" </H5>
  Chief Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf crticized the Western 
media's "extreme and uncalled for" exaggeration in reporting on 
the terrorist incidents in Egypt. He noted that the media 
reports "ignore all the facts that policemen and culprits are 
more often killed and injured in these incidents than civilians" 
and that "the percentage of foreigners who become victims is 
negligible." He added: "This media exaggerates its reports on 
political Islam and Islamic fundamentalists on the premise that 
political Islam seeks to achieve power and topple regimes by 
force." He continued: "We have condemned and continue to 
condemn and reject terrorism and refuse to accept murder, 
terror, and sabotage as means and methods for dialogue and 
reform." He added: "But in the meantime, what these media 
organs are doing must be condemned, first because it seeks to 
undermine Islam by distorting its image and linking it to 
violence and terrorism and, second, because it targets Egypt as 
a symbol and center of power in the Arab countries and the 
Islamic world. And if we realize that Zionism is controlling 
many of these media organs, whether in the form of individual 
ownership or ownership by major corporations, we could 
understand the motives for these malicious campaigns." In 
conclusion, 'Abd-al-Ra'uf hoped that the "voices of reason" 
coming from British Crown Prince Charles and German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and the "complimentary" remarks made by President 
Clinton represent a moderate current of dealing with Islam, 
noting the need to "develop" this current.

<F P=106> ["Opinion" column: "Unity of Iraqi Territories" by Dr. 'Abd </F>
al-Karim 'Abd al-Samad] 
  [Text] The tripartite meeting of the foreign ministers of 
Syria, Iran, and Turkey that concluded its work yesterday in 
Istanbul falls within the three countries' joint coordination 
effort for the sake of bolstering security, peace, and stability 
in the region. The meeting is a followup to previous efforts 
that were crystallized at the Tehran meeting of 7 June 1993, 
which produced important positive results strengthenbing 
cooperation and mutual understanding and tackling conditions in 
the border areas with Iraq. 
  In this regard, the conferees attached special importance to 
the situation in northern and southern Iraq, affirming their 
countries' commitment to the unity and safety of Iraqi 
territories for the sake of the region's peace and stability, 
and also in order to get rid of the negative effects of the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which not only caused great damage to 
Iraq and Kuwait, but also adversely affected neighboring 
countries. 
  Iraq, including both the northern and southern parts, is 
still going through an anomalous, unstable situation due to its 
invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent burdens -- hence the call 
of the foreign ministers of the three countries urging the Iraqi 
Government to cancel all restrictions and measures against Iraqi 
citizens, which would help the return to a normal situation of 
security, stability, and peace. It would also help foil all 
plans and efforts to divide Iraq and disintegrate its unity. 
  It is understood that the unity of Iraqi territories and the 
necessity to safeguard it from any divisions or disintegration 
constitute a major factor, in fact, an indispensable condition, 
for the security, peace, and stability of the region as well as 
the unity of Iraqi territories. Above all, it is a national and 
pan- Arab necessity dictated by the interests of the Iraqi 
people and the entire Arab nation. Disintegration or division, 
as often affirmed by Syria, has never been the method to resolve 
any problem no matter how complicated on the regional level. 
  Therefore, the Iraqi people, despite all the circumstances 
they are going through, are called upon to affirm the unity and 
integrity of their territories. This is a general popular 
desire on Iraqi, Arab, and regional levels. As noted in the 
statement issued by the Istanbul meeting, the future of Iraq 
will be determined by the free will of the Iraqis on the basis 
of equality, democracy, and good neighborly relations.

  [Text] Editorializing on the Washington talks, TISHRIN 
says: The bilateral talks between the heads of delegations are 
due to resume in Washington tomorrow. The talks were suspended 
for one week at the request of the Israeli side to hold 
consultations with its government. The nature of these 
consultations and their results are still not clear. However, 
it is clear that Israel recessed the peace talks in order to 
cover up its intransigent, maneuvering stands. Israel also 
wants to prolong these talks to give the impression that it is 
serious about reaching ideas and views to discuss the question 
of peace and its requirements. 
  TISHRIN adds: Since the suspension of the talks, Israel has 
not said anything signaling that the Israeli side has come up 
with anything new or that it has changed its familiar stand and 
abandoned its conditions and obstacles. On the contrary, all 
indications are that Israel still adheres to everything that is 
far from achieving a just and comprehensive peace. Also, Israel 
is still committed to sabotaging the peace process. No Israeli 
official has said anything that inspires optimism and hope for 
real progress in the Washington talks. 
  TISHRIN goes on: Israel has cast doubt on the results of the 
talks even before they start. Several Israeli officials have 
said the talks will be unproductive, just like all the other 
previous rounds and sessions that have been revolving in a 
vicious circle since the Madrid conference. The only new thing 
that Israel has come up with is the old, familiar tune repeated 
by its Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres when he said: The talks 
between Syria and Israel should be upgraded. This discordant 
Israeli tune cannot fool anybody. Israel's previous discordant 
tune -- arguing that secret talks alone can produce positive 
results to advance the peace process -- could not fool anybody 
either. 
  The paper says the secret Oslo talks revealed that the aim 
Israel seeks behind the talks is to take on each Arab party on 
its own so that it can easily blackmail it and drive it to make 
more concessions. The purpose of this is to defeat the Madrid 
formula and evade its foundations and terms. 
  Since Syria is perfectly aware of Israel's malicious 
objectives and premeditated intentions, and stemming from a 
comprehensive pan- Arab perspective, Syria has firmly and 
proudly rejected Israeli suggestions and claims. Syria has 
asserted that the one who is concerned about peace would also be 
eager to maintain the foundations on which the peace process was 
launched, particularly in terms of a comprehensive solution, 
clear position, just cause, and that peace is impossible along 
with occupation, not even some or part of this occupation. This 
is because peace can only be achieved through real, serious 
implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  TISHRIN concludes: There can be no peace without the Arabs 
regaining their territories in full. This will enable the 
region to start an age of stability and prosperity, end tension, 
explosions, disasters, wars, and calamities. 
  Under the headline "Partial Solutions Are Not the 
Alternative," AL-BA'TH says: The bilateral peace talks are 
expected to resume in Washington tomorrow amid an atmosphere 
that does not inspire optimism. Israel has once again attempted 
to reshuffle cards in line with its rejection of peace and its 
policy to take on the Arab parties one at a time, resulting in 
the Oslo and Cairo accords. 
  AL-BA'TH adds that this policy aims at fragmenting the 
Palestine question, in fact the Arab-Israeli conflict, to impose 
surrender on the Arabs and Zionist hegemony on the region. 
Israel has found a party that responds to it by making endless 
concessions. This encouraged the Rabin government to show more 
intransigence whenever it achieves a breakthrough that serves 
its purposes. The best evidence of this is Israel's demand that 
representation on the Syrian track be upgraded, or else 
emphasizing that it has no wish to go any further on this track. 
  This position, though old, has come on the heels of the 
Cairo 
agreement. We do not know what new position the Rabin 
government will come up with after whatever agreement. This is 
because the talks between Israel and the party that claims to be 
representing the Palestinian people are not over yet. The two 
parties need a series of agreements to implement the Oslo accord 
of capitulation. 
  AL-BA'TH adds that Israel is still deliberately seeking to 
steer clear of the principles that call for a just and 
comprehensive solution in the region. This approach, with all 
its attempts to reshuffle cards, is impossible to continue 
forever, since a just and comprehensive peace is an 
international demand, as well as a regional and Arab demand.

  [Excerpts] Robert Urbain, Belgium's foreign trade minister, 
visited Damascus from 24 to 26 January. On the sidelines of the 
visit, TISHRIN held a lengthy interview with Urbain in which he 
responded to the editor's questions on Syrian-Belgian relations 
and prospects for developing them. [passage omitted] 
  Urbain said: I would like to note that my visit to Syria 
came a bit later than scheduled. The visit was supposed to take 
place at the end of last year, but we had to postpone it until 
the beginning of this year due to my heavy schedule. 
  The visit seeks to bolster bilateral relations and increase 
cooperation to serve common interests. We will analyze and 
evaluate the current status of bilateral relations and see how 
they have been developing, especialzly now that there is peace 
process in the region. 
  Urbain added: I believe that although the level of bilateral 
relations is not great, it is constant. Our exports to Syria 
totaled $100 million. Our exports included food products, 
minerals, and chemical substances. Meanwhile, our imports from 
Syria totaled $12 million. Foremost among these imports were 
textiles and oil. 
  I would like to note that proceeding from this fact and in 
light of the positive developments in the Syrian 
economy--especially after the issuance of a law to promote 
investment--and the growing role of the private sector, Belgian 
businessmen and project owners are willing to establish 
cooperation relations with Syria. 
  We, in the Belgian-Luxembourg union [as published], support 
Belgian companies' participation in joint projects with Syria. 
  On the level of cooperation between the two governments, 
Urbain said: We are highly concerned with the priorities of the 
Syrian authorities in terms of what Belgium can offer as far as 
implementing infrastructure projects, including electricity 
projects. 
  We will soon sign an agreement for technical, economic, and 
technological cooperation. I would like to note that the 
signing of the agreement has been delayed for purely technical 
reasons, especially on Luxembourg's part. 
  We seek to sign an agreement between Syria and the 
Belgian-Luxembourg union to encourage and protect investments on 
both sides. I believe there is a need to sign such an agreement. 
  Urbain continued: Belgium is a member of the European Union 
[EU]. Cooperation between Syria and the EU is the framework 
that defines Belgium's relations with Syria. Syria and the EU 
have signed several agreements. In 1977, a third protocol for 
technical and financial cooperation, amounting to 146 million 
European Currency Units [ECU], was signed with the EC. In 1992, 
a fourth protocol, amounting to 158 ECU's, was signed. The 
protocol includes technical and financial aid to support the 
Syrian Government's efforts in the energy and health sectors, as 
well as other infrastructure projects. It also includes grants 
to prepare and train cadres. 
  On prospects for promoting future relations between the two 
countries, Urbain said: I believe that trade relations are a 
question of needs and requirements. We are ready to help Syria 
export more commodities to the EU states. The EU is a very 
large market with a population of over 340 million. It is 
important to promote relations between the two countries and to 
provide an appropriate atmosphere for that purpose. The 
nonexistence of Belgian investments in Syria is linked to this 
issue. Therefore, I raised the need for signing a bilateral 
agreement to protect and encourage investment. 
  He added: There are broad investment fields in Syria. The 
Syrian Government's measures are useful. I hope that these 
measures will be enforced. We hope the peace process will 
reflect positively on the regional states. I would like to 
point out that the EU called for the implementation of UN 
Resolutions 242 and 338 on the Middle East. It also supported 
the principle of land for peace. 
  Urbain continued: The international interest in peace in the 
region and the international community's will to establish peace 
in the Middle East have been greatly boosted by the outcome of 
the very important meeting between Presidents al-Asad and 
Clinton in Geneva. That meeting gave peace efforts a new 
momentum. 
  Before moving to discuss the problems facing some Belgian 
cabinet members, Urbain stressed that Belgium will present 
specific proposals to bolster cooperation between the financial 
and monetary institutions in both countries. He expressed the 
Belgian Government's readiness to organize seminars in Belgium 
in cooperation with Syria to explain many economic issues about 
Syria and to increase the Syrian exports to the EU. [passage

  [Text] Reacting to yesterday's attack against the Shin Bet 
men near Ramallah, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said this 
morning that Israel will take all the steps possible from the 
military and legal viewpoints to prevent attacks against Israeli 
civilians and security personnel without any relation to the 
peace talks and, at the same time, will pursue the political 
negotiations. Mr. Peres made these remarks to our political 
correspondent Shlomo Raz. 
  Minister Peres met with visiting French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe this morning. Following the meeting, the guest said 
that beginning next month, Israelis visiting France for short 
periods will not require visas. The two ministers also agreed 
on bilateral space research cooperation. It was also reported 
that Israel and France will tighten their political and military 
relations, especially in the research sphere.

  [Text] The French defense minister is also slated to 
arrive in Israel next month. This was reported during the 
meeting between French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin a short while ago in Jerusalem. Rabin 
thanked the French minister for approving the European mandate 
for negotiations on updating the economic agreement between the 
EC and Israel. Rabin also thanked Juppe for canceling the need 
for entry visas for Israelis visiting France. 
  Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports that Rabin and 
the French foreign minister discussed developments in the peace 
talks, and Mr. Juppe disclosed that France is trying to promote 
the establishment of a television station in the territories. 
Rabin said that Israel would agree to the establishment of a 
Palestinian television station only within the context of a full 
agreement with the Palestinians on Gaza-Jericho First.

repeated that the NATO ultimatum was not a bluff: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] The NATO decision is not bluff. It 
is a real ultimatum, and it is up to the UN Protection Force 
command to tell us when the ultimatum expires, whether the 
alliance demands -- which were drawn up in narrow consultation 
with the UN secretary- general -- are met or not. If they are 
not met, then we will have to draw the conclusions. In other 
words, we will have to destroy the artillery positions that have 
not been pulled back. If the demands are met, then all the 
best. You know, I have kept repeating -- when I was in Zagreb, 
in Sarajevo -- that there is no lasting solution other than a 
diplomatic and political one. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Rousselin: "Alain Juppe in the Middle </F>
East -- Israel: France's Contribution to Extensive Peace"] 
  [Text] Traditionally a friend of the [French] Socialists, 
Israel's Labor government seems more comfortable with a Gaullist 
at the helm of France's diplomacy. On Alain Juppe's arrival 
yesterday for his first official visit there, Jerusalem 
celebrated the markedly improved relations the two countries 
have enjoyed since the new French Government came into power. 
  Diplomacy is not immune from paradox -- and the bitter 
memories left by [former socialist foreign ministers] Claude 
Cheysson and Roland Dumas only serve to accentuate today's 
favorable climate. "This time we do not have to wonder what the 
minister is going to lecture us on," an Israeli diplomat told 
French correspondents yesterday. 
  Newspapers indicate that Alain Juppe was the first French 
foreign minister to come to the Israeli Embassy for the 
Independence celebrations -- in May 1993 -- since the Six Day 
War. A symbolical gesture, but a welcome one. 
  In any event, since the Oslo agreement and the beginning of 
the dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat, a diplomatic "slip" has become 
unlikely. This is something the Israelis now do very well by 
themselves. For instance, new Labor Party Leader Nissim Zvili 
[name as published] has said that a Palestinian State is an 
unavoidable perspective, just like that of the Golan Heights 
being returned to Syria. 
  Before leaving Jordan, Alain Juppe simply stated on Israeli 
television that "meeting the deadlines" is a necessity if the 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is to be achieved: "It is 
important to prevent the peace process from getting bogged down: 
time is not on the side of those who want peace." 
  In Amman, as his contribution to a peace he wishes will be 
"extensive," the French foreign minister promised to push for a 
rescheduling of Jordan's debt at the meeting of Club de Paris 
creditors next month. 
<H5>  Perspectives </H5>
  With his Israeli and Palestinian partners, Mr. Juppe will 
strive to lay the groundwork for France's contribution to the 
peace process. Already very active within multilateral 
negotiations, Paris has agreed to head working groups on the 
economy, refugees, and water-related issues. As regards 
infrastructure projects, French firms try to position themselves 
in the perspective of an actual peace. 
  Mr. Juppe's visit takes place after the Cairo "breakthrough" 
on security, at a time when negotiations on the withdrawal from 
Gaza and Jericho have resumed in Taba, Egypt. On the agenda: 
the Palestinian police force and issues relating to water and 
electricity supply, as well as telecommunications and the 
Palestinian radio and television, a project in which France is a 
partner. 
  The Israelis hope that improved relations between the two 
countries will afford Mr. Juppe an opportunity to announce the 
lifting of the visa requirement imposed on Israeli citizens 
wishing to go to France since the 1986 terrorist bombings in 
Paris. This has not been facilitated by [Interior Minister] 
Charles Pasqua's decision to require exit visas from 
Palestinians leaving France, thus putting them in the same class 
as Iranians, Iraqis, Afghans, or Libyans. 
  The visit's highlight will take place tomorrow with Alain 
Juppe going to the Gaza strip, where he intends to visit the 
Chati [name as published] seaboard refugee camp. The first 
French foreign minister to go to Gaza, Mr. Juppe made it clear 
to [Police Affairs Minister] Shahal that he did not want to be 
escorted by jeeps. Consequently, he had to sign a letter 
releasing Israeli authorities from any responsibility as to his 
personal safety. "With the perspectives opened by the Gaza and 
Jericho agreement, we must show that the Gaza strip can be 
viable without an Israeli presence," French sources argue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's </F>
ambassador to the United States, by Drora Perl, in his 
Washington office `this week'] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Perl] How do you sum up 
your first year as Israel's ambassador to Washington, and how do 
you view the current situation compared to that of a year ago? 
  [Rabinovich] What is important is not that I have been in 
this post for a year, but that it is the first anniversary of 
the Clinton administration and Israel's relations with this 
administration. I prefer to look at it that way. 
  It was a very good year for these ties, springing from the 
administration's basically friendly approach and the 
understanding formed between the two states on the peace 
process. It is true that the understanding began in the final 
months of the Bush administration, but it could not find 
expression then because the administration was fighting 
unsuccessfully for its political life. 
  Another factor is the chemistry, or the good relations, 
between the President, the secretary of state, and other senior 
officials in the U.S. Administration, with Israeli leaders. It 
could perhaps be exemplified by the fact that when Foreign 
Minister Peres visited Washington last week he almost did not 
have to deal with bilateral issues, since these are being dealt 
with and their situation is fine. That is perhaps the best way 
to describe the relations at the end of the Clinton 
administration's first year in office. 
  [Perl] What bilateral issues are you referring to? 
  [Rabinovich] A year and a half ago there was confrontation 
over the loan guarantees and the aid was put into question. Up 
to several months ago there were still restrictions on 
technological cooperation between the two states, which did not 
permit us to compete in the U.S. market. The current situation 
is that we have received a package of aircraft -- F-14A's and 
F-16's -- following the prime minister's visit here in November, 
the refurbishing the Air Force's working fleet, the replacement 
of its spearhead, and I can go on and on. 
  [Perl] Can we say that the main contributing factor is the 
presence of a sympathetic administration which is ideologically 
closer to the present Israeli Government, or to the existence of 
the peace process, or to some combination of the two? 
  [Rabinovich] It is a symbiotic process in which the basic 
sympathy and common outlook on the peace process and the fact 
that the Middle East is viewed as one of the areas of success 
for the administration's foreign policy, are all aspects which 
feed on each other. You can perform an intellectual exercise 
and try to give more importance to one of the elements at the 
expense of the others, but I do not see any point in it. 
  [Perl] Is there a single component within the framework of 
relations that makes up the backbone, and if it becomes 
problematic then the entire system becomes problematic? 
  [Rabinovich] No, I think that one of the secrets of the 
success of the special relationship between the United States 
and Israel is that it is a basket containing various things, so 
that even when part of the system does not function properly at 
various times, it manages to survive thanks to its other parts. 
There were times when the Pentagon or the White House were 
friendlier than the State Department or the other way around, 
and there were times that Congress was considered Israel's 
safety net in the bilateral ties. The Jewish community is, of 
course, a permanent asset. The international situation keeps 
changing. In the '50's, for example, at the peak of the Cold 
War, Israel was considered a burden. During the late '60's and 
'70's it was an asset. Every time there was a dominant element 
and other elements which had an impact on relations. That is 
one of the secret of their charm. 
  [Perl] Assuming he is confirmed as deputy secretary of 
state, how do you see Strobe Talbott's role in the peace process 
and relations with Israel in view of the initial jarring notes 
concerning his nomination? 
  [Rabinovich] His position (to date he has been the State 
Department's ambassador-at-large for Russia and the former 
Soviet republics -- author's note) should be given the same 
importance that is attached to the role Dennis Ross plays in our 
region. Talbott was successful in his job as a regional expert, 
and a man who has been successful in one region should be 
expected to do the same in another region or in another job. I 
expect Dennis Ross to continue playing a leading and decisive 
role in the Middle East, while Talbott sees to general 
organizational and policy matters in the State Department, not 
necessarily pertaining to the Middle East. 
  Clearly, the deputy secretary of state will also deal with 
the Middle East, which is a key issue in the administration's 
foreign policy. However, I believe that Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and Special Ambassador Dennis Ross will 
continue to do most of the work in this region. 
  I do not want to make any personal comments about Talbott, 
who is in the midst of a hearing and confirmation process. 
However, I can say that our paths crossed in the year that he 
has been doing this job and our work together was very pleasant 
and effective. 
  [Perl] Upon assuming office, the Clinton administration 
described its role in the peace process as that of a "honest 
broker" or a "full partner." The description has not changed, 
but the substance has. First there was an attempt to terminate 
the separate rounds of negotiations in Washington and treat the 
talks as one package, and now we are back to rounds of talks. 
The latest round was held on the level of delegation heads and 
as far away from the media as possible. The Americans were seen 
working behind the scenes. Has the administration's role 
changed and, if so, how? 
  [Rabinovich] Obviously, the role changed because the process 
and circumstances changed. Clearly, after the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles in Oslo and the ceremony in Washington 
the peace process is not what it was before. 
  Looking back, the members of the peace team did a lot of 
work 
on the Palestinian track last spring in Washington. Some of 
this work contributed to the success in Oslo. Oslo cannot be 
explained without Washington. The situation has changed because 
the main talks on the Palestinian track are being held elsewhere. 
  The administration does not get involved because it does not 
want to become an arbiter between the Palestinians and us. 
However, both sides update the administration and keep it in 
the picture. 
  The administration is more active today on the Syrian track 
than on the Palestinian one. As the peace process makes headway 
and agreements are attained, I expect there will be other 
developments and work procedures will change. 
  Indeed, the administration is no less involved today. The 
President himself became involved in the Syrian track when he 
met al-Asad in Geneva. 
  [Perl] The Americans submitted their own draft proposals on 
the Palestinian track. Should we expect them to do the same on 
the Syrian track? 
  [Rabinovich] They did that only when the sides solicited it. 
We do not yet need it at this point, and the Americans will 
definitely will not impose themselves by submitting compromise 
proposals. [passage omitted] 
  [Perl] During his visit here last week, Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres mentioned for the first time that in view of "the 
exorbitatnt price" the Syrians are demanding for peace, he 
expects them to bring most of the Arab world into the circle of 
reconciliation with Israel. Is this a new element in the 
negotiations with the Syrians? 
  [Rabinovich] It is not a new element, but a new emphasis; by 
way of making the best of a bad deal. In other words, if the 
Syrians claim they are the key to a comprehensive agreement and 
if they claim, quite justifiably, that they have influence over 
other countries, a breakthrough with Syria should be expected to 
lead to a reconciliation or to peace with most of the Arab world. 
  The Americans will definitely want to be involved in such a 
process. They know about this idea, they think it is an 
excellent one, and they will be happy to help. 
  [Perl] Has it been raised in the talks with the Syrians? 
  [Rabinovich] Not yet. 
  [Perl] Has al-'Allaf heard about it? 
  [Rabinovich] He most certainly has, seeing that it was 
voiced publicly. However, it is too early to discuss it. We 
will be able to discuss it in a more concrete manner when we are 
closer to attaining an agreement. [passage omitted] 
  [Perl] Vice President Al Gore termed the meeting between 
Clinton and al-Asad "a huge breakthrough." Dennis Ross said 
this week that it was not a breakthrough but only "a beginning." 
What caused the "amendment" of the U.S. assessment? 
  [Rabinovich] I believe perspective is a wonderful tool. Now 
everybody sees Geneva in a different perspective. 
  [Perl] Was the reassessment caused by the death of al-Asad's 
son, owing to the fact that it may have held up developments in 
the aftermath of the meeting? 
  [Rabinovich] I do not think Basil's death changed the way in 
which the Geneva meeting is seen. The effect of this 
development cannot yet be assessed by anybody. 
  In the meantime, we have discussed the Geneva meeting with 
the Americans. It is no secret that we were less enthusiastic 
about it than the Americans. Now, with a perspective of three 
weeks, they see it as the beginning of something rather than as 
the middle or end of something. 
  [Perl] The negotiations resume next Tuesday. What can we 
expect in the 13th round of talks with the Syrians? 
  [Rabinovich] President Clinton stated this week that Syria 
must demonstrate its willingness and the seriousness of its 
intentions with regard to peace with Israel. He was referring 
to the so-called public diplomacy which should be part of the 
negotiations. 
  The fact that the President made such a statement definitely 
carries weight. The Syrians are not indifferent to what the 
Americans say. 
  I definitely do not live with a sense of urgency. The 
Syrians must elaborate on their position concerning the two 
issues currently on the agenda: the security arrangements and 
the time factor. 
  [Perl] In short, how would you sum up this past year and 
what do you yourself wish for your second year? 
  [Rabinovich] I end this year with a good feeling. We made 
many small steps as well as a major breakthrough. I would like 
to see another major breakthrough this coming year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander </F>
of the Northern Command, by Arye Kiesel; place and date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Mordekhay] Hizballah is 
not an invincible enemy. It must be understood that the terrain 
is hilly. Hizballah men come out of the villages on roads we 
are not watching. They cross mountains, river beds, rocks, and 
come within dozens of meters of our troops. They make use of 
the poor visibility and rough terrain, and the result on our end 
is painful. We have a problem with pinpointing intelligence on 
them, and we do not always have answers or information when they 
go on an operation, from where, and their goals. 
  [Kiesel] Does that mean that we will have to live with the 
harsh reality of having victims? 
  [Mordekhay] No. Their method of operation presents a 
difficulty. This is a type of guerrilla that comes out of areas 
that are not under our control, from civilian terrain of which 
they make full use. We will find ways and methods to hurt them. 
Last year, we carried out thousands of operations that proved 
themselves. 
  We are dealing with 130 km of a very hilly border. It is not 
all that simple. Hizballah does not have any bases or training 
sites. They work out of mosques and from inside a civilian 
population that is often held hostage. We cannot harm the 
population, but we will find ways to hurt Hizballah. 
  Compared with events in the security zone, one must remember 
that the our northern settlements live in full security. Not a 
single katyusha has been fired at the north since July. 
Furthermore, all attempts by terror squads to reach the border 
fence or get near it have been thwarted. 
  Last year was very painful for Hizballah. They suffered 126 
fatalities from our activity -- the highest figure ever -- and 
there are certainly more fatalities and casualties we do not 
know of. 
  [Kiesel] Is a war being waged in south Lebanon? 
  [Mordekhay] I never said that. There is a confrontation, 
there are battles, clashes, and exchanges of fire. I do not 
call this war. Anyone who wants to extend the definition of war 
or call it that is welcome to do so. War has certain 
characteristics which are not present here. In the security 
zone, we are constantly dealing with the situation. 
  [Kiesel] The deputy chief of staff called it war. 
  [Mordekhay] I know what the chief of staff and his deputy 
mean. They do not mean war in the broad sense of the word, 
where both parties employ their full forces; we certainly do 
not. There are exchanges of fire, clashes, and casualties. 
There are daily incidents. In a war you use all the means 
available to win. 
  [Kiesel] Does last week's incident in which four soldiers 
were killed and five injured in a Hizballah ambush indicate an 
escalation? 
  [Mordekhay] There has been a significant escalation in 
Hizballah activity over the past two weeks. They have been 
planting bombs and shooting antitank and Sagger missiles. The 
political process has an impact on Hizballah. It fears that the 
process with Syria is making progress, and that this would 
reduce their freedom of operation in the future, hence they are 
trying to demonstrate their force. When their activity dropped, 
they encountered pressure to resume activity. Also, without 
doubt, they are seriously influenced by the unprecedented scope 
of their recent arms and equipment procurements. 
  [Kiesel] Does the equipment come from Iran? 
  [Mordekhay] Absolutely. Iran sent dozens of Sagger missiles 
and hundreds of mortar bombs, as well as many other means, 
backing, money, guidance, and training, which led to a 
significant escalation. 
  [Kiesel] Does this mean that they have surprisingly 
recovered from Operation Accountability? 
  [Mordekhay] Absolutely. They suffered more than 100 
fatalities last year, but they filled out the ranks with new 
recruits. A vacuum was created after Operation Accountability. 
Lebanese residents called on the government to send in the army, 
to help. The Lebanese Government tried to send in a battalion, 
but the Syrians prevented it from taking steps against 
Hizballah. As a result, Hizballah gained strength, started 
rebuilding itself, and -- enjoying an incredible cash flow from 
Iran -- in fact, strengthened its hold in the villages. Until 
Syria allows the Lebanese Government to deploy its Army freely 
in south Lebanon, Hizballah will have a good time. 
  [Kiesel] How deep is Hizballah-Iran cooperation? 
  [Mordekhay] Very deep and very tight. We know they are 
exchanging information, training, and advice. The Hizballah 
leadership travels to Iran for guidance, explanations, and 
ideas. They do not go there for vacation or to visit massage 
parlors, but to be trained. 
  [Kiesel] Your description indicates that the terror attacks 
cannot be prevented. 
  [Mordekhay] They can be reduced, but not totally eliminated. 
Our activity, in most cases, aims to reduce their freedom of 
operation and make them pay a price before they reach their 
goal, before leaving a base, or during contact with them. In 
the vast majority of the incidents we do manage to hit them from 
a distance. 
  [Kiesel] Why is the Air Force not employed to prevent 
ambushes such as happened last week? 
  [Mordekhay] The Air Force has its limitations, it cannot 
discover such ambushes. We use Air Force assault helicopters 
against specific targets. I do not believe, however, that the 
Air Force can significantly change the state of affairs here. 
  [Kiesel] Do you not feel that in fighting Hizballah the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] has its hands tied for fear a 
retaliation of katyushas could be fired at the northern 
settlements? 
  [Mordekhay] Absolutely not. No one has tied our hands. The 
political guidance we receive is very clear to us. We are 
serious people. We do consider the implications of our activity 
on the settlements of the north. We saw what happened when the 
situation deteriorated and they were hurt. [passage omitted] 
  [Kiesel] Do you believe that, once we reach agreement with 
them, the Syrians will curb Hizballah and discipline them? 
  [Mordekhay] I have no doubt about this. If Syria used its 
influence, it could significantly reduce the Hizballah military 
operability. It could stop the transfer of means to them. It 
could allow the Lebanese Army to deploy there. The Lebanese 
Army has done that throughout Lebanon, but has not lifted a 
finger in the areas adjacent to the security zone. 
  Syria is a key player. Syria acting the innocent last week 
and saying that it does not take part in Hizballah activity is 
not acceptable to us. Acting naive like this is unbecoming of a 
rattlesnake, not even one that breeds in Damascus. Had it 
wanted to, Syria could curb and significantly stop Hizballah. 
It is a question of a Syrian decision. If they wanted, the 
Lebanese Army could be stationed there, and it could cooperate 
with the IDF in dealing with Hizballah, removing them from the 
villages, and closing down the military supplies routes from 
Iran. 
  [Kiesel] Do you know for certain of a terror act that the 
Syrians knew of in advance? 
  [Mordekhay] We cannot establish a direct link between a 
Syrian order or instruction and a terror act; the connection is 
merely circumstantial. Yet, Hizballah would like to fire 
katyushas at Israel, but it does not dare because it understands 
there are agreements which should not be deviated from. What 
reason did they have to abstain from activity for 10 days during 
the Clinton-al-Asad summit? These were the quietest days I can 
recall. There is a hand that guides Hizballah, and it comes 
from Syria. 
  [Kiesel] Do you believe al-Asad aims for peace? 
  [Mordekhay] Al-Asad understands the international and Middle 
Eastern strategic situation. At the same time, al-Asad has in 
no way dropped the military option. Along with conducting the 
political process, the Syrian military buildup continues. I 
believe al-Asad wants to attain Syrian interests and national 
goals in peaceful ways. If he fails, all options are open. 
  [Kiesel] The Intelligence Branch appreciates he wants peace. 
Major General 'Uzi Dayan, however, said that if the political 
process gets stuck, a limited military operation is to be 
expected in 1994. What do you think? 
  [Mordekhay] I would not put a time frame on this, not even 
in terms of years. A process starts and no one knows when it 
will end or where it will leads. It must be understood that the 
other option -- the military option -- exists on the level of 
the ability in the field and on the conceptual level. When will 
it be used? When someone feels there is no other way. 
  [Kiesel] Do you mean that you do not rule out a Syrian 
military move, should all other options fail? 
  [Mordekhay] Our working assumption should be very clear: 
Syria is able to do it. The question is when. Knowing the IDF 
and Northern Command's power, I would urge him to think twice 
before making a move of a military nature. I believe he is 
aware of this. We have the power, and we have proved we will use 
it against anyone who tries to put our existence at risk. 
  [Kiesel] Has the Northern Command been asked to prepare 
withdrawal or redeployment plans for the Golan Heights? 
  [Mordekhay] No. No one in the command, including mys?lf, is 
engaged in any plans that have political bearings. All of the 
plans I deal with, all the preparations, are within the scope of 
providing an answer in case someone does something, God forbid. 
Nothing else is happening in the Northern Command. 
  [Kiesel] If Syria means peace, would you recommend getting 
off the Golan Heights? 
  [Mordekhay] This is a political issue. I believe a military 
man should not, and must not, comment on such issues. When the 
Israeli Government has thoughts and potential scenarios, it will 
apparently present them to the people in charge of the Army and 
the territory in the command. We will present our assessments 
then. The problem is that the Golan Heights is too small for 
waging a modern war and reducing damage. If the threat is 
eliminated, or if there is another threat, we will have to 
examine the meaning and make political decisions. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Nehama Doweq: "The Making of an Octet"] </F>
  [Text] It is 8:30 PM at the presidential suite of the 
Holiday Inn Hotel in Jerusalem. Resigning Health Minister Hayim 
Ramon is the first to arrive. Down at the reception they 
notified him that in view of the recent events and due to their 
sympathy for him, this time he will be awarded the presidential 
suite, room No. 2014. 
  The other members of his group slowly gather -- Avraham 
Burg, 
Hagay Merom, 'Amir Peretz, Ya'el Dayan, Nawaf Musaliha, Shmu'el 
Avital, and last and late as usual, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi 
Beilin. Ramon told them of the thousands of letters and cables 
that arrived at his office, and they all sat there basking in 
the light of his last, successful, trick. 
  As usual, Burg warns Dayan, Musaliha, and Avital that they 
may not smoke. This has become a ritual in their meetings: He 
makes a threat, and they cling to the balcony door and blow 
their smoke out to the Jerusalem skies. Burg pulls out his 
laptop computer on which he documents each of their meetings and 
they start talking. 
  This is a very tight gang. They are friends, and have 
similar ideas on both social and political issues. They have 
been together for years. This togetherness is the source of 
their power within Labor. They make up the only Labor circle 
that holds eight Knesset members, which can be a decisive factor 
in any of the Knesset faction decisions. 
  They also attract a lot of hatred and envy. One is a 
minister; two (Beilin and Musaliha) are deputy ministers; three 
of them chair Knesset committees -- Education and Culture 
(Burg), Labor and Social Welfare (Peretz), and the House 
Committee (Merom). Ya'el Dayan used to chair the subcommittee 
on women's rights. 
  The group has undergone changes. Once, it was made up of 17 
members; this was toward the end of 'Uzi Bar'am's term as Labor 
director general. Some of the group conspired against the 
establishment of a national unity government. The group broke 
up and a septet was created: Ramon, Beilin, Burg, Peretz, 
Musaliha, Nisim Zvili, and Merom. A clear and unequivocal 
political line held them together. The archrivals of today -- 
Ramon and Zvili -- were once brothers in arms. 
  The cutoff started when five of the six [as published] were 
elected to the Knesset while Zvili, who really did not want to, 
chose to stay with the Jewish Agency. Working at the Knesset, 
however, brought the five closer together, which began to cast a 
shadow on Zvili. Also, Ramon was chairman of the Labor faction 
and coalition whip, hence he was able to hand out benefits to 
the Knesset members -- mainly podium time. Zvili had nothing to 
offer. At the same time, Ramon began to be noticed and spoiled 
by the media. 
  Today, Hagay Merom says that all those years, until the 
absolute rift between them, it was clear that the group was 
headed by Ramon and Zvili. It was clear to all that someday, 
the two would face each other in the struggle over party 
leadership. Incidentally, Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer is not just 
waiting in the corner. Presently, he earnestly crisscrosses 
Israel, gaining incredible strength. 
  Burg, who, contrary to Ramon, did not hesitate to back Zvili 
in the struggle over the role of party director general, says: 
"Zvili is extremely talented. He never tells a lie. He keeps 
silent if he does not want to say something. Ramon, on the 
other hand, will tell me in response to my question: `You 
better watch television on such and such date; I will screw you 
there.'" 
  "All of us," Burg continues, "have no problem with paying 
the 
political price for our concepts. The only difference is that 
we feel we have a duty. After all, if Ramon, Beilin, and I 
should start up a business of political counsels, we would be 
the best in Israel. Each one of us has an alternative. Beilin 
once said that he wants to leave the political life as a person 
whose stands are clear and well-known." 
  [Doweq] You are so talented, and yet you fail the big tests. 
  [Burg] We fail in every narrow-based public test. We will 
be beaten every time when we take on the establishment and fight 
it with our hands tied behind our back. In the primaries, 
however, this group will score very high." 
  [Doweq] All of you? Peretz hardly made it to the Knesset 
and Dayan was moved forward only because she was a woman. 
  [Burg] Okay, not all of us. There is natural selection; 
even Darwin said that. [end Burg] 
  Since the rift with Zvili, there have been no personal 
clashes in the octet. It would seem, Merom says, that each of 
us has found his field of operation and political advantages. 
Ramon and Beilin are our yuppies. We have a red-neck 
moshavnik, a kibbutznik, a woman, a resident of a development 
town, and an Arab. 
  "They are trying to say we are an elitist group, but the 
fact 
is that our group best represents the Israeli society. Often we 
joke about the fact that we have three oriental Jews among us -- 
'Amir Peretz, Shmu'el Avital, and... Nawaf Musaliha." Merom 
also speaks of personal friendship among the group members. 
They all visited each others' homes. 
  In their meetings they speak freely. They also distribute 
the roles: Ramon will be prime minister; Peretz is to head the 
Histadrut labor federation; Burg is the only one willing to run 
for head of the Jewish Agency; Musaliha, deputy health minister, 
will be the first Arab minister; Hagay Merom is seen as the next 
Labor chairman; Beilin is and will remain in foreign affairs. 
Avital and Dayan's roles are not clear as yet; they are 
newcomers with the group, and have no clearly defined areas of 
operation. 
  In 1991, before the Labor convention, they spoke of quitting 
the party and joining up with the Citizens' Rights Movement. 
They spent nights talking about this. One night they even flew 
to Cairo for political talks that Beilin initiated, and 
continued to debate the issue there. They almost decided to 
quit. Merom says that Zvili then brought them classified 
information -- which cannot be revealed yet -- which proved to 
support their stands. Eventually, they decided to stay in the 
party. 
  Zvili reminded Ramon of that night on the first day of the 
party conference. I have a feeling, he told Ramon, that you 
decided to return home only to destroy it from the inside. 
  Before the previous conference, they drafted a 10-point 
document and presented it as one to the Party Secretariat. Burg 
hoisted the banner of separating religion from politics; Merom 
advocated primaries; Musaliha had a resolution passed, though 
not implemented, to set up an Arab district in the party; Ramon 
and Peretz then started throwing rocks at the Histadrut building. 
  In a fierce speech, Ramon presented his opinion of the 
Histadrut. He was representing a negligible minority in the 
party, but scored enormous public sympathy. Seeing the size of 
support Ramon is gaining, Zvili stood up against him, his group, 
and his paper on the very occasion. He shook the group. The 
rift, which according to Zvili started much sooner, has turned 
into a fact. Today, Zvili says that he had warned them not to 
make such remarks. 
  The next day, Zvili seemed better positioned. The group 
suffered a blow and nearly broke into pieces, while he was 
appointed head of Peres' election team. During the struggle 
between Rabin and Peres, Ramon went swimming. Later on, he 
jumped on Rabin's wagon, befriended him, became closer, did a 
god job in the public relations campaign, and was appointed 
minister. Zvili also wanted to be minister, but Ramon spoiled 
it for him. 
  Zvili fought back. His big opportunity came when he decided 
to run for Labor secretary general against Rabin's candidate, 
Yuval Frenkel. Peres backed Zvili. The octet split. Burg, 
Merom, and Beilin supported and promoted him. To Ramon's 
dismay, Zvili won. 
  Ramon lost again when he wanted to appoint Hagay Merom as 
chairman of the Labor faction and coalition, and again when the 
group ran 'Amir Peretz for Histadrut secretary general. The 
group takes pride for scoring 35 percent of the vote, but Zvili 
says that even if they were represented by a scarecrow, they 
would have scored the same support because of the built-in 
hatred of some of the voters for the Histadrut. 
  The octet now considers adding members. There are several 
candidates: Avi Yehezqel, Efrayim Sne, Dalya Itzik, Rafi Elul. 
At the same time, Ramon launched a move that would bring in 
Shim'on Sheves, the Prime Minister's Office director general. 
There is a serious problem with Hagay Merom, who hates Sheves. 
He still remembers how, speaking from the Knesset podium, Merom 
called on Rabin to shut Sheves' mouth. 
  Ramon's move is calculated and careful. Sheves gains power 
in the party thanks to his proximity to the prime minister. He 
is also well situated in the United Kibbutz Movement, Merom's 
constituency. Ramon: "Sheves has a large group in the party. 
We share views on many issues and we can cooperate. Personal 
problems exist on both sides, but I believe they can be handled." 
  Merom: "Ramon knows I am the key figure in this move, which 
is why he is careful." 
  Ramon considers Merom a cunning man. He is said to have a 
short fuse and blows up quickly. 
  The number of Labor party circles will soon beat the number 
of Knesset members: the Next Generation, the Mashov Circle; 
Hakfar Hayaroq Circle, the Hofit Circle, the Ef'al Circle, the 
New Direction Circle, 'Amir Peretz' new circle, and the camp 
Finance Minister Shohat plans to establish. 
  The octet is made of the Mashov and Kfar Hayaroq Circles. 
They are mostly talented, intelligent, well spoken, and media 
favorites. Burg: "We represent a novelty in Israeli politics. 
This is scary. Our friendship is threatening. There are not 
many bodies from whose meetings nothing leaks." 
  Once every week or two they meet in a place set by Ramon. 
Ronit, his bureau chief, notifies them of the time and place. 
Usually, the meeting takes place on Monday night. Ramon always 
arrives at the end. Often he breaks up the forum in the very 
last moment because of some television appearance. No meeting 
is held without him. He always opens the meeting with a review 
of the recent cabinet session. Yosi Beilin will later brief 
them about "the way things stand," and present his evaluations. 
Then they will exchange views. 
  For years, Burg took notes in a notebook which Merom handled 
when Burg spoke. Now he uses the computer. According to him, 
he reserves the material for a book he will write one day. In 
the meantime, the minutes are being kept in Jerusalem bank safe. 
Only Burg has the key. Burg is the joker of the band. 
  In their last session they discussed the results of Ramon's 
resignation, and marked their next struggle: Open primaries in 
the Labor Party. They know that in open primaries they stand a 
better chance than inside the establishment. 
  Zvili: "They are a nice group. Most of them are talented; 
not all. The fact that they are together makes them a source of 
power. Yet, they have never faced a real test. I am sorry they 
opted for total destruction. That is why I could not stay with 
them. Their hatred for the Histadrut has changed into an 
obsession."

  [Text] An Israeli civilian was stabbed at an Ashdod gas 
station this morning, apparently by an Arab with nationalist 
motives. The condition of the wounded man, a new immigrant from 
Russia, is not grave. He was transferred to Kaplan Hospital. 
Our correspondents Yehudit Yehezqeli and Nisim Qeynan report 
that the assailant escaped on foot. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 15 February 
carries an interview with a police officer who says the police 
have captured an "18-year-old Arab suspect from Gaza, who led 
police to where he threw the ax he used in the attack."] 
  A Border Police force captured two members of an Islamic 
Jihad band in Gaza. Two Uzi submachine guns, which were stolen 
with eight other submachine guns from Moshav Hodiyya in the 
south about 10 days ago, were found in their possession. 
  Faris Abu-Zakar, a member of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine's Red Eagles in Rafah, wounded Friday in 
a clash with soldiers, has died of his wounds.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, official press spokesman </F>
of the Islamic Group Abroad, by Hisham Mubarak, in Denmark; date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Mubarak] What were the pressures that made you 
leave Peshawar and seek asylum in Denmark? 
  [Qasim] The pressure began after an article appeared in the 
magazine AL-MURABITUN in which I criticized Saudi Arabia for 
refusing entry to pilgrims from countries that supported Iraq 
during the occupation of Kuwait. I also wrote several articles 
criticizing the Al Sa'ud rule. Saudi Arabia issued an order to 
the relief organizations operating in Afghanistan to stop 
supporting al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [the Islamic Group, IG]. The 
Saudi Government officially asked Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif to extradite me to Egypt and the Egyptian Government. 
This information reached 'Abdol Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the 
Afghan Ettehad-e Eslami, who asked me to enter Afghanistan. He 
put a car and Muslim guards at my disposal. He also put my new 
house under guard. I found it difficult to move around. I then 
received an invitation from Denmark and I travelled there. I 
asked for political asylum and was granted it. 
  Before that, martyr 'Adli Yusuf, whose nom de guerre was 
"Abu- Suhayb" was the first to arrive in Afghanistan through 
Saudi Arabia in 1985. He was followed by martyr 'Abd-al-Fattah 
(Abu-al-Yusr) also through Saudi Arabia and then by 'Ali 
'Abd-al-Fattah and Muhammad Shawqi al-Islambuli. 
  As for Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri's group, some went to Saudi 
Arabia while he arrived in Afghanistan. At first, they were 
called "al-Muttahamun" [the accused] in the al-Jihad 
Organization case. They became acquainted with Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, a rich Saudi national who believes in the idea of 
al-Jihad. He trusted them and together they established the 
"al-Qa'idah" [the base], a guesthouse for receiving those 
wishing to join the Afghan jihad. They called themselves the 
(Jama'at al-Jihad) from that time. 
  [Mubarak] There are reports about uninterrupted contacts 
between the IG and the U.S. Administration and its Embassy in 
Cairo. Can you explain to us what went on in these contacts? 
  [Qasim] This is no different from the issue of dialogue with 
the government. We did not contact the U.S. Embassy. All these 
reports of such contacts are lies. I can confirm that no 
contacts have been held on any level with the U.S. Embassy. It 
was the Americans who asked for contact but we refused it. 
  [Mubarak] It is not important who began the contacts, but 
what happened in them? 
  [Qasim] There were no contacts. There were attempts on their 
part, which we rejected. 
  [Mubarak] How were these attempts made? 
  [Qasim] The first attempt with me was made following my 
release in 1988 and my escape for the first time from the 
sentries around my house. A lawyer came and asked for an 
appointment because some foreigners wanted to meet 
me--correspondents and officials from human rights organizations 
in their countries. The first was a U.S. correspondent, the 
second was the chief editor of a Yugoslav magazine, and the 
third was the first secretary in the Swiss Embassy. I began by 
asking them: Why are you interested in meeting me? The Swiss 
emphasized that the aim was to learn the violations to which the 
IG and its members were subjected in prisons so as to inform his 
government, which would then pressure the Egyptian Government. 
The American and the Yugoslav said the meeting was important to 
them as correspondents and because they recognized me as a 
source of information on what was happening in Egypt. I 
explained to them in detail the violations, torture, and 
detention to which the IG members were subjected. The dialogue 
went no further. 
  [Mubarak] Were other attempts made? 
  [Qasim] The same lawyer came and asked for an appointment 
for 
the U.S. correspondent. I refused and asked him to tell the 
American to send a photocopy of what he published about our 
first meeting in which I spoke about human rights violations so 
that I might see the result of the meetings. Otherwise, why 
should we meet again? 
  [Mubarak] But these attempts were made by correspondents. 
What about the U.S. Embassy? 
  [Qasim] The only time the embassy tried was following my 
arrest and while I was in prison at the end of 1988. The 
attempt was made through the same lawyer. He told me that the 
embassy's political officer wanted to meet me. I was surprised 
because how could he meet me when he knew I was in prison. The 
lawyer stressed that the official said he himself would solve 
it. I told the lawyer to ask him first: What do you want from 
this meeting? When the lawyer returned, he said the official 
wanted the following: 
  1. To get acquainted with me personally. 
  2. To be assured that we did not regard the United States 
as "the great satan." 
  3. To stress to the IG, represented in my person, that 
the Egyptian Government does not use the U.S. aid reaching Egypt 
to strike at the Islamic movement. 
  My answer was to refuse a meeting. We do not meet officials 
from governments. And for us, the United States is the major 
enemy, just like Israel. 
  [Mubarak] Why has the IG carried out acts of violence 
against tourism? 
  [Qasim] There are several reasons for the attacks on 
tourism: 
  First, tourism represents a massive source of illicit 
[haram] 
state revenue. This revenue provides the ruling regime with 
financial resources that help it to stay in power. We believe 
the regime should be removed. So, we decided to strike at this 
activity to deprive the regime of this revenue and hasten its 
demise. According to statistics, the annual income generated by 
tourism is 3.2 billion pounds [about $1 billion]. The 
government's own reports admit that a limited number of 
operations by the Islamic groups, which cost us nothing, have 
undermined this illicit revenue. 
  Second, tourism in its current form is pure evil. It is an 
activity through which prostitution and AIDS are being spread, 
particularly by female Jewish tourists. It is a despicable 
source of a host of abominations. Tourism is also a way for 
foreign intelligence services to collect information about the 
Islamic movement. So, tourism is a certified evil and must be 
terminated. 
  [Mubarak] But these acts of violence that you committed 
involved murder. Tourists were killed. What does the 
government have to do with this? 
  [Qasim] Some tourists should not be killed. The target of 
our campaign is tourism, not tourists. We have taken several 
measures to protect the lives of tourists. We have issued 
several statements warning tourists against coming to Egypt, 
where their lives will be endangered. We have said that whoever 
visits Egypt subjects himself to danger because of our campaign 
against the tourism sector. We have also sent messages to the 
competent authorities warning them against inviting tourists for 
these reasons. Having done all this, those tourists who still 
visit the country are doing so at their own risk. 
  [Mubarak] You said tourism is pure evil and a source of 
abomination. This is one of the reasons you cite for the 
attacks against the tourism sector. But AIDS and drugs are not 
a result of tourism. There are countries that have no tourism 
but in which drugs and AIDS are widespread. 
  [Qasim] The Egyptians did not use drugs before the start of 
the tourism boom. I agree that tourism may not be the sole 
cause for the spread of drugs but it is a major factor. Press 
reports have repeatedly linked tourism with drugs, AIDS, and 
espionage. 
  [Mubarak] Suppose, for the sake of argument, that tourism 
was the reason for the spread of AIDS and drugs as you say and 
that it is an abomination that should be changed. Why did you 
decide to strike at tourism only last year when we know that the 
tourist areas are centered in Upper Egypt, where, historically, 
your influence has always been. There must be other reasons 
prompting you to strike at tourism. Otherwise, why did you keep 
silent about this evil? You have existed since the 
mid-seventies. 
  [Qasim] Tourism is basically permissible if it is conducted 
according to Islamic rules. But if a war is raging, then why 
should the tourists come to these areas when they know they are 
in danger, unless there are other reasons making them come. 
  [Mubarak] For some time, we have seen reports of divisions 
and splits within the IG, especially after the tourism 
incidents, when some dissident leaders rejected this tactic. 
This analysis is confirmed by the calm in several governorates, 
such as al-Minya and Suhaj, where the IG has a strong influence 
and yet refused to participate in this conflict against the 
security organs. What is your view? 
  [Qasim] There are no differences or splits on any leadership 
or base level inside the IG. There are no differences over 
tourism or any other issue concerning some governorates' 
nonparticipation in striking at tourism. There are two reasons 
for this: 
  1. Reasons that concern the government. The regime 
cannot open several fronts simultaneously. It has not succeeded 
in the battle it started in Dayrut and will be unable to decide 
this battle even with the forces it has brought in from Cairo 
and the areas surrounding Dayrut. So, the regime prefers not to 
start new battles now. 
  2. Reasons that concern the IG. We have not decided upon 
a comprehensive confrontation. What is happening now is 
preparation, only "a hotting up." It is in our interest at the 
preparatory stage to maintain bases in calm governorates so that 
they can operate calmly in accordance with the plan prepared for 
them and achieve what is required of them. Briefly, we are the 
ones who will decide when and who will move. These governorates 
are required to remain calm. Their role has not come yet. 
  [Mubarak] You issued a statement saying that investments 
will 
soon be the target of IG operations. When will you carry out 
violent acts against investments? 
  [Qasim] The timing for striking at investments depends on 
several circumstances. These include the nature of the Egyptian 
security organs' performance against us and then our assessment 
of the conflict with the state. If the state opts for a new 
escalation against the IG, then the investment sector will be 
the target of revenge as a kind of deterrent. 
  [Mubarak] In which case, you will not have the religious 
grounds you cited for the attacks on tourism. What are your 
reasons for the campaign against investment? 
  [Qasim] We seek to destroy all the state organs and 
facilities with the least possible bloodshed. The task is easy. 
A single IG military unit can strike at investment in Egypt 
when the time is right. 
  [Mubarak] The military operations you directed against 
tourism have cost you a lot. The security organs have 
eradicated the IG influence in many areas. Most of the major IG 
leaders are in jail. Did the IG make an error of judgment when 
it took its struggle against the state to the highest level with 
the attacks on such an important sector as tourism? 
  [Qasim] I big to differ with your use of the term the 
highest 
possible level. What has happened in our struggle with the 
state is very limited and only in line with the stages we adopt 
in our effort to weaken the state. This is just a prelude to an 
all-out confrontation. The current level of confrontation is 
only the beginning. The major struggle has not begun. Besides, 
the security organs have no clue as to the IG structure. For 
example, the recurring announcement by security officials that 
they have eliminated 99 percent of IG members contradicts the 
daily press reports about the arrests of dozens, even hundreds, 
of people. 
  [Mubarak] I feel that with your campaign against tourism you 
have launched a losing, even suicidal, battle. The ensuing 
security efforts have undercut your operations. 
  [Qasim] The IG is still alive and will remain unshaken. All 
the security strikes have been ineffectual. At any rate, our 
religious duty is to engage in jihad, not to reach a particular 
outcome. We take the right path and God almighty decides on the 
outcome. We do what the shari'ah tells us to do with regard to 
establishing the Islamic state. If the outcome is victory, that 
is fine with us. If it is death, that too is fine. 
  [Mubarak] There have been reports about a dialogue between 
yourself and the security officials following your release in 
1988. What was that about? 
  [Qasim] First, there was no dialogue involved, despite 
recent 
reports concerning a mediation committee. When I was under 
house arrest after my release in 1988, Major General Sa'id 
Thabit of the Internal State Security Service summoned me and 
told me the acts of violence waged by the IG in south Egypt, 
'Ayn Shams [a Cairo suburb], and other areas must end. I stated 
the IG's conditions for ending violence. They are: 
  1. IG detainees and prisoners should be released. 
  2. Propagation activities should be legalized. IG 
mosques must not be sequestered. 
  3. Torture and the holding of hostages should be ended. 
  The security official did not agree. On the contrary. They 
strengthened the guard during my house arrest in 1988. After 
fleeing my house and my arrest in 1989, the same official came 
back and asked me to stop the violence, particularly in 'Ayn 
Shams, which has witnessed a noticeable escalation in the IG 
operations against the police. I repeated what I said about the 
conditions I mentioned. Again, these were rejected. That is 
the story. There was no dialogue. There will not be one. 
  [Mubarak] But there are confirmed reports that a mediation 
committee of religious scholars was coordinating and organizing 
the dialogue between the IG leaders in prison and security 
officials and that that was the reason the government dismissed 
Interior Minister 'Abd-al-Halim Musa, a party to the dialogue. 
  [Qasim] There was no dialogue. Apart from what I said 
earlier, no IG leaders inside the prison or outside have met 
religious scholars or security officials. The mediation story 
was fabricated. We issued a statement dismissing the idea of 
dialogue or mediation. Our position is clear in this regard. 
There can be no truce or reconciliation with the regime. The 
issue is confrontation between the two parties until one 
finishes the other off or the Islamic system is fully applied. 
  [Mubarak] Does this mean the IG insists on rejecting any 
dialogue designed to stop the bloodshed and violence? 
  [Qasim] We will enter no dialogue unless one of two cases 
applies: 
  1. It is dialogue with the state security and government 
shaykhs and ulema with a view to dismissing the suspicions they 
raise occasionally about our ideology. This is our duty and we 
call for it. 
  2. In the event of our achieving power, we might negotiate 
with the key figures of the outgoing authority about the 
conditions for their exit from the country. 
  [Mubarak] But the information indicates that 'Abbud al-Zumur 
was a party to the dialogue. 
  [Qasim] This never happened. What was reported was untrue 
and denied by 'Abbud al-Zumur. 
  [Mubarak] What about press reports attributed to Safwat 
'Abd- 
al-Ghani regarding the mediation committee in which he confirms 
the existence of a dialogue? 
  [Qasim] First, Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani's statements were 
distorted. Second, I am the one who officially expresses the 
IG's positions. I only discussed the mediation issue to deny 
its existence. 
  [Mubarak] Many observers believe the IG has lost on every 
level and that the security services have eliminated its threat. 
What do you think? 
  [Qasim] This is wrong. At the military level, although the 
all-out confrontation has not started, and the struggle is still 
at its preparatory stage, the state has failed to decide a 
single battle. The Dayrut battle has not been decided, despite 
the massive forces brought in from the other governorates. 
Indeed, the IG members in Dayrut exhausted the government 
strength and confused its forces. Military superiority favors 
the IG. We maintain a presence in 18 governorates and their 
scores of towns and hundreds of villages. The state has failed 
to decide even a small battle in one of the 13 towns of Asyut 
Governorate. And Asyut is only one of 18 governorates in which 
we are present. 
  On the political level, the state is suffering various 
political crises. The political forces' rejection of Mubarak's 
nomination is perhaps the best example. On the economic level, 
simple strikes that cost us nothing enable us to obstruct the 
tourism sector; the state is suffering an economic crisis that 
has been deepened by tourism problems. 
  The various levels of struggle have added to the IG's 
firmness. 
  I conclude from this that the IG's curve is going upward, 
contrary to what some people imagine. 
  [Mubarak] I disagree. First, the IG's mosques, known for 
their active role, have been taken by the government. Second, 
you give government failure to decide the battle in Dayrut as 
evidence that the IG is still strong. But the government ended 
your influence in many other regions, like Imbabah, 'Ayn Shams, 
Qina, Aswan, and Damietta. The IG does not exist there. The 
IG's armed elements were liquidated, as many members were 
killed. Finally, that arrivals from Afghanistan are being used 
means the IG is using its last line of defense. 
  [Qasim] This is not true. Statements by security leaders 
indicate that we have killed more of them than they have killed 
of us since 1981. What you said about government successes in 
regions like Aswan, Imbabah, and Qina is not true either. 
Although in the past we used mosques to propagate the message, 
we did not stop when the government controlled the mosques. The 
IG invented methods to continue its activity, such as using 
direct video transmission, audio cassettes, and various 
publications. And educating members in apartments instead of 
mosques--because of the security situation-- allows us to 
intensify our programs. In short, our activity is continuing 
but the methods and means have changed. The participation of IG 
members in Afghanistan in the current struggle in Egypt was 
intended from the beginning. Those members were scheduled to 
return anyway. Your thinking that they are the last line is 
wrong; they are just the beginning of the struggle. Anyway, I 
won't go into more detail about this point. 
  [Mubarak] What are the IG's poles of action now? 
  [Qasim] There are three poles of action. These are: 
  1. The military coup: 
  Work on this level is afoot. The state knows nothing about 
it and its security organs are preoccupied with minor incidents 
carried out by IG youths in Upper Egypt. 
  2. The mass action: 
  When the Islamic revolution takes place, it must be 
accompanied by a widespread mass action. This is vital to 
prevent foreign intervention or at least to have the action 
impede intervention for 18 days, according to our military 
people. Many of the demonstrations we organized were meant, 
among other things, to train the IG cadres in mass action. We 
have expertise in this field. 
  3. The special operations axis: 
  This action is necessary to assassinate some officials. It 
is the stage of heating things up. This organ has gained 
expertise by implementing operations. It is ready now and has a 
role in implementing the plan. This organ is in action and will 
not stop the assassination acts as long as there are 
circumstances that require them. It is wrong for anyone to 
think that the arrest of its members or the halting of its 
activities for some time means an imbalance. Action is taken in 
accordance with a plan drawn up for this organ's work. 
  The state knows nothing about the military organ that is 
responsible for preparing the military coup. It knows nothing 
about the special operations organ. When some of its members 
are arrested, they only know about their group, which is no use 
to the security forces, since the group is completely separate 
and has no links with the other groups. 
  [Mubarak] I feel you are exaggerating the military action. 
We have not heard about military groups belonging to the IG and 
the intelligence service has arrested no elements affiliated to 
you. What proof do you have? 
  [Qasim] The events of 1981 [the killing of al-Sadat] answer 
you. The security organs had no idea about the IG's military 
wing. This is the most convincing answer. The arrest or 
nonarrest of military elements does not mean there are or are 
not military groups. Generally speaking, there were military 
people in the al- Jihad case. 
  [Mubarak] The military who left service or were accused in 
the al-Jihad case were officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers. They had no influence. Supposing that what you say 
about a presence in this sector is true, this does not mean 
there is any real danger. What do you think? 
  [Qasim] I beg to differ with you. The influential forces are 
the minor officers and the situation in the military units 
confirms this. Soldiers do not get their orders from 
high-ranking officers such as a brigadier general and above. We 
are convinced of the importance of the lower ranks. This is a 
lesson from history. They are the motivators. 
  [Mubarak] What are the details of the coup plan you 
prepared in 1981 and whose spark was the attack on the reviewing 
stand against President al-Sadat? 
  [Qasim] The plan was based on several axes: Military action 
to seize control of the main centers, such as the operations 
room, the Defense Ministry, the Interior Ministry, the 
television and radio building, and the important bridges. The 
plan also called for the issuance of fabricated statements 
attributed to various army units expressing support for the 
Islamic revolution in order to confuse the Army Command and 
paralyze its activity. At the same time, armed elements would 
move to kill some influential state figures or those who would 
attempt to ride the popular wave. The people would then go down 
to the streets to prevent foreign intervention. We also had an 
alternative plan that was to be implemented in an emergency. 
This is the one that was carried out in 1981 after the arrest 
of a number of leaders, including myself, during the September 
campaign. 
  The organization decided to implement the emergency plan for 
fear that the security service may have learned about the 
organization after our arrest. The emergency plan was amended 
after we learned that Khalid al-Islambuli has been selected to 
participate in the military parade. The leadership was hesitant 
whether to go ahead with the plan to assassinate al-Sadat or 
not. The brothers in Cairo decided to carry out the 
assassination plan, and that the shots to be fired by 
al-Islambuli would herald the start of the revolution and the 
movement in Cairo and Asyut. Usamah Hafiz was asked to travel 
to Upper Egypt to inform the other leaders about the plan. But 
he could not get to Asyut because the police had established 
checkpoints along the road. Usamah was forced to change his 
itinerary. Therefore, the assassination operation came as a 
surprise to the Upper Egypt leaders. They thought that the fact 
that they had not received information about the assassination 
plan meant that the plan has been postponed. They waited for 
two days in order to prepare for the movement that began on the 
first day of the holiday. They succeeded in seizing control of 
the Asyut Governorate and the security directorate. But the 
security forces were able after many hours to regain control of 
the governorate, and the plan failed in Cairo. 
  [Mubarak] How did Khalid al-Islambuli join the IG? 
  [Qasim] Khalid is the younger brother of Muhammad Shawqi al- 
Islambuli, one of the founders of the IG. Muhammad invited him 
to join the group, and he did. He began attending the weekly 
meetings we held in al-Rahmah Mosque. We decided to accept him 
as a member, and I was his amir in the Naja' Hammadi group. He 
was full of enthusiasm. He asked me more than once to give him 
permission to direct his unit's guns at the presidential palace 
where al-Sadat lived. He was an officer in the Artillery Corps. 
I used to calm him down, and hinted to him that something was 
being prepared and he should wait. Later I included Khalid in 
the group responsible for carrying out the coup.
