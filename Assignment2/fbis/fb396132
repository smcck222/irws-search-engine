  [Text] The Russian president has written a letter to 
deputies of the State Duma. It says that the free 
interpretation of articles of the Constitution creates a 
precedent which the chambers could use in the future to put 
through federal laws and adopt other decisions in circumvention 
of the Constitution. What is at issue is the procedure for the 
election of the chairman of the lower house of the Russian 
parliament -- the State Duma. The letter states that the 
election of Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the house, formally 
violated the Russian Constitution. The point is that Ivan 
Rybkin required 225 deputies' votes for election, half the 
number of seats in parliament, rather than 223, half of those 
elected. This is what our parliamentary correspondent has just 
reported. This was also reported by AFP. We asked Ivan Rybkin 
for clarification on this score. 
  [Begin Rybkin recording] I would like to say that in the 
French parliament it is sufficient for the absolute majority of 
its members to be present in the chambers for there to be a 
quorum. This is calculated from the number of seats actually 
occupied in the house. A motion put to the vote is regarded as 
adopted if it gains an absolute majority of votes cast. A 
majority of the majority. 
  We have chosen a stricter option, according to the usual 
method that was worked out in the standing orders of the 
Congress of People's Deputies and other legislative bodies of 
Russian power. Namely, we always calculate the quorum from the 
number of actually elected deputies. I believe that this norm 
is a sensible and thoroughly considered one and if there are any 
variant interpretations in future, we can remove them. [end 
recording] 
  We also asked what would happen if this matter were to be 
taken to the Constitutional Court and the court decided that 
Chairman Rybkin should stand down and deputies elect a new 
chairman. This is what Ivan Rybkin replied. 
  [Begin Rybkin recording] The chairman of the State Duma 
should be an example of obedience of the law and that will, 
undoubtedly, be the case. But I also believe that what has been 
worked out and achieved through long years of Russian practice 
should be respected by all branches of power. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report in the "Duma" column: "Ivan Rybkin </F>
Has Coordinated Questions on the State Budget With the Premier. 
Sergey Dubinin and Viktor Gerashchenko Have Been Tasked To 
Respond to Them"] 
  [Text] On 4 February the State Duma intends to hear from 
acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and Central Bank Chairman 
Viktor Gerashchenko. Dubinin and Gerashchenko will apparently 
have to report on budget guidelines for the first quarter. Duma 
Speaker Ivan Rybkin yesterday met with the premier and 
apparently discussed with him plans for the lower house's work 
on the budget and economic course. 
  Similar "working" negotiations with Boris Yeltsin, according 
to Ivan Rybkin, concerned the address the president intends to 
make in the Federal Assembly at a joint session of its houses on 
18 February. Rybkin refused to disclose its specific 
propositions. 
  Rybkin "relates calmly" to the president's address to 
parliament, in which the latter is accused of violating 
constitutional norms, in particular in electing the Duma 
speaker. "We have developed normal working relations with Boris 
Nikolayevich," Rybkin stated. 
  Indeed, during his first few weeks in the high post the 
speaker has distanced himself a little from the communist 
majority in the Duma to which he owes his election. Intensive 
talks with the president and the premier will apparently have a 
greater impact on Rybkin's position than his party affiliation. 
The meetings with the premier are especially important: Rybkin 
can become the most active supporter of the new government's 
economic initiatives in the Duma. 
  The speaker displayed "party indiscipline," which is 
becoming 
increasingly characteristic of him, when he supported the 
candidacy of Vladimir Podoprigora for the post of Duma apparatus 
chief. The leaders of the Russian Federation Communist Party, 
the Democratic Party of Russia, and other factions of communist 
orientation rejected that proposal, saying the Vladimir 
Podoprigora, being chairman of the Federation Council's Foreign 
Relations Committee, cannot be chief of apparatus in another 
house. In spite of the obvious juridical nonsense, however, the 
Duma speaker continued to insist on the Russia's Choice 
candidacy. 
  No preliminary agenda for the State Duma plenary session, 
which is due on 4 February, has been defined yet. Faction 
leaders practically unanimously sent the declaration on the 
succession of the Federal Assembly to be reworked. As Duma 
Speaker Ivan Rybkin stated yesterday, "before the draft reaches 
the stage of discussion at the session, it will undergo 
substantial changes." According to Rybkin, the document will be 
executed as a declaration without any political, let alone 
scandalous, implications. 
  Members of the Duma Council failed to reach agreement on the 
issue of amnesty timed to coincide with the adoption of the new 
constitution. Fearing that any decision on the number and 
nature of crimes falling under the amnesty will cause censure in 
various parts of society, the faction leaders decided to 
postpone the discussion of the edict indefinitely. The same sad 
fate befell the Criminal Code, which was originally to be 
discussed as a package with the amnesty law.

  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin had a meeting with State Duma Speaker Ivan 
Rybkin on Wednesday to discuss the place of a new residence for 
the lower chamber of the Russian parliament. 
  The Duma is now situated in the former Comecon building and 
lawmakers complain that it is incovenient for work. 
  The government offered parliamentarians five new places, 
including the building of the Russian Management Academy in the 
south west of the capital and two buildings in downtown Moscow. 
  No reports whether the prime minister and the Duma speaker 
had reached any agreement were available. 
  However, several lawmakers said that the Duma continues to 
insist that the former parliament building which was pounded by 
tanks during the October revolt and then transferred to the 
government, be returned to the legislature.

<F P=106> [Petr Zhuravlev, Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Duma" </F>
rubric: "Authorities Tired of Truce. Deputies Dream of Rights 
and Supreme Soviet Property"] 
  [Text] A draft declaration on the new Russian parliament's 
right of succession as the country's top legislative body is 
supposed to be submitted to the upcoming plenary session of the 
State Duma on 4 February. The draft is being submitted on 
behalf of the Duma committee on legislation while its direct 
author, to all appearances, is committee head Vladimir Isakov. 
  It is supposed, first and foremost, that the declaration 
will 
be a joint document of the State Duma and the Federation Council 
which, "recognizing the historical responsibility for the fate 
of parliamentarianism and expressing anxiety at the state of the 
legal system" of the country, state their claim to the entire 
legacy of the Congress and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian 
Federation. True, the greater part of the powers of soviets is 
recognized as forfeited, and the right of succession is being 
declared only to that part which "does not contravene the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation." 
  All the laws passed by the Supreme Soviet that do not 
contravene the Constitution are recognized as "having the same 
juridical power" as the laws passed by the Duma. As for edicts, 
Mr. Isakov here goes back to his pet idea of ousting the 
president and the government from the realm of lawmaking. 
Edicts and "other normative acts" contravening laws passed by 
the Supreme Soviet and the Federal Assembly are proposed to be 
recognized invalid. 
  Claims to "rights of succession" in the legislative sphere, 
however, is not the whole story. The present deputies also long 
for the Supreme Soviet's and the Congress' property. 
Considering the current problem of accommodation for the 
parliament, one can suppose that what they have in mind first 
and foremost is the building at 2 Krasnopresnenskaya 
Naberezhnaya, and only then do they have in mind the car pool, 
the vacation home, and so forth. In addition to the White 
House, parliamentarians are showing a certain interest in the 
mass media founders rights remaining from the Supreme Soviet, 
and in that body's right to representation in international 
organizations. 
  To be quite fair, it is necessary to say that following a 
long process of approvals and introduction of amendments, the 
text would probably lose much of its bite. But it is simply 
impossible to describe the draft declaration as the first attack 
"along the president-parliament front of the new convocation." 
  One can only add that the above draft does not quite 
correspond to the Constitution, which specifies that parliament 
passes "laws and decrees," and there is no mention of any 
declarations. Besides, Mr. Isakov's intention to reduce 
presidential edicts to the level of economic management 
directives does not agree with the text passed on 12 December. 
At any rate, the Duma bloc of Communists and Agrarians, to 
which Vladimir Isakov belongs, is known for its program 
aspiration to dispute the referendum results.

  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Leaders of all factions of 
the State Duma, including Yegor Gaydar, expressed concern over 
the military aspect of the Russian-Georgian treaty which is to 
be signed by President Boris Yeltsin in Tbilisi on Thursday and 
warned him they may not ratify it. 
  "The provisions of the treaty envisaging, in particular, a 
further agreement on assisting Georgia in creating its armed 
forces, in arming them and providing for them weapons, military 
equipment and technologies can, as we believe, detsabilise the 
situation in the Caucasus and become a barrier for the 
ratification of the treaty by the State Duma", they said in a 
letter to the president signed by Speaker Ivan Rybkin. 
  Yeltsin, in his turn, said before departing for Tbilisi on 
Thursday that the treaty will not be submitted for parliament 
ratification until Georgia settles the conflicts in its two 
self-styled regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

  [Text] Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev says his 
department on the whole approves of the U.S.-proposed 
Partnership for Peace plan but is opposed to the document being 
used against any third country. 
  If peace is to be maintained, all countries must equally be 
involved, he told Interfax on Wednesday [2 February]. 
  "Although it is a good document politically, said Grachev, 
the Defence Ministry's response to NATO's new plan is rather 
cautious." 
  Grachev is concerned at the fact that all former Warsaw Pact 
nations and the Baltic states were seeing the plan as an 
intermediary stage towards full NATO membership. 
  "If the Partnership for Peace plan will gradually drag those 
states into the North Atlantic Alliance without consent or 
consultations with Russia, we will not support it," he said. 
  In the minister's view, NATO's enlargement poses a certain 
threat to Russian security. 
  Grachev says the PP [Partnership for Peace] plan provides 
for 
coordinated effort by NATO and other countries, Russia included, 
over "an interim period following the break up of the Warsaw 
Pact." Until European political structures emerge, all states 
must cooperate to defuse tensions in the continent, particularly 
in the former Yugoslavia, he said.

Lieutenant-General Henning von Ondarza, commander in chief of 
NATO Allied Forces Central Europe, to the central European 
sector. 
  The general has already had a meeting with the chief of the 
Russian Federation General Staff, the commander in chief of the 
land forces, and the command of the Moscow military district and 
paid a visit to the Kantemir Tank Division. 
  Henning von Ondarza was more interested in the soldiers' 
welfare and their attitude to the service as well as in the 
principles underpinning manpower acquisition for subunits than 
in their combat proficiency or modern equipment. 
  The general emphasized that armed forces organizational 
development in Russia and Germany, which are land-based powers, 
is different from that in the United States and the main thing 
is that universal military service obligation should be retained 
in Russia and Germany alike, so that armies do not become closed 
societies and so that high mobilization reserves are preserved. 
  [Begin Von Ondarza, recording in German fading to Russian 
translation] The fact that each person is doing something useful 
for their country is the decisive factor in favor of military 
service obligation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 22 for 2 </F>
February 1994; by Andrey Pershin, Andrey Petrovskiy, and 
Vladimir Shishlin, edited by Boris Grishchenko] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is due to arrive for 
one day of summit talks in Tbilisi on Thursday. He and Georgian 
leader Eduard Shevardnadze will first meet privately and are to 
join their delegations later, Yeltsin's press office told 
Interfax. 
  The two countries are expected to sign about 20 agreements 
including an outline friendship and cooperation treaty. Others 
deal with trade and economic cooperation for 1994, free trade 
and the status of Russian border guards deployed in Georgia. 
  Yeltsin and Shevardnadze are scheduled to hold a joint news 
conference afterwards. 
  The Russian leader is due to fly back to Moscow at 21:00 
local time. 
  The framework agreement binds Russia and Georgia to build 
their relations as two friendly nations and to stay out of any 
blocs or alliances spearheaded *against each other. It also 
provides for a mechanism of consultations and subsequent 
measures to remove any threat to each other's interests or 
security. 
  Experts say parts of the treaty dealing with legal and 
property matters are designed to help ease the process as much 
as possible. 
  The two sides are committed to working out a package of 
measures to regulate migration and travelling. Russia and 
Georgia are also determined to promote economic cooperation by 
helping towards the formation of markets in the Black Sea region 
and Europe and a common economic area. 
  The treaty enshrines the two sides' desire for cooperation 
in 
certain areas of the economy, science and technology. It also 
provides for mutual responsibility for a free flow of oil and 
gas and unimpeded passenger and freight traffic through each 
other's territory. 
  The two countries are expected to promote closer cooperation 
in space research, personnel training and so on. 
  The 10-year agreement is to be extended automatically unless 
one of the sides wishes to break it off upon its expiration.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 2 February, in a report from the daily 
"Details" program presented by Nikolay Svanidze, today outlined 
the reasons why most of the State Duma is against Yeltsin's 
visit to Georgia and claimed to have information that seven, not 
three, Russian military bases could soon be set up on Georgian 
territory. 
  "In fact, Yeltsin is returning to the position of Catherine 
II, who regarded Georgia as the gateway to the Caucasus," 
Svanidze said, "and he has timed things perfectly -- Georgia is 
ready to make concessions. Georgia simply has no choice but to 
make concessions to Russia: Having suffered what amounts to 
military defeat, threatened with economic disintegration and 
hunger, with gangs on the rampage, and most of its' territory 
out of control; Georgia could simply cease to exist. 
Shevardnadze understands this and is ready to say `yes' to many 
demands from Yeltsin." 
  The package of agreements on military cooperation to be 
signed tomorrow has already "incurred wrath" in the northern 
Caucasus, part of Russia, Svanidze said as the video cut to 
President of Chechnya Dzhokhar Dudayev. Yeltsin, the 
government, Russia's Foreign Ministry, and military leaders are 
for union with Georgia. Most of the State Duma is against it, 
he said. He then interviewed Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of 
the State Duma committee for CIS affairs, who said a treaty 
signed by Russia would mean that "Russia, having taken measures 
to arm the Georgian Army, must at the same time prevent 
Abkhazia's Armed Forces from arming itself, which creates a 
one-sided situation that would engender a desire for revenge." 
  Armenia and Azerbaijan are waiting eagerly for the results 
of 
the Yeltsin visit to Georgia to see if Russia may also become "a 
local UN" for them, Svanidze warned. 
  Opponents of the treaty on friendship and cooperation with 
Georgia in the State Duma fear most "the very serious" level of 
military assistance it implies, Svanidze said, pointing to 
article three, in which Russia undertakes to help in the setting 
up, strengthening, and equipping of the Georgian Army. 
  "The text of the treaty says nothing about military bases," 
Svanidze continued, "but we have information that a memorandum 
will be signed during Yeltsin's meeting with Shevardnadze that 
will start a negotiation process for the setting up of seven 
Russian military bases on Georgian territory, I repeat seven; 
initially, the issue was of three bases being set up. It is 
precisely for this reason that the military, who were previously 
against union with Georgia, now insist on it." Two of the bases 
will be in Abkhazia -- one in Sukhumi, the other in Gudauta, 
Svanidze added. 
  Zatulin concluded: "I would like to say, on the eve of the 
visit by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, that peace in the northern 
Caucasus could be damaged." 
  The council of State Duma factions today approved a letter 
to 
Yeltsin asking him not to go to Tbilisi, or at least not to sign 
the treaty, Svanidze said.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 February--Boris Yeltsin has stated that he 
will sign the friendship, good-neighborliness and cooperation 
Treaty in Tbilisi today but its ratification in the parliament 
will be delayed until the conflicts in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia are fully resolved. The President stated this at the 
Vnukovo-2 airport before his departure for an official visit to 
Georgia. The President admitted that situation in South Ossetia 
and Abkhazia "create problems which should be solved on the 
step-by-step basis." 
  Answering the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question on the main 
aims of his visit, the President said: "First of all, we are 
trying to stop bloodshed in Georgia. Russia cannot wait 
indifferently for things to sort themselves out over there." 
The second aim of the visit, said Yeltsin, is joint defense of 
the borders and the third is joint use and protection of the 
railways. The President also noted the need for a full-scale 
treaty with Georgia as well as a number of military-technical 
agreements.

  [Text] Early this morning the presidential airplane took 
off for Tbilisi. The program for Yeltsin's one-day trip to the 
Georgian capital is very busy. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] We will sign the treaty today, 
after all, but we will wait with ratification until the conflict 
is completely settled, and this will suit both our Caucasian 
republics and, I think, Georgia and Russia as a whole. 
  Together with the CSCE and EEC, Russia is mediating in order 
to somehow halt the bloodshed there; second, to protect the 
border jointly; third, jointly to exploit railways and protect 
them against attacks, accordingly; fourth, a full-scale treaty 
to be signed with Georgia as well as military-technical 
agreements, an accord. [end recording]

<F P=106> [TRUD military observer Viktor Badurkin commentary under the </F>
"View on Situation" rubric: "Should We Have no Faith in Signed 
Document?"] 
  [Text] The signatures of Presidents Boris Yeltsin, Leonid 
Kravchuk, and Bill Clinton had hardly dried out on their joint 
statement on the future fate of Ukrainian nuclear missiles when 
it began to be "torpedoed" in Kiev in parliament and especially 
at the Ministry of Defense. Whereas the parliamentarians 
restricted themselves to verbal criticism of their president's 
conciliatory behavior and their dissatisfaction with the amount 
of compensation for nuclear disarmament, the generals 
immediately embarked on decisive action. 
  At first the idea developed at the heart of the military 
department of retaining on a temporary basis at "S" facilities 
(special bases) the nuclear warheads which had been separated 
from their delivery vehicles. And then a week ago an 
unexpectedly but very insistent proposal was made at the 
ministry collegium that the command of missile troops stationed 
on Ukrainian territory should take an oath of allegiance to 
Ukraine. 
  On the subject of the political "overtones" of the moves by 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, it is hard to see them as 
anything but a clear challenge to the line which Leonid Kravchuk 
is pursuing with regard to the state's nuclear disarmament. 
After all it is clearly written into the Moscow agreement that 
all nuclear warheads should be withdrawn from Ukrainian 
territory to Russia for the purpose of their subsequent 
dismantling in the shortest possible time. You might ask, why 
then compel the missile troops' officers to take an oath of 
allegiance to Ukraine, why form their own missile troops, and 
why create a command center for strategic nuclear forces? 
  You can only come to one conclusion: The Kiev generals are, 
irrespective of the consequences, attempting to draw out the 
process of handing over the nuclear weapons to Russia. What is 
more, this is being done to the accompaniment of public 
assurances from the minister Vitaliy Radetskyy about the 
soundness of the three presidents' decision. 
  I think that the key to this paradox is fairly simple. In 
order to command strategic forces you have at least to have 
some, otherwise the number of posts is cut, which means a loss 
of power, privileges, and everything else which guarantees the 
rank of general. Therefore, the Ukrainian military's reaction 
is completely understandable. It is more difficult to explain 
the parliamentarians' behavior. Colonel General Yevgeniy 
Maslin, chief specialist in nuclear missiles at the Russian 
Ministry of Defense, told me about his recent appearance before 
Kiev deputies. For about an hour he explained to them how 
dangerous it is not only for Ukraine but for the whole Europe to 
continue to store nuclear weapons without proper maintenance and 
replacement of their components, after which questions were put 
to him in rapid succession, including for example: But how much 
will Russia be able to afford for the Ukrainian warheads? An 
example of how politics and trade are interconnected.... 
  Meanwhile, for some reason nobody is taking any interest in 
how much it will cost Russia to dismantle the "independent" 
[Ukrainian] munitions. Very likely much more than the $60 
million the United States has appropriated for this purpose. 
(Incidentally, even this money is not "compensation" from kindly 
Uncle Sam for hazardous work undertaken, nor is it disinterested 
aid, but merely an advance made against the Russian share in the 
contract for highly enriched uranium.) At the same time Russia 
has also agreed to provide Ukraine with fuel assemblies for 
nuclear power stations containing 100 tonnes of low-enriched 
uranium as the a first installment of the settlement for 200 
missile warheads which in the next 10 months should be 
transferred to our plants for dismantling. 
  If the Kiev politicians and generals do nevertheless manage 
to draw out this process, we may all regret the consequences. 
The price of procrastination is too high -- radiation respects 
no borders. Three SS-24 missile warheads which were recently 
urgently transported to Russia in a dangerous [predavariynyy] 
condition proved this. Due to periodic technical maintenance 
not being carried out at the proper time, hydrogen and other 
constituents began to accumulate in them resulting in a buildup 
of explosive gas. Apart from this, as time goes by nuclear 
munitions are subject to corrosion, the products of which are 
toxic and radioactive. There are after all 46 SS-24 missile 
launchers, 130 SS-19 launchers, and about 40 TU-160 and TU-95 
heavy bombers of the Navy, for which almost 670 long-range 
cruise missiles with nuclear warheads are in storage. 
  Missile complexes began to be wound down in November and the 
Ukrainian storage facilities are at this moment already 
overflowing with nose sections and nuclear weapons taken off 
alert status, which has significantly increased the background 
radiation. This is no empty claim but a fact confirmed by the 
chief designers from Arzamas-16 who have visited Pervomaysk. It 
is at the very least shortsighted and foolhardy not to take what 
they say into consideration. 
  There is one more side to the question. Next year the Treaty 
on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons runs out. If Ukraine 
does not become a party to it as a nonnuclear power, a dangerous 
precedent will be set for the whole world. In such 
circumstances the notorious "domino" effect cannot be ruled out 
as there are more than enough people wishing to follow this bad 
example, including those along Russia's southern borders. 
  We can only rely on the good sense of Kiev's politicians and 
the Ukrainian president's ability to carry out the adopted 
decisions and to keep to the obligations he signed with his own 
hand.

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Excerpt] And now I would like to dwell on the problems of 
nuclear weapons in the near abroad. The leadership of the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry is forcing the servicemen of the 
strategic missile units to take the Ukrainian military oath of 
allegiance. Aleksandr Znamenskiy is at our microphone with the 
details. 
  [Znamenskiy] Specifically what is being referred to is the 
43d Army. This army stationed on the territory of the Ukrainian 
Republic is armed with over 170 intercontinental missiles of the 
former Soviet Union. Their nuclear charges, together with other 
nuclear warheads situated on Ukraine's territory -- and there 
are some 2,000 units of them -- are to be taken to Russia and 
salvaged there in as short a time as possible. This was agreed 
by the presidents of Russia, the United States and Ukraine at a 
recent meeting in Moscow. It would seem that there would no 
longer be any problems as regards nuclear missile weapons in 
Ukraine. However, at the sitting of the collegium of Ukraine's 
Defense Ministry which took place the other day the commander of 
the 43rd Army and his subordinate, the commander of one of the 
divisions, were compelled to take the Ukrainian oath of 
allegiance. And today all servicemen of the strategic missile 
units are also being instructed to take the oath of allegiance 
to Ukraine. The Russian military believe that all these 
unilateral steps by Kiev are a gross violation of the 
American-Russian-Ukrainian nuclear accords reached in Moscow . 
They are not in line either with the agreement on the status of 
strategic nuclear forces signed by the heads of CIS as far back 
as February 1992. 
  Describing Ukraine's military leaders who take such 
decisions, head of the chief directorate of Russia's Defense 
Ministry Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin said that they are 
people who want to remain in the seats of the new structures for 
the exploitation of nuclear weapons and to this end they need 
assistants in the form of a dedicated officer corps. And it is 
for this reason that the Ukrainisation of the officer corps is 
proceeding artifically in Ukraine. 
  Meanwhile the number of officers wishing to serve in 
Ukraine's missile units is steadily dropping. Today almost 
every second servicemen is seeking to continue his service in 
Russia. What is more, while previously the missilemen in Russia 
and Ukraine, united by one oath of allegiance, in the face of 
all difficulties, ensured the required level of nuclear safety, 
now all this is out of the question . With the adoption of the 
Ukrainian oath of allegiance, the command of the Russian 
strategic missile troops is completely losing the possibility of 
running the 43d Army. The set aim of Ukraine's military to 
completely control the nuclear forces on the republic's 
territory is being carried out in practice. The situation that 
has arisen calls into doubt the reality of the fulfilment of the 
Ukrainian side of its nuclear obligations and without 
exaggeration could lead to a disaster worse than the Chernobyl 
one. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Donetsk -- At a news conference on 2 February Oblast 
Council Chairman Vadym Chuprun reported on the outcome of the 
meeting of the chairmen of the oblast councils and state 
administrations of 10 Ukrainian and Russian border oblasts, 
which took place in Belgorod on 29 January. Its participants 
considered the draft regulations which will be worked up in two 
weeks and which will determine the principles of mutual 
relations between the neighboring oblasts. 
  According to Vadym Chuprun, the meeting proved that there 
are 
no discrepancies among the leaders of the oblasts, that all 
disputable issues relate mostly to customs service and the 
border, but they should be tackled at the interstate level. At 
the previous meeting of oblast leaders they discussed the issue 
on granting them the status of border zones which would 
contribute to establishing normal mutual relations. This issue 
was to be solved by the governments of both countries. 
Unfortunately, Vadym Chuprun pointed out, while Russia did take 
certain steps in this direction, the Ukrainian Government did 
not respond to the appeal by the participants in the Belgorod 
meeting. The current meeting approved an appeal to Leonid 
Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin with the request to help establish 
normal neighborly relations between the neighboring states.

  [Text] Russia believes that the Black Sea Fleet problem 
should be solved immediately on the basis of the relevant 
protocol signed by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents in 
Massandra September 3, 1993. This is stated in a telegram sent 
by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to the chairman 
of the Sevastopol City Council, Viktor Semyonov, reports the 
newspaper "Slava Sevastopolya." 
  The telegram says that the Russian delegation at the talks 
on 
the Black Sea Fleet is prepared to discuss with the Ukrainian 
delegation, within the shortest possible period, the problems 
associated with the drafting of an understanding, according to 
which the Fleet with its entire infrastructure in Crimea is to 
be used by Russia and fly Russian flags. 
  For its part, the Russian delegation will pay for the part 
of 
the Fleet, including the infrastructure, which in line with 
previous agreements should be part of Ukraine, says the telegram. 
  On Tuesday, in an interview with Interfax, the Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister favored the idea of the Fleet's problem being 
solved on the basis of the Yalta agreements, not the Massandra 
ones. 
  In the summer of 1992, the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, 
Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin, signed near Yalta the 
agreement according to which Russia and Ukraine would create 
their Naval forces on the basis of the Black Sea Fleet. During 
their creation, the Fleet would be subordinate to both 
presidents. 
  On September 3, 1993, in Massandra (Black Sea southern 
coast), the two presidents signed agreements according to which 
Ukraine was to hand over to Russia its part of the Fleet as 
repayment of the debt for earlier supplies of Russian energy.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by Diplomatic </F>
Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry is not inclined to 
attach too much importance to Ukrainian officials' statements 
advocating a revision of the Massandra agreements on the Black 
Sea Fleet, a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax. 
  He said that these statements must not be taken seriously 
because they were made "in the heat" of the election campaign in 
Crimea. 
  To quote the diplomat, in Massandra the Russian and 
Ukrainian 
presidents agreed that the Black Sea Fleet would be Russian. 
"The talk about changes in Ukraine's official position and about 
a roll- back to the Yalta agreements, according to which the 
Black Sea Fleet was equally divided between Russian and Ukraine, 
might be resumed only if President Kravchuk made a corresponding 
statement," he said. 
  Russia will not depart from the Massandra agreements, a 
high- 
ranking Defense Ministry official told Interfax. 
  He said that the Defense Ministry continued work on new 
agreements that would supplement the Massandra accord. 
  He noted in particular that some of the actions by the 
Ukrainian side contradict with these agreements. "Thus, on 
Wednesday, February 2, the Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev sent a response to his Ukrainian counterpart Vitaly 
Radetsky in which he opposed Kiev's initiative to institute the 
post of commander of the Sevastopol military district," he said. 
"Why should we institute a separate post if it is already 
occupied by the commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard 
Baltin, nominated by the presidents of the two countries?" 
  "Suppose we resumed the discussion of the fleet division. 
What then? Even in better times Kiev financed only 16 percent 
of the Black Sea Fleet's needs. Ukraine cannot afford the Black 
Sea Fleet and will auction it off. It is also clear that this 
will not benefit either Russia's or Ukraine's defense 
capability," he said.

  [Text] Russia has not yet presented a timetable for troop 
withdrawal from Estonia even though one was expected at the 
present round of Estonian-Russian talks which took place near 
Moscow yesterday and today. Juri Kahn, Estonian ambassador to 
Moscow, who is the leader of the economic issues working group 
at the talks on the Estonian side, told Estonian Radio that 
Russia has promised to present a timetable for the troop 
withdrawal if Estonia accepts the agreement on Russian military 
pensioners as designed by Russia. 
  According to Juri Kahn, Estonia and Russia did not sign any 
documents during this round of talks. However, some were 
prepared, to be signed at the next round of talks. This is due 
at Lohusalu in Estonia on 1 and 2 March.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "Everything Hangs on Signing a </F>
Fundamental Treaty. Russia Is Linking This Closely with 
Schedule for Withdrawing Its Troops from Estonia"] 
  [Text] The latest round of talks between Estonia and Russia 
began outside Moscow yesterday. The agenda included the 
traditional package of questions regarding troop withdrawal and 
problems to do with borders and the humanitarian, legal, and 
economic aspects of cooperation. For the first time, the 
delegation from the Republic of Estonia will be headed at the 
talks by Reino Reinart, chief of the Department for 
International Organizations and Security at the republic's 
Foreign Ministry, who has been given the diplomatic rank of 
ambassador. It is well known that Juri Luik, the former head of 
the Estonian delegation, has been appointed Estonian foreign 
minister. 
  In the opinion of Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, the 
priority issue at these talks remains the fastest possible 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonian territory. The 
Estonian side hopes that Russia will submit a written schedule 
for withdrawing its troops. Laar believes that once this is 
done, the republic will have the opportunity to reach agreement 
with Russia as soon as possible on creating conditions for 
implementing the schedule, and "by 31 August the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Estonia will be complete." 
  On the eve of the talks, Vladimir Tsivinskiy, secretary to 
the Russian delegation at the talks with Estonia, noted in an 
interview with your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent that there are 
plans to submit a schedule for withdrawing troops. At the same 
time, Tsivinskiy stressed, this act directly depends on a number 
of factors, the most important of which is the willingness of 
the two sides to sign a fundamental treaty on the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Estonia.

  [Text] Yesterday another round of Russian-Estonian 
interstate talks began in Nakhabino, near Moscow. The program 
of discussion includes military, humanitarian, economic, and 
border problems. The Estonian side is primarily interested in a 
detailed schedule for the pullout of Russian troops from 
Estonia. The Estonian delegation is ready to agree to the 
Russian proposal on the final withdrawal date (31 August 1994) 
only if Estonia gets a schedule providing for a priority pullout 
of combat units and subdivisions. Vasiliy Svirin, chief Russian 
negotiator, said last week that such a detailed document has 
been prepared and it specifies the date for the relocation of 
each military unit. The schedule will be presented during the 
talks. Vyano Reynar, Estonia's ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary, who has replaced Juri Luik at the post of chief 
Estonian negotiator, has expressed the hope that in spite of a 
number of contradictions, the main treaty on the pullout of 
Russian troops will be ratified after all. At the same time Ago 
Tiyman, the delegation's executive secretary and head of its 
military group, stressed that Estonia would like the Russian 
side not to link economic and political problems, in particular 
the issue of human rights. It is precisely for this reason, he 
thinks, that the fully elaborated and prepared agreements and 
treaties on economic matters have not been signed yet.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- Estonia refused to discuss 
the possibility of granting the Russian minority the freedom of 
acquiring Estonian citizenship and demanded that a part of 
Russian retired military should withdraw from the republic 
together with the troops. 
  "We hoped that the resolution of the UN General Assembly 
adopted last December, which pointed to unsettled problems in 
Estonia concerning big ethnic groups, mostly Russians, will be 
correctly comprehended in Tallinn", Vasiliy Svirin, head of the 
Russian delegation at talks with Estonia, told a press 
conference on Wednesday after the end of the 16th round of talks. 
  "We called on Estonia to begin a concrete discussion of a 
draft agreement on settling the citizenship problem which has 
been on the negotiating table for two years without any progress 
because Estonia had blocked it", he said and added that the 
Estonian delegation refused to work on the agreement. 
  The document grants Russians in Estonia and Estonians in 
Russia the right to acquire the Estonian or Russian citizenship 
on a free basis. 
  Svirin also said that Estonia demanded that Russian military 
who retired after the abortive Soviet coup in August 1991 be 
withdrawn from the Baltic state together with Russian troops, 
but agreed that 9,670 military who retired before that can count 
on receiving a residence permit. 
  "The issue of deporting a considerable number of retired 
military is put on the agenda", Svirin commented. 
  The deportation problem may diminish the "considerable 
progress" which, according to Svirin, was reached on the draft 
agreement on the Russian pullout. He added that the agreement 
might be initialled in the near future, but the deportation 
problem had now emerged. 
  The Russian chief negotiator said that Russia had for the 
first time warned Estonia, which categorically refuses to 
jointly demarcate the border with Russia, that it has to begin 
doing the job by itself.

  [Text] A working meeting of experts from the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan is continuing in 
Moscow. They are discussing the status of the Baykonur 
cosmodrome and the town of Leninsk and conditions for their use. 
At the moment the Kazakh side is still refusing to recognize 
Baykonur as a Russian military base and is insisting on its 
demilitarization, since Kazakhstan's constitution stipulates 
that there must not be any foreign military bases on the 
republic's territory.

  [Text] The second day of Russian-Kazakh talks in Moscow 
Tuesday on conditions for leasing the Baykonur cosmodrome has 
not brought the two sides closer to agreement. 
  The representative of the Russian Space Agency, who took 
part 
in the talks, told INTERFAX that the talks are proceeding with 
difficulty. He said that the issues associated with the sum of 
compensation for the use of launching sites and the coordination 
of the system of the legal regulation of relationships among the 
cosmodrome personnel were postponed for the last day of talks, 
Wednesday. 
  The Russian Space Agency's representative said that during 
the talks Russian experts named the sum of the lease, which 
Russia is prepared to pay, and offered its feasibility studies 
(he refused to name the figure). He told INTERFAX, however, 
that the Kazakh side has made no response. 
  Russian experts tend to explain the passiveness of the 
Kazakh 
delegation by the ambiguity of its stance. According to 
information obtained by INTERFAX, Kazakhstan, despite the 
understanding reached in Almaty in mid-January on giving up the 
idea of creating on the Baykonur basis an international 
joint-stock company, still gives it much emphasis, for example, 
within the framework of the bilateral meetings with U.S. experts 
(an American 13-member delegation recently visited the 
cosmodrome at the invitation of Kazakhstan). 
  Russian experts believe that Kazakhstan's uncertainty should 
go away after President Nazarbayev discusses issues of the U.S.- 
Kazakhstan outer space cooperation (including the U.S. possible 
involvement in the use of Baykonur) during his visit to 
Washington scheduled for mid-February. Experts believe that the 
future of the Russian-Kazakh agreement on leasing the cosmodrome 
depends directly on the results of the talks in Washington. 
  The agency spokesman following the three-day talks in Moscow 
said the two sides will sign a list of concrete problems on 
which they agree or disagree.

  [Text] A report which has appeared in Turkey's HURRIYET is 
worrying. It essentially says that Russian and Ukrainian civil 
airliners are transporting arms from Syria to Armenia. 
  The conclusion was drawn on the basis that Turkish Air Force 
technical devices have apparently registered the landing in 
Yerevan of airplanes which have not stopped over in Odessa and 
Sochi. But, as your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent was told 
at the Russian Federation Air Transportation Department, such 
flights are scarcely possible without the sanction of official 
aviation authorities. 
  Admittedly, a lot of private air companies have appeared 
recently which do not come under the control of ministries or 
departments. Once they have licenses for international 
transportation, they practically cease to be supervised by state 
organs.

<F P=106> [Feature comprising article by Special Envoy Sergey Zotov, </F>
head of the Russian delegation to the talks with Latvia, 
followed by editorial commentary, under the general headline: 
"Moscow's Tough Reaction to Arrest of Russian Generals in 
Latvia Was Justified"] 
  [Text] [Zotov] The editorial published in IZVESTIYA (No. 
8) under the headline "Arrest of Two Russian Generals in Latvia 
Is Lesson for Moscow and Riga" pursued the idea that the placing 
of relevant Army and Navy units on alert status in connection 
with the 10 January seizure of four Northwest Group of Forces 
installations and two Russian generals in Riga 10 January by 
Latvian militia shows that there is weak civilian control over 
the Armed Forces and that the decision was reached without the 
necessary coordination among the presidential apparatus, the 
Security Council, and other competent structures. 
  There is no doubt that in a democratic state there should be 
effective civilian control over the use of the Armed Forces. 
  Nor can there be any objection to the premise advanced in 
the 
article that we should resort to this obviously extreme measure 
only after considering the potential for safeguarding citizens 
by diplomatic means. 
  As for the aforementioned incident in Riga, which was 
extremely brazen and unprecedented, apart from its emotional 
aspect (the capture of generals is always viewed in Russia like 
the loss of military colors) it was a blatant violation of 
international law. And the numerous illegal acts previously 
undertaken against Russian servicemen in Latvia constituted 
aggravating circumstances. 
  In late December 1993 there was a new series of 
provocations, 
including an attack on a military courier service and two 
instances of militia shelling of military transportation. There 
was an escalation of unpunished provocations against Russian 
troops, culminating in the events of 10 January, which were 
timed to coincide with the Russian delegation's arrival in Riga. 
  Even after the Latvian president announced his readiness to 
take the proper measures, it took five hours before the Russian 
generals were released, during which time our citizens were 
threatened with being shot. The Russian side also took account 
of the fact that the militia is virtually beyond executive 
jurisdiction when it took measures to protect the lives and 
honor of the Russian generals. 
  I want to assure IZVESTIYA readers that Colonel General L.S. 
Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces, behaved 
superbly in a difficult situation and was in constant contact 
with the Russian state delegation from the time we arrived at 
Riga airport. Defense Minister P.S. Grachev and Foreign 
Minister A.V. Kozyrev, who issued a long statement, were 
immediately informed about what had happened. The supreme 
commander in chief -- President B.N. Yeltsin -- was immediately 
informed too. So it would be wrong to imagine that the measures 
taken were some kind of "freelance" military operation. 
  As for the actual nature of Russia's military measures, in 
our delegation's opinion they were the only correct thing to do, 
since they stopped the incident fromescalating into a conflict 
with unforeseeable consequences. 
  I particularly want to stress that, if we had limited our 
reaction to a statement, this would have been seen by radical 
nationalist forces as a signal to move to even more unbridled 
provocations against our servicemen, against the thousands of 
military pensioners and their families, and against the Russian 
population, which is trying to win respect for its rights. 
  May I voice the view that we have still not yet fully 
grasped the importance of this seemingly insignificant 
military-diplomatic step in terms of our foreign policy, the 
awakening of our national self-awareness, and the boosting of 
morale among our Armed Forces. The cherished desire of Russia's 
professional diplomats and of all our countrymen who value our 
national interests in deeds rather than words is for the steps 
taken by Russia 10 January become the starting point for a new 
presidential policy and a new foreign policy for Russia. 
  Russia has firmly and clearly stated, perhaps more than ever 
before, that it is still a great power and that nobody will be 
allowed to deliver ultimatums to it, pressure it, or blackmail 
it. Those planning new provocations against Russia and its 
citizens now know that there will be a swift and appropriate 
response on our part taking account of international precedents, 
including the U.S. experience. 
  This is nothing to do with "imperial ambitions." We are 
merely talking about a state's right and, I would say, its duty 
to use all means available to it in international practice to 
protect its honor and the national dignity of its citizens. I 
am sure that if we consistently and steadily follow this line in 
practice we will be able to avoid in the future a great deal of 
the trouble that is currently visible on the foreign policy 
horizon. 
  And, on the contrary, if we "give up" this position under 
pressure from people offering us "good advice," we will again 
encounter attempts to diminish our national worth and come up 
against new problems for our state. 
  Anticipating the reaction of our possible opponents, I would 
like to say that there is nothing short-term about these 
arguments of mine. The Russian delegation at the talks with 
Latvia has always, despite the obstacles raised, consistently 
and successfully pursued this line in strict accordance with the 
directives ratified by the Russian president. [Zotov ends] 
<H5>  Great Powers Still Not Defined by Military Might </H5>
  [IZVESTIYA] Having a strong position is any diplomat's 
dream. The question is: What is to be considered a strong 
position? What result did the Russian military men and 
diplomats achieve in demonstrating their readiness to use force? 
Initially, after the provocative arrest of the two generals, 
Latvian diplomats were indeed prepared to make concessions, and 
Ambassador Sergey Zotov decided that airborne assault battalions 
would be the most convincing argument at the talks. 
  But Riga's confusion was quickly over. And not because the 
Latvians were not frightened enough. On the contrary, it was 
clear to Latvian politicians (and not only them) that it was 
necessary to be as stubborn as possible in getting the Russian 
Army to withdraw and in cutting themselves off from Russian 
generals behind an iron or any other kind of curtain. 
  Did this show of force make the Russians living in the 
Baltic 
any more secure? Probably just the opposite. The position of 
Russian people is affected badly by any attempts to pressure the 
Balts; the Russians have become hostages to Russian policy. In 
this sense the armed force was absolutely impotent. 
  So what advantage was gained? 
  Morale improved sharply not only among generals, as 
IZVESTIYA 
had assumed, but among diplomats too. It turns out that even 
diplomats like banging their fists on the table. 
  You can understand why. The behavior of the Latvian 
officials with whom the Russian diplomats and military have to 
deal -- whether they like it or not -- betrays the triumph of a 
provincial arrogance that has suddenly recognized its own power. 
  But it must not be forgotten that the tricks both big and 
small that have been played by the Baltic officials had just one 
cause -- the presence on their country's territory of another 
state's army, whose withdrawal they are demanding as quickly as 
possible. 
  There is also another issue -- the appropriateness of the 
response. Almost nine years ago, when Mikhail Gorbachev had 
been in power for just two weeks, a Soviet soldier from the 
Group of Forces in Germany shot the American Major Nicholson. 
It had seemed to the vigilant guard than the American was 
trying to discover some secrets. 
  So, following the logic of Ambassador Zotov, who values 
American experience, just how should the United States have 
reacted? If assault troops are placed on combat alert when 
people are arrested, should the response to a killing be a 
missile strike against the enemy? 
  Fortunately for everyone, the United States restricted 
itself 
to diplomatic measures, and there is no reason to believe that 
it ceased being a great power at that point. 
  So IZVESTIYA would by no means want the events of 10 January 
to be considered the "starting point for a new Russian foreign 
policy."

<F P=106> [Irina Litvinova report: "Moscow Intends To Take Latvia's </F>
Gas Debts in Industrial Property"] 
  [Text] Riga -- More than $27 million -- that is what 
Latvia owes Russia for natural gas supplies. This figure has 
been reported in the Latvian media for the first time. 
  Judging from officials' reports, the debt has built up 
steadily. Having turned into a chronic defaulter, the "Latviyas 
Gaze" ("Latvian Gas") state enterprise is also committed to pay 
considerable sums in fines to its Russian suppliers. Last year 
the money owing to Russia for its natural gas supplies was paid 
off with the help of international loans. Since then the 
situation has not changed for the better. 
  The leaders of "Latviyas Gaze" reported that this year an 
agreement with Russia on gas deliveries had been concluded on 
"terms advantageous to the Latvian side." Nonetheless, it has 
not proved possible to pay the sum required. It is as if Latvia 
is receiving gas on credit. The DIENA newspaper has reported 
that Russia issued an official warning in mid-January to the 
"Latviyas Gaze" state enterprise, demanding that it change its 
payment policy for the gas it has used. It is proposed that 
this demand be met by 1 February, otherwise gas supplies will be 
cut by 50 percent. 
  But Latvian consumers are not threatened with any particular 
unpleasantness as a result of this reduction in the supply of 
Russian natural gas. The fact is that Europe's largest 
underground gas storage facility, into which Russian gas has 
constantly been pumped, is located in the republic at Incukalns. 
  Russia has agreed to forgive the debts in return for part of 
the Incukalns gas storage facility and the network of gas 
pipelines running across Latvian territory.

  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- Russia can be admitted to 
the Council of Europe not earlier than the end of 1994, 
according to a delegation of the Russian Federal Assembly that 
recently returned from a session of the Council of Europe 
Inter-Parliamentary Assembly in France. 
  The delegation included deputy chairman of the Council of 
the 
Federation, the upper house of the new parliament, Ramazan 
Abdulatipov, Deputies Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, Sergey Baburin, 
Sergey Glotov, Aleksandr Dzasokhov and Vladimir Podoprigora. 
  Russia's admittance to the Council of Europe should be 
preceded by visits to Russia of the heads of some of its 
committees and council leaders, Ambartsumov said. He said the 
visit to France aimed at restoring ties between the Russian 
parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly which have been 
suspended after the 1993 October revolt in Moscow. "We think 
this goal was achieved," he added. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, the 
members of the delegation said that Russia's admittance to the 
Council of Europe in being artificially delayed, which signifies 
that Western parliamentarians are concerned about the situation 
in Russia. 
  Abdulatipov stressed that the visit "was a good start of 
coordinated activities of both houses of the Federal Assembly." 
He said the parliament should set up a permanent delegation of 
about 18 people in the interests of future visits. The 
delegation should include representatives of all factions of the 
parliament.

  [Text] Geneva February 2 TASS -- Now it is important to 
give a good and energetic start to the U.N. disarmament 
conference, which is encountering new difficult problems, above 
all, the task of working out an international treaty on a 
universal ban on nuclear tests, Russia's permanent 
representative in the conference Grigoriy Berdennikov said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [2 February]. 
  Berdennikov noted Russia's principle readiness to go in for 
concluding at present such a treaty, which can be subjected to 
checking, and emphasised that Russia will construct its stand at 
the talks in such a way that they are mainly completed, possibly 
by the spring of 1995. 
  The Russian delegation attaches top priority to the nuclear 
test ban talks in 1994, Berdennikov said. According to him, the 
question of the scope of the treaty should be decided on the 
basis of already existing international accords, above all, the 
Moscow treaty of 1963, which bans nuclear tests in three 
mediums, of course, with the inclusion of a ban on underground 
tests. Russia advocates an unlimited and non-discriminatory 
character of the treaty and equal rights and responsibilities of 
all its participants, he said. 
  The agreement should apply not only to nuclear states, but 
also to those which are capable of making nuclear weapons. The 
treaty should come into force after the submission of 
ratification deeds, provided they include deeds of all states, 
which possess nuclear power plants and research reactors at the 
time of signing the document. There is a need to impose the 
strictest sanctions on participating countries which violate its 
main statutes, right up to imposing economic or other measures 
of compulsions stipulated by the UN Charter. 
  The delegation also favours working out a multilateral 
agreement on guarantees of the security of non-nuclear states.

  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- A French military 
delegation led by Defence Minister Francois Leotard arrived in 
Moscow on Wednesday. 
  This is the first official visit to Russia by Leotard since

mutual contacts, delegation exchanges and training Russian 
servicemen in France and their French colleagues in Russia. 
  Leotard also plans to meet with First Vice-Prime Minister 
Oleg Soskovets and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev who visited 
France in the autumn of 1993. During the visit they signed 
bilateral agreements on cooperation to dismantle nuclear weapons 
in Russia and ensure their safe transportation.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Satisfaction in Moscow"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 2 Feb -- The report that the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] authorities have provided CSCE 
states with information on their military forces -- their status 
as of 1 January 1994 -- for the first time since the collapse of 
former Yugoslavia has been welcomed with satisfaction in Russia. 
This was stated at a briefing by G. Karasin, director of the 
Foreign Ministry Department of Information and the Press. 
  A document distributed by FRY representatives in Vienna 
notes 
that the Yugoslav Army does not plan to deploy additional 
categories of heavy weapons or operational systems on its 
territory in 1994, the Russian Foreign Ministry representative 
reported. 
  "The provision of data about the stationing of troops and 
their armaments in conditions of constant combat action in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina is evidence, in our opinion, of the FRY's 
commitment to solving the problems of military security and 
stability in the region," Karasin noted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gerhard Frey, leader of German People's </F>
Union, by Boris Vinogradov; place and date not given: "Gerhard 
Frey: `I Love Zhirinovskiy and Russia'"] 
  [Text] As a German newspaper has written, their friendship 
flared like a torch in the hands of storm troopers during the 
night of the "long knives." The symbolism really does appear 
sinister if you consider the fact that the first meeting between 
Gerhard Frey and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy took place in Germany 
while preparations were being made there to celebrate the 60th 
anniversary of Hitler's accession to power, and their second 
meeting took place in Moscow while the 50th anniversary of the 
lifting of the siege of Leningrad was being celebrated in Russia. 
  What do the leader of the "German People's Union" and the 
leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party have in common? 
  Considering himself the "best friend" of the German people, 
just as Frey is of the Russian people, Vladimir Volfovich cannot 
understand why he was refused a German visa. Frey is bringing 
an action against the FRG Embassy and is threatening to win the 
case, because he has not lost a single court case in his entire 
busy life. 
  Tell me who your friend is.... Evidently knowing this 
Russian proverb, at the start of our conversation Gerhard Frey 
uttered very flattering words about Zhirinovskiy as the future 
president of Russia. 
  [Vinogradov] Did you know, Dr. Frey, that our readers know 
you as an extremist, a neo-Nazi, and publisher of the 
ultraright-wing newspaper NATIONALZEITUNG? 
  [Frey] I have never been either a Nazi or, still less, a 
fascist, as the former communist press used to portray me. I 
always struggled for my motherland's reunification, but I was 
seen as someone who does not recognize the postwar borders and 
who demands revanche. 
  In my opinion, the point is that, having lost an enemy in 
the 
guise of communism, German journalism, which was created 
according to U.S. standards and licenses after the war, lives on 
old notions. A new enemy image is now being foisted onto German 
society -- in the person of my friend Zhirinovskiy and, thus, in 
the person of the Russian voters who voted for him. 
  [Vinogradov] Did you fall in love with Russia long ago? 
After making Zhirinovskiy's acquaintance? 
  [Frey] I have always loved Russia. Our peoples have much in 
common. When Russia and Germany were together, the world only 
benefited from that. We suffered the greatest losses, and the 
memory of the millions who died must be a guarantee that we 
never again end up as enemies. 
  Let us recall history. Russia saved Frederick the Great in 
the Seven Years' War and saved Europe and Germany from Napoleon, 
and even in the early twenties, despite the difference in the 
systems, the treaty of Rapallo was made possible. Zhirinovskiy 
and I advocate the implementation of a friendly policy in Moscow 
and Berlin, and then our countries will once again occupy a 
worthy place in the world arena. Russia is having a hard time 
now, and we must help it to surmount the crisis. 
  [Vinogradov] How do you rate Zhirinovskiy's calls for the 
borders in Europe to be changed? Are they consonant with your 
wishes to return to Germany the lands lost after the war? 
  [Frey] What, in fact, are you talking about? European 
borders have long been being redrawn. Examples of this are 
provided by Germany, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet 
Union. Next came Belgium, Canada, Italy, Ireland.... The 1975 
Helsinki Act is a dead document. The Oder-Neisse line is not a 
God-given border once and for all. We should proceed from the 
peoples' right to self-determination. If the population of 
Crimea, for example, or Belarus wishes to reunite with Russia, 
who can prevent this? It is perfectly possible that in five or 
10 years' time Warsaw will wish to discuss with us the return of 
Silesia. 
  [Vinogradov] But what about Kaliningrad Oblast, the former 
East Prussia? 
  [Frey] I do not doubt that in the future our countries will 
find a mutually acceptable way to resolve this problem too. 
After all, we have to correct the injustice perpetrated against 
Germans driven from their primordial lands, be they Pomerania, 
Sudetenland, or Silesia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader </F>
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Fulvio Scaglione in Moscow; date not 
given: "Hands Off Russia"] 
  [Text] "In the fall it will be our turn to govern. 
Meanwhile I am resting." This was said by Russia's bugbear, 
the Black Specter in politics Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and winner in the latest 
elections, but he was not telling the truth. Some rest: He 
travels, sees, meets, makes speeches, shakes his fist in the 
corridors of the Duma (the Russian parliament), and he gives a 
few interviews, such as this. 
  [Scaglione] You are about to visit Belgrade. Are you pleased 
with the document in support of Serbia approved by the new Duma? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, partly because the document stemmed from 
an initiative on our part. We told Kozyrev (foreign minister -- 
FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA editor's note) clearly: Unless you adopt a 
pro-Serbian stance right away, we will make you resign. We have 
no doubts: We are with the Serbs. 
  [Scaglione] How can the war in the former Yugoslavia be 
ended? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is enough to remove all the foreign armed 
forces. Let us remove them, then you will see how order will 
return. 
  [Scaglione] You will be visiting Poland, where you are not 
much liked. Why? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I will be visiting Poland, true -- but 
Slovenia, too -- and I have been to Bulgaria. I am in 
solidarity with them: We should form a community of Slavic 
states together, but with no ideology, no pan-Slavism. This is 
demanded by the compactness of our territories, our customs, our 
history, and our culture. Be that as it may, the Poles must not 
be afraid: We are in favor of the inviolability of borders. 
Unfortunately we are forced to defend ourselves because the 
West is trying to change ours, despite the accords signed in 
Helsinki in 1975. 
  [Scaglione] I beg your pardon? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Those accords envisaged the inviolability of 
borders in Europe. Why, then, were the Soviet Union's borders 
changed? Who gave them the right to do that? France cannot be 
touched. We will not even mention Germany. Only in Yugoslavia, 
Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union have the borders been 
changed -- as it so happens, the Slavic countries. These are 
double standards: How can we be happy with that? There is 
nothing fascist about it. They call us fascists to denigrate us 
and to frighten our supporters. They will pay for it: We have 
sued Yegor Gaydar over this, and have demanded 100 million 
[currency unspecified] in damages. 
  [Scaglione] Why do you take issue with the West so much? Not 
long ago you said that Russia needed technology and aid. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This business of Western aid is just a 
provocation. Nobody gives us a cent: In fact they only come 
here to take. This IMF is just an illusion; it does us harm, 
and that is all. The tide of profiteers will gradually be 
eliminated: By 1995 we will have thrown them all out, we will 
have a new government and a new policy. 
  [Scaglione] Is there no European political leader that you 
respect? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] None. They all hate Russia. But we will get 
along on our own -- and better. 
  [Scaglione] If it is as you say, why sell so many weapons 
abroad? To China, for instance? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We will continue to sell weapons everywhere. 
Whoever wants to buy will always be welcome. But we will ensure 
that our weapons do not end up in the hands of those who have 
aggressive intentions with respect to Russia. So to our 
neighboring countries we will sell only defensive weapons, while 
to distant countries we will also sell offensive weapons. 
  [Scaglione] Do you not consider this a harmful attitude for 
you to take? You are not even allowed to enter Germany. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This is already the second time that I have 
been refused a visa. The first time, last year, I organized a 
picket outside their embassy in Moscow, and after two hours my 
visa was ready. But that is not the important thing: I will be 
visiting Spain, Norway, Australia. There are many countries 
that I still have to visit. In any case, this time the picket 
was not necessary: My German friends and colleagues organized 
one outside their Foreign Ministry. Not bad, would you not say? 
Be that as it may, Germany is a country with limited 
sovereignty, a colony of the United States and the Zionists. 
What kind of freedom are they talking about? The freest 
country in the world is Russia. The strongest country in the 
world is Russia. And Russia's largest party is the Liberal 
Democratic Party, my party. Freedom is here, in my office. 
Germany is a colony where foreign troops have resided for 50 
years, plagued by 4 million Turks whom the Germans are starting 
to burn alive in their homes. That is fascism. 
  [Scaglione] No cooperation with anyone, then? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] On the contrary. I am in favor of joint 
projects. For instance, we should build a freeway from Germany 
to Japan via Russia. The traffic would be huge, and we Russians 
would stay home drinking tea and live off the transit tolls. 
Or: The Germans build good motors, we build excellent armor 
plate. Together, we could build the best tank in the world. We 
could take the Italians into space, and you could give us 
automobiles. There are opportunities. It is the European 
countries -- hostages of the United States and the Zionists -- 
that are reluctant. They eat, drink, and remain silent. And to 
think that it was we who saved them. 
  [Scaglione] I beg your pardon? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] In the 13th century, from the Mongols. In the 
18th century, from the Swedes. In the 19th century, from the 
French. In this century, from the Nazi-fascists. We confronted 
the Ottoman Empire, freeing the Balkans, Southern Europe, and 
Central Asia. We saved Israel, when we were the Soviet Union, 
and as Russia we saved Iraq. 
  [Scaglione] What is the status of your relations with 
President Yeltsin? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Good. We meet from time to time. He likes 
volleyball, and so do I. He is a good man, and he gives me no 
trouble. 
  [Scaglione] Are there no problems between you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Problems? Why should there be? He was 
deceived by Gaydar, Burbulis, and their group, and it is never 
pleasant to be conned. Now, having seen the results, he is 
trying to redress matters, but that is a difficult task. If I 
were in his shoes, I would already have expelled them from the 
country or put them in prison. But Yeltsin is a good man, and 
he is not doing anything to them. But I will not leave them 
alone; I will make sure that they pay the penalties envisaged by 
the criminal code for those who attack the state's security and 
prosperity. They know this, which is why they shout, "fascist, 
fascist." 
  [Scaglione] But will you take Yeltsin's place sooner or 
later? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Certainly. Through lack of rivals. Now, or 
in a year or two: It makes no difference. Yeltsin is finished 
politically, and look who is around -- Gaydar, Sobchak, Volskiy, 
Travkin, Yavlinskiy -- all people who command 10 percent of the 
votes. We have 120,000 members and received 12.3 million votes. 
In the next election it will be triple that. This is why they 
hate me: They know that I will be the next president.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Agafonov: "Japanese Waiting To See Whose </F>
View of the Territorial Problem Prevails in Moscow"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- For the first time in the past few weeks 
top officials have remembered Russia and said something about 
it. The occasion was the arrival of deputy Gennadiy Burbulis to 
attend an academic symposium on regional security matters. He 
was admitted to a reception at the premier's residence and to 
the office of the head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. 
  The former Russian state secretary's visit to Japan last 
September left behind the best possible memories in Tokyo, based 
primarily on what Japan saw as Burbulis' constructive approach 
to the territorial problem. For this trip the pragmatic hosts 
did strip Gennadiy Eduardovich of the title of Yeltsin's closest 
adviser, together with the description "influential," but they 
were well-disposed toward the visitor nonetheless. 
  Judging by available information, the meeting with the 
cabinet head lasted half an hour and was unremarkable. The 
visitor, placing special emphasis on the Russian president's 
efforts, set out to persuade the Japanese premier that the 
course of Russian reforms is continuing and is not going to 
change and that the new Russian Constitution that has been 
adopted lays the foundation for Russian political stability and 
creates an opportunity for the solution of a variety of 
problems, including bilateral Russian-Japanese ones. The host 
was rather more laconic and, having paid tribute to Yeltsin's 
visit to Japan last year, expressed the cautious hope that the 
reforms in Russia would actually develop and would not go off 
the road. 
  Burbulis conveyed greetings to the Japanese foreign minister 
from Kozyrev, who expressed a wish for regular meetings with the 
head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry for their mutual benefit. 
Inspired by the greetings, Minister Hata responded by saying 
that he is prepared to go to Russia and is even planning such a 
trip, although he strongly linked the fate of the visit and its 
date to the results of the upcoming Russian-Japanese 
consultations at the end of February. If the results of these 
talks are satisfactory from Japan's viewpoint, Hata will 
definitely go to Moscow. What will happen if that is not the 
case the minister did not say, although it is easy to guess. 
  Hata's linking the Russian visit to the outcome of the 
routine round of bilateral consultations with no 
earth-shattering tasks on their agenda is something new in the 
context of bilateral relations. It appears that the Japanese 
are tired of Russian vagueness and, fearful of Moscow's 
unpredictability, want to clarify matters, first by confirming 
the vitality and validity of all the accords that were reached 
during Yeltsin's visit to Japan last year. As far as one can 
tell, the Japanese scenario for the upcoming consultations is 
based on a kind of brief questionnaire demanding clear, 
unequivocal answers and opening with the number one question: 
Does Moscow acknowledge the existence of the territorial 
problem and is it prepared to continue the substantive dialogue 
on this problem? 
  In view of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's well-known stance 
on 
this question, which is at odds with the president's, it is 
understandable that the Japanese should want things defined. In 
this respect, the terms set out by the Japanese foreign minister 
look perfectly logical -- you have to know who your are dealing 
with: the Moscow that went to Tokyo with Yeltsin, or some other 
Moscow, one that has altered since the parliamentary elections 
and the establishment of a government of red directors.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "South Kurils: Fish in Exchange for </F>
Japanese and Korean Fuel"] 
  [Text] As of 31 January, South Korean and Japanese 
fishermen are permitted to catch, off the South Kurils, up to 10 
percent of fish and seafood procured annually in the area (about 
1.5 million tonnes) in exchange for fuel. Permission was issued 
by the Fishing Industry's Sakhalin Oblast Department on approval 
from the Russian Federation Committee on Fishing in connection 
with a shortage of funds to provide the islands with fuel oil, 
gasoline, and diesel oil. According to Aleksandr Medvedev, head 
of the Sakhalin administration fishing department, the Kurils 
thus will be able to get from Japan and South Korea 45,000 
tonnes of diesel fuel and 15,000 tonnes of fuel oil, quite 
sufficient to solve these islands' energy supply problem.

  [Text] Russia and Cuba are restoring traditional trade and 
economic cooperation and intend to enhance it. 
  The Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations told 
Interfax that the two states were to increase mutual deliveries 
of oil and sugar in 1994. Russia would export 4 Mn [million] 
tons of oil by the end of 1994 (instead of 2.5 Mn tons, the 
delivery of which was coordinated in late 1993) in exchange for 
2.5 Mn tons of cane sugar, exceeding the earlier expected volume 
of deliveries by 2.5 times. 
  According to Russian Foreign Economic Relations Minister 
Oleg 
Davydov, "Russia is very interested in importing Cuban sugar 
since it has big industrial capacities specially established for 
processing of cane sugar." 
  Russia and Cuba also intend to develop bilateral cooperation 
in other spheres. An International Russian-Cuban Trade Economic 
Association Roskuba was established last week in accordance with 
the inter-government agreement of December 24, 1993. The 
association includes more than 10 Russian state and commercial 
structures, for instance the joint stock companies 
Aeroflot--Russian Air Lines, Ingosstrakh, Vneshtreidinvest, 
Rosdetspetsprodukt, the state committee Rosvooruzhenie and the 
Russian Federation Trade Industrial Chamber. 
  The association's main purposes are to contribute to the 
development of trade, direct relations between enterprises and 
organizations, mutual utilization of industrial capacities and 
investment and to establishment of trans-national commercial, 
finance and industrial structures.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry circulated the text 
of the joint statement which was signed in Washington to 
consummate the 24-30 January negotiations between a Ukrainian 
government delegation led by Economics Minister Roman Shpek and 
the U.S. Administration's high-ranking officials. 
  The statement says that the negotiation focused on bilateral 
trade and economic relations, with the two sides having reached 
an agreement on a number of government initiatives to promote 
trade and extend to Ukraine the generalized system of 
preferences and on the U.S. support for Ukraine's (?accedence 
to) GATT. The statement says that the U.S. side greeted 
Ukraine's adherence to and observance of sanctions against 
Serbia and Montenegro, and took into account Ukraine's losses 
suffered as a result of it. 
  The United States attaches paramount importance to the 
success of democratic and market reforms in Ukraine, the 
statement says, and considering Ukraine's key stabilizing role 
in the region, regards its national, economic, and political 
security as extremely important for United States and European 
security. The United States also pledges to increase its 
technical and financial aid to Ukraine, particularly to finance 
private investments as well as urgent humanitarian aid to 
alleviate adverse social effects of the transnational [as heard] 
period. The United States also pledges to increase financing of 
safe and secure dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear weapons. The 
two sides agreed to convene in Kiev in March the first session 
of a mixed U.S.-Ukrainian committee for Ukraine's defense 
industry conversion. 
  The Ukrainian delegation also carried out some preparations 
for President Kravchuk's visit to the United States, slated for 
March 1994, which will allow to consider a bilateral charter of 
U.S.- Ukrainian partnership, friendship and cooperation, and 
sign a package of bilateral agreements.

  [Text] Kiev, 2 Feb -- The deputies considered and approved 
amendments and additions to the law of Ukraine on the taxation 
system. An explanatory note indicates that according to the law 
the taxation system is built on the principles of social 
justice. The law determines the conditions of taxation, the 
taxpayers, and the procedure of registering the objects of 
taxation. Two types of taxes are envisaged: state -- which are 
determined by the Supreme Council of Ukraine and are valid on 
the entire territory of Ukraine -- and local taxes and fees -- 
for example, advertisement fees, health resort fees, etc. The 
explanatory note indicates that the adoption of the law on the 
taxation system will promote the building of a taxation system 
that would comply with the demands of a transitional period. 
  The deputies approved changes to the procedural code of 
Ukraine in connection with the adoption of the law of Ukraine on 
the election of people's deputies. The code is supplemented 
with the "Statement on the abrogation of the decision of the 
district electoral commission on the registration of a candidate 
for people's deputy" and the "Complaints about the decisions and 
actions by the Central Elections Commission." 
  The deputies began considering a draft concept of developing 
the fuel and energy complex of Ukraine up to the year 2010. 
  Deputy Minister of Economy Volodymyr Hureyev made a report. 
Minister of Power Engineering and Electrification Vilen Semenyuk 
and Mykhaylo Kovalko, the chairman of DerzhKomNaftoHas [state 
oil and gas committee], delivered the second and third reports. 
The deputies approved a resolution consisting of two points: 
agreement in general with the draft concept of developing the 
fuel and energy complex of Ukraine up to the year 2010 and 
charging the cabinet of ministers with elaborating and approving 
a national program for the "Implementation of Ukraine's energy 
policy" proceeding from the above concept. An explanatory note, 
signed by acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zuyahilskyy, indicates 
that in the future it would be expedient to satisfy the national 
economy needs for electric power through the use of coal -- 50 
percent, uranium -- 40 percent, and the rest -- through the use 
of other energy sources. It is envisaged to satisfy the need 
for coal up to the year 2010 completely at the expense of our 
own resources. For this purpose it is necessary to begin 
digging 25 new mines. The possibility of building new thermal 
power stations is not ruled out, in particular, the building of 
a station in Chernigov Oblast that would solve the social issues 
of the collective of the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which 
will carry out intensive preparations for a stoppage. Ukraine's 
needs for oil and gas will be satisfied mainly at the expense of 
their import. 
  Fifteen trillion [as received] karbovantsi are required for 
the development of the coal industry by the year 2005 at the 
prices of the first quarter of last year. The extraction of 
coal in 2005 will amount to 160 million tons. Nine trillion 
karbovantsi are required for the development of the gas and oil 
industry. This will allow the output of oil in 2010 to increase 
to 7.5 million tons and gas to 30 billion cubic meters. 
Expenditures for carrying out measures to develop electric 
power engineering will amount to approximately 25 trillion 
karbovantsi.

  [Text] On Friday evening [28 January], Myechyslaw Hryb gave 
his first press conference as chairman of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet. 
  "The course of the Supreme Soviet will not change," 
announced 
Myechyslaw Ivanovich. "It depends on the deputies themselves 
rather than the chairman." 
  Speaking about his first moves in the new office, M. Hryb 
said that, first of all, one must examine the work of the 
Supreme Soviet which has become ineffective. The new chairman 
intends to cooperate with all deputies. At the same time, he 
stressed that he had good relations with the parliamentary 
opposition and was ready to listen to all of its constructive 
proposals. 
  M. Hryb is an advocate of a professional legislature. In his 
opinion, the work of the Supreme Soviet can be based on 
professionalism as of today. First of all, it is necessary to 
change the current mode of work. Myechyslaw Hryb proposed that 
deputies hold sessions for a week, and meet with constituents 
and draft laws over the next two weeks. According to his 
estimates, such regulations will not reduce the number of days 
spent in sessions. At the same time, this will enhance the 
deputies' efficiency. 
  "A statement is not a law," this is how the new chairman 
commented on the Supreme Soviet plans to hold early elections. 
He also stressed that this act required the adoption of a 
relevant law. On the other hand, the parliament speaker supports 
the idea of holding these elections this year. 
  According to M. Hryb, he has been Stanislav Shushkevich's 
supporter for a long time. The chairman noted that Stanislav 
Stanislavovich had many good traits which he failed to apply in 
his activities. His disagreements with Shushkevich were 
political. Hryb could not find a common language with him 
concerning Belarus' membership in the collective security system 
and the execution of adopted decisions. 
  The adoption of a constitution is a very complicated 
process. 
Myechyslaw Ivanovich noted that our deputies underrated this 
fact, and listed foreign countries as examples where 
constitutional processes lasted for decades. The new chairman 
spoke out for the introduction of a presidential office in 
Belarus. 
  "One may strive sincerely for sovereignty, but how can one 
achieve it if the Army of the neighboring country is present on 
our territory," said M. Hryb concerning this pressing issue. He 
stressed, however, that Belarus was an independent state which 
would seek neutral status. The new Supreme Soviet chairman 
emphasized that he had no disagreements with [Prime Minister] 
Vyacheslav Kebich. He noted that he was looking forward to the 
reorganization of the government capable of conducting 
successful reform.

Andrey Pershin, Andrey Petrovsky, and Vladimir Shishlin, edited 
by Boris Grishchenko] 
  [Text] The fact that the Belarusian parliament has a new 
leader does not mean that the political and economic policy in 
the republic will be changed. This was stated by the Supreme 
Soviet's Chairman Myecheslaw Hryb at a press conference in Minsk. 
  On a question put by an Interfax correspondent he answered 
that he highly appraised the merits of his predecessor. 
However, he pointed out that Stanislav Shushkevich had lacked 
"persistence in organization of coordinated activities of 
different deputies' groups and factions. This is why the new 
speaker must take this into consideration and correct this." 
  He emphasized that the peace-loving, friendly relations with 
neighbors, aspiration to neutrality and recognition of the 
established borders remained Belarusia's political priorities. 
  Hryb called a more dynamic transition to the market, 
rebuilding of the economy's structure and privatization the main 
domestic task. He recommended that a "serious economist" take 
the post of the Deputy of the Supreme Soviet's Chairman. 
  Hryb proposed that 43-year old Ivan Bambiza be nominated his 
deputy at the parliament's session on Wednesday. His candidacy 
will be discussed in the parliamentary committees and 
commissions. 
  According to the information received by deputies, Bambiza 
was born in the Gomel Region. He graduated from the Belarusian 
Institute of Agricultural machinery and received the diploma of 
a mechanical engineer in 1975. Recently, he has been the head 
of a regional administration and occupied the post of the 
Secretary of the Supreme Soviet's Planning and Budget Financial 
Commission.

  [Text] Almaty January 31 TASS -- "We welcome Vietnam's 
initiative to set up a joint commission to streamline economic 
relations. This will help expand cooperation in all spheres," 
Kazakhstan's Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko said. 
  The statement was made at the meeting with visiting 
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam in Almaty on Monday. 
  Tereshchenko stressed that Vietnam has accumulated rich 
experience in combating inflation, strengthening currency 
relations and developing the light industry. Kazakhstan and 
Vietnam could cooperate in establishing joint ventures to 
process agricultural produce and produce gas and oil, the prime 
minister added. 
  Kazakhstan has skilled geological cadres and could help 
Vietnam with gas and oil prospecting and training specialists, 
the premier said. 
  The Vietnamese minister recalled that Vietnam was one of the 
first countries to have recognised the independence of 
Kazakhstan. He believes further development of relations would 
be beneficial to both countries.

"Kyrgyzstan"] 
  [Text] A government meeting chaired by Prime Minister Apas 
Dzhumagulov was held in Bishkek to discuss the republic's 
economic performance in 1993. 
  Amangeldy Muraliyev, chairman of the State Economic 
Committee, emphasized that presently the country is experiencing 
a slump in production that looks set to worsen, because, on one 
hand, the stage of industrial restructuring has not yet begun, 
and on the other the diversification of forms of ownership has 
not yet reached a level where market mechanisms begin to work. 
In Muraliyev's view, it is clearly essential to pinpoint 
sectors to be financed on a priority basis down to the level of 
individual enterprises and industries; to work out a mechanism 
of tied credit and investment allocation; and to set up a 
special government commission to deal with the matters. The 
State Economic Committee chairman said that transformations in 
the agricultural sector have facilitated access to land for 
broad sectors of the population, helped agricultural enterprises 
achieve greater independence, and given private farmers a new 
lease on life. Hopes that a competitive environment will emerge 
following the introduction of new economic methods, however, 
have not been fulfilled. Muraliyev said that the objectives of 
financial stabilization require that a number of unpopular 
measures be taken in the short run. These include the freeing 
of bread and municipal services prices, the abandonment of 
licensing, and drastic cuts in loans to state-owned enterprises. 
We need to find an optimum compromise, he emphasized, between a 
tight monetary policy, the development of production, and the 
maintenance of the minimum living standards of the population. 
In his view this is not an easy task, but the national 
referendum demonstrated people's high degree of confidence in 
President Akayev and, hence, in reform. We should draw on this 
confidence, Muraliyev said, in order to carry out economic 
reform at this stage in a proper fashion.

Baltic countries are at the forefront in Europe in the fight for 
democracy and stability, and confirmed that reports coming from 
Moscow [as heard] cause anxiety in Estonia. Luik also stated 
that Estonia wants to have good relations with a democratic 
Russia. Only those countries who are certain of their security 
can be equal [word indistinct] partners for Russia, the foreign 
minister said. He also said that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania 
form a joint partnership [words indistinct] will be used in 
joint NATO actions within the partnership plan.

"Lithuania Switches to NATO Standards. Authorities Discuss 
Prospects for Relations With North Atlantic Bloc Experts"] 
  [Text] A NATO delegation arrived in Vilnius yesterday to 
hold consultations with the Lithuanian leaders, who signed the 
"Partnership for Peace" program last week. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of a coalition of right-wing 
opposition parties in the Lithuanian Seimas, who recently 
appears to be learning to find a common language with the 
centrists on matters of ensuring the republic's security, said 
that he welcomes the authorities' steps, particularly the 
initiative to hold the consultations. Mr. Landsbergis believes 
that "recent statements by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, the goings-on in Belarus and its statements addressed 
to Lithuania give ample reasons to talk about a threat to its 
territorial integrity." 
  Vytautas Landsbergis, as usual, did not forget to reproach 
the Lithuanian authorities for continuing talks with Russia on 
military transits through Lithuanian territory to Kaliningrad 
Oblast, which may drag the republic into CIS military 
cooperation. "Military transport movements to Russia's Baltic 
enclave," he concluded, "are permissible only on the basis of 
one-time, not long-term, agreements." 
  Meanwhile, President Brazauskas said on the eve of the North 
Atlantic bloc experts' arrival that Lithuania was ready to 
switch to NATO weapons standards. Until recently, the 
Lithuanian Republic (unlike Estonia, which has already switched 
to NATO standards, and Latvia, which has only made statements to 
that effect) has stated its commitment to weapons standards 
adopted in Russia upon buying a significant share of military 
property from the outgoing Russian Army. Now, however, Mr. 
Brazauskas said, as it signed the "Partnership for Peace" 
program, Lithuania would have to switch to weapons in service in 
NATO countries. Funds required for so costly an operation have 
evidently not yet been found, hence for the time being the 
government will use the money earmarked for culture, education, 
and health.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 2 [Feb] -- According to IBERIA news agency, 
the Council of Ministers of the autonomous republic of Abkhazia 
circulated a statement today in connection with the visit to 
Georgia by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The statement says that the visit of the Russian 
federation's 
president to Georgia is an historical event for both of the 
countries and may be considered the beginning of a positive 
turning point in Georgia for retaining its territorial integrity 
and unity. 
  The document says that the main issue in resolving the 
Abkhaz 
conflict is defining Abkhazia's political status. 
  The Council of Ministers of the autonomous republic of 
Abkhazia hopes that the Boris Yeltsin-Eduard Shevardnadze 
meeting and the signing of a package of documents will be useful 
not only for Georgia but also for Russia.

  [Text] Central Bank Governor Viktor Gerashchenko told 
Interfax in an exclusive interview that the budget parameters 
had not been defined yet for the first quarter of 1994. 
  He said that over the past three weeks the Finance Ministry 
had been trying hard to cut down spending and find new sources 
of income. The Central Bank's and Finance Ministry's common 
task is to make use of available resources and capital through 
economic levers. 
  Although the Central Bank's emission mechanism helps cover 
expenses, it has an inflationary effect and so will therefore be 
used as little as possible, said Gerashchenko. 
  Speaking about the government's pledge to repay the debt of 
4 
Tn rubles to the defense industry, agricultural complex, and 
state-run enterprises in the first quarter of 1994, Gerashchenko 
said that these payments must be made over a longer period. 
Right now the most essential payments should be made, he 
continued. The repayment of those debts which are not so urgent 
should be delayed to avoid an outburst of cash in the first 
quarter of 1994. 
  Gerashchenko described Acting Finance Minister Sergey 
Dubinin 
as someone who realistically approaches difficult problems.

Gerashchenko's complete interview.

"'Balkanization' of North Caucasus Is Not Beneficial to the 
Russian Federation, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry Hastens To 
Announce This on the Eve of Yeltsin's Visit to Georgia"] 
  [Text] Anticipating possible suspicions about the "true" 
aims of Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Georgia scheduled for 3 and 4 February (some see the warming of 
Georgian-Russian relations as a "military-political alliance;" 
others, a recurrence of Russia's imperial ambitions), on 31 
January Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev met with leaders of the North Caucasian republics, 
apparently disarming them immediately with an announcement about 
the existence of a certain Russian strategic line in the 
Caucasus. Its contours, the minister did not neglect to note, 
are formed "on the basis of carefully weighed balance of state 
and regional interests." In proposing to the dispassionate 
presidents a "state view" on the future of Russian-Georgian 
relations (as is known, at the Federation Council session on the 
same day they opposed the signing of a full-scale treaty with 
Georgia, including the definition of the status of Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia), the minister observed that Russia, as well as 
the integrated and economically prosperous Georgia, need 
certainty on matters of protecting their external borders and 
also on prospects for the disposition of Russian troops on the 
republic's territory. Assuring those present that the treaty 
between Russia and Georgia will become a stabilizing factor in 
the life of the region, Andrey Kozyrev pointed to its direct 
link with a political settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia 
where Russia still does not abandon "the difficult but noble" 
mission of peacemaker. Kozyrev stressed that it is wrong to see 
in Russia's peacemaking efforts in the Caucasus "the 
Zhirinovskiy factor," something being speculated on both within 
the country and abroad. 
  Russia's position on Abkhazia's political future, the 
foreign 
policy department head said, is unchanging: While supporting 
the thesis of Georgia's territorial integrity, the Russian 
leadership is ready to assist the elaboration of such a status 
for Abkhazia that would take into account the interests of its 
multi-ethnic population. In this light the legitimacy of the 
referendum in Abkhazia on the future political structure is, 
according to the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, directly 
related to the settlement of the refugee problem. Rejecting 
suggestions about the Russian leadership's sympathies toward 
Tbilisi, the minister made it clear that the sanctions used by 
Russia against the Abkhaz population had nonetheless been 
correctly understood and appreciated by the Sukhumi leaders. 
The latter are invited (for their own well-being) to 
"realistically sum up the situation, display flexibility, and 
work toward a compromise." 
  In the course of the president's visit Moscow also hopes for 
success in a South Ossetian settlement, where, it believes, the 
thesis about Georgia's territorial integrity must remain 
unchallenged. In addition to recommendations about inviting the 
South Ossetian leadership to participate in working out 
Georgia's new constitution, Tbilisi, as Kozyrev promises, will 
also be encouraged to deal with the issue of the Ossetian 
refugees, whose return to Georgia would be conducive to 
resolving the essentially Russian Ossetian-Ingush conflict. 
During the visit to Georgia, the minister assured, the question 
about the position of Russians in the republic -- pensioners, 
war veterans, and former Soviet Army servicemen -- is also bound 
to come up. And although the official position by the Georgian 
leadership with respect to the Russian- speaking minority does 
not arouse Moscow's concern, Moscow cannot but note that in the 
last two years 150,000 citizens have moved to Russia. 
  Concluding the meeting, Kozyrev stressed that the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry's Department on Liaison with the Federation 
Components, Parliament, and Public and Political Organizations 
seeks to expand cooperation between the Russian regions and the 
neighboring countries, while the leaders of the North Caucasus 
republics, who are expected to display understanding of the 
statewide importance of the upcoming visit to Georgia, are free 
to join this process. 
  As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent has learned, the 
reaction by the North Caucasus republics' leaders to Kozyrev's 
report has not been enthusiastic, to put it mildly. By general 
admission, one of the "guests" at the house on Smolenskaya 
Square confided, a treaty with Georgia is untimely. The 
unfavorable situation in Tbilisi, leaders of the Russian 
Federation components think, in contrast to the Russian foreign 
minister, is not yet cause for Russia's tutelage of Georgia. 
The opinion of the Federation Council, as articulated by Aslan 
Dzharimov and Akhsarbek Galazov, presidents of the Republic of 
Adygeya and North Ossetia; and Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of 
the State Duma's Committee on CIS Affairs, will apparently 
create certain difficulties in ratifying the draft treaty 
prepared for the visit.

almost reduced to a discussion about the place of the Federation 
Council in the political and power structure. Senators regarded 
the fact that the prime minister was busy as a political step 
aimed at diminishing the role of the upper chamber. It was the 
first time that claims were made to Vladimir Shumeyko, who, in 
the opinion of people's electors, did not ensure that the head 
of the government was present and thus, I quote, behaved 
dishonorably. 
  Work returned to normal when Economics Minister Aleksandr 
Shokhin appeared on the rostrum and gave a forecast on the 
social and economic development in 1994. Its main theses are: 
  -- to conduct a moderately tough financial policy, which 
would allow the inflation rate to drop to 20 percent -- in 
January it was higher due to the political situation. Figures 
of 7 to 9 percent are being expected by the end of this year; 
  -- to make the financial and tax policy tougher; 
  -- to ease restrictions on exports and to render support to 
the country's own manufacturers. 
  The economics minister agreed to the criticism that 
insufficient attention is being paid to the social policy. He 
assured those present that effective measures will be adopted in 
the near future. 
  This was not the last meeting with the government on 
Thursdays because, as a result of a name-vote held for the first 
time, a decision was adopted to wait for the prime minister's 
appearance, and to hear his report at any time. Thus, it was 
said that the government leadership should take note of the 
opinion of the upper chamber that will be giving recommendations 
regarding amendments to the economic policy.

<F P=106> [Observer Manki Ponomarev article: "In Search of a New </F>
Strategy"] 
  [Text] Last summer the U.S. Defense Department published 
an extensive report entitled "Cardinal Review of the Armed 
Forces' Structure." At the time analysts perceived it as a 
document setting forth the main provisions of a new U.S. 
military doctrine and military strategy. 
  In time, however, it became clear that this was not quite 
so. 
It turned out that the "new national program of military 
building," as the U.S. press called it, was certainly not a 
finished program but just a rough draft of one, although it had 
been worked out in depth. Two months after the Pentagon's 
report appeared, President Clinton ordered the formation of an 
interdepartmental group of experts with the task of preparing 
recommendations for a "fundamental reappraisal" of U.S. nuclear 
policy and strategy and the elaboration of new approaches to the 
building and utilization of the nuclear forces. Along with the 
elaborated data on a review of the general principles of 
military building and of the structure of the armed forces, the 
conclusions of this group of experts are to be approved by the 
President and set forth in his special "Policy Review 
Directive." This directive does not yet exist, although it has 
been given the number 34. 
  Other parameters of U.S. military strategy, of the structure 
of the armed forces, and of policy in the defense sphere are 
also being elaborated. Defense Secretary Les Aspin declared 
this when he recently addressed a conference of the Reserve 
Officers' Association. According to him, the purport of all 
this work is that the United States must be the only superpower 
remaining in the world after the Cold War. 
  The task of creating armed forces which, the Pentagon boss 
said, must be "capable of fighting and winning two large 
regional wars being waged simultaneously" is now advanced as the 
basis of Washington's military policy. This "two-win strategy" 
will demand greater "flexibility and maneuverability" both of 
regular units of the U.S. armed forces and of the reserve 
forces. At the same time a special role is allocated to reserve 
and National Guard units. They must be equipped, manned, and 
trained so as to be able at any moment to embark on fulfilling 
combat tasks equally with regular troops. 
  This is just one element of the ongoing review of U.S. 
military policy and strategy. Measures are being taken to 
further improve other components as well. The task has been set 
in such a way as to complete this work, in the main, by this 
spring. The U.S. Administration believes that the rapid changes 
in the international situation, the departure from the scene of 
old threats and the emergence of new ones demand the constant 
renewal both of the theoretical arsenal and of the practice of 
military building. 
  President Clinton, the defense secretary declared, "is sworn 
to ensure that America continues to have the best trained, best 
equipped, and most combat-efficient troops in the world." But 
this does demand extra money, which will be forthcoming. The 
White House has already reported that the Administration will 
request $263.7 billion for military purposes in the coming 
Fiscal 1995 -- $3 billion more than was allocated in the current 
year. 
  This is the only way, Washington believes, that the United 
States will be able to remain the No. 1 superpower.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In Support of Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] If Russia pursues a policy which forces us to 
return to the Cold War period, irreparable harm will be done to 
U.S. national security. This thought was expressed by Anthony 
Lake, assistant to the president for national security. In an 
interview on CNN's International Hour he pointed out that the 
administration keeps a close watch on the development of the 
political and economic situation in Russia and expresses its 
concern to a certain extent. "The transition to democracy and 
the market in Russia is a long and painful process," the 
high-ranking administration representative said. "Of course, we 
will celebrate the Russians' victories along with them and 
commiserate with their defeats. However, the most important 
thing is that the country's main development should not 
jeopardize U.S. interests." 
  "It should not be forgotten," Lake went on, "that Russia is 
now at the stage of developing the plan for the further 
development of the economy. Government Chairman Chernomyrdin 
has assured everyone that he remains committed to the process of 
reforms. We can only adopt a wait-and-see stance and follow 
their further progress. Let us also remember that despite a 
certain departure from the original course, the past year can be 
described as successful in Russia. Approximately three-fourths 
of small enterprises and one-fourth of medium and large 
enterprises in Russia have now been privatized. More than 90 
percent of goods are currently sold via the free market. We can 
see progress, and our task is to support it by every available 
means." 
  Lake voiced U.S. concern at the possibility of growing 
tension in Russian-Ukrainian relations following Yuriy Meshkov's 
victory in the presidential elections in the Crimea. "At the 
same time we are completely satisfied with the reaction to this 
event of the Ukrainian and Russian governments, which have 
adopted a well-considered stance in this situation," the White 
House representative observed. "We are also satisfied with the 
policy pursued by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk since his 
meeting with Bill Clinton." 
  Commenting on the statement by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader 
of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, that air strikes by 
NATO forces on Serbian positions in Bosnia and Herzegovina would 
be regarded as a declaration of war on Russia, Lake observed: 
"I think we should be glad that Zhirinovskiy does not speak for 
the Russian Government and has not been involved in shaping 
Russia's foreign policy. If that happened, we would now be 
arguing with Russia over the ownership of Alaska."

<F P=106> [Report by Aydyn Mekhtiyev under the "Azerbaijan" rubric: </F>
"Compromise Did Not Materialize. Vladimir Kazimirov Ends Baku 
Visit"] 
  [Text] Azerbaijani leaders have turned down Moscow's 
proposal for a cease-fire in the area of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict that would have gone into effect 
at 0000 on 1 February. This transpired on the afternoon of 31 
January after the completion of talks in Baku between 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and Vladimir Kazimirov, 
chief of the Russian Federation's mediatory mission, who had 
arrived in Azerbaijani capital. According to reports from 
Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry sources, the talks were held in a 
difficult atmosphere. Before noon the Russian diplomat 
discussed the Russian plan for a peaceful settlement with 
Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov one on one for more 
than two hours. The two sides considered the possibility of a 
cease-fire to go into force on the night of 1 February along the 
entire front line. 
  Vladimir Kazimirov, who earlier visited Yerevan and 
Khankendi 
(Stepanakert), managed to obtain the Armenian side's agreement 
to the cease-fire. He then had to convince the Baku authorities 
of the need to reciprocate. To all appearances, the meeting of 
the Russian diplomat with the Azerbaijani foreign minister was 
inconclusive. In a press release on the results of the meeting, 
Vladimir Kazimirov said that "the conflicting parties still hold 
uncompromising stances." Nonetheless he expressed his hope that 
a cease-fire agreement would finally be reached and would go 
into force on the night of 1 February. However, Kazimirov's 
meeting with the Azerbaijani president, which took place a bit 
later, confirmed that Baku was unprepared to compromise with the 
Armenian side. After the meeting with the Russian diplomat, 
Geydar Aliyev said that signing a cease-fire agreement would be 
possible only after Armenian troops left occupied Azerbaijani 
territories. According to Aliyev, currently Armenian troops 
occupy seven Azerbaijani districts outside Nagorno-Karabakh, and 
agreeing to negotiate with Armenia before the troop withdrawal 
would mean Azerbaijan's submission to Yerevan's pressure. 
  To all appearances, Azerbaijan's refusal to sign a 
cease-fire 
in the region without preconditions means that a meeting of the 
foreign ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow 
scheduled for this week will be postponed indefinitely. 
  An official spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry told 
your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that Moscow was not 
inclined to see the results of the Baku talks as a failure of 
the mediatory mission. In the near future Moscow will continue 
its peacekeeping efforts to broker a truce in the region. 
"Without a cease-fire none of the parties is likely to have its 
demands satisfied," the representative of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry said.

  [Text] In a letter to President Geydar Aliyev, Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said: 
  Mr. President, I have received your letter dated 28 November 
1993. Belgium is well aware of the destruction caused by the 
dispute in Daghlyk Karabakh and laments that state of affairs. 
In parallel with our president's tasks as the chairman of the 
European Union [EU] Committee, my country is making a diplomatic 
effort within the CSCE Minsk Group's framework to contribute 
toward the finding of a just solution to that dispute. Any 
decision for the solution of the problem must be in accordance 
with CSCE principles and provide for the maintenance of 
international borders and the protection of the rights of ethnic 
minorities. 
  Disturbed by the fate of hundreds of thousands of refugees, 
who are in serious condition, Belgium and its EU partners have 
recently decided to increase their humanitarian aid to that 
region. 
  Meanwhile, I am convinced that mutual cooperation between 
Belgium and Azerbaijan can be successfully improved. The 
Belgian Government is prepared to cooperate with you on that 
matter. 
  Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to convey my 
respects to you once again.

<F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov under the "Former Soviet Union" </F>
rubric: "Azerbaijan: Self-Imposed News Blackout"] 
  [Text] Baku -- The situation regarding Russian newspapers 
in Azerbaijan is blighting the lives of tens of thousands of 
subscribers. For the fourth month running they have not 
received LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, ARUMENTY I 
FAKTY, and PRAVDA -- these publications were printed in Baku 
until recently. The Azerbmetbuatyayymy Production Association 
makes no secret of who is to blame for this scandal: The 
Azerbaijan Printing House, which is failing to meet its 
contractual obligations, is the prime culprit. 
  It has its own excuses: The Moscow publishing houses do not 
always settle their debts on time and the Moscow plants 
producing printing plates are not delivering their goods. There 
are also problems concerning newsprint. 
  At the same time, the republic's National Bank has not yet 
transferred to the publishing houses of Russia and other CIS 
countries 120 million rubles' worth of subscription fees paid by 
Azerbaijanis for foreign newspapers and magazines in 1994. The 
delivery of Russian newspapers in Azerbaijan is therefore 
altogether problematic. 
  Against the background of all this, the statement by the 
official authorities that the republic is experiencing a news 
blackout is bizarre, to say the least. You get the impression 
that all the obstacles to the distribution of Russian newspapers 
in Azerbaijan are artificially created. 
  The most surprising thing is the lack of realism shown by 
the 
Moscow editorial offices. On top of their disappointed 
expectations, subscribers are also suffering financial losses, 
as nobody is minded to return them their subscription fees. In 
similar situations the Moscow publishing houses have arranged 
for their publications to be delivered by post. Readers may 
have received them late, but they have received them. And what 
is going to happen to the delivery of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the number of subscribers to which has shot 
up in Azerbaijan? 
  Here, in addition to applying penalties for breach of 
contract, the Russian newspaper publishing houses could adopt a 
different means of financing the printing and distribution of 
publications in the republic.

public by its chairman Konstantin Zatulin at a news conference

  The document notes: There are no grounds to trust the 
capability of the Georgian side to guarantee that the weapons 
will be handled carefully or that the treaty's stipulation on 
not transferring them to third parties will be strictly 
fulfilled.

  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- A tiny group in the 
Russian State Duma, which had split from the pro-Yeltsin 
Russia's Choice bloc, opposed the statement of leaders of all 
factions who warned the Russian president they may not ratify 
the Russian-Georgian treaty which he signed on Thursday. 
  The "Union of December 12" group, which was not even been 
registered because of tiny membership, issued a statement on 
Friday welcoming the treaty and characterising it as "a timely 
and politically justified action capable of averting several 
negative tendencies, including the search by Georgia for new 
allies among its neighbours which can result in the loss of 
Russian influence in the region". 
  The faction criticised other lawmakers for their attitude to 
the treaty. 
  On Wendesday leaders of all factions of the State Duma, 
including Yegor Gaydar, expressed concern over the military 
aspect of the Russian-Georgian treaty and warned they may not 
ratify it. 
  "The provisions of the treaty envisaging, in particular, a 
further agreement on assisting Georgia in creating its armed 
forces, in arming them and providing for them weapons, military 
equipment and technologies can, as we believe, detsabilise the 
situation in the Caucasus and become a barrier for the 
ratification of the treaty by the State Duma", they said in a 
letter to the president signed by speaker Ivan Rybkin. 
  Yeltsin, in his turn, said that the treaty will not be 
submitted for parliament ratification until Georgia settles the 
conflicts in its two self-styled regions of South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia.

  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev has welcomed Russian-Georgian agreements on 
military cooperation signed during President Boris Yeltsin's 
visit to Georgia on Thursday [3 February]. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS, Grachev described 
as one of the main results of the visit the signing of a 
protocol of intent to set up Russian military bases in Georgia. 
Under the protocol, Russia will establish three military bases 
in this Caucasian republic -- in Vazeani, Akhalkalaki and Batumi 
-- by July 1, 1994. They will be staffed mostly with land and 
Air Force troops. 
  Aleksandr Galkin, head of the Russian delegation to the 
talks 
with Georgia, said that Georgia wants Russian troops to stay in 
the republic after 1995 when an agreement on their presence in 
Georgia expires. 
  Galkin said that Russian military presence in Georgia is 
indispensable for ensuring stabilisation of the situation, 
protecting the rights of the Russian-speaking population and 
providing assistance to Georgia to establish its own armed 
forces. 
  The agreement on Russian military bases in Georgia has been 
signed for ten years. After that it can be prolonged by mutual 
consent. The number of troops and weapons at the bases will be 
specified by a special working group later. However, Grachev 
believes that Russia should keep up to 23,000 troops in the 
Transcaucasia, including two thirds of them in Georgia. 
  The sides also agreed that Russia will train military 
specialists for Georgia. According to Galkin, georgia will need 
at least five years to establish its own armed forces.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin's 
almost lightning-fast visit to the Georgian Republic has yielded 
mutually advantageous and long-ranging solutions to political, 
economic and other problems in relations between Russia and 
Georgia. The many-days-long efforts of politicians and diplomats 
from the two countries were rounded off by the signing of the 
Russo-Georgian Treaty of Friendship, Good-Neighbourly Relations 
and Cooperation. They had to display much persistence in their 
effort to restore the traditional ties of friendship between the 
two countries in spite of the destructive upheavals of past 
years and contrary to the speculations of enemies of the treaty. 
  The leaders and foreign ministries of the two countries have 
exerted titanic efforts in this direction over the past few 
weeks. Assessing the results of their work, Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev stressed during a recent meeting with leaders of 
the North Caucasian republics that it was neither in the 
interests of Russia, nor of each nation of the North Caucasian 
region to have next to them a state torn asunder by internal 
strife, plunged into an economic chaos and crime. In his 
opinion, the treaty is a key to stability in the entire southern 
region of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This is 
perhaps the briefest answer to the question: What will the 
treaty give Russia and the Caucasian peoples? 
  "The treaty is primarily important politically for Russia," 
ITAR-TASS was told by member of the Russian Presidential Council 
Emil Pain, "because it is wrong to adhere to two criteria at a 
time in politics: If you are an advocate of Russia's integrity, 
you must be also an advocate of the integrity of neighbouring 
states". Moreover, the current summit talks have shown that the 
treaty gives Russia several purely pragmatic advantages: Access 
to ports, establishment of military bases, maintenance of a 
military-strategic status quo, which is of common importance for 
all the CIS nations. 
  Along with the treaty, which lays a solid legal foundation 
for the entire complex of relations between the two states, 
Russia and Georgia have also signed more than twenty other 
documents. They have also exchanged views on problems linked 
with bilateral cooperation, settlement of conflicts in Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia, on key international problems and on the 
situation in the transcaucasian region as a whole. 
  "The Russian side," President Yeltsin stressed, "stands for 
a 
cardinal improvement of relations with Georgia in all spheres, 
for the quickest possible restoration of ruptured economic, 
cultural, and spiritual contacts, for rapprochement and 
integration. Russia proceeds from the need to honour Georgia's 
territorial integrity and to guarantee fully the interests of 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia." 
  "The documents signed in Tbilisi and the results of the 
summit talks will contribute to the strengthening of cooperation 
not only between our two countries, but among all the nations of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States, too," Eduard 
Shevardnadze, head of the Georgian state, told a press 
conference in Tbilisi. "The importance of President Yeltsin's 
visit transcends the limits of Georgian-Russian relations. 
Their normalisation is closely linked with the settlement of 
all the outstanding problems in the Caucasian and Black Sea 
region, with the achievement of peace and stability there." 
  Asked whether the negotiations touched on Georgia's 
inclusion 
in the rouble zone, President Yeltsin told the press conference 
that it was decided to set up working teams to examine all the 
"pros" and "cons" concerning both Georgia and Russia. 
Journalists put another "difficult question" to Yeltsin: What 
do you think about the State Duma's attitude to the signed 
treaty? The president did not rule out discussions, because 
"any international treaty is subject to debate". "Nevertheless," 
he said, "I am sure that members of the State Duma will 
positively approach this full-scale treaty with the independent 
Republic of Georgia".

  [Text] Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian delegation at 
the Estonian-Russian talks, the latest round of which ended 
today, said that Russia intends to link the issue of Russian 
military pensioners rigidly with the troop withdrawal. 
According to Svirin, Estonia demands that the majority of the 
servicemen who retired after 20 August 1991 should leave when 
the army leaves, even if they have no accommodation in Russia. 
The remaining military pensioners must apply to Estonian 
authorities for residence permits. At the same time they are 
required to give a signed declaration saying that they have no 
arms at home and do not intend to obtain any. Retired 
servicemen must also promise not to join any military formations 
nor endanger the state of Estonia through their actions. 
  Svirin stated that such requirements are humiliating. 
  According to Svirin, the Russian side expected to reach an 
agreement on the citizenship issue, but the Estonian delegation 
refused discussion on the matter.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Zhdannikov report under the "Russia-Estonia" </F>
rubric: "Talks Coincide With Tartu Agreement Anniversary. 
Russian Side Prefers To Forget About It"] 
  [Text] The winding up of the 16th round of 
Russian-Estonian talks coincided with another anniversary of the 
1920 Tartu Peace Treaty. Ambassador Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary Vasiliy Svirin, who leads the Russian delegation 
to talks with Estonia, remarked that the sides completely forgot 
the date in the course of the tense two-week work: "As far as 
we are concerned, that treaty has died a natural death." 
  The Russian diplomat advised that the work on 1 and 2 
February centered on the four [as published] main problems of 
bilateral relations: the withdrawal of Russian troops from the 
territory of Estonia, social protection for Russian military 
pensioners who live in the Baltic republic, and border and 
economic questions. The Russian side had planned to turn over 
to its Estonian counterparts a complete schedule for the 
withdrawal of troops until 31 August 1994, but seeing that the 
Estonians had completely blocked the question of military 
pensioners' rights, it did not find it possible to make such a 
step. Mr. Svirin confirmed the statement by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin to the effect that Russia had never 
linked the problem of its troop withdrawal from Baltic territory 
with the position of the Russian-speaking civilian population. 
He remarked, however, that the problems of upholding the rights 
of servicemen and retired servicemen had always been regarded as 
part of the troop withdrawal questions. "The conduct of the 
Estonian Government may entail considerable repercussions 
because it actually deals with the deportation of military 
pensioners," he said. For example, leaders of this Baltic 
country demand that all military men retired after 20 August 
1991 should leave the republic's territory before 31 August 
1994. The remaining 9,000 pensioners (35,000 together with 
their families) are only granted the right to seek residence 
permits while the Estonian side advanced such humiliating, 
according to the Russian diplomat, requirements as 
nonparticipation in armed formations and not having been 
implicated in cooperation with foreign intelligence services. 
The package of border questions, Vasiliy Svirin declared, had 
been also blocked by the Estonian side. 
  The Russian delegation once again underlined, during the 
latest round of talks, that Estonian claims to a number of 
rayons in Pskov Oblast were hopeless. Vasiliy Svirin remarked 
that Estonia is still refusing to demarcate the land borders: 
"Russia will probably have to do this unilaterally," he warned.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 02, BNS -- The refusal of the Russian 
negotiators to present a timetable for the withdrawal of troops 
Estonian at the intergovernmental talks on Wednesday [2 
Wednesday] was named as "surprising" by the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  In its comments on the results of the negotiations released 
late Wednesday, the ministry notes, that the surprise comes 
since a timetable "has been repeatedly promised by Russian 
spokesmen and was even mentioned in Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's recent letter to Estonian President Lennart Meri". 
  "Since Estonia has fundamentally accepted the August 31, 
1994 
final date offered by the Russians, the logical and necessary 
next step was for Russia to produce a detailed timetable," - 
Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik was quoted by the ministry 
as saying. Luik is now in Brussels, where he is to sign the 
Partnership for Peace agreement Thursday. 
  "Estonia still expects Russia to live up to the 
international 
obligations it accepted by signing the Final Document of the 
Helsinki Summit in July 1992, requiring the early, orderly and 
complete withdrawal of foreign military forces from the 
territories of the Baltic states," -- the ministry notes, -- 
"Although there can no longer be talk of an `early' withdrawal, 
the pullout can still be completed completely, unconditionally 
and in an orderly fashion."

  [Text] The next round of Russian-Estonian talks will take 
place in Tallinn on 1-2 March, Svirin, head of the Russian 
delegation, reported. Correspondent M. Sarbaa reports: 
  Military pensioners in Estonia are a stumbling block at the 
Russian-Estonian talks it was stated today at a news conference 
held at the Estonian Republic Embassy in Moscow on the outcome 
of the 16th round of Russian-Estonian talks which ended 
yesterday. Estonian Ambassador Juriy Kahn said that the Russian 
side had promised to provide a schedule of its troop withdrawal 
from Estonian by this round. The problem of military pensioners 
could delay the final withdrawal of troops set for 31 August of 
this year. 
  In point of fact, Estonia is demanding the deportation from 
the country of approximately 35,000 people, including family 
members of pensioners, to which, of course, Russia will never 
agree. Because of this, the issues of border demarcation, 
Estonia's debt and economic and trade cooperation remain 
unresolved. 
  Work at the talks was carried out by six groups which 
discussed a wide range of problems between Estonia and Russia.

  [Text] The Estonian Foreign Ministry expressed concern that 
during the Russian-Estonian talks in Moscow Russia did not 
present any schedule for its troops' withdrawal from Estonia. 
  It circulated a statement saying that "as the two parties 
have agreed upon the date of the complete withdrawal in 
principle (August 31, 1994), Estonia hopes that Russia would 
take urgent steps to implement this agreement. 
  During a press conference summing up the results of the 
talks, head of the Russian delegation Vassily Svirin stated that 
Russia had drafted a schedule, but did not pass it to Estonia 
"because Estonia's irreconcilable position hampered the 
coordination of documents on the protection of the retired 
Russian servicemen and their families living in Estonia. 
  The statement also says that the Estonian government 
"demonstrated good will and approved the decree defining the 
procedure for obtaining residence permits by retired foreign 
servicemen and their families." 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry emphasized that the government 
was motivated by a humane attitude to the individuals who find 
it difficult to return to their homeland because Russia did not 
create proper conditions for this, despite its moral and 
juridical obligations. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry qualified the actions of its 
government as a "brave step," because "the Russian troops are 
still located in Estonia, while their strength, including the 
number of retired servicemen, far exceeds the strength of the 
Estonian defence forces." 
  As many as 2,500 Russian servicemen still stay in Estonia. 
The Estonian Defense Forces have about the same number of 
personnel, plus about 2,000 border guards. Estonia's voluntary 
defense organization "Kaitseliit" has about 6,000 men. 
  There are about 11,000 retired Russian servicemen living in 
Estonia.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Tallinn understnds the difficulties Russia is 
experiencing in connection with its troops withdrawal from 
Estonia. That is why it agrees to the time for withdrawal fixed 
by the Russian side (before August 31st, 1994: Interfax note), 
and does not insist on an earlier date, Estonia's Ambassador to 
Russia, Yuriy Kahn, told a news conference given on Thursday 
after the latest round of bilateral talks. 
  The Estonian side, he said, has only one wish: that Russia 
step up the withdrawal of units stationed in the center of 
Tallinn which are in direct proximity to the building of 
Estonia's parliament. 
  The diplomat expressed surprise at the Russian delegation's 
refusal to present a schedule for troops withdrawal on the 
grounds that the problem of Russian military retirees in Estonia 
remains unresolved. According to him, earlier the two sides 
agreed "to resort to no linkages, and discuss every issue 
separately." 
  "This road leads to a deadlock. Linkages can only turn the 
negotiating process into bargaining," he said. 
  According to the ambassador, those in the Russian military 
who retired after the time when Estonia gained its independence 
(August 20th, 1991: Interfax's note) must leave Estonia 
together with the withdrawing troops. 
  "It's odd that Russia has not granted these people any legal 
or social guarantees. It seems to have decided to leave them in 
Estonia's care. These people fought for Russia, and such an 
attitude to them on the part of Moscow is inadmissible," he said. 
  With reference to the package of "border issues" Kahn noted 
that Russia "seems to have begun to understand that the 
administrative line fixed by Stalin cannot serve as a state 
border between the two countries." 
  "When determining our border we continue to be guided by the 
peace treaty signed with Russia in Tartu (in 1920: Interfax 
note), and we believe that Moscow has territorial claims to us, 
not vice versa," Kahn said. 
  According to the ambassador, a meeting should be organized 
between the Russian and Estonian presidents "so as to reach 
serious solutions." 
  "Unfortunately, Russia's Foreign Ministry believes that all 
issues should be tentatively coordinated between lower-level 
officials, after which the presidents will only sign the 
documents already drafted. We do not share this approach," the 
diplomat said.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 03, BNS -- The delegations of Estonia 
and Russia at the 16th round of intergovernmental talks almost 
completely approved the draft agreement on the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Estonia. 
  Estonia at the latest round of talks for the first time 
formally accepted Russia's proposal to pull its troops from the 
country by Aug. 31, said the Estonian Ambassador to Russia, Juri 
Kahn. 
  He said the only issue on which the parties had failed to 
reach a final agreement was that of paying compensation. The 
topic has to be settled at the level of heads of state. 
  Russia has said it would agree to call a summit meeting of 
the two countries' leaders only after Estonia provides social 
welfare guarantees for the retired Russian military under the 
conditions set by Russia. 
  Kahn quoted Russian officials as saying their side would not 
present a detailed timetable for the withdrawal of units from 
Estonia until the two countries have agreed on the issue of 
social welfare guarantees for the military who retired after 
Aug. 20, 1991. 
  The ambassador said this latest stance was causing 
bewilderment to Estonia, as the countries earlier had agreed to 
solve any problems one at a time without linking them to one 
another. 
  Kahn dismissed Russia's allegations of Estonia's 
unwillingness to resolve the border issue as groundless. 
"Russia's wish to establish the border along the line where its 
border guards now stand is unacceptable for Estonia," he said. 
He added that Estonia on many occasions had sought taking 
international law as basis for discussion of the border issue. 
  The next round of Estonian-Russian talks is to be held at 
the 
beginning of March. It is possible that Estonian Foreign 
Minister Juri Luik will meet Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitali Churkin in the meantime, Kahn added.

<F P=106> ["ETA News Release"] </F>
  [Text] Tallinn, February 3 -- No agreements were concluded 
in the 16th round of Estonian-Russian inter-state negotiations 
on February 1 and 2 in Moscow, Ago Tiiman, secretary of the 
Estonian delegation and head of the military working group told 
a news conference on Thursday [3 February], while Rein Helme, 
head of the parliament's defence committee claims Russia intends 
to drag on the negotiations deliberately. 
  Tiiman said that the round discussed traditional issues of 
military, economic, border and humanitarian spheres. The 
military group dealt as usually with agreements on Russian troop 
withdrawal, retired military social security measures and 
dismantling of nuclear training base at Paldiski. 
  Tiiman said that the agreement of withdrawal of forces was 
principally ready, only bilateral compensations demands had to 
be still decided upon. All other articles of the agreement were 
coordinated, including the troop pullout deadline of August 31, 
1994, which should not be touched upon any more. 
  As it was announced yesterday Russia did not present a 
detailed timetable of withdrawal of its forces from Estonia, as 
it had repeatedly promised. The fact that the Russian 
delegation failed to present the timetable proved that "our 
eastern neighbour searched pretext to drag on the negotiations," 
head of Riigikogu [parliament] state defence committee Rein 
Helme told ETA on Thursday. Vassili Svirin, the chief Russian 
negotiator said Russia did not present the timetable because of 
Estonia's rejection of a Moscow proposal on retired military 
social guarantees. Helme said that the argument was a "searched 
pretext", showing that Russia used its responsibilities before 
its citizens to "shake Estonian political stability" and Russia 
was not interested in successful finishing of the negotiations. 
  Tiiman said that the agreement on military pensioners social 
securities was in a difficult situation although all questions 
that did not demand changes in the other side's laws were 
solved. Russia pays (military) retirement fees to 10,570 
persons residing in Estonia, 850 of whom are reserve officers, 
Tiiman said, adding that he doubted Vassili Svirin's words that 
former military personnel officers who are 55 or 60 years old at 
present were no danger to Estonian security. 
  Tiiman said that the last round of negotiations was, 
however, 
not to be regarded as an entire failure. Work has been most 
constructive on the issue of liquidation of the Paldiski nuclear 
training base. The head of the Paldiski working group Mark 
Sinisoo told a press conference, on Thursday, that the Russian 
side had given its final consent to international experts 
participation at the dismantling of the nuclear reactors, 
stating, however, that no international or Estonian experts 
could be present at the dismantling before the "secret 
components" were taken out of Estonia. Russian delegation also 
said that by September 1 the whole infrastructure of Paldiski, 
still a Russian military town, will be handed over to Estonia. 
  Tiiman said that the greatest number of agreements were 
prepared in the economic working group, but Russia was not 
interested in concluding them, e.g. the investments' protection 
agreement was ready already in June 1993, but Russia "simply 
does not want to conclude it", the same being true about the 
question of dividing former USSR property. Tiiman said that all 
this pointed to an old Russian Supreme Soviet decision according 
to which Russia will not regulate economic questions with 
Estonia before all other demands i.e. concerning the retired 
military and humanitarian issues, were not fulfilled.

  [Text] Russian and Kazakh negotiators ended the first round 
of their talks on drafting an agreement on the status of 
Baykonur and long term lease of the space launching station to 
Russia. 
  A senior official of the Russian Space Agency who had taken 
part in the talks told Interfax that "the two sides agreed to 
use the draft compiled by Russian experts as the basis for 
further negotiations." 
  A protocol was signed, listing the issues on which full 
agreement had been reached and those on which talks had to 
continue. In particular, no agreement has been reached on which 
country's legislation should apply in the station and which 
country's law enforcement agencies will police there and the 
town of Leninsk. 
  The official emphasized that the Kazakh negotiators needed 
more time to analyze the Russian offer of an amount to be paid 
for use of the launching pads. 
  He did not rule out the possibility that the talks would be 
continued in Almaty, the Kazakh capital. 
  Meanwhile, officials in the Kazakh embassy told Interfax 
that 
the status of Baykonur was likely to be discussed when the 
presidents of the two countries met in Moscow on February 11 and 
12. Nursultan Nazarbayev will have a stopover in Moscow on his 
way to the U.S.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 3 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- Experts from Russia 
and Kazakhstan completed their consultations on the status and 
use of the Baykonur space launch site today with virtually no 
result. They merely adopted a protocol on the meeting, which 
stated a mutual wish of the two sides to hold another meeting in 
mid-February. 
  The Kazakh side did not submit any documents to be discussed 
during the consultations but focussed on criticizing the 
projects drawn up by the Russian delegation. According to some 
experts, this is the reason why the two sides failed to arrive 
at a compromise solution concerning Baykonur's future. [passage

  [Text] Yerevan, 3 Feb -- "Our location on the territory of 
Armenia has nothing to do with events in Nagorno-Karabakh," the 
commander of the group of Russian forces told an ARMENPRESS-TASS 
correspondent in Yerevan today. "We are carrying out tasks 
stipulated by the interstate treaty of the Russian Federation. 
Any rumors and speculation about additional supplies of weapons 
being sent from Russia to Armenia are unfounded, whatever source 
they may be coming from."

  [Text] Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin has 
said that the package of documents on the unification of the 
monetary systems of Russia and Belarus is not yet prepared, and 
that is why the unification agreement cannot be signed during 
Viktor Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to Minsk. 
  The minister said he had learned of the premier's visit from 
the mass media and that he had never given his consent to 
signing the agreement. Shokhin recalled the fact that it was 
the prime minister who asked him to take up preparing the 
negotiations on the unification of the two countries' monetary 
systems. 
  Shokhin said the package of documents defining the procedure 
for the unification had not yet been prepared. He added that he 
had a meeting with one of Belarus' deputy prime ministers in 
Moscow last Friday. "We did not advertise this, but we detected 
a number of approaches to solving disputable issues. Now the 
task is to introduce the approaches into the text of an 
agreement," Shokhin was quoted as saying. With this aim in 
view, several Russian representatives left for Minsk for two to 
three days. "If the documents are to be, we must approve them at 
a government meeting," the minister pointed out. Only after 
this can the documents be signed, he added.

<F P=106> ["S. Etr." report: "Serbian Secret Weapon, According to </F>
Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Text] The "secret weapon" given to the Bosnian Serbs is 
apparently called Elipton and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the Russian 
extreme nationalist leader, on a visit to the former Yugoslavia 
until yesterday, states that it is not a joke: "Russian 
counterespionage officers used it on Wednesday against a Muslim 
military unit, killing 12 enemy soldiers. Their bodies bore no 
trace of firearm injury and the neighboring buildings were not 
damaged." 
  The Elipton apparently kills by some kind of ultrasound. The 
story may seem crazy and some close aides of Zhirinovskiy are 
playing down these remarks. But the latter insists and 
denounces skeptics and "all those who are afraid of the strength 
of his party and the new Russia." A section of the Serb press 
goes further, citing academicians with very grand-sounding 
titles who maintain that the principle behind this revolutionary 
weapon, capable of reversing the balance of forces with the 
West, is based on the work of Eugene Mathieu, a French 
mathematician of the last century.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 Feb -- This morning Andrey Kokoshin, first 
deputy defense minister of Russia, had a meeting with French 
Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who arrived in Moscow on an 
official visit on Wednesday. At the meeting Kokoshin said that 
"the Russian state leadership places great importance on the 
development of relations with France, including the military 
sphere. Our relations are being developed extremely carefully, 
incorporating both new realities and rich military traditions." 
  For his part, the French guest said that he was ready "to 
debate any security problems or crisis experienced by Russia." 
This is Francois Leotard's first official visit to Russia since 
his appointment to the post of the defense minister of France in 
spring 1993. 
  Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the general 
staff of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces, took part in the 
meeting, at which it was noted that close ties have recently 
formed between the two military departments. Army General Pavel 
Grachev, who visited France in January last year, signed an 
agreement on mutual contacts and, in particular, on exchanging 
military delegations, training Russian servicemen in France, and 
French servicemen in Russia. First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who visited Paris 
last autumn and whom Francois Leotard is planning to meet in 
Moscow, signed then the Russian- French agreement on cooperation 
in dismantling Russian nuclear weapons and ensuring reliability 
and safety during their transportation. 
  Francois Leotard will visit the Moscow army high command 
school today, meet Pavel Grachev on Friday, and visit the Tula 
airborne division. A Russian-French intergovernmental agreement 
on military cooperation is expected to be signed on Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Former Russian presidential 
aide Gennadiy Burbulis on Thursday [3 February] conditioned 
cooperation with and support for Russia's new cabinet on its 
pursuit of political and economic reforms. 
  Burbulis, a member of the Russian State Duma, and head of 
the 
humanitarian and political center "Strategia," made the remark 
in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  He also said reformists must pursue a "more realistic" 
course 
of reforms and acknowledge mistakes that have been made over the 
past two years resulting in bankruptcies and unemployment. 
  More emphasis must be placed on securing the livelihood of 
pensioners and other disadvantaged citizens, he said. 
  In an apparent barb at the new cabinet of Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Burbulis warned that the country's problems 
cannot be solved by such measures as excessive issuance of 
currency, which would fuel inflation, and reckless issuance of 
subsidies for state farms and industry. 
  He was speaking amid widespread speculation that market 
reforms are threatened by last month's cabinet shakeup and the 
departure of leading free marketeers Yegor Gaydar and Boris 
Fedorov, and Liberal Social Welfare Minister Ella Pamfilova. 
  Chernomyrdin has argued that the reshuffle was necessitated 
by the strong showing of ultranationalists and Communists in 
December's parliamentary elections. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has vowed that reforms will 
continue but has largely distanced himself from the new cabinet. 
  Burbulis, who is a leader of Russia's Choice, the largest 
party in the lower house of the legislature, is visiting Tokyo 
as a member of the Russian delegation to a two-day trilateral 
forum between Russia, Japan and the United States on problems of 
security in the north Pacific, which ended Wednesday.

  [Text] Tokyo February 3 TASS -- Takako Doi, chairwoman of 
the lower chamber of the Japanese Parliament, met Gennadiy 
Burbulis, deputy of Russia's State Duma, on Thursday [2 
February]. The meeting is considered to be the first step 
toward establishing interparliamentary ties between the two 
countries. 
  Burbulis together with his American and Japanese 
counterparts 
participated in the trilateral forum on security in the north- 
Pacific region which closed here on Wednesday. 
  Burbulis emphasized the significance of his meeting with 
Takako Doi "from the point of view of a revival of the Russian 
Parliament's prestige and the authority of the Russian 
parliamentarians" in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday. 
  According to him, Takako doi showed much interest in the 
process of forming the new Russian Parliament and emphasized 
that it was important to establish fruitful cooperation between 
the Russian and Japanese lawmakers as soon as possible. 
  She called on the Russian Parliament to resume the 
activities 
of the Russo-Japanese parliamentary committee which was 
suspended because of the dissolvement of the former Supreme 
Soviet. 
  Takako Doi expressed grave concern about the fact that the 
last transformations inside Russia's Government might result in 
curtailing the economic reforms. In response, Burbulis, who 
represents the "Russia's Choice" faction in the lower chamber of 
Russia's Parliament, said that the new Russian Constitution, 
which was adopted on December 12, 1993, had for the first time 
given the chance to secure political stability in the country. 
  "In no case shall we leave President Boris Yeltsin in 
isolation, without the indispensable support of the 
professionals who carried out the economic reforms," he 
emphasized. 
  In his opinion, joint work of President yeltsin and Premier 
Viktor chernomyrdin Is a sure guaranty of stability inside 
Russia. 
  "Boris Yeltsin has received enough powers to provide for a 
stable and competent system of government. As for Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, he has always demonstrated his ability to make 
strategic decisions which were in line with the course of 
economic reforms," he said. 
  "Today it should have been dangerous to let the union 
between 
the president and the chairman of goverment collapse," he 
emphasized.

  [Text] The Navy is willing to give the coast guards the 
necessary assistance in protecting the South Kuril sector of 
Russia's border, a high-ranking naval official told Interfax. 
  Russian coast guards, he said, are considering several ways 
to strengthen the border in the area of the South Kuril Islands. 
"The Navy will support any of them and grant the necessary aid: 
speed boats, fuel and the like," he said. 
  As Interfax learned from the press bureau of Russia's 
frontier troops, no gross violations of Russia's sea border in 
the South Kuril direction have been registered since the end of 
January. "Several Japanese fishing vessels were noticed in the 
vicinity of Russia's territorial waters during the period in 
question, but they launched no illegal actions," said a member 
of the press bureau. 
  According to him, massive border violations in the South 
Kuril direction were noted between the 21st and the 24th of 
January, when Japanese fishing ships committed about one hundred 
violations of Russia's sea border. 
  "The coast guards, their patrol ships and helicopters are 
ready to prevent any violations of Russia's border," Interfax's 
interviewee pointed out. 
  Russia's position remains unchanged: we recognize the 
existence of a territorial dispute in our relations with Japan 
and are willing to discuss it, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official dealing with the "Japanese problems" told Interfax. 
  As he said, the territorial dispute will be discussed in 
Moscow on February 21st, when the Russian-Japanese group working 
on a peace treaty convenes for a session. The exchange of views 
will be continued on February 22nd, when bilateral working 
consultations presided over by Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, 
Aleksandr Panov, and his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshi Fukuda, 
take place in Moscow. 
  According to the diplomat, the Russian side intends to 
discuss in detail the problem connected with the increasingly 
frequent violations of Russia's frontier by Japanese fishing 
vessels in the area of the four disputed South Kuril islands.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Tokyo, 3 Feb -- Colonel General Andrey 
Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian border troops, who 
is at present in Tokyo, today showed Russian journalists a video 
recorded by Russian border troops. It clearly shows about 10 
Japanese fishing vessels out of a total of 130 fishing vessels 
which violated the Russian state border on 21 January this year. 
[passage omitted] 
  The video made by the Russian border troops left no doubts 
about the authenticity of the fact that the Japanese fishermen 
violated the Russian Federation state border. The video, made 
with the help of special equipment from a border troops' 
helicopter, clearly shows the registeration numbers and names of 
the vessels, in particular vessels with the numbers 
"H-K-2-20234" and "H-K-2-19082," and the schooners "Kosio-maru," 
"Tayio-maru," and "Nogisinko-maru." The video clearly shows the 
crews of two vessels covering the numbers of their schooners 
with improvised means in order to prevent the Russian border 
troops from recording the numbers. 
  Andrey Nikolayev pointed out in an interview with the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent that he is ready to hand over the video 
to the Japanese officials, including the leadership of the 
Directorate for Security at Sea, if he receives such a request. 
"If there is no such request then we will hand over the video 
to Russian Television on arrival in Moscow," he said. 
  It has become known to the ITAR-TASS correspondent that 
during the first, in Russian-Japanese relations, talks held 
today between the commander in chief of the Russian border 
troops and representatives of the Directorate for Security at 
Sea, the Japanese side was informed that the Russian border 
troops have a video which proves the violation of the Russian 
Federation border on 21 January by Japanese fishing vessels. 
Yet the Japanese border troops failed to ask for the video. 
  It remains completely unknown what other issues were 
discussed at Andrey Nikolayev's meeting with his Japanese 
colleagues. Informed sources have told the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that the Japanese side insisted that there should 
be total confidentiality at the talks and that their contents 
should not be made public. According to sources, this is 
connected with the fact that Japan's attitude toward direct 
contacts with Russian border troops -- a country with which 
Japan still does not have a peace treaty, and that means no 
state border -- remains sufficiently painfully sensitive.

  [Text] Tokyo February 3 TASS -- Russian border troops "will 
use in full measure the rights granted to then by Russian 
legislation" to suppress any violations of the border of the 
Russian Federation in the Far East, the Commander in Chief of 
the Russian Border Troops Andrey Nikolayev said in Tokyo today. 
  Nikolayev added that this also meant the use of firearms 
against transgressors if they failed to obey orders by border 
guards. 
  As concerns the mass violation of the Russian border near 
the 
southern Kuril Islands by Japanese shipping vessels on January 
21 and 22, Nikolayev said that the transgression of the Russian 
border by 130 Japanese boats must have been preplanned. To all 
appearances, it was a reaction to the detention of a Japanese 
schooner under Captain Keinichi Noto by Russian coast guards in 
the same area at the end of November. Firearms were used after 
the Japanese captain declined to obey orders. He was wounded. 
  Nikolayev said Keinichi Noto will soon face trial by a 
Russian court which will decide on the fate of the captain and 
his schooner. 
  Soon after Captain Noto's schooner was detained, the 
Japanese 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded in a note to Moscow that 
the captain and two sailors, as well as the boat, be released. 
The two sailors returned to Japan in January. 
  Nikolayev stressed that the Russian border units in the Far 
East "will protect the state border in accordance with the 
principles defined by the Russian president and government". 
  "No one should have any doubts that we will firmly guard our 
country's economic interests," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin today sent greetings to the participants of the joint 
Russian-American space flight on the American space shuttle 
Discovery. 
  In his address circulated by the presidential press service, 
Boris Yeltsin says, among other things, that this space flight 
is not a routine event. For the first time a Russian national, 
Sergey Krikalev, joins an American space crew. 
  The Russian president says that the Russian space station 
Mir 
is soon to host an American astronaut. He says: "This is a 
prominent example of cooperation and partnership, which is being 
established and strengthened between our two countries and 
peoples. The relations between Russia and America are becoming 
increasingly based on trust. We are beginning to realize ever 
more clearly that we must unite our efforts in order to resolve 
complicated issues, both on the Earth and in space, for the 
benefit of our peoples and in the interest of all mankind." 
  The Russian president hopes the participants in the joint 
Russian-American space flight will complete their work 
successfully and return safely to their home planet.

  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Possibilities of resolving 
the nuclear problem in North Korea have not exhausted and, 
therefore, it is necessary to continue discussing all questions 
at the negotiation table, Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a briefing held on Thursday [3 
February]. 
  Touching on the Russian side's participation in finding a 
solution to the nuclear problem in North Korea, Demurin said 
that Russia is working in three directions. It supports a 
dialogue between North Korea and the United States, North Korea 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as well as 
North and South Koreas. 
  "It is fully possible to resolve the problem of the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula by 
acting in these directions. The basis of the solution should be 
a strcit observance of obligations of the agreement on 
guarantees with the iaea by Pyongyang," the Russian deputy 
foreign ministry spokesman emphasised. 
  "Russia is for North Korea remaining faithful to the Nuclear 
Weapon Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we also underscore the need 
to put into action the joint declaration about denuclearization 
of the Korean Peninsula by the North and South," Mikhail Demurin 
concluded.

  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Seeking to build a united 
and democratic Europe, member states of the Council of Europe 
should show a constructive approach to the problem of admitting 
Russia to their organisation, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing today, following the recent 
statement of British Member of Parliament D. Atkinson at a 
recent session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe. 
  According to Demurin, the British MP rather unceremoniously 
linked the problem of Russia's joining the Council of Europe 
with the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of 
foreign states, specifically, Baltic countries. Atkinson's 
"ultimatum" was regarded by some mass media organs as the 
putting forward by the Council of Europe of additional 
conditions for Russia's admittance, which are hampering and 
making more difficult the settlement of the problem of Russia's 
membership, he said. 
  The Russian side hopes that Atkinson's statements reflect 
his 
own opinion and not the feelings that predominate in the Council 
of Europe. "This is the only way it should be, because the 
attempts to link artificially two entirely different problems 
are just senseless," the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
stressed.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Changes" column: </F>
"Partnership for Partnership's Sake. Political and Economic 
Instability in Russia Complicates Cooperation With the West"] 
  [Text] From the purely formal point of view, relations 
between the long-standing opponents in the "cold" war in Europe 
-- the Soviet (now Russian) army and NATO -- have changed 
substantially. Merely a few years ago, in 1989, the two gigantic 
groupings were confronting each other, ready to fight. In spite 
of all talk about "new" thinking, both sides continued to build 
up their military might, while the disturbances in the GDR, 
which preceded the fall of the Berlin wall, could, it seemed, 
have put both sides on the verge of a large war, just like 
during the earlier Berlin crises of 1949 and 1961. 
  Now the new Russia and NATO are "partners," almost allies, 
"for peace." Reciprocal official and working visits by military 
delegations have become so common that they do not arouse great 
interest. This week, for instance, German Army General von 
Ondarza, commander of NATO Allied Armed Forces in the Central 
European War Theater, arrived in Moscow. The visit, however, is 
of a fairly nostalgic character: this war theater as such does 
not exist any longer; von Ondarza is resigning while the 
prospects for the future of the hitherto most powerful NATO 
forces in Central Europe are quite dire -- the enemy is gone, 
apparently for a long time, if not forever. At present the 
remnants of the combat effective units of the Russian troop 
grouping are being pulled out of Germany and all that will 
remain by spring will be the 6th Berlin Brigade, designed 
exclusively for military ceremonies, and some rear and special 
services. By August the withdrawal of the Russian troops will 
be completed. 
  Both NATO and the Russian Defense Ministry are now looking 
for a new raison d'etre for their coexistence on the same 
continent. General Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General 
Staff, told General von Ondarza that "we are now studying with 
great interest the Partnership for Peace program: it contains 
some sound ideas." The text of an agreement on a program of 
cooperation between NATO and the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry has been prepared and in fact is ready for signing. 
Russia is interested in closer interaction with NATO in the 
area of planning, organizing, preparing, and conducting 
peacekeeping operations and above all, in according the 
peacekeeping battalions -- the 27th Motorized Rifle Division in 
the Dniester Region, a battalion in South Ossetia, and the 201st 
Motorized Rifle Division in Tajikistan -- a more "reliable" 
international legal status (as UN or CSCE forces). NATO member 
states, however, concerned by the results of the 12 December 
elections and the danger of the "revival of Russian 
imperialism," do not intend to oblige Russia on this issue. 
  Generally, any practical moves toward implementing the 
Partnership for Peace program are unlikely any time soon. 
Primarily for economic reasons. True, joint command and staff 
exercises by the U.S. 3d Infantry Division and the Russian 27th 
"peacekeeping" Motorized Rifle Division of the Volga Military 
District have been planned for 1994 but the Russian Defense 
Ministry has no funds to conduct real joint maneuvers with NATO 
forces. The ministry has no funds even for official visits, 
although it has been flooded with invitations literally from all 
NATO countries. In the near future however economic problems 
will apparently not be the main ones. 
  The ministry is agitated by serious rumors about an early 
and 
inevitable drastic reorganization (resubordination of the 
General Staff directly to the president, and so forth) of the 
military department patterned after the reorganization of the 
Security Ministry last December. It seems that the Yeltsin 
administration is considering the third variant of the edict on 
reorganizing the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. In any 
event, the idea of "Partnership" today does not seem to be very 
topical.

Ostanin] 
  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Commander-in-chief of NATO 
Forces in Central Europe General Henning von Ondarza ended his 
four-day visit to Moscow on Thursday [3 February]. 
  Von Ondarza, 60, who is to retire in April 1994, expressed 
satisfaction with the results of his visit and confessed that he 
had always looked at the Soviet Union and its allies through 
"the gun sight." His visit has become possible due to the 
political thaw in relations between the east and west, he said. 
  In Moscow the general met with Vladimir Semenov, commander 
of 
the Russian land forces, Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the 
Russian General Staff, and other officials. 
  He welcomed Kolesnikov's words that "the General Staff of 
the 
Russian armed forces is studying the Partnership for Peace 
programme with interest. It contains good ideas. The practical 
realisation of this programme will speed up our rapprochement 
with the North- Atlantic Alliance." 
  The NATO general said NATO is ready to provide assistance to 
the peace-keeping forces of Russia and the CIS, including to 
train specialists for work in areas of inter-ethnic conflicts as 
observers. 
  Von Ondarza's visit was part of the Russia-NATO programme of 
military cooperation which envisages over 50 joint projects in 
1994, including senior officer and expert exchanges, joint 
military manoeuvres and other events.

"Russia Wins One-Billion Contract. Eastern Germany Secures 
Russian Gas Supplies Till the Year 2014"] 
  [Text] The question of implementing the so-called Orenburg 
Agreement under which Russia is supposed to deliver annually 2.8 
billion cubic meters of gas to eastern Germany seems to have 
been finally settled. 
  In the wake of the reunification of the eastern and western 
parts of the FRG, gas deliveries within the framework of the 
Orenburg Agreement remained a subject of fierce argument about 
terms of its fulfillment, which as a result took the form of the 
most serious conflict when on 15 January 1994 the sides failed 
to agree on the price of Russian gas. 
  On 20 January the conflict was squelched by raising prices, 
and the reconciliation process was continued by the signing in 
Leipzig on 31 January of a long-term contract between the 
eastern Germany company V NG and the trading house VIEKh [both 
firms as transliterated] (a joint enterprise of the Russian 
Gazprom and the German Wintershall). 
  The contract that entered into force on 1 February 1994 will 
run for 20 years. In accordance with the document, between 1994 
and 1998 V NG will be getting 3.5 billion cubic meters of 
Russian gas (at a cost of nearly 1.25 billion Deutsche marks 
[DM] to the end consumer) annually, inclusive of the delivery of 
2.8 billion cubic meters under the Orenburg Agreement. 
Beginning in 1999, the amount of deliveries under the VIEKh-V 
NG contract will be around 7 billion cubic meters a year (DM2.5 
billion). 
  In addition to what it gets under the new contract, V NG 
will 
get from Russia every year 3.5 billion cubic meters directly 
from Gazprom. 
  The long-term treaty is supposed to rule out the repetition 
of conflict situations like the one that took place in 
mid-January. The contract designates V NG as the buyer of 
Russian gas, and a revision of prices is possible once the 
situation on the fuel market changes. The document is also 
supposed to put an end to uncertainties in eastern Germany's 
fuel market and better ensure the provision of energy supplies 
to that part of the FRG.

incorporating interview with Ivan Silayev, Russia's outgoing 
ambassador to the Council of Europe, in Brussels; date not given] 
  [Text] At the end of January Ivan Silayev, Russia's 
ambassador to the Council of Europe, tendered his resignation. 
  Democratic Russia's first prime minister, Silayev received 
the appointment to Brussels after handing over his government 
duties to Yegor Gaydar at the end of 1991. To be sure, 
Silayev's new post was a kind of honorary exile, but at the same 
time a sign of gratitude on the part of the president. 
  What is behind Ivan Silayev's resignation -- dissatisfaction 
with his performance? another upcoming appointment? Our 
correspondent called the ambassador's office in Brussels: 
  [Silayev] I am not a diplomat and therefore from the very 
start of my work in this capacity I have regarded it as 
temporary. After all, before that I had worked for approximately 
40 years in industry, which has remained my main sphere of 
interest. This is why when the president visited Brussels in 
December, I asked him to consider the possibility of replacing 
me. He promised to, although he said that he had no complaints 
to make about by work. At 1000 on 20 January, in Moscow, the 
president received me for a final conversation. I stated my 
case and he agreed. Therefore on 1 March I will return to 
Russia, and I am very happy about this. I am not hoping for any 
government posts; I would like to go back to the production 
sphere. Machine building and aviation industry -- this is where 
I think my experience could be useful.

  [Text] Today's meeting of the Russian Government presidium 
was accompanied by an unpleasant surprise for journalists. They 
were told that the press, with one exception, will no longer be 
admitted to these meetings. Here is what our observer, Valeriy 
Kiosa, says: 
  [Begin recording] [Kiosa] The decision by the Russian 
Government's chief of staff to bar the press -- except for the 
government's own ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA -- from these meetings also 
took the government's own press service by surprise. It had 
taken all the usual steps to ensure that journalists accredited 
with the government could get on with their normal work today. 
  So, how did the participants in the meeting react to this 
decision? Here is what economist Pavel Bunich thinks. 
  [Bunich] I don't think this is the right way of going about 
things. There are some individual issues which the press is not 
allowed to cover, and that is understandable. 
  [Kiosa] But those are classified subjects. Today's issue was 
agriculture. 
  [Bunich] No doubt there is some scandal here which they 
don't 
want to come out. The present situation in agriculture is the 
biggest scandal of all. We have come up against a brick wall. 
How can you bar the press from government meetings? 
  [Kiosa] Here is what Andrey Illarionov, head of the prime 
minister's analysis and planning group, says. 
  [Illarionov] I think this is absolutely intolerable. It 
undoubtedly closes off the most direct and clear channel of 
information by which the public and the mass media can learn 
about what the government is deciding and doing. Unquestionably 
this can only worsen relations between the government and the 
mass media. 
  [Kiosa] Naturally we were all interested to hear the views 
of 
Vladimir Kvasov, the Russian Government's chief of staff. Here 
is what he said. 
  [Kvasov] Work is done at government meetings. Therefore, the 
only elements of the media who will be allowed to attend these 
meetings are those which are accredited with us, so to speak. I 
am referring to ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, the government newspaper. 
All their correspondents will be admitted. Other 
representatives of the media will be admitted to the opening of 
these meetings so that they can take photographs. After the 
meetings are over, news conferences on the results will be held, 
if so wished. In other words, there will be plenty of objective 
information for the press and for the radio. 
  [Kiosa] You mentioned ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. Will agencies 
like, for example, TASS -- which is also regarded as an official 
government agency -- be barred from the meetings? 
  [Kvasov] It all depends on what subjects are being 
discussed. 
Various different subjects are discussed at these meetings. If 
it's a question which interests a narrow circle of specialists, 
media access will of course be restricted. However, full 
information will be provided. 
  [Kiosa] The last point I would like to make is this: I am 
not of course disputing the government's right to decide for 
itself who will attend or not attend these meetings. However, I 
would emphasize that the moment which was chosen for this 
decision was not altogether auspicious, to put it mildly. As 
you know, many government actions are being sharply criticized 
at the moment. It was at this precise moment, when you might 
expect the government to have an interest in the fullest and 
most objective reporting of what it is really doing, that the 
government's chief of staff suddenly decided to bar journalists 
from the meetings -- for good, or so it seems from his words. 
This is the first time such a thing has happened for two years, 
I stress. [end recording]

economic conditions in which the agro-industrial complex will be 
functioning in 1994, meaures to maintain and develop small 
businesses, state mamagement of labor protection, progress in 
the implementation of decisions on overcoming the aftermath of 
the Ossetian-Ingush armed conflict, and also the government work 
schedule for the first and second quarters. 
  At that point IZVESTIYA is forced to conclude its account of 
the government session -- the paper has no further details. The 
same goes for correspondents of other papers. Henceforth, on 
instructions from the head of the government apparatus, only the 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA representative will be allowed to attend 
Cabinet sessions. 
  The apparatus' denying journalists access to government news 
is big news in itself. As ITAR-TASS reported, for the first 
time in two and one-half years even news agency and television 
correspondents were barred from a Cabinet session. But we must 
be more precise: It is not the journalists, whom the government 
apparatus head probably does not respect, who have been deprived 
of information. No, it is society that is being starved of 
government information, its interest in the government having 
been whetted by the reshuffle and the perturbing statements by 
the premier. 
  Actually, that is probably the reason why the door was 
hastily and brusquely closed to Russian and foreign 
correspondents. Presumably, the kind of thing that another 
venerator of press freedom -- Ruslan Khasbulatov -- described as 
"attacks" and "subversive activity," advising the press "not to 
harbor any illusions about being a fourth power," will no longer 
seep through the narrow crack left for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, the 
official government organ. 
  Were the questions submitted for government examination on 3 
February secret? No, the press service spokesman who relieved 
journalists of their professional duties that day, did not refer 
to any secrecy. Which makes it all the more interesting. Even 
more interesting than before, when, whether approving of or 
cursing the government, citizens at least knew or could guess 
what to expect of it. Even more interesting, because at the 
moment few people have any idea what "nonmonetarist methods" of 
combatting inflation mean or how to reconcile the statement that 
handing out "preferential credits right, left, and center" is to 
stop, with the intention to issue them "selectively." 
  We will find out in the end, probably very soon. Closed 
doors, behind which government policy will apparently be 
conducted henceforth, are the most unreliable method of guarding 
against public and, as is the custom everywhere, critical 
attention to the work of the Cabinet of Ministers. This is 
confirmed by the absurd way the Council of Ministers has 
isolated itself from the press, a method borrowed from the 
practice of the unforgettable Politburo.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Orlov report under the "Court" rubric: "Valeriy </F>
Zorkin Wears Gown Again"] 
  [Excerpts] Former Constitutional Court Chairman Valeriy 
Zorkin has been fully reinstated in his rights as a judge -- an 
equal among the 13. He himself assessed the event as "just and 
logical." [passage omitted] 
  There are currently three most painful questions before the 
"frozen" court. The first is about the time for being "thawed." 
This will probably not happen until two months from now, when a 
new law on the Constitutional Court has been passed (the text is 
ready and awaits its turn in the Duma). Second is the question 
of its chairman. Few people see in this post the current acting 
chairman, Nikolay Vitruk, who has lately proven himself a 
conformist. Valeriy Zorkin no longer aspires to fill the vacant 
chair. But it is hard to imagine an outsider [varyag] becoming 
chairman, although in the wings Andrey Makarov and Mikhail 
Fedotov are still being named. The president's obvious 
supporters -- Nikolay Vitruk, Tamara Morshchakova, and Ernest 
Ametistov are so far in the minority. The third question is 
about by-elections. Under the new constitution, the number of 
judges should be increased to 19. All the "newcomers" should be 
nominated by the president and confirmed by the State Duma. 
  Valeriy Zorkin believes that the Constitutional Court still 
has a chance to "contribute to the restoration of a normal 
constitutional system." Talking with your MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI 
correspondent, Zorkin spoke for a "strong, capable authority." 
Asked if he implied a strong presidential authority, he 
replied: "Of course. Whatever they may say, I am a resolute 
advocate of a very strong presidential authority. With one 
reservation: in the existence of a strong parliament." 
  Valeriy Zorkin believes that the Court would be able to 
cooperate with the new legislative branch. As for the executive 
branch, "this is a delicate question, and I would prefer to 
skirt it." The ex-chairman now generally prefers to duck 
"purely political" questions: "This is no time today for 
showdowns. On the contrary, common grounds should be sought." 
  Information has leaked into the press of late that a "broad 
coalition of opposition non-radical forces" is being created and 
that Zorkin would probably come to lead this movement. He is 
not ready to confirm such reports: "When I read them, I was 
amazed. I am a judge so far, and I stay aloof from politics."

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Nikolay Golushko, director </F>
of Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, by Valeriy 
Yakov; place and date not given: "Lubyanka in the Third Circle. 
Colonel General Nikolay Golushko, Director of Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, Answers IZVESTIYA Special 
Correspondent Valeriy Yakov's Questions"] 
  [Text] This conversation had been repeatedly postponed, 
but the arguments presented by the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] were so convincing that I frequently had to agree 
with them. What indeed could you say when the president's edict 
abolishing the Ministry of Security came as a surprise to the 
actual ministry (at least that was what many of this 
department's high-ranking personnel said) and the structure of 
the new organization -- the FCS -- had to be developed virtually 
from scratch? 
  Despite having a host of formal reasons for canceling this, 
his first major interview in his new post, Nikolay Golushko 
finally named a specific time and the conversation went ahead. 
  It was a frosty morning, and dapper men filed from the 
subway 
to the main entrance of the new Lubyanka building in a hurry to 
start their working day and, judging by their numbers, personnel 
cuts are not yet over here. 
  After studying my editorial ID card and that of the 
photographer, the cheerful warrant officers at the entrance 
asked us to wait for General A. Izmodenov, the director's aide, 
to come down to get us. We went up to the fourth floor with 
him. There was a deserted corridor with the traditional carpet 
runner and locked doors on both sides bearing no name plates, 
just numbers. The general suddenly opened a door that was hardly 
different from the rest (apart from the fact that it was made of 
metal and covered in leather of a different color) and we found 
ourselves in a spacious reception room. The director's office, 
the windows of which look over the courtyard, seemed huge at 
first (when you worked out how many paces it is to the main 
desk), but N. Golushko was already halfway to greet us and our 
initial impression diminished. 
  There were a host of files of various colors on the desk. 
The aide moved some of them, the biggest ones, to one side. On 
the left there was a bank of telephones. The furniture and 
light fittings were not luxurious, but very good-quality and 
blended well with one another. You feel as if you are in an 
ordinary modern department (although not a poor one), but by no 
means inside a bureaucratic building with a scary past. The 
Russian flag stood on the corner of the desk and behind the 
director there was a picture of the president. 
  [Yakov] Nikolay Mikhaylovich, the Statute on the FCS has 
been adopted and approved by the president, but the crux of it 
is still unclear; are we to see it as a guide for action and is 
the Law on Federal Security Organs no longer valid? 
  [Golushko] The main content of the Statute on the FCS deals 
with the formation of a new centralized special service which, 
coupled with other existing structures, will have the duty of 
ensuring the country's state security. It is a question of 
creating this service in a radical, revolutionary way and top 
officials from the Security Council and the president's 
administration are involved in this work along with the leaders 
of components of the Federation.... The Statute defines the 
functional tasks of the FCS, which is transformed into a special 
service and will in effect cease to be a law enforcement organ. 
  Acording to the Statute, the task of the FCS is to work to 
expose, avert, and suppress intelligence-gathering and 
subversive activity by foreign special services and 
organizations and illegal encroachments on Russia's 
constitutional system, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
defense capability. The unified counterintelligence system 
incorporates territorial and regional organs in republics, 
krays, and oblasts and military counterintelligence organs in 
the Armed Forces, Border Guard Troops and Internal Troops, and 
other Russian Federation military formations. I would 
particularly like to stress that, according to the Statute, all 
FCS activity will be carried out strictly in accordance with the 
requirements of the Russian Constitution and the law -- 
including the Laws On Security, On Organs of State Security, and 
On Operational-Investigative Activity. 
  [Yakov] Today are there any of your deputies or collegium 
members who are not members of these organs? What criteria do 
you use to certify them apart from the wide-ranging concepts of 
"sense of duty" and "loyalty to the motherland"? Has the 
presidential apparatus certified anyone? 
  [Golushko] The certification commission headed by O. Lobov 
is at work virtually every day from 1830 to 2200 or 2300 hours. 
Yu. Baturin, S. Kovalev, N. Medvedev, S. Stepashin, and others 
are on the commission. Standing orders have been formulated as 
well as the procedure for introducing the members of the 
leadership to the president. The commission has already 
approved the appointment of over 20 leadership personnel after 
conversations with them. 
  A commission has been set up to certify operational cadres, 
including at local level. All this involves more than just a 
formal examination of their CV's or personal affairs. 
Conversations are held with every staffer who is being 
considered for a leadership post. People who were tipped for 
top roles are eliminated. The criteria include the following: 
Job assessment, practical results over the last two years -- 
since 1991 -- and any penalties or breaches of discipline. We 
see whether citizens have made any complaints about human rights 
violations by the person concerned. Our people's willingness to 
serve in any part of the country and work in the "hot spots" is 
also appreciated. After all, we have always had representatives 
of our central apparatus everywhere in addition to local 
personnel. Last year two of our staffers died in Tajikistan on 
an official tour of duty. Incidentally, Aleksandr Izmodenov, 
who met you, spent two months working in Abkhazia, cooperating 
with the special services, the leadership, and representatives 
of the Foreign Ministry, and performing tasks in Russia's 
interests. I could also cite many examples with regard to other 
regions. 
  [Yakov] Nonetheless, Nikolay Mikhaylovich, how will the new 
special service differ from the previous one if it still has the 
same people holding the same ranks and working in the same 
buildings with the same files, and the same agents? 
  [Golushko] What can I say? Only that the new generation of 
security organs in the new Russia is most likely still at school 
and studying at higher educational establishments. 
  We had a number of academy graduates, we have deployed 400 
people, I think that these are the personnel responsible for the 
future. But an operational worker or a counterintelligence 
staffer, who generally has a knowledge of languages, does not 
drop out of the sky so easily. 
  I do not think it right today to reproach our personnel for 
the department's sins of old. They are not after all being 
certified for the first time. A considerable number of people 
were discharged after August 1991. The second phase occurred 
when the Ministry of Security was being set up, a fairly tough 
elimination policy was applied there too. Now yet another 
certification process is under way. 
  [Yakov] Some 45 percent of Ministry of Security personnel 
will be left out of the FCS and there is no guarantee that the 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or the tax police will want 
to take on your rejects. What does the future hold for them 
then, which structures will grow stronger with their experience 
-- criminal or commercial structures, the parties of Zyuganov, 
Zhirinovskiy, or Barkashov?... 
  [Golushko] Every staffer's future is decided on an 
individual basis. Some will retire on a pension, others will go 
to the MVD, those with a knowledge of languages will go into 
foreign intelligence. The coming certification process should 
not be described as a "weeding-out process," much less should 
citizens of the united Russian state be divided into "them" and 
"us" according to party orientation. 
  We estimate that most professionals will continue working 
in new jobs in the interests of Russia. Our former colleagues' 
possible involvement in criminal structures can cause nothing 
but regret. 
  [Yakov] The experience of the last few years provides 
convincing evidence that coups d'etat and mass disturbances may 
be provoked not only by foreign special services, but also by 
Russian politicians. The Ministry of Security was unable to 
prevent the previous disturbances and coups, which department 
will now forecast and prevent such events? 
  [Golushko] In my view, one should not be so categorical in 
assessing security organs' activity to prevent what you call the 
"coups d'etat and mass disturbances" of the past few years. The 
law prohibited the Ministry of Security from operating in 
political parties and movements. However, top organs of power 
were constantly briefed on all anticonstitutional, extremist, 
and radical manifestations. Including on the "Barkashovites," 
long before the tragic events. 
  Today, in our view, one should not name a single organ that 
will engage in "forecasting and preventive work." The 
Commission for Public Security set up within the Ministry of 
Security can coordinate law enforcement organs and the special 
services, the FCS included, in order to perform similar tasks. 
  But political parties and movements must be monitored by the 
Justice Ministry, as envisaged by the Law on Public Associations 
(this pertains to the constant question of "political 
investigation"). 
  [Yakov] Counterintelligence presupposes the existence of an 
enemy, whom your work is to "counter." But whereas previously 
any pioneer activist could have been called the enemy of the 
homeland, how will things stand now? Whom do you assume to be 
your enemies in distant foreign parts and will you have enemies 
in nearby foreign countries? 
  [Golushko] We are acting on a different principle and will 
not organize our work on territorial or any geographical 
grounds. Or on the basis of membership of a particular bloc. We 
will combat those special services that are conducting specific 
subversive activity against Russia. 
  [Yakov] What will you do with the NKVD, KGB, and Ministry of 
Security archives; what principle will you use to divide them up 
between the new special services? 
  [Golushko] A considerable proportion of the archive material 
has been declassified by a special commission -- this includes 
material on the czar's family, Bulgakov, Sholokhov, Florenskiy, 
and Kozin. Systematic work is under way to transfer documents 
that have no bearing on counterintelligence to the Russian State 
Archive Service. There are plans for us to join other 
establishments in declassifying material on scientific and 
cultural figures during the totalitarian regime, on the state, 
religion, the Korean war, and so on. And, most importantly, to 
further review cases for rehabilitation. 
  [Yakov] There were only 19 investigators, conducting 400 
cases, for the 60 vacancies in the Moscow Ministry of Security's 
Investigation Department. The vacancies and cases are now being 
transferred to the Prosecutor's Office, but investigators are 
refusing to transfer, what lies in store for these cases and the 
people under investigation? 
  [Golushko] Our special service is losing its role as a law 
enforcement organ, it is being stripped of investigation 
subunits, merely retaining inquiry functions [funktsii 
doznaniya]. Therefore around 2,000 criminal cases being worked 
on by the Ministry of Security (as of 18 January 58 cases, 
including eight criminal cases, had been transferred to the 
Moscow Prosecutor's Office, whereby 17 people had been arrested 
and it has been agreed to hand over another 220 cases) are being 
handed over to the General Prosecutor's Office and its organs at 
local level. To date 62 out of 76 FCS territorial organs have 
handed over material to the prosecutor's office. All military 
counterintelligence cases have been handed over. As for 
investigators, each will have an opportunity, if they so desire, 
to continue serving in the FCS after they have been certified. 
  [Yakov] What lies in store for your former agents? You 
cannot after all divide them up among the new services, it would 
probably be easier to put them on ice until better times come 
along? 
  [Golushko] Work with agents has of late been put on a legal 
footing. You probably know that a law was adopted allowing us 
to have confidential sources. It defined the rights and duties 
of citizens who cooperate with state security organs. I do not 
think that there will be any problem with them, especially since 
the size of the agent apparatus has been considerably reduced 
compared with the KGB. 
  [Yakov] So, the so-called operational reserve officers 
[ofitsery deystvuyushchego rezerva] will still be working under 
various "umbrellas"? 
  [Golushko] The institution of operational reserve officers 
or the practice of attaching [prikomandirovaniye] special 
service officers to ministries, departments, organizations, 
establishments, and firms is not our invention, but is used by 
all the world's special services -- and fairly effectively at 
that. I can confidently say today that critical assessments of 
the attached personnel are fairly rare and are often an 
interpersonal thing. Our tactics for handling reserve officers 
and attached personnel will meet requirements and the tasks that 
the FCS can feasibly perform. Naturally, mindful of requests 
from heads of establishments, departments, and firms. 
  [Yakov] The Lubyanka complex, secret rendezvous, training 
centers, recreational bases, the Ministry of Security academy... 
-- who will divide up this property belonging to the people, 
how, and between whom? 
  [Golushko] The president's edict has assigned the federal 
service crucial tasks, and the corresponding material, 
financial, and operational base will be needed to resolve them. 
What is more, the FCS safeguards the interests of intelligence 
personnel, border guards, and the protection service [sluzhba 
okhrany], and that is why we are not currently facing the 
question of dividing up the material base. 
  [Yakov] Sizeable expenditure is needed for the upkeep of 
this sizeable base and you probably already have estimates as to 
the FCS budget for 1994. Following the 46-percent cut in 
personnel, should we expect your budget to drop by roughly the 
same proportion compared with the Ministry of Security? 
  [Golushko] Of course. Spending on cadre pay will drop 
considerably. 
  [Yakov] What will be the resulting figure? 
  [Golushko] At the moment we do not have a budget and it is 
hard for me to give you a thorough answer. As far as January at 
least is concerned we were given funding in December based on 
the number of staff. 
  [Yakov] A good answer. I would even say a significant 
answer. Well then, could you be a little more specific and tell 
us how much a middle-ranking FCS staffer and the director are 
paid? 
  [Golushko] Let's ask now, just a minute. (He repeated the 
question down the intercom, probably to a financial expert. The 
following response came: "An operational worker at the center 
earns 156,598 rubles, but I did not make enquiries about the 
minister." Golushko laughed. -- V.Ya.). Well then, that's what 
our pay is like. The director's pay is like that of any 
minister. Plus an allowance for rank and years of service. 
  [Yakov] Nikolay Mikhaylovich, your department recently made 
the surprise revelation to the press that last year alone the 
Ministry of Security arrested 20 spies and a number of top 
bosses were discharged following a Ministry of Security report 
on their contacts with foreign intelligence services. But no 
names were given although the press was very keen to know who 
these bosses were and the reason for their dismissal. 
  [Golushko] The former ministry of security did indeed expose 
a number of spies working for the foreign special services. A 
number of so-called "go-it-aloners" [initsiativniki] were also 
uncovered. Criminal proceedings have been instituted against 
some people and preventive-explanatory work carried out with 
others. 
  Where possible, we provide the newspapers with specific 
figures and information. I can tell you, for instance, that in 
January the FCS arrested a Russian citizen whose activity was 
doing damage comparable, from preliminary estimates, to that of 
the Penkovskiy or Tolkachev case. (Shortly before this 
conversation N.M. Golushko promised IZVESTIYA an exclusive 
chance to talk about this case. But during the conversation he 
regrettably confined himself to just a single sentence -- V.Ya.) 
  We realize that journalists and readers need clear facts. 
But you must understand our position too, we can by no means 
talk about everything in the interests of the cause, secrets may 
be revealed in time. 
  [Yakov] Do you think that the FCS will be around for a long 
time or until the next election when our next leaders will start 
carving up the special services again, most likely in their own 
political interests rather than the interests of the state? 
  [Golushko] Sad as it is to admit, but your question does 
imply the corresponding answer. Although, as I have already 
told you, there is nothing bad per se in the special services 
being reorganized, and many highly developed countries are doing 
this mindful of the global geopolitical changes. 
  But let us not predict whether the FCS will be around for a 
long time or not. I think that everything will depend on how 
the service actually proves its effectiveness in defending the 
interests of the people and the Fatherland. And whether it will 
be "small change" in politicians' actions and "cops the flak" 
after they mess up. 
  [Yakov] Have you contemplated your possible retirement? 
  [Golushko] I see that as a natural process and I think that 
the time will nonetheless come in our country when a change of 
government will not be a supernatural event and the resignation 
of individual leaders will cease to appear a tragedy. 
  [Yakov] Thus I see that you are mentally prepared for that 
twist of fate. But what then -- will you write your memoirs, 
take up political activity, set up an association to guard 
banks, go fishing? 
  [Golushko] I will not be setting up any associations. As 
for writing my memoirs, I have my memories. I know how state 
security organs work. I have personally been involved in 
operational work and in investigating a number of notorious 
cases, and I have been well acquainted with very famous 
people.... But I have not as yet made any specific plans in 
this direction, I am not in the mood. 
  [Yakov] Have you deliberately omitted fishing? I 
deliberately put that question to you in order to get some idea 
of what you are like outside work. 
  [Golushko] Outside work I used to prefer reading. I was 
familiar with and loved a great deal of poetry, in particular 
Pushkin and Yevtushenko. I don't have any particular passions 
apart from picking mushrooms. But I haven't seen any mushrooms 
for about two years now. 
  [Yakov] Nikolay Mikhaylovich, Zhirinovskiy once said that if 
he comes to power he will revive the KGB. If he does indeed 
come to power, how soon, in your view, will he be able to turn 
back the clock? 
  [Golushko] It is no longer possible to revive anything now, 
the things that have gone have disappeared never to return. But 
there could be completely new organs.

<F P=106> ["Part Two" of Natalya Kuzina series: "A Leader for Russia"] </F>
  [Text] A Rival's Fate 
  The story of how Aleksandr Rutskoy became an independent 
leader is not particularly original. But it is virtually 
identical to the rise of Yeltsin. Like Yeltsin, Rutskoy rose to 
prominence alongside the head of state. His policy was based on 
criticizing the president's entourage, but not the big man 
himself. In the same way, Yeltsin criticized the CPSU elite for 
a long time, while stressing that he and Gorbachev only differed 
with regard to reform tactics. The Army was also sympathetic to 
Rutskoy. According to one survey, he was supported by one-third 
of the officer corps. Not bad for a beginning. 
  Boris Yeltsin did not immediately win the sympathies of the 
military. Their friendship grew as resentment grew against 
Gorbachev, who unequivocally "betrayed" the Army: After the 
events in Vilnius, for example. Yeltsin, on the other hand, 
promised to show concern. It is clear from the fortunes of many 
of today's generals that he kept his promise after the 
Belovezhskaya Forest Agreement. But the number of dissatisfied 
military men is, of course, far greater. Rutskoy could 
perfectly well count on them to improve his rating. 
  Admittedly, he did not really have a ramified political 
structure to fulfill agitation and propaganda functions, if only 
along the lines of "Democratic Russia." The "Free Russia" 
People's Party (FRPP), only nominally headed by Rutskoy, was not 
noted for its organization. "Civic Union" hesitated to nominate 
him as its leader, and, moreover, was actively engaged in 
infighting. 
  The opposition's support was not so much unconditional as 
desperate. The hardliners still had not nominated a leader. 
Indeed, they could not. Only in propaganda folklore is it 
possible to firmly unite monarchists and communists. In real 
life they could only reach a compromise. Rutskoy proved to be 
the bridge they needed. But, as his popularity grew, these and 
many other factors moved into the background. 
  Two or three weeks before the tragic events at the White 
House, the "Public Opinion" Foundation carried out a survey to 
establish the degree of popular support for the various 
political blocs. The results were stunning. Particularly 
considering the election results. "Civic Union" emerged as the 
undisputed leader. It was even several steps ahead of 
"Democratic Russia" and "Russia's Choice." But, while placing a 
high degree of trust in "Civic Union," contrary to the true 
state of affairs, the population linked it to Rutskoy's name. 
On the other hand, at that time 71 percent of respondents were 
negative about Yeltsin's activity. 
  The conclusion is obvious: Aleksandr Rutskoy was very 
successfully ousting the Russian president from the public 
consciousness. If there had been simultaneous early elections, 
the idea of which was being actively discussed at the time, the 
result would have been predetermined. The events around the 
White House could not have come at a better time. One can 
understand the irritation of some radicals that Rutskoy did not 
shoot himself. 
  Was Rutskoy still a rival to Yeltsin? There are politicians 
who, thanks to their courageous behavior, have gone straight 
from jail into palace apartments. However, there are also those 
who have voluntarily left politics. But it is a fact that 
Rutskoy is not forgotten. According to the "Person-93" poll 
carried out by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public 
Opinion, he confidently holds fourth place in the popularity 
ratings. His name largely helped V. Lipitskiy's victory in the 
election campaign. The FRPP, on the other hand -- neatly blended 
into the "Future of Russia-New Names" bloc, which no one had 
ever heard of -- suffered defeat. The FRPP now intends to take 
part in elections to local bodies of authority under its own 
identity and with Rutskoy's name. 
  However, was it worth Rutskoy's while to undertake such a 
dangerous venture as setting up an independent political party? 
After all, his fortunes could have turned out quite well. He 
was the first official in Russian history -- and, according to 
the now abolished Constitution, the last -- to be publicly 
declared as successor to the president. He had gained some 
popularity among the people, uttered a few words of criticism, 
and consequently distanced himself from Yeltsin, so all he had 
to do was sit patiently by, not thrust himself forward, and bide 
his time in order to smoothly make the transition to the 
president's chair. 
  Yes, but in that case the person would have to be a 
political 
sophisticate, rather than a military man like Rutskoy. 
Moreover, the traditional pattern of ascent is not in itself a 
guarantee of success. However the contender for the post of 
president may maneuver, whatever parties he may form, and 
whatever deals he may make even with the Army, he will 
nevertheless come up against the wall that is the elite. He 
could break through, of course. But that would require a 
revolution -- even if it is a velvet revolution -- or a military 
coup d'etat. A peaceful outcome is only possible in one case: 
If the contender reflects the interests of the elite. 

<H5>    Zhirinovskiy -- A Shield For the Elite? </H5>
  However paradoxical it may seem, Zhirinovskiy is exactly the 
candidate for president who plays entirely by the rules of the 
present elite. His views are its views. His interests are its 
interests, that is, the interests of big capital. That is the 
main point. Zhirinovskiy's criticism of the policy of reforms 
goes no further than criticizing its tactics. This kind of 
condemnation can be continued for a very long time with 
absolutely no harm to the policy itself. 
  As far as his bellicose plans are concerned, the "rush to 
the 
south," they are more a tribute to tradition. India attracted 
the attention of Peter I. Paul I could not restrain himself: 
He dispatched the Don Army to wage war on India, soon after 
which he was killed. The expedition ended there. The famous 
General Skobelev nurtured global ideas of uniting all the Slav 
lands.... 
  Why should Zhirinovskiy not recall all this, and our elite 
as 
well? With its chameleon-like abilities, it is perfectly 
capable of speaking in a patriotic bass, even if it does concern 
such details as the color of television presenters' hair and 
eyes. 
  Incidentally, Zhirinovskiy himself understands perfectly 
well 
that, without the elite, he has no real road to power: Support 
for him is not so very great, which is why some extraordinary 
measures and Russia's desperate plight are needed. Is the 
lawyer's son capable of taking all this upon his shoulders? 
  The elite's position is no better: It has no one in reserve 
for the role of president. The opposition is breathing down its 
neck. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy has taken his seat next to 
Yeltsin and Filatov for all to see. He has already done the 
elite quite a service by supporting the Constitution. In his 
own interests, of course. But it is ludicrous to expect 
altruism of a politician. Finally, no one before Zhirinovskiy 
has shown such staggering loyalty to power: to Gorbachev, the 
State Committee for the State of Emergency, Yeltsin himself, and 
even those in the White House. Having condemned the Lefortovo 
prisoners' opposition to Edict No. 1440, he now advocates 
releasing them. Zhirinovskiy treats power like a sacred cow, 
thereby guaranteeing the survival of the elite and its property 
in the event of his victory. 
  The process of adapting to each other's characters and 
interests is now under way. Zhirinovskiy impetuously 
demonstrates what he is capable of doing. The elite reflects. 
Zhirinovskiy says something coarse. The elite frowns in 
disdain. But it will also smile if it has to. 

<H5>    The Leader's Name Is Compromise </H5>
  Of course it has been offensive to watch the new elite 
scheming against "outsiders" and trying to fashion a new leader 
for the last year or so. We can do little more than lament the 
fact that our elite is bad. But if we were to stage another 
revolution, we would get an elite no better than the last, and, 
moreover, with the same qualities and resources at its disposal. 
Why each successive reproduction should be distinguished by 
this permanency and how we can limit its growth is another 
matter. But the elite's job is to supply leaders great and 
small; intrigues cannot be avoided. 
  Another irritating feature is that a course rejected by 
society is being dictated to the incumbent president. 
Persistent efforts are being made to ensure that others 
continue this work. Not only various political institutions, 
such as the Army, are being approached for their support. 
History is also being brought into service. Lavishing praise 
on autocracy, attention is focused on the "strong hand" with 
which it so gloriously held Russia. However, the present power 
has forgotten the monarch's main concern: To try to achieve a 
balance between the passions of the elite and the people. 
History also teaches us that when the autocrat listed toward 
one side, the other side hatched conspiracies, rebelled, and 
sometimes carefully removed him or swept him aside. 
  Nothing has changed since then. The White House tragedy 
and the failure of reform stem from a disregard of experience. 
Having begun his political ascent from ruin, Yeltsin does not 
realize that the historical imperative has gone. The leader's 
task today is not to show superhuman qualities, but to master 
the art of compromise. 
  The theme of compromise is not new. From the moment it was 
formed, "Civic Union" reiterated the need for compromise in 
politics and the need to seek ways leading to accord. There is 
progress in this respect among some members of the opposition. 
Even the president has expressed a desire to cooperate with all 
forces in the Federal Assembly. It can be said that attempts 
are being made to get along with one another. The only 
exception in this is the main participant in the process, the 
ruling elite itself. So far, its backbone in the State Duma 
intends to demonstrate the principles of the noncontamination of 
the democratic ranks by the influence of extreme forces. 
Although, as is well known, the stance taken by extreme 
elements changes with time. 
  It is not just caprice, of course. These are the torments of 
Tantalus. After all, behind every compromise lies the need to 
moderate one's appetite in the consumption of power and make 
room for others in these very ranks. 
  But there is no going back. No less than 40 percent of the 
electorate in our country are romantics. The 40 percent who did 
not turn up to vote. The "left wing" and the "right wing" are 
in a hurry to enter them in their assets. A futile exercise. 
These people are not yours. Most of them say: "We do not 
trust anyone." So they are waiting.... They are waiting for 
the right person to come along. In a country which still has 
open wounds left by the destruction of a great state. They 
wait, scornfully observing the petty intrigues "above." They 
wait, with no future, soaring prices, and rocketing crime. They 
include a vast mass of people who know from experience how you 
have to go about begging for something. Where is the guarantee 
that this wave of desperation, fearlessness, and need will not 
one day surge through the country, sweeping aside everything in 
its path, to the impassioned appeals of the latest spokesman for 
the aspirations of the masses? 
  If the present elite is really an elite, its direct duty is 
to make room for others, cultivate a leader capable of balancing 
on the cutting edge of the interests of all strata of the 
population, and promote a figure on whom the main political 
forces will agree. Only then will they have to bury their vast 
talent -- their ability to make our life hell. 
  If the elite does not do its duty, the time of noble heroes, 
the Minins and Pozharskiys of this world, will come. How do we 
know who they are? Where are they now: In the crowd jostling 
at the throne, on the barricades, on the firing lines of our 
divided country? There is no answer to these questions. These 
people will come like lightning, like a sword. When the time 
for compromise has run out. Or been let slip by arrogant 
rulers. When the country is not simply on the brink, but in the 
abyss. 
  Incidentally, Prince Pozharskiy was a Ryurikovich. With his 
services to the fatherland, he had every right to the throne. 
But, for the sake of peace in Russia, he spoke out in favor of 
Mikhail Romanov, a figure of compromise who suited the hostile 
boyar families. 
  To this day, historians cannot say with certainty where 
exactly this great man is buried. Moreover, doubts arose even 
during the reign of the Romanov dynasty. 
  Is this coincidence or the revenge of the elite: To wipe out 
every trace of an example offering the key to compromise?

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, </F>
president of the International Reform Fund and academician 
secretary of the Russian Academy of Sciences Economics 
Department, by Sergey Lomakin; from the "Utro" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Lomakin] Now as I warned you earlier, our guest is 
Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, president of the International 
Reform Fund and academician secretary of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences Economics Department. The topic of our discussion, of 
course, is the report prepared by the Reform Fund and the 
Russian Academy of Sciences Economics Department, which is 
entitled "Social and Economic Transformation in Russia: The 
Contemporary Situation and New Approaches." As I understand it, 
it is an analysis of the past two years and a forecast for 
actions in the future. 
  [Shatalin] Yes, indeed, the report analyses what has 
happened during the past two years and makes the initial 
conclusions, that the tasks set by the government to reform our 
economy have not been fulfilled. I would like to be understood 
correctly. We -- I mean myself, naturally, and my colleagues 
and work comrades -- are all supporters of a market economy. 
These are not empty words and so I totally reject any labels in 
this regard. Problems about changing to a market economy do not 
exist. This must be understood once and for all. Nobody 
supports a retreat and there is no going back. 
  In this sense, as we see it, our report gives a fairly 
concentrated view of [words indistinct]. What do they consist 
of? We declare -- or demand if you wish -- that there needs to 
be a distinctive public agreement, a social agreement, between 
all levels of society on the social cost of the reforms. There 
must be parameters, such social indicators as living standards; 
spending on science, on health, on culture, on education; the 
employment level; and other parameters which any reformer in 
carrying out any policy, be it a monetary or nonmonetary or 
supra-monetary policy, must not exceed. He must... 
  [Lomakin, interrupting] In other words, something must be 
immutable. 
  [Shatalin] Something needs to be like a wall which cannot be 
destroyed. It is a limit within the framework of which you have 
a right to act. Do everything else you want, reform the 
economy, but this is the boundary which cannot be crossed. 
  We consider that the people should be told honestly and 
frankly what will happen and when, without deceit, in a sober 
and calm way. I cannot say that we have said everything, but 
nevertheless we have outlined the main contours of economic 
development. We support the creation of a socially oriented 
economy. This is not demagoguery. This kind of economy was 
created by (Ludwig Herford) and economies of this kind exist in 
Europe and beyond. This is a highly efficient economy and in 
terms of its motivation and development vectors, so to speak, it 
is aimed at putting people at the forefront, at ensuring a 
social orientation and motivation. In other words, we would 
have an economy which clearly works to improve the standard of 
living and which organically combines economic efficiency and 
social justice. 
  It is extremely difficult to find a balance between these 
two 
facets. The world has searched for it as have entire 
civilizations. Europe, Sweden, Austria, France, and Great 
Britain are searching for it. And in this, everything depends 
on professionalism, not on ideological affiliations. 
Professionalism permits the fusion of economic efficiency with 
social justice. We support the idea of adequate government 
intervention, intervention which distinguishes between various 
spheres. The agrarian sector is one thing while financial and 
credit policy is another. Pricing policy is one thing while 
taxation issues are another. There are also foreign economic 
relations, and so forth. Adequate solutions must be found in 
various spheres and these are mechanisms of government 
regulation of the economy. 
  We oppose revolution. Enough. Whoever it is, I do not want 
to name any names now. I do not want to associate the reforms 
being carried out in Russia with any names. This is not the 
crux of the problem. The crux of the problem lies essentially 
in what we are doing. What we began doing in 1992 is, if you 
wish, a new revolution. Berdyayev, who I am very fond of, said 
that revolutions are never successful. The course of the 
economic revolution in Russia during the past two years shows 
that Russia's latest revolution has not been successful. 
  [Lomakin] Excuse me, I have to interrupt you since we do 
not have all that much time, but I have a question which I am 
simply obliged to ask you. I have the Saturday, 29 January 
issue of IZVESTIYA and its front page headline reads: Gorbachev 
Era Economic Advisers Propose Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin a New 
Life in the Old Style. It deals with your report, prepared by 
Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, Abalkin, and Petrakov, but to 
put it mildly very little of your report comes through here. So 
this is the first criticism to be leveled at it. Have you 
published your report anywhere? Have you read this article? 
  [Shatalin] Yes, I have read it. My colleagues showed it to 
me today after their Sunday day off. It includes a lot of lies 
and distortions. It says that IZVESTIYA was the first to get 
this report. This is a lie. The first real copy of this 
report, not a manuscript of the report, was received by Russian 
Federation President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin on Friday, 28 
January. Yesterday we sent this report to the Russian 
Government. The report was sent to the Federal Assembly and we 
plan to send it to all the papers, and so forth. I do not know 
how IZVESTIYA managed to get this report. 
  Moreover, you know, there is another unpleasant side to 
this. 
This kind of criticism immediately gives the discussion an 
unbusinesslike tone. After all, we are talking about problems 
which are vitally important to Russia and the people and this 
kind of criticism does not help a calm discussion of the 
problems. It creates a neo-Bolshevist tone. I would say that 
rather than write Gorbachev Era Economic Advisers Propose 
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin a New Life in the Old Style, they 
should have written Enemies of the People Propose Yeltsin and 
Chernomyrdin a New Life in the Old Style. It would have given 
it more sting, right? It is understandable, because this kind 
of newspaper is already calling us enemies of the people. 
  Since you mention IZVESTIYA, I will add that previously I 
respected it very highly and the journalists and staff who work 
there too. You know that, unfortunately, now more and more 
newspapers...[pauses] I have forgotten its name. Previously it 
was DEN, now it is called POZAVCHERA [DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY], I 
cannot remember, or POSLEZAVTRA [DAY AFTER TOMORROW]. I cannot 
remember exactly. This does not do the paper any credit. 
  I do not know how my colleagues will react to this 
criticism, 
that is their problem. I am not at all surprised that certain 
names are being bandied around. The main thing is that this 
kind of statement is an obstacle to the real task. 
  [Lomakin] Stanislav Sergeyevich, would it not be better to 
wait until the specialists actually read the report and become 
familiar with it, until the president has familiarized himself 
with the report and the government and parliamentary deputies 
familiarize themselves with it, and then discuss it. I think 
that this would be the normal course of action. 
  [Shatalin] This is precisely what we expect. We are not 
monopolists. We write about this honestly. We do not have a 
monopoly on the truth and nobody else does. We support a really 
calm, professional discussion of this report without any 
political hysterics and, if there is anything sensible in it, 
that can promote the beginning of a real market reform of our 
economy, personally I would only be happy. 
  [Lomakin] I am sure that is exactly what will happen. 
Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, academician and president of 
the International Reform Fund. Today we talked about the report 
which this fund, together with the Russian Academy of Sciences 
Economics Department, has presented to the top people in our 
state for discussion. Thank you. 
  [Shatalin] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Air Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov by </F>
Aleksandr Zhilin, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI military commentator: 
"Weapons in Clean Hands"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Under Boris Yeltsin's edict, Air Marshal Yevgeniy 
Shaposhnikov has been appointed the president's representative 
in Rosvooruzheniye [State Company for the Export and Import of 
Arms and Military Equipment]. 
  This is Shaposhnikov's fourth appointment in the last three 
years. In 1991 he replaced Dmitriy Yazov as USSR defense 
minister; in 1992 he was appointed commander in chief of the CIS 
Joint Armed Forces; and since 1993 he has held the post of 
Russian Federation Security Council secretary. It is noteworthy 
that each time, Marshal Shaposhnikov has resigned at his own 
will. 
  Rosvooruzheniye was created under the Russian Federation 
president's edict of 18 November 1993. The company's main tasks 
are investments in military industrial complex enterprises, the 
export and import of military equipment of all types, creation 
of maintenance facilities and personnel training centers abroad, 
and so forth. 
  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's correspondent asked Yevgeniy 
Shaposhnikov to answer a few questions. 
  [Zhilin] There has been controversial reaction to your 
appointment. Some think that the president has entrusted this 
responsible post to you as a man not tainted by corruption. 
Others suppose that they are thus trying either to "buy" or 
"sell you out." 
  [Shaposhnikov] How can I be bought? If I was a careerist, I 
would not have voluntarily resigned my previous high positions. 
I have received numerous proposals to work in political and 
commercial foundations and organizations. But to me, state 
interests have first priority. Therefore I gratefully accepted 
the president's proposal, which I regard as his trust in me. 
  [Zhilin] Incidentally, about the post. Do you not see it as 
somewhat artificial? There is Rosvooruzheniye's head, General 
Samoylov, who is overseen by the government. Why then is there 
a need for a presidential representative? 
  [Shaposhnikov] In all countries engaged in exporting 
military equipment and arms this sphere of state activity is 
supervised personally by the president because it is so 
important and, I would say, sensitive. In this sphere, 
absolutely objective information is needed. I am ready to 
provide such information to the president, no matter what. 
  [Zhilin] What specifically will be your duties? 
  [Shaposhnikov] Arms export is a substantial revenue source 
which may not be ignored, especially under difficult economic 
and financial conditions. Together with the top Rosvooruzheniye 
executive we shall analyze the proposed deals from the viewpoint 
of their usefulness and profitability for Russia. We are to get 
a clear understanding of the situation on the world market, and 
calmly come to agreement with our partners in arms trade about 
Russia's place on this market. In a word, there will be plenty 
of work. 
  I shall try to do everything possible to make sure that 
Russia is not accused of unfair arms trading practices and that 
all the revenues are returned to the state treasury, not end up 
in the Western bank accounts of some dubious commercial 
structures.

<F P=106> ["Own information" report: "Officer in Charge of Washbasins </F>
-- There Is No Such Post in the Russian Defense Ministry at the 
Moment. But If You Went to School With Pavel Grachev It Might 
Be Invented for You"] 
  [Text] Sources in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry 
report that increasingly serious irritation at the minister's 
personnel policy is brewing among officers and generals in the 
military department. Photocopies of the biographical details of 
generals in Pavel Grachev's immediate entourage who have moved 
up the promotion ladder unusually swiftly for the military have 
been circulated in Russian Federation Defense Ministry 
directorates and departments and the General Staff in the past 
few days. 
  These generals include Lieutenant General Valeriy Lapshov, 
leader of the defense minister's administration, who was an 
ordinary senior officer in the General Staff Main Operations 
Directorate until 1991. He once studied in the same group as 
Grachev at the General Staff Academy. In fall of 1991 Grachev, 
who was then Shaposhnikov's deputy, took him under his wing, 
making him first a major general, and later a lieutenant 
general. It is confirmed that only Deputy Minister Valeriy 
Mironov, who at that time supervised personnel questions, 
objected to Lapshov acquiring the rank of colonel general. (He 
is not supervising them any more.) Today Lapshov occupies one 
of the key posts in the Defense Ministry: He largely controls 
whether a particular document or person reaches the minister. 
Among the senior officers in the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry, Lapshov is known as a sociable man, an indispensable 
organizer of dinners for friends. It cannot be ruled out that 
this is precisely the reason why the equally sociable Pavel 
Grachev took a shine to him. 
  Major General Sergey Zdorikov, a career political worker 
recently appointed chief of the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry Directorate for Work With Personnel, was also a student 
in the same group as Grachev and Lapshov at the General Staff 
Academy. According to the recollections of his fellow students, 
he was renowned as an extremely undisciplined student and 
persistent truant. Now he is the head teacher in the Russian 
Army. 
  Dmitriy Kharchenko was also a student in the same group as 
Grachev, Lapshov, and Zdorikov. After the General Staff 
Academy, he was in command of a supernumerary [zashtatnyy] 
division near Nizhniy Novgorod for a short time, and then became 
chief of the General Staff International Treaty Directorate. He 
has neither a legal nor a diplomatic education, but he quickly 
obtained the post of lieutenant general and moved up to deputy 
chief of the General Staff, although it would appear that the 
post of chief of an ordinary General Staff directorate does not 
merit this promotion. The military department suspects that the 
explanation is quite simple: Kharchenko managed to become part 
of Grachev's family -- their children married. It is now 
planned that Kharchenko's directorate will be given main 
directorate status, and he himself will be awarded the rank of 
colonel general. 
  Gennadiy Ivanov also studied together with Grachev, Lapshov, 
Zdorikov, and Kharchenko at the General Staff Academy. Before 
studying at the academy, he headed a group at an 
operational-strategic research center, now abolished in view of 
the fact that it was completely useless. According to his 
classmates' opinions, he was no genius, but, following Grachev's 
appointment as defense minister, the latter took Colonel Ivanov 
under his wing -- and made him first chief of group and then 
chief of the Directorate for Military Organizational Development 
and Reform. This directorate was dubbed "Directorate for the 
Rising and Setting of the Sun" at the Defense Ministry. Within 
a short time Ivanov became lieutenant general and today is in 
charge of all questions connected with the reform of the Army. 
Everyone has the right to judge for themselves the results of 
his work. 
  Major General Vladimir Nikitin, chief of the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry Administrative Directorate, alas, 
did not go to school with Grachev, Lapshov, Zdorikov, 
Kharchenko, and Ivanov. Maybe that is why, having entered the 
Main Personnel Directorate as an ordinary civilian employee, he 
only reached the rank of major over a period of a number of 
years. However, the events of August 1991 were his hour of 
triumph -- after spending three days in the "White House," 
Nikitin was invited to join the State-Legal Administration under 
the Russian Federation president. There, within a year, he 
became a major general (although, as his fellow workers joke, 
before he received his general's shoulder boards, he had never 
been in command of any larger troop grouping than a couple of 
typists), and returned to the Defense Ministry to head the 
Administrative Directorate. 
  People in the Defense Ministry recall that after 
Shaposhnikov's unruly democracy, Grachev's arrival here was 
greeted with enthusiasm. And at first, relying on comrades from 
Afghanistan, from Gromov and Mironov to the late Dubynin, he 
really was able to establish some kind of order and restore the 
practically lost command and control of both the troops and the 
apparatus. However, in time, some of his former friends 
distanced themselves from the minister, some were moved aside, 
and the posts of the closest advisers were occupied by other, 
more convenient people. That, according to one high-ranking 
Defense Ministry staffer, is Pavel Grachev's tragedy. 
  ...The list of the defense minister's current entourage runs 
to more than one page. Reading the service records of the 
closest people, some people get exasperated and indignant, while 
others just laugh. However, in our opinion, it is more alarming 
that increasing numbers of professional servicemen, coming up 
against such cases, get fed up and leave the apparatus of the 
military department. The question "Whom are we serving?" is 
being asked behind the scenes increasingly frequently in the 
Defense Ministry and the General Staff. The technical elite -- 
the purchasing directorates of the Defense Ministry: the 
Defense Ministry Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate, the Main 
Armored Directorate, the GATU [expansion unknown], and the 12th 
Main Directorate, and the chemical troops... -- are being 
gradually left without work. The Army is being deprived of the 
most important thing -- military intellect, which, despite the 
not entirely groundless jokes of the man in the street, did 
nevertheless exist. What are we getting in return?

<F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>
  [Text] We are going to talk about Army problems. The point 
is that figures from secret Defense Ministry documents, 
published by the press in Moscow recently, have made us focus on 
all these issues again. 
  Let me recall some of these data: only 51 percent of the 
Armed Forces personnel and only one division in each military 
district are capable of waging combat operations. Only 20 
percent of tanks currently at the army's disposal can be 
regarded as combat-ready and there are only a few Navy warships 
that are capable of complying with the Navy regulations 
governing the procedure of putting a warship in a state of full 
combat readiness. 
  Replying to Mayak correspondent Yuriy Selivanov's questions, 
Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th 
Russian Army, deployed in the Dniester region, confirmed these 
depressing data in a short interview. 
  [Begin recording] [Selivanov] The first question for 
Aleksandr Ivanovich is connected with his appraisal of the 
current state of the Russian Armed Forces and the military 
reform under way in these forces. 
  [Lebed] The Army has been pushed up a blind alley, carved 
up, and had mud flung at it, and this was a lengthy and 
systematic process. At long last it is as though they saw the 
light, not completely, but, nevertheless, they did see the light 
and it is as though they started to be more receptive to the 
Army and its problems; pay was raised and some half-hearted 
attempts to build housing got off the ground. As for the 
breakup, they did it fast, but to restore all this and put 
things to rights, well, time is needed here. 
  [Selivanov] The second question: Independent states have 
existed on the former USSR's territory for two years and they 
have been setting up their own armies for two years. If at all 
possible, could you sum up the results of these military 
developments in the independent CIS states? 
  [Lebed] I would not like them to take offense at what I say, 
but this signifies the Army's collapse: They destroyed what did 
exist and proved incapable themselves of preserving what existed 
before, with all the shortcomings -- and shortcomings did exist, 
I am not saying they did not. They did not do anything 
positive, just put the finishing touches to the process of 
destruction and went about it with joy, as it were, getting rid 
of Russians, getting rid of all those who dared to think 
differently. This is a state of collapse -- there is no army. 
What does exist are these decrepit forces of these apanage 
principalities, equipped with rusty tanks and combat vehicles, 
weapons that are not ready to do battle and so on. Well, this 
is my view now. [end recording] 
  Despite this whole unpropitious climate that now prevails, 
Russia has gained almost as many generals as was the case in the 
entire and huge Soviet Union, in all its 15 republics. However, 
if today's article in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA is anything to go by, 
it is the Russian Ministry of Defense -- Minister Pavel Grachev 
and his retinue -- that need to be blamed here. Quite a few 
pages would be needed to list this retinue. 
  Reading the service records of the closest bigwigs, some 
people get indignant and angry, while others simply laugh 
loudly. However, an ever more serious irritation at the 
minister's personnel policy is coming to a head, if one takes 
the officer corps of the Ministry of Defense as a whole. 
Photocopies of biographies of generals from Pavel Grachev's 
entourage, generals who, as far as the army is concerned, 
climbed the service ladder unusually fast, have recently been 
circulated and are being circulated in the Russian Defense 
Ministry's and the General Staff's directorates and departments. 
However, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA says that what is really alarming 
is the fact that, having encountered instances such as these, 
more and more military professionals are beginning not to give a 
damn about anything and are leaving the Army altogether. 
  Thus, the Army is being deprived of the main thing -- the 
military intellect which, despite the not entirely unjustified 
jokes among the public, did, nevertheless, exist in it.

<F P=106> [By Igor Krondo; from the "Military Courier" program] </F>
  [Text] [Krondo] The first phase of Russia's motor vehicle 
championship has taken place in Moscow Oblast's Bronnitsy. For 
the first time in the history of motor vehicle sport there was a 
display of military motor vehicles and technical servicing 
facilities, mobile workshops, and heavy traction vehicles with 
which the Russian Army is being equipped. Alongside the 
well-known two-, three-, and four-axled Mustang-class KamAZ 
trucks which won prizes in the 1992 Paris-Dakar Rally, new 
vehicles were also on display. They included high all-terrain 
capability wheeled and tracked GAZ-47 and GAZ-47-04 vehicles 
designed to carry personnel and light arms. It is planned to 
equip the mobile forces which are currently being formed with 
these vehicles. 
  Heavy traction vehicles also demonstrated their 
capabilities. 
They can easily haul a tank or a strategic missile complex from 
a battlefield, or out of crater, ravine, or bog. The pride of 
our military motor vehicle industry is of course the Vityaz 
range of double-unit tracked vehicles with a loading capacity of 
10, 20, or 30 tonnes. Marshes, bogs, and quicksands are no 
threat to them. They easily cope with muddy roads in spring and 
fall and snowdrifts in winter, and are able to float across 
rivers and lakes. 
  [N.A. Zazulin, chief of the Russian Defense Ministry Main 
Motor Vehicle Directorate] I can claim with utmost confidence 
that the Vityaz, which comes in the 10-, 20-, and 30-tonne 
version, is unparalleled in the world. Swedes, Canadians, and 
others have shown great interest in this equipment. Honestly, 
these machines are unique.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The January 14 incident, 
which occurred when Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov on 
board Soyuz TM-17 spaceship flew over the Mir orbital station, 
was described by Serebrov in an ITAR-TASS interview on Thursday, 
as "normal" and the one which was to be expected. The spaceship 
"touched" the station because "methods for maneuvers had not 
been optimised on the ground". "Nothing would have happened if 
methods suggested by us were used", he said. 
  A special commission inquired into the incident. It has 
become known from reliable sources that a draft decision has 
already been prepared and will be signed in the coming days. 
  Serebrov believes that the blame for the incident is 
expected 
to be laid on the cosmonauts, whereas only one member of the 
commission met him to get first-hand information. 
  In the opinion of a number of experts, the psychological 
aspect should be also taken into account because Tsibliyev and 
Serebrov were due to return to the earth way back in November 
but had their space mission extended by almost two months (in 
all, they stayed in orbit for 197 days) owing to difficulties in 
the timely supply of booster rockets. It was literally at the 
last moment that the cosmonauts got an assignment to fly over 
the station and photograph it. 
  "The value the orbital complex has grown very much of late. 
Besides, it will be actively used to implement a Mir-Shuttle 
international programme. Therefore it is necessary to be very 
careful to rule out such incidents in the future," Viktor 
Legostayev, deputy chief designer of the Energia scientific and 
production amalgamation, told ITAR-TASS, emphasising that the 
station, which has been in orbit since 1986, is very reliable 
and withstood not only the contact but also a recent meteoric 
shower. 
  Nevertheless, Tsibliyev's and Serebrov's work in orbit was 
cited by space sector chiefs who attended a ceremonial meeting 
marking the cosmonauts' return to earth. The chiefs thanked the 
crew of the 14th main expeditlion for the succesful 
accomplishment of all research and experiements and 
congratulated them on being decorated with high state awards. 
  Tsibliyev will be 40 and Serebrov will be 50 later this 
month.

<F P=106> [Question and answer session with President Leonid Kravchuk </F>
by deputies, following speech on nuclear issues at the Supreme 
Council session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] [Dorohuntsov] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I know 
that you signed the statement and an appendix to this statement, 
which is not very simple and is not very easy for Ukraine. I 
believe that you were forced to do so. That was a political 
decision which will have very important consequences for 
Ukraine, and you have probably assessed these consequences. I 
support your stand and I will vote in its favor. Unfortunately, 
I believe that we do not have an alternative. 
  However, I have the following question for you. As is known, 
our disarmament -- the technical details are up to specialists 
and we are not specialists -- requires significant expenditures. 
What will Ukraine's share -- if there is no possibility to 
express it in absolute figures -- of these expenditures be, and 
what will the share of the so-called world community be? This 
is a very serious question for us. I think here we could do our 
best to take as much as possible; unfortunately, it is not us 
who make these decisions unilaterally. So, I would only like 
you to express your opinion on this matter. In addition, it 
would possibly be good if this brief discussion of ours is 
broadcast in full. Thanks for your reply. 
  [Kravchuk] True, when a resolution is being adopted in this 
hall, or some law, we try to write down in it our maximum needs 
and our maximum benefits, and this can be understood. And when 
the law or some resolution is implemented, and when more than 
one country -- and here three or four countries are involved -- 
compromises are inevitable, otherwise one would never adopt 
anything. Not to adopt a decision at a time when there is a 
Supreme Council resolution and to drive this problem into a 
blind corner would mean extremely grave consequences and a 
threat to the security of Ukraine, and not only Ukraine. 
  I underscore that I was guided by the reservations, which is 
the main thing. Second, in order for you to understand, I was 
guided not by the pressure which was applied and which always 
exists, but by the realities facing Ukraine. And the realities, 
which I have already told you about, are these: Today Ukraine 
cannot safely maintain and service the nuclear weapons which we 
inherited. These weapons are becoming obsolete and pose a 
threat to us. If one fails to understand this, the rest is 
derivative. If we act appropriately, others will adopt an 
appropriate attitude toward us. As far as specific expenditures 
are concerned, relevant calculations are already available. 
Both the United States and the European community already say 
that the financial aid figures for dismantling the nuclear 
weapons will be doubled. 
  Second [as heard], the warheads will be dismantled in 
Russia, 
and Ukraine will be compensated for them according to world 
prices, less the expenditure for their dismantling. 
  The next steps connected with silos and launcher vehicles 
will be agreed upon on the basis of other agreements to be 
worked out on the basis of the resolution. This is because 
there are problems here. We cannot blow up the silos because 
they are located in densely populated areas. However, these 
issues will be stipulated in other agreements. Today the talk 
is about the fundamental decisions and about those fundamental 
decisions which the Supreme Council reservations dealt with, and 
we are trying to implement them. 
  [Yakheyeva] Tetyana Yakheyeva, Electoral District No. 438. 
First, I have a procedural comment to make on the president's 
legislative initiative. This probably relates to the lawyers 
that he consulted. Leonid Makarovych said that he submitted to 
the Supreme Council a draft resolution on the accession of 
Ukraine to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The treaty 
itself, however, was not submitted to the Supreme Council. I 
would like everyone to know about this. This is like adopting a 
resolution bringing a law into effect, with the law itself 
having not been under consideration. 
  Second, esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I have several very 
short 
questions. The following situation has arisen on the issue of 
nuclear weapons: Our executive power is governed exclusively by 
statements and declarations, being purely political documents, 
and pays no heed whatsoever to resolutions and laws adopted in 
Ukraine, or to its military doctrine or foreign policy. This is 
why I have this question to you: Do you think the implementation 
of this trilateral statement is obligatory for executive power? 
  The second question is this: What agreements were concluded 
during the negotiations on the fulfillment of the reservations? 
For example, was any agreement concluded on the civilian use of 
silo launchers, compensation, or anything else? Was it or was 
it not? 
  Finally, the last question: According to the foreign media, 
which writes in the words of members of the American delegation, 
some secret accords were reached during these negotiations, the 
contents of which will forever remain unknown to anyone. Were 
such accords reached or is it untrue? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] I would like to start at the end. A package of 
all the documents which were signed was published. Other 
protocol records related to purely technical matters rather 
than, shall we say, any issues of principle, because it is about 
elimination, withdrawal, their procedure, character, the 
timetable, and so on, and not about political documents, which 
would be of an obligatory nature and which were published in the 
press. In other words, what you are probably referring to is 
these protocol records. I cannot say anything else, I have not 
read it, so unfortunately I do not know what the press writes 
about. 
  Is the statement of an obligatory nature? The statement is 
of an obligatory nature in that we now -- except, shall we say, 
that we, on the basis of existing reservations and of the 
Supreme Council's resolution -- can act accordingly, having 
implemented these reservations with regard to 36 and 42 percent 
of the missiles subject to elimination and reduction. We can 
act right now. So in this sense it is of an obligatory nature, 
because it corresponds with the Supreme Council's resolutions. 
It does correspond with it. 
  As for what you are saying about other agreements, I have 
already said that these issues are settled after decisions of 
principle are made. Then the issues of specific agreements, 
specific issues, are settled. They by all means will be made at 
governmental and inter-governmental level after being worked on 
by experts. This is a whole number of documents rather than one 
document.

<F P=106> ["Concluding" address by President Leonid Kravchuk at the </F>
Supreme Council session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] To begin with, I shall answer some of the comments 
made and questions asked here. First of all, about a legally 
binding document on compensation to Ukraine for nuclear weapons. 
As for strategic nuclear weapons, such a document was signed 
with Russia and it is legally binding. It was signed by the 
Russian and Ukrainian premiers, [Viktor] Chernomyrdin and the 
then Ukrainian prime minister Leonid Kuchma. As for 
compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, by all means there 
will be this compensation. As early as this month experts will 
begin to work on determining the value of these weapons. They 
are experts from Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. Thus, 
on the main issue on the agenda here, that is, on compensation 
for nuclear weapons to Ukraine, one part of it was legally 
settled and the other will be settled after the evaluation of 
these nuclear weapons. 
  This, I tell you, is what it is in reality. There is an 
absolutely specific accord on the part of Ukraine: Should one of 
the sides fail to fulfill its obligations, Ukraine for its part 
will stop actions. 
  Next, there is no agreement -- and I do not know where what 
was said here comes from -- on the destruction of missiles, 
including SS-24's. There is no such a thing, I emphasize this. 
What it is about is lowering the combat status of missiles, not 
destroying SS-24's. This is quite another matter. It is about 
lowering their combat status. As for withdrawing them, we will 
determine what warheads will be withdrawn and not the 
destruction of missiles, as was said here. Not a single 
document mentions this. Why distort facts? This is a question 
of principle. 
  I emphasize -- please do not interrupt me -- it is 
specifically about lowering their combat status and withdrawing 
200 warheads within 10 months, without specifying what warheads 
and from what missiles. 
  Next, I have nowhere and never said that I will withdraw 
nuclear warheads independently from the Supreme Council 
decision. I address this reply to Mr. Hudyma. The talk was 
about the following: When the nuclear warhead becomes physically 
obsolete and when Ukraine faces danger, then irrespective of the 
decision, whether taken by the president or the Supreme Council 
-- and the defense minister was saying about this, by the way, 
people will not say this is not true -- then the nuclear 
warheads will have to be withdrawn. Because there will be a 
dilemma: Either danger or nuclear warheads. I have said this 
and I am saying this to you. As for everything else, the 
president's actions will be adequate to the Supreme Council 
decision. 
  Another question arises. I want to tell you about this 
sincerely. If we withdraw the warheads according to an 
agreement, this is an appropriate legal document and a process 
of compensation. If we withdraw in the face of danger, then the 
question will be put in a different manner by those who accept 
the warheads. It is not by chance that I read the message from 
the chief designer, or, a group of chief designers. This is a 
question of principle and one must take it into account. 
  I can fully support those deputies who are saying that not 
everything has been done neatly over this time, both on the part 
of the president and on the part of the government, that we have 
made many mistakes and that it is really true that we have been 
put in complicated economic, political, and international 
situations and that these situations require appropriate 
actions. And if someone has other possibilities for such 
actions, then let him offer them. I have been acting in line 
with the decisions of the Supreme Council and I was striving to 
achieve the fulfillment of those decisions. 
  One more thing: Not a single country can ever claim that all 
agreements should be concluded with it in advance, before it 
determines its final status. We have to determine our status. 
If we are a nonnuclear state, then we have to exercise this 
status consistently. And after that the agreements are 
concluded -- both the defense minister and Vasyl Vasyloyvych 
Durdynets [deputy chairman of the Supreme Council] have partly 
enumerated those agreements which are envisioned for signing: On 
the value of compensation, on silos, on withdrawal, on schedules 
-- everything will be done without fail. Not a single move can 
be made without such agreements because it would be dangerous to 
make such moves and nobody would do this. 
  I understand that today it is difficult to make decisions, 
there are political problems, there is pressure applied on 
Ukraine. They are right who say that Russia should abandon its 
claims to Ukraine. But these claims were made by that Supreme 
Soviet which no longer exists. There is another Supreme Soviet. 
Now that country must determine itself and I support those who 
raise this question, but you must understand that there are 
relevant procedures and a relevant order. I cannot force the 
Duma or the Federal Assembly of Russia to cancel these 
reservations, as far as the former Supreme Soviet is concerned. 
Russia itself will determine whether or not these are legal. 
And, in the long run, this is the legal and constitutional 
right of the Duma and the Federal Assembly. We can only propose 
that such steps should be taken. 
  We are facing economic problems which must be solved. And if 
we stop or block, as People's Deputy Haysynskyy said, this 
process in the presence of all those economic difficulties and 
absence of possibilities to act, both in relation to power 
engineering, nuclear power stations, and fuel elements, then we 
will have to face the dilemma: Either one or the other. 
  I would like to assure you, esteemed people's deputies, 
that Ukraine will be compensated for both tactical and strategic 
nuclear weapons. I would like to tell you that today, at 
lunchtime, I received a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
in which he gave his consent to double economic aid to Ukraine 
-- specific figures, serious figures are mentioned, to provide 
assistance in eliminating nuclear weapons and to provide aid to 
those officers who need social protection, including housing. 
  As a matter of fact, I was acting in a situation which took 
shape, I was acting so as not to do harm to Ukraine, so as to 
preserve the state. Maybe, someone else can do it better. Now 
it is up to the Supreme Council. I would only like to say that 
we must take steps consistently. And this consistency was 
initiated by the Supreme Council and I believe that this Supreme 
Council must also say its final word, to finish what it once 
began. 
  Thank you for your attention.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet today ratified the 
START-I treaty leaving out all stipulations regarding guarantees 
of the republic's security that it introduced during the 
consideration of the issue on November 18, 1993. A resolution 
made today instructs the government to carry out the exchange of 
ratification letters to the treaty. 
  The stipulations related to guarantees of Ukraine's 
territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and protection 
from aggression by nuclear states as well as compensations for 
Ukrainian nuclear warheads withdrawn from the republic. 
  At present, the stipulations are lifted since the deputies 
believe that Kiev's conditions have been met. 
  The resolution was passed by a majority of 260 votes, with 3 
votes against. Five deputies abstained and 21 failed to take 
part in the voting. 
  The parliament also decided to join the Lisbon protocol to 
the START-I treaty, including article 5. According to the 
article, Ukraine will join the nonproliferation treaty as a 
non-nuclear state in the near future. However, the parliament 
rejected the proposal to immediately join the treaty. 
  A total of 193 deputies voted for joining the treaty, 27 
against. Eleven deputies abstained and 58 failed to take part in 
the voting. 
  Speaking before the session, Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said that the republic will necessarily receive the 
compensation for the nuclear weapons destroyed. He said 
Ukrainian, Russian and American experts will start work on 
determining the size of the compensation in February. 
  "If only one of the sides fails to fulfil its obligations, 
Ukraine will suspend the activities on its part," Kravchuk said, 
meaning the withdrawal of warheads of strategic nuclear missiles.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Kiev UNIAR in Ukrainian at 1730 GMT on 3 
February carries a 350-word Ukraine Supreme Council resolution 
on the START I Treaty as follows: 
  "The Supreme Council of Ukraine has resolved: 
  "1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the 
president and Government of Ukraine regarding the implementation 
of the provisions of the Supreme Council resolution dated 18 
November 1993, and the steps to meet Ukraine half-way on the 
part of the United States and Russia, in order to remove the 
reservations regarding the article of the Protocol to the START 
Treaty signed in Lisbon on 23 May 1992. 
  "2. To charge the Government of Ukraine with carrying out 
the exchange of instruments of ratification of the START Treaty. 
  "3. To accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty dated 
1 July 1968, which will hereafter be termed the Treaty, as a 
state not owning nuclear weapons, with the following statement: 
  "1) Ukraine owns the components of the nuclear weapons that 
it inherited from the former USSR, and after the weapons have 
been dismantled and destroyed under its control, and in 
accordance with procedures that will rule out the possibility of 
reusing these weapons' components for the original purpose, 
Ukraine intends to use the material extracted from them 
exclusively for civilian purposes, in particular as fuel for 
Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric power station], or receive 
compensation for them; 
  "2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] does not 
fully 
cover the unique situation that arose as a result of the 
disintegration of the USSR as a nuclear state. The presence of 
nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine until they are 
eliminated entirely, as well as appropriate activity to 
maintain, service, and eliminate them, does not contravene the 
provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty. 
  "3) Ukraine will hold talks with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency with the aim of concluding agreements regarding 
the guarantees envisaged by the Treaty. 
  "4) The violation of the territorial integrity or 
inviolability of Ukraine's borders on the part of any nuclear 
state will be viewed by Ukraine as a violation of the Treaty." 
  Kiev UNIAR in Ukrainian at 1900 GMT on 3 February then 
carried the following service message: 
  "The news agency RESPUBLIKA [UNIAR] apologizes for the 
incorrect information about the approval by the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council of the resolution on the fulfillment by 
Ukraine's president of the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
recommendations made during the ratification of the START I 
Treaty. The Supreme Council approved a resolution of two items: 
  "1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the 
president and Government of Ukraine regarding the implementation 
of the provisions of the Supreme Council resolution dated 18 
November 1993, and the steps to meet Ukraine half-way on the 
part of the United States and Russia, in order to remove the 
reservations regarding article of the Protocol to the START 
Treaty signed in Lisbon on 23 May 1992. 
  "2. To charge the Government of Ukraine with carrying out 
the exchange of instruments of ratification of the START Treaty. 
With this aim to step up the activity of the Government on 
concluding specific international agreements stemming from the 
reservations of the Supreme Council resolution on the 
ratification of the START I Treaty. 
  "Item 3 on Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty was excluded from the resolution due to 
the fact that it was not discussed in Parliament. Deputy Sergey 
Golovatyy made a remark to the effect that Ukraine could not 
announce itself simultaneously a nuclear state while acceding to 
START I and a non-nuclear state while participating in the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Issues of compensation for 
the nuclear weapon components were touched upon with regard to 
the difference in prices for the fuel uranium on the U.S. 
internal and external market, etc. Deputies Sergey Golovatyy, 
Tetyana Yakheyeva, and Sergey Semenets proposed to discuss this 
in the standing commissions, and to then submit it for the 
consideration of the Supreme Council. After this the issue on 
accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will be 
solved."

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov by </F>
Olena Lisychna; place and date not given: "Ukraine's Last 
Nuclear Season"] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who headed 
Ukraine's delegation to negotiations in Washington on the eve of 
the Moscow meeting, has indeed become a hero of Ukraine's last 
"nuclear" season. 
  For a while, the legislature has put aside discussion of the 
"nuclear" agreement. If the Supreme Council does not support 
the Moscow agreement, Ukraine will experience "hard days," 
claims Valeriy Shamarov. At the same time, Valeriy Shamarov 
does not support illusions that Ukraine will receive weighty 
credits and investments. However, he believes that even "small 
sums are better than nothing." 
  [Lisychna] This "nuclear" history still has many white 
spots, 
and the issue of compensation for our tactical nuclear weapons 
is of extreme interest. 
  [Shmarov] Indeed, for quite a long time, Russia did not 
agree 
to our demands for compensation. However, at the last stage of 
the negotiations, Russia recognized our ownership of the 
tactical nuclear weapons and we discussed, in general, forms of 
holding our mutual accounts. We will cancel part of our debts 
for energy resources by transferring these tactical nuclear 
weapons to Russia. In the first place, in my opinion, this is 
better than nothing. In the second place, Ukraine cannot enjoy 
equal partnership because it has amassed enormous debts to 
Russia. 
  [Lisychna] Valeriy Mykolayovych, what part of our debt could 
be canceled? 
  [Shmarov] The more the better. I estimate our 1993 debts to 
Russia at $1 billion, while 1992 debts -- at $2.5 billion. In 
my opinion, we could settle 50 percent of our 1993 debts. 
  Well, the issue of strategic nuclear weapons is also very 
complicated. Economic calculations were based on data drawn 
from the worldwide uranium trade. The U.S. side will be a 
guarantor of the fulfillment of this agreement by the Russian 
party. A tripartite commission will draft the contract on this 
agreement in three-months time. 
  [Lisychna] Who will pay for the processing of uranium in 
Russia? 
  [Shmarov] This expense is included in the costs of Ukrainian 
deliveries to Russia. One more positive moment for Russia: 
Russia will be paid by the United States for each weapon 
dismantled on the territory of Ukraine. 
  [Lisychna] Is this payment for work or a kind of moral 
support? 
  [Shmarov] This moral support means big money. In general, 
the United States is deeply interested in the dismantlement of 
nuclear weapons because the missiles are still directed at the 
United States, despite the fact that the button is in Moscow. 
  [Lisychna] For how long can our nuclear power plants work on 
the fuel which we are going to receive from Russia as part of 
our compensation? 
  [Shmarov] Yearly, we require 100 tonnes of nuclear fuel. 
Currently, we are short of nuclear fuel. Our nuclear power 
plants could work for five to seven years on the fuel which will 
be delivered under the Moscow agreement. 
  [Lisychna] Our legislature must adopt the START I and START 
II Treaties and Ukraine should sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty before the Moscow agreements can start being 
implemented.... 
  [Shmarov] If these agreements are not implemented, Ukraine 
will experience hard times. We have held a series of 
consultations in the Supreme Council. The deputies understand 
the importance of these agreements. In addition, after the 
Supreme Council says "yes" or "no," we will have to draft nine 
agreements on compensation issues. I hope that the Supreme 
Council's decision on the issue will be positive. 
  [Lisychna] On 25 January, IZVESTIYA published this report: 
"The second Chernobyl is under way. The dismantlement of old 
missiles in Ukraine has been stopped for an indefinite period 
due to the lack of military storage bases, transport, and 
material assets." Is this report true? 
  [Shmarov] These facts are partially true. Currently, we lack 
containers and means of transport. However, the Moscow 
agreements foresee that Russia will provide us with equipment 
and means of transportation.... The Russian Defense Ministry 
will deliver everything on time.... In general, our agreement 
with Russia is based on mutual relations: We also deal with 
servicing of nuclear- armed SS-24 rocket launchers in Russia 
because they were produced in Ukraine. 
  [Lisychna] Valeriy Mykolayovych, what about the sum of $2.8 
billion? In late 1993, Ukraine demanded that this sum be 
earmarked for the dismantlement of its nuclear weapons. 
However, it turned out that this figure was also false. So, 
what sum does Ukraine currently require? 
  [Shmarov] The figure of $2.8 billion is likely to be too 
big. 
In my opinion, we require more than $175 million or even $1.75 
billion. Well, concerning the so-called U.S. financial aid, I 
insisted (even during my stay in Washington) that the United 
States should increase its aid within the framework of the 
Nunn-Lugar program. The U.S. side has promised this. It is 
more important for us to not receive consultations (we have our 
own experts) or a system of satellite communications, but modern 
equipment, diesel fuel, assets for social protection of 
servicemen, etc.... Or, simply put, our requirements are more 
practical. 
  [Lisychna] Bill Clinton said at the Boryspil airport that 
Ukraine can use funds from the Nunn-Lugar program for purposes 
of conversion and defense.... 
  [Shmarov] These means are miserable. As for conversion, we 
have signed an agreement between the Pentagon and the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Machine Building on the issue of cooperation in the 
sphere of conversion. This could be one more source of 
financial resources because we could draft projects in which 
Americans could become interested. 
  One more positive element of the Moscow agreement is the 
extension of our relations. Currently, our government 
delegation is working in the United States. Our economic 
cooperation with the United States currently stands at $500 
million. 
  [Lisychna] Valeriy Mykolayovych, how can you predict that 
investments and credits will flow to a denuclearized Ukraine? 
Our economic reforms are at a standstill. 
  [Shmarov] This is a difficult question. U.S. business 
circles are dissatisfied with the course of reforms in Ukraine. 
However, they consider our issue of denuclearization to be of 
key importance, and the issue of economic reforms is of 
secondary interest to them. 
  In my opinion, the United States will not force us with the 
implementation of these reforms. Though, some people think this 
way.

<F P=106> [Taras Petriv report: "No War and No Peace, Just Human </F>
Suffering"] 
  [Text] No war and no peace, just human suffering. This is 
how Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Zlenko described 
the present situation in the region of the Bosnian conflict 
after a visit to the Ukrainian battalion within the UN 
peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo. Our state must decide what 
else it may do to help heal this bleeding wound in Europe. 
  UN representatives have repeatedly commended Ukraine's 
contribution to the peacekeeping process. The fact that the UN 
Security Council turned to our state with a request to add 
another 800 personnel to the battalion is proof of the prestige 
gained by the Ukrainian servicemen. At the same time, despite 
the considerable contingent of soldiers, Kiev does not have 
observers there. The number of officers is also small. This 
restricts any more extensive participation of Ukrainian 
representatives in untying the Balkan knot. The military 
contingent's main tasks in the region of conflict amount to 
accompanying humanitarian aid convoys to the civilian 
population, repairing electricity and water-supply networks, and 
holding, on special orders, operations to disarm the warring 
sides and demilitarizing the areas. During a meeting with 
Zlenko, commander of the joint troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina M. 
Rose praised the activities of the Ukrainian servicemen. 
(Incidentally, in view of the severe shortage of food in the 
city, our soldiers share their food rations with Sarajevo 
children, and the battalion has even adopted several orphan 
children.) During the talks in Sarajevo, the head of the 
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stressed that a mutually acceptable 
variant for resolving problems in the region is only possible if 
all the possibilities and interests of the sides are taken into 
account. 
  As well as Sarajevo, Zlenko also visited Croatia and 
Slovenia. For a number of reasons, the visit there had been 
delayed for a long time. That is why members of the Ukrainian 
delegation tried somehow to stress their interest in the 
development of relations with Zagreb and Ljubljana and held 
extensive consultations to find realistic ways to intensify ties 
with those countries, particularly in the economic sphere. A 
legal foundation was also laid in Zagreb for expanding contacts: 
Agreements on cooperation between the foreign ministries of the 
two countries and on consular ties were signed. A document on 
cooperation between the foreign ministries was also signed in 
the Slovenian capital. At the summing-up news conference in 
Zagreb, Croatian Foreign Minister M. Granic stated that a 
bilateral trade agreement, which will definitely be signed 
during his visit to Kiev, will promote economic ties. In his 
opinion, political relations between Ukraine and Croatia are 
much better developed than economic ties. It is, however, clear 
that every country must now pay much attention to its own 
domestic problems. An agreement on friendship and cooperation, 
which has been prepared, will be yet another step toward broad 
cooperation between Kiev and Zagreb. In Granic's opinion, 
Ukraine might have a positive influence on resolving the Balkan 
crisis and, in this context, on the position of the Serbs. He 
pointed out that the declaration on the settlement of the 
relations between Croats and Serbs is the first step toward 
normalization, but that this process depends on Serbia. The 
main problem is the restoration of normal life in reintegrated 
territories. Zlenko, in turn, stated that, on many issues, the 
positions of Ukraine and Croatia are very close or fully 
coincide. The Croatian position became clearer after the 
negotiations in Zagreb. 
  Observers reacted with surprise to Kiev's activity in the 
Balkan region, but they pointed out that its rapprochement with 
Zagreb and Ljubljana is understandable: There is a common 
desire to cooperate, and they are all, while respecting the 
aspirations of others, pursuing their own interests. Therefore, 
Ukraine will certainly respond positively to the Croatian side's 
request to help in settling the Balkan crisis and in normalizing 
relations between the Croats and the Serbs, but it will not 
diverge from its principles of balanced deportment. In its 
contacts with Slovenia, Kiev should have long passed from words 
to specific deeds, since that country presents a great interest 
for us, first and foremost, in the economic sphere. Ljubljana 
is also striving to establish close cooperation with Kiev. In 
particular, at the proposal of Slovenian Minister of Foreign 
Affairs L. Peterle, entrepreneurs from the two countries will 
hold a business conference in Ljubljana. In addition to that, 
Ukraine hopes that its Balkan partners with help in putting into 
effect its plans for joining the Central European Initiative. 
  However, Kiev, while trying hard to stress its desire to 
intensify relations with Croatia and Slovenia, is unable to open 
its embassies in those states. Perhaps, because of this 
situation, the relations between our countries have been 
deadlocked. I would like to hope that the earthquake that 
rocked Zagreb during the first day of Zlenko's official visit 
will shake off the dust from these relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] What ways to alleviate the Yugoslav 
crisis does Ukraine believe to be the most promising and 
realistic? 
  [Zlenko] As is known, the world community has drawn a number 
of variants of peaceful regulation of the armed conflict on the 
territory of former Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, attempts to 
resolve this problem on the basis of the well-known Owen-Vance 
plan fell short of the aim. Disregarding consent of the leaders 
of all the three ethnic minorities [as heard], their parliaments 
failed to ratify the achieved agreements and the status quo was 
preserved. The new French-German initiative suggested by Foreign 
Ministers Kinkel and Juppe is currently being discussed by the 
conflicting parties at the Geneva peace talks. The plan 
stipulates the creation of three ethnic formations on the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and establishing borders along 
ethnic lines or boundaries. In our opinion, this peaceful 
regulation plan is promising with regard to putting an end to 
armed opposition. Whether the plan will be implemented depends 
on the goodwill of the parties in the conflict. There are 
different approaches, even absolutely opposing ones on the part 
of the groups involved in the conflict. However, I believe that 
this plan corresponds more with the realities that have 
developed recently on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Reporter] [passage omitted] Can the economic sanctions 
imposed by the United Nations help to resolve the Yugoslav 
conflict any quicker? 
  [Zlenko] When did the world community suggest these 
sanctions? It was toward the end of 1991, when Serbian troops 
were waging a war against newly independent states. By now, the 
situation has significantly changed and I discussed this issue 
with the Hungarian foreign minister, who had returned from talks 
with the Belgrade leadership. We touched upon Belgrade's 
viewpoint on this issue as well as the issue of suspending 
sanctions. I want to say that the Hungarian foreign minister 
informed me in detail on the dramatic situation in which the 
people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia found themselves 
after the sanctions were imposed. In the first place, sanctions 
afflicted children and the elderly, causing shortages of food 
and medicine. I think that the situation currently developing 
in Serbia and Montenegro is terrible, and that the sanctions 
must not be preserved. They not only inflict heavy damage on 
the people of that state, but also on other states which found 
themselves within the range of these sanctions. I want to point 
out that from the military point of view the situation has 
changed. The suspension of sanctions imposed by the United 
Nations is currently being discussed. I would not like anybody 
to get the impression from what I have just said that Ukraine is 
ready to abolish the sanctions or abstain from using them. Of 
course, we are ready to do the world community's will, but at 
the same time we cannot disregard Ukraine's current situation. 
We know very well that we have been suffering heavy economic 
losses. We have almost lost our Danube commercial routes; our 
financial losses have exceeded $4 billion, according to 
preliminary calculations. I think that this urges us to resolve 
this problem. I would like to point out that at the same time, 
Ukraine is raising the issue of UN compensation for these 
financial losses, in accordance with Article 50 of the UN 
Charter. It was at our initiative that a UN session adopted an 
appropriate resolution in 1993, envisioning compensation for 
those losses. Thus, I want to underline that we must look 
realistically at the way the sanctions are observed and proceed 
from the postulate that further use of such harsh sanctions 
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia may bring about 
unforeseen or even tragic consequences. We would like to avoid 
this. Thus, I believe that we must think seriously about the 
way the sanctions afflict children and elderly people. We may 
be considering some gradual, stage-by-stage alleviation of the 
sanctions.

  [Text] The operation for the release of the hostages taken 
by a terrorist in Sukhodolsk on Thursday (formerly Krasnodon, 
the Ukrainian region of Lugansk) has practically come to an end 
in the airport in Rostov-on-Don. Well-informed sources told 
INTERFAX that the terrorist, who called himself Nikolay 
Skvortsov, was seized. 
  He had kept two boys, ages 3 and 4, and their 28-year-old 
nursery school teacher, Natalia Khitalenko, as hostages. 
  The terrorist, who had also captured a YAZ car with a 
driver, 
demanded on Thursday morning that $500,000 and a plane to go 
abroad be given to him. 
  He went from Sukhodolsk to Rostov-on-Don together with the 
hostages. Authorities there agreed to give him a Tu-134 
aircraft. 
  Initially, he declared that negotiations would begin as soon 
as he boarded the plane. He also demanded that he and the 
hostages board the plane before the crew. Two crews had 
volunteered to pilot the plane. 
  According to some sources, the terrorist intended to leave 
for London. Other information says he was going to the U.S.A.

Foreign Ministry] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry press center issued a 
declaration saying that the Romanian mass media have recently 
intensified their dissemination of disinformation on Ukraine, 
often citing officials of that country. Those reports and 
declarations are an attempt to mislead the international 
community and distract its attention from internal problems 
currently facing Romanian society. The Foreign Ministry of 
Ukraine, the press center declaration said, reserves the right 
to react to these kinds of reports in a proper way.

<F P=106> [Report by Oles Buzyna: "Henceforth, Ukraine and Poland Are </F>
Allies"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian and Polish ministers of environmental 
protection signed an agreement in Warsaw on cooperation in 
controlling shipments of hazardous waste. Poland faced this 
problem a couple of years before Ukraine. Its lengthy border 
with Germany -- the world's largest manufacturer of these 
"products" -- facilitated the immoral activities of companies 
involved in selling toxic waste. However, the Polish side 
adopted a strict law on shipping waste across the border. 
According to Greenpeace Ukraine, this is one of the best laws 
of its kind in the world. 
  Ukraine still has no legal footing for controlling this 
sector. A resolution adopted by the Supreme Soviet in November 
1993 was not implemented because the Council of Ministers has 
been lingering in compiling the list of toxic substances. The 
problem of German waste shipped to Rivne, Nikolayev, and Ochakov 
has not been resolved, regardless of the investigation conducted 
by competent organs and negotiations with Germany on returning 
the waste "to its native land." 
  The treaty with Poland is important for Ukraine first of 
all, 
because it includes a clause on prevention of transit of 
hazardous waste via the two states' territories. Thus, our 
ecological border has moved farther to the west.

  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- Newly elected Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov said his first step will be the 
restoration of a close economic union with Russia and that he 
always considered the people of the peninsula to be a part of 
the Russian people. 
  "My first step will be the creation of an authoritative 
delegation which would go to Moscow to conclude a close economic 
and cultural union with Russia", he said in an interview with 
the business "VEK" (CENTURY) newspaper on Friday. 
  The Crimea was handed over to Ukraine by former Soviet 
communist leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954, but Meshkov believes 
the people of the peninsula remained a part of the Russian 
people. 
  "As far as the Russian people are concerned -- I believe 
that 
before and after 1954 the people of the Crimea were a part of 
the Russian people. I hope the restoration of unity, 
unification is an issue of the near future", he stressed. 
  Meshkov who was inaugurated on Friday insists that the 
Crimea 
should hold a referendum on independence despite the ban of 
Ukrainian authorities. 
  "The acting ban of Kiev on holding the referendum has no 
grounds", he said adding that enough signatures had been 
collected in the Crimea in favour of holding the plebiscite. 
  "The talk is about the right of the Crimea to independently 
determine the contents and forms of its relations with 
neighbouring states", Meshkov said. 
  The president also said that the Black Sea Fleet which is 
disputed between Russia and Ukraine should not be split and 
should remain Russian. However, he added that the fleet should 
help create the Ukrainian Navy.

  [Text] Kiev -- A plenary session of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine took place on 3 February, at the beginning of which a 
law "On the Formation of Local Bodies of Power and 
Self-Government" was adopted. The law envisages in particular 
the division of power into bodies of local self-government and 
bodies of state power. The chairmen of oblast, rayon, town, 
settlement and village councils are directly elected by the 
populace, and in accordance with their post they head the 
executive committees of the relevant councils and have dual 
subordination. The chairmen of councils and the executive 
bodies they head are accountable to and under the control of the 
relevant councils, but on issues of carrying out the authorities 
of state executive power delegated to them they are subordinate 
to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The last article of the 
law envisages that after elections of deputies and chairmen of 
councils and the formation of executive bodies, the law of 
Ukraine "On the Representative of the President of Ukraine" will 
become invalid. A separate resolution envisages that elections 
of deputies to village and oblast councils and their chairmen 
will be conducted at the same time as the election of the 
president of Ukraine on 26 June 1994. 
  According to Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council, 
the issue of amendments and additions to the law on elections of 
people's deputies of Ukraine was put to the vote for the seventh 
time on 3 February. But this time the voting did not yield 
positive results. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 23 (513)] </F>
  [Text] A draft constitutional law on power which was 
considered by the Ukrainian parliament on Thursday morning 
attributes more representative functions to the post of the 
president. 
  As a member of the parliamentary commission on legislature 
and law Sergey Sobolev told the news agency Interfax-Ukraine, 
"the president becomes the head of state and represents Ukraine 
in international affairs, signs international treaties, and is 
entitled to cancel decisions of the Cabinet and implement a 
number of other duties." 
  The supreme body of the executive power in the republic is 
the Cabinet, which is confirmed by the parliament. As a result, 
Sobolev said, "Ukraine actually becomes a parliamentary 
republic." 
  The draft law on power also envisages that all authorities 
in 
regions are transferred to chairmen of local executive bodies, 
which should be elected popularly. The institution of 
presidential representatives in this case is eliminated. 
  Speaking at a session of the Supreme Soviet the day before, 
its Chairman, Ivan Plyushch, spoke against holding a referendum 
on basic constitutional provisions about power in Ukraine on 
March 27. Earlier, this proposal was made by President Leonid 
Kravchuk. 
  Plyushch believes that amendments to the organization of 
state power in Ukraine "should be made not through a referendum, 
but through the adoption of a constitutional law."

According to the law, after the elections, which will be held on 
June 26 simultaneously with presidential elections, the 
Ukrainian law on presidential representatives will become 
ineffective. 
  Under the law, chairmen of local councils of people's 
deputies are elected by the population of a region and become 
heads of executive committees of the corresponding councils. 
They are subordinate to the corresponding local councils. 
  In issues related to authorities of the state and executive 
powers, local councils are subordinate to the Cabinet and 
executive bodies of superior councils.

  [Text] Ukrainian nationalists from the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian 
National Assembly-Ukrainian Self-Defense] said that "on 12 
January Ukrainian citizen Kravchuk met with U.S. citizen Clinton 
at Borispol airport," as a result of which a crime was 
committed, namely: "espionage, the disclosure of a state secret, 
high treason." Upon the UNA-UNSO's coming to power in Ukraine, 
Kravchuk will not just be held politically responsible for that, 
but he will be prosecuted as a criminal. The UNA-UNSO leaders 
also said that the Crimean elections were a result of a 
conspiracy by the Jews, who have always dreamed about autonomy 
in Crimea. In the nationalists' view, Israeli influence in 
Crimea will increase. (RATUSHA) [as published]

  [Text] Myechyslaw Hryb, the new Supreme Soviet chairman, 
has started forming his team of advisers. 
  After a talk with his predecessor's foreign policy adviser, 
Valery Tsepkalo, the latter was told to resign. Tsepkalo 
himself told Interfax that his tense relations with Foreign 
Minister Petr Kravchenko, whom he had recently repeatedly 
criticized in the mass media, was one of the chief reasons for 
his resignation. 
  Hryb, "unlike his predecessor, has good relations with the 
foreign minister and would not like to quarrel with him because 
of me," Tsepkalo believes. 
  He agreed that "replacement of the team of advisers when a 
new head of state is elected is a normal and natural process" 
and added that he was not offended. He was thankful to the new 
speaker who "politely explained the situation, did not insist 
that I leave my position immediately, and allowed me enough time 
to find a new job." 
  By the latest reports, Tsepkalo is now in Tokyo to acquire 
first-hand knowledge of the Japanese banking system. 
  Another former adviser of Shushkevich, Professor Mikhail 
Kovalev, told Interfax that he was going to collect his last 
wage in the Supreme Soviet secretariat Thursday. He had not had 
a talk with the new speaker, but had "made up his mind to resign 
his position of an adviser and concentrate on work in the 
Belarusian State University" where he chairs a department and on 
the setting up of a Belarusian-German institute for systems 
analysis of market processes. He thinks that Dr. Anatoliy 
Mikhaylov will also resign and continue his scientific 
activities. 
  No decision has been made in the case of Ivan Stepura, the 
former speaker's adviser on interior matters and who has known 
Hryb personally since 1974. Stepura proposed abolishing 
regional structures and merging every five to six districts of 
the country into areas that would be managed directly from 
Minsk. He made numerous enemies among parliament deputies who 
represented agrarian sector managers and various local top 
officials by his demand that private ownership of land should be 
introduced, private farms encouraged, and all kinds of farmland 
property be made legally equal. 
  Stepura thinks that a decision on whether he should remain 
an 
adviser will be made once Hryb returns from St. Petersburg, 
where he will attend the CIS Inter-Parliamentary Assembly.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>
  [Text] Today, our lawmakers discussed and adopted the Law 
on Political Parties. Anatol Vyartsinski, deputy chairman of 
the Commission for Mass Media and Human Rights, delivered a 
speech on this issue. I asked him to comment on the new law. 
  [Begin recording] [Vyartsinski] The Law on Political Parties 
addresses a lot of issues. First of all, in the general 
political aspect, in a legal aspect, it admits and legalizes 
individual rights for free speech and worship, and the right to 
band with other like-minded people in political organizations. 
The law legalizes the multiparty system as a reality of our 
actual sociopolitical life. 
  [Rutkowski] Currently, we have many parties in Belarus, 
however, the Communist Party is still one of the most prominent 
ones. 
  [Vyartsinski] The law foresees equal rights for all parties. 
  [Rutkowski] So, when the election campaign begins, each 
party 
will be able to nominate an established number of candidates to 
the Supreme Soviet. Is this true? 
  [Vyartsinski] To some extent. The Law on Political Parties 
foresees that parties can participate in elections and nominate 
their candidates, and it is highly likely that future elections 
will be conducted on the basis of party lists. However, this is 
the domain of the Law on Elections [words indistinct]. [end 
recording] 
  The draft law on alternative service has been discussed by 
our deputies not for the first time. Leanid Privalow, deputy 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet Commission for National Security, 
Defense, and Crime, delivered a report on this topic. However, 
the people's deputies have various opinions on the issue of 
alternative service; many deputies oppose it. We know that this 
law exists in many civilized countries. Yes, a young person 
should be able to choose between military service and something 
else. However, the implementation of this law demands that the 
mentality of our people change. This draft law was not adopted. 
I asked Leanid Privalow to express his opinion on this issue. 
  [Begin Privalow recording] I do not want to comment on the 
behavior of some of our deputies, and I do not want to blame 
them. However, being an expert on this issue, I claim that the 
time for this law has not yet come [words indistinct]. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "News Conference of the Party of </F>
People's Accord Leadership"] 
  [Text] Today, at the National Press Center, the Party of 
People's Accord [PNZ] leadership held a news conference. 
Chairman Henadz Karpenka said that the primary PNZ task is to 
nominate candidates for the future elections to the Supreme 
Soviet. Henadz Karpenka also said that the PNZ will urge 
pre-term elections and changes in the structure of the 
Belarusian Council of Ministers. The PNZ chairman expressed full 
support for the strike which was scheduled by the Free Trade 
Unions to begin on 15 February. The reason for this is the 
Council of Ministers' unwillingness to hold talks with trade 
unions and adopt a mutually acceptable resolution. According to 
Karpenka's words, the PNZ held consultations with trade unions 
last Saturday [29 January]. With regard to the economic 
situation in the country, Henadz Karpenka stated that its change 
will be accompanied by a sharp worsening of the people's living 
standard. H. Karpenka said that presidential elections are 
necessary; however, they should be organized not by the Supreme 
Soviet, but by the people. PNZ Deputy Chairman Alaksey Karol, 
while commenting on the dismissal of Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Stanislav Shushkevich, stated that this [dismissal] has 
strengthened the authoritarian basis and brought a shift toward 
an authoritarian style of governing and the monopolization of 
power in the government's hands.

  [Text] Experts of the IMF, who recently visited Belarus, 
have encouraged the Belarusian leadership's efforts to develop 
close economic ties with Russia. They underlined the advantages 
of economic integration with Russia. At the same time, these 
advantages, according to expert opinions, do not imply the 
creation of a monetary and credit union. According to them, one 
should take into account the negative economic results for 
Belarus of the unification of the monetary and credit systems if 
Russia fails to secure its economic stabilization.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the head of the 
Georgian state, Eduard Shevardnadze, have signed in Tbilisi an 
all-embracing Treaty of Friendship and Good-Neighborliness 
between the countries. With the details Nikolay Mamuashvili. 
  [Mamuashvili] Apart from the signing of a large, so-called 
Framework Treaty on friendship and good-neighborliness, the 
sides examined and signed a whole package of agreements 
envisaging cooperation between the countries in virtually all 
spheres and fields. I will remind you that before the official 
signing ceremony, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the head 
of the Georgian state, Eduard Shevardnadze, had a one-on-one 
meeting. The heads of the Georgian and Russian foreign 
political departments -- Aleksandr Chikvaidze and Andrey Kozyrev 
-- also had talks and a discussion on questions of mutual 
interest behind closed doors. Otar Patsatsia, the republican 
prime minister, met with Oleg Soskovets, and Jaba Ioseliani, a 
Georgian parliament deputy, had talks with Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  At the conclusion of these meetings the sides stressed that 
they were completely satisfied with the results achieved. In an 
interview for an IPRINDA agency correspondent, Andrey Kozyrev 
said, I quote: We see the Interstate Treaty as a symbol for 
settling the conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, solving the 
problem of the republic's Russian-speaking population, and other 
no less important issues. 
  The so-called military part of the talks is also evoking 
undoubted interest. Russian Defense Minister Grachev, after his 
meeting with Jaba Ioseliani, said that he was also happy with 
the talks. He said that it was possible that three Russian 
military bases would be deployed in Georgia. As far as the 
subunits of Russian troops stationed in Abkhazia are concerned, 
they are now subordinate to General Fedor Reut, the commander of 
the Transcaucasian Group of Troops -- all with the exception of 
the 345th Parachute Assault Regiment that remains subordinate to 
Moscow, and Jaba Ioseliani said that all that the sides are now 
doing is being done on mutually advantageous conditions without 
any encroachments [ushchemleniya].

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Georgian leader 
Eduard Shevardnadze have ended talks in Tbilisi by signing an 
outline friendship and cooperation treaty between their 
countries. Ten other agreemnts were also signed. 
  The framework agreement binds the two sides to build 
relations as friendly nations and not to participate in any 
blocs or alliances aimed against each other. It also provides 
for bilateral consultations and appropriate measures if one of 
the sides' interests or security is threatened. 
  Speaking before flying to Tbilisi, Yeltsin said the question 
of the Russian parliament ratifying the treaty would be delayed 
until a comprehensive solution to the conflicts in Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia was found. 
  Opponents of the treaty, many of them Russian deputies, have 
attacked some of its clauses saying the two sides will sign 
further agreements to help Georgia set up its own army and 
supply it with Russian-made weapons, military hardware and 
technologies. 
  Other agreements signed by Russia's First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets and Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia are on 
trade and economic cooperation for 1994; free trade; the status 
of Russian border guards deployed in Georgia; international 
roadway communications; cooperation in areas of science and 
technology and communications; regulation of resettlement 
processes and the protection of resettlers' rights; early 
warning and elimination of emergency situations; and a protocol 
on financing Russian border troops deployed in Georgia. 
  Cooperation agreements on cultural links, science and 
education were signed by Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and 
Aleksandr Chikvaidze. 
  Earlier in the day, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
and Chief of Staff of the Georgian Defense Ministry Guram 
Nikolaishvili signed a protocol of intent providing for the 
establishment of three Russian army bases in Georgia.

<F P=106> [Opening statements and question and answer session at a </F>
news conference by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin 
and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze with correspondents in 
Tbilisi-- live] 
  [Text] [Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, deputy speaker of the 
Georgian Supreme Council] Dear colleagues, the [Russo-Georgian] 
agreement has just been signed. Talks have been held between 
the heads of states and the official delegations. After 
statements by the heads of state, Vlachislav Vasilievich and 
myself will give you a possibility to ask questions in turn, but 
please ask questions only at the microphones. 
  Boris Nikolayevich, as our guest, we ask you to make a 
statement. 
  [Yeltsin] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen. Today's visit by 
the Russian delegation to the Republic of Georgia is proceeding 
quite successfully. A major, joint work has been carried out. 
The time has come already to sum up with you at least the 
preliminary results of the meeting. I think that we have every 
grounds for satisfaction. The fates of our peoples are closely 
intertwined. From ancient times, Georgia has seen in an alliance 
with Russia the guarantees for preserving its culture and for 
saving the nation from plunging into catastrophe. Our bonds are 
strong and many-sided, and mutual fondness is genuine. 
  Everybody in Russia knows Ilia Chavchavadze [famous Georgian 
writer, poet, and public figure] and honors the memory of Grand 
Duke Bagration. Everybody has heard about Meliton Kantaria 
[Georgian soldier in WW II]. History itself calls on the 
peoples of Russia and Georgia to live in peace and agreement. 
There is no other sensible solution. We have gone through 
difficult times in the past as well; however, our great 
predecessors used to always find ways to guarantee a calm and 
respectable life for our peoples. We have no right to destroy 
what we have inherited. 
  The aims of Russian policy are clear and 
concrete--establishing not simply friendly but also allied 
relations with Georgia, of course, mutually taking into 
consideration legal, state, and national interests. 
  As you know, Eduard Ambrosyevich Shevardnadze and I have 
signed a comprehensive agreement on friendship, 
good-neighborliness, and cooperation between the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Georgia. This was the main 
official aim of the Russian president's visit to Tbilisi. We 
assess the agreement highly. The agreement lays a solid legal 
basis for our cooperation. I hope that it will work effectively 
for the development of future Russian-Georgian relations. 
  Altogether, 25 documents have been signed. Eduard 
Ambrosyevich and I have exchanged opinions on bilateral 
cooperation, on regulating the conflicts in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia, on pressing international issues, and on the situation 
in the Transcaucasus. 
  The Russian side supports a fundamental improvement of 
relations with Georgia in all fields, the speediest restoration 
of broken economic, cultural, and spiritual bonds, and a gradual 
rapprochement and integration. Joining of efforts will help our 
countries to find a way out of the complex economic situation in 
which they found themselves after the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union. 
  I would like to stress once again that Russia is proceeding 
from the necessity of observing Georgia's territorial integrity 
and fully securing the interests of the multinational population 
of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia supports a full-scale 
settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz and Georgian-Ossetian 
conflicts through peaceful political means and supports mutually 
acceptable solutions regarding state and political arrangements. 
  The Russian representatives will continue, together with the 
Georgian and Abkhaz sides and the CSCE, to participate in 
efforts directed toward regulating the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. 
They will keep on achieving considerable growth in the number 
of international observers, both military and civilian, and in 
using peacekeeping military forces in the conflict zone. 
  The issue of refugees from Abkhazia is an acute one. Russia 
is ready to assist in resolving it. We are, once again, 
addressing the sides to launch a full-scale operation for 
supporting peace in Abkhazia. The Russian contingent could also 
take part in it. The main goal of these forces is to guarantee 
a secure return of refugees. It is necessary to keep on 
searching for mutually- acceptable solutions to the conflicts in 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia that will help turn the Caucasus 
region into a zone of solid peace and stability. 
  The issue of ethnic Russians is vulnerable for us and, 
although the official stance of the Georgian authorities must 
not give us a cause for alarm, the departure from Georgia of 
150,000 Russian- speaking people over the last two years cannot 
but put us on guard. There have been instances of oppression at 
the social scale--usurpation of servicemen's apartments, etc. 
We expect an active counteraction against such negative 
occurrences and others. It is in the interests of both of the 
countries and in the interests of deepening friendship and 
cooperation between our peoples. 
  Russia is ready to cooperate bilaterally with Georgia, 
within 
the CIS, and on the international arena. Only under the 
circumstances of peace can economic and democratic developments 
be safely guaranteed. 
  Using this opportunity, I would like to express my 
gratefulness for a warm, friendly welcome extended to the 
Russian delegation in friendly Georgia. 
  Thank you for your attention. 
  [Shevardnadze] Ladies and gentlemen! Esteemed Boris 
Nikolayevich! Thank you for participating in the news 
conference, and for the attention you paid to the first official 
visit of the Russian president in our country. 
  I have already said at the negotiations that it is a 
significant event in the 200-year-old history of relations 
between our peoples. This event undoubtedly deserves great 
attention from both of our countries. I think that the 
negotiations and the documents signed here in Tbilisi--and not 
only negotiations--will assist in strengthening friendship and 
cooperation within the framework of the CIS and the region as a 
whole. 
  For the first time in the ancient history of relations 
between Russia and Georgia, we have been presented with a chance 
to build them on a totally different basis. For the first time, 
unlike in the past, we have decided to confirm each other's 
strategic aims and interests as two equal and independent 
states. For the first time following a long period marred by a 
string of events, the aftermath of which we will still have to 
be overcome through joint efforts, there is a hope for restoring 
traditionally friendly relations between our peoples. The 
importance of the visit by Boris Nikolayevich and such an 
imposing delegation goes beyond the boundaries of Russo-Georgian 
relations. The normalization of these relations is closely 
connected with the complexity of regulating the Caucasus and the 
Black Sea regions and of achieving peace and stability here. 
  Boris Nikolayevich and I talked about activating the 
Caucasian factor in the process of regulating all conflicts 
about which the whole of the world knows. It is a great tragedy 
for peoples of the Caucasus. 
  We have talked about the necessity of holding a dialogue on 
the Caucasian issue with the participation of the three 
Transcaucasian states and, naturally, with Russia's 
participation and about inviting the Russian Federation 
subjects. I mean the North Caucasian republics. By the way, I 
discussed this issue the day before yesterday with my 
colleagues, [Azerbaijani President] Geydar Aliyev and [Armenian 
President] Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who support this idea with great 
enthusiasm. 
  We have just signed a comprehensive agreement between the 
Russian Federation and Georgia. I suppose that the name speaks 
for itself. It includes friendship, good-neighborliness, and 
cooperation. This is what, for several centuries, Georgia has 
aspired for in connection with its great northern neighbor. 
  A package of documents containing many agreements have been 
signed. Boris Nikolayevich has already mentioned the number of 
the agreements. I would only like to name several that are 
principally important for our countries: agreements on free 
trade, culture, education, relations, international highway 
links, regulating the processes of migration, guarding the human 
rights of the dispossessed, and preventing and (?liquidating) 
emergency situations. Several agreements on regulating military 
cooperation have also been signed; I mean the issues connected 
with border troops and, on the whole, the status of the Russian 
Army, and many others. 
  We have, in principle, agreed to create bases for Russian 
troops. I think that it is in accordance with the interests of 
Georgia and Russia and the whole of the Transcaucasus. We have 
signed a protocol about setting up a special working group that 
will study all aspects of granting the presence of the Russian 
Army a new principle. Our primary aim is that the terms of the 
treaty and other agreements signed today be implemented as soon 
as possible. It is in the interests of Russia and Georgia and 
the whole of our region and, of course, the world's peace and 
security. It was the main subject for our present talks and 
negotiations, which were a continuation of the dialogue that had 
been started a long time ago. 
  We have examined in detail and thoroughly the status and the 
prospects of developing relations between our countries. I 
would like to stress a mutual aspiration for a comprehensive 
improvement of relations. The conclusion has been drawn that 
the current situation is favorable for this and that we will 
make every effort in order to achieve the realization of these 
goals. 
  Much time, and maybe the most significant time, was 
naturally 
devoted to Abkhazia, to the political settlement of this and 
other conflicts under the auspices of the United Nations and 
with Russia's most active participation and mediation. 
  All aspects for regulating the Georgian-Ossetian conflict 
have been discussed. I told Boris Nikolayevich that I did not 
see the reasons why we could not resolve these most complex 
issues of modern times in the near future. They are the most 
complex issues, but the traditions of friendship that are 
centuries-old and the relations between the Georgian and 
Ossetian peoples--the Georgian and Abkhaz peoples--and the 
favorable influence of Russia and the whole of the world public, 
give us a chance to resolve these issues in the near future. 
  We have also discussed the situation in the Transcaucasus on 
the whole and expressed our own views on the situation. As 
Boris Nikolayevich has already mentioned, there are no serious 
gaps between us in connection with all these pungent problems; I 
mean the region and the CIS on the whole. 
  The subject matter of our talks also included the issues of 
perfecting the activities of the CIS. Skimming through the 
international situation, we fixed our attention on the issues of 
guaranteeing collective security and the different forms of 
strategic cooperation in this important trend between regional 
and intergovernmental structures. Naturally, the results of our 
negotiations will help establish peace and calm in the 
Transcaucasus, strengthen the CIS, strengthen the alliance of 
the Black Sea countries where Russia is playing a very active 
role, as well as Georgia and our neighbors--Turkey, Ukraine, and 
other states, such as Azerbaijan and Armenia. Naturally, there 
are no conflicts between those international organizations and 
the European structures with which we are collaborating. 
  Great prospects are opened, and I would like to express deep 
gratitude to the president of Russia, Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin, and all members of the delegation for the good will 
displayed to us and the wish to establish principally new 
relations with independent and democratic Georgia. Thank you. 
  [Rcheulishvili] I would ask the journalists to introduce 
themselves, and since there are a lot of people here and not 
every one of you will be able to approach the microphones, I 
would request you to state your questions loudly. 
  [Unidentified moderator] The first question is from 
Ilyashenko, RIA Novosti. Louder. 
  [Ilyashenko] Boris Nikolayevich, have the issue of Georgia's 
joining the ruble zone or the issue of granting credits to 
Georgia been discussed during talks today? 
  [Yeltsin] Both these issues have been discussed. The issue 
of credits has been decided on the governmental level, and a 
definite sum of money will be earmarked for Georgia. As for the 
ruble zone, when Eduard Ambrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] and I were 
having tete-a-tete negotiations, we agreed that considering the 
complexity of this issue, we would set up working groups that 
will weigh everything, all pros and cons for both Georgia and 
Russia. Only after that will we make decisions. 
  [Shevardnadze] There are a lot of talks about the issue of 
the ruble zone. Some are protesting; others demand that we join 
as soon as possible. As far as I understand it, the door has 
not been opened yet, so to say. The issue should really be 
researched. 
  [Moderator] Ibervisia TV company. 
  [Correspondent] The "Monitor" program, Ibervisia Independent 
TV company. Boris Nikolayevich, what has caused such a negative 
attitude by the Duma toward your visit and the signing of the 
treaty, and why does the aspiration for the stabilization of the 
situation in Georgia stir up such a negative attitude in North 
Caucasia? 
  [Yeltsin] I do not know from what sources you draw this sort 
of information, that the Duma regards this visit negatively. 
This is an official state visit of the president of the 
country; therefore, the Duma will ratify this treaty. There is 
another thing. There will apparently be certain discussions 
during ratification, and this is not ruled out during the 
ratification of any international agreement that is being 
signed. I do not remember a treaty being ratified immediately, 
without any discussions. We also expect discussions on this 
issue. Nevertheless, I am certain that the Duma will regard 
this full-scale treaty with the independent Republic of Georgia 
positively. 
  [Correspondent] What about North Caucasia? [no reply given 
to this question as heard] 
  [Grushenko, INTERFAX correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, can 
you tell us please to what extent the comprehensive political 
treaty can assist the growth of Russia's potential for 
stabilizing the situation in the Caucasus and the Transcaucasus 
in this region. I think that Georgia also must have the say. 
Could the head of the Georgian state, esteemed Eduard 
Ambrosyevich, comment on this question too? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] During our one-on-one discussions and talks, we 
devoted most of our time to this very issue. If we do not 
regulate properly the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, 
then there will be difficulties in the development of our future 
relations. Thus, the key aim for us is to regulate these 
relations. As to how and in which way we will do it, we have 
agreed that we will be working jointly--Russia, the UN, and the 
CSCE will all act to introduce peacekeeping forces there [in 
Abkhazia]. Subsequently, Georgia must grant a definite 
political and legal status to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This 
is so that Abkhazia and South Ossetia will work together with 
Georgia on the draft of the new constitution that is being 
worked out now. It will also improve the situation. Therefore, 
I hope that with joint efforts we will manage to regulate the 
situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
  [Shevardnadze] I agree with Boris Nikolayevich, and I would 
like to add that resolving these conflicts--if we are talking 
about strategic goals, then it is the most important issue--is 
in Georgia's interest in all aspects because the country is on 
the brink of starvation, literally on the threshold of poverty. 
Our strategic interests coincide completely, and there is a 
complete, mutual understanding in this respect. As for how we 
understand strategic interests, I have already said during the 
talks that several months ago--I think it is worth 
remembering--I asked Boris Nikolayevich what Russia's strategic 
interests in the Caucasus and, in particular, Georgia, were. 
Boris Nikolayevich answered that they wanted to deal with the 
single, integral Georgia, the integral state that would develop 
democratically and have good-neighborly relations with Russia. 
I think that we understand it correctly that Russia, naturally, 
has its geopolitical and strategic interests. We have found a 
complete and mutual understanding when we talked about strategic 
interests. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Georgian News Agency. I would 
like to ask how the Russian president and the Georgian head of 
state assess the last UN resolution on Abkhazia, passed on 31 
January, and how you visualize the return of refugees to 
Abkhazia, or whether all this will remain on paper. Before I 
receive an answer to this question I would like to make use of 
an opportunity and hand over to you, Boris Nikolayevich, an 
appeal by Georgian correspondents and their Russian colleagues 
about the fate of a well-known Sukhumi correspondent, Aleksandr 
Berulava, who is still... 
  [Unidentified woman, interrupting] You can hand it to me 
later. 
  [Correspondent] All right. 
  [Yeltsin] I regard the UN resolution as the one that meets 
the interests of both the Abkhazian and Georgian peoples, as 
well as the interests of Russia as a mediator. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, will you please allow 
Georgian 
TV to ask a question? 
  [Shevardnadze] I beg your pardon, but I would like to remind 
those who ask this question or those who are interested by this 
problem that the resolution, the last UN Security Council 
resolution, was drawn up with the active participation of 
Russian representative at the United Nations. Thus I can say 
that we have a complete agreement with regard to the views and 
interests over this issue. 
  [Moderator] Sergey Medvedev, Ostankino Television, please. 
  [Medvedev] I have a question for the two leaders. 
  [Moderator] Only one question, please. 
  [Medvedev] Boris Nokolayevich, I would like to hear an 
answer 
to the following question: Boris Nikolayevich, The Abkhazian 
side, a conflicting party, is very concerned about the Union 
agreement -- let us put it this way -- with Georgia, with regard 
to the fact that Russia will participate in building up the 
Georgian Armed forces, and it is concerned that this will not 
encourage a peaceful settlement of the conflict. although I 
have been warned, I would like to get an answer to another 
question. Do you think that the economic situation Georgia has 
found itself influences this treaty, or that the signing of a 
document like this is a conclusion to a strategic trend? 
  [Yeltsin] As regards Paragraph 3 of the agreement, which 
reflects the issue of rendering assistance in building up the 
Georgian Armed Forces, we certainly do not mean a huge army. 
Georgia is unable to feed a big army. We mean a minimal number 
of forces in these armed units, assistance with equipment, and 
so on. And this is not expected today or tomorrow. This is a 
ongoing topic and it will be enough to help settle the Abkhazian 
issue. This is a common army. It is not planned for the 
territory of Georgia without Abkhazia and without Ossetia. No. 
This is an army of an integrated Georgia, and the Abkhazians do 
not have to be nervous about it. Moreover, we will be in 
complete control this issue. 
  [Shevardnadze] As for the army, we are not intending and 
actually we are not able to have a gigantic army. No one will 
threaten us, and it is unreal that we will threaten someone. 
Therefore, we will be building a small army. Without Russia, we 
are unable to create even a small army. I think this is in 
Russia's interest, too. Regarding what we had in mind when 
signing the comprehensive treaty and a package of economic and 
other agreements, I agree it was the economic situation. I 
believe that it was a mistake, a big mistake, when Georgia 
isolated itself. It did not gain anything. Neither Russia nor 
any other countries who cooperated with us gained anything. But 
not only economy. I have already spoken of a strategic interest 
between Georgia and Russia, and the interests of the 
Commonwealth states, of our neighbors. So, the approach was a 
complex one. And there was complex interest toward building new 
relations with Russia. 
  [Moderator] Introduce yourself, please. 
  [Bakhtadze] Vakhtang Bakhtadze, the FORUM newspaper. A 
question to Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Shevardnadze. It is known and 
it is a fact that the Republic of Georgia became the 179th 
member [not further specified] on the basis of the Act of 
Independence and the results of a referendum held on 31 March 
1991, when 99 percent of the people said yes to independence. 
It was said that everything infringing independence is 
unlawful. Do you not think that the agreements signed by you in 
the spheres of credits and finances, [words indistinct] and 
customs, as well as in the military sphere, are contradictory, 
to say the least, and can be regarded as a different 
interpretation of the definition of total independence and total 
sovereignty. Will you please state what you mean by the 
definition of the independent state of Russia and the 
independent state of Georgia. Thank you. 
  [Moderator] Thank you for your speech. 
  [Shevardnadze] I will answer. When drawing up and signing 
all the documents, the comprehensive treaty, the economic 
package, and all the rest, which regulate relations between the 
two countries, the interests of Georgia and the interests of 
Russia were fully considered. And if some compromise approach 
can be observed in some cases, I believe that it is impossible 
to survive without compromises during our time. I am stating 
with full responsibility that neither all these treaties nor all 
these agreements contradict the act you mentioned. They comply 
with the interests of Georgia, and not only the present Georgia 
but also tomorrow's problems and prospects. 
  [Rcheulishvili] Thank you very much, and for God's sake 
excuse us, but the time is up. 
  [Moderator] The stipulations of the protocol demand that we 
finish the news conference.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 3 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- At the end of Boris 
Yeltsin's official visit to Tbilisi, Georgian head of state 
Eduard Shevardnadze hosted a formal dinner in honor of the 
Russian Federation president. 
  In his speech at the dinner, Eduard Shevardnadze described 
the first official visit of the Russian president to independent 
Georgia as an historic event, with which hopes are being linked 
for reviving the traditions of spiritual proximity between the 
peoples of the two states. "Or, speaking in political terms, 
hopes for building fundamentally new Georgian-Russian relations 
in the spirit of equality, mutual understanding, 
good-neighborliness, and friendship," Eduard Shevardnadze said. 
Shevardnadze added that this event raises hopes for a 
"restoration of justice, which to us means restoring Georgia's 
territorial integrity." 
  In his speech, Boris Yeltsin also noted the importance of 
the 
summit in Tbilisi. "We have made mutually beneficial and 
perspective decisions in the political, economic, and other 
spheres of mutual cooperation," he underscored. 
  The Russian president said that he is determined to continue 
patiently seeking mutually acceptable solutions to the conflicts 
in Abkhazia and South Ossetia in order to transform the whole 
Caucasus into a zone of stability and stable peace. 
  In conclusion, Boris Yeltsin expressed his gratitude for the 
warm and hearty welcome "which was rendered to the Russian 
delegation in friendly Georgia," and proposed a toast toward 
friendship between the people of Russia and Georgia, and for 
their further cooperation. 
  This evening the Russian delegation left for Moscow. At 
Tbilisi Airport Boris Yeltsin and members of the Russian 
delegation were seen off by Eduard Shevardnadze, Prime Minister 
Otar Patsatsia, and other officials.

  [Text] Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev and 
Georgia's Chief of Staff Guram Nickolaishvili signed in Tbilisi 
on Thursday, February 3, a protocol of intent, which provides 
for setting up three Russian military bases in Georgia. 
  As Grachev has reported in an interview with Interfax, the 
facilities are to be located at Vaziani (30 kilometers south of 
Tbilisi), at Akhalkalaki (southern Georgia), and at Batumi (the 
Ajar Autonomous Republic). 
  As he explained, the bases will get under construction in 
1995 after the term of Russian troops interim presence expires, 
and their status will differ much from that of the Russian 
forces in Georgia now. Russia will foot the entire troops 
maintenance bill and will partly compensate for its military 
presence in Georgia. 
  Grachev emphasized that the primary goal of the bases would 
be to defend the CIS North Caucasian flank. 
  According to experts, there are about 8000 Russian 
servicemen 
in Georgia. With the formation of three bases in Georgia plus 
two facilities in Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Russian army in 
Transcaucasia will total 23,000 men.

Defense Minister Pavel Grachev by unidentified correspondent in

  [Excerpt] [Otar Patsatsia] This is an historic occasion. 
It not only has political importance but also economic 
importance. We are witnessing deep forms of fraternity and 
friendship between the Georgian and Russian peoples, and these 
are at the stage of restoration. It is necessary for us to 
restore them. We pin great hopes on this large package [of 
agreements] that was just signed. This will provide an impetus 
in the development of the economy in our republic. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you. 
  [Pavel Grachev] These issues were agreed upon at the level 
of working groups. A consent has been acquired from the two 
presidents. I had a talk with Eduard Ambrosyevich Shevardnadze 
on this subject yesterday. He confirmed all these intentions, 
and this morning our experts finished the text of the protocol 
we signed. 
  [Correspondent] Will the issue of the return of refugees to 
Abkhazia be discussed, and how safe would it be? 
  [Grachev] All issues linked with the further work, even the 
the principal treaty our presidents will sign, will certainly be 
linked with the situation in Abkhazia as well as the situation 
in South Ossetia. Indeed, without a stable political situation 
in the Georgian state, all of these good undertakings, good 
protocols, and all other good things will not gain momentum. A 
firm, good, and stable political situation is required.

  [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has 
declared that the Russo-Georgian Treaty on Friendship, Good 
Neighborliness, and Cooperation, signed in Tbilisi on February 
3, "demonstrates the vital interests both states have in each 
other." 
  In an interview with Interfax, he said that the treaty and 
the entire visit should be regarded "as a strong impetus to 
political efforts to return peace to Abkhazia and South Ossetia 
rather than a substitute for such efforts." 
  Kozyrev stressed that in defining the future status of the 
regions it was necessary to renounce force and seek "a realistic 
compromise."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A strict itinerary for the 
Russian delegation in Georgia ruled out the opportunity for a 
conversation with Russian Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. However, 
after his talks with the Georgian prime minister on 3 February, 
he found some free minutes. 
  Oleg Soskovets said that, historically, our peoples have 
always been together. Everything that is happening today 
reflects the aspiration of the two parties, that is, to support 
what was stipulated by history. One cannot gamble with the 
welfare of the people, but people can endure anything, including 
unreasonable activities, for a certain length of time. 
  Responding to our correspondent's question about the 
importance of the CIS, Mr. Oleg Soskovets said: This 
Commonwealth is an opportunity to protect our traditions, 
economic relations, and industrial union. It is necessary to 
admit that sensible unities are justified and to realize that 
the life of the people and the improvement of their life is 
principal. Now we are independent states. We have our own 
policy and free economic relations. We are building them on an 
absolutely new basis of equality. All of this is a proof that 
politicians as well as people have become wiser. 
  Asked the question, Have you discussed the issue of 
Georgia's 
joining the ruble zone with the prime minister?, Mr. Soskovets 
answered: We have not discussed the issue this time. We have 
discussed ways to arrange the restoration of broken economic 
relations and, in particular, possibilities to stabilize 
Georgia's power and fuel economy and secure transport movement 
between Georgia and Russia.

Talalayev] 
  [Text] Tbilisi February 3 TASS -- The full-scale treaty of 
friendship and cooperation signed by Russia and Georgia today, 
which is seen as "most useful to Russia in its political aspect" 
by Russian Presidential Council member Emil Paine, has met cool 
reception in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia's autonomies 
claiming greater independence. 
  Paine called their attitude "incorrect" from Russia's 
viewpoint for two reasons: "It is wrong to stick to double 
criteria in politics: if you support territorial integrity of 
Russia, you must support territorial integrity of the 
neighboring states -- there is no alternative," Paine said. "And 
it is wrong to condition the signing of an inter-state treaty on 
the settlement of internal conflicts. Problems of this kind 
exist in many countries. It is difficult to imagine someone 
order other countries not to have anything to do with Russia 
until its federal authorities settle relations with the Chechen 
Republic, for example". 
  As concerns benefits for Russia, Paine said Russia needs sea 
ports badly. Georgia has several and can provide the 
much-needed services to Russia. 
  Paine also pointed to the problem of Russian troops and 
military bases on Georgian territory. "Georgia guarantees 
required provisions for the Russian troops," he said. The two 
countries's agreement on military strategic issues is of 
significance for all Commonwealth member-countries. 
  The drawing of new borders could cost Russia tens of 
billions 
of roubles. Also important are the agreements with Georgia on 
transit transportation of Russian goods by land and sea via 
Georgia, Paine said.

  [Text] The Abkhazian Defense Ministry reported on 
continuing acts of sabotage committed by the Georgian formations 
in the Abkhazian region of Ghali. 
  The ministry's statement published on Thursday says that as 
many as 3 Abkhazian servicemen were killed during an act of 
sabotage near the populated center of Sida on February 2. 
  The document underlined that this displayed the Georgian 
formations' intention to destabilize the situation in the region 
of Ghali and to block the Abkhazian troops defending the 
Abkhazian- Georgian border on the Inguri River. 
  The Abkhazian Defense Ministry announced that it could "not 
ignore all these facts and would undertake the appropriate 
measures."

  [Text] The press center of the Georgian Defense Ministry 
told Interfax that another explosion took place today at about 
13:00 in the apartment of Georgian Deputy Defense Minister Niki 
Kekelidze, killed by the first one last night. The second 
explosion was much less powerful, but caused a slight concussion 
to Georgian Defense Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili, who came to 
see the site of the incident. 
  The press center said that no one except the minister was 
hurt and suggested that a booby trap had been installed in 
Kekelidze's apartment. 
  Meanwhile, the press center of the Georgian Interior 
Ministry 
failed to confirm the information on the second explosion.

<F P=106> [Report by Eduard Ediberidze: "In the Cabinet of Ministers. </F>
From Principled and Serious Positions"] 
  [Excerpt] The commercial port of Poti is to become the 
biggest joint-stock company in Georgia. The Georgian Cabinet of 
Ministers agreed in principle to transforming this state 
enterprise, the biggest in the republic, into a joint-stock 
company during its regular session held on 26 January under the 
chairmanship of Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia. Out of the whole 
block of shares of this future joint-stock company, which, 
according to preliminary calculations, will amount to 307.8 
billion rubles, 51 percent will be kept by the state while the 
remaining 49 percent will be owned by the port's collective, 
Poti city administration, and others wanting to buy shares both 
in the near abroad and in other foreign countries. This will 
provide the opportunity to attract solid investments for both 
the port and the city and the development of its infrastructure. 
It is significant that it is planned to organize the 
registration of shares in the port of Poti at the world's 
leading stock exchanges. The port, which assumes the function 
of a key base along the Eurasian transport corridor, will serve 
not only Georgia but also Armenia and Azerbaijan and 12 more 
countries. As Deputy Prime Minister Zurab Kervalishvili said, 
it is planned that, following the port's reconstruction and 
expansion and the building of new terminals, the volume of 
freight traffic handled by it will increase from between 3 and 4 
million to 15 million tonnes within the next two years alone. 
Moreover, according to estimates, this will ensure that the 
republic receives $120 million. 
  It was the unanimous opinion of those participating in the 
session that the transformation of the port of Poti into a 
joint- stock company should become a model for all state 
enterprises and organizations that are to become joint-stock 
companies. [passage omitted]

Has Given Georgia to Turkey... But They Do Not Know it Yet in 
Georgia"] 
  [Text] For all the variety of party movements in Georgia 
and serious differences of views between loyalists of one party 
or another, they all met Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's victory in the 
Russian elections with unanimous silence. Only Zurab Gagnidze, 
candidate of philosophic sciences and leader of the Georgian 
National Ideology Party, has sent a congratulatory telegram to 
Vladimir Volfovich on behalf of his supporters. "We are 
confident that your victory will have a positive influence on 
the attainment of genuine freedom in Georgia," the telegram 
says. "Zhirinovskiy is a nationalist in the good sense of the 
word," Gagnidze believes. We concluded from a conversation with 
the leader of national ideologists that he is attracted by the 
Liberal Democrats' economic program, Zhirinovskiy's desire to 
cut down the bureaucracy, and his struggle against American 
aggression. Zurab Gagnidze opposes the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from Georgia, saying that there has been not a single 
serious conflict in the decades while Russian soldiers were 
present here.

Dniester Moldavian Republic President Igor Smirnov said when

settlement to the Dniester conflict, in which Russia has 
mediated, have produced no practical results. According to 
Smirnov, Chisinau has rejected Tiraspols's proposal for the 
setting up of a confederation and ignored the proposal to set up 
a demilitarized zone in the area.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian 14th Army Commander Lieutenant </F>
General Aleksandr Lebed by Aleksey Chelnokov; place and date not 
given: "General Lebed: The Job Is To Bring in an Armada of 
Planes and Pretend That They Came by Themselves"] 
  [Text] Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed, at various times 
in his command of the 14th Army, has played alternately the part 
of a czarist governor general and one of Kotovskiy's red 
partisans [Kotovskiy was a civil war commander who fought in 
Moldavia]. The show of military might in the troubled 
Bessarabian boondocks has given way to raids against enemy rear. 
The current Moldovan parliamentary election campaign has been 
marked by lightning strikes against the political reputation of 
a number of rulers of the unrecognized Dniester Moldavian 
Republic. The authorities' reaction was not long in coming... 
  [Chelnokov] Aleksandr Ivanovich, how come that you, whom the 
Dniester people see primarily as the man who stopped the bloody 
war in Bendery 18 months ago, are now being accused by the 
authorities of the Dniester Moldavian Republic of virtually 
attempting a coup d'etat? 
  [Lebed] Organizing coups d'etat, the charge they are 
leveling 
at me, is not my style. I am worried about the living 
conditions and the fate of the 25,000 14th Army servicemen and 
members of their families living in the Dniester region. The 
stores here are empty, prices in the food markets are 
astronomical, there are no medicines, and teachers are leaving. 
There is complete collapse and chaos. I call the government of 
the Dniester Moldavian Republic criminal -- that is why the 
local press sometimes calls me the "black general." 
  [Chelnokov] The economic situation everywhere in the CIS 
right now is, to put it mildly, not in the best shape. The 
reasons for that, as a rule, are certainly not of a criminal 
nature.... 
  [Lebed] The Dniester region is of tremendous interest to the 
Russian military-industrial complex. There are several unique 
defense enterprises here. I know that First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets would like to invest resources in this production, but 
the reputation of the local leaders as thieves is an obstacle. 
When these people get credits they shout for joy, plug a few 
holes in the budget, but put half the money in their own 
pockets. A bunch of adventurists has come to power in the 
Dniester Moldavian Republic by exploiting people's natural 
desire for freedom. 
  [Chelnokov] In Russia it has long been the fashion to talk 
about mythical suitcases packed full of sensational documents 
allegedly attesting to the corruption of officials. Are you not 
afraid of finding yourself in the same tricky position as many 
Moscow setters of that fashion? 
  [Lebed] I have sent a number of documents corroborating my 
accusations to the Dniester region's ministries of internal 
affairs and state security. What was the result? The rejected 
documents rebound against those who brought them. I sent a 
stack of compromising materials to the Russian law enforcement 
agencies -- the Military Prosecutor's Office, the General 
Prosecutor's Office, the Security Ministry, and 
counterintelligence. I do not know where it has all gone... It 
is a vicious circle. 
  [Chelnokov] In that case what is the point of your 
revelations? To prompt the Dniester region's people to civil 
disobedience? 
  [Lebed] I am calling for a civilized way out of the 
impasse in which the Dniester people find themselves. People 
must know that the hierarchy of the Dniester Moldavian Republic 
is politically compromised by participation in the October 
events in Moscow. On the instructions of President Smirnov 
there were between 70 and 110 people from the Dniester region in 
the White House on that day, according to various sources of 
information. As a consequence, Defense Minister Grachev phoned 
me 14 October and authorized me to notify this "criminal 
government" that all ties with them would be broken off. 
  [Chelnokov] So in your opinion the only obstacle to the 
settlement of the Moldovan conflict is the leadership of the 
Dniester Moldavian Republic? 
  [Lebed] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur is not fated to be 
a peacemaker either. A single phrase which he used on 
television when there were killings and robberies taking place 
in Bendery -- "Everything is fine, the constitutional process is 
being restored" -- turned him into a political corpse. Only the 
simultaneous replacement of the authorities in Chisinau and 
Tiraspol will make it possible to break the deadlock in the 
peace process and set a precedent for involving the Russian 
economy in the Dniester region. 
  Snegur is now being most comprehensively wiped out. Moldovan 
speaker Lucinschi is gradually destroying him in all spheres. 
In the near future -- after the parliamentary elections -- 
Lucinschi will replace Snegur, you mark my words. 
  [Chelnokov] Is the 14th Army prepared for a change in the 
political situation in Moldova? 
  [Lebed] A certain military-political balance of forces has 
now been established in this region. The armed forces of 
Moldova and the Dniester region are semi-guerrilla, semi-militia 
gangs. It is no great difficulty to set one off against the 
other. The 14th Army, which represents the only real military 
force, is playing the part of the notorious sword of Damocles 
here and is thus maintaining relative stability. 
  [Chelnokov] You have written a book called "The Spectacle 
Called a Putsch" ["Spektakl po imeni putch"] and the various 
events in which you have taken part are often called theater or 
circus. What is your role in this? 
  [Lebed] I am a player-coach. This is an enforced role 
dictated by Central Committee practice which still persists. 
Ever since Sumgait in 1988 I have not received a single written 
order, it is all done by phone. "Fly down there. Things are not 
going well. Establish order," and that is all. For example, I 
went to Tbilisi with three regiments -- in 140 military 
transport planes. Imagine the job that we had: to get dozens of 
planes from different cities, form them into an airborne armada, 
fly down there, and then, when Gorbachev expressed surprise, we 
had to pretend: The devil only knows how they got down 
there.... Nothing has changed since that time.

  [Text] Today in Chisinau the Penal Judiciary Collegium of 
the Supreme Court of the Republic of Moldova examined the case 
and annulled the sentence passed on 9 December 1993 against the 
[Ilie] Ilascu group. The case is to be returned to the State 
Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Moldova in view of 
opening penal procedures against the judges belonging to the 
anti-constitutional court in Tiraspol, who participated in the 
passing of the illegitimate sentence that jeopardized the life, 
freedom, and health of those sentenced. 
  At the same time the Moldovan body decided to terminate the 
preventive arrest of the six [members of the Ilascu group]. 
  In a statement made to our correspondent, Nicolae Gore, a 
member of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic of 
Moldova, emphasized the fact that today's court ruling annuls 
the Tiraspol sentence and all its consequences. According to 
the laws of the Republic of Moldova, as soon as the sentence was 
annulled, the Ilascu group has to be released from jail, added 
Nicolae Gore.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Kazakh Ambassador Myrzadai </F>
Zholdasbekov by unidentified JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI correspondent in 
Tehran "on the sidelines of the fourth foreign ministers' 
conference of the Economic Cooperation Organization"] 
  [Text] [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, recently an 
agreement was signed on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine by 
the leaders of Russia, the United States, and Ukraine. Reports 
are being carried in the international mass media that there are 
efforts to sign a similar accord with all the republics of the 
former Soviet Union that have nuclear weapons, including 
Kazakhstan. What is your opinion on these efforts? 
  [Zholdasbekov] We are responsible for safeguarding our 
nuclear weapons. Until all countries in the world guarantee 
that they will not use nuclear arms and the world is rid of such 
weapons, we will not destroy them or transfer them elsewhere. 
We are aware of the accord signed on the nuclear disarmament of 
Ukraine. However, we believe that disarmament should be 
accompanied by a world guarantee that such weapons will not be 
used. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] You have not announced this stance 
openly and officially. 
  [Zholdasbekov] Our stance on this matter will be conveyed to 
the U.S. President on 17 February when Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev goes to the United States. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Why do you wish to report this to the 
U.S. President? 
  [Zholdasbekov] Our president is visiting the United States 
at the official invitation of the U.S. President. Naturally, 
the objective of his visit is not to provide any clarification 
on nuclear weapons. However, it is natural that Mr. Clinton 
will speak to Mr. Nazarbayev about Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons. 
I mean that during these talks Mr. Nazarbayev will convey our 
country's official stance to the U.S. President. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, it is clear that Russia 
is constantly seeking to extend its domination over all the CIS 
countries. Do you believe this? 
  [Zholdasbekov] It is not to our advantage to magnify such 
points. In view of the extensive economic and industrial 
relations that we have with the Russians, we do not consider it 
appropriate to overshadow these relations with political issues. 
We should keep in mind that we have the longest common border 
with Russia and that we should be seeking logical and principled 
ways to broaden these relations. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do you have any political or economic 
news about Kazakhstan for us? 
  [Zholdasbekov] Yes. In the economic field, I wish to tell 
you that in the last few days of 1993 (that is one month ago) we 
replaced the ruble with our own monetary unit, the tenge. In 
the political field, I may add that soon parliamentary elections 
will be held in Kazakhstan. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How soon? 
  [Zholdasbekov] On 7 March.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikita Yermakov and </F>
Konstantin Pribytkov: "Kazakhstan's Future Is With Russia"] 
  [Text] When Kazakhstan was part of the Soviet Union, few 
people were familiar with it, and from this point of view 
participation in the Davos World Economic Forum provides an 
opportunity to showcase the republic, its potential, its 
legislation, and its development potential, President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said in an interview with ITAR-TASS 
correspondents. 
  At first the West did not understand the real situation in 
the economies of the CIS countries, the Kazakhstani head of 
state went on to say. Now it is starting to understand the 
realities taking shape in the CIS. If I myself had not believed 
in the Commonwealth's potential, I would never have been a 
fervent supporter of the integration process. The fact that the 
ruble zone, for which I also fought, has collapsed attests to 
what has now become clear: We are different. The economies and 
the states are different. We have become really independent 
states. Some people, maybe among the Russian political 
establishment, dislike this. As for Kazakhstan, I firmly 
declare (not because I am afraid or apprehensive of something or 
because I am engaging in intrigue): Strategically, Kazakhstan's 
future is with Russia. The future of the people, the future of 
the state, the future of the economy. This is not only 
advantageous to Kazakhstan, it is also advantageous to Russia. 
If we speak of independence, Russia was the first to proclaim 
sovereignty in 1990. I was astounded at the time: from whom, 
from what? But what is there to be surprised at now? 
  I do not regard sovereignty and independence as an end in 
itself, the president went on to point out. The end is to 
improve people's lives and the economy through this. When any 
state signs some agreement, it assumes obligations and gives up 
part of its sovereignty. The CIS countries' integration must 
now proceed along a path similar to the West European one, as 
the EC is doing. They are all independent states in the EC, and 
they all have their own currency, political independence, and 
freedom. Here, I believe, fate itself has determined a very 
important place for Russia. Russia can act as a unifier by fully 
recognizing sovereignties and not exerting any pressure, and 
maybe it can forgo some things at first. We must do as the West 
Europeans did, only not travel this path in 30 years, like they 
did, but in a shorter space of time.

  [Text] Despite lessening tension on the Karabakh fronts, 
the Azerbaijani troops are still trying to advance in several 
directions. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press Service 
reported that large enemy forces, mostly armored cars, launched 
an attack yesterday against Karabakh positions in the direction 
of Martuni and Gadrut. The offensive lasted from morning until 
late at night. After losing five tanks and 30 soldiers on the 
battlefield, the Azerbaijani troops retreated to their initial 
positions. Two Karabakh fighters died and seven were wounded. 
  Relative calm prevailed on the other sectors of the front 
until noon today. 
  The same source reported that an Azerbaijani Air Force plane 
appeared over Karabakh at around 1030 today. According to 
preliminary reports, the enemy plane was most probably engaged 
in a reconnaissance flight. Azerbaijani attack planes bombed 
the settlements in Askeranskiy Rayon at 1100. Casualty figures 
are being determined. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service has reported 
that 
the calm prevailing on the border for the past three days has 
not been violated. We talked with the Press Service a short 
time ago and were informed that the situation on the border 
remained unchanged at 1930.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sergey Bablumyan: "The Armenian </F>
President's Team: Artem Atalyants and Others"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- Yerevan newspapers often publish old 
photographs of Levon Ter-Petrosyan and his friends from the 
Karabakh Committee. There is nothing surprising in the fact 
that the same people still surround him now and that some of 
them are members of the president's team. 
  They all helped to found the current ruling party, the 
Armenian National Movement; the Karabakh Committee flowed 
smoothly down into it. Observers usually include parliamentary 
Speaker Babken Ararktsyan, Interior Minister Vanik Siradegyan, 
and, until recently, Chief National Security Adviser to the 
President Ashot Manucharyan in the circle of people closest to 
Ter-Petrosyan. Public opinion gives Siradegyan a special place 
among those closest to the president. The interior minister's 
almost unlimited freedom of action and independent conduct and 
opinions make these comments convincing enough. Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan has repeatedly expressed public satisfaction with 
the work done by Vanik Siradegyan's department. In turn, the 
interior minister categorically rules out the possibility of any 
difference of opinion with the president. 
  The president is helped in forming and implementing domestic 
policy by members of the Armenian National Movement, his loyalty 
to which he never tires of reiterating. It is Armenia's most 
liberal political party and favors cooperation not only with 
Russia and the West, but also with the East -- with Turkey and 
Iran. 
  According to people in the know, Levon Ter-Petrosyan's 
economic views were formed under the influence of Prime Minister 
Grant Bagratyan and his predecessor, now Armenian Vice President 
Gagik Arutyunyan. As far as the well-known businessman Artem 
Atalyants is concerned, foreign economic issues are his sole 
responsibility as chief adviser to the president. Some 
observers assessing the situation in this sphere make no secret 
of their skepticism; this, incidentally, applies equally to the 
economic situation in the republic itself. 
  The average age of the president's closest entourage is 
40-45. It is widely held in Armenia that the president's team is 
virtually entirely made up of his former fellow students from 
the Yerevan University Oriental Studies Department, as well as 
his work colleagues from the Institute of Ancient Manuscripts, 
the Matenadaran. In actual fact his team includes lawyers, 
economists, mathematicians, even musicologists, and, of course, 
orientalists. 
  A recent adviser, Vagan Papazyan, now heads the Armenian 
Foreign Ministry. This appointment is seen as a logical 
continuation of the president's cadre policy, as he earlier 
assigned another of his advisers, U.S. citizen Zhirayr 
Liparityan, to the same department. Continuing to work as first 
deputy minister, according to well informed sources, he is still 
one of the president's most trusted consultants in the foreign 
policy sphere. 
  Vazgen Sarkisyan, the president's chief military adviser, 
was 
a journalist until recently. According to many military 
specialists, he has quickly mastered military matters and no one 
in Armenia doubts his personal courage. 
  The opposition accuses Levon Ter-Petrosyan's closest 
associates of being incompetent, of being out of touch with the 
people's real problems and concerns, and of having totally 
forgotten their promises. The president's team does not 
outwardly respond to these attacks, although some members assess 
the results of their activity fairly soberly. But they stay 
with the president and, according to one of his comrades, if 
anyone were forced to leave it would only be "because of 
incredible physical exhaustion." 
  It is extremely rare for one of the president's closest 
entourage to leave on his own initiative, and in this sense the 
departure of former chief adviser Ashot Manucharyan is the 
exception. 
  "He only left because he wanted to leave," is the official 
comment on the resignation of one of the most influential 
members of the president's closest entourage. Few people in 
Armenia believe that Ashot Manucharyan has left the political 
scene for long.

  [Text] Speaking in the Federation Council on Thursday, the 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said that the Cabinet 
intends to pursue a rather tough fiscal policy. 
  He reported plans to pay 3 Tn rubles over the first four 
months of the year towards the state debt to enterprises, this 
is only one-third of the state's total debt. 
  According to his forecast, inflation would mount at a rate 
of 
under 20% over 8 months of this year. In January, inflation 
growth was about 25%, which the minister blamed largely on last 
year's decisions to index amortization deductions and raise a 
number of tariffs, as well as on inflationary expectations. 
  By the end of the year, inflation is to be curbed "down to 
7-9% and may be down to 3-5%," Shokhin said. 
  In his words, the government will pursue a tough fiscal 
line, 
will oblige enterprises to account for all their expenses, and 
will provide funds only for concrete projects. The minister 
believes that this could keep taxes under control. 
  He spoke in favor of selective structural policy and 
remarked 
that over the 10 days as economics minister he could not be 
proud of the fact that centralized funds had not been spent 
where they might have done the best good. 
  In regard to social security, Shokhin stressed the need for 
effective help to the poor. He recognized as fair the IMF's 
criticism of Russia for its neglect of social security. 
  He spoke in favour of fixing an official unemployment limit. 
Official statistics put the number of unemployed at 1 Mn, but by 
other estimates, there are 4 Mn without work plus 4 Mn 
unregistered jobless. 
  On economic cooperation with CIS countries, Shokhin wished 
that cooperation with them to be closer "but not at the expense 
of our interests." In his words, negotiations are still under 
way with Belarus on how to integrate the monetary systems of the 
two countries. This mechanism, he said, is to be ready by the 
week-end. 
  Although Russia has a positive balance of trade with its CIS 
partners, Shokhin spoke with anxiety about the flow of capital 
out of Russia. He voiced hope that better legislation could 
return this money to Russia. In foreign trade, the government 
will continue the course toward liberalization, including the 
reduction of a number of quotas and the abolition of export 
tariffs. 
  Shokhin on the whole rejected the proposals carried in the 
report on the social and economic situation in Russia, drawn up 
by three noted economists Leonid Abalkin, Nikolai Petrakov, and 
Stanislav Shatalin. The paper "is appealing from the point of 
view of what should not be done," Shokhin said. But the 
proposals are too general by nature, he added. 
  The Economics Ministry will formulate a more detailed view 
on 
the report after its discussion by the ministry's board next 
week, Shokhin said.

  [Text] At its session today, the Federation Council (upper 
chamber of the Russian parliament) approved the candidacy of 
Yevgeniy Krestyaninov as chairman of the parliamentary 
commission for procedural matters. 
  The parliamentarians also adopted an address to the 
president 
and the prime minister devoted to the situation in agriculture. 
  The address points out that "the unilateral approach to 
carrying out agrarian reforms, reduced to restructuring 
ownership of land, privatization and reorganization of 
collective farms and state-owned farms" led to a fall of 
agricultural output of 65-70% over the last two years against 
the average annual level in 1986-1990. 
  State programs for constructing homes, gas, electricity and 
hot water installations, building roads and developing the 
telephone network in the country have been curbed. 
  Due to the inadequate increase of prices of manufactured 
goods against agricultural products, virtually all farms went 
bankrupt. As a result, Russians have to consume less domestic 
agricultural products against the background of growing imports 
of foreign goods at the expense of destroying Russia's 
agriculture. 
  Members of the Federation Council called on the government 
to 
consider a complex of agricultural issues at its next session. 
It is extremely necessary that real aid to agriculture be 
rendered until the beginning of field work in the spring. 
  The session also passed a resolution demarcating the new 
border between the Ivanovo and Nizhnyy Novgorod regions. 
  According to the decision to send a Federation Council 
commission to the area of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, the 
session formed a group of 4 deputies. 
  The session also approved a document regulating the 
implementation of the law "On guarantees and compensation for 
persons working and residing in the northern most regions of 
Russia and regions with similar adverse climate conditions." 
The document points to the need to strictly observe the 
privileges for the regions' residents envisioned during the 
preparation of the budget. The Federation Council will hold 
parliamentary hearings to look into the issue this March. A 
number of parliamentary committees will use their results as the 
basis for developing a draft law on the issue.

<F P=106> [Aleksandra Lugovskaya report: "Senators Demand Premier's </F>
Appearance"] 
  [Text] V. Chernomyrdin's expected speech in the Federation 
Council did not take place 3 February. 
  The prime minister's refusal to come and give information 
about government policy was regarded by the senators not only as 
a lack of respect for the upper house of parliament but also as 
a political gesture. 
  It was maybe the first time the deputies had used such harsh 
terms in demanding that V. Shumeyko explain why the meeting was 
shelved. In response the speaker cited the most diverse 
arguments. Specifically, that without a discussion of this 
question at a special government session Chernomyrdin's speech 
would be of an unofficial nature and would reflect his personal 
viewpoint. That a session of the Cabinet of Ministers Presidium 
had begun on the morning of 3 February. In addition, it was 
learned that the premier is flying to Minsk in the evening while 
O. Soskovets, his first deputy, is in Georgia. And that Economy 
Minister A. Shokhin will speak in the Federation Council. 
  Shumeyko reminded all his colleagues that it is his job as 
speaker to conduct sessions and keep order, not to deliver the 
premier there. 
  But Shumeyko's arguments merely added fuel to the fire: Even 
sterner words followed from the microphones -- about the 
Federation Council's role and place in Russia's political life. 
For example, a deputy from Udmurtia said that he is not greatly 
concerned by what is happening in Belarus -- right now there is 
a crisis situation in his own Udmurtia and in Russia as a whole: 
"We want to know our government's actions in the next few days." 
  After a heated debate the senators again instructed the 
speaker to hold talks with the premier and to inform him during 
the recess of the house's insistent wish to see him on the 
Federation Council platform on 3 February.

  [Text] At its evening session today, the Federation Council 
discussed the status of its deputies and issues related to the 
maintenance of their activities. The deputies decided to return 
to the consideration of their status later, since the State Duma 
had not yet passed the law "On the status of the deputy of the 
Federal Assembly." 
  The session approved the structure of the chamber's staff 
and 
set their salaries equal to those of government support staff. 
Each deputy will have an unlimited number of assistants and 
manage a fund equal to 80 minimum salaries plus guaranteed 
bonuses and compensations to pay their salaries out of. 
  The Federation Council scheduled its next session for 
February 18. 
  The draft agenda of the next meeting includes discussing the 
findings of the council's commission in the area of the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict, approving the composition of 
parliamentary committees, looking into the results of the 
activities by the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly and passing a 
plan of legislative activities. The Federation Council also 
plans to invite Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on the same 
day. 
  As was announced before, Russian President Boris Yeltsin is 
expected to make his annual address to the Federal Assembly on 
social and economic policies on February 18.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Todres report in the "Federation Council" column: </F>
"The Senate `Has Not Yet Bestirred Itself.' The Local 
Authorities Will Not Miss Their Chance in Any Event"] 
  [Text] Here is the first impression from the second 
session of the Federation Council: compared to the previous 
one, where Vladimir Shumeyko just barely made it into the 
speaker's chair, giving out alluring promises on behalf of the 
president, now everything is moving slowly and sluggishly. 
  It was thought that the upper house would immediately "show 
its teeth" to the president, the government, and the capital in 
general. Instead the senate began to spend hours discussing 
internal rules of procedures. The apparatus officers consider 
this as evidence of "serious and careful work of true 
parliamentarians." Nonetheless, they had to approve the 
decision on Boris Yeltsin's edict on the state of emergency in 
the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone without actually seeing the 
document: It was not even circulated. The famous proponents of 
autonomy, Yakutia President Mikhail Nikolayev and his Bashkir 
counterpart Murtaza Rakhimov, have not attended the high meeting 
for two days. Karelian leader Viktor Stepanov did not arrive at 
all. "We have not as yet bestirred ourselves," Boris Yeltsin's 
perennial opponent, Aman Tuleyev, admitted. 
  The general mood of the senators themselves was summed up in 
a remark by Novosibirsk governor Ivan Indink: "When are we 
finally going to get down to business? I am talking about the 
economy and the tax system." Irkutsk administration chief Yuriy 
Nozhikov added "questions of resources and export" to this list. 
Federation Council members are making no secret that in 
demanding a meeting with Premier Chernomyrdin, they seek to 
understand not so much the present situation in the economy as 
the intentions of the government and how far it is ready to 
yield to pressure from the provinces. 
  As Omsk Oblast governor Leonid Polezhayev admitted, the 
deputies' "abilities to protect local interests" would be 
greatly expanded by the creation of their regional associations. 
"Territorial factions," however, are in no particular hurry to 
emerge. So far there is only Eduard Rossel, who told SEGODNYA 
that 14 senators and 32 Duma members have joined the Urals 
Deputies Association he is setting up, while the Urals Economic 
Association has created within its framework a "foundation for 
sociopolitical studies," allocating it the requisite funds. The 
foundation, according to Rossel, will be responsible for 
"coordinating draft laws not only among the deputies but also 
those Urals enterprises that will be affected by these draft 
laws." 
  Other regions are in no hurry to unite. Even Irkutsk 
governor Yuriy Nozhikov and his Khabarovsk colleague Viktor 
Ishayev, who have actually proclaimed a "financial state of 
emergency" in their regions and stopped remitting taxes to the 
federal budget, prefer to meet with Viktor Chernomyrdin 
separately. 
  According to Mr. Nozhikov, the first watershed in the senate 
will be between the regional bosses and the few "dispossessed" 
deputies: "Unlike us, they are not responsible for the regions 
and therefore will start seeking a stable position in Moscow. 
This will be the fifth column of the central authority." 
  As for the local authorities, they are apparently bound to 
divide: the interests of kray and oblast bosses still differ 
substantially from the wishes of the ethnic autonomy bosses. 
Only after that will come the time of "territorial factions." 
It is important that these divisions will not weaken but 
actually strengthen the senate: It is all the easier to promote 
one's interests, the more conspicuous they are. 
  The Federation Council leadership has assured that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin will make a speech today.

  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS--The Russian State Duma will 
discuss the address of the Russian president, in which he warned 
lawmakers against violating the Constitution, while adopting the 
permanent procedural rules, speaker Ivan Rybkin told the lower 
chamber on Friday. The discussion is scheduled for next week. 
  Boris Yeltsin sent an address to both chambers of the 
Russian 
parliament reminding them that, according to the Constitution, 
decisions are considered adopted if they receive support of more 
than a half of the total constitutionally-envisaged number of 
deputies. 
  However, while adopting interim procedural rules, lawmakers 
interpreted the notion of the "total number of deputies" as the 
total number of elected lawmakers, although several seats are 
still vacant in each of the chambers. 
  The president requested the deputies "to bring the interim 
rules in accordance with the Constitution".

  [Text] The State Duma's Council, comprising its Chairman, 
his deputies, and the factions leaders, has decided to put off 
the presidential amnesty decree indefinitely. The earlier-set 
discussion date was Friday, February 4. 
  The amnesty declaration was prompted by the adoption of 
Russia's Constitution on December 12, 1993. According to the 
basic law, the right to declare amnesty rests with the Duma, the 
Lower House of the Federal Assembly, parliament in Russia. 
  Drafted by the Russian President's State Management 
Department, the decree provides for pardoning certain categories 
of prisoners, World War Two veterans and women included. 
  No faction has unequivocally supported the decree. Yegor 
Gaydar, the leader of "Russia's Choice," has suggested in an 
interview with Interfax that amnesty should be carried out in 
line with specific penal code clauses rather than categories of 
prisoners. 
  At a news-conference a week ago, the LDP faction's leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy reiterated his faction's call for freeing 
all political convicts and those jailed for economic 
mismanagement as of March 1985. "What Russia's president wants 
to do at this time is to pardon criminals," he stressed. 
  The faction of communists and agrarians intend to press for 
the release of all those charged for complicity in the events of 
August 1991 and October 1993.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Volkov report under the "Policy" rubric: "Society </F>
Will Choose Between Spontaneous Pricing and Administrative 
Measures. The Final Decision Rests With the Executive Branch"] 
  [Text] Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma's 
Economic Policy Committee, said yesterday in a press conference 
that he expects the government to work out a single program of 
anticrisis measures. Differences at the Council of Ministers 
are "a common thing," but they should be resolved "within the 
government," he said. At the same time, the Duma is in no way 
intent on "imposing on the government its approach" to adjusting 
economic policy. Parliamentary hearings on the economic 
situation and anticrisis measures in Russia, which have been 
scheduled for 10 February, will apparently provide the stage for 
competition among a number of draft programs. 
  Mr. Glazyev said that he fully understood Boris Fedorov's 
statement that he did not know "nonmonetarist methods of 
fighting inflation." "A finance minister does not have other 
levers but monetarist ones," he said, "but if Boris Fedorov were 
an industry minister," he would have taken into account the need 
to pursue structural policy and to provide government support. 
  Mr. Glazyev said also that the struggle of industrial 
sectors' representatives for raising customs tariffs was going 
on at the Council of Ministers. In his words, "as a result of 
the hyperinflation of the last two years and the artificial 
propping up of the ruble exchange rate in the past six months," 
Russian products have become uncompetitive even in the fuel 
sector. 
  According to Mr. Glazyev, "specialists and the industrial 
establishment have been particularly dismayed by the excessive 
tax burden placed on the current incomes" of enterprises. "A 
fairly chaotic tax system impedes the government's actions and 
destimulates production," he said. The approach being worked 
out by his committee will apparently call for cutting corporate 
taxes and increasing rent payments. 
  Sergey Glazyev is considered an advocate of the state's 
active intervention in economic processes in Russia. Among 
other things, his committee plans to submit to the State Duma 
draft laws on indicative planning, on managing government-owned 
enterprises, and so forth, and also to get around to devising 
approaches to Russia's pricing problems. Mr. Glazyev believes 
that "society has to choose" one alternative: either 
spontaneous pricing or an administrative regulation of prices. 
  In the first case, Sergey Glazyev said, it is necessary to 
carry out a regular general indexation, including budget 
revenues, expenditures, and the amounts of centralized credits. 
But we should take into account that in current conditions the 
period of "galloping inflation" may last "fairly long." 
  If an approach calling for administrative price regulation 
gains the upper hand, "prices in various sectors will have to be 
temporarily frozen, profitability limits established, and state 
subsidies introduced." Administrative methods, however, may 
turn out to be ineffective owing to "a lack of administrators in 
the conditions of a very loose executive discipline," Mr. 
Glazyev said. In any event, despite his own reference to 
society, Mr. Glazyev divulged that "the final decision rests 
with the government." 
  This confidence in the current government displayed by a 
moderate reformer, an advocate of structural policy and the 
reintegration of the economy by setting up financial-industrial 
groups, may be easily attributed to the similarity between his 
concepts and the ideas of specialists who drew up economic 
documents in the "post-Gaydar" government. What is 
disconcerting, however, is Mr. Glazyev's remark about a lack of 
possibilities for normal administration in Russia. It is 
unlikely that he meant lackluster or corrupt bureaucrats. To 
all appearances, the issue is the functional unpreparedness of 
the Russian administrative system for influencing economic 
processes in an efficient and rational way. 
  This means that monetarist declarations, made in order to 
regain the West's confidence, will also remain a "paper dragon" 
for the domestic industry, and structural policy will boil down 
to sectoral lobbying motivated not by the selection of promising 
industries, but by the struggle for survival among managers who 
have access to government offices. In Mr. Glazyev's words, 
economic activity in Russia comes down and, admittedly, will 
continue to come down, to the reallocation of state resources.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "`Military Package' Laws in Line </F>
for Clarification. State Duma Defense Committee Starts Work"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday [1 February] a session of the State Duma 
Defense Committee was held at which the main areas of the 
committee's activity, its structure, and the plan of its work 
for February were discussed. A final decision on the main 
issues was postponed until Thursday. 
  In this case, the postponement is due to the sheer volume of 
questions under discussion -- basically, the main issue revolves 
around conceptual approaches toward legal support for Army 
reforms. Three main directions have been defined in the 
committee's work -- in the sphere of defense security, 
regulation of the Armed Forces' activity, and social protection 
for servicemen. Let us not go into detail for the time being, 
let us note merely that the parliamentarians proceeded from the 
formula proposed by Committee Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Piskunov 
that they should first of all plan what the Duma absolutely must 
do during its allotted two years. The priorities included an 
analysis of the Russian Federation president's annual message 
about the state of the country and preparation of conclusions 
regarding the part dealing with defense, work on the defense 
sections of the federal budget, amendments to the Russian 
Federation laws "On Defense" and "On Military Service Obligation 
and Military Service" in accordance with the new Russian 
Federation Constitution and the experience of the implementation 
of these laws, and also a whole range of problems to do with 
social support for servicemen and military pensioners. 
  The plan for February includes work to clarify the laws in 
the "military package," hearings into the state of preparation 
and implementation of the START I Treaty, and hearings into the 
prospects for the ratification of START II. New draft laws 
include "On States of Emergency," "On the Sale of Released 
Ministry of Defense Assets and Military Property," and "On 
Martial Law." The Army's mobilization readiness, the troops' 
morale, and a number of other questions also fall within the 
committee's purview. 
  Party bloc disagreements did take place, but Committee 
Chairman Sergey Yushenkov, like, incidentally, the other 
committee members, did not wish to aggravate relations. 
Everyone agreed that it was necessary to dispense with the 
organizational prelude and get down to actual lawmaking as soon 
as possible. Admittedly, a hitch nevertheless occurred when 
Yevgeniy Loginov, representative of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia (and Yushenkov's deputy) started talking about the 
need first and foremost to define a position with regard to the 
military doctrine, the present provisions of which, in his view, 
suit specific political imperatives but not Russia's strategic 
interests. Supported by his party colleague Georgiy Lukava, he 
proposed that the committee members agree with the claim of the 
Geopolitics Committee to be the highest authority in the expert 
analysis of draft laws affecting the state's strategic 
interests. However, there was no polemic, because every 
committee has the right to state its opinions about a particular 
matter, and as far as the military doctrine is concerned, at 
some time or another they will have to come back to it anyway in 
their work on the Russian Federation president's annual message.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Yushenkov, head of State Duma defense </F>
committee, by Oleg Odnokolenko; place and date of interview not 
given: "Sergey Yushenkov: Defense Should Not Be Subject of 
Political Quarrels"] 
  [Text] Sergey Nikolayevich Yushenkov was born in Tver 
Oblast in 1950. he graduated from the Novosibirsk Higher 
Military Political College and the Military-Political Academy. 
He is a colonel and candidate of philosophical sciences. In 
1990 he was elected a Russian Soviet Federated Socialist 
Republic people's deputy. Since 1992 he ha been first deputy 
leader of the Russian Federation Federal Information Center. He 
now heads the State Duma defense committee. 
  [Odnokolenko] Sergey Nikolayevich, you are now quite a well 
known figure. Nonetheless his public statements give a very 
superficial idea of a man's inner world. What do you live by, 
what are your world view and ideals? 
  [Yushenkov] The answer to that question is a lengthy one. 
My views have undergone a quite substantial evolution. There 
was a time when I, like many people in our country, was carried 
away by communist ideas. Actually, even now I consider it true 
to assert that the comprehensive development of each person is 
an essential condition for the comprehensive development of all. 
It is another matter that it was considerably later that I 
discovered that this idea is not actually a communist one but 
rather a general human one. That became clear when I was able 
to read other books, not only the recommended ones, on history 
and philosophy. 
  Actually, the process of my reassessment of values was not 
that simple or rapid. Back at the Novosibirsk higher 
military-political college my comrades and I reached the 
conclusion that something completely different from what was 
written in the textbooks was being implemented in the country in 
practice. And we tried to create -- this was in the second year 
-- a "genuine Marxist-Leninist party." We even held several 
secret sessions with all the attributes appropriate in such 
cases. 
  In general it must be said that at that time secret 
organizations were a kind of epidemic. And specifically in 
military-political colleges. These organizations appeared at 
the Leningrad and Donetsk colleges and other humanitarian higher 
education establishments. As a result many boys were put in 
prison. We avoided that fate. Why? To be honest, we were 
frightened and took no further steps. But that is not the only 
reason. Even then we realized that there was nothing left to 
"perfect." The documents which we had drafted in secret with 
great exertion could be categorized as communist or rather 
social democratic. 
  [Odnokolenko] How big was your organization? 
  [Yushenkov] Big enough -- about 15 people. What surprises 
me pleasantly to this day is that there were no traitors among 
us. That means we knew how to choose friends and even now we 
are pleased to meet. Incidentally, we dissolved our secret 
organization on a sufficiently plausible pretext: We said we 
still did not know much so we could not assess correctly what 
was happening in the country. It was decided that each of us 
must enter the academy because only there was broader access to 
the sources of knowledge possible. 
  That was somewhat naive, of course, but what else could be 
expected from young boys? 
  [Odnokolenko] But later you not only graduated from the 
military-political academy but also taught in it. Incidentally, 
what course did you read? 
  [Yushenkov] I read logic and dialectical and historical 
materialism but mostly dialectical materialism. 
  [Odnokolenko] How was a teacher preaching democratic 
convictions received in the political academy? 
  [Yushenkov] When I, for one, read lectures and said that we 
needed a multiparty system and private ownership for every 
possible reason, initially this generated keen hostility not 
only with the party commission but also with the students 
themselves. But later, when proof and references to the classic 
Marxist writers had been cited the tone of our talks changed. 
Of course, it was mainly creative people who entered the 
military-political academy, although they were adepts of 
communist ideology. If there was a need to investigate 
something, they would go to the roots, to the essence.... Only 
the most slow-witted resisted the obvious. 
  [Odnokolenko] Consequently we should not be surprised that 
it was from the military-political academy and other political 
and humanitarian higher educational establishments that there 
emerged people who were the first to criticize their own 
convictions? 
  [Yushenkov] Take the church. In which milieu did heresy 
first arise? Among the adepts of religion. There is nothing 
surprising in that. Who could know the true situation better 
than "its own people?" 
  [Odnokolenko] Nonetheless, when, at what time, did you 
finally burn your bridges, so to speak, and switch to the 
democratic camp? 
  [Yushenkov] In about 1987, after I had defended my 
dissertation, I began to engage actively in a study of the 
informal movement in the country. Just in case I thought up a 
"cover" for myself -- I said I was collecting material for my 
doctor's thesis. But in fact I was meeting with likeminded 
people and testing the accuracy of my views. 
  [Odnokolenko] Which democratic leader of the time most 
influenced your views? 
  [Yushenkov] I am not one of those whose convictions can 
easily be influenced. I have never blindly followed any 
authority. Most often I made decisions for myself and made my 
way independently. Not under anyone's influence but under the 
influence of the conditions which had actually taken shape in 
the country. 
  But of course there was some influence. But not only 
personal. Do you remember what items were published at the time 
in newspapers and journals? How many disputes there were? Even 
the academy named for Lenin resembled a beehive that had been 
stirred up.... 
  [Odnokolenko] Now all that is in the past. Big changes have 
occurred in your fate -- you have become chairman of the State 
Duma defense committee. Incidentally, how do you see the 
defense committee in this scenario? 
  [Yushenkov] It seems to me that this is one of the 
committees in which an excessively politicized nature should not 
predominate. First of all the defense committee should accord 
with its main function -- being concerned for the legal backup 
for the country's defense and legislative guarantees for the 
rights of servicemen and their families. Naturally the approval 
of the defense budget is also the committee's responsibility. 
That is perhaps the main thing right now. 
  [Odnokolenko] What is the disposition of political forces in 
the committee right now? 
  [Yushenkov] The committee has been joined by representatives 
of the Liberal Democratic Party, "Russia's Choice," the 
Communist Party, the Agrarian Party, "Women of Russia," and so 
forth. But to judge from the first sessions I hope that such a 
broad spectrum of political priorities will not have an adverse 
effect on our work. Since, as we can already see, everyone is 
well aware that defense should not be the subject of political 
disputes. 
  [Odnokolenko] What about the legacy bequeathed to us from 
the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet committee for questions of 
defense and security? Will it be suitable? 
  [Yushenkov] We treat with respect the activity of our 
predecessors and will try to retain continuity. Especially as 
Aleksandr Piskunov, who was deputy chairman in the former 
committee, has become my deputy. In brief, the good things 
worked out by our predecessors will be retained without fail. 
And the developments which they did not manage to implement and 
which are of value we shall try to implement, but with regard to 
the new conditions. 
  [Odnokolenko] But on the other hand not all legislative 
acts on military questions which your predecessors launched have 
proved workable. 
  [Yushenkov] That is true. So one of our priority tasks is 
to carry out an "inventory" of all laws, to investigate which 
articles are not working, and to decide what to do: Whether to 
back up these articles with the relevant life support mechanism 
or whether to alter them. It is entirely possible that they 
were adopted as it were in the abstract, in isolation from 
reality. In brief, we must investigate. 
  [Odnokolenko] I realize the question is probably premature, 
but anyway: Perhaps the present defense committee already has 
its own legislative proposals? 
  [Yushenkov] Yes, it does have such proposals. They are 
mainly connected with putting a more thorough legal basis under 
the reform of the Army. 
  [Odnokolenko] So much is said about the Army, and what is 
said is so diverse, that it is time to specify what content you 
personally put into this term? 
  [Yushenkov] The Army should become a professional army. 
That is already axiomatic. But the Army's transition to a 
professional basis should be implemented with a consideration 
for the real economic situation. Otherwise we will simply fail 
and our plans will remain only plans. 
  [Odnokolenko] As far as I remember, previously parliament 
did not always find a common language with the Defense Ministry. 
It was particularly difficult at first. Now everything is 
starting from the beginning.... 
  [Yushenkov] Life is a complex thing and the future will show 
how our relations with the military department take shape. But 
the fact that from the very first sessions of the committee they 
have been attended by a Defense Ministry representative instills 
the confidence and hope that there will be productive 
collaboration, and we do not want it any other way. It is 
simply mad to work any other way. 
  [Odnokolenko] Yes, but in my opinion the problem is more 
complex. After all, you will have to check your positions not 
only with the Defense Ministry but also with specific state 
structures. Moreover, you will have to take someone's side on 
vexed issues. 
  [Yushenkov] In my view the parliamentary defense committee 
should not be a kind of lobbying instrument for the Armed 
Forces. But nor are we opponents of the military department. 
We have a common interest -- the country's defense capability. 
Therefore, I stress once again, in reality we have one path 
left -- the path of agreement and collaboration. Which, 
incidentally, does not rule out and in no way impedes the 
separation of functions. 
  [Odnokolenko] Although our talk has not been on an economic 
subject, we can hardly avoid this problem. Why do you believe 
the democrats have not managed to completely fulfill their 
economic commitments to society? 
  [Yushenkov] That is the eternal problem of the failure of 
aims and the results of activity to coincide. If everything 
were to coincide ideally there would be no problem. But that is 
never what happens. 
  [Odnokolenko] But perhaps it has all come out this way 
because the democrats lacked cohesion and purpose? For 
instance, when they came to power the bolsheviks -- unless, of 
course, the sources lie -- worked more harmoniously and 
selflessly. 
  [Yushenkov] That is probably not the point. The democrats 
in general do not know how to wield power. That is both their 
merit and their shortcoming. It was not for nothing that 
Churchill said that democracy is the worst form of government 
but man has not yet thought up anything better. 
  That means there is one thing left -- we must learn how to 
govern.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Kovalev, Russian Federation Human </F>
Rights Commissioner, by Andrey Sharapov; place and date not 
given, under the rubric "At the State Duma": "Vocation -- 
Defender of the People"] 
  [Text] The office of the people's representative or, as it 
is now known throughout the world, the "ombudsman," was 
introduced in Scandinavia at the end of the last century and in 
other countries after that. The ombudsman is empowered to 
examine complaints by citizens and formulate recommendations for 
the resolution of disputes. In the context of Russia's law 
reform the State Duma has appointed Sergey Kovalev, the well 
known defender of rights, to be the Russian Federation 
commissioner for human rights. 
  From our files. Sergey Adamovich Kovalev was born in 1930. 
He graduated from Moscow State University's Biology Department 
in 1954, is a specialist in cell membranes, and has published 
around 70 scientific works. He began his public activity with 
the defense of genetics and articles against Lysenko's 
doctrines. He was an active participant in the dissident 
movement in the sixties and seventies. In 1974 he was sentenced 
to seven years for political activity and after serving that 
sentence he was exiled to Kolyma for three years and spent the 
following three years under surveillance in Kalinin. In 1990 he 
became a Russian Federation people's deputy and chairman of the 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Human Rights Committee. He is 
now chairman of the Russian President's Human Rights Commission 
on a voluntary basis. 
  [Kovalev] It is very important that the ombudsman or the 
commissioner for human rights, as it says in the new Russian 
Federation Constitution, has no executive powers [vlastnyye 
polnomochiya]. However, state organs are obliged to examine his 
recommendations on complaints of human rights violations. The 
prestige of this service derives from the thoroughness of its 
investigation and the well balanced nature of its conclusions. 
Perhaps the only element which needs to be introduced into the 
law to enhance the effectiveness of our work is a norm on the 
right to publish our recommendations and the obligation of state 
institutions to give a public explanation of their response if 
they disagree with our conclusions. This guarantee of publicity 
will help society to understand the most complex conflicts 
between people and the state. 
  The new service is designed to protect human rights 
primarily 
against the state in the form of a specific official or a whole 
department. It is not a rival to the court or the prosecutor's 
office. The philosophy of this institution is to seek peaceful 
solutions in disputes between the citizen and the state, the 
gradual development of relations of trust between them, and 
accordingly the enhancement of the prestige of the agency 
[vlast] which has been created to guarantee the rights of the 
individual. I believe that for Russia the introduction of the 
service of the people's defender is especially timely. 
  [Sharapov] Might it not be that there will be an endless 
stream of complainants coming to you as they used to go and see 
"Kalinin, the sage of all the people"? 
  [Kovalev] That is inevitable although there are various 
devices to filter such streams. One, which I admit I do not 
like very much, is that of exhausting the other means first, in 
other words, this service is the court of last resort when all 
the others have been tried. I believe that given our 
bureaucracy this is not the best way. The urgency and social 
significance of the dispute may be important criteria although 
such parameters are difficult to formalize. 
  In some countries there are "specialist ombudsmen" on 
ecology, army matters, and so forth. Perhaps such a system will 
one day take root in Russia, too. However, it is important to 
understand that human rights are a federal prerogative and the 
commissioner for human rights must operate at federal level. 
You will agree that it would be absurd if there were different 
norms in this sphere in the different oblasts of Russia with 
each demanding its own ombudsman. However, this does not mean 
that in the Russian regions there will be no representatives of 
the service of the commissioner for human rights. 
  [Sharapov] Is it really the case that anyone who has a 
grievance against the authorities, including people in detention 
centers, can appeal to you? 
  [Kovalev] Prisoners traditionally form a considerable 
proportion of those who appeal for justice. It goes without 
saying that all statements will be examined. I believe that if 
the essence of a case is set out clearly and concisely all the 
necessary papers will be demanded when our service examines the 
case. 
  There are extensive areas of human rights which still seem 
to 
be in the shadows as far as social consciousness is concerned. 
For example, the rights of Russian citizens outside its 
borders. Our Human Rights Commission together with the Foreign 
Ministry is now drafting proposals to resolve this problem. 
There are sometimes the most unexpected clashes in the human 
rights sphere. For example, one Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet budget virtually empowered local organs of power to levy 
a payment for education on citizens leaving Russia. The Russian 
Federation Supreme Soviet Human Rights Committee had simply 
overlooked this little gem which is contrary to all 
international norms. I think that the Russian Federation human 
rights cpmmissioner's service will consider the whole range of 
problems of the protection of rights in Russia. 
  [Sharapov] But for work to begin it seems that the State 
Duma must adopt a law on the service of the Russian Federation 
commissioner for human rights? 
  [Kovalev] Yes, and this would be a constitutional law 
needing the vote of two-thirds of the deputies for adoption. 
The ratification of the office of the human rights commissioner 
by the country's representative organ emphasizes the origin of 
this office which, I repeat, is independent of the authorities. 
The president can and must have consultants in the human rights 
sphere although our service is designed primarily to protect 
people from abuses by state officials or structures. Of course 
the office of the human rights commissioner presupposes the 
cessation of party and other political activity, especially 
activity as a deputy. 
  The situation in the Duma today is complex and it will not 
be 
easy to get the law through. However, the factional structure 
of the Duma may make it possible and already is making it 
possible to reach agreement on the most diverse questions. I 
hope that this factor, together with the ombudsman's lack of 
executive powers, will reconcile deputies. Especially since 
they are the people's representatives and our service is 
designed to protect the rights of the people.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Leonid Kalashnikov: "Kyrgyzstan: </F>
Passions Around Dual Citizenship"] 
  [Text] Kyrgyz Republic -- It is by no means the heated 
disputes of deputies at the recent parliament session on the 
republic's budget nor even the long debates on the new coat of 
arms which have been the main topic for January in Kyrgyzstan's 
political life, but the idea of dual citizenship and whether or 
not to introduce it. That is where passions are seething! 
  The whole point is that the draft agreement on dual 
citizenship was prepared by the Russian side and conveyed 
through the Russian Embassy in Kyrgyzstan to the republic's 
president and government. Later there was Askar Akayev's New 
Year address to the people, his interviews with newspapers, and 
speeches in which he noted that dual citizenship "will be useful 
to both sides and will introduce a new spirit of trust, 
cooperation, and fraternity to relations between the two peoples 
-- Russian and Kyrgyz." And most importantly it will work like 
a dam in the path of the stream of the Russian-speaking 
population leaving the republic. After all, last year alone, 
according to the Slav foundation, over 100,000 Russian speakers, 
as almost all inhabitants of nonindigenous nationality are now 
called here, left Kyrgyzstan. And those who left were primarily 
skilled national economy specialists, doctors, teachers, and 
engineers. 
  The republic's president is concerned. Measures are being 
urgently elaborated in the government to halt this destructive 
flow. But the process has begun, as the saying goes. And, 
unfortunately, it is being accelerated by several political 
parties defending so-called "national resurrection." Closing 
their eyes to the obvious advantages of dual citizenship both 
for Russians and for the Kyrgyz, not only, for instance, in the 
stabilization of the situation in the republic but also in the 
sphere of science, education, and so forth, they have rallied on 
one salient -- preventing the signing of this agreement. The 
fiercest attacks on Askar Akayev come from the headquarters of 
the "Asaba" national resurrection party. Its central council 
has stated categorically and without beating about the bush: 
"The introduction of dual citizenship is a threat not only to 
the sovereignty of the Kyrgyz state but also to the very 
existence of the Kyrgyz nation." 
  But sober politicians who have preserved a spirit of 
internationalism do not think that way at all. Here is the 
opinion of Feliks Sharshenbayevich Kulov, a hero of August 1991 
in Kyrgyzstan, vice president, and now head of the 
administration of Chuyskaya Oblast, the largest in the republic: 
  "I hope no one can accuse me of lacking patriotism, and I 
hope it does not seem immodest, but my actions have spoken 
louder than any words.... I unconditionally support the idea of 
dual citizenship since it serves primarily the interests of the 
Kyrgyz nation and could become the foundation of our state's 
security." 
  An interview with Chingiz Aytmatov appeared in VECHERNIY 
BISHKEK at just the right time. Considering Russian culture and 
its influence on him as an Asian man, the writer simply and 
clearly told his fellow citizens as if for their edification: 
  "How blind are those who call for national self-isolation, 
speaking of national exclusiveness. That road is a dead end. I 
think Kyrgyz culture should in no circumstances separate itself 
from Russian culture, from the Russian language which opened the 
way for the Kyrgyz people into world culture." 
  Whether or not there is to be dual citizenship will most 
likely be decided in the next few days. Optimists, and there 
are many of them among sober Kyrgyz politicians, believe that 
Askar Akayev will embark on such an interstate agreement between 
Russia and Kyrgyzstan after victory at the referendum.

  [Text] Estonian Minister of Defence Indrek Kannik, after 
meeting NATO mission currently visiting Estonia, told a press 
conference that Estonia's main interest in the Partnership for 
Peace programme, signed by Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Juri Luik in Brussels, on Thursday [3 February], lied in a 
possibility of having joint political discussions with states 
included in the programme, joint training programmes of the 
military and participation in joint military exercises. 
  Kannik stressed the fact that the obligation taken by NATO 
in 
the initiative to hold consultations with new partners was 
"especially important for Estonia because of a possible 
political crisis in the near neighbourhood". 
  "Estonian Government considers Partnership for Peace a 
positive programme and a great step ahead. We understand that 
it is a part of a process of becoming a full member of NATO," 
Kannik said. 
  Head of the NATO mission, permanent representative of 
Germany 
in NATO Hermann F. von Richthofen told the press conference that 
as NATO was not a closed system, no obstacles were laid to any 
states in joining it, adding, however, that participation in the 
Partnership for Peace programme did not mean a soon membership 
of NATO, but was still a step towards wider and closer 
cooperation. 
  Kannik said that in the report to be made to NATO as to the 
Estonian standpoints on aims of the Partnership for Peace 
programme and means necessary to participate in the programme, 
Estonia will make a proposition to hold a part of the joint 
exercises of the Partnership for Peace programme in Estonia to 
reduce cost of participation in the programme. At the same time 
NATO aid to founding the Baltic peacekeeping battalion was not 
out of question, he added.

  [Text] A team of NATO officials sent to determine to what 
extent Estonia was prepared to join the Partnership for Peace 
program has ended its visit there. 
  Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik said at a news 
conference Thursday that the mission members discussed with 
Estonian officials ways to step up the country's cooperation 
with NATO, in particular the setting up of a consulting 
mechanism which would work in crisis situations, joint military 
exercises and training of Estonian officers. They also 
discussed what Estonia could offer NATO. 
  Hermann von Richthoff, the mission head, emphasized that 
Partnership for Peace was not hostile to any country. He said 
that joint exercises with NATO could be staged in Estonia in 
1993 [as received]. 
  General K.-T. Steinkopf, a mission member, said that NATO 
could not sell weapons to countries that were not its members 
but Baltic states could buy them from NATO members in bilateral 
deals. 
  The NATO team has left for Latvia from where it will go on 
to 
Ukraine and Moldova.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 03, BNS -- The CSCE mission to Estonia 
denied the accusations that its reports misinform the world 
community about the situation in Estonia. 
  The Estonian Human Rights Institute accused the mission last 
Monday [31 January] of using premises that contradict 
international law and inaccurate data as the basis of its 
official reports. 
  The Institute based its accusations among other things on 
the 
mission's activity report No.46 of Jan. 10, which is based on 
the point of view that the Estonian state came into being after 
the Soviet Union disintegrated and thus fails to recognize the 
state's continuity. As a result, the responsibility for 
citizens of the former Soviet Union, who immigrated into Estonia 
during the occupation period, is laid on Estonia. 
  The CSCE mission to Estonia in a statement released on 
Thursday in Tallinn says that the No. 46 report of the mission 
"says nothing of the kind". 
  "The mission supports the Estonian Government's freedom to 
determine the requirements for Estonian citizenship and makes a 
clear distinction between the status of the Baltic states and 
that of the CIS," the mission writes. 
  In its' Thursday's statement the mission notes that the No. 
46 report "favoured prompt implementation of Estonian's law on 
aliens and supported the right of all persons, regardless of 
nationality, to leave the country legally". 
  The mission also states, that the Russian affairs are 
outside 
of its mandate, since the mission is authorized to examine only 
the situation in Estonia. The Estonian Human Rights Institute 
said on Monday that the CSCE mission "failed to take notice" of 
the human rights' violations in CIS and "the aggressive 
nationalism" of Russia.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 03, BNS -- Officials from the Estonian 
Defense Police visited the home of Pyotr Rozhok, the 
representative of the ultra-nationalist Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party in Estonia, after Rozhok refused to appear 
before Defense Police investigators in Tallinn. 
  A detective had a conversation with Rozhok in the latter's 
apartment. 
  The head of the Estonian security police, Juri Pihl, has 
earlier said his department had no reasons to implement any 
measures against Rozhok, as the man had committed no concrete 
action against the Estonian State. 
  Rozhok says he received a formal order to appear in the 
office of the Estonian Defense Police in Tallinn on Jan. 24. He 
said he had refused to go because his appearing before Estonian 
investigators had not been agreed upon with the Russian embassy 
in Tallinn. 
  The representative of Zhirinovsky's party says he received 
another call from a defense police official on Jan. 25. The 
official, who had identified himself as detective Sergei Melnik, 
had used expressions of "threat and blackmail" while speaking to 
Rozhok on the phone, Rozhok said. 
  Rozhok also said he had delivered all publications in the 
Estonian press concerning his activity in the country to the 
Liberal Democratic Party faction in the Russian parliament. 
  Rozhok said Estonian security police officials had later 
appeared in the place where he works. He claims the country's 
security police had "worked out a number of schemes" for his 
arrest. 
  "As long as violation of the rights of Russians and 
exploitation of the Russians' labor continues in Estonia, also 
my political activity toward the protection of their rights will 
continue," he said. He also claimed that ninety-nine percent of 
the reports published on him in the Estonian press were "a lie, 
intertwined with threat and blackmail."

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 02, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas said he is very concerned that trained 
specialists are moving to private structures and thus weaken the 
scientific potential of research institutes and institutions of 
higher education. 
  Speaking at the annual Lithuanian Science and Industry 
conference in Kaunas Tuesday [1 February], the president 
emphasized the need to preserve the remaining scientific nucleus 
and to train new specialists for the country. 
  Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius admitted in his report 
that the state is unable to maintain all scientific personnel. 
  The number of scientific personnel decreased by nearly 30 
percent over the past three years, but, in the premier's view, 
the country's higher education institutions do not experience a 
shortage of specialists yet. 
  The four-day conference in Kaunas will try to find solutions 
to problems of developing Lithuanian science and will search for 
a way out a crisis that was caused by the worsening economic 
situation. The conference is attended by members of the 
government, university rectors and scholars.

  [Text] VILNIUS, Feb 03, BNS - Skeptical and negative 
attitudes toward Lithuanian economic reforms have completely 
vanished, Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said, 
commenting on the World Economic Forum that was held in the 
Swiss town of Davos last week. 
  At a press conference Thursday, Slezevicius said Lithuania's 
macroeconomic indexes started to approach Czech, Hungarian, 
Slovakian, Polish, Estonian and Latvian ones. The rate of 
inflation is the principal index, and "Lithuania is no longer 
considered a country with an average [as received] rate of 
inflation," he said. 
  Discussing his meetings in Davos, Slezevicius pointed out 
the 
meetings with Baltic and Scandinavian leaders. He said Swedish 
Prime Minister Carl Bildt invited the Baltic premiers for a 
meeting with their Nordic counterparts in early March. 
  As regards the way Latvian and Estonian premiers assessed 
the 
Davos meeting, Slezevicius said he is unwilling to make any 
critical remarks on any statements by Lithuania's neighbors. 
Slezevicius said there were no discussions in Davos "purely 
about Estonia" or that Lithuania's economy depends on Russia. 
  But the Lithuanian premier admitted that Estonia does not 
depend on Russia as much as Lithuania. In his opinion, this is 
so only because Estonia gets around 65 percent of its energy 
from local shale, while Lithuania has to buy Russian oil and 
nuclear fuel. 
  Commenting on relations with Russia, which were on of the 
key 
issues in Davos, Slezevicius said Lithuania is unable to 
establish a normal dialog with Russia and to solve a number of 
problems. The premier said the Lithuanian government tries to 
arrange a meeting with Russian leaders, but all attempts have 
failed so far. "I have asked several times to speak to Mr. 
Chernomyrdin, but the instable situation in Russia really stops 
us." 
  The Lithuanian premier said the dialog with Poland and 
Belarus, on such problems as border delimitation, is very 
difficult, as well.

  [Text] Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius told 
INTERFAX on Thursday that he is not satisfied with the latest 
relations with Russia. 
  In particular, the premier said, immediately after signing 
the treaty on most favored trading status with Russia a few 
months ago the Lithuanian side sent a note to Moscow. However, 
the Russian side has not yet responded, so the treaty cannot 
come into force. 
  Referring to unofficial reports, the premier said that the 
Russian side is trying to link these issues with other problems, 
in particular with "some aspects of relations between Lithuania 
and the Kaliningrad region of Russia."

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 03, BNS -- A KGB agent works at the 
Lithuanian Ministry of Defense, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper 
said Thursday [3 February]. 
  The newspaper said the agent, known as Gnat, currently holds 
a high-ranking post in the ministry. He is reportedly a former 
activist of the Sajudis popular front and was awarded for 
defending the parliament and other state institutions during the 
Soviet military aggression in 1991. 
  LIETUVOS RYTAS implied that the pseudonym Gnat is used for 
Ignas Stankovicius, director of the ministry's International and 
Internal Relations Division. 
  There has been no immediate reaction from the leadership of 
national defense. The ministry's press service said 
Stankovicius is currently on vacation due to health problems. 
  Stankovicius, formerly an employee of the Physicotechnical 
Institute and regional environmental protection inspector, made 
a career leap to the rank of colonel in structures of national 
defense. 
  In the summer of 1990, Stankovicius was appointed as the 
assistant director of the then Department of Defense, but his 
further career was interrupted by then Prime Minister Gediminas 
Vagnorius, who dismissed Stankovicius for "neglect of duties, 
disregarding property and the basic needs of soldiers and 
officers." 
  But LIETUVOS RYTAS noted that soon before Stankovicius left 
the post, the leadership of national defense and the 
parliament's National Security Committee were informed by an 
anonymous "former KGB colonel" that KGB agent Gnat works in the 
system of defense. 
  Stankovicius returned to the Ministry of Defense in January 
1992. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in early 1993.

  [Text] The U.S. believes that Latvia and Russia must 
conclude an agreement on the operation of radar in the village 
of Skrunda and on the term of its utilization by Russia, says 
the press release highlighting the results of the visit to 
Washington by a Latvian delegation led by Latvian Foreign 
Minister Georgs Andrejevs. 
  Among the Russia-advanced terms for the withdrawal of about 
13,000 Russian servicemen from Latvia by August 31, 1994, is 
holding on to the early-warning radar during the next five 
years. Latvia has agreed to 3 years and to the radar's 
dismantling during one more year. The absence of compromise is 
the stumbling block hampering the bilateral talks. 
  The press release also says that in the U.S. Latvian 
deputies 
and diplomats met with President Bill Clinton, Vice President 
Albert Gore, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
Under-Secretary of State Strobe Talbott [title as received], and 
representatives of the National Security Council, the Pentagon 
and other officials. 
  The talks concentrated on the Latvian-Russian talks, on 
Latvia's participation in the Partnership for Peace program, on 
European security and on ways of broadening military cooperation 
between Latvia and the U.S..

  [Text] A delegation from the Latvian Saeima, consisting of 
representatives of all the groups, has returned from a visit to 
the United States of America. Deputy Andrejs Pantelejevs today 
told a news conference that the aim of the visit was to discuss 
the issues of Latvian national security. 
  The delegation was also received by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. It became 
clear during the talks that the United States of America viewed 
the withdrawal of the Russian Army not only as Latvia's internal 
issue, but rather as a problem of all-European and American 
security systems. 
  One of the most complicated issues is the fate of the 
Skrunda 
radar station. Russia has expressed the wish to use it for 
another four years and after that, it will scrap it within 18 
months. In that case, Russia would withdraw all the troops from 
Latvia by 31 August this year. That is the best option which 
Latvia would have to accept, said Deputy Jevgenijs Zoscerinskis. 
Such a compromise would satisfy all the European countries. 
  Deputy Maris Grinblats for his part assessed the results of 
the visit very briefly -- they tried to persuade us that the 
world would be glad if we give in on this issue.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 03, BNS -- The signature of a 
Latvian-Russian agreement on troops' withdrawal will entitle 
Latvia to receive international security guarantees from the 
United States and European countries, Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs told reporters Thursday [3 February]. 
  The United States pledges to send Latvia internationally 
recognized experts to monitor the agreement's implementation, 
said Saeima (parliament) Foreign Committee head Alexander 
Kirsteins. 
  Latvia's Way's Andrejs Pantelejevs underlined that Latvian 
security was important not only to his country but also to 
American and European security, judging by the results of this 
week's meetings in Washington. 
  The U.S. Government confirmed its interestedness in the 
conclusion of a formal agreement between Latvia and Russia on 
the withdrawal of the Russian troops and the dismantling of the 
Skrunda radar station. 
  The Russian Government promised the United States to get the 
remaining troops out of Latvia until the end of August on 
condition Latvia allows it retain the Skrunda radar for four 
years and 18 months. 
  If Latvia rejects the term and follows its own way to reach 
an accord with Russia, the United States declines to extend any 
subsequent security guarantees. 
  Latvia, however, will accept the proposal only if the new 
building of the Skrunda early-warning antimissile installation 
will be pulled down immediately, said Pantelejevs. 
  The United States supports Latvia's signature to NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program and will help Latvia with 
technical provisions, Kirsteins said. 
  The Latvian delegation met with President Bill Clinton, 
State 
Secretary Warren Christopher, Deputy State Secretary Strobe 
Talbott and Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry.

  [Text] [Announcer] State President Guntis Ulmanis and Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs today sent a letter to NATO concerning 
Latvia's wish to join the Partnership for Peace program. 
  At a news conference Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs stressed 
that joining this program is one more step in implementing the 
number one priority of the state -- security policy. The 
security and defense policy is currently being implemented in 
Latvia in three main aspects. 
  [Begin Birkavs recording] One is the budget intended for 
defense and security structures. Compared with the past year, 
it has been increased by 57 percent; obviously it is not enough. 
  The second step in that direction is the talks that we have 
begun to also use credits for strengthening our armament. We 
need international guarantees. We have to interweave into the 
European context with all our structures. And the Partnership 
for Peace, this initiative, is the one that gives us new 
opportunities. But I would like to say that that is not a 
security market, on which everyone buys his security, but rather 
that it is an opportunity for a state to achieve gradual 
approach to NATO structures in talks with NATO. That is a 
vehicle that will allow us in the event of a crisis to obtain 
consultations and thus react correctly to specific crises. This 
will require a great deal of strength, this will also require 
additional funds, but this has to be done, because otherwise we 
may lose all that we have achieved. 
  According to the Partnership for Peace, each state can set 
up 
its own communication bureau in Brussels with NATO Headquarters. 
So then, I consider that we will need a person who would be 
specifically oriented toward cooperation with NATO so that we 
can actively participate in the creation of the NATO partnership. 
  The 14th clause of the declaration, Partnership for Peace, 
reads: NATO will provide consultations for each active 
participant in the partnership in the event that they feel 
direct threats to their territorial integrity, political 
sovereignty, or security. 
  So then, a simple passive statement will not be enough and 
we 
are oriented toward active participation in this process. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] It is envisaged that Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs will sign a document on Latvia joining the Partnership 
for Peace program in Brussels as early as next week.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 03, BNS -- British ex-Premier Margaret 
Thatcher voiced her support to the economic, administrative and 
court reforms in Latvia, Latvian Economics Minister Ojars Kehris 
told reporters Wednesday [2 February]. 
  Kehris commented on the results of the Baltic conference in 
London and the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
  Latvia should reduce the state influence on economy and 
increase the role of private structures in the process of 
transfer to a market economy, Thatcher told Kehris. 
  Thatcher pledged to help Latvia to join international 
finance 
institutions what could also foster the economic development. 
She also accepted an invitation to visit Latvia, Kehris said. 
  In addition, Kehris met with representatives of the Cable 
&amp; 
Wireless firm, which together with the Telecom Finland won the 
right to modernize the Latvian telecommunication system. 
  Cable &amp; Wireless has made a commitment to make a major 
capital investment into the joint venture and help train 
qualified marketing specialists in Latvia. 
  The safety of British investments in Latvia is guaranteed by 
the bilateral treaty on the protection and promotion of 
investments, signed during the conference, Kehris said. 
  Speaking on politics, Kehris said that British officials 
denounced Russian Defense Minister Andrei Kozyrev's statement 
that placed Latvia in the sphere of Russia's vital interests. 
  Kehris also acquainted reporters with the conclusions of the 
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
  Latvia should look for economic contacts with Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, Ukraine and other eastern countries because 
consultations with these countries' envoys to the forum 
evidenced of their wish to cooperate with Latvia. 
  Russian delegates, for example, offered Latvia a market for 
farm produce in St. Petersburg, Kehris said. The deal could 
ensure a stable market for Latvian farm products through a 
couple of years, he said. 
  Kehris plans to travel to Kazakhstan and Ukraine soon to 
discuss economic cooperation. 
  On the other hand, Latvia needs the Western help to 
encourage 
export of local goods and "freely enter into the world market," 
said Kehris. 
  The world leaders fear that the already rampant inflation in 
Russia may rise out of control, Kehris said. Hyperinflation in 
Russia may provoke unpredictable consequences on the world 
economy, he said.

  [Text] Azerbaijan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Gasan 
Gasanov gave a news conference today on the results of his talks 
with Vladimir Kazimirov, special envoy of the Russian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. Before the talks, Kazimirov visited Armenia 
and Nagorno-Karabakh with a new Russian peace initiative on the 
Karabakh conflict. Yesterday, our correspondent Islam Kuliyev 
asked Gasan Gasanov to explain this especially for Mayak 
Panorama listeners. 
  [Begin recording] [Kuliyev] Gasan Azizovich, several days 
have passed since your talks with the Russian president's 
personal envoy, Vladimir Kazimirov, but unfortunately we have 
not yet received exhaustive information about the fate of the 
new peace initiative proposed by the Russian side. Could you 
please tell us about this in more detail? 
  [Gasanov] In fact, what one means by the Russian initiative 
is an initiative on settling this conflict by peaceful political 
methods. In this respect we totally and fully support the 
Russian initiative and believe that Russia must, without fail, 
participate in this settlement process. The point is that in 
addition to this overall settlement process, Kazimirov also had 
the idea that a ceasefire should be concluded immediately. 
  We gave our consent to Azerbaijan and Armenia urgently 
concluding a truce on a cease-fire. [sentence as heard] 
Azerbaijan was even willing not to place any terms on the 
cease-fire. However, the Armenian side set the condition that 
Nagorno-Karabakh should also sign this, as an equal partner. 
For Nagorno-Karabakh to sign as an equal partner would, in 
practice, have meant that they were, so to speak, a third party 
in this conflict even though they are not an equal third party. 
We very much regret the failure to persuade the Republic of 
Armenia to sign a cease-fire agreement with us. 
  [Kuliyev] As you see it, is there a chance that they might 
agree to the Armenian community in Nagorno-Karabakh playing some 
part in this whole talks process? 
  [Gasanov] That is precisely how we understand it, namely 
that 
Nagorno-Karabakh has two communities -- the Azerbaijani 
community and the Armenian. Of the 150,000 population living in 
Nagorno-Karabakh, 100,000 are Armenians and 50,000 are 
Azerbaijanis. The Republic of Armenia totally ignores the 
rights of the 50,000 Azerbaijanis of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  [Kuliyev] How do you see this conflict developing in the 
future? 
  [Gasanov] I see only one path, the path of a peaceful 
political settlement. We need to sit down at the negotiation 
table and to talk and talk and talk and not to expect instant 
results from these talks. We reckon on them being long-term but 
successful talks. Moreover, of course, I do not rule out the 
possibility that when we do sit down at the negotiation table, 
the Armenians will realize that talking from their position of 
strength does not have the effect it used to. And and having 
realized that it is not as effective to speak from a position of 
strength as it used to be, they will probably behave more 
realistically at the negotiation table. [end recording]

  [Text] Baku, February 3 (TURAN) -- Tofik Zulfugarov, the 
chief of the Division for the Conflicts and Political Regulation 
of the Armenian-Azeri Conflict, attached to the Azeri Foreign 
Ministry said at the press conference in Baku today "Azerbaijani 
side possesses numerous facts, including the testimonies of the 
Armenian officers taken prisoners in Kelbadzharshiy region 
recently proving the direct participation of the military units 
of the Republic of Armenia in fightings against the Azeri army 
in Karabakh and around [it]. Moreover, the documents and maps 
with instructions, withdrawn from the prisoners of war testify 
that all the operations are being worked out by the General 
Staff of the Armenian Republic. So, there is an armed conflict 
exactly between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  Touching upon the problem of regulation of the conflict T. 
Zulfugarov said that the recent visit of the Special Russian 
Envoy Kazimirov to Baku was concerning the signing of cease-fire 
agreement. As Tofik Zulfugarov said "Azerbaijan stands for the 
political regulation of the conflict and is ready to cease 
hostilities in order to assist solving the problem. But we 
insist that the cease-fire agreement is signed between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan as they are the parties to the conflict." Mr. 
Zulfugarov said that Armenia says it is "responsible only for 
the situation on the Armenian-Azeri border, but the cease-fire 
agreement have to be signed between Azerbaijan and 
Nagorno-Karabakh." "So, Armenia's conditions are directed at 
attaching the Nagorno-Karabakh status of the party to the 
conflict, and in perspective -- an independent party at the 
talks. We cannot agree to this," T. Zulfugarov said. 
  Zulfugarov said that for the destructive position of Armenia 
the meeting between Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev did not take place. 
  Zulfugarov also said that the documents, testifying the 
participation of the Armenian Army in the aggression against 
Azerbaijan are sent to the UNO [United Nations Organization] 
Secretary General, to the CSCE Secretariat, NATO secretary 
general, European Soviet [Council of Europe] and a number of 
international organizations. "Our position is clear, 
constructive and has elements of compromise", Zulfugarov said.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev has talked to 
Turkish reporters in Baku before his visit to Turkey. He said 
that Azerbaijan want peace but that the first and foremost 
condition is that Armenia withdraw from the Azerbaijani 
territory it has occupied. Pointing out that the Russian 
proposal for an immediate cease-fire was rejected because this 
condition had not been met, Aliyev stressed that Azerbaijan 
definitely wants Turkey to participate in the peacekeeping force 
Russia intends to station in Karabakh. Recalling that he will 
be making an official visit to Turkey as the guest of President 
Suleyman Demirel between 8 and 11 February, Aliyev added that 
this visit will constitute a stepping stone to further develop 
the existing bilateral relations. He noted that he will be 
conducting talks on all issues with Turkey and that the 
Ceyhan-Baku oil pipeline issue will also be taken up.

<F P=106> [Tunzale Kasumova report: "Cars Blown to Smithereens"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- Train No. 660, which was standing at a 
platform in Baku Railroad Station, was blown up at 2247 hours 
yesterday. Three people died, and seven were injured. 
  If the explosion had happened some 20 minutes earlier or 
later, the scale of the tragedy would have been more 
considerable. By a lucky chance, however, by the time the 
delayed-action mine placed in the second car went off, the 
passengers who had just arrived on this train from Kislovodsk 
had already got off and all those who were to set out in it for 
Astara at 2307 hours had not yet had time to get on. 
Nevertheless, material damage (considerable damage!) was 
caused: In addition to the two cars blown to smithereens, 
windows were blown out in the nearby Baku-Tbilisi and Baku-Ganja 
trains. 
  A. Bagirov, the republic's transport prosecutor, has said 
that an investigation has started. "This is not the first act 
of terrorism," he remarked. "Whereas in previous instances we 
were dealing with explosive devices with a clockwork mechanism 
restricting their operating time to 12 hours, a mine has now 
been used which, thanks to special chemical fillers, can be set 
off two or three days after being put in position."

  [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev said that 
secession of North Caucasus from Russia was a real threat. He 
emphasized in an interview with INTERFAX that this was likely to 
happen unless Russia ceased to use force and blackmail and 
started to use diplomacy and negotiations in its relations with 
the mountain nations. 
  He thinks that Russia is encouraged in its ill-conceived 
North Caucasian policy by "certain quarters in the West who want 
Russia to disintegrate and lose statehood." 
  Dudayev believes that the abundance of weapons and 
uncontrolled militias had contributed to making the region 
unmanageable. This situation affects Russia itself. 
  He said that "weapons are moving from the Caucasus into the 
depths of Russia where armed fascist and nationalist bands are 
formed." 
  In Dudayev's view, "this complicated situation is likely to 
aggravate, making a new Caucasian war possible. Those in the 
Russian leadership who play into the hands of the West and lead 
Russia to a collapse while making a lot of noise about keeping 
it united and indivisible have a significant role to play in 
this process." 
  He said that Chechnya was prepared to look, jointly with 
Russia, for ways to stabilize the Caucasus.

  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The Siberian city of 
Yakutsk is heavily guarded on Friday as an ultimatum to explode 
its major infrastructure facilites received from an unknown 
terrorist group expires. 
  A group called "Retribution", of which nobody had ever heard 
in Yakutsk, demanded to be paid 500,000 US dollars and 500 
million rubles threatening to explode life-supporting facilities 
of the city. 
  The Russian Interior Ministry told TASS that police in 
Yakutsk believe the threat is just a bluff; however, army 
experts joined police in a search for explosives. Special 
headquarters were created to monitor the situation and 
reinforced police units are patrolling the city. 
  Everything was quiet in Yakutsk as for 18.00 hours local 
time, Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov told TASS by telephone adding that 
all important objects are heavily guarded.

<F P=106> [Report by Vadim Ogurtsov: "`Don's Choice' Protests"] </F>
  [Text] The inner soviet and administration of the Don have 
adopted a decision on elections to representative bodies of 
state power in Rostov Oblast and organs of local 
self-government. But the "Russia's Choice" territorial bloc, 
which calls itself "Don's Choice" here, has very strongly 
protested the Statutes on Elections to the Legislative Assembly, 
approved by an oblast inner soviet decision. In the first 
place, State Duma deputy B. Titenko and other members of the 
bloc's regional political council stressed at a press 
conference, the inner soviet "adopted" this document after the 
new Russian Constitition depriving the old structure of its last 
juridical rights and powers had come into effect. According to 
the political council, the situation is not remedied by the 
"invitation to representatives of parties and movements," which 
was essentially a variation on "nationwide discussion." The 
Soviet's decision and confirmation followed as before. 
  The blatant breach of the principle of separation of powers, 
since the "statutes," even at local level, do not allow a 
deputy's duties to be combined with work in the executive organs 
of power, is described as the second flaw.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Shatalov: "Vladimir Preparations"] </F>
  [Text] Vladimir Oblast Administration Chief Yu. Vlasov has 
approved statutes for an Oblast Duma and elections to it. 
  The draft of this document was first discussed in detail at 
an oblast assembly of representatives of various parties, 
movements, and other public organizations, and also power 
structures. There were major objections from assembly 
participants to the administration's proposal to elect 17 
deputies to the future Duma who would work on a permanent basis. 
In that case, the opponents claimed, not all Vladimir Oblast 
rayons would be represented in it, not to mention the fact that 
it would have to operate without standing commissions. But, 
apparently, the representative body henceforth will operate 
without standing commissions, since the final version of the 
statutes on the Oblast Duma provides for 21 deputies. 
  The original draft statutes on elections also underwent 
significant changes. Now someone wishing to register as a 
candidate in an electoral district requires not three but only 
two percent of voters' signatures in his favor. According to 
the statutes, groups of voters, public associations, and 
individuals are entitled to nominate a candidate.

  [Excerpts] A report on an "Ostankino" television and radio

that during B.N. Yeltsin's visit to St. Petersburg the Russian 
Federation president and the city Mayor A. Sobchak discussed the 
future prospects for turning Kronshtadt into a free economic 
zone and in this connection the naval base's relocation. 
[passage omitted] 
  Editorial note: On the basis of information from sources 
within the Russian Navy Main Staff, IZVESTIYA has been informed 
that as yet no specific decision has been made concerning 
Kronshtadt. Relocating this naval base really does require 
enormous resources which nobody has appropriated, and nobody has 
produced a plan to set up a base in another location. Such an 
order has not been given. Kronshtadt will remain a Russian 
naval base for a long time to come.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yuriy Alekseyevich Bondazhevskiy, </F>
internal troops unit commander, by unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given; from the "Kamchatka News" program] 
  [Text] The new recruits for the special motorized units of 
the internal troops were sworn in on 23 January. The soldiers 
will begin independent patrols on the streets of the oblast 
center from the middle of February. Our correspondent is 
discussing the manpower acquisition problems with the unit 
commander, Yuriy Bondazhevskiy. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Yuriy Alekseyevich, I 
know that the personnel situation is quite strained at the 
moment; what is the situation in your unit? How is the 
recruiting progressing? In recent times, there has been no one 
left to serve. 
  [Bondazhevskiy] That is a fact; 1993 has been a difficult 
year in respect of personnel and in fact we have only been at 50 
percent strength. Currently, the situation is significantly 
better and the units are 96 percent manned. The situation with 
contract manpower acquisition is a bit more complicated. 
However, there are a number of objective reasons for this, the 
first of which is housing conditions. 
  Despite the internal troops manpower acquisition principle 
that they are to be from outside the territory and are to serve 
for three or four years, it has become fashionable to serve in 
the area where one lives, which is a gross breach of the statute 
on internal troops. If we take the 1992-93 figures, practically 
90 percent of the unit was comprised of local servicemen. At 
present, 56 percent of the young recruits from the 1993 fall 
call up come from the Petropavlovsk city and Kamchatka Oblast 
Voyenkomats [Military Commissariat]. 
  We see a solution to this situation in the following: carry 
out an exchange of personnel with other similar units located in 
the Far East. That is, the basic task, namely, guarding public 
order suffers because the majority of local servicemen are 
serving in local units. Use of local manpower leaves its mark, 
which is evident if we compare 1992 with 1991. Despite the 
number of personnel remaining the same there was a change in 
their quality, due to local content -- service effectiveness and 
quality of service declined substantially. 
  [Correspondent] The presence of militiamen on duty on the 
streets is not noticeable at present, yet you say that units are 
96 percent up to strength. 
  [Bondazhevskiy] Yes, the fall-intake recruits are undergoing 
their basic training course. It is almost completed and in the 
course of the next two or three days they will be doing their 
examinations. Subsequently, they will be allocated to units 
where they will begin their independent duties. [end recording]

  [Text] Volunteers of the Caucasus People's Confederation

Ossetia if the upcoming Russian-Georgian agreement exacerbates 
the situation there, Ali Aliyev, chairman of the CPC parliament, 
told your MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent. According to 
Aliyev, last year formations of the Abkhaz and "confederate" 
forces were mightily armed thanks to captured Georgian armored 
vehicles and heavy artillery. Last year, Captain 1st Rank 
Aliyev said, we had the military and moral potential enough to 
advance through half of Georgia and to reach Kutaisi. 
  The South Ossetian parliament asked the Russian Federation 
Council not to ratify the agreement until the Georgian-South 
Ossetian conflict is resolved.

<F P=106> [By correspondent A. Yaroshevskiy; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today the leaders of all groups in the lower chamber 
of the Russian Parliament and its chairmen sent a letter to 
Boris Yeltsin containing a warning, to the effect that the 
Russo-Georgian friendship treaty may not be ratified by the 
State Duma. The main reason for apprehension is a possible 
destabilization of the situation in the Caucasus, associated 
with signing the treaty. 
  [Yaroshevskiy] Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State 
Duma's Committee for CIS Affairs and Links With Compatriots, has 
just ended a news conference, at which he acquainted journalists 
with the committee's statement on the Russo-Georgian treaty. 
Essentially the first serious non-acceptance of a presidential 
decision by Duma deputies was occasioned mainly by worries about 
exacerbating the conflicts in the Caucasus and the siting of 
Russian military bases in Georgia. 
  Incidentally, Zatulin acknowledged that some information on 
the subject leaked from the mass media, specifically from 
Russian TV's political observer Nikolay Svanidze, yesterday. 
Evidently, in a week's time, on Thursday, the State Duma will 
debate Russo-Georgian relations, whatever the outcome of the 
talks between Yeltsin and Shevardnadze. 
  [Zatulin] The State Duma cannot, has no right, and I think 
from a moral and ethical point of view, ought not to instruct 
the president of the Russian Federation as to where he goes or 
when.

meeting of the Cabinet's presidium were told that from now on, 
only ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA reporters would be allowed to attend 
these meetings. 
  As we reported earlier, the post of this newspaper's 
director-general is occupied by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's former press secretary and advisor Pavel Gurin. 
  The government's spokesman told our correspondent, who was 
denied access to the presidium's first official meeting, like 
his colleagues from ITAR-TASS, RIA and other news agencies, that 
this instruction had been issued by Chief of the government's 
Staff Vladimir Kvasov. 
  He added that the results of the Cabinet's meetings would be 
highlighted during briefings to which reporters would be invited. 
  Our correspondent also reports that over the past two years 
this was the first time when the press was denied access to a 
Cabinet's meeting which did not deal with "closed" issues.

  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- Head of the Russian 
Government's apparatus Vladimir Kvasov has admitted that he had 
issued a verbal order to bar journalists from the Thursday 
meeting of the Russian Government. An exception was made only 
to a representative of the newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  This action was reported by ITAR-TASS. It noted that 
correspondents of news agencies and the television were not 
allowed to attend a meeting of the Russian Government for the 
first time in the past two and a half years. 
  Dwelling on the motives behind this decision, Kvasov told 
the 
newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "The accreditation of journalists 
was all muddled up lately. Absolutely unknown people come to 
the Presidium. And then various assessments, views and critical 
remarks appeared in the press even before we began to discuss 
this or that problem. After all, a government meeting is not a 
show. It is serious, hard and responsible work". 
  Touching on ways to allow the mass media to objectively 
cover 
the work of the Russian Government, Kvasov noted: "We are ready 
to furnish them with all the necessary materials, but only after 
a final decision is made on the discussed problems." 
  Speaking about the February 3 meeting, Kvasov noted that "it 
continued for almost six hours, while some other meetings were 
even longer. And this time is sufficient for this or that 
minister to say quite a lot. Why must we disclose our kitchen. 
No other government permits this. Just try to come to such a 
meeting in France or Britain. This will, mildly speaking, evoke 
surprise." 
  Asked by the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA whether journalists would 
henceforth be barred from meetings of the government's Presidium 
and whether this was fair, Kvasov stated: 
  "Whenever some restrictions are imposed, we are immediately 
accused of encroaching upon the freedom of speech. There is no 
such ban in the true sense of the word. We must merely put 
everything in proper order. Representatives of the ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA will be allowed to attend all the meetings, because it is 
a government publication. This refers also to ITAR-TASS. The 
other newspapers, the radio and the television will be allowed 
to attend such meetings in accordance with a newly endorsed 
list. But they will have limited access. The presence of 
representatives from these publications will depend on the 
agenda. We shall invite everybody to broader meetings, and only 
the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and ITAR-TASS To other sessons," Kvasov 
stressed. "The other publications will get all the necessary 
materials from the government's press service," he added.

<F P=106> [Address by President Leonid Kravchuk at the Supreme Council </F>
session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed Ivan Stepanovych, esteemed people's 
deputies! The issues that have been submitted for your 
consideration are of an exceptionally important significance. 
Without exaggeration, the future of Ukraine as an independent 
state depends to a large extent on the decision you will adopt 
today. As you know, on 18 November 1993, the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine adopted a resolution on the ratification of the START 
Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol with certain reservations. Among 
other things, it also contained an instruction to the president 
of Ukraine and the government to hold appropriate negotiations 
between interested states and international organizations with 
the aim of due protection of both Ukraine's security and its 
material interests, which would open the possibilities of the 
START I treaty entering into force and would initiate the 
process of genuine nuclear disarmament in the world. 
  You are aware of the world's reaction to the adopted 
resolution. After this decision of the Supreme Council, Ukraine 
stood before the threat of full isolation, and the negative 
image that our state earned because of this, began to intensify 
to a level that opened the possibility of imposing more than 
just economic forms of pressure. 
  In the present economic crisis situation, this has already 
concealed a threat to the very existence of the Ukrainian state. 
It is precisely to avoid this danger that, in accordance with 
my instruction, trilateral negotiations were held with the 
United States and Russia, with the aim of justly resolving the 
problems of nuclear weapons, to drag Ukraine away from the 
interminable conflicts with Russia and the world community, and 
to concentrate our international efforts on the creation of 
favorable external conditions for carrying out deep reforms in 
Ukraine's economy. 
  The statement and appendix signed in Moscow, even though 
they 
are not international agreements, define the political 
obligations of the three presidents within the framework of 
compromise reached between the three states in resolving the 
problems of nuclear weapons that Ukraine inherited from the 
former USSR. The text of the statement and the appendix are 
proof of the realization of Ukraine's strategic policy in 
acquiring nonnuclear status that was defined in the declaration 
on state sovereignty, in Supreme Council statements on Ukraine's 
nonnuclear status, and parliamentary resolutions on additional 
measures to guarantee that Ukraine acquires nonnuclear status. 
None of the resolutions adopted by the Supreme Council has cast 
doubt on this policy. 
  In particular, the accords achieved in Moscow envisage -- 
after the START I Treaty comes into force and Ukraine accedes to 
the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] -- the granting to 
Ukraine of guarantees for its national security, which include 
pledges regarding confirmation, concerning Ukraine, of its 
independence, sovereignty and existing borders, and refraining 
from threats of force or the use of force or measures of 
economic pressure. 
  The next thing envisaged is the pledge by the United States 
of America to grant Ukraine the appropriate funds for the 
dismantlement of nuclear weapons, with the possibility of 
increasing the volume of such assistance in the future. 
  The withdrawal of all nuclear warheads from Ukraine to 
Russia 
for their dismantlement is envisaged with the concurrent 
granting of compensation in the form of deliveries of fuel 
assemblies to Ukraine for its nuclear power engineering 
requirements. 
  Apart from that, and this is of especial political 
significance, it was confirmed that Ukraine, the United States, 
and Russia will cooperate between themselves as equal partners, 
and that relations between them should be developed on 
principles of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity of each state. The United States also 
stated its readiness to render assistance to Ukraine in creating 
a market economy in Ukraine. 
  Some people say that the text of the statement does not 
fully 
correspond to the reservations formulated by the Supreme Council 
because it supposedly departs from specific figures of 
limitations regarding elimination of warheads and carriers 
[nosiyi] fixed in Point 6 of the 17 November resolution. 
  But this same article says that this same point makes it 
possible to destroy nuclear weapons in excess of the established 
limitations. That is, the executive power received the authority 
to agree on the dismantlement of warheads, the process (?of 
destruction) of which should take place in compliance with 
procedures, which have not been established by the START I 
Treaty. 
  That is, the point is that we strove to carry out those 
maximum possibilities laid down in the Supreme Council 
resolution, but naturally certain compromises are inevitable in 
these cases. Thus, the tripartite statement and the appendix to 
it, and also their implementation, in our opinion, and this is 
true, meet the demands set forth in the resolution of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 November 1993. 
  I emphasize, the principle reservations, principle 
reservations by the Supreme Council have been carried out by the 
executive power. This is a reply to our just doubts and the 
reservations with regard to the resolution by our Supreme 
Council. In connection with this, I introduced a proposal 
through a legislative initiative in accordance with Article 103 
of the Ukrainian Constitution, on the removal of the 
reservations contained in the Supreme Council resolutions dated 
18 November 1993 regarding Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, and 
Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons. 
  It seems that the issue of the need for Ukraine to accede to 
the NPT that was at the center of attention not only here in 
Ukraine, but also in the whole international community, should 
be obvious and understood by everyone who lives in the real 
world. This corresponds to Ukraine's long-term national 
interests, including the interests of guaranteeing our national 
security. It is true that some either consciously or 
subconsciously are twisting the facts, attempting to prove that 
Ukraine could become a nuclear state; that because of this its 
security would supposedly increase and its importance in 
international relations would grow, and that we could defend our 
independence, territorial integrity, and the future flourishing 
of the Ukrainian people with nuclear weapons. I repeat, data 
about the real state of affairs demonstrate that it is simply 
impossible to defend this thesis if one knows and listens and 
take these realities into account. 
  The situation for our military men, leading scientists and 
nuclear workers, and other experts who are involved with this 
affair is absolutely clear. I remind you of some irrefutable 
facts. First, the nuclear button, i.e. the entire command 
infrastructure necessary for the targeting and launching of 
missiles is located, as before, in Moscow. Nobody, and this 
must be taken into account, will allow us to take over this 
control without unforeseen consequences as some people naively 
suggest. Such actions could only provoke the emergence of an 
acute military danger for Ukraine. I repeat, it will not protect 
Ukraine's security, but will provoke the emergence of a danger. 
  Since nuclear weapons located in Ukraine are not controlled 
by us, they cannot play the role of a factor restraining a 
potential aggressor. They cannot. As it is known, strategic 
missiles that are on combat duty in Ukraine today are a threat 
only to the United States. And it seems that everyone 
understands it is not preparing to attack us. But there is also 
a danger for us through the dangerous condition of the missiles 
because of the lack of supplies of vital components, first of 
all from Russia. Beginning from this year, the guarantee 
period, not only of combat capability, but simply of safe 
storage of a considerable number of warheads, is being 
terminated. In 1995 this process will take on a catastrophic 
nature. Specific calculations and data are proof of this. But 
the moment that the nuclear warhead guarantee period is 
exhausted, it becomes a danger for others and a danger for us, 
i.e. for those on whose territory they are based. Such nuclear 
warheads must be taken away to be dismantled and reprocessed 
since, as you know, we do not have the appropriate factories. 
But the weapons' manufacturers are in Russia. If we do not do 
this, then there could be a danger of a new tragedy, this is a 
reality. I think that it is a great responsibility for us all. 
Through our Defense Ministry, I received an appropriate 
decision from the chief designers of the nuclear warheads. I 
would like you to know about this and probably there is now no 
need to conceal it from the Ukrainian people. 
  Now I will read this in the original. In connection with 
the fact that the service life of certain warheads expired, we 
moved them out [of Ukraine] at the end of December to be 
dismantled. Designers provide us with the following data: 
[switches to Russian] I inform you about the decision by the 
chief designers, developers of nuclear warheads, coordinated 
with the interdepartmental commission of the Ministry of Nuclear 
Power Engineering and the Ministry of Defense of Russia, on the 
results of the defect-finding inspection [defektatsiya] of the 
three combat units whose term of technical servicing expired and 
which were delivered from Ukraine. 
  During the visual inspection of the combat units, the 
commission members found corrosive products on the surfaces of 
the uranium parts that are the source of heightened toxic and 
radiological danger. Proceeding from the results of the work 
done by the commission, the chief designers arrived at a 
conclusion that the violation of the rules of technical 
servicing of nuclear warheads leads to the emergence of 
irreversible processes of aging in them, to the changes in 
physical and chemical properties of dangerously explosive and 
radioactive materials. The above phenomena increase the danger 
during the nuclear warheads' dismantling. Further use and 
storage of these warheads aggravates the processes taking place 
in them, which may lead to the formation of dangerously 
explosive mixtures within their hermetic capacities. [back to 
Ukrainian] 
  Here is such a piece of information. I would like to tell 
you that my consultations with relevant scientific institutions 
in Ukraine and the scientists who are involved in this, confirm 
this assessment and this danger. 
  So, the nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine from the former 
USSR not only cannot be used to support Ukraine's security, but 
are a threat to it. We do not have the appropriate scientific 
nor the manufacturing infrastructure -- for which tens of 
billions of dollars are needed -- to independently manufacture 
new nuclear weapons, nor do we have a place where such weapons 
could be tested. I hope that the majority of people and people's 
deputies of Ukraine had the possibility to see and hear the 
opinions of leading Ukrainian scientists on this issue, which 
was on Ukrainian television. If we cannot be a true nuclear 
state and gain something positive from this, then why not accede 
to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, along with the other 180 
world states? 
  Why should we insist on preserving the situation as it is, 
whereas at the meetings between the president or other leaders 
of Ukraine and world leaders, or at the diplomatic talks, or at 
any other meetings, those with ordinary people and the mass 
media, they always begin the talk with one and the same thing: 
People just do not understand why we are insisting on exactly 
such a stand. 
  Though some people believe that the world's concern about 
Ukraine's attitude toward nuclear weapons is for the benefit of 
Ukraine, that this adds to our state's authority. Well, at this 
point they somehow forget that before the signing of the 
trilateral statement, Ukraine had increasingly often been placed 
in one group of states that have an unequivocally negative 
reputation throughout the world. I felt this personally, and 
the foreign minister who was taking part, as they say, from the 
Rome to the Brussels meetings, and who is present here, will 
have a chance to share his impressions with you. 
  The fact that the problem of nuclear arms stationed in 
Ukraine remained in suspense had, until recently, been one of 
the main obstacles in the way toward a full-blooded development 
of mutually advantageous cooperation with foreign countries. 
After the Supreme Council had adopted the resolution on the 
START ratification, they were emphasizing it straightforwardly 
and unequivocally at all levels, that until Ukraine ratified the 
Lisbon Protocol in full volume and joined the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, the rendering of effective aid toward 
building a market economy would be just impossible. 
  Moreover, it was difficult to hope for a normal attitude 
toward us on the part of many countries of the world. They say 
that this is the dictate. One can agree with this. We, they 
say, must show our protest. But to do this we should act in 
compliance with the obligations that we assumed and not ruin the 
situation that took shape. 
  Ukraine now is being accused of something very serious: If 
we do not act in accordance with the position we announced 
earlier, we are stopping further world disarmament. START II 
comes under threat, and it is this for which Ukraine is being 
accused. Although the state of our economy and the possibility 
of reforming it depends in the first instance on us -- and this 
is true -- without support from international financial 
institutions, leading Western states, and not only with money 
but also with experience, private investments, and the granting 
of access to their markets, we will not manage. Certainly we 
would not be able to do without the Russian market. 
  Can we really expect the development of normal, I stress, 
normal relations with Russia without deciding this painful 
problem? If someone thinks we can then he is deeply mistaken. 
  In this connection, I would like to say this: It is exactly 
now that we have almost managed to completely reach an 
understanding of our problems, the main one of which being the 
readiness to assist us in the complicated matter of reforming 
the economy on the part of leading Western countries and 
international institutions. Our nearest neighbors' attitude to 
us is also different now. 
  Just now, we have received a statement on behalf of the 
chairman of the European Union, saying that the trilateral 
accords, reached in Moscow, open the way for the development of 
full-scale, fruitful relations and cooperation between Ukraine 
and the European Union. During his stay in Kiev, U.S. President 
Bill Clinton assured us that the United States had made use of 
their ability to influence leading international financial 
organizations in order to provide the assistance we need. 
  The delegation that held negotiations in Washington last 
week 
reports that we have already seen a fundamental change in the 
attitude toward Ukraine of both the United States and the 
international community, the International Monetary Fund, and 
the World Bank. They are ready to provide our state with 
considerable financial and technological assistance and credit. 
A mechanism has been initiated to realize this assistance in 
all-sided economic cooperation. The details of this are known 
to you, I hope, from the joint statement that has been made 
public. These, strictly speaking, are some of the first 
reactions and proposals. I am sure there will be others that 
will be no less serious. 
  Everything will now depend on us alone and our readiness to 
make use of this moment and these possibilities, and to unite in 
performing our most important task today, which task, in my 
view, is to curb the crisis trends in our economy and carry out 
serious reforms in the direction of creating a democratic state 
and a socially-oriented market economy. 
  I would once again like to emphasize this: Today, the future 
of Ukraine as an independent, influential and -- in the future 
-- a prosperous European state, does not depend on nuclear 
weapons. The former USSR had more than enough of them, but 
however, did not come to its rescue. The future of Ukraine 
depends on the economic well-being and social stability of our 
society. If we do overcome the current economic crisis, we will 
be able to safeguard our independence and inviolability of our 
borders. Nor will we -- once again with the help from 
international organizations -- allow anyone to interfere in our 
internal affairs. 
  I think the time has come -- and a decisive time it is too 
-- 
for every one of us present in this hall, to once and for all 
understand that in order to make a realistic policy, really 
aimed to protect our vital national interests and those of all 
ordinary people, one should first of all conscientiously look to 
reality, weigh up the possibilities, and finally be ready to 
take serious and responsible decisions. I am (?more than) 
convinced that it is exactly this decision that Ukraine needs to 
make today. 
  Thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov and Besik Urigashvili: "Russia </F>
and Georgia Agree on Military Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The main event of Boris Yeltsin's visit 
to Georgia is the signing of a treaty of friendship, 
good-neighborliness, and cooperation, and also a number of 
documents on economic ties. 
  Most interesting of all are the military aspects of the 
treaty, which state that the two sides commit themselves to 
taking measures designed to guarantee each other's security and 
defense organizational development. The treaty also envisages 
joint protection of Georgia's foreign borders, which are also 
the borders of the CIS. The result of the preliminary 
consultations between Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and 
Shevardnadze was an agreement on establishing three Russian 
military bases on Georgian territory. The number of troops at 
these bases will not exceed 20,000 men. Nothing has yet been 
announced about the purpose or size of the bases or the terms of 
the lease, but at this preliminary stage, the members of the 
Russian delegation indicated, we are talking about Air Force and 
Naval bases. The Russian troops stationed in Georgia will 
occupy their former positions and guard railroad lines. 
  Russia will provide Georgia with assistance in setting up a 
national army and equip it with weapons, hardware, and 
technology without the right to transfer these products to other 
countries. It is generally supposed that this point of the 
treaty will displease both Abkhazia and a number of North 
Caucasian peoples who are supporting the Abkhazian separatists. 
This military "tethering" of Georgia to Russia, the opposition 
believes, will increase Shevardnadze's dependence on Moscow's 
policy even more. 
  The majority faction in the State Duma has expressed its own 
position on this issue by noting the obviously anti-Abkhazian 
bent of the military cooperation. There can be no doubt that 
the treaty will run into difficulty at the ratification stage in 
the parliaments of both countries. However, Boris Yeltsin 
intends to resolutely follow up the promises he has made and he 
stressed that the present treaty is in no sense a military pact 
against anyone. 
  Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze also discussed the 
prospects for the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. They 
expressed restrained approval of the UN Security Council's plans 
to increase the number of international observers in Abkhazia to 
88, but they did not hide their disappointment that the UN is 
delaying its decision to send "blue helmets" to the conflict 
zone. 
  In an interview with IZVESTIYA, Georgian Foreign Minister A. 
Chikvaidze noted that the situation is deadlocked. The United 
Nations does not want to give its mandate to the Russian Army 
until it can see real progress on the political settlement 
front. But the settlement process has now come up against the 
problem of refugees who are afraid to return to their homes 
unless peacekeeping forces appear on the banks of the Inguri. 
  In September last year Pavel Grachev proposed to Eduard 
Shevardnadze that Russian troops should be sent to Abkhazia, but 
the Georgian president declined this proposal. Tbilisi now 
recognizes that this was the wrong course of action. 
  In Tbilisi, despite the security measures taken in 
connection 
with Yeltsin's visit, terrorist acts are still taking place. 
The night before the arrival of the Russian president, Colonel 
Nikolay Kekelidze, an aide to one of Georgia's deputy defense 
ministers, was blown up after stepping on a mine in the porch of 
his home.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Russian Economics Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin today informed the Council of the Federation, 
the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, on the government's 
plans concerning the budget, taxes, crediting, and the 
agricultural policy. 
  This item on the council's agenda has triggered rather keen 
debates. The council wanted the prime minister to personally 
deliver a report on the government's policy and to answer their 
questions. 
  Speaker of the Council of the Federation Vladimir Shumeyko 
told the MPs that Premier Chernomyrdin was expected to chair a 
meeting of the government today and then fly to Minsk. This 
triggered a heated discussion and the speaker was asked to begin 
"immediate talks" with the head of the Russian Government. It 
was moved to delete the item from the agenda if the premier 
refused to deliver the report. The government was blamed of 
disrespect for the upper chamber of the parliament. 
  Chairman of the Karelian Supreme Soviet Viktor Stepanov 
urged 
his colleagues "not to stir up passions around the government" 
and to hear the economics minister's information, as proposed by 
the government, and then, possessing concrete data, to hear a 
report by the prime minister himself. After several futile 
votes, the deputies decided by a roll-call vote to meet 
Chernomyrdin at any time suiting him today. 
  The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of Shokhin, 
who 
took the floor and informed the deputies on the government's 
plans. He stressed that the main trend of the budget policy 
would be to toughen financial discipline. The high rates of 
inflation during the past month "is not a result of the 
government's January policy, but of earlier decisions, and also 
of the political situation in mid-January, provoked by growing 
inflation". 
  The economics minister recalled that it was necessary to 
complete the privatisation process before July 1st, and to think 
over the next stage of privatisation, over the "effective use of 
joint-stock property". 
  In the sphere of social policy, the government plans to 
check 
the dropping living standards and to stabilise them. It is 
necessary to render effective support to concrete sections of 
the population. Shokhin admitted that the scope of latent 
unemployment was sufficiently large, noting that it was 
impermissible to stop enterprises in several sectors of the 
economy. 
  Touching on the problem of the rouble zone, the minister 
stressed that the merger of the currencies of cis countries 
should not be detrimental to Russia. He noted that firm 
negotiations were being conducted with Belarus, "marked by 
sufficiently comprehensive and tough quantitative demands". 
  The upper chamber of the Russian parliament took note of the 
minister's information.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev under "Position" </F>
rubric: "Foreign Policy and the Russian Parliament"] 
  [Text] P.A. Stolypin is responsible for an idea which 
reflects the essence of the problem of Russia's foreign policy 
today surprisingly accurately: "If the state has healthy and 
strong roots, then believe me, the words of the Russian 
Government will sound completely different to Europe and the 
whole world." 
  Our diplomacy needs a strong home front now as never before. 
A major step has been taken toward this -- the adoption of the 
Constitution. The election of the parliament may also create 
preconditions for strengthening Russian statehood, and 
consequently for putting foreign policy opportunities and the 
work of the past two years into practice, and for completing the 
arsenal of the Russian state's diplomacy. 

<H5>    Continuation of Partnership or "Imperial" Impasse? </H5>
  The main result of the implementation of the president's 
foreign policy is the fact that at a turning point in its 
history, in the face of the collapse of the communist system and 
the disintegration of the USSR, Russia has not found itself in 
the position of a social outcast on the international arena, as 
was the case in 1917. 
  The fact that we managed to avoid the worst -- a repetition 
of the Yugoslav tragedy on the territory of a nuclear superpower 
-- happened because we did not take the "imperial" path, we did 
not start trying to restore a union state by force or redraw the 
borders. We also rejected appeals of the opposite sort -- to 
distance ourselves from the problems of the former Union 
altogether and withdraw into isolation. A difficult path, but 
ultimately the only sensible one, was chosen -- to consistently 
develop the post-Soviet area by developing the CIS. Today, 
despite all the difficulties of the formation of the 
Commonwealth, it is proving possible to move gradually toward 
closer cooperation in politics and resolve old and new problems 
in a civilized way within its framework. 
  Are there ways of more effectively protecting our interests 
in nearby foreign parts? In any case, our diplomacy is 
constantly seeking them out. But only within the framework of a 
principled choice in favor of advancing national interests via 
partnership rather than confrontation, and via direct observance 
of international law. To betray this choice for the sake of 
attempts to realize the myth of "reviving the empire" by force, 
not to mention delirious ideas about a "dash toward the warm 
seas," would mean once again setting yourself in confrontation 
with the whole world, and returning to the "besieged fortress" 
policy. This would mean transforming foreign policy from an 
important source of help in implementing reforms into a 
superfluous load aggravating the country's already serious 
internal problems, and indeed capable of sinking the country 
altogether. 
  Clearly, such adventurism would immediately and acutely 
complicate the situation of Russians in the former Union 
republics, and a new wave of refugees would inundate Russia. 
Maybe that is what supporters of the "imperial" policy need in 
order to obtain a pretext for "restoring order" in Russia itself? 
  Meanwhile, the interests of our compatriots in the former 
republics can only be ensured if internationally recognized 
standards in the sphere of human rights and the rights of ethnic 
minorities are observed throughout the area of the former USSR. 
With this aim in mind we have already concluded dozens of 
bilateral and multilateral agreements with our CIS partners. It 
was on our initiative that the Declaration on International 
Commitments in the Sphere of Human Rights and Basic Freedoms was 
adopted in the CIS, and the Commission for Human Rights set up. 
We take a tough line on any violations of the lawful interests 
of our fellow countrymen, and we invite international 
organizations and partners in other foreign countries to 
participate in the work of defending them. 
  However, it must be admitted that at the political level 
our understanding of the acuteness of the problems of the 
Russian-speaking population is being transformed too slowly and 
with too much difficulty into the creation of effective 
mechanisms for solving them. 
  Which direction we will move in -- toward fascism or, 
conversely, toward stability and democracy in our society -- 
will depend largely on how responsible and farsighted our 
parliamentarians are with regard to the problem of the 
Russian-speaking population. We have to start with ourselves. 
And obviously not with irresponsible statements insulting the 
honor of entire nations and provoking discrimination against the 
Russian-speaking minority, but with setting an example of a 
consistent battle against chauvinism and ethnic hatred. For 
example, the Federal Assembly could express itself in one form 
or another in support of the Declaration on Aggressive 
Nationalism, Racism, Chauvinism, Xenophobia, and 
Anti-Semitism, adopted on Russia's initiative by the 
foreign ministers of CSCE member states in December of last 
year. This would be a good signal both internally and 
externally. 
  For the first time in Russia's history it has neither 
immediate nor even potential military adversaries. This creates 
the preconditions for a significant reduction in the burden of 
defense expenditure, which is particularly important at the 
initial, most complex phase of economic reforms. 
  However, threats of a new type have appeared which demand 
the 
strengthening of democratic statehood, the creation of economic, 
effective, and mobile armed forces. I refer to local conflicts, 
particularly in the CIS, the danger of the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons, and international terrorism. 
  We are already resolving many tasks concerning the 
prevention 
and settlement of armed conflicts near our borders with the help 
of the United Nations and the CSCE. We are seeking the 
expansion of aid to the Russian peacekeeping effort on the part 
of the world community on the basis of the reality of Russia's 
special interests and responsibility. Neither we nor our 
partners in the CIS can accept the "residual principle" which 
the United Nations still espouses in allocating the 
organization's resources for peacekeeping aims in the 
Commonwealth. 
  But these efforts of ours can be effective only if they 
given 
society's firm support. Extremist appeals to either abandon 
everything and pull out of the conflict zones in the CIS, or 
else "establish order" by force do damage to both Russia's 
actual peacekeeping mission and also to the world community's 
perception of our aims in the nearby foreign countries. 
  Russia is reaching the level of mature partnership with the 
leading democratic states of the world. This is directly 
enshrined in very important documents concluded with the FRG, 
France, Britain, the United States, Sweden, Denmark, and a 
number of other states. 
  Thanks to partnership relations with the West, we have 
entered key world economic organizations. Although the rate of 
cooperation falls short of what we would desire, we have 
nevertheless recently received soft loans to the tune of $2.5 
billion from the IMF alone, and preferential credits to the tune 
of $0.6 billion from the World Bank. It is time to proceed 
further without artificial delays. 
  Russian foreign policy has saved the country from falling 
into the abyss of international financial bankruptcy, on the 
brink of which the former Soviet Union stood. We have received 
a 10-year deferment from the Paris Club on payments due for 
1992-1993 on the former USSR's foreign debt totaling $15 
billion. The London Club has granted us a five-year deferment 
on the sum of $3 billion. 
  It is specifically the new nature of relations with the West 
that permits us to defend Russia's lawful interests in the 
sphere of security, the economy, trade, and so on, increasingly 
actively. Amid political tension, this would be even more 
difficult. 
  We are striving for Russia's political interests to be taken 
into account as well. A typical example is the recent adoption 
by NATO countries of the "Partnership for Peace" concept instead 
of the immediate extension of NATO membership to the borders of 
the CIS. Cooperation between Russia and the United States 
helped to achieve the trilateral agreement on the full 
elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. 
  The mechanism of new ties with the West is still far from 
being perfect. So far no "consultation reflex" has yet been 
developed, which would ensure timely consideration of mutual 
interests in an uninterrupted fashion. In a number of 
situations -- Tajikistan, Georgia, and Yugoslavia -- we have had 
to exert a lot of effort to ensure Russia's position and the 
understanding and assistance of the United Nations and the CSCE. 
We are proposing to the "Big Seven" and other leading powers 
that a strategy of mature partnership of a long-term nature be 
coordinated. 
  It is equally ridiculous to set the rapprochement with the 
West against the development of Russia's relations with Eastern 
states, and with the development of its relations with CIS 
countries. On the contrary, a serious positive potential in 
mutual relations with the great Asian powers -- China, India, 
and Japan -- is being created. Diplomacy has "discovered" new 
partners for Russian business, including in the sphere of 
military-technical cooperation -- South Korea, ASEAN, and the 
states of the Persian Gulf. 
  Obviously Russia's attractiveness both for the West and for 
the East depends in many respects on the stability and 
predictability of our internal situation. No one will invest in 
a country where there is great uncertainty. The sooner we adopt 
laws which meet the needs of the market economy, the faster will 
be the rate and volume of the trade and economic cooperation 
with foreign countries that is so vital to us today. 

<H5>    Diplomacy Needs Support From the Legislators </H5>
  In foreign policy matters, the stance that the Federal 
Assembly occupies will to a great extent determine the face that 
Russia shows to the world -- the face of the unpredictable "sick 
man" of Europe and Asia, or that of a great Eurasian power and a 
responsible and reliable partner. 
  The Foreign Ministry sees the Federal Assembly as a state 
institution capable of ensuring, within the limits of its 
competence, a reliable legal base for our foreign policy, and 
assisting the government in implementing laws affecting Russia's 
interests and in complying with international treaties. We are 
also hoping for constructive dialogue on the best paths our 
activities should take. 
  The Supreme Soviet also had the chance to become a serious 
state institution, but, unfortunately, it was not taken up. The 
Foreign Ministry unfailingly strove for cooperation. During the 
initial phase of the Supreme Soviet's work, this was to some 
paid off. However, as its confrontation with the executive grew, 
the discussion of foreign policy questions increasingly turned 
into a settling of ideological scores. Unfortunately, even 
today, side by side with the pseudopatriotic extremism, it not 
been possible to eliminate the lingering bombast, personal 
arrogance, and unprincipled compromises which are being passed 
off as centrism. Both as a State Duma deputy and as a minister 
I will not make concessions to those who want to push Russian 
diplomacy onto the track of imperial "anti-Western" or 
aggressively nationalist policy which would inevitably lead the 
country to a catastrophe. At the same time, I am prepared to 
cooperate with any critics or political trends in the interests 
of patriotic, open, and professional foreign policy. 
  What could constitute a responsible foreign policy agenda 
for 
the new parliament? 
  First of all, the ratification of around 60 treaties that 
the 
Supreme Soviet did not examine. These include major ones such 
as the START II Treaty, and agreements on legal aid and military 
and economic cooperation with CIS countries. 
  Second, the adoption of laws providing for the efficient 
work 
of Russia's foreign policy mechanism. This means a law on the 
Russian Federation's international treaties, a law on the 
diplomatic service, and the Consular Regulations. We are also 
counting on constructive consultations during the preparation of 
the president's decisions on appointing Russian ambassadors and 
representatives at international organizations (in accordance 
with Article 83 of the Russian Federation Constitution). 
  Third, the adoption of laws providing backup for Russia's 
foreign economic ties, such as a law on the continental shelf 
and the economic zone, and a law on the export of weapons and 
military hardware. 
  Fourth, the elaboration of new laws or the amendment of 
existing ones in the humanitarian sphere. The section on dual 
citizenship in the Law on Citizenship must be brought into line 
with the new Constitution. 
  The creation of a statewide program of support for the 
Russian-speaking population in CIS countries is particularly 
urgent. Our compatriots' rights will only be reliably ensured 
when their economic future is guaranteed and the conditions for 
maintaining their native language and culture are created. 
  The scale of this problem means that the efforts of the 
Foreign Ministry or the immigration service alone are 
insufficient. A special department is needed which would 
shoulder the entire set of questions concerning the protection 
of the rights and interests of our compatriots in nearby and 
more distant foreign countries. 
  Fifth, the creation of legislation ensuring Russia's 
participation in peacekeeping activity, including at UN, CSCE, 
and CIS level. It is time to define the legal basis for the 
presence of Russia's troops abroad, on a treaty basis, of 
course, and in line with the principle of [military] bases. 
  Sixth, the parliament could, in accordance with the 
Constitution, support the desire of the Russian regions to make 
use of the advantages of cooperation with other states. 
Institutions for regional cooperation in the Black Sea, Baltic, 
and Barents-Euro-Arctic regions have been created with Russia's 
active participation. It is high time for there to be analogous 
structures in the Far East for ties with the PRC and Japan. 
  At the same time, legal frameworks for regional foreign 
activity are needed, as well as a clear-cut division of 
prerogatives and functions with federal organs in the interests 
of the state's unity. After all, the more powerful Russia is as 
an international partner, the more profitable it will be for its 
regions to conduct business abroad too. 
  Seventh, parliamentary ties. Regular day-to-day, rather than 
ostentatious, work with the parliamentarians, particularly with 
our neighbors, can supplement the foreign policy work of the 
president and the government, first and foremost in protecting 
the rights of millions of our compatriots in former Soviet 
republics. The status of foreigners in Russia should also be 
brought into line with international standards, by adopting a 
relevant law for this purpose. 
  Today we are investing the prestige of the president's 
foreign policy in the present and future of Russia as a great 
power. The entire gamut of the new opportunities for 
cooperation which have been accumulated at political level must 
be placed at the service of resolving our internal problems, 
primarily economic ones. This is a statewide task. National 
interests, rather than narrow party interests, should serve as 
the guideline here. In resolving this task, parliamentarians 
will have a reliable ally in diplomacy.

<F P=106> [Report by Leonid Levitskiy: "Estonia: Arms Ships Have </F>
Arrived, But Arms Trial Only Beginning"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- The motor ship delivering weapons from 
Israel spent five hours in the port of Tallinn. The consignment 
was valued at $4 million. ETA has reported that Estonia's 
defense forces are now fully equipped with modern weapons. 
Admittedly, an Army spokesman refused to say just what had 
arrived and in what quantities. 
  A year ago the Estonian Government signed a secret contract 
-- secret even to parliament -- with the firm of Taas [name as 
transliterated] Israel Industries Ltd for the delivery of 
weapons. Information reaching the press caused a stir among 
opposition factions -- deputies demanded that the deal be 
discussed, and the government was forced to offer an explanation. 
  The legislators are complaining that the weapons that have 
been bought are not the best, and that the government overpaid 
almost by 100 percent in signing such a major deal arbitrarily. 
Prime Minister Mart Laar has been trying to show that the 
reverse is the case. His main argument is that Western 
countries have been refusing to deliver weapons to Estonia owing 
to the unstable situation there, but Israel agreed. And the 
Taas firm has supplied the weapons on credit -- until the year 
2000. By late 1995 Israel will have delivered weapons worth $50 
million. But, when interest payments are taken into account, 
the total cost will be $60.4 million. Under the contract 
Estonia will receive "Galil" assault rifles, "Negev" machine 
guns, "Mini-Uzi" pistol-type machine guns, marksmen's rifles, 
grenade launchers, 81-mm mortars, 106-mm guns, antiaircraft 
guns, missiles, guided projectiles, and ammunition. 
  The Israeli weapons will be enough for the republic to have 
12,000 men under arms. "When everything covered by the contract 
has arrived, Estonia will be able to resist an aggressor for as 
long as it takes until the international system of assistance 
starts working," Reyn Khelme [name as transliterated], chairman 
of the parliamentary Defense Commission, believes. 
  The problem of cartridges is also being resolved. The 
assault rifles and machine guns meet NATO standards, so 
ammunition can also be bought in Europe. The republic is 
organizing its own cartridge production. 
  The arrival of the Israeli ship coincided with the opening 
of 
the hearing in Tallinn City Court of the suit brought against 
the prime minister by State Assembly member Juri Toomepuu 
[surname as transliterated]. A former U.S. Army colonel, a 
veteran of the Vietnam and Korean Wars, commander of a "Green 
Beret" unit, and now Estonian citizen, Toomepuu believes that 
the head of government's deal with Taas has greatly damaged the 
republic and himself personally as a taxpayer. The 
parliamentarian puts his own material damages at 1,075 krooni 
(around 140,000 rubles) and his personal damages at 10 million 
krooni. We do not know whether the war veteran and weapons 
expert will become an Estonian millionaire. The first court 
hearing ended noncommittally -- the judge asked for additional 
material. Judging by everything, the dogged colonel will yet do 
some damage to the nerves of the government, which undertook to 
arm the republic without consulting this highly experienced 
serviceman....

  [Text] We have just received a report by Nerijus 
Maliukevicius, the president's spokesman for the press, 
concerning the weekly SOBESEDNIK [published in Russia]: 
  Pictures of former members of the CPSU Central Committee 
Political Bureau and candidate members of the Central Committee 
who are presently heads of CIS countries are published on the 
front cover of the Russian weekly SOBESEDNIK's fourth issue of 
this year. Among them, under the title "The CIS Politburo and 
The Central Committee" is a photograph of Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  I have been tasked to state the following concerning the 
above publication: Algirdas Brazauskas has never been member of 
the CPSU Politburo or a candidate member to the CPSU Politburo. 
  At the time when the CPSU Politburo was functioning the 
Lithuanian Communist Party headed by Algirdas Brazauskas left 
the CPSU at the end of 1989. Therefore, after this date, any 
search for cooperation with the above organization cannot be 
fruitful and is even illogical. 
  On 11 March, 1990 Lithuania restored its independence and in 
1991 the people of Lithuania expressed their will through a 
referendum that Lithuania will never join any new political, 
military, or economic or any other kind of union or commonwealth 
which had been set up on the basis of the former Soviet Union. 
This concept has been reinforced by the Supreme Council 
Constitutional Act of 8 June, 1992. Therefore, to regard 
Lithuania and its leader within the context of the CIS is an 
evident case of ignoring historic facts and present day reality. 
  The foreign policy pursued by the president of the republic 
does not give the slightest grounds to claim that there are 
intentions to change the articles of the Constitution of the 
Republic of Lithuania. Therefore, there are no grounds to 
associate the leader of Lithuania, who was directly elected, 
either with the former Central Committee Politbureau or with the 
present CIS. 
  It is difficult to see what the objectives of the 
publication 
in SOBESEDNIK are. However, it is evident that it belittles the 
sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania and attempts to play up 
to those who would like to again draw Lithuania into the sphere 
of their interests.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The results of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's one-day visit to Georgia are one of 
the leading topics in today's Moscow-based press. 
  IZVESTIYA quotes the Russian President as saying at a press 
conference on the resutls of his visit to Tbilisi that "the 
goals of Russian policy are clear and specific: We should have 
not only friendly relations with Georgia but also maintain 
relations of allies." 
  The newspaper points out that "the principal event during 
the 
visit was the signing of a treaty of friendship, 
goodneighbourliness and cooperation as well as a number of 
documents on economic relations." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Georgia: 
  In an article headlined "The Tbilisi Treaty: What It Gives 
to 
Russia and the Peoples of the Caucasus", the newspaper writes 
that due to fellows like an unnamed soldier from among the 
Russian peacekeeping force in South Ossetia, whose picture was 
taken by the newspaper's correspondent (the photograph is on the 
newspaper's front page), "Ossetian and Georgian farmers for the 
first time in years of sanguinary confrontation have got an 
opportunity to go about their primary business in the land of 
their forefathers". 
  Without the Russian soldier-peacemaker, it is impossible to 
undo the knot of Caucasian contradictions, the newspaper added. 
  TRUD and RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA point to a great importance of 
the 
Russian-Georgian treaty for the two countries. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA recalls that the Russian-Georgian 
agreements signed are subject to ratification by the 
parliaments. "There will probably be a lot of opponents of the 
accords" in the top legislatures of both Russia and Georgia," 
the newspaper writes, pointing out that although Moscow 
recognises Georgia's territorial integrity, it nevertheless 
"urges Tbilisi to determine the political status of Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia". 
  PRAVDA takes a rather sceptical view of the results of Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. It points out that although Georgia 
did sign a treaty with Moscow, it is being reported from Sukhumi 
that "Georgian armed detachments already penetrate Abkhazia's 
Gali district". 
  Newspapers feature photographs of the crew of the U.S. space 
shuttle Discovery, with Russian cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev among 
them. The shuttle blasted off into space on Thursday. 
  IZVESTIYA on an instruction issued by the chief of staff of 
the Russian Government that from now on only a representative of 
ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA will be allowed to be present at cabinet 
meetings: 
  "The closed doors, behind which the government policy will 
be 
apparently fashioned from now on, is the most hopeless way to 
avoid public scrutiny of the work of the cabinet of ministers". 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA carries a two-page article by academicians 
Leonid Abalkin, Nikolay Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin, who 
offer a new, milder "economic reform concept". 
  Touching upon Russia's economic and social problems, they 
write in particular that "the country has found itself before a 
dangerous threshold. By crossing it, Russia runs the risk of 
losing forever a chance for revival as a great power". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the academicians' economic 
programme. 
  The newspaper maintains that the programme virtually 
resembles the one suggested by Russian Liberal Democratic Party 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during his election campaign. 
  "The difference is that while Zhirinovskiy can simply speak 
about the problems and promise that they would be resolved 
instantaneously, the government would have to tackle them". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Anatoliy 
Dolgolaptev, member of the Federation Council, who comes out in 
favour of changing Russia's economic and geopolitical status in 
the world, pointing out that this is much more important than 
the vociferous political tussle at the top which diverts the 
attention of society.

  [Text] Moscow February 5 TASS -- IZVESTIYA and TRUD 
frontpage today materials dealing with the economic situation, 
investments and, in connection with them, the social security of 
the population. IZVESTIYA writes that the Ministry of Labour 
summed up some results of the year 1993, describing as 
accomplishments "the stabilisation of the living standards of 
Russian citizens, as well as the non- coming of massive 
unemployment." 
  "Incomes have grown, but the number of the poor has 
increased," the newspaper writes, pointing to the fact that last 
year the incomes of the population went up by nine per cent. 
"Most probably, this is true only of the part of the population 
whose income exceed those of the poorest people by 27 times. A 
major part of the Russian population (77 per cent) had an income 
lower than the double subsistence wage, which stood at 50,000 
roubles in December. One third of them got even less than the 
subsistence level ... The situation on the labour market 
resembles a lull before a storm. Officially, unemployment 
continues to be insignificant and does not exceed one per cent 
of the workforce. However, the so-called hidden unemployment is 
growing. According to various estimates, between four and seven 
million people have a shorter working day or are having unpaid 
vacations." 
  "The government is granting easy-term credits to the 
agrarian 
sector. The inflation rate will grow in the forthcoming 
months," TRUD writes, calling attention to the latest government 
resolutions. "During the current year, 14.1 trillion roubles of 
direct subsidies will be paid out of the budget. The creation 
of a federal food reserve will require another 14.5 trillion 
roubles. Add some other privileges to it, and the total will 
reach 34.7 trillion. The experience of the past several years 
shows that, in the long run, about half of easy-term credits are 
turning into cash money and finding their way to the currency 
market. There is no doubt about the effect: First of all, the 
prices of durables will grow, because people buy them in the 
expectation of further inflation." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI began today the publication of a series of 
articles about the logic and the character of the formation of 
the executive local authorities. The first article has been 
contributed by Nikolay Medvedev, head of the department for 
relations with regions at the administration of the president. 
  According to Medvedev, the new constitutions says that 
"state 
power in the country has two levels: the level of the federal 
state power and the level of power of subjects of the 
federation." He recalls that the division of authority accepted 
in Russia -- the presidential and legislative power -- 
inevitably involved some confrontation, because at that time the 
new constitution did not exist, and "the old principles 
connected with the work of the old system in the person of 
Soviets were in effect ... As a result of it, two systems of 
state power were functioning in the country, whose confrontation 
was unavoidable. Now, the adoption of the new constitution 
created a new legal situation. Dual power in one country was 
eliminated." In his opinion, the main task on the current stage 
is to reform the second stage of state power, namely "the second 
link, i.e. state power of subjects of the federation." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments on Ukraine's decision on 
nuclear 
weapons. According to the newspaper, "Ukraine has made one more 
step towards the world community on the path of nuclear 
disarmament." Aside from it, the parliament showed by this step 
that "the reputation of Leonid Kravchuk as the only peace-maker 
in the ruling elite and the all-out supporter of Ukraine's 
nuclear-free status was seriously tarnished." 
  Commenting on the results of President Yeltsin's visit to 
georgia, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA points out that leaders of all 
parliamentary groups of the State Duma sent a letter to him, 
expressing their "concern over the signing of the 
Russian-Georgian Treaty of Friendship." "The existence in the 
draft treaty of the provisions involving the signing in the 
future of agreements on 'assistance in the purchasing of 
armaments, military hardware and technologies' may, in our 
opinion, destabilise the situation," the letter said. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article dealing with 
Russian-American cooperation in space exploration. Thus, 
according to its information, an expedition of an American 
astronaut on board the Soyuz spacecraft is planned for 1995. 
About ten flights of American spacecraft of the shuttle type to 
the Russian Mir orbital station are scheduled for the period 
between 1995 and 1997. Then the two countries will begin the 
construction of an orbital station with an entirely new design 
(now it is tentatively called Alfa).

  [Text] Moscow February 7 -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to the yet insecure Georgia, the election of a 
pro-Russian president in the Crimea, which is an apple of 
discord between Russia and Ukraine, and the tragic events in 
Sarajevo last Saturday were in the focus of the Russian 
independent television's Sunday analytical programme Itogi. 
  All these major events took place beyond Russia's boundaries 
but were very closely linked to the Russian domestic political 
life, Itogi host Yevgeniy Kiselev said. 
  The bloodiest tragedy of the civil war occurred in Bosnia 
last week, where an explosion in the market place in Sarajevo 
killed 68 people and injured nearly 200. According to Kiselev, 
the event prompts an association with the tragic shot in 
Sarajevo in 1914, which triggered off the first world war. 
  The attitude of the world community to the conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia began to change radically lately, Itogi said. 
Calls to lift the blockade of Sarajevo, besieged by the Serbs, 
are becoming increasingly frequent, as well as calls to use 
armed forces for the purpose. But some experts believe that the 
use of the military could make the knot of the conflict still 
tighter. Extremists are seeking to goad politicians into making 
ill- considered decisions, Kiselev said. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its indignation at 
the 
act of terror in Sarajevo, Itogi said. The ministry said in a 
statement that a prompt and impartial investigation should be 
conducted immediately and those guilty should be punished 
exemplarily, regardless of who they are. 
  Within the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Russian- 
Georgian summit was undoubtedly the key event, Itogi said. 
According to the ITV correspondent, who covered Boris Yeltsin's 
trip to Tbilisi, it was "a strange visit", whose high-sounding 
declarations left unanswered the key question about Russia's 
strategy in the Caucasus. 
  ITV experts and presidential council members Emil Pain and 
Andrannik Migranyan commented on the visit. The upshot of their 
comments was summed up by Kiselev as follows: Many specialists 
view the visit as Yeltsin's desire to extend personal support to 
Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  During Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi, twenty-five documents 
were 
signed. Of prime importance was the Treaty of Friendship, 
Goodneighourliness and Mutual Assistance, the significance of 
which was seen in different light by various political parties. 
  According to Sergey Shakhray, the preservation of the 
Georgian state's integrity met Russia's strategic interests. 
But Shakhray pointed out that the flame of the civil war in 
Georgia could be extinguished only through the recognition of 
the federal character of Georgia and the granting of more 
autonomy to Abkhazia, Ajaria and Ossetia. 
  Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy criticised 
the treaty caustically. "We do not have such a state as 
Georgia," he said straightforwardly. 
  Russia's Choice Chairman Yegor Gaydar expressed concern over 
the transfer of Russian arms to Georgia. He said these weapons 
could be used to bolster the internal strife. 
  Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov said this document 
"can destabilise the situation in the entire Caucasus". 
  According to Pavel Felkengauer, an analyst for the newspaper 
SEVODNYA, "Russia is more and more getting involved in conflicts 
which it is unable to resolve. Russia's policy in the region is 
undergoing continuous changes. Russia does not have a well- 
thought-out military political conceptual framework for its 
actions in the Caucasus." 
  The presidential elections in the Crimea, another major 
event 
last week, brought to power as the Crimean republic's first 
president a pro-Russian nationalist Yuriy Meshkov. The 
electoral campaign on the Crimean peninsula was accompanied by 
"an unprecedented wave of crime," Kiselev said. 
  Yuriy Meshkov said in an interview directly after the 
results 
of the elections became known, that one of his first steps would 
be to sign a trade and economic agreement with Russia and to 
work towards a qualitative improvement of relations with Ukraine. 
  According to some experts, the results of the elections in 
the Crimea have raised a question about the preservation of 
Ukraine's territorial integrity and have posed a threat of 
disintegration which can provoke a conflict on an unprecedented 
scale. 
  Chairman of the Ukrainian Popular Movement Vyacheslav 
Chernobyl declared that Ukraine "should not have permitted the 
presidential elections in the Crimea. Former Ukrainian Prime 
Minister Leonid Kuchma said "neither Moscow nor Kiev has any 
reason for playing the Crimean card. Because any dispute 
between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea would be tantamount 
to the greatest tragedy". 
  A public opinion survey has revealed that 58 per cent of 
those polled reject the possibility of a Russian-Ukainian 
conflict over the Crimea, Itogi reported. Nonetheless, "The 
tension is likely to increase in the triangle 
Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol because of the growing nationalist 
tendencies in the Crimea, Ukraine and Russia. 
  Itogi interviewed Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belarusian 
leader who was sacked by the parliament but said he did not 
intend to leave the political arena. He said he pinned all his 
hopes on the new elections. As concerns relations with Russia, 
he said the parity of prices, above all those of energy 
resources, was one of the chief aspects. "We are spending 14 
per cent of our budget to clean up the effects of the Chernobyl 
tragedy, while Russia is spending a mere 0.5 per cent. This is 
not quite fair, if you see what I mean", Shushkevich said. 
  Itogi reported on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's trip to the former 
Yugoslavia, during which he advocated the establishment of the 
East- European community of all Slav peoples. 
  Voskresenye reported the celebrations of the 90th birthday 
of 
outstanding Russian test pilot Valeriy Chkalov, remembered in 
Russia and the United States. One of his colleagues, 
Colonel-General Baydukov recalled their flight across the North 
Pole to the United States in the thirties. 
  Russia's chief prosecutor Anatoliy Kazannik appeared on 
Voskresenye to talk about his recent visit to the Lefortovo 
prison, where he met Ruslan Khasbulatov and others. "I felt 
terribly sorry for these people," Kazannik said.

  [Text] Moscow, 5 Feb -- Reports by some mass media that 
President Mintimer Shaymiyev of Tatarstan has arrived in Moscow 
and is to have a meeting today with President Boris Yeltsin of 
the Russian Federation are factually incorrect, an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned at Tatarstan's permanent mission in Moscow. 
  Such a meeting was indeed planned, the diplomat on duty at 
the mission pointed out, but for a number of reasons it has been 
postponed until a new date can be set.

<F P=106> [Sergey Fedotov report: "Russian-Tatarstan Treaty. </F>
Russians in Tatarstan Worried About Their Fate"] 
  [Excerpts] Talks between Russia and Tatarstan on a treaty 
formalizing the republic's special status will begin in Moscow 
today. The two sides will probably agree that Tatarstan, unlike 
other regions, will become an associate member of the 
federation. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report on the results of the 
talks crowning the post-communist period of tensions in 
relations between Moscow and Kazan once the talks are completed. 
At this stage, however, Russians living in Tatarstan are 
seriously concerned about their fate. [passage omitted] 
  In everyday life, antagonisms between the Russian and the 
Tatar parts of the republic's population are not so striking and 
the authorities have been nearly ritualistically appealing to 
the united people of Tatarstan. It has taken the Tatarstan 
leadership a great deal of effort, however, to keep the Tatar 
national movement, which demands a complete break with Russia, 
within the limits of political correctness. According to 
observers, now it is less "visible" politicians, but still 
advocates of Tatarstan's gradual secession from the federation, 
who are coming to the fore. "On the surface it has really 
become quieter in Tatarstan, but this is only scenery behind 
which a gradual removal of Russians to secondary roles is taking 
place," Yuriy Rostovshchikov, leader of the Social Democrats in 
Kazan and candidate for the State Duma, told your 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. As he put it, this is reflected 
in the "progressive Tatarization of government." 
  According to the "Russian Federation Citizens" movement, in 
a 
republic where Russians make up around 43 percent of the 
population, Tatars account for 92 percent of government 
ministers, state committee chairmen, and administration chiefs; 
77 percent of Supreme Soviet standing commission chairmen; and 
76 percent of rayon administration chiefs. 
  "The trend is such that soon there will be no Russians 
holding government offices or high posts in industry. Then 
mid-level chiefs will have to go, too," said Nikolay Borisov, 
chairman of the Russian National Assembly's Duma. This 
organization has proposed, among other things, the introduction 
of a proportional ethnic representation in legislative, 
executive, and judicial bodies; and a parliament made up of a 
Russian Duma and a Tatar National Assembly. 
  In observers' view, the slogans of Russian patriots may gain 
wide popular appeal among Russian residents of Tatarstan. If 
the plunge in living standards of the republic's Russian 
population (and defense enterprises with a predominantly Russian 
work force are beset by economic woes) causes strikes, that same 
Russian Assembly will find it easy to add nationalist slogans to 
the workers' economic demands.

<F P=106> [Zinaida Chetvertak report: "Russia-Tatarstan Treaty. </F>
Kazan Close to Victory in Dispute With Moscow"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy 
Likhachev held intensive talks with the Russian Government in 
preparation for the meeting between Mintimer Shaymiyev and Boris 
Yeltsin. According to reports received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the 
Tatarstan president is to arrive in Moscow this weekend to 
discuss with the Russian president the final conditions for 
signing an interstate treaty. The document, which will be 
unprecedented for the Russian Federation, will give Tatarstan -- 
one of the most powerful components in economic terms -- a 
special status compared with other regions. 
  Mintimer Shaymiyev's views on Russia's structure differ from 
Boris Yeltsin's. In the Tatarstan president's opinion, the 
federation should be built not from Moscow, but from the 
regions, which will hand over to the center only those powers 
they are unable to exercise on their own. At the same time, 
Mintimer Shaymiyev consistently dismisses charges that the 
republic is going to secede from the federation. "What we are 
standing for is not a secession from Russia, but treaty-based 
relations and a voluntary transfer of a number of powers to the 
center. Tatarstan does not plan to set up its own army, or to 
erect a border, or to quit the ruble zone," he said in one of 
his interviews. 
  Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev conducted talks 
with Viktor Chernomyrdin, Yuriy Yarov, and Sergey Shakhray to 
settle with them the last five agreements on which the treaty 
"On the Delegation of Terms of Reference and Powers of State 
Authorities" will actually be based. There is a total of 12 
agreements, out of which seven were signed last year, when 
Tatarstan had its way by skillfully playing on the conflict 
between the president and the Russian Supreme Soviet. 
  Reports that Tatarstan is ready to take part in the new 
elections for the Federal Assembly scheduled for 13 March and 
that Mintimer Shaymiyev and Farid Mukhametshin are even going to 
run for the Federal Assembly's upper chamber suggest that the 
remaining five agreements will also be signed. Evidently, this 
is the price Kazan will have to pay for a treaty that will 
recognize the sovereignty of a republic where Boris Yeltsin, 
then a candidate for the Russian presidency, made a statement 
that secured him support from the regions: "Take as much 
sovereignty as you can digest." 
  In mid-February Boris Yeltsin will leave for Kazan to reap 
the first fruits of that statement. Afterward, however, no one 
will be able to say whether they will be the last ones or 
whether other republics will follow Tatarstan's suit. 
Predicting whether Kazan's appetites will be satisfied by a 
bilateral treaty will be just as difficult a task. 

<H3>    A list of agreements on the basis of which the treaty 
between Russia and Tatarstan will be concluded </H3>
  Signed in 1993 
  Agreements on the prospecting and production of oil; on 
ownership matters; on the mutual delegation of powers regarding 
defense industries; on customs; on the organization and 
transportation of oil and oil products; on environmental 
cooperation; on education policy. 
  Expected to be signed in February 1994 
  Agreements on the budget; on the banking system; on foreign 
economic activity; on combating crime; on military organization. 

<H5>    Commentary </H5>
  A special relationship between Tatarstan and Moscow has been 
determined primarily by the federal authorities' interest in 
maintaining their influence in a region that is strategically 
important for the Russian economy. It is there that a number of 
Russia's largest monopolistic enterprises, such as KamAZ, 
"Kazanorgsintez," and "Tasma," are located. The republic 
accounts for 40 percent of polyethylene; 34 percent of 
thermoplastic tubes; 100 percent of motion picture and photo 
films; and 53 percent of diesel trucks manufactured in Russia. 
Moscow's considerable dependence on Kazan for various 
industrial products has been compounded by Tatarstan's monopoly 
of military aircraft and helicopter production (Tu-160 Blackjack 
and Tu-22M3 Backfire strategic bombers, Mi-8, Mi-8MTB, Mi-9, and 
Mi-17 multipurpose helicopters). So, serious arguments in a 
dialogue with Moscow have made Tatarstan, along with Yakutia, an 
"ice breaker" in pushing through regional export quotas. Last 
year, the republic was given a quota to export 8 million tonnes 
of oil out of the 25 million tonnes it produced. The federal 
authorities, however, have just as weighty economic trump cards. 
In particular, they may capitalize on extremely scanty natural 
gas reserves in Tatarstan. More important, however, is the 
problem of the republic's independent sales of its production, 
primarily oil. It is not only the need to use Russian oil 
pipelines that matters. Tatar oil, given its high sulfur 
content, does not hold particular interest for foreign 
consumers. This is the reason it is mixed with Tyumen oil to 
obtain a product known on the world market as "Soviet export 
mix."

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Andreyev, Arkadiy Zheludkov, and Valeriy </F>
Yakov: "Terrorists Maintain Tension in Yakutsk, While the 
Authorities Play at Secrecy"] 
  [Text] For three days now the editorial office's 
correspondents have been trying to find out the details of the 
case of the "Retribution" terrorist group which has demanded 500 
million rubles [R] and $500,000 from the government of the 
Republic of Sakha-Yakutia, threatening to blow up vitally 
important facilities in Yakutsk. 
  After the republic Prosecutor's Office instituted criminal 
proceedings in connection with the threats, we contacted Nikolay 
Valentinskiy, deputy prosecutor of Sakha-Yakutia. According to 
our interlocutor, the inhabitants and the law-enforcement organs 
learned of the critical situation in the city from reports in 
the central media. 
  There is no panic in Yakutsk, he said. All enterprises, 
including schools, are functioning normally. N. Valentinskiy 
did not confirm, but nor did he deny the editorial office's 
information that a description had been obtained of one of the 
terrorists, who brought an audiocassette to the mayor's office 
with the "Retribution" group's demands on it. N. Valentinskiy 
refused to supply any other details of the incident, citing the 
ban on providing the press with information until the inquiry 
has been completed. 
  We were unable to obtain any more information from the 
republic Security Ministry office. According to the minister's 
aide, the law-enforcement organs are operating in accordance 
with a special plan. The criminals have not contacted them 
again. There has been no agreement so far on the place or time 
of a meeting. 
  Vladimir Fedyunin, Sakha-Yakutia first deputy minister of 
internal affairs, was more definite. "It is total rubbish," he 
said in connection with the description of the terrorist. V. 
Fedyunin refused to say any more to IZVESTIYA, on the assumption 
that there might be calls from the terrorists' accomplices. 
  Confidential sources reported that information on the 
willingness to make a payment was broadcast on Yakutsk 
television Channel 12 at the appointed hour on 3 February. The 
money was to be collected by someone in a Moskvich car after a 
signal had been given on television. There was no agreement, 
nor could there have been any agreement on the place where the 
money was to be handed over -- our correspondent was citing 
private conversations with republic Internal Affairs Minister 
Valeriy Fedorov and General Prosecutor Vasiliy Kolmogorov. 
  Local law-enforcement organs checked on potential hoaxers 
suspected of similar threats in the past, but they obtained no 
information on the terrorists. According to the law-enforcement 
organs' current data, there have been no reports of any 
"Retribution" terrorist group. 
  There was an earlier occasion, in 1993, when an unidentified 
citizen also called the local authorities and threatened to blow 
up power facilities in Yakutsk unless he received some money. 
It turned out to be a hoax. 
  We were told at the Russian Ministry for Emergencies that an 
aircraft carrying a rescue team and the necessary equipment and 
medicines had been prepared in connection with the situation in 
Yakutsk, in case of unforeseen developments.

  [Text] Moscow February 7 TASS -- The terrorist who 
threatened to explode the key life-supporting installations in 
the city of Yakutsk, north-eastern Siberia, was arrested on 
Sunday [6 February]. Yakutsk Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov told 
ITAR-TASS by telephone on Monday morning that the terrorist was 
a certain Abdulayev, who had been earlier convicted three times. 
  On February 4 he demanded that the republic's government 
deliver 500,000 U.S. dollars and 500 million roubles or else he 
would set off several explosions and commit several other acts 
of terror in Yakutsk. 
  It was soon found out that Abdulayev had planted no bombs. 
It was also established that no group Vozmezdie (Retribution) 
existed: It was an invention of the hardened criminal who 
wanted money to pay off major debts and "enjoy some good 
living", as he put it himself. Aleksey Tomtosov said criminal 
proceedings had been instituted. Specialists of the Federal 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Counter-Intelligence Service 
supposed from the very beginning that the criminal was bluffing, 
but a large-scale operation was launched to make sure that no 
danger threatens the city and its residents.

  [Text] Yuriy Biragov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of

statement. "Their realization would make a further peaceful 
settlement of the relations between the peoples of the two 
republics impossible and reduce to naught the peacemaking work 
done by the leaders of Russia and the provisional 
administration; likewise the accords reached in the course of 
the negotiating process."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>
  [Text] Vladikavkaz February 6 TASS--North Ossetia's first 
President Akhsarbek Galazov assessed the past week as intense 
and fruitful. "Taking part in the work of the Russian 
parliament's upper house, I managed to meet with Russian head of 
government Viktor Chernomyrdin and other leaders of the Russian 
Federation", Galazov told TASS on returning from Moscow. "We 
considered some pressing issues aiming to assist the republic in 
solving social and economic problems", he reported. 
  Commenting on the meeting of the Russian Government 
presidium, which discussed the situation in the zone under state 
of emergency rule in the light of the presidential decree 
extending the state of emergency for another two months, the 
North Ossetian president said "the Russian president's decree 
was been approved but with considerable reservations. A 
deputies' group was set up to gather objective information on 
the spot... I submitted to the Russian Government our proposals 
as for how achieve a peaceful settlement in relations between 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia. These proposals had been approved 
by the republic's multi-national people. The Ossetian side is 
ready to work for improving relations with all neighbouring 
countries. But we must not use force on this way towards peace. 
Force engenders only force", Galazov stressed. 
  The North Ossetian leader flatly rejected the idea by the 
Ingush side of imposing a special rule on the Prigorodniy 
District as the sole possible way to overcome the current 
crisis. Galazov qualified the idea as a gross interference into 
North Ossetia's internal affairs. "The problem of refugees' 
return should be solved not with military help of federal 
authorities, but on the basis of Kislovodsk accords", he said 
referring to the agreements on a complex solution to the problem 
of refugees and forced migrants in Ingushetia and North Ossetia, 
which were reached by the Russian, Ingush and North Ossetian 
delegations in the North Caucasian town of Kislovodsk last 
March. "Of the greatest importance here are conciliation 
commissions now working in each locality of the Prigorodniy 
District", Galazov emphasised. 
  The situation in the zone under state of emergency rule, 
which has been extended for another two months, remains 
relatively calm, TASS was told at the North Ossetian Security 
Council. Military sources confirmed that no conflicts on ethnic 
grounds had been registered there. Russian peacekeeping forces 
and local law-enforcement bodies are in control of the situation.

  [Text] The Russian republic of Karelia is desperately short 
of fuel, according to an officer at the republic's civil defense 
headquarters. 
  The officer told INTERFAX the stocks of residual fuel oil in 
the republic's capital Petrozavodsk and in Medvezhyegorsk would 
only last three days, those in Belomorsk and Segezh for two 
days. Coal supplies in Petrozavodsk would run out in a week, 
those in Medvezhyegorsk in four days, he said. 
  Karelia is unable to pay the firms providing it with fuel 
and 
has asked the federal government for help, the officer said. A 
commission has been set up in the republic to redistribute the 
remaining fuel to keep the central heating systems and larger 
factories going. 
  According to some sources, the Karelian government was due 
to 
meet on Saturday to discuss emergency measures. 
  The temperature in the republic, which lies in northwestern 
Russia, has these days been staying at between minus 18 and 20 
degrees Centigrade.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Vinogradov] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok February 7 TASS -- Russia's Far East is 
suffering from the cold and this suffering is further aggravated 
by the disruption of fuel and energy supplies. The Federal Fuel 
and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik has had to fly to Khabarovsk 
in order to try and solve the most pressing problems "on site". 
  According to specialists, all enterprises in this vast 
region 
are likely to stop unless emergency measures are taken promptly. 
The cities will have to live without electricity for ten hours 
every day, and the local thermal power stations will use up all 
the electricity to keep going. 
  The Russian Maritime Territory needs about 47,000 tonnes of 
coal every day to keep its electricity-generating plants going. 
At present, the daily supplies have dwindled to 23-25 thousand 
tonnes, and the emergency reserves are vanishing. This is why 
electricity supplies have to be cut off in the evenings and the 
major cities, including Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Ussuriisk and 
others are plunged in the shadows one after another in the 
evenings. In many houses and departments the average 
temperature never rises about 6-7 degrees centigrade. 
  The energy crisis is largely due to the epidemic of 
non-payment, although the federal government adopted a 
resolution on October 8, 1993 to bring about "emergency measures 
of support of the Maritime Territory". The federal budget owes 
more than 30 billion roubles to the coal producers. The 
coalminers in the territory are owed 19 billion roubles in wages. 
  Last year the Primorugol Association was unable to purchase 
a 
single mechanised set of machinery. The machinery and equipment 
now used by the miners are wornout and even at full capacity 
produce a million tonnes of coal less than planned. 
  The federal government delivered 35 billion roubles to the 
territory but the money was fully spent to pay for earlier 
supplies.

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Gypylov report: "Not To Die in Friendly Embraces"] </F>
  [Text] Irkutsk -- At the beginning of February reciprocal 
nonpayments between power workers and miners have sharply 
complicated relations between Irkutsk Oblast and Krasnoyarsk 
Kray. 
  The miners of Irsha-Borodino Open-Cut Mine, in Krasnoyarsk 
Kray, seem to be on the point of stopping sending coal to their 
consumers, including Irkutsk Oblast. To hit its heat and 
electric power stations below the belt, as the saying goes. You 
can imagine what kind of a situation is being created in that 
complex.... In addition, its own "Vostsibugol" miners are also 
in a prestrike state. 
  What complaint is being advanced from the two fronts? 
Reciprocal nonpayments. The power workers are in the same 
trouble. What money can they demand from Bratsk Industrial 
Complex, let us assume, when it is on the point of being reduced 
to beggary? 
  As regards the non-delivery of Borodino coal, Oblast 
Governor 
Yuriy Nozhikov has already promised to "introduce 
countersanctions." For example, to stop the supply of 
electricity to Krasnoyarsk's industrial enterprises. No, they 
have not yet fallen out with each other: They are continuing to 
seek ways to resolve the problem of nonpayments, and they also 
intend to hold consultations with the Russian Federation 
Government. The situation is difficult, although it should not 
be overdramatized. There is still a hope, although it might be a 
naive one: They are, after all, neighbors. For only yesterday 
they were championing their interests at the federal level. 
Today this is necessary at the local level. However "wild" the 
market might be, the governor is right: "We will never give up 
the defense of the region's interests. We will say that we 
cannot increase or reduce the run-off of water to the 
hydroelectric power station without affecting the interests of 
Yenisey River shipping. We will not encroach upon each other." 
Or the gram of coal and the kilowatt-hour of electricity, which 
are essential to the people, will still prove to be serious 
arguments, and financial chaos will divide the Siberians along 
their own banks -- the banks of the Angara and the Yenisey.

  [Text] Vladivostok February 7 TASS -- Seven northern 
regions of Russia's far eastern Maritime Territory have joined 
in an economic union, which "has nothing to do with separatism," 
according to deputy administration chief of the Maritime 
Territory Fedor Konyukhov. 
  "The commonality of the geographic location and economic 
problems necessitate the consolidation of efforts in the 
interests of the entire territory. The most pressing task is to 
revivify the timber, mining and fur industries and to combat the 
plunder of natural riches and their illicit export," Konyukhov 
said. 
  According to Konyukhov, the new organisation will form an 
economic mini-community within this component part of the 
Russian Federation. It pursues no political aims. 
  Work is under way on the charter and programme of the 
economic union which are expected to be approved by the second 
joint session of the heads of administrations. The organisation 
will be funded from the budget of the territory and its 
component parts.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 5 Feb -- Captain First Rank Aleksandr 
Rodkin, Nikolayev senior sea commander, and his subordinates 
have prevented the removal of materials and capital equipment 
from the supply depot of the local Black Sea Fleet hospital 
base. The attempt was made yesterday by the management of a 
vessel construction team, quoting an instruction by the Black 
Sea Fleet command. 
  Reporting this fact, the press center of Ukraine's Navy 
recalls that the day before, on 3 February, base personnel 
informed the Ukrainian Navy and Black Sea Fleet commands, as 
well as Ukraine's Defense Ministry about its decision to 
transfer to the Ukrainian Army to serve the people of Ukraine, 
since both commissioned and non-commissioned officers had lost 
all hope for a civilized solution on the part of the fleet's 
command to the problem of dividing the Black Sea Fleet and, 
consequently, to their social problems. 
  In its own commentary on the incident, the Black Sea Fleet 
press center notes that the fleet's command does not object to 
servicemen joining the Ukrainian Army, but the materials and 
capital equipment must remain with the fleet until the 
presidents of Ukraine and Russia make an appropriate decision on 
the division of the fleet property. 
  Employees of the hospital base complain of an ongoing 
removal 
of materials and equipment from the supply depots. They say 
they are trying to prevent any new attempts to seize the stock.

  [Text] A UKRINFORM correspondent reports from Nikolayev 
that all is quiet today at the local hospital base. However, 
the unit commander has organized a 24-hour tour of duty by the 
unit personnel, maintaining regular contact with the local 
military and civil authorities. What caused such precautions? 
  "The hospital base personnel, where citizens of our state 
are 
serving, decided to take an oath of loyalty to the people of 
Ukraine," Aleksey Yutsyuk, deputy commander of the Ukraina 
cruiser, told UKRINFORM-TASS. "But Captain First Rank 
Halaychev, the commander of the Black Sea Fleet ship repair and 
construction team, decided to ban the oath-taking by force. He 
arrived at the base, together with a subunit from the Slava 
missile cruiser sailors, after which his subordinates broke into 
the supply depot and began to load equipment and medicine stored 
there onto their vehicle. However, servicemen of the 
neighboring Ukrainian unit prevented the illegal removal of the 
fleet property." 
  The hospital base personnel eventually did take an oath of 
loyalty to the people of Ukraine. Their commanders are 
currently drawing up papers to report an unauthorized attempt to 
seize the unit's property to the Procurator's Office.

  [Text] A Ukrainian Navy spokesman has denied statements by 
senior officers in the Black Sea Fleet (BSF) that Ukrainian 
servicemen tried to seize a BSF hospital base on Friday. 
  Nikolay Savchenko, head of the Ukrainian Navy press center, 
said the BSF command ordered the removal of all property from 
the storehouses of a hospital base at Nikolayev after the 
officers serving at it applied to join the Ukrainian Navy, 
"having lost any hope that a civilized solution will be found to 
the problem of the Black Sea Fleet." 
  Savchenko said the BSF command was obeying only the orders 
and instructions of the Russian Defense Ministry, though the 
hospital base officers and employees were Ukrainian citizens. 
  "The uncontrolled removal of property from bases situated on 
Ukrainian territory does not help to find a civilized solution 
to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet," Savchenko said. 
  BSF spokesman Andrey Grachev told Interfax on Friday that 
more than 300 Ukrainian military officers, 10 of them armed with 
submachineguns, had burst into the base after officers serving 
at it applied to join the Ukrainian Navy.

<F P=106> [Speech by Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy to the Supreme </F>
Council in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk], Ivan 
Stepanovich [Plyushch], esteemed people's deputies: The degree 
of confidence which you showed in me when you confirmed me in 
the post of minister of defense of Ukraine, and those tasks 
which you set me, oblige me to report to you in an honest and 
dignified manner, not on the basis of instructions and requests, 
attuned to someone's orders, but proceeding from the point of 
view of military and technical reasons supported by our 
scientists -- Ukraine is a state with rocket and space 
capability [raketno-kosmichna derzhava]. We have virtually 
everything for this. We only need to discard the nuclear 
symbolism for the sake of the economy. I am quite certain of 
this. 
  Analyzing our steps on the whole of the complex path to the 
resolution of the nuclear problem in Ukraine, we consider that 
this path has been consistent and on the whole right. This work 
was conducted under the leadership of the Supreme Council. All 
of the legislative acts which were adopted by the Supreme 
Council regarding the nuclear problem show that Ukraine has 
gradually been moving toward a non-nuclear status. 
  I have already reported in detail on all of these steps and 
resolutions at a joint session of the relevant Supreme Council 
commissions. Taking all of this into account, and also the fact 
that strategic nuclear weapons located in Ukraine are not a 
factor deterring an attack by an aggressor on our state nor a 
guarantee of its security, we consider that the next step of the 
Supreme Council of ratifying the START I Treaty on 19 November 
1993 was entirely proper and logical. 
  Esteemed deputies, at the same time you know that the 
relevant reservations in the ratification of the START I Treaty 
by the Supreme Council of Ukraine unfortunately did not diminish 
international tension, but on the contrary complicated the 
problem of strategic nuclear weapons located in Ukraine even 
more, and especially where Russia was concerned. In such a 
situation it was necessary to act in a very considered way. We 
believed that, to the extent that we could convincingly show the 
world and our people the rightness of our legal and other 
actions regarding nuclear weapons, both the international 
prestige of Ukraine and the domestic situation in the state 
would depend on this, and so would the strategic prospect of our 
national security to a considerable extent. 
  Therefore we at the Ministry of Defense believed that of the 
whole set of nuclear issues our main task was to define our 
stance above all on the technical state of the nuclear weapons 
deployed in Ukraine. In the implementation of the resolution on 
ratification of the START I Treaty and the instruction of the 
president of Ukraine by the Ministry of Defense and myself 
personally, the state of nuclear weapons of the 43d missile army 
and (?the) long-range air force was thoroughly analyzed. 
Together with leading specialists and scientists of Ukraine, I 
personally inspected the situation at all nuclear facilities. 
  The work which was carried out allows me to report to you, 
esteemed deputies, the following conclusions, which from the 
point of view of military and technical reasons determine the 
necessity of a gradual withdrawal of nuclear warheads [yaderni 
boyeprypasy], which in accordance with their technical state 
have gone beyond the guarantee service period. 
  I consider that the main thing is that the nuclear warheads, 
with which intercontinental ballistic missiles are equipped, 
constitute very complex technical apparatus, for the creation of 
which a lengthy and extremely expensive process of design, 
testing, and production is needed. To date Ukraine has not had 
the possibility of resolving these tasks. Nor will it have in 
the near future. There is no scientific and production base for 
creating nuclear weapons in our state. There are no ranges to 
test them on, nor specialists in recycling nuclear warheads. 
  And the main thing, esteemed deputies, is the economic 
condition of our state. To continue, one should also take 
account of the fact that a tough and obligatory condition of the 
safe maintenance of nuclear weapons is the uninterrupted 
scientific and technical accompaniment to its operation, which 
consists of constant supervision [kontrol] and regular 
inspection of the state of nuclear warheads (?and of elaborated) 
scientifically grounded technical decisions regarding the 
possibility and conditions for further operation of nuclear 
warheads [yaderni boyevi bloky]. From the practical aspect, the 
design offices and plants, manufacturers of nuclear weapons 
located in Russia, are obliged to carry out such scientific and 
technical accompaniment. But today they are not carrying out 
these measures, and on the contrary are blocking them. 
  It is also necessary to emphasize that the guaranteed 
service 
periods of a considerable number of nuclear warheads located in 
Ukraine are expiring or have already expired. It could happen 
that unsupervised [nekontrolyovanyy] physical processes which 
are occurring in nuclear warheads will be unforeseen, and the 
state of nuclear weapons will become critical. 
  The impossibility of replacing gas reactors, whose guarantee 
service periods have already expired, in nuclear warheads causes 
especial concern. The said reactors are produced in Russia and 
are not arriving in Ukraine. To date more than 300 (?nuclear) 
reactors have accumulated in our state, which need urgent 
replacement. 
  In addition, the storage of nuclear weapons in repositories 
remains a complex problem. Thus, when a large number of nuclear 
warheads are located in nuclear technical units, the level of 
their nuclear safety is lowered and leads to the loss of the 
guarantee of the chief designer. That which is in the 
repositories of the nuclear technical units of the 46th missile 
division consists, together with SS-24 missiles, (?of) 60 
nuclear warheads, the investigation of three of which showed, 
which our president spoke about, that irreversible physical and 
chemical processes are occurring. The extent of the (?danger of 
explosion) of radioactive materials of the warheads is 
increasing drastically. 
  The list of violations determining a critical state of 
nuclear and ecological safety could be continued. Taken all 
together, they could lead to an accident, the consequent scale 
of which could potentially exceed the Chernobyl disaster. 
Esteemed deputies, I pray to God not to let this happen. 
  One cannot not emphasize that the state of nuclear safety 
is also affected by the condition of missiles, the servicing of 
which is also not fully carried out and with violations of the 
operational demands and normative documents, I (?do not) have in 
mind specialists from Russia. The conclusion is that proceeding 
from what has been set forth above, the further maintenance of 
nuclear warheads [yaderni boyeprypasy] on the territory of 
Ukraine presents a danger not just for Ukraine and Russia, but 
also for our other neighboring states in Europe and the Near 
East; in the event of an accident, they will find themselves in 
the zone of radioactive contamination. 
  Thus because of the circumstances of the necessity of 
implementing the demands in the resolution of the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine on ratification of the START I Treaty 
concerning conducting further talks, meetings, and accords -- as 
a result of this the trilateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, and the appendix to it, 
are a necessary and logical step in the matter of Ukraine 
acquiring a nonnuclear status, and on the whole resolve 
positively all military-technical issues of nuclear weapons in 
Ukraine. 
  We believe that with the aim of guaranteed implementation of 
the demands of the trilateral statement and the appendix to it 
it is necessary during further talks with the Russian Federation 
to elaborate and sign a number of documents to determine the 
time periods, procedure, and conditions for the transfer of 
Russian nuclear warheads. The following should be included in 
these documents: a schedule for dispatching the first group of 
nuclear warheads over 10 months; an agreement regarding the 
procedure and conditions for supervision on the part of Ukraine 
over the dismantlement and recycling of nuclear warheads at 
enterprises of the industry of the Russian Federation; an 
agreement on compensation to Ukraine on the part of the Russian 
Federation for the value of the transferred warheads; an 
agreement on warranty inspection and servicing by the 
manufacturer of the state of nuclear warheads over the whole 
period of their being in Ukraine, including the process of 
transportation to Ukrainian S facilities and to bases at plants 
of Russia's industrial enterprises; a protocol on the mutual 
obligations of Ukraine and the Russian Federation regarding the 
grouping of strategic nuclear forces in Ukraine and conditions 
of joint supervision over the state of nuclear missile weapons. 
  (?As regards) equal relations over the period of the 
reduction of nuclear weapons with states of the nuclear club, 
including with the United States, and after the START I Treaty 
comes into force and Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty of 1 July 1968, they should be 
equivalent to those measures which are taken concerning 
supervision of the reduction of nuclear armaments by every 
state, and incidentally under the supervision of our specialists. 
  I consider, esteemed deputies, that I should draw your 
attention to another aspect of the nuclear problem. This is 
about the fact that, notwithstanding the reduction of strategic 
nuclear weapons, we will have a very careful attitude to keeping 
the personnel and infrastructure of the 43d missile army. This 
is in general of great value, I mean both the specialists and 
the material base. All of this can in the very near future be 
successfully used, not just in the interests of the state's 
military security, but also for civilian needs. 
  I believe that the accords achieved by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia in Moscow on 14 January 
of this year on the whole resolve positively virtually all 
military-technical issues of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which 
satisfies the conditions of nuclear disarmament determined in 
the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 July [as 
heard] 1993. And I would ask you, esteemed deputies, to support 
the proposals of our president. Thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko at the Supreme </F>
Council session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed deputies, esteemed president, esteemed 
Ivan Stepanovych. You understand that the question or the whole 
problem of nuclear weapons that are located in Ukraine remains, 
for the moment, the most important problem. I would like to 
begin by saying that after the Supreme Council's ratification of 
START I, neither Russia nor the United States recognized the act 
of ratification as though it had taken place. Obviously, this 
is why we were forced to deal with an extraordinary situation 
and forced to resolve, in a short period of time, exceptionally 
complex issues. I would like to say that the situation 
developed in a very complicated way. Since the first days of 
Ukraine's independence we had never felt such intense 
international pressure, the main aim of which was to isolate us 
as quickly and as broadly as possible internationally. The main 
thing that is almost completely unacceptable and was 
unacceptable and which provoked the toughest reaction was the 
refusal by Ukraine to accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT]. On this issue I would like to assure you that 
there is an absolute consensus by CSCE member countries. The 
treaty should be universal and undoubtedly extended for an 
unspecified period. We have been given to understand that by 
refusing to accede to the NPT, Ukraine is joining a group of 
states that do not have a very high rating in the world and many 
of the world's democratic countries are talking about this. The 
second thing is that doubt was cast on the very fact that 
Ukraine would ratify the START treaty and a rumor was spread 
that Ukraine was reviewing its policy of attaining nonnuclear 
status as set out in its basic foreign policy documents. 
Obviously great harm was inflicted on Ukraine's international 
image. I will be frank. To achieve glory as an unreliable 
international partner that fails to abide by its promises -- 
moreover a country that is only two years old -- is a very 
disadvantageous and I would even say almost hopeless situation. 
To remain without support in the world community, even if one 
thinks one is right, is a losing game. You do not have to go 
far for examples. 
  I would like to note separately that President Leonid 
Makarovych Kravchuk's position on this, which he announced in a 
speech soon after the ratification of the START treaty, is 
exceptionally important. It was really an important political 
and diplomatic step. Thanks to it we managed to avoid, without 
any exaggeration, serious complications. Such a position left 
the doors open for us for contacts and for future work. How did 
our foreign policy department act under these conditions? I 
would like to tell you, esteemed people's deputies, that 
practically in the first hours following the ratification of the 
START treaty, the ministry began work on explaining the content 
of the Supreme Council's resolutions and the motives that caused 
it to raise the reservations at the time of ratification. 
[passage omitted] 
  You recall the phrase spoken by our president, Leonid 
Makarovych: It is the first time that I experienced the 
difficult situation that Ukraine was fated to endure at the 
beginning of December 1993. We did not broadcast this widely. 
We could not do this because we understood that the nation 
might not be able to withstand all this. We dealt with this and 
worked on it calmly and took it to its conclusion. Esteemed 
deputies, international isolation -- and I would like to place 
particular emphasize on this -- creates such an attitude in the 
world toward an isolated country that any kind of forced methods 
against it are received as a naturally forced reaction to its 
behavior. As an example, I would like to remind you of the 
course of events on the eve of the war in the Persian Gulf. 
Then the United States and its allies made use of the full 
isolation of Iraq almost six months before the military 
operation to find support for actions throughout the entire 
world community. It was a great mistake not to take into 
account Russia's reactions on the possible transformation of 
Ukraine into a nuclear state. You are aware that such an option 
is not only unacceptable to the political and military 
leadership of that country but also plays the role of a popular 
slogan for those like one of the winners in the recent elections 
who support the transformation of Ukraine into a new Russian 
province [huberniya]. In this connection I would like to return 
to the key issues for our security and future as an independent 
state, the value of nuclear weapons as a restraining factor. 
Foreign experts and the overwhelming majority of those who 
understand these things tell us that the only weapon capable of 
halting aggression is the one that can be put to real use by 
inflicting unacceptable harm on the aggressor. Not only us, but 
all nuclear states know that Ukraine does not have operational 
control over the nuclear weapons located on our territory. 
[passage omitted] 
  I would also like to dwell on safeguarding Ukraine's 
interests and above all the national security of our state. It 
seems that the state of our economy clearly underlines an 
obvious and undeniable truth or thesis that is only too obvious 
today: that the main component of any state's security is a 
healthy economy and sociopolitical stability in society. If 
this does not exist, no kind of nuclear weapon, even if it is 
controlled and reliable, will help. The example of the former 
USSR serves as an example, and Leonid Makarovych spoke about 
this. We must consider whether we can preserve independence 
achieved at this price if, having found ourselves in isolation 
and without friends in the world, we encounter a situation where 
supplies of energy sources and in particular of nuclear fuel, 
are completely cut off and every kind of economic cooperation is 
frozen. Could we survive for long? [passage omitted] 
  We will be frank, esteemed deputies. It is a serious and 
difficult political decision but I am certain that it is the 
only one possible under the present conditions. It is about 
preserving not only Ukraine's positive image in international 
relations but about the very survival of our state. Thank you 
for your attention.

  [Text] Having removed the reservations to Article 5 of the 
Lisbon protocol to the START-1 treaty, the Ukrainian Parliament 
has confirmed Ukraine's intention to join shortly the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear country. This 
statement was made by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko 
in Kiev Friday at the meeting with diplomats and journalists. 
  He has said that the absence of the decision on joining the 
treaty should not be interpreted as a negative attitude to the 
document. The issue is still on the agenda, believes the 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister. 
  The parliament resolution, said the Minister, opens the way 
to the implementation of tripartite documents on nuclear 
disarmament, involving Ukraine, the United States and Russia. 
Zlenko believes that it is planned to hold shortly bilateral 
and tripartite talks of experts on the implementation of the 
Moscow documents. He said that the date for the talks is about 
to be set. 
  Zlenko believes the parliament resolution will provide the 
possibility to boost the negotiations with international 
financial organizations to offer Ukraine effective economic aid. 
The Minister also pointed to the need to speed up the financial 
and economic aid to Ukraine. 
  "I am absolutely sure," he said, "that the treaty should not 
be an obstacle to providing aid to Ukraine," said Zlenko. 
  The wording of the resolution's second provision 
unambiguously points to the fact that the exchange of the 
instruments of ratification on the START-1 treaty will be the 
first step. At the same time, he said, the parties involved 
will negotiate concrete intergovernment agreements which proceed 
from the reservations contained in the parliament resolution of 
November 18, 1993. 
  Asked by Interfax-Ukraine about possible debates in 
parliament over the timetable for Ukraine joining the treaty, 
Zlenko did not rule out that the present parliament would also 
consider the issue.

  [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko deemed 
the adoption by the Ukrainian Supreme Council of a resolution on 
withdrawing reservations to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol to 
be an important event. Speaking at a news conference held at 
the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry today, the minister emphasized 
that an important fact about this resolution is that the Supreme 
Council positively evaluated steps taken by the Ukrainian 
president and Government directed at implementing 
recommendations suggested by the Ukrainian parliament, which was 
reflected in the tripartite declaration and a supplement to it. 
It should be stressed, Anatoliy Zlenko noted, that by taking 
back its reservations to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council reconfirmed Ukraine's intention to 
join the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state. 
He also explained that the fact that the resolution did not 
contain a decision to join the Nonproliferation Treaty should 
not be understood as the legislature's negative attitude toward 
the treaty in principle, but as its intention to examine this 
issue at a separate session. This proves, Anatoliy Zlenko said, 
that the issue of joining the treaty has not been taken off the 
agenda.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Parishkura report from Kiev under the "SALT" </F>
rubric: "Ukrainian Parliament Concerned Over Compensation for 
Nuclear Bomb. Defense Minister Warns About Possible Catastrophe"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the Ukrainian Supreme Council tasked the 
Council of Ministers with "stepping up efforts" to sign specific 
treaties on compensation for the nuclear weapons to be removed 
from Ukraine. As for Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, it was decided to consider the question 
at a separate Supreme Council meeting. Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko said that "Ukraine has considerably tarnished 
its image as an international partner by reneging on its 
promises." Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy sweetened the 
pill by saying that Ukraine is a powerful space state that will 
in time be capable of manufacturing delivery vehicles and 
weapons on its own. But later he said that the storage time of 
the combat nuclear blocs, where uncontrollable physical 
processes may begin, is drawing to an end and that "the 
Chernobyl catastrophe would pale beside what might happen." 
  Mr. Kravchuk, on his part, said that he received a telegram 
from U.S. President Clinton on 3 February saying that the United 
States plans to double its aid for dismantling nuclear weapons 
in Ukraine.

  [Text] Kiev -- "RUKH-PRESS" has reported that the first 
official meeting of William Miller, the U.S. ambassador to 
Ukraine, and Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the People's Movement 
of Ukraine [Rukh], took place on 4 February. After the meeting 
they informed Ukrainian and foreign journalists about the main 
subjects of the conversation. The opposition leader informed 
the ambassador in detail about the purpose of Rukh's activity 
and shared his views on the current political situation. 
Vyacheslav Chornovil said about the Supreme Council resolution 
of 3 February that "although Ukraine was not even preparing to 
become a member of the Nuclear Club, the rate and conditions of 
forced disarmament were determined without taking into account 
the interests of the Ukrainian side." However, observed the 
Rukh chairman, it is still not too late to correct the situation 
with additional agreements. 
  Replying to William Miller's question regarding Rukh's 
attitude to the latest events in the Crimea, the opposition 
leader stressed that the creation of a territorial autonomy, and 
moreover, the holding of presidential elections vividly show the 
incapability of Ukraine's leadership, headed by Leonid Kravchuk, 
to secure territorial integrity or to build a unified 
independent Ukraine. 
  William Miller, the U.S. ambassador, expressed concern at 
the 
disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, the deputy chairman of 
Rukh. "His disappearance is a tragedy, and it is very 
unfortunate that no one is reporting information about the fate 
of this person," noted the diplomat. 
  The ambassador did not say a single word about an increase 
in 
U.S. assistance to Ukraine after the signing of the trilateral 
statement, which Leonid Kravchuk and Anatoliy Zlenko spoke about 
in the Supreme Council on 3 February.

  [Text] At the latest plenary session in Vienna of the 
permanent committee of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] Yuriy Kostenko, the head of 
Ukraine's delegation, commented on a statement by Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  In his speech Yuriy Kostenko especially drew the attention 
of 
the representatives from CSCE member states to Ukraine's deep 
concern that a tendency has recently been discerned in Russia's 
policy toward increasing the toughness of its foreign policy 
course, in particular toward the independent states created 
after the break-up of the USSR. 
  Notwithstanding the statements on the main new threat to 
international peace and security, which Russia describes as 
aggressive nationalism, the Ukrainian representative continued, 
whether it wants to or not Russia is provoking the exacerbation 
of this issue and thus is inciting the citizens of Russian 
descent in other states to expressions of national intolerance. 
  The speech by the head of Ukraine's delegation was 
positively 
evaluated by the delegation from the United States, which 
interpreted it as an attempt at an early stage to facilitate the 
prevention of conflicts emerging on an interethnic basis, in 
particular in the Crimea.

  [Excerpts] Kiev, 4 Feb -- At a news conference on 4 
February, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Boris 
Tarasyuk, his deputy, discussed the Ukrainian parliament's 
approval of the trilateral statement by the Presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on Ukraine's nuclear 
disarmament. [passage omitted] 
  Anatoliy Zlenko said that Ukraine expects $4 billion worth 
of 
aid as a result of its disarmament. As regards nuclear arms 
withdrawal which, according to Ukrainian People's Deputy 
Valentin Lemish, seems to have started already, Tarasyuk said: 
"I declare with all due responsibility that no warhead has 
crossed the borders of Ukraine as yet. Indeed, three warheads 
have been transferred to Russia for dismantling, but only 
because of their disastrous condition and in response to 
experts' demands."

  [Text] Today, Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman Ivan 
Plyushch received British Ambassador Simon Hemans. The 
ambassador delivered a letter from the British-Ukrainian 
parliamentary group, which states that the British Parliament 
and Government welcome the trilateral statement of the U.S., 
Russian, and Ukrainian presidents. Regarding nuclear 
disarmament, the British parliamentarians voice hope that this 
statement will be approved by the Ukrainian parliament. During 
the meeting, Ivan Plyushch noted that it is a matter of great 
importance to consequently carry out the provisions of the 
statement by all the states which signed it. At the 
ambassador's request, the Supreme Council chairman informed him 
of the essential preparations for the elections to a new 
parliament. Some questions pertaining to Ukrainian-British 
relations were also discussed. 
  Ivan Plyushch today also received Greek Ambassador [name 
indistinct]. At the request of the European Union [EU] 
leadership, the Greek envoy presented a letter stating that the 
EU attaches great importance to the trilateral agreement. The 
officials also exchanged opinions on the development of 
Ukrainian-Greek relations. 
  This evening, the Supreme Council chairman received U.S. 
Ambassador William Miller at the latter's request. It was noted 
by the two officials that the Supreme Council has thoroughly 
examined issues related to the results of the meeting of U.S., 
Russian, and Ukrainian presidents, as well as to the signed 
trilateral statement and an addendum to it. Taking into account 
the practical measures which were taken by the president and the 
Government of Ukraine, with regard to the implementation of the 
Supreme Council resolution of 18 November 1993, as well as U.S. 
and Russian steps to meet Ukraine half-way, it was resolved to 
remove the reservations regarding Article 5 of the Lisbon 
Protocol to the START Treaty. It was resolved to charge the 
Government of Ukraine with carrying out the documents of 
ratification for START. In this way, the Supreme Council has 
shown to the world its support for the decisive steps of the 
president toward nuclear disarmament, [words indistinct], and 
opened a path for the government to take concrete steps toward 
carrying out the agreement. Having expressed satisfaction over 
the Supreme Council resolution, the U.S. ambassador informed the 
Supreme Council chairman of the intentions and specific steps 
planned by the U.S. Government to assist Ukraine in promoting 
the process of economic reform.

  [Text] Ukraine's Ambassador to China Anatoliy Plyushko, 
presented Dzhou Syau Pey, deputy director of the Eastern Europe 
and Central Asia department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of the People's Republic of China, with the resolution of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine of 3 February 1994 regarding 
ratification of the START I Treaty. 
  During the conversation, the ambassador emphasized that when 
adopting this resolution, the successful specific measures taken 
by the president and government of Ukraine in resolving the 
problems, which had been the cause of a number of important 
reservations on the part of the Supreme Council when ratifying 
START I in November of last year, (?had come to the fore) in 
parliament. 
  In this context it was emphasized that the accords achieved 
by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States of America, and 
Russia in Moscow, and recorded in the trilateral statement and 
appendix to it, had created objective conditions for the Supreme 
Council to withdraw its reservations. It was stressed that the 
Supreme Council resolution shows the consistency of Ukraine's 
foreign policy course and its faithfulness to its declared 
intention to become a non-nuclear state in the future. This 
peace-loving step by Ukraine will undoubtedly have a positive 
influence on the whole process of nuclear disarmament. 
  Dzhou Syau Pey stated that China has an understanding 
attitude to Ukraine's foreign policy and fully approves of its 
desire and readiness to eliminate the nuclear weapons located on 
its territory. He noted that the Chinese side highly evaluated 
the documents signed by the three presidents in Moscow and 
considers that the resolution adopted by Ukraine's Parliament on 
3 February opens the way to implementing the accords reached by 
them. Dzhou Syau Pey was also acquainted in detail with 
Ukraine's proposal to conduct a world peace conference in 1995 
within the framework of the UN's 50th anniversary celebrations, 
and a memorandum on this issue was also presented.

  [Text] Radio Ukraine World Service has received the text of 
a statement by Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry. It says: 
  An act of terrorism was committed at the Markale market in 
central Sarajevo on Saturday, 5 February, leaving dozens of 
innocent people dead and hundreds injured. The Foreign Affairs 
Ministry of Ukraine resolutely condemns this act of terrorism 
that has considerably aggravated tension in the Balkans, at a 
moment when parties interested in the settlement of the 
Yugoslavian problem are involved in an intensive search for ways 
toward a peaceful solution to the crisis in the region. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry appeals to the United Nations 
for a detailed investigation into the tragedy in Sarajevo and 
urges the warring sides to call an immediate cease-fire, get 
down to the negotiating table, exercise political will, and do 
their best to prevent the Sarajevo events of 5 February causing 
an escalation of military confrontation in the Balkans and 
provoking a geographical expansion of the conflict. 
  This act of terrorism once again raises the issue of the 
need 
for an all-around examination of the Balkan crisis and a 
comprehensive approach to its settlement.

  [Text] Yuriy Meshkov, the first President of the Crimea (a 
self-proclaimed republic within Ukraine) elected last Sunday, 
"optimistically inclines to continue contacts with President 
Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine". He said so in an interview with 
INTERFAX given upon his return to Simferopol from Kiev, where he 
conferred with President Kravchuk on Friday. 
  According to Meshkov, his conference with the Ukrainian 
president passed in a "frank atmosphere" and gave "a new 
impetus" to relations between the Crimea and Ukraine. 
Nevertheless he noted that the problems faced by his republic 
remain the same: The lack of social security, rising crime, the 
Black Sea Fleet. 
  For its part, the press service of the Crimean president 
told 
INTERFAX that Meshkov had returned from Kiev "satisfied with his 
talks there". Right after his visit to Kiev Meshkov went on 
vacation, the press service added. 
  Earlier the leader of the domestic politics service of 
Ukraine's president, Nikolay Mikhalchenko, said that the meeting 
was "open and constructive, and the two sides reached agreement 
easily". 
  Judging by the official communique released after the 
meeting 
by the press service of Ukraine's president, the two sides 
focused on economic issues. During the talks they agreed to 
form a mixed working group representing the Ukrainian and 
Crimean governments, and discussed a mechanism for maintaining 
working contacts between the two presidents. Meshkov outlined 
to Kravchuk a model for developing economic ties between the 
peninsula and its traditional partners - Russia and other CIS 
countries. 
  In the meantime the journalists who saw the two presidents 
have said that after his meeting with Kravchuk Meshkov looked 
"depressed".

  [Text] Kiev -- After talks with the Crimean president on 4 
February, Roman Shpek, minister of the economy of Ukraine and a 
participant in the talks, said at a news conference that "the 
first meeting after the inauguration of the president of Crimea 
and the establishment of contacts proceeded in a normal way" and 
with "caution on the Crimean side." According to Roman Shpek, 
"Crimea has proposed that an economic experiment be conducted 
with the granting of economic independence to the region's 
economy, that is, complete self-financing." 
  The minister of the economy of Ukraine evaluated the desire 
of the Crimean representatives not as an "economic program" but 
more as a "statement of intent." The president of Ukraine 
promised to examine the proposals of representatives of the 
republic of the Crimea on the basis of economic calculations. 
The government will be represented by experts from the ministry 
of the economy, the ministry of finance, the state property 
fund, and the National Bank of Ukraine at talks with the 
Crimeans in future.

  [Text] Yuriy Meshkov, the first president of the Crimean 
peninsula, was sworn in today. Let us recall one interesting 
aspect of his career. As a student at the law faculty of Moscow 
State University, Meshkov wrote his thesis under the supervision 
of Professor [Valeriy] Zorkin. Correspondent Yevgeniy Novikov 
reports on how the inauguration of the Crimean president went: 
  [Begin Novikov recording] The session was opened by Ivan 
Yermakov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet. He asked 
Meshkov to come to the rostrum for his official inauguration as 
president. Meshkov pledged allegiance to the people of the 
Crimea and solemnly swore to abide by the Constitution and laws 
of the Republic of the Crimea. After the inauguration ceremony, 
Yermakov read out congratulatory telegrams to the Crimean 
president. Telegrams were received from Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Gryb, from Yegor Gaydar, Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy, Vladimir Shumeyko, Konstantin Zatulin, the 
presidents of the autonomous republics of the Russian 
Federation, and from Eduard Baltin, commander in chief of the 
Black Sea Fleet. 
  Meshkov delivered an address to the citizens of the Republic 
of Crimea. He assured Crimeans that he would work for the 
further development of Crimea's statehood. Meshkov also 
disclosed that he intended to fly to Kiev immediately in order 
to meet Leonid Kravchuk. After meeting the Ukrainian president, 
Meshkov will go on to Moscow. 
  A recess in the session was declared after Meshkov's speech. 
During the recess, Igor Yezarov, the Crimean president's press 
secretary, held a news conference for Crimean and foreign 
correspondents. Among other things, Yezarov disclosed that 
Meshkov had prepared a number of important decrees, including a 
decree on relay of all Radio Russia and Russian television 
programs to the Crimea. [end recording]

  [Text] Simferopol -- After Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov 
left on a flight for Kiev on 4 February, Crimean 
parliamentarians again raised the issue of canceling the 
moratorium on the referendum on the status of the Crimea, but 
yet again it was not even included on the session's agenda. The 
same fate befell the proposal of Deputy Vadim Kolesnichenko, who 
proposed that Yuriy Meshkov be granted the appropriate powers to 
carry out his election promises (entry into the ruble zone, dual 
citizenship, payment of pensions in karbovantsi, and so on). 
  A debate only developed during the examination of the 
resignation statement of Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of the Crimean 
Supreme Council. His resignation was not accepted. It was 
decided to examine this issue only after Nikolay Bagrov returns 
from his vacation, which he took when he lost the struggle with 
Yuriy Meshkov for the presidential seat.

<F P=106> [Interview with Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the </F>
Crimean Tatar assembly, by Mykola Marynenko; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Marynenko] I asked Refat 
Chubarov about the assembly's possible actions when President 
Meshkov holds a referendum on the status of Crimea. 
  [Chubarov, in Russian fading into Ukrainian translation] We 
have always consistently opposed a referendum on the status of 
Crimea since such a referendum would be held according to the 
same mechanism as before, that is, following the will of the 
majority of the population. We understand that, generally 
speaking, it is a democratic norm. But the current majority of 
the Crimean population and its emergence on the peninsula has 
its peculiarities. That is why the Crimean Tatars have always 
opposed any kind of referendum here which would decide crucial 
matters of Crimea's development, ignoring the will of the 
indigenous people. That is why if the moratorium on referendums 
is lifted, I can definitely say that we will not take part in 
such a referendum. [passage omitted] 
  [Marynenko] I asked the deputy chairman of the assembly 
whether they are relying on Kiev to protect Crimean Tatars if 
Meshkov does infringe on the legal interests of the Crimean 
Tatar people in Crimea. 
  [Chubarov] Given the present situation and the present 
composition of the Ukrainian Supreme Council and the current 
president of Ukraine, there is no relying on that. The events 
of the past three years showed that Kiev took and continues to 
take an indulgent attitude toward separatists, hoping, perhaps, 
that it will somehow bring these forces closer and somehow will 
cool the separatist sentiments in Crimea. Time has proven, 
however, that this only encourages them. Therefore, given the 
present composition of the Ukrainian parliament, there is no 
hoping that Kiev will protect not only the interests of the 
Crimean Tatars but even its own state interests in Crimea in a 
more resolute, but legal, way. 
  To fulfill Ukraine's state interests in Crimea and to solve 
the problems of Crimea is impossible today without solving the 
Crimea Tatar problem.

Actions"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Responding to a question from 
SEGODNYA's correspondent whether the elected and sworn-in 
Crimean president will conduct talks with the Crimean Tatars, 
Yuriy Meshkov said: "If the Assembly is a public organization, 
it must be legalized via registration at the republic's Ministry 
of Justice. And it cannot be a state body because there may not 
be two representative bodies in one republic." 
  For its part, "Ukraine," an association of 40 public 
organizations and political parties, has come out with a 
statement on the Crimean events which says in particular that 
the election of a Crimean president is a violation of Ukraine's 
constitution and a way of "dragging Ukraine into a restored 
Russian empire." The statement suggests that the Ukrainians and 
Tatars living on the peninsula are being subjected to tough 
discrimination. 
  The association called on the Ukrainian president, Supreme 
Soviet, and law enforcement bodies to "give a proper assessment 
of the actions by the Crimean separatists and take adequate 
measures to restore law and order in the whole state."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Todres report under the "Federation Council" </F>
rubric: Senate's Needs Are Modest. Shumeyko's Salary Will Equal 
Chernomyrdin's"] 
  [Text] A deputy who is to sign up to work for any 
committee of the parliament's upper chamber will now be paid the 
same monthly salary as a minister -- this is today a little more 
than 300,000 rubles [R]. This was decided yesterday by the 
Federation Council, which got down to tackling the unpopular 
question of providing sustenance for itself and made a serious 
attempt to put its needs within more or less modest limits. 
Following this principle, the salaries of committee chairmen 
will be the same as those of vice premiers, and those of vice 
speakers will be the same as those of first vice premiers. The 
pay of Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko will become level with that of 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  Until then, according to the "Temporary Rules," each senator 
will receive five minimum monthly salaries (that is, R70,000) a 
month for "deputy expenses," or mailing, printing, and so on. 
As of yesterday, however, every one of them has the right to 
hire any number of assistants provided their total pay does not 
exceed 80 minimum monthly wages, or R1.12 million a month. 
Curiously, in order not to scout for personnel around the 
capital, it was suggested to the new parliamentarians that they 
take a look at the lists of the now unemployed assistants of the 
former body of deputies. 
  The bulk of expenses will naturally fall on the senate's 
staff. Its final structure has not been determined yet. At any 
rate, it has been decided that at first each of the Federation 
Council committees will employ 12 persons. 
  The main supporting force will be the chamber's general 
staff: the staff head and three of his deputies will be in 
charge of an analytical center, three legal departments, 
departments for information technologies, relations with 
Federation components, international departments, and a press 
center, plus the inevitable personnel department, general 
affairs, logistics, and other departments. According to 
Vladimir Shumeyko, nearly 400 persons will thus get jobs. 
Importantly, the number is primarily limited by the lack of 
space in the Federation Council building, the former State 
Committee of Construction building. The staff can be increased 
of course, "if we take over the lean-to, a little building...."

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Yakovlev, the Russian president's </F>
newly appointed representative to the Federal Assembly, by 
Yelena Dikun in the "Presentation" column: "The New 
Plenipotentiary Representative Has No Excessive Ambitions. At 
Least No Political Ambitions"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The well-known lawyer, Professor Aleksandr 
Yakovlev, has been appointed the Russian Federation president's 
plenipotentiary representative in the Federal Assembly. In the 
former parliament the president was represented first by State 
Secretary Gennadiy Burbulis, then State Legal Directorate chief 
Sergey Shakhray, and finally State Legal Directorate Deputy 
Chief Anatoliy Sliva. All three did this duty while continuing 
to work in their regular jobs, failing to achieve any particular 
success in consolidating the president's cooperation with the 
Supreme Soviet. How does the president's new envoy envision his 
role? 
  [Yakovlev] First of all, what is involved is not one 
representative but the creation of the president's 
representative institution constantly interacting with the 
Federal Assembly. In my charge will be a special service with 
20 to 30 employees, mainly jurists. Our work will be centered 
on ensuring the smooth passage of draft laws submitted by the 
president. We shall not just present them for the parliament's 
consideration, as was the case before, but supplement them with 
the requisite comments or organize discussions on them. 
  Furthermore, I hope that with time the service of the 
plenipotentiary representative will be used by the Federal 
Assembly as a feedback channel through which deputies will be 
able to make their proposals or complaints known to the 
president. To prevent the separation of powers from turning 
into a new "confrontation of the branches," it is necessary to 
set up constructive interaction at all working levels, including 
ours. This is where I see my task. Concrete materialization 
will always depend on the initiatives which the constitution has 
granted the president with respect to parliament. 
  [Dikun] Although you are a well-known lawyer, up to now no 
high posts have been offered to you. Lately, if I am not 
mistaken, you have been working in the United States. Why did 
they suddenly remember you in the Kremlin? 
  [Yakovlev] Indeed, recently I have been delivering a course 
of lectures at Emory University in Atlanta; it was devoted to 
our domestic affairs: the evolution of Russian 
constitutionality. Then, presidential administration chief 
Sergey Filatov offered me this post. It is hard for me to judge 
the motives, but it is very important that I collaborate with 
Filatov because we have worked together on the new draft 
constitution and we are on the same wavelength. 
  [Dikun] Your predecessors in this post, Burbulis and 
Shakhray, had reputations as being conflict prone. They did not 
manage to establish good contacts with the parliament. Do you 
believe in your good luck? 
  [Yakovlev] At any rate, I will try to establish rapport. I 
am a fairly flexible man and, what is most important, I believe 
that law serves equally all political forces acting within the 
framework of the legitimate constitution. Moreover, I have no 
personal power ambitions or any ulterior political super-task. 
  [Dikun] Your new duties are largely similar to diplomatic 
ones. You will have to smooth out the rough edges that may 
emerge in relations between the president and parliament, and 
sometimes act in the role of the president's advocate.... 
  [Yakovlev] Legally no such duties have been assigned to me 
and everything here will depend on the president's articulated 
intention. Only he can empower me for such actions. Of course, 
whatever I do, I shall proceed from the presumption of 
constitutionality of the president's actions. It is another 
matter if I am asked to support a particular initiative or 
proposal which in my opinion is not justified by constitutional 
norms: In that event I will immediately tender my resignation 
and go back to the Institute of State and Law, where I have some 
very interesting work to do.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>
  [Text] Today is the last working day of the week for our 
legislature, while the coming week will be a sort of holiday for 
our people's deputies. At today's session, several deputies 
delivered reports on miscellaneous issues. Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Hryb told deputies about the course 
of negotiations with Russian experts on the merger of the 
Belarusian and Russian financial systems. Then, Myechyslaw Hryb 
expressed his opinion on yesterday's increase in prices for 
bread and baked goods. He said that the question of who had 
adopted this decision is being clarified because the government 
had earlier promised that there would be no price increases in 
February. 
  [Begin Hryb recording] We are currently clarifying this 
issue 
along with the government. Why has the production of bread and 
baked goods been cut and who is to blame? We will later discuss 
this issue. In my opinion, we should control all prices. [end 
recording] 
  Later, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich took the floor and 
said that the new prices for bread and baked goods will be 
suspended and those guilty will be punished. Then, the 
lawmakers continued to discuss draft laws. They discussed the 
draft Supreme Soviet decree on limiting the state's foreign debt 
and on the use of foreign credits. This issue is very 
complicated, some financial violations and official abuses have 
been discovered, therefore the decree should foresee that in the 
future these negative tendencies be excluded. The deputies 
decided to continue work on this document. 
  Later, the deputies introduced some amendments and 
supplements to the law on investments in Belarus. Then, the 
Supreme Soviet dismissed Minister of Justice Leonid Dashuk in 
connection with his appointment to a new job. 
  I spoke with People's Deputy Gennadiy Lovitskiy, acting 
chairman of the Belarusian Committee for State Security [KGB]. 
  [Begin recording] [Rudkowski] Gennadiy Mikhaylovich, you had 
to examine the resolution of the Republican Strike Committee 
[BZK] on holding an indefinite political strike. What did you 
learn? 
  [Lovitskiy] According to the Supreme Soviet decision, the 
general prosecutor of Belarus has issued a warrant to 
investigate this issue. The examination of the BZK resolution 
from 26 January, adopted at a joint session of the leadership of 
the BZK Council and its Executive Bureau is being conducted. 
This resolution ends with the following words: All of you 
should fight against this regime! The resolution is signed by 
BZK Chairman Zimin. I want to remind everyone that this 
examination is being performed legally, without any political 
background, I am categorically against it; we will assess its 
legality and take corresponding measures. 
  [Rudkowski] What will happen if the strike is held? 
  [Lovitskiy] If the strike is legal, it will be held. 
Currently, there are different approaches to this issue. I do 
not want to draw any conclusions, we require a legal 
investigation of this document. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow February 5 TASS -- Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich regards as his main political objective the 
restoration of an economic alliance with Russia. In his 
interview with SELSKAYA ZHIZN he refuted allegations that the 
joining of the rouble zone by Belarus is undermining its 
sovereignty, or that this decision means a kind of charity on 
the part of Russia. "In this case those European politicians who 
are working for the introduction of a common instrument of 
payment for europe are bad patriots either," Kebich stressed. 
  In his opinion, the root cause of Gaydar's resignation is 
much deeper than the problem of signing an agreement on the 
unification of monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. "In 
general terms, it could be described as the difference in views 
between the prime minister and the deputy prime minister over 
the way the reform should be developed," he said. 
  The rouble zone will not mean a political and economic 
alliance, it will be nothing but a common financial and monetary 
system. According to Kebich, "in conditions of a common monetary 
system, Belarus will have a chance to follow its own path. The 
same is true of Russia. We have complete understanding on that 
matter with Russian leaders."

<F P=106> [Valentin Zhdanko report under the "Belarus" rubric: "Well. </F>
Just You Wait, `Hare!' Prime Minister Intends To Sign Accord 
With Moscow on Any Terms"] 
  [Text] "The merging of the monetary systems of Russia and 
Belarus is impossible without Belarus' losing its independence 
and statehood," said parliament opposition leader Zenon Poznyak, 
speaking in the Supreme Soviet. He painted grim prospects 
awaiting the country, thinking that if it joins the ruble zone: 
"This would be the capitulation of the Belarus economy and the 
Belarus state to a more powerful Russian capital and 
entrepreneurship. Our enterprises and banks would be swallowed 
up, and the property bought up. In the end, we would remain on 
our soil, but it would no longer belong to us.... We would turn 
into a free-ride corridor for the duty-free transit of Russian 
gas, oil, and raw material to the West." 
  On behalf of the Belarus People's Front, Mr. Poznyak called 
the country's citizens to a nationwide political manifestation 
to demand the resignation of the government, the dissolution of 
the Supreme Soviet, and early democratic elections. He also 
pledged support for the free trade unions and strike committees 
that are preparing a general political strike slated to go ahead 
on 15 February. 
  New Belarus Parliament Speaker Myechyslaw Hryb reacted 
nervously to the opposition statement. He interrupted Mr. 
Poznyak's address with the words: "We do not need such 
documents," and ordered the microphone turned off. 
  In the meantime, the Russia-Belarus expert-level talks on a 
mechanism for the merger of the monetary systems continue near 
Minsk in anticipation of Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit. The 
meeting is taking place behind closed doors. Asked for comments 
on the progress of the talks, Myechyslaw Hryb replied that they 
are proceeding "normally, in a coordinated and orderly way." 
According to reports from informed sources in the Belarus 
Government, the premier intends to sign an agreement on a single 
ruble space in any shape, and on whatever conditions the Russian 
side insists.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Statement of the Belarusian Popular </F>
Front opposition in the Supreme Soviet"] 
  [Text] The Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] opposition in the 
Supreme Soviet has adopted a statement "On the Current Political 
Moment." The statement, in particular, reads: "The so-called 
unification of the monetary systems -- being, in fact, an 
incorporation of Belarus into the monetary system of Russia -- 
is nothing more but an act of disarmament of the Belarusian 
economy and the Belarusian state in the face of the more 
powerful Russian capital and business. Our enterprises and 
banks will be swallowed, our property and national wealth will 
be bought up. The competitiveness of our goods will decrease, 
resulting finally in the stoppage of production. We will become 
an outlet for duty-free passage of Russian gas, oil, and raw 
materials, as well as a place for arms of foreign army and 
nuclear missiles." "The question arises," the statement also 
reads, "why is the nomenklatura government and the Supreme 
Soviet majority supporting the neocolonialist policy of Russian 
orthodox imperial circles and acting against the interests of 
their own state? Because nomenklatura officials are afraid of 
the responsibility for corruption, `grab-what-you-can' 
privatization, the robbery of national property, and the 
destruction of our economy. To avoid this responsibility, they 
are ready to surrender their state. Yet the destructive intents 
of governmental nomenklatura have to be stopped. We should 
prevent the situation, in which our nation is forced to take up 
arms and fight for national freedom and independence, as it is 
done in other countries." The statement underlines that the 
only realistic and legal action in this situation is a mass 
all-Belarusian political rally demanding the recall of Kebich's 
antinational government, the dismissal of the illegitimate 
Supreme Soviet, and the holding of democratic elections. The 
authors of the statement also have an understanding of the 
appeal of the Free Trade Unions and the Strike Committees to 
launch a general political strike.

  [Text] Minsk February 4 TASS -- The Belarusian foreign and 
domestic policy will remain unchanged, newly elected Belarusian 
Parliament Speaker Myechyslaw Hryb told foreign ambassadors to 
Belarus here today. The strategic goals are consolidation of 
independence and transformation of Belarus into a neutral state. 
  In his words, the republic attaches great importance to a 
recent visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton which laid down the 
basis of further bilateral cooperation in the political and 
economic spheres. 
  He also praised negotiations of Vyacheslav Kebich and 
Stanislav Shushkevich with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The speaker said further 
Russian-Belarusian integration with the future unification of 
their monetary systems is a vital necessity without which 
Belarus will collapse. 
  The formation of Russian-Belarusian economic union will take 
several months due to the need to sign 40 agreements.

  [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur signed a decree 
saying that a referendum on confirmation of the republic's 
independence be held with the participation of all Moldova's 
inhabitants on Friday. The referendum is to take place on March 
6. 
  Voters will be required to answer a single question: "Do you 
support that the Republic of Moldova develop as an independent 
and integral state within the borders recognized by the UN, 
pursue the policy of neutrality and maintain mutually beneficial 
economic relations with any state and that equal human rights be 
guaranteed to all citizens in accordance with principles of 
international law?" 
  The Central Election Commission on parliamentary elections 
rejected the president's proposal that the referendum be held 
together with the parliamentary elections on February 27. 
However, the president acted in conformity with the current 
legislature and assumed the responsibility for holding of the 
sociological poll. 
  According to observers in Kishinev, the Moldovan president's 
decision on the referendum was aimed at discouraging those who 
support the idea of unification between Moldova and Romania.

<F P=106> [Anca Florea report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] This evening Radio Chisinau broadcast the decree 
issued by President Mircea Snegur regarding the sociological 
poll titled "Consulting With the Nation" [La Sfat Cu Poporul]. 
  Taking note of the Central Electoral Commission's decision 
of 
2 February, which practically rejects President Snegur's 
proposal that according to the decision of the presidium of the 
Parliament of the Republic of Moldova the aforementioned poll 
should be organized simultaneously with the 27 February general 
elections, but, on the other hand, considering the stringent 
need to stabilize the social, political, and economic situation 
in the country, to create favorable circumstances for the 
strengthening of the independence of the Republic of Moldova and 
the ensuring of its territorial integrity, and on the basis of 
Article 113 of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, the 
president of the republic decrees, I quote the first article: 
  On 6 March 1994 the sociological poll "Consulting With the 
Nation" is to be held on the whole territory of the Republic of 
Moldova. The poll is intended for all citizens of the republic 
with the right to vote to answer the following question: Do you 
favor the Republic of Moldova to develop as an independent, 
unitary, and indivisible state, within its frontiers established 
on the day of the proclamation of its sovereignty, 23 June 1990, 
to promote a neutral policy, to maintain mutually advantageous 
cooperation relations with all the countries of the world, and 
to guarantee equal rights to all its citizens, according to the 
norms of the international right? unquote. 
  The five articles that follow the first one regulate the way 
in which the poll is to be prepared. 
  Also today the Central Electoral Commission held a news 
conference, during which the journalists were told that 1,024 
candidates representing 16 political groupings and 19 
independent candidates have registered for the 27 February 
ballot. The commission members also said that 44 technical 
groups [for ballot counting] have been set up and the voting 
bulletins have also been confirmed. 
  The commission members also emphasized that although they 
had 
done everything they could to organize elections also on the 
left bank of the Dniester River [in the self-proclaimed Dniester 
Republic], as well as in the southern part of the republic 
[inhabited by the Gagauz ethnic minority], for the time being it 
is still unclear whether the elections will also take place in 
those regions.

  [Text] At a meeting presently under way today in Chisinau, 
President Mircea Snegur expressed his opinion about relations 
with Romania by calling for prudence and wisdom, and 
preservation of origins in this era of building brotherly 
relations on the two banks of the Prut River. 
  The following report by Anca Florea details this idea of the 
president of the Republic of Moldova. 
  [Begin Anca Florea recording] As reported, the congress Our 
Home, the Republic of Moldova is being held in Chisinau today. 
It has been organized by the Civic Alliance and the Government 
of the Republic of Moldova. This congress is being attended by 
almost 2,000 people from various social segments and, as the 
deputy Prime Minister Mihai Coscodar specified, guests from 
Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Greece, Switzerland, and others. 
  The congress was opened by writer Ion Druta, after which the 
floor was taken by the president of the Republic of Moldova, 
Mircea Snegur. In a lengthy speech, the president began by 
responding to those who, as he put it, want to eliminate such 
notions as Moldova, the Moldovan language: Moldovan, and the 
Moldovan people from the political vocabulary. 
  President Snegur also referred to the Dniester problem and 
to 
relations between the Republic of Moldova and Romania. Here is 
a passage from President Snegur's speech: 
  He expressed his position, quote: Regarding a problem which, 
I can assure you, concerns all of us, unquote. And then he 
continued, quote: I am speaking of relations with our brethren 
in Romania. The first thing I want to mention is the fact that 
our blood brothers are living beyond the Prut and we industrious 
Moldovan people must first develop our relations with them. At 
the same time, it is my first duty and great honor to tell our 
blood brothers the following: Brothers, with consideration and 
respect, esteem and fraternal love, we want to express heartfelt 
thanks and deep gratitude for the support and assistance you 
have granted and continue to grant us during these trying times. 
  May the Lord help us to jointly survive in this troubled 
world. At a time when the danger of wars is hovering above us -- 
from one or another direction -- we have this fraternal request 
to jointly step forth with honesty and courage, careful 
consideration and caution, wisdom and moderation, dignity and 
mutual respect, which have to be our guides now, when we are 
building our fraternal relations. 
  The historic recollection of sacrifices and losses does not 
permit us to miss this opportunity to be free. Let us lend our 
ear to the wise voice of the people and to their desires, which 
are never wrong. 
  The Moldovan people no longer want to [words indistinct] and 
do not want to hear that their country is coveted as a rich land 
as if it did not have genuine owners, the successors of our 
ancestors. Our people want good understanding with our brothers 
as befits nations, unquote. 
  And now I will continue with another passage of President 
Snegur's speech: 
  Let us preserve our origins, not in a bashful but in a 
dignified way, by not wasting anything that characterizes us as 
Moldovan. Our people want us to prosper and flourish as equal 
nations in this world, unquote. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin"] </F>
  [Text] President Askar Akayev on Thursday formed a security 
council to coordinate activities carried out by appropriate 
agencies in the field. 
  This advisory board, as the presidential decree notes, is 
assigned to draft presidential decisions on republican security, 
plan anti-crime campaigns, consult the president on the 
republican health service, forecast and prevent emergencies and 
eliminate their effects, and advise the president on everything 
that concerns a state of emergency, including its imposition, 
extension, and repeal. 
  The council comprises the prime minister, chairman of the 
commission for emergencies in the rank of deputy premier, power 
ministers, national guards commander, presidential 
administration chief, and president's national security adviser. 
The board, which will meet once a month, can invite the 
Parliament's Speaker and other persons. 
  Conferring with the power ministers on Thursday, Akayev 
pointed to shortcomings in the fight against crime and said that 
after the credit of trust from the voters he would spare no 
effort to restore order in the republic. He gave instructions 
on drafting decrees to this effect. 
  Akayev also had a closed meeting with the finance minister, 
taxation and custom service chiefs, and other officials to 
discuss ways of collecting taxes and securing finances. It was 
noted that sizable revenues were lost because many enterprises 
had been evading taxes. For this reason, Akayev threatened to 
deal ruthlessly with tax evaders, whose actions, as he put it, 
"undermine the security of the entire state."

  [Text] As reported in the press, an IMF delegation is 
visiting Kyrgyzstan. The delegation, led by Peter Voeller, is 
providing the republic with technical assistance for the 
implementation of socioeconomic reforms. 
  The delegation was received by Askar Akayev, the president 
of 
the Kyrgyz Republic. 
  IMF representatives expressed serious concern over the way 
reforms were being implemented. It was noted that due to a 
sharp reduction in tax revenues, a most complex situation had 
taken shape regarding the formation of the income part of the 
budget, which cast doubt on the government's ability in the near 
future to continue paying salaries to teachers, doctors, and 
other employees paid from the budget. 
  Akayev thanked members of the delegation for the work they 
had carried out, pointing out that he shared their concern and 
expressed his opinion about the issues discussed. 
  As a result of a dialogue that took place, a certain 
compromise was reached. It envisages a lower inflation rate, 
which Kyrgyzstan should achieve by reducing the budget deficit, 
a stricter credit and monetary policy, and a harsher financial 
discipline. If these conditions are met, the IMF will be ready 
to consider a program of further financial assistance on 
preferential terms.

  [Text] Yerevan -- T. Gdlyan, chairman of the Russian 
People's Party, who is in Armenia on family business, has given 
his prediction regarding the development of political events. 
He put forward two possible avenues: "Zhirinovskiy may quite 
possibly prefer a bloc with the Agrarians and the Communists in 
order to combat the democrats. But, once it has conquered the 
latter, the coalition would inevitably fall out among 
themselves." 
  Gdlyan believes that there are definite Western forces and 
mafia structures behind Zhirinovskiy. Touching on the subject 
of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's 
possibly coming to Armenia, he said that he has information that 
Zhirinovskiy receives financial backing from a number of 
influential Armenian businessmen in Armenia as well as in Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy head of the </F>
Russian counterintelligence service, by corrrespondent Yevgeniy 
Kiselev, with introductory remarks by Kiselev and Oleg Lobov, 
secretary of the Russian Security Council; place and date not 
given; from the "Itogi" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev] A commission for 
appraising the top-ranking officers of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, led by Oleg Lobov, secretary of the 
Russian Security Council, started work on 26 January. The 
commission's task is to decide which of the leading officers of 
the former security ministry will continue to occupy the top 
command posts in the new Russian intelligence service. Among 
the members of the commission are Yuriy Baturin, the president's 
aide on national security issues; Valeriy Rubanov, deputy 
chairman of the Security Council, who took an active part in the 
previous attempt to reorganize the KGB in 1991; and Sergey 
Kovalev, the chairman of the human rights commission under the 
Russian president, a prisoner of conscience in the past and a 
severe critic of security bodies. 
  [Lobov] I think that such a composition of the commission 
makes it possible to draft adequate suggestions on the 
candidates for the top command posts of the counterintelligence 
service, to be endorsed by the president. Some 200 to 250 
people will be appraised. 
  [Kiselev] Those are senior officers? 
  [Lobov] Yes, certainly, those to be appointed by a 
presidential order or decree. I think those who are unsure of 
their position or who are opposed to reform will leave of their 
own accord -- some of them have already left. The people who 
stayed are eager to work. 
  [Kiselev, over video of KGB building in Lubyanka] The 
notorious building in Lubyanka Square where we went for a 
comprehensive interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy head 
of the Russian counterintelligence service, has always been a 
symbol of the VChK, OGPU, NKVD, KGB and finally the former 
Russian Ministry of Security to the Soviet people. However, we 
found out to our surprise that the headquarters of the service 
has recently moved to another building, also in this area. 
  [Stepashin] You see, the heads of the KGB and later of the 
Security Ministry have been working in this building since the 
late 1980s. As for the building you have mentioned, most of it 
is currently occupied by the directorate for the border troops. 
Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev [commander of the border troops] and 
I have agreed that the central entrance, which is always shown 
on TV, the one with the state emblem above it, will have a large 
board saying Border Troops of the Russian Federation. So the 
people who were so annoyed by this building and this service 
should feel gratified. 
  [Kiselev] So, border troops have departed from the Security 
Ministry. Which parts of the former Security Ministry have then 
remained within the structure of the federal counterintelligence 
service? 
  [Stepashin] The counterintelligence itself has remained. 
Therefore, its three main operational directorates will be 
involved purely in counterintelligence work. This will include 
practical measures [operativnyye meropriyatiya], economic 
counterintelligence, and the protection of important state 
installations. In addition to this, our directorate for 
combatting terrorism will also be active. 
  [Kiselev] What about the executive apparatus? Have you 
inherited all of it from the outgoing Security Ministry? 
  [Stepashin] Naturally. What is more, I do not see anything 
wrong in it. It stopped being the KGB long ago -- you know how 
many changes it has gone through since 1991. Many people left 
at that time -- it is another question whether they were the 
worst or the best. So, today, the majority of people who have 
come to work at the Security Ministry will certainly stay. 
People who work here must first and foremost be professionals, 
and they must also believe in the unwritten dictum "to serve our 
country, our fatherland, and our state" -- these are the words 
of the president. 
  [Kiselev] Yes, there is an opinion that the strength of all 
special services is that they are loyal to the existing 
authorities on the one hand and indifferent to the political 
orientation of that power on the other. 
  [Stepashin] This is certainly so. 
  [Kiselev] But are you sure, Sergey Vadimovich, that the 
majority of the staff of the federal counterintelligence 
service, who worked in the Security Ministry in the past and 
before that in the Soviet KGB, is quite neutral politically and 
quite indifferent to the political orientation of the country's 
leadership? 
  [Stepashin] As individuals, as citizens -- of course not. It 
should not and cannot be like that, especially in such a 
politicized country as ours. This is natural and I think normal 
-- after all, they are living people. As for carrying out their 
professional duties, their military duty if you like -- because 
we are all military... 
  [Kiselev, interrupting] What is your rank, by the way? 
  [Stepashin] Lieutenant General. As regards that, I think 
the answer is yes. Moreover, a number of our employees -- I 
will not name them -- including two generals for whom I have 
great respect, simply handed in their resignations after the 
decree of 21 December saying that they had to leave under the 
present circumstances. They acted honestly. We are almost 
halving our numbers, but we are not reducing the numbers of the 
operational counterintelligence units. 
  [Kiselev] But as for external surveillance services and 
services that may tap telephones if necessary, do they remain? 
  [Stepashin] Well... 
  [Kiselev, interrupting] I know this is a painful question. 
  [Stepashin] Painful, why? This is quite a normal question. 
A counterintelligence service without operational and technical 
underpinning does not make any sense. So, we are going to keep 
all these. 
  [Kiselev] Are you also going to keep your system of agents, 
as well as recruit new agents? 
  [Stepashin] Most certainly. Agents form the foundation of 
the entire work of a special service. It is another matter that 
recruiting methods have been changed, are changing considerably 
at the moment. To tell you the truth, in the past, blackmail 
was sometimes used as a recruitment technique, so that when a 
person saw he had no other way out -- he failed to get promotion 
at work, could not go abroad, could not obtain a PhD, could not 
become an academician -- I am speaking in general terms... 
[pauses] Now, today such methods are completely ruled out. 
  [Kiselev] What about people recruited as agents in the past? 
I know the word agent was often avoided then, it was not much 
liked and some called them assistants or some other names... 
  [Stepashin, interrupting] Yes, the secret apparatus... 
  [Kiselev, interrupting] The secret apparatus, that is right. 
And now this argument has been going on for several years. Some 
say: let us identify those who collaborated with the KGB in the 
past, while others say this should not be done by any means. 
  [Stepashin] We shall do all we can to prevent this 
happening. 
First of all, I have already told you that all special services 
in the world employ agents -- all of them, regardless of whether 
the state is democratic, antidemocratic, communist, and so on. 
This is the first point. The second is that we have no right 
to break the promises given to those people. We can simply ruin 
their lives, and those who demand it should think about this if 
they really consider themselves humane people and defenders of 
human rights. And the third point is that there are some laws 
that have not yet been abolished by anyone and that not only 
protect the secret agents but call to account those who attempt 
to declassify this secret network. Therefore, I think this 
should certainly not be done. 
  [Kiselev] But coming back to your principal function, the 
counterintelligence service: counterintelligence means first of 
all, if I understand it correctly, fighting foreign intelligence 
services, that is, counteracting intelligence activities of 
other states on the territory of Russia. How active is this 
work now? It was mentioned at a news conference that foreign 
secret services had attempted recruiting some of the most 
high-ranking state and government officials and that such 
incidents had even been reported personally to the president of 
Russia. Could you talk about this in more detail? 
  [Stepashin] Well, I would not like to talk about this in 
more 
detail. Such attempts have been made, are being made, and will 
continue to be made. And you know, it applies not only to our 
state officials but to rank-and-file citizens as well. They 
simply are not aware that such recruiting attempts are being 
made. This is the first point. Second, we are really seriously 
concerned about a leakage of nuclear, military, and other 
technologies, which today is quite considerable, and about 
attempts to recruit our scientists and experts. We have 
information about many incidents of this kind. These are only a 
few facts that show that foreign secret services are 
intensifying their activities in the Russian Federation. 
  [Kiselev] What about a situation when, for instance, 
reports appear in the press that the Dutch company GMM financed 
Zhirinovskiy's electoral campaign? Is it part of the 
responsibilities of the federal counterintelligence service to 
verify reports of this type? 
  [Stepashin] If we look at it from the point of view of our 
charter and our direct functions, then no. Moreover, you will 
recall that when President Yeltsin signed the decree of 21 
December [on restructuring the Russian security services], he 
said at a news conference before the New Year that he had 
abolished political investigations and everything they are based 
on. But political investigation in its literal meaning is 
activity of special services directed against opposition parties. 
  [Kiselev] Right. How can you draw a line between gathering 
information about organizations that might potentially become 
extremist or begin to threaten citizens' safety, the security of 
the state and society, on the one hand, and political 
investigation on the other? 
  [Stepashin] This is a very subtle matter. Everything should 
be known, but our service will not be involved in active 
measures or operations against opposition parties, movements, 
and organizations. 
  [Kiselev] But it will collect information? 
  [Stepashin] Well, not quite collect information -- or 
perhaps 
yes, collect information. When this party or organization turns 
up here, weapons in hand, and takes over power -- then it will 
be too late. We must be aware of this and must prevent this. 
For this, protective measures must be taken. We must obtain 
information -- including information from the parliament, the 
government, and the president. So, I agree with you on this 
point. Incidentally, 10 days before the final election results 
were published, we conducted our own poll in five regions, and 
we predicted Zhirinovskiy's victory with 23 percent, falling 
short of the actual result by just 1 percent. 
  [Kiselev] Did you make this information known to the higher 
authorities -- the president and the government? 
  [Stepashin] I do not know if it reached the president, but 
we 
did send memos to the leadership with regard to this matter. 
  [Kiselev] At the moment, there is a lot of talk and surmises 
about a new upsurge in the activity of the extreme opposition 
and that there allegedly exists an armed underground opposition 
movement. They say some people went underground after 3-4 
October and that they are armed. How close to reality are these 
reports? 
  [Stepashin] What is real is that unless the promise publicly 
given to the people by the prime minister, the government, and 
the president to stabilize the political situation, to provide a 
normal civilized standard of living for our people is 
fulfilled...[pauses] increasing [opposition] activity is 
certainly a real fact. As for armed formations and other 
attempts to discover an enemy in the army or here, the 
information we have -- and I assure you that we do have serious 
information -- indicates that such things and processes do not 
exist. 
  [Kiselev] Well, thank you very much, Sergey Vadimirovich, my 
list of questions seems to be exhausted.

  [Text] The Party of Russian Unity and Concord (PRUC) [PRES] 
must proclaim itself as a national conservative party, said its 
chairman, Sergey Shakhray, the Minister for Ethnic and Regional 
Policies. In Moscow on Saturday he addressed spokesmen for the 
party's regional organizations. 
  According to Shakhray, the government of Viktor Chernomyrdin 
has to choose between two possibilities: "One is to lean on the 
Communist and Agrarian factions in the State Duma, and the other 
to cut off their unacceptable proposals leading to 
hyperinflation together with the ultra-radical proposals of 
Russian Choice and lean on the centrist bloc which comprises 110 
to 130 State Duma members, including those from the PRUC. [no 
end quote as received] "The Duma can survive and work stably 
only in this way," Shakhray said. 
  According to him, President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin are "the stablest figures" in Russian 
politics today. 
  According to Shakhray, he is not informed of how "the 
president's party", whose prompt emergence was predicted by the 
leader of the president's office, Sergey Filatov, recently, will 
be formed. "There is only one way to form such a party -- to add 
party functions to executive authorities and prop them up with 
political mechanism when laws, decrees and instructions fail to 
be observed," he said. 
  Shakhray said he is against his party's joining "the 
president's", "the government's" or any other party. He wants 
it to preserve its political and organizational independence. 
He categorically denied the possibility of cooperating with 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the State Duma "for political, medical, 
psychological and other reasons".

<F P=106> [By correspondent A. Pishchayev; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Pishchayev] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's subtleties knew 
no bounds today. At a meeting with electors in Moscow, he 
warned that presidential elections will be held before the end 
of parliament's two-year term in office, that is, this year. 
  The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] together, of 
course, with its leader will come to power. 
  How can they not win if, as Vladimir Volfovich says, the 
government has betrayed the interests not only of the Russians 
but of all Slavs. Who do you think are the most inveterate 
traitors? 
  [Video shows Zhirinovskiy addressing meeting] [Begin 
Zhirinovskiy recording] These are the scoundrels in the current 
Russian Government: Kozyrev, Chubays, and Shokhin. [end 
recording] 
  [Pishchayev] At the same time, he was rude about Russia's 
Choice, calling the faction Russia's Rejects. Regarding the 
government in the Kremlin, he remarked that it is pandering to 
the West which is testing on Serbia a method to destroy Russia. 
Once it has destroyed the Serbs, Zhirinovskiy said, world 
imperialism -- familiar vocabulary this -- wants to settle 
Muslims on their land and encircle Russia with an Islamic cordon. 
  The LDPR leader also demanded that the United Nations cancel 
its sanctions against Serbia. He compared Mitterrand to Hitler, 
since the French president has proposed, in his words, bomb 
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. 
  Also today, Zhirinovskiy advised the Russian president not 
to 
sign a friendship treaty with Georgia but offer it gubernare 
status within the Russian Federation.

  [Text] The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and its 
faction in the State Duma, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, predicts that 
presidential elections in Russia will take place before the 
two-year mandate of the present parliament expires, and that 
Russia's political leadership may be changed as early as this 
year. Addressing a meeting held in support of Serbia in Moscow 
on Saturday, Zhirinovskiy said that his party "may come to power 
for good in the current year". Held in Sokolnikiy, the meeting 
gathered about one thousand people. 
  Zhirinovskiy accused the Kremlin and the government of 
conniving with the West which "is testing mechanisms for 
destroying Russia" in Serbia. According to him, "the third 
world war waged against the Slavs and the Orthodox Church by the 
USA, West Germany and the Vatican" is already in progress in 
Yugoslavia. The West, Zhirinovskiy said, wants to surround 
Russia with "a green Muslim corridor" by destroying the people 
of Serbia and populating their land with Muslims, and leave it 
only one direction for development -- "from Moscow to Vologda 
and Arkhangelsk". Zhirinovskiy demanded that the economic 
sanctions imposed by the U.N. against Serbia be lifted, and 
compared the French President, Francois Mitterrand, who, he 
said, called for bombing the positions of Bosnian Serbs, with 
Hitler. 
  Zhirinovskiy condemned Russia's reorganized government for 
retaining Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Deputy Premier 
Anatoliy Chubays and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, and 
declared that they "betrayed not only the Russian people, but 
also all the Slavs". As for the resignation of Yegor Gaydar and 
Boris Fedorov, the LDP leader qualified it as an action 
"designed to deceive the populace", and described the Russian 
Choice faction as "fallout". 
  Had he been Russia's president, Zhirinovskiy said, he would 
not have signed a treaty on friendship, neighborliness and 
cooperation between Russia and Georgia, but suggested that 
Georgia should join Russia as one of its provinces, and cut all 
contacts with Tbilisi, if it refused. 
  The meeting was addressed by a spokesman for Serbia, who 
urged the Russian people to save their brethren in Serbia along 
with the Orthodox Church.

  [Text] The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party's 
faction in the State Duma Vladimir Zhirinovskiy sees no sense in 
the Russia's participation in the CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly. He has voiced this view in an interview with INTERFAX 
on the eve of a two-day session of that CIS body, opening in St. 
Petersburg on February 8. 
  "The Interparliamentary Assembly is an alien body, we have 
Russian parliament and do not need anything more", the leader of 
the second largest Duma faction remarked. "The assembly's 
founder Ruslan Khasbulatov is in the "Lefortovo" jail, that's 
where the whole assembly belongs, there are vacant cells there", 
he said. 
  Zhirinovskiy stressed that, the assembly and other CIS 
bodies 
consolidate "the dismemberment of Russia's territory". The LDP 
leader, as he has repeated over and over again, regards the 
entire territory of the former Russian Empire, Finland included, 
as genuinely Russian land. 
  In his opinion, Russia should stay out of pacts with the 
states that dropped out of the USSR. In his opinion, these 
countries should rejoin Russia as provinces, because such an 
ally for Russia would be, as he put it "a chimera beyond 
control." "No power can be stable without a single center", 
Zhirinovskiy claims. 
  When the Duma discussed on Friday whether to send a 
delegation to St. Petersburg or not, Zhirinovsky spoke out 
sharply against the Russian parliament's participation in the 
CIS body. The lawmaker Vyacheslav Marychev (St. Petersburg), 
suggested sending there those who "pounded Russian Parliament" 
in October 1993. "Let Lukin (Yavlinskiy's bloc -- IF) and 
Braginskiy (the "Russia's Choice bloc -- IF) go there, for 
Zyuganov and Rybkin there is nothing to do there", he declared. 
  During the crisis in Moscow last October, the Duma Speaker 
Ivan Rybkin and the leader of the Communist Party's faction 
Gennadiy Zyuganov were inside the White House together with the 
deputies of the Supreme Soviet, dissolved by Boris Yeltsin's 
decree. 
  Despite resistance from the Zhirinovskiy's faction, most 
lawmakers decided to send a delegation of five Duma members with 
Rybkin at the head to St. Petersburg. 
  A delegation of the Federal Assembly, the Upper House of the 
Federation Council, will be led by its Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  Both leaders figure in the list of candidates to the post of 
Chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly.

<F P=106> [Political scientist Viktor Bondarev article: "Reading TRUD </F>
Mailbag. Not So Much `For' As `Against'"] 
  [Text] Journalists, politicians, and scientists have been 
given various explanations for the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon." 
But what do the voters themselves think, how do they account 
for their choice, and what are they saying in their letters to 
the newspaper? 
  Many people believe that "voters voted not for Zhirinovskiy 
but against the ruling team's inability to cope with reforms" 
(V. Ogorodnikov, Kemerovo). A. Medyantsev from Yekaterinburg 
says effectively the same thing: "People only voted for 
Zhirinovskiy because he highlighted society's sore points to 
which our leaders are deaf." The question is that many people's 
living standard has been reduced to the lowest possible level 
and they have been made the dregs of society. It is a question 
of specific things like, for instance, losing savings as a 
result of "shock therapy." Here is one of the most emotional 
letters: "You made us all beggars. Had I been able to get my 
hands on Gaydar, I would have gone for the jugular," an elderly 
woman living in the north, who has lost both her savings and the 
chance of ever leaving there, writes. Another newspaper reader 
remembers the "Moskvich, for which I had saved for a long time 
and almost bought; but that hope has vanished like the mist." 
  People are equally indignant at the ineffectiveness of the 
fight against crime: "When the militia shrugs helplessly in 
response to calls for help and officials do not even deign to 
answer your complaint, there is no question of whom to vote 
for...." (L. Shlyapnikova, Perm). 
  Or: "Total license, bribe-taking, robbery, treachery, 
racketeering, pavement sex, a low birth rate, high mortality, 
rising unemployment, the bankruptcy of even profitable 
enterprises, the bankruptcy of our military-industrial complex, 
murders, assaults for virtually everyone to see, homeless people 
picking through garbage heaps -- Russian citizens are opposed to 
all this and protest where they can" (A. Kuznetsova, Irkutsk). 
Admittedly, the last letter indicates not so much that the 
person is unhappy but rather that they actively read newspapers. 
  It is hard to agree with Yekaterinburg resident A. 
Medyantsev's viewpoint in this connection -- he says that the 
government "is not aware of the sore points" in society. Not at 
all: Everyone is aware of these sore points, even the 
illiterates who merely enumerate our socioeconomic ills. The 
causes of and the means of escaping from the crisis most 
speedily are another matter. 
  As I read letters from people lusting for violence against 
the powers that be, I remembered the events of late last 
century: There was an epidemic in Russia, and the peasants 
murdered the doctors because they thought they were to blame for 
their misfortunes. The situation with our reforms is a similar 
one although, thank God, reformers are not yet being murdered.... 
  While agreeing (how can you disagree!) in many respects with 
TRUD readers and sharing their indignation and perplexity at the 
obvious distortions with the implementation of reforms, I would 
nonetheless also point out that we have surprisingly short 
memories. Two years ago we were in a crush waiting in line for 
vodka and sugar, we were moreover crushed in a very real sense 
when we tried to exchange ration cards for goods. The stores 
were completely empty. Mobs blocked streets and boulevards 
demanding cigarettes. There were shortages of bread, butter, 
and meat, while cheese no longer seemed to be produced in the 
country at all. There was not even any milk for young children. 
If there were rubles, there was nothing to do with them. 
  The economy went great guns [shla vraznos] between May 
1991, when Pavlov and Ryzhkov tried unsuccessfully to "regulate" 
prices, and this December: Barter and exchange in kind 
prevailed and oblasts posted militia cordons on their borders to 
ensure that foodstuffs did not "overflow" from one region to 
another. Why have we forgotten this? 
  If anyone brought the economy down, it was the people who 
directed it by Bolshevik distributive-administrative methods and 
the hapless reformers of the Gorbachev era. 
  Needless to say, Gaydar also had "a part to play." But, to 
be fair, he came along at a time when no one wanted to assume 
responsibility.... It is not for nothing that his policy is 
called "shock" policy. It was indeed an attempt at treatment 
using overly severe means. Did Yegor Gaydar and his "buddies" 
cure the economy? No. But at least a "fatal outcome" may have 
been averted for a while. 
  Admittedly, this was not only therapy, but by no means 
entirely well-considered surgery, resulting in a drastic drop in 
the production of many kinds of output and a host of enterprises 
ending up on the verge of bankruptcy. 
  People are saying that Gaydar is a monetarist, who follows 
the recommendation of his U.S. masters blindly, and his policy 
of "financial stabilization" could have actually destroyed the 
country. But here are Russia's budget figures for the fourth 
quarter of 1993: income -- 15 trillion rubles [R], expenditure 
-- R22 trillion. Thus the state spends R3 for every R2 it 
receives. But you cannot spend what you do not have. This is 
the result not only of Gaydar's miscalculations but also of 
pressure from his enemies and their demands that he spend as 
much as necessary for "social equilibrium." 
  Judging from the letters, Zhirinovskiy's promises to restore 
people's lost savings made a particular impression on many 
people. The authorities also say from time to time that they 
will repay their debts -- the latest presidential edict promises 
something of the kind. But something has obviously not been 
thought through here! In actual fact nothing can simply be 
accomplished in a fairly rapid timeframe. Before 1992 people 
had around R300 billion in savings, so should they today be 
given R300 trillion (since today's R1000 is roughly equivalent 
to the former ruble)? Russian produced output, so-called GDP, 
was worth around 100 trillion rubles for the whole of last year. 
  So, three times as much as the entire country produces in a 
year has to be repaid? Is that possible now? The answer is 
obvious. Nevertheless some action is needed. And here the 
government is to blame for not being inventive enough in finding 
at least a partial solution to the situation. For instance, all 
savings could be registered as a state debt, a state loan to be 
paid off over so many years. As for Zhirinovskiy's proposals 
regarding switching to repaying lost savings "in noncash form," 
I suggest that you take a look at any newspaper that carries 
advertisements. There are plenty of "encashment" offers there. 
That, is noncash money rapidly becomes cash ,and then what 
happens to prices? 
  By voting for Zhirinovskiy people were often protesting 
against the price that has to be paid for securing a market 
economy and true democracy. However, you can see something 
else. There are plenty of people who think Zhirinovskiy is the 
person who will (maybe) save the country. They were impressed 
by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's way of 
dealing with voters: "On television he spoke not to everyone at 
once, like certain turncoat Communists, but as it were to 
everyone individually" (anonymous letter). Another reader is 
convinced that "If Zhirinovskiy does not betray his election 
promises and implements a policy in the interests of Russian 
citizens and Russia, he will move mountains" (V. Bushuyev, 
Krasnodar Kray). 
  A number of other (more ironic, shall we say) people express 
partial solidarity with him: "The Zhirinovskiy option, the 
'stick and carrot' option suits us more in these conditions. 
And when he runs for president, you see, he will poll 90 
percent of the vote." (G. Kozharskiy, Rostov Oblast). Thus, 
some people do not merely reject "shock therapy" but also see 
the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon" as an alternative. A bad 
mistake!... 
  Incidentally, for some reason no one is paying attention to 
the name of the party led by Vladimir Volfovich -- the "Liberal 
Democratic Party." If readers are so unhappy with the 
democrats, why do they trust a "Liberal Democrat"? After all, 
who are these Liberal Democrats. They are people who presumably 
are in favor of using Western models for organizing society and 
the economy. In principle most democrats would most likely 
subscribe to this party's slogans and postulates (I will not 
venture to judge the program -- is there one?). But "Liberal 
Democracy" as practiced by Vladimir Volfovich is a strange 
thing: For some reason there are lots of Communists in his 
party. The businessman Zavidiya, the LDPR's former chief 
financier, is a Communist. Deputy Lukava, who as an elder 
opened the Duma session speaking on behalf of the LDPR faction, 
is a Communist. And some of this faction's other deputies are, 
as it were, members of two parties at once. Hasn't Vladimir 
Volfovich got confused with the name of his party...? 
  But if Zhirinovskiy is not a Liberal Democrat, what is he 
then? Let me cite a few quotations from a book: "Troubles for 
Russia have always come and will always come from the south... 
We must carry out this operation code-named the Last Dash 
to the South. Our Army will perform this task. This will 
be a method of ensuring the survival of the nation as a whole; 
it will be the basis for the renaissance of the Russian Army. 
New armed forces can be reborn only as a result of a combat 
operation. But the whole world must believe that, if Russia has 
to do this, it is fine. You have to proceed from the majority 
will. It is to the advantage of the majority of mankind for the 
Muslim world to be carved up [rassechen].... And across this 
new space to the shore of the Indian Ocean everybody will speak 
Russian...." These are extracts from Zhirinovskiy's book 
entitled Last Dash to the South. The author says that 
this is the "juice of my brain." 
  Some readers are indignant that the views of their elected 
representative are often described as profascist. "Since the 
elections people have been insulting not only the LDPR and the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation but also those who 
voted for them. We voters are called sheep, fascists, fools" 
(A. Khlebova in Volgograd). "You are frightening us once again 
with the advent of fascism in Russia. Perhaps we have had 
enough of being frightened. There is no need to pigeonhole Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy; we have already experienced that...," others say. 
  Yes, but if you agree with Zhirinovskiy's ideas and support 
the conquest of Afghanistan and Turkey, what kind of person are 
you...? Hitler called for eastward expansion, and Vladimir 
Volfovich is not averse to annexing the south. Admittedly, the 
people who voted for him stress that he is proposing to do all 
this by nonviolent means: "He is promising to revive Russia not 
by force but by other means, making it rich, and the process 
will happen on its own. Zhirinovskiy believes that we should 
drive to the Indian Ocean with the minimum use of force, since 
he believes that the countries involved will join us 
themselves." (L. Vedrov, Saratov). But how will this happen? 
Why would other peoples, those Afghans who fought the USSR for 
instance, suddenly join us voluntarily? Who can believe that? 
If we are right in our reading of Zhirinovskiy, who is coming 
up with these fantasies, it is hard to believe that sensible 
Russian people are willing to give power to that kind of man. 
But some are.... 
  ...In 1917 virtually the same percentage of Russian citizens 
voted for the Bolsheviks in the Constituent Assembly elections. 
The civil war with its millions of casualties began soon after. 
  But Russian citizens say in amazement: "Many democrats seem 
mere children on television" and "Why are you fussing, guys?" 
Others say: "The people have decided.... Should you be 
reproaching the people" (Yu. Vasnetsov, Yekaterinburg). 
Zhirinovskiy has promised to turn virtually the whole world 
into an area of combat operations, while the good-humored 
writers of other letters take political scientists and 
journalists to task: "Don't you dare insult the people's 
elected representative." If someone is extremely fond of 
Zhirinovskiy I suggest that they remember the film "Seventeen 
Moments of Spring." There are so many smart and in their own 
way extremely sympathetic national-socialists in it (Mueller and 
Schellenberg, for instance) who had no intention of doing a lot 
of fighting -- all they intended was a blitzkrieg, without 
balking at casualties, and then utter peace and prosperity for 
the German people. Admittedly things did turn out differently. 
  Most Russian citizens voted against Gaydar's scenario for 
reforms on 12 December. But what did they vote for? It is 
indeed necessary to realistically assess the serious 
miscalculations and to rectify the mistakes of the first phase 
of reform in Russia, but nonetheless not to recoil from but to 
stick to the market course (mindful of world experience and 
Russian conditions and traditions). And not to trust political 
magicians who promise "easy" routes to prosperity that may cause 
a great deal of bloodshed.

  [Text] Duma member Mikhail Poltoranin ("Russia's Choice 
faction) is convinced that the time to "create a presidential 
party has been lost." In his opinion, "people are unlikely to 
be persuaded to support even Boris Yeltsin," it should have done 
two years ago. As Poltoranin remarked in an interview with 
Interfax on Friday, "the last coach of this train has already 
gone." 
  Nonetheless, he urged setting up a formidable democratic 
party, which, as he believes, could comprise not only "Russia's 
Choice" but also Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's bloc, the Unity and 
Concord Party, and the "Democratic Russia" movement. 
  "We need to nominate for the next presidential elections a 
single candidate capable of rallying the people around him," 
Poltoranin stressed. However, he declined to name such a 
nominee and only said that "a few candidates are being 
considered." 
  He also voiced fear that during the debate over the 
president's amnesty decree the leftists would secure the legal 
release from Lefortovo prison of ex-Vice President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy and nominate him for the Russian presidency in 1996. 
  He recalled in this connection that the democrats did not 
have a stable majority in the Duma and for this reason 
participants in the October events in Moscow had a chance of 
getting on the list of persons subject to pardon. 
  Poltoranin thinks it's possible for Rutskoy to collect 
enough 
votes at elections as "Russia loves martyrs."

the proposed adjustment is to "do away with the hypertrophied 
multiparty practice." 
  According to Petr Filippov, head of the analytical center 
and 
member of the Presidential Council, the implementation of this 
project will inhibit the further existence of "dwarf" parties 
and will also affect the interests of "leaders with 
disproportionate ambitions who have now become State Duma 
deputies." 
  Mr. Filippov believes that in Russia there are no 
full-fledged political parties at present. "What we are used to 
calling a party is nothing but small groups of politically 
engaged citizens, united around one or several personalities. 
The president's main task, according to Petr Filippov, is to 
pass through the Federal Assembly draft laws which "would close 
one-man shows and drive political forces to concentrate within 
three or four large political parties." 
  The authors of an analytical memorandum sent to the 
president 
deem it expedient to reregister parties before elections to the 
State Duma. It is proposed to make registration of a political 
party contingent on its concrete action program in the event 
that it comes to power. A party may be admitted to elections 
only if its plans have evoked a certain public response. To 
this end a party will need to publish its program in the central 
press as a paid commercial announcement, as well as no less than 
10 articles discussing and commenting on it. 
  The document gives special attention to the problem of party 
financing, which, in the authors' opinion, cannot be done by 
legal entities. Analytical center experts propose to extend the 
right to contribute to party funds exclusively to private 
individuals. The latter, should the sum exceed a certain 
amount, will have to present their income return. 
  Parties that have complied with all the above requirements 
and entered the political arena will be entitled to state 
support. 
  At the same time the Legislative Initiatives Commission 
under 
the Russian Federation president has advised SEGODNYA's 
correspondent that the draft law on political parties does not 
exist yet and that all discussions about the supposed rights and 
obligations of political associations are being centered around 
its concept. At the end of January the commission held public 
hearings attended by representatives of 23 political parties. 
Various opinions were expressed while matters of registration 
and financing evoked particular interest. Work on the draft 
law, commission officials promised, will be continued, taking 
into account the wishes of participants in the hearings.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report in the "Communists" column: "The </F>
Russian Federation Communist Party Supports Abalkin's Program. 
The Constitution Will Be Abolished Later On"] 
  [Text] After the government has been reformed, the 
parliamentary majority has found itself in a difficult position: 
T he ambiguous assessments of the new Cabinet of Ministers have 
played havoc with the Communists' plans. The economic part of 
the program by the Russian Federation Communist Party and its 
allies was based on "anti-shock" declarations. Whereas the 
agrarians' tasks are obvious -- get as much money as possible -- 
the communists, fighting against President Yeltsin and "his 
constitution," have lost their main trump in this struggle -- 
propaganda against Russia's Choice. 
  Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov believes, however, 
that Russia's Choice members are still entrenched in the 
presidential and government apparatus. By way of illustration 
of their continued activity he cited the signing of a friendship 
treaty with Georgia and the abolition of benefits for workers in 
the country's northern regions. 
  Mr. Zyuganov is ready to be patient with the "sensible" part 
of the Cabinet of Ministers if he sees "a sound program for 
revising the reform course." The Russian Federation Communist 
Party is ready to approve in general "the initiative by 
Academicians Abalkin and Petrakov." The communists hope that 
their program will be a focus "around which all forces in the 
government and parliament, except Russia's Choice, will rally." 
  To accomplish their main objective -- "the removal of the 
ruling regime" -- the communists are still considering three 
options. The first is achieving victory in local elections. 
According to Mr. Zyuganov, regional administrations will try to 
write regulations on elections to suit themselves and the 
president will end up controlling the provinces. Here, the 
communist leader believes, the Duma must step in by adopting a 
local election law. 
  The second option -- disavowal of the constitution -- 
according to Zyuganov, is too early to discuss. "One must not 
stir up a storm all at once," he said. The constitution, in his 
opinion, will be "rejected by life itself." 
  The third option relates precisely to how such life should 
be 
organized. The "extreme measure" -- a Russian-wide strike -- 
the communists claim, "will wipe out the regime but also finally 
kill the economy."

  [Text] "A disgraceful page has been written into the 
history of the oldest paper in the country," said the editor of 
PRAVDA, Viktor Linnik. 
  He told a news conference in Moscow on Friday that the same 
day part of the newspaper's staff had decided to continue 
cooperation with the Greek company Stilight Holdings Ltd., fire 
Linnik and replace him with acting editor Aleksandr Ilyin. 
  Linnik said the majority of the staff did not recognize the 
decision, since most of those present at the meeting where it 
was taken were members of the Greek company. 
  He said only 76 people of PRAVDA's staff of 233 had attended 
the meeting. "One may say a split has occurred within our 
staff," he said. 
  Linnik said Stilight Holdings insisted that all rights to 
the 
newspaper be handed over to PRAVDA International, where the 
Greek company holds the controlling interest, 55 percent of 
shares. But the editorial board and most of the staff of PRAVDA 
wished the controlling interest in the paper to be owned by a 
Russian corporation, he said. 
  Linnik said PRAVDA had already started talks to that end 
with 
one of the financial groups. As the first step, the PRAVDA 
staff, late in December, decided to make the paper a 
public-stock company called the PRAVDA Concern. 
  He said Stilight Holdings had been dissatisfied with it, 
appealing to court against the decision of the PRAVDA staff to 
reregister the paper and organizing Friday's staff meeting.

<F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy report: "Court of Appeal for </F>
Information Disputes -- Censorship or Promoting Free Speech?"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin has ratified the Statute on the 
Russian Federation President's Court of Appeal [sudebnaya 
palata] for Information Disputes. It is likely to meet with a 
mixed reaction from journalists. 
  The Court of Appeal set up by the president is the successor 
to the Information Court of Arbitration that operated during the 
election campaign. Five of the seven members of the new 
collegium worked on the Court of Arbitration under the 
leadership of Doctor of Juridical Sciences Anatoliy Vengerov, 
who has now been appointed chairman of the Court of Appeal for 
Information Disputes. 
  The court should help the president to carry out his 
constitutional role as guarantor of citizens' rights and 
freedoms -- specifically in the sphere of information and the 
mass media. It will not examine disputes within the jurisdiction 
of the general civil courts -- in particular, defamation cases. 
  In accordance with the Statute on the Court of Appeal it 
must 
promote the "safeguarding of rights and freedoms in the sphere 
of the mass media; objectivity and accuracy of reports 
concerning the public interest; the protection of the moral 
interests of children and young people in the media; and the 
observance of the principle of political pluralism in news and 
sociopolitical television and radio programs." The Court of 
Appeal will resolve disputes on the allocation of airtime to 
parliamentary factions. 
  The statute gives the Court of Appeal the right to "order 
the 
rectification of factual errors in media news reports concerning 
the public interest," to make representations regarding the 
submission of written warnings to media sponsors and editorial 
offices and, following such warnings, to make representations 
for the activities of the media to be judicially wound up. The 
court has the right to reprimand journalists and to raise the 
question of instituting proceedings against them if they have 
violated "generally accepted ethical norms." 
  This level of jurisdiction and the range of powers available 
to the Court of Appeal for Information Disputes makes it very 
similar to an organ of censorship -- albeit one after the event 
rather than before the event. Admittedly, such censorship would 
be useful, for instance, in the sphere of protecting public 
morality from chauvinist propaganda, violence, or pornography, 
but the court's direct dependence on the President's 
Administration also creates the threat that its censorship 
powers might be used for political purposes -- particularly in 
light of the vague criteria for "generally accepted ethical 
norms." 
  In personal conversation Anatoliy Vengerov categorically 
dissociated himself from the claims that he is a censor, 
pointing out that, on the contrary, the Court of Appeal intends 
primarily to campaign for the extension of journalists' rights 
and their unswerving observance by officials, and to fight 
infringements of the media's freedom and, in particular, the way 
in which journalists' right to obtain socially important 
information is ignored. The Court of Appeal chairman advocated 
close cooperation between this state organ and journalists. 
  From the journalists' standpoint, the fact that the Court of 
Appeal for Information Disputes is being set up is as yet hard 
to assess unambiguously. Some of the organ's functions could 
undoubtedly serve to promote genuine free speech. At the same 
time, under certain circumstances the Court of Appeal could also 
pursue a policy of actually restricting free speech and 
interfering in matters which would be better left to journalists 
themselves within the framework of the Law on the Press or a 
general civil process without the importunate help of special 
state organs. Incidentally, we as yet have no cause to rebuke 
the Court of Appeal for anything of the kind, and journalists 
are initially inclined to cooperate with it rather than to be in 
confrontation with it.

"`Mirzayanov Case' To Be Dismissed"] 
  [Text] The trial of chemist Vil Mirzayanov will likely be 
dismissed in the coming days. According to some information, 
Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's national security 
adviser, has reported in detail to Boris Yeltsin the 
circumstances of the criminal case against the scientist who had 
allegedly revealed a state secret about the development in 
Russia of new types of chemical weapons, and the president 
"adequately reacted to the prosecution's being 
unconstitutional." Yuriy Baturin explained that a criminal case 
under Article 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code may be dismissed 
in connection with changed circumstances. He regards as such 
"changed circumstances" the adoption of the new Russian 
Federation Constitution under which "everyone has the right to 
freely look for, receive, pass on, produce, and distribute 
information by any legal means. The list of information 
constituting a state secret is determined by a federal law." 
Since no open list of information about state secrets has been 
published, this circumstance may be cause for dismissing the 
case against the scientist, something Russian human rights 
activists and the liberal press insist on.

  [Text] Moscow, 4 Feb--Chemist Vil Mirzayanov, who is 
accused of divulging state secrets, began to testify in court 
today, Mirzayanov's lawyer Aleksandre Asnis told journalists 
during a break in the court session. He informed journalists 
and lawyers that the court had dismissed his client's appeal for 
a mistrial and for the trial to be make public. In the lawyer's 
words, the court questioned witness Nikishin, after which the 
defendant "considered it possible for him to answer questions 
from participants in the trial". 
  At the same time, ITAR-TASS has learned from sources close 
to 
the Russian president that Boris Yeltsin tends to believe that 
the trial of the scientist is unconstitutional, and he may soon 
use his influence as guarantor of the Constitution to stop the 
Mirzayanov trial.

  [Text] Russian scientist Vil Mirzayanov, charged with 
divulging a national secret, does not wish to appeal for release 
from custody, his counsel for the defense said. 
  The counsel, Aleksandr Asnis, told Interfax on Friday the 
scientist had even refused to discuss the matter with him. 
  Asnis said the Moscow City Court had continued questioning 
Mirzayanov on Friday afternoon. The scientist "agreed to give 
evidence because he still hoped to make it clear to the judges 
why he does not consider himself to be guilty," Asnis said. 
  He said he hoped the interrogation of Mirzayanov and 
witnesses would persuade the counsel for the prosecution, Leonid 
Pankratov, to ask for an additional investigation of the case. 
  Mirzayanov's interrogation will be continued at the next 
court session at 10:30 on February 7. 
  The prosecution against Mirzayanov was started in 1992, 
after 
the newspaper Moscow News carried his story "Poisoned Policy," 
which said Russia was creating binary weapons.

  [Text] The former senior analyst of one of the secret 
research institutes, Vladimir Uglyov, told a press conference in 
Moscow today that he will not inform Russian and foreign 
journalists of new chemical weapons developed in Russia. Uglyov 
had announced his attention to reveal this information in his 
address to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on January 22, if the 
latter failed to discuss with him issues related to the 
destruction of chemical weapons. 
  The chemist explained his decision by the fact that he saw 
hope that the authorities could hear his voice after his recent 
meeting with the presidential advisor for national security, 
Yuriy Baturin. In addition, Uglyov said he feared that revealing 
the formula and other specific features of the new chemical 
weapons could enable some countries to launch its uncontrolled 
production. 
  Uglyov also said he held hope for a favorable end of 
"Mirzayanov's fanned case." He said the scientist's intention 
to reveal the formula was the reason for launching legal 
proceedings against him. 
  The press conference was also attended by another former 
chemist, now disabled Vladimir Petrenko, who became victim of 
chemical weapons tests conducted in the institute over a decade 
ago.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov for </F>
TASS] 
  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- "The state must pay its 
debts," Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of Russia's Central Bank, 
said on Friday, addressing the lower house of the Russian 
parliament on an item entitled "an hour of the government." 
  Gerashchenko declared that the outstanding debts of the 
state 
to some sectors of the economy, and farmers, in particular, 
would be paid, although not simultaneously. Gerashchenko said 
that the total debt amounts to almost eight trillions roubles. 
Chairman of Russia's Central Bank pointed out that the question 
of outstanding debts was discussed at a session of the Russian 
Government on Thursday, adding that the matter would be 
finalized during next week and afterwards, positively resolved. 
  Russian lawmakers found it a paradox to hear Gerashchenko 
say 
that currently, the system of mutual payments has been working 
better than before, including with former Soviet republics. 
Gerashchenko pointed out that there is an active balance of 
payments between Russia and CIS countries. "We are pursuing a 
policy of restricting credits issued to CIS countries from the 
state budget," Gerashchenko said. 
  Asked where Russia will find money to grant a credit to 
Georgia, Gerashchenko replied that "our leaders can prove to the 
State Duma that such a credit is necessary." 
  Commenting on the current financial situation in Russia, 
Gerashchenko said that "we have been going up the spiral of 
inflation all the time." He admitted that the Central Bank 
spent over a million dollars in January alone to stabilise the 
rouble exchange rate. 
  Gerashchenko pointed out that according to estimates made by 
the Central Bank, last year, the budget deficit was within 10.5 
per cent of the gross national product. But in his opinion, "no 
tragedy has occurred." 
  Gerashchenko declared that currently, "we have been 
constantly experimenting which might trigger inflation to a 
certain degree and perhaps, we shall not attain the reduction of 
the budget deficit by 5 per cent of the size of the gross 
national product as we would like to do."

"Agrarians Will Receive Money. Lower Chamber Expects Dubinin 
and Gerashchenko Today"] 
  [Excerpts] Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and 
Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko have been invited to 
address the State Duma today. This was confirmed yesterday by 
deputies from the Agrarian Party, who held a press conference 
"On the performance of the agro-industrial sector in 1994." 
[passage omitted] 
  As the press conference was under way, the government's 
presidium was holding a meeting at the White House to consider a 
decree of the same name. Gennadiy Kulik, deputy chairman of the 
State Duma's budget committee and former agricultural minister 
of the USSR and the RSFSR, who had just returned from the White 
House, told his colleagues and the press some details about the 
meeting. 
  Two drafts -- from the Agricultural Ministry and the Economy 
Ministry -- were submitted to the government for consideration. 
According to Mr. Kulik, although there are significant 
differences between the drafts, it was nonetheless decided to 
merge them into one document to be agreed upon. Mr. Kulik said 
that the Agricultural Ministry's draft required the state to buy 
100 percent of grain, oil-bearing crops, sugar beets, meat, 
milk, and wool to be produced in 1994. The government agreed in 
principle, but an argument broke out about the expected amounts 
of the produce. 
  Viktor Gerashchenko did not agree, however, with the 
suggestion that the repayment of government debts to the 
agro-industrial sector should be dragged out as long as 
possible, and said that they would be repaid in the first 
quarter of this year, Mr. Kulik said. Agricultural enterprises 
will get a total of 1.3 trillion rubles; although they insisted 
that the sum be indexed, however, they did not manage to push 
the idea through. Nor did they receive the desired credits to 
the tune of 8.5 trillion rubles in the first six months 
(including 4.2 trillion to pay for fuel) to ensure the spring 
fieldwork and to carry the livestock through the winter period. 
The agro-industrial sector will get only 1.2 trillion in 
credits in the first quarter. 
  So, Viktor Chernomyrdin has so far fallen short of 
satisfying 
agricultural appetites in full, although the "agrarians" trust 
him and think that "the castlings in the government have made it 
possible to forgo the question of no-confidence in it." This 
was also stated at yesterday's press conference.

<F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva report: "The Government Has Approved a </F>
Lobbying Allowance. The Agro-Industrial Complex Will Cost 
Russia 10 Times the Food Import"] 
  [Text] In yesterday's session the Council of Ministers 
Presidium approved the Russian Federation Government resolution 
"On the Functioning of the Russian Federation Agro-industrial 
Complex in 1994" and issued orders for it to be finalized within 
10 days. The draft was prepared by Zaveryukha's department with 
the participation of representatives from the Foreign Economic 
Relations Ministry, the Russian State Fishing Committee, the 
Central Bank, the Fuel and Energy Ministry, and was then 
approved by the Economy Ministry practically without comment. 
The sole department that strongly criticized this "lobby 
allowance" was the Finance Ministry. This must be why two days 
before the session Zaveryukha sent a letter to the presidium 
accusing the Finance Ministry of sabotaging the program for 
revitalizing the agricultural sector, and yesterday he stated: 
"Russia must feed its peasants." 
  In addition to the measures of state support for the 
agro-industrial complex (an investment credit of 1.3 trillion 
rubles and 2.8 trillion rubles of centralized capital inputs for 
the first quarter of 1994), it was proposed to preserve 
subsidies for centralized food imports and establish subsidy 
coefficients for imported technological equipment. Furthermore 
it is envisioned to compensate 30 percent of expenditures for 
fertilizer purchases and to impose restrictive custom duties on 
the import of "white sugar, wool, flax and hemp fibers, and 
industrially harvested fur and pelt materials." 
  According to Economy Ministry estimates, 24 additional 
measures to support the agricultural sector will call for an 
additional 14 trillion rubles of budget funds. The aggregate 
cost of the program for the state budget, however, will amount 
to 34 trillion rubles ($22 billion at the current exchange rate) 
which exceeds the volume of agricultural imports 10 fold. "It 
must be remembered that in Russian agriculture, the sowing 
season is immediately followed by harvesting," Sergey Vasilyev, 
head of the Working Center for Economic Reforms, which has not 
yet been dissolved, said at a press conference yesterday.

  [Text] The Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs urged the government to take resolute steps to 
prevent "an imminent catastrophe" caused by the further 
aggravation of the economic crisis. Many plants and factories 
in the country have stopped working, and in the next few weeks 
this process may acquire the nature of an avalanche, the union 
declared in a statement published on Monday. 
  Under the circumstances, the union considers it necessary to 
take a range of urgent measures designed to overcome the crisis, 
such as work out a mechanism for regulating prices and incomes. 
According to the authors of the statement, the prices of many 
goods, above all food products, are already above the world 
level. 
  In addition, the union calls for taking steps aimed at 
decreasing the volume of free funds handled by commercial banks, 
and at limiting the activity of commercial structures at 
currency exchanges. Its statement says it is necessary to 
announce increases in the cost of basic types of fuel two or 
three months in advance in order to prevent continuing 
uncontrolled price hikes on essential types of raw materials. 
  According to the statement, the clamor about "the only 
slightly reshuffled government" poses an attempt by some 
political forces "to lay the blame for economic blunders on the 
president and prime minister." "The record fall in production -- 
by over 25% in the first month of the current year, and 
the 
runaway price hikes -- in January prices rose by 20%, are 
a 
consequence of the shock therapy policy adopted by the 
monetarist reformers in January of 1992," the statement says.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The market reforms of the 
past two years have not yielded the expected results. This was 
not due to some individual mistakes, but due to the incorrectly 
chosen course of switching over to a market economy by "shock" 
and monetaristic methods. This conclusion is contained in a 
report, drawn up by the Economics Department of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences and the international "Reform" fund. The 
report analyses the current situation in the Russian economy and 
outlines new approaches to reforms. 
  Continuation of the chosen course, the authors of the 
document claim, will produce "disastrous consequences" and drive 
the country into an impasse. The Russian economy is in a 
critical state already today. The production slump has reached 
40 per cent, and the total volume of investments has dropped by 
150 per cent. Moreover, the production slump is of a universal 
character and has affected the most technologically advanced 
sectors of economy. Most alarming is the fact that depreciation 
of fixed production assets has reached 60 per cent, which is the 
limit, after which the country's production potential is bound 
to collapse. "In view of the fact that the key role in the 
ongoing inflationary processes is played by the inflation of 
outlays," the authors of the report claim, "it is impossible to 
combat it by purely monetaristic methods, because restrictions 
on the amount of money in circulation and reduction of the 
budget deficit will obstruct rational structural changes and 
aggravate the production slump." 
  Proceeding from the results of a complex analysis of 
practically all the spheres of the national economy, the authors 
of the report have drawn the conclusion that it is not only 
necessary to correct the course, but to work out new approaches 
to the strategy and tactics of the socio-economic reforms in 
Russia. In their opinion, stabilisation measures, like the ones 
used by many countries in such situations, are most expedient in 
this case, too. This must include some short-term measure to 
effect state control over prices for raw materials and railway 
carriages. The state must also pay its debt to individual 
sectors of the national economy and to other spheres of economy. 
The correlation of prices and the level of wages must then be 
normalised by means of a conciliatory process. 
  According to figures furnished by the Economic forecasting 
Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and used in the 
report, the general rate of inflation could be lowered by 8-10 
per cent a month as a result of such measures. Prices could be 
"adjusted" to fixed correlations in most sectors within two or 
three months. Parallel with this, it appears expedient to 
introduce progressive taxes for excessively high profitability, 
to toughen sanctions for tax evasion, to reassess the fixed 
assets and to grant tax exemptions to the part of the profits 
used for accumulating fixed assets. As a result of all these 
measures the level of inflation may be lowered to 3-5 per cent a 
month within a period of four or five months. The proposed 
solution, the authors of the report believe, is one of the 
possible ways to resolve the problem which, if ignored, may lead 
to serious economic consequences.

  [Text] Moscow, 4 Jan--"A Russian Army capable of carrying 
out all of the tasks allotted to it should number 2-2.1 
million," the Russian defense minister stated at a meeting in 
Georgia with officers from the 405th Motorized Infantry Regiment 
stationed in Vaziani. In his opinion, numbers for the Armed 
Forces as set out in the defense law--1.5 million by 1995--are 
insufficient to carry out the tasks of guaranteeing the state's 
security. 
  Pavel Grachev confirmed the military department's policy of 
recruitment on contract. Contract soldiers, the minister said, 
will be recruited mainly for the fighting units and not for the 
administrative or quartermasters' services. In 1993, 93,000 
contract soldiers were recruited in 1993. The plan is to 
recruit 150,000-160,000 contract soldiers in 1994. 
  The defense minister also spoke of the proposed 
reorganization of educational work in the Army. Its focus will 
move from the center to the level of companies, battalions, and 
regiments. There are specific proposals for regiments to have a 
deputy commander responsible for educational work, a lawyer, 
psychologist, and a sociologist.

  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS--A captain in the Russian 
Army is one of two men, detained by detectives from the 
Khabarovsk Territorial Internal Affairs Department on the 
suspicion that they stole 75 guns. Several of the weapons were 
discovered with the suspects, while the rest have yet to be 
found, according to the Public Communications Center of the 
Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  Specialists in the Interior Ministry still consider Army 
units a stable "source of supply" of weapons to criminal 
elements. Military personnel fairly often make off with guns 
and ammunition in order to earn some extra money. In 1993, 6430 
weapons were illegally "transferred" into criminal hands, twice 
as much as the corresponding 1992 figure. Every third stolen 
weapon is from the Army. 
  Deputy Chief of the law and order department's investigative 
section Leonid Turchin says he is "astonished" by the fact that 
unit and regiment commanders cannot ensure the safekeeping of 
weapons and explosives, even when they are locked up in depots, 
located in military bases and surrounded by high fences and 
barbed wire.

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev received Russian Ambassador 
to Azerbaijan Valter Shonia today. 
  Geydar Aliyev noted that this meeting was important because 
it emphasized the need to resolve problems stemming from 
existing conditions that concern both countries. 
  The Azerbaijani president expressed his satisfaction at the 
recently improving relations between Azerbaijan and Russia. He 
noted that such relations are in the interest of both countries. 
  Geydar Aliyev drew the Russian ambassador's attention to the 
undeniable fact that representatives of various nationalities 
are fighting in the ranks of Armenia's occupationist army. This 
shows that the soldiers and officers from the 127th Army based 
in Armenia are participating in the aggression against 
Azerbaijan in the ranks of the occupationist troops. 
  The Azerbaijani president reiterated that despite the 
extremely tense situation, our Republic favors the peaceful 
resolution of the problem. Whereas, Armenia not only always 
undermines peace efforts and fails to abide by the previous 
agreements, it broadens the scope of the aggression. 
  The Azerbaijani president then referred to the National 
Assembly debate on the 20 January 1990 tragedy and said that the 
position of some opposition deputies, who blame the Russian Army 
and the Russians for this tragedy, can be justified. Those 
events were the result of the objectives being pursued by the 
former imperialism and communist regime. The Azerbaijani 
leadership at that time was guilty in this incident. Those who 
put the blame on outsiders want to absolve themselves from their 
own responsibility in the tragedy. 
  In his turn, the Russian ambassador expressed his views on 
matters of mutual interest.

are continuing attempts at breaking the Karabakh defenses. 
  According to the press service, Azeri troops resumed their 
attacks east and southeast of the Karabakh town of Martuni in 
the morning of February 4. As on preceding days, Karabakh units 
repelled them. 
  Azeri aircraft are reported to fly several reconnaissance 
mission over northern areas of Nagorno-Karabakh Friday morning. 
  A source in the Azeri Defense Ministry confirmed that the 
fighting had become largely positional but said that Armenian 
forces mounted attacks in the north of the warzone that had been 
preceded by heavy artillery barrages of villages in the Ter-Ter 
and Geranboi districts of Azerbaijan. Two civilians were killed 
and nearly ten injured. According to Baku reports, Armenians 
also attacked in the direction of the settlement of Goradiz on 
the Azeri-Armenian border.

losses in two days of fighting are estimated at 40 men, 2 tanks, 
and 1 armored vehicle. 
  On the southern front (down the Goradiz line), according to 
the spokesman, there have been sporadic battles. Azerbaijani 
army positions and villages were repeatedly shelled throughout 
Friday. Casualties are being specified.

  [Excerpt] A NATO mission is currently on a tour presenting 
in more detail the opportunities available through and the aims 
of the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. The mission wants 
to present a clear picture of how prepared different countries 
are to take part in the program. Today, the NATO mission is in 
Estonia. Urmas Loit reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Loit] Joining the Partnership for Peace 
program is Estonia's first step towards becoming a full member 
of NATO. This was said at a news conference today, given by the 
NATO mission, which is presenting to Estonia the principles and 
opportunities of the partnership program. NATO representatives 
had a meeting with Defense Minister Indrek Kannik; Defense 
Forces Commander Aleksandr Einseln; Peeter Lorents, Riigikogu's 
state defense commission's deputy chairman; and Foreign Ministry 
Chancellor Alar Olljum. Defense Minister Indrek Kannik will sum 
up what was said. 
  [Kannik] During the meetings today, the Estonian side has 
been speaking about the aspects we ourselves consider most 
important in the PFP program. Talking about the political 
aspects, one must emphasize a consultations mechanism included 
in the PFP program. We consider the possibility of holding 
political consultations with NATO -- in a situation of a serious 
crisis -- extremely necessary in our view, and we see it as an 
essential mechanism. 
  The Estonian side has been talking at today's meetings also 
about the need for military cooperation. It is precisely joint 
exercises we have in mind here. Of course, in this context the 
question will arise immediately as to how Estonia can pay for 
her expenses. As is known, the PFP program states very clearly 
that both parties, NATO as well as a NATO partner, must pay for 
their own expenses. But I believe that here, too, solutions are 
possible. For example, even in the course of the discussions 
today our colleagues, our friends from NATO suggested that some 
exercises may take place on Estonian territory that would 
substantially reduce our expenses. We also consider the 
opportunity to have Estonian officers trained very important for 
us within the PFP program. 
  [Loit] A Defense Ministry, the defense forces headquarters, 
and the Foreign Ministry working group will be drawing up the 
Estonian view of concrete cooperation within the next couple of 
months. Evidently as early as the second half of February 
another NATO mission will arrive to advise our politicians. [end

  [Text] Tallinn, February 4 -- Estonian Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Juri Luik, after signing the Partnership for Peace 
Programme in Brussels, on Thursday [3 February], arrived at a 
one-day official visit to Finland, on Friday. 
  Luik met Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, with whom he 
discussed Estonian-Finnish economic relations and Finnish 
President Mauno Koivisto. Luik had a longer meeting with his 
Finnish counterpart Heikki Haavisto. Under discussion were 
bilateral and international relations, agreements, juridical and 
economic issues. Minister Luik also explained the background of 
joining the Partnership for Peace programme. 
  Luik gave a press conference in Helsinki, on Friday, where 
he 
said that besides signing the Partnership for Peace programme he 
also met Foreign Relations Commissioner of the European Union 
Hans van der Broek in Brussels, with whom he reached an 
agreement that concluding free trade agreement between Estonia 
and European Union should be on the agenda this summer. 
  Commenting on the Partnership for Peace Programme Luik said 
that the direct importance of the agreement lied in the fact 
that "NATO was not indifferent towards Estonia". Estonia needs 
help in development of defence forces, juridical questions and 
formation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and in these 
areas NATO is ready to support Estonia, he added. 
  Luik said that Estonia will apply for full membership of 
NATO 
when "time was rife" for it. The three Baltic states will 
cooperate on the issue, and will apply for the membership 
together, Luik said. 
  Luik arrived back to Estonia Friday evening.

  [Interview with Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik by an 
unidentified correspondent in Brussels on 3 February--recorded; 
monitored in progress] 
  [Excerpts] [Luik] [passage omitted] Yesterday [2 February], 
I 
also had a meeting with Mr. [Hans] Van der Broek, the European 
Union's foreign affairs commissioner. This was also an 
exceptionally successful meeting. We discussed mainly Estonia 
joining the European Union via an association agreement. 
  [Correspondent] A document has now been signed, but what 
steps are now expected from us? What do we need to do to be 
suitable partners to NATO, so to speak? 
  [Luik] A suitable partner must present a document about our 
major needs for the building of the defense forces in Estonia. 
Work on drafting this document has already begun in Tallinn. A 
corresponding NATO team is in Tallinn today to provide us with 
preliminary advice on composing such a document. Then we will 
put this document together--our Foreign and Defense Ministries. 
We will definitely also involve members of parliament and 
experts. The document must fairly precisely list the needs 
existing for the Estonian defense forces at the moment. NATO 
will then select the aspects where it can provide support. 
  [Correspondent] Did this unfortunate fact also come up in 
your discussions--that the Estonian-Russian round of talks, from 
which quite a lot was in fact expected--ended, in essence, with 
a fat zero? A timetable for the troop withdrawal was not 
presented. 
  [Luik] Yes, this came up at the European Union, as well as 
at 
NATO. I also spoke about this to journalists at a news 
conference. This is, of course, extremely unfortunate, and 
everybody I met expressed amazement that the Russian side had 
failed to produce the relevant documents. At the moment, it 
seems that the Russian side is violating one of its basic 
promises, not to link the troop withdrawal to any other issues. 
A clearly evident link has been made between the troop 
withdrawal and the fate of military pensioners. This is a link 
we cannot accept, and this is what I have also said here in 
Brussels.

  [Text] Before today most talk about the Estonian-Russian 
talks focused on the fact that the Russian side failed to 
present a timetable for its troop withdrawal. Some other 
aspects have come to light today, however. In fact, in the 
course of the 16th round of the Estonian-Russian talks an 
agreement on the troop withdrawal from Estonia was almost 
completely agreed upon. For the first time Estonia agreed 
officially to the Russian proposal for the troops to be 
withdrawn by 31 August of this year. This has been stated by 
Juri Kahn, Estonian ambassador to Russia. According to Kahn the 
only point in the agreement that remains unresolved is the issue 
of financial compensation. This will have to be regulated at 
the level of heads of state. The Russian side has, however, 
(?stipulated) that they would agree to holding a summit only 
once the Estonian side has ensured social protection for the 
Russian military pensioners in Estonia, according to the 
conditions set by Russia. 
  Considerable progress at this round of Estonian-Russian 
talks 
was achieved also concerning issues on dismantling the nuclear 
reactors at Paldiski. According to ETA this was stated by Mark 
Sinisoo, leader of the Estonian delegation's working group on 
Paldiski and an adviser at the Foreign Ministry, at a news 
conference today. According to him success achieved at the talks 
in Moscow resulted directly from the conclusions made at the 
conference held last week in Stockholm on the issue of Paldiski.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 04, BNS -- More than ten thousand 
retired Russian military who live in Estonia constitute a threat 
to the country's security, a member of the Estonian delegation 
for talks with Russia said in a press conference. 
  Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation, said data 
provided by Russia shows the number of former Russian Military 
in Estonia at 10,570. A total 850 of them have been discharged 
and are part of Russia's military reserve. The rest are retired 
personnel. The Russian Military born before 1930, numbering 
4,345 in Estonia, are eligible to apply for a permanent 
residence permit. The rest of the former military are younger 
than 63. 
  "I contest the claims that a reserve officer of 50-60 years 
of age doesn't constitute any threat to Estonia," Tiiman said. 
  He said Russia with the topic of retired military was 
attempting to create an artificial obstacle on the way of 
negotiations. 
  The Russian side at the last round of negotiations, which 
ended Wednesday [2 February], refused to turn over to Estonia a 
timetabe for the withdrawal of troops, accusing Estonia of 
unwillingness to sign a social guarantees agreement for the 
former Russian Military living in the country. 
  Tiiman said Russia was unable to understand Estonia's 
worries 
about the topic of the retired military. 
  "When I told Russian generals that also Estonia was having 
its national interests, they opened their eyes wide and asked 
what sort of a thing was that," Tiiman added. 
  He said Russia's conditions concerning the social welfare 
guarantees to retired military included a demand to make changes 
in the Estonian legislation. At the same time Russia doesn't 
agree to a scheme of determining the size of pensions for the 
military by indexation. 
  Tiiman said the Russian Army pensioners in Estonia were 
getting big pensions, as Russia still continues payment of the 
money under the 1992 exchange rate of 10 roubles to the Estonian 
kroon. The current rate is more than 110 roubles to the kroon. 
  If Russia starts payment under the current exchange rate, 
the 
size of pensions would drop below the subsistence minimum in 
Estonia and the Baltic country would have to pay an additional 
allowance to the former Russian Military.

  [Text] Latvia's Foreign Affairs Minister Georg Andreyev 
said that the Latvian delegation to the talks with Russia should 
agree to the plan which will probably be proposed by the Russian 
side in the course of the next round. 
  Russia's intention to seek compromise, which came as a 
result 
of a meeting in Moscow between Russian Government 
representatives, U.S. President Bill Clinton, and the Latvian 
delegation led by Andreyev, was announced in Washington by U.S. 
Administration officials. Under the new plan, the radar station 
in Skrunda will operate for another four years and will then be 
dismantled within 18 months. 
  At present, however, Russia's position adopted during the 
previous round is still valid at the current Latvian-Russian 
intergovernment negotiations, whereby the operation of the 
Skrunda radar will be extended for five years. Officially 
Russia has not as yet advised Latvia about a change of position. 
  According to Andreyev, it is still not clear how this issue 
will be decided. The Latvian delegation's mandate may be 
changed only after this issue has been studied by the 
leadership, for example, the Saeima's Interfactional Council. 
The minister said that to prevent an indefinite delay in its 
resolution, this question should not be discussed at a plenary 
Saeima session.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 04, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima (parliament) 
adopted the 1994 state budget act late Thursday [3 February] 
night and the president announced its enactment beginning with 
Jan. 1, 1994. 
  The state will spend 593,411,853 lats in 1994, while the 
projected incomes are 556,704,800 lats. Lawmakers also approved 
a 40-million-lat budget deficit. 
  The parliament plans to cover the deficit from direct 
borrowings, foreign credits and internal loans. 
  The maximal admissible amount of total state debts was fixed 
at 331,254,000 lats. From this, the internal debt may reach 
79,984,000 lats and the outer debt may reach 251,270,000 lats. 
  The government may guarantee 20,730,000 million lats in 
1994. 
  The state treasury turnover funding was calculated at 5 
million lats. 
  The parliament assigned additional funding for the defense, 
health care, culture, science and television. 
  The legislator decided against increasing funding for 
families with children. This issue will be considered during 
the fiscal year. Environmental education programs, Agriculture 
Ministry's kindergartens and state radio were also denied a 
funding increase. 
  The local budgets' levelling fund will consist of 90,213,861 
lats. From this, 58,232,361 are state subsidies and 31,981,500 
will be channelled to the fund for levelling of residents' 
incomes 
  Lawmakers cut the reserve for the implementation of the 
civil 
service reform from 5 million lats to 4 million lats. 
  The budget also provides to increase the payment of taxes 
into the Venstpils city budget from 20 percent to 40 percent. 
Consequently, 60 percent of taxes will flow into the local 
budgets levelling fund. 
  All amendments to the basic budget plan will be discussed 
late in March.

  [Text] On Thursday [3 February] Lithuanian officials took 
over the files of KGB old-age pensioners residing in Lithuania. 
Earlier, the files, kept in the former KGB headquarters in 
Vilnius, were under the charge of a special KGB people group, 
subordinate to the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. The Baltic News 
Service reports that a conflict broke out while taking over the 
documents, as the women in charge of the dossiers refused to 
give them to Lithuanian officials. The authorized Russian 
official was not present during the handover of the documents, 
and the Russian Embassy in Vilnius refused to comment on the 
incident. The files of the KGB pensioners will now be kept in 
the Lithuanian archives and will be accessible to both 
Lithuanian and Russian officials.

  [Text] Moscow Feb 4 -- Russia and the United States will 
conduct joint military exercises in the Far East in July to 
train troops for operations conducted by peacekeeping forces. 
The exercises are expected to be held for a week on Russian 
territory, with the participation of a few units belonging to 
land troops, ITAR-TASS learned from a well-informed source in 
the Russian Defense Ministry today. 
  The possibility of conducting joint military exercises was 
discussed last year during a working meeting between Russian and 
U.S. defense Ministers in Bavaria in summer, and during the 
visit by the Russian defense minister to the United States in 
autumn. A final agreement on joint exercises was reached at the 
January U.S.- Russian summit in Moscow.

  [Text] Lexington, Massachusetts February 3 (NEWSWIRE-TASS) 
-- The U.S. Raytheon engineers and constructors has announced 
that, as a participant in the German-American consortium 
established to build enterprises in Russia for the elimination 
of chemical weapons, it is taking part in working out a 
conceptual framework for designing and building one such 
enterprise near Saratov. 
  Raytheon engineers and constructors is a member of the U.S.- 
German consortium controlled by Lurgi environmental 
Participating Organisation Ltd (Lub/Lurgi Umweltbeteiligungs 
Geselschaft), which was awarded a contract by the Russian 
government to build a plant for the elimination of chemical 
weapons. 
  Other members of the consortium are German firms Uhde GMBH, 
a 
branch of Hoechst AG, Entsorgungs und Sanierungstechnik (EST), 
and a subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace. 
  As one of 130 consignees of the Paris convention banning 
chemical weapons, Russia, which joined it in January 1993, is 
obliged to eliminate all its materials designed for conducting 
chemical warfare before the year 2005. Russia has officially 
admitted that it has 40,000 tonnes of such materials. 
  The consortium brings together the world's two companies 
which have experience of operating chemical weapon elimination 
installations. Raytheon engineers and constructors installed 
and networked equipment for the single operating plant for the 
elimination of chemical weapons of the U.S. Army. It is located 
in the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The plant, operated 
by the same company, can destroy up to 1,000 tonnes of chemical 
agents annually. 
  Lurgi has been running and maintaining a similar plant for 
the German government in Lower Saxony since it was established 
in 1982. 
  The German Foreign Ministry in October 1993 allocated 3.2 
million DM (about two million U.S. dollars) to finance the phase 
of the development of the conceptual framework for the 
Lub/Saratov project. The working out of the conceptual framework 
is scheduled to be completed in March 1994. 
  Raytheon engineers and constructors is one of the major 
machine- building and construction companies in the world. This 
is one of the four spheres in which Raytheon (Nyse code rtn) is 
doing business. It specialises in various technologies, 
including production of electronic, aircraft and basic electric 
equipment. The company's capital totals nine billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  For more information please contact Raytheon agent Ed Powers 
at (617) 860-2415.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Committee for International Affairs and ambassador to the United 
States, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; 
from the "Russian Diary" foreign affairs program--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Lukin] I believe the 
country's foreign policy should be based on national interests 
and not on party or class interests. The blueprint for foreign 
policy should be based solely on formulating a national idea of 
foreign policy. The blueprint is taking shape as an 
understanding of the role of the new Russia in the surrounding 
world, in neighboring and distant foreign countries. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In whose head is it taking 
shape? In the Foreign Ministry on Smolenskaya Square or in the 
president's? 
  [Lukin] Perhaps you have noticed that lately, despite loud 
shouting and individual deviations, everyone agrees that our 
foreign policy should be more economical, more concerned with 
practical objectives, and more oriented toward neighboring 
foreign countries. It should be more concerned with its 
neighbors rather than with support for democracy in Haiti, for 
example, or the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. To a larger extent 
it should be directed at helping Russia itself surmount the 
crisis rather than at general turgid declarations and statements 
like setting up a world order led by the United Nations or by 
helping with one's troops in Latin America or God knows where. 
Such an idea is gradually taking shape. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What are the relations between the Duma 
committee for international affairs and Kozyrev and the Foreign 
Ministry? How will these relations develop? What is your 
prediction? And who is responsible for making what decisions? 
  [Lukin] It has become obvious already now that it is 
possible 
to agree on certain issues. For example, the Yugoslavia issue 
was discussed, and, except for some hasty and not very competent 
exotic statements, we essentially reached an agreement. We 
agreed on the statement on Yugoslavia which is very reasonable. 
Therefore, there is a possibility of reaching agreement. 
  As for who is responsible for what, under the Russian 
constitution, the president and the government pursue foreign 
policy. This is absolutely correct. Parliament should not 
implement foreign policy. They are implementing foreign policy 
into life. They are drawing up the main principles and rules of 
foreign policy. But parliament, whether the executive bodies 
want it or not, is a very essential and influential factor in 
formulating and implementing the foreign policy of the country. 
  [Correspondent] [passage omitted] 
  [Lukin] [passage omitted] Everything has changed now. Look, 
how much our relations with China have changed over the last few 
decades. Undoubtedly, we used to be a long way ahead of China 
in all respects. And now, except the nuclear field... [sentence 
unfinished as heard] 
  And our task now, of course, if we have a task, is to become 
a bridge linking the great Europe to the great Asia, not a 
bridge which one uses to walk on, but a connecting pole to 
combine the best European and Asian features.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Russian Vice Foreign Minister </F>
Aleksandr Panov by HANGUK ILBO Moscow-based correspondent Yi 
Chang-hun on 3 February] 
  [Text] [Yi] Reacting to a rumor about the deployment of 
U.S. Patriot missiles to the ROK, North Korea threatened that it 
will cancel the withholding of its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. As a result, the situation on 
the Korean peninsula is becoming alarming. Do you think that the 
U.S.-North Korea talks and talks between the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea will be successful? 
  [Panov] Russia does not think that U.S.-North Korea talks 
and IAEA-North Korea talks have been ruptured. Russia's 
position is that the talks should continue. The North Korean 
nuclear issue should be resolved under the IAEA's control for 
peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. There were some 
successes, although limited, in U.S.-North Korea talks in the 
past. However, the talks were recently suspended and many 
difficult problems are laid on the road toward a third round of 
talks. 
  Russia is discussing the North Korean nuclear problem with 
the United States and China, not to mention the ROK, and there 
are no remarkable differences in the positions of each nation. 
  These nations share the view that North Korea should settle 
nuclear negotiation with the IAEA at an early date and should 
accept the nuclear inspection. 
  [Yi] What is your view on the possibility and prospects for 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as discussed during 
U.S.-Russia summit and talks between Russian and Chinese foreign 
ministers? 
  [Panov] The only way toward the resolution of 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at present is to bring 
about concrete fruition in U.S.-North Korea talks and in 
IAEA-North Korea talks. Although talks are very difficult and 
may face a stumbling block, it is important to continue the 
talks in a manner of dialogue. 
  [Yi] What is your opinion on the multilateral security 
cooperation system proposed by the ROK for peace and stability 
on the Korean peninsula? 
  [Panov] Russia basically supports this. This plan is a 
method enabling one to resolve various problems pertaining to 
security on the Korean peninsula, including the North Korean 
nuclear issue. The relevant countries are making efforts to 
achieve this plan. 
  The ROK established diplomatic relations with Russia and 
China. What is left as a pending issue is North Korea's 
normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. If 
the North Korean nuclear problem is solved and normalization of 
relations is achieved, an important progress will be registered 
in efforts to promote security on the Korean peninsula and in 
the Northeast Asia. 
  [Yi] Do you think the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary 
system will proceed smoothly in North Korea? 
  [Panov] I debated on this issue with relevant American and 
ROK figures when I served as Russian Ambassador in Seoul. We 
have drawn a conclusion that it is difficult to predict how the 
North Korean society will change in the future. Since North 
Korea is an extremely closed society and flow of information is 
restricted, analysis and assessment of the practical situation 
on the progress of the hereditary system are very difficult. 
However, international society shares the view that 
stabilization in North Korea's political situation is important. 
  [Yi] When do you think President Kim Yong-sam will visit 
Russia and what are the important agendas? 
  [Panov] Russia is hoping that President Kim will visit 
within this year, and is preparing for this. We believe that 
with President Kim's visit as an occasion, the two nations will 
solve the pending issues including Russia's debt to the ROK, and 
will further promote cooperation in various domains of relations 
between the two countries including domains of politics, 
economy, and culture. 
  [Yi] What is your opinion on the possibility of expanding 
economic cooperation between the two countries and on proper 
means for a solution to Russia's debt to the ROK? 
  [Panov] The amount of trade between the two countries last 
year was $1.5 billion--a 40 percent increase from the previous 
year--and the amount is expected to increase further. We are 
well aware that because of uneasiness in the political situation 
in Russia, ROK businessmen from small and medium-size 
enterprises are reluctant to advance to Russia. However, Russia 
will be stabilized in the future. For example in cooperative 
relations between Russia and the ROK, a ROK firm advanced to 
Russia's Far Eastern district through the introduction of the 
Russian Embassy in the ROK, and established a joint-venture 
textile plant there. This firm has earned a great amount of 
interest by exporting its products to the United States. ROK 
businessmen, who wish to advance to Russia, may inquire of 
Russian Embassy in Seoul about method and procedure of advance. 
Since reshuffle of Russian cabinet members was carried out 
recently, I cannot tell you precisely at this moment about the 
method as to how the Russian Government will resolve the issue 
of its debt to the ROK and of its interest payment. At present, 
relevant officials within the Russian Government are exchanging 
their views on measures for solving the problem.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The reports of some mass 
media that Russian scientists participated in creation of 
nuclear weapons in Pyongyang absolutely contradict the reality, 
Ambassador of North Korea in Moscow Son Sung-pil told ITAR-TASS 
on Friday. 
  North Korea never had a military nuclear programme. The 
research in atomic energy was of an exclusively peaceful 
character, he noted. 
  The ambassador said the former Soviet Union rendered 
assistance to North Korea in various spheres. In those years, 
Soviet specialists, including nuclear energy experts, worked in 
the republic. However, now there are no Russian atomic experts 
in North Korea. 
  According to Son Sung-pil, Japanese mass media are 
initiators 
of various fabrications on the topic. It is not by accident, 
because "Japan has all the necessary components for creating 
nuclear weapons", he said. 
  "It is quite possible that certain circles of that country 
are interested that the world community's attention is attracted 
by the fuss about the alleged threat from North Korea, using it 
as a ground and excuse to create their own atomic bomb", the 
ambassador stressed.

<F P=106> [From the "Today's World" program] </F>
  [Text] We will talk about the possibility of resolving 
diplomatically the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  This concerns a plan under which the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] will inspect the DPRK nuclear facilities to 
confirm whether any attempt is made to produce atomic weapons in 
those facilities. 
  DPRK and IAEA representatives have held several rounds of 
talks on inspections. However, the IAEA says it could not find 
a solution to this DPRK issue. 
  Of course, [words indistinct] in connection with nuclear 
inspections aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula, and 
[words indistinct]. 
  Washington warns that unless the DPRK resolves the issue 
concerning international nuclear inspections by 21 February, it 
will present this to the UN Security Council for deliberations. 
  The United States says international economic sanctions 
[kyongje cheje chochi] can be imposed on the DPRK. 
  Moscow has different views on resolving the nuclear crisis 
on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  At a news conference, Mikhail Demurin, a Russian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman [as heard], said: 
  [Begin Demurin, recording in Russian fading into Korean] The 
Russian Foreign Ministry thinks diplomatic means to resolve the 
nuclear issue have not been completely exhausted. Therefore, it 
is necessary to persistently and continuously try to find 
solutions to all the problems. [end recording] 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman also said: Russia is 
working in three directions. Russia supports dialogue between 
the DPRK and the United States, dialogue between the DPRK and 
the IAEA, and dialogue between the North and South of Korea. 
  He stressed that it is fully possible to solve the problem 
of 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula by 
working in these directions. 
  Russian Ambassador to the ROK Georgiy Kunadze has the same 
view. He told the YONHAP News Agency that no tactics of pressure 
must be used against the DPRK and that the DPRK must not be 
driven to a difficult situation. 
  We concur with these remarks. It is clear how Pyongyang will 
react if further pressure is brought on it. This may bring 
about an opposite result. Therefore, diplomatic efforts will be 
better than the tactics of ultimatum or pressure in resolving 
the nuclear issue on the peninsula.

  [Text] In an interview with a ITAR-TASS reporter on Friday 
[4 February], the DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil pointed 
out that the allegation that Russian nuclear physics scholars 
participated in Pyongyang's nuclear arms development is 
groundless and false. 
  Stressing that the DPRK has never implemented any military 
nuclear program, he said that the DPRK has limited research 
projects to totally peace-oriented nuclear energy development. 
  The DPRK ambassador pointed out that Japanese press 
organizations have spread such a false rumor.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report: "Provincial Officials Like </F>
Chinese Goods. And They Do Not Like Officials from Moscow"] 
  [Text] Blagoveshchensk, Beijing, Shenzhen, Xi'an, Moscow 
-- "Finally, Russia's interests and statewide discipline must 
not be forgotten." After the speaker had pronounced these words 
the audience seemed stunned into hostile silence for a few 
moments. 
  The venue: The conference hall at the Amur Oblast 
administration building in Blagoveshchensk. On the rostrum -- 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The audience -- 
participants in the conference of representatives of Far East 
administrations responsible for questions of the development of 
Russian-Chinese relations. Before the official visit to China 
the head of the foreign policy department had decided to canvas 
the opinions of regional leaders on border trade and free 
economic zones and intended to familiarize himself with the 
experience of the creation of such zones in the PRC. There is 
something to discuss here: In 1993 the volume of border trade 
reached $2.5 billion and the trend is upward. 
  However, the times when the words of government members were 
greeted with reverence in the provinces have long since gone. 
Hardly had the minister ended his speech than the heads of 
administration took the platform to bombard him with a barrage 
of demands which amounted to a few simple tenets: Because of 
the disintegration of the USSR and the economic crisis China has 
become a more advantageous partner for the Russian Far East than 
other regions of Russia. The introduction of the visa regime 
for holders of general civilian passports in Russia and the PRC 
is a severe blow to trade ties: Either give us credits or give 
us a free hand to trade with the Chinese in the free economic 
zones which ought to be set up immediately and moreover financed 
by Moscow or rather by reducing our contributions to the state 
budget. To summarize: Russia's interests are important but our 
own are even more important. 
  The administration heads quite ostentatiously ignored one of 
Kozyrev's main ideas: The introduction of the visa regime was 
necessary to halt the process of the uncontroled spread of 
criminal elements from China into Russian territory. Taking 
advantage of the ease of passage into the border regions, they 
then set off on their "travels." According to some statistics 
there are over 1 million "guests" of this kind in our country. 
  After the conference, Kozyrev went to visit the free trade 
zone in the city of Heihe (PRC) on the opposite bank of the 
River Amur. The friendly embraces of the Chinese leaders with 
the Blagoveshchensk city fathers, and equally the tone -- which 
sounded almost like an ultimatum -- which the hospitable hosts 
of Heihe took during their conversation with the minister, left 
no doubts: Ties between the local elites are strengthening and 
developing regardless of Moscow's wishes. 
  The things that the party and economic leaders from Heihe 
said coincided almost word for word with the demands of the 
heads of administrations at the conference: They want the 
relaxation of the visa regime and the construction of a bridge 
across the Amur (the pet theme of Amur Oblast administration 
head Polivanov). You ought to have seen Kozyrev when he said in 
measured and firm tones after enduring an almost 40-minute 
verbal attack from the Chinese: "I hope that the Chinese side 
will treat with understanding the measures undertaken by the 
Russian side in the sphere of visa control." And he added 
significantly: "We are worried by some guests who, I am sure, 
give you no peace either." There was no reaction. 
  It is interesting that after visiting two free economic 
zones 
in the PRC -- at Heihe and Shenzhen in the southern province of 
Guangdong -- the minister came to the conclusion that it is 
impossible in Russia's conditions to copy the Chinese experience 
-- or indeed any other experience. "We must find our own path 
taking into account certain elements of foreign practice," he 
noted. 
  When speaking in Blagoveshchensk and in China Kozyrev 
repeatedly called for a switch from primitive "shuttle" trade 
and elementary barter in the border oblasts to more serious 
joint projects of a production and investment character. No one 
has rejected these proposals in public but no one has been in a 
hurry to develop the idea either. Is it because it is 
unprofitable? 
  Among the Russian foreign minister's first ideas to be 
expressed was that of the active participation of the regions in 
foreign economic activity. But I think that for him the Far 
East was a difficult test. The pressure of the local 
administrative and economic hierarchy defending their corporate 
interests was noticeable even to outside observers. The Russia 
of the regions has unfortunately already been transformed into 
the Russia of regional bosses.

  Commenting on the "Zhirinovskiy factor" Deputy Russian 
Foreign Minister, Aleksandr Panov, told Interfax that Japan had 
responded to the statements of the LDP [Liberal Democratic 
Party] leader "rather calmly." 
  According to the diplomat, "it was very difficult to 
determine the true position of Zhirinovskiy." Panov reminded 
that Zhirinovskiy had stated in his book The Last Breakthrough 
to the South his preparedness to give the Kuril Islands to Japan 
if he came to power, however, he failed to even mention the 
number of the islands which were to be given. Moreover, 
according to the information received by the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, the LDP leader stated the same position during 
conversations with Japanese representatives. However, on the 
other hand Zhirinovskiy said that he might threaten Japanese 
with a nuclear bomb, Panov remarked. 
  On the Japan visit by Director of the foundation Strategy, 
Gennadiy Burbulis, the deputy Russian foreign minister informed 
that Burbulis' visit was made so as to participate in the 
trilateral Japanese-U.S.-Russian conference on security in Tokyo. 
  Comparing the current situation in Russian-Japanese 
relations 
to the one last year, the deputy foreign minister pointed out a 
"significant move forward." In his opinion, the parties realize 
that it is necessary to create the appropriate atmosphere in 
many domains in order to resolve "very complex" issues 
concerning both states. "Both parties understand this very 
well. We believe that we have prospects for further development 
in our relations," Panov concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in the "Concept" </F>
column: "Following an `Asiatic' Path Toward a Security System 
in Asia. Russia Has No Irreconcilable Contradictions With the 
Asian Pacific Rim Countries" -- "abridged version of Andrey 
Kozyrev's statement on 27 January to the Chinese People's 
Diplomacy Association"] 
  [Text] The realization of Russia's interests not through 
confrontation but cooperation with the outside world has allowed 
us to a very large extent to reopen for ourselves a whole number 
of Asian states. This refers to China, our great eastern 
neighbor. After agonizing vacillations from ideologized 
indiscriminate friendship to just as unwarranted and 
unrestrained hostility, the two "mainlands" of civilization -- 
Russia and China -- have confidently embarked down the path of 
good-neighborliness and cooperation. 
  In formulating Russia's foreign policy, we proceed from the 
strategic character of good-neighborly relations with the 
Chinese People's Republic. Its main points of departure along 
the Asian Pacific direction are as follows: 
  First. The region's importance for the future of Russia is 
increasing. Primarily because the economic role of the Asian 
part of our country is growing. Here, some major tasks are to 
be resolved in building up the production of energy resources, 
converting military industry enterprises, developing 
communications, and providing amenities for the cities. The 
significance of our ties with our Asian neighbors is also 
increasing. They account for a third of our foreign trade. 
  Second. The system of interstate relations in the region, 
just as, incidentally, in the world at large, is and will be not 
mono- polar, not bipolar, but multipolar. The ideology of 
regional or global alliances of some countries in the 
Asia-Pacific Rim against others is becoming history now. The 
future of the region lies not in power rivalry but in 
cooperation and interaction between the leading powers. 
  Russia proceeds from the importance of maintaining stable 
and 
balanced relations with all of the Asian Pacific states. This 
principle underlies our treaty with China, India, the United 
States of America, and the Republic of Korea and also our links 
with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We are seeking 
to apply the same principles in building our relations with 
Japan and the ASEAN member states. In so doing, we believe that 
in the Asia-Pacific Rim there are no powers or groupings with 
which we have irreconcilable contradictions. We are striving to 
make the Commonwealth of Independent States, created jointly 
with our partners, a major factor of stability in the Eurasian 
space. 
  Third. The danger of large military conflicts arising in the 
region today is the lowest since the times of World War II. The 
importance of the military factor has diminished noticeably. At 
the same time there is a considerable potential of tension, not 
only inherited from the "cold war" but also caused by new 
problems. This involves the issue of access to the resources of 
the Pacific Ocean, including its sea bed, and a number of border 
disputes. The rise of religious and nationalist extremism has 
dramatically manifested itself in Afghanistan and is threatening 
Tajikistan. Unless we jointly attend to these problems in Asia, 
we will run the risk of ending up with a fairly "explosive 
substance." 
  Fourth. The economic role of the Asian Pacific Region, which 
accounts for 60 percent of the world's industrial output, will 
continue to grow dynamically in the future. In this respect the 
21st century will undoubtedly be a "century of the Pacific." 
The international positions of the Asian states will be 
primarily conditioned by the extent of their involvement in 
business relations in this region and their participation in the 
associations emerging here. We proceed from the assumption that 
such a buildup of national might does not threaten neighbors, 
but quite the contrary creates in the Asian Pacific Region 
conditions for dynamic economic growth necessary to all of us. 
We have welcomed China's participation in the recent meeting of 
the Asian Pacific Economic Union member states in Seattle as a 
major event for the whole of this region. For our part we hope 
that friendly China will render us assistance in integrating 
into the main economic associations in our region. 
  Fifth. In Asia, just as in other regions of the world, 
economic progress contributes to progress in ensuring 
fundamental human rights and freedoms. "To respect others like 
yourself and to treat them as we wish to be treated." This 
universal law of morality, formulated by Confucius, has become a 
prototype of universal contemporary human rights. The World 
Human Rights Conference in October 1993 called for their 
comprehensive observance. 
  On the whole, we favor a phased formation of a joint 
security system, a kind of "security community" open to all. We 
should move toward such a system taking into account the 
experience of other regions, for example, Europe, but in our own 
"Asiatic" way. Here, the following criteria are applicable in 
particular: 
  -- a phased, possibly multi-speed and multi-optional, 
approach based on the real readiness of particular states for 
participation in concrete security structures; 
  -- consideration for the specifics of bilateral ties and the 
situation inside the sub-regions, and movement from local 
accords to a diversified regional structure; 
  -- ascent from simple forms of cooperation (exchange of 
military information, confidence measures, and so forth) to more 
complex forms (joint situation management measures). 
  To this end Russia proposes to start creating a regional 
conflict prevention center and to establish a regional institute 
for security studies. We also propose to work out principles of 
the arms trade in the Asian Pacific region. They must be based 
on the Basic Guidelines worked out by the five permanent UN 
Security Council members. The application of such principles 
would impede outside "arms feeding" of current and future 
conflict situations in the region. On the other hand, it is 
important to preclude attempts to hamper normal commercial 
transactions on the arms market under far- fetched pretexts. 
"Double standards" are inadmissible here. 
  Russia and China can make a major joint contribution to 
security and cooperation in the Asian Pacific region. I think 
that all the prerequisites are there for us to enter a new stage 
of interrelations -- the stage of constructive partnership. 
  The geographical center of Asia is in the town of Kyzyl, on 
Russian territory. This shows just how absurd it is for Russia 
to oppose the "western" European to the "eastern" Asian 
direction in its foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Gryzunov, Andrey Baturin, RIA's own </F>
correspondents in Belgrade, specially for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
under the "Balkans" rubric: "Initiative Regained. Zhirinovskiy 
Was the First To Visit Yugoslavia After the December Elections, 
Now They Wait for Zyuganov"] 
  [Text] The Yugoslav problem, or rather approaches to its 
solution, is becoming not only a weapon of political struggle in 
high echelons of power in Russia, but also an apple of discord 
between our country and its allies in the West. But if formerly 
the Serb card was played only by a part of the former Supreme 
Soviet in the struggle against the president, now Yeltsin's and 
Kozyrev's stand on the Balkans is opposed by a mighty State Duma 
bloc, where the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], the 
communists, and nonaligned conservatives may become the main 
sources of trouble. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's current visit to Yugoslavia is a 
case 
in point. Now they are waiting in Belgrade for Gennadiy 
Zyuganov, who was invited by the New Communist Movement, a party 
that garnered 18,000 votes in the latest elections. 
  The fantastic promises and statements Zhirinovskiy lavishly 
made in Vukovar and Podgorice, in Bosnia and Slovenia, might be 
dismissed as hysteria and paranoia. No other representative of 
the Russian leadership, however, has thought it necessary to 
come here and explain to ordinary folks by word and deed, just 
like that, face to face, raising a glass and breaking bread, the 
essence of Russia's Balkan policy. 
  At present, the initiative is obviously held by the 
nationalistic patriots and communists. The democratic reformers 
still keep the Yugoslav problem on the back burner and keep 
losing -- points, so far; tomorrow, maybe, their heads. The 
personalities of Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov elicit mixed feelings 
both in Moscow and in Belgrade. The fact remains, however, that 
Zhirinovskiy is the first Russian deputy and prominent figure in 
Russia to have come to this country after the December 
elections. If we recall that before the October events in 
Moscow it was also deputies -- Achalov, Pavlov, Isakov, 
Konstantinov and their ilk -- who visited Belgrade, the picture 
will be complete. 
  Those who invited Zhirinovskiy expected that his visit would 
raise the spirits of the Serbs and the Montenegrins. Both -- 
those who are weary of living in trenches for the third year 
running, and ordinary citizens, whose patience in not limitless 
in the conditions of sanctions and blockade. 
  The expectations of the tour's organizers were fulfilled. At 
a time when the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is bracing for a 
new spiral -- either a scenario involving force; or the 
partition of the scorched country between the Croats and the 
Serbs; or lifting the ban on arms sales to the Muslims; or yet 
more unexpected options -- Zhirinovskiy told Serbs that they 
are no longer alone. That there is a party that will change 
Russia's foreign policy, send an army to their rescue, and give 
them new secret weapons. 
  Maybe that is precisely what earned the LDPR leader the 
first 
order in his career. It happened at a little-publicized dinner 
in Belgrade, which was organized in the Russian guest's honor by 
Arkan, a man wanted by police of a number of European countries 
and by Interpol. A former criminal turned leader of the Serb 
Unity Party, who has made millions of dollars out of the war, 
decorated Zhirinovskiy with an order that had formerly been 
given only to Arkan's own hitmen. 
  The consequences of the visit are easy to predict. As early 
as this Saturday Zhirinovskiy promised to hold a rally in 
Moscow. At the Duma he will do his utmost to crush the already 
fragile positions of his political opponents under the slogan of 
saving Orthodox brothers. The international community, 
threatened with a reemerging idea of carving up the world into 
blocs and unleashing a new war, which would not necessarily be 
cold, will change its strategy and tactics with regard to Russia. 
  The phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov, the alliance of 
the nationalistic patriots and communists, is a qualitatively 
new development in the former Eastern bloc countries. It is 
neither pure fascism nor communism. As Adam Michnik fittingly 
put it, it is a mixture of the idea of an ethnically pure state 
with populist rhetoric and a nostalgia for stability under 
dictatorship. This trend is currently thriving all across the 
former Yugoslavia, from Zagreb to Belgrade. That is why as soon 
as they heard familiar music from Moscow, Vladimir Volfovich's 
Yugoslav counterparts invited him to reinforce their orchestra.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1800 GMT on 5 February carries the 
"Novosti" newscast, which includes a video report on the 
conflict in Bosnia citing reaction to the UN Security Council's 
decision to approve air strikes in support of UN forces. The 
video report shows clips from the visit of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia, in Serbia; a brief interview with Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic; and scenes of fighting and Geneva talks. The 
program also includes short interviews by unidentified 
correspondents with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev; 
Colonel Sergey Voznesenskiy, the commander of a Russian 
battalion in the UN forces; and Presidential Council member 
Sergey Karaganov. No indication was given when or where the 
interviews were recorded. 
  A correspondent asks Kozyrev what the chances are for a 
peaceful settlement in Bosnia in the "foreseeable future." 
Kozyrev replies: "First, there is no other way. Second, 
foreseeable future is a fairly elastic concept. I think that 
there is still a chance -- perhaps even in the immediate future, 
perhaps after another round of exchanging blows -- the sides 
will return to Geneva and, in general terms, 95 percent of the 
plan could be agreed very quickly, and about 5 percent, we 
believe, could be handed over to international arbitration. 
This is one of the special features of the Russian initiative 
on Yugoslavia, that is, for that 5 percent. That's not very 
much in terms of territory." 
  Commenting on the possibility of air strikes against Serb 
positions, Col. Voznesenskiy says: "The selective air strikes 
planned in the interests of protecting UN forces won't, in 
general terms, solve the conflict that has arisen in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moreover, I believe that it will entail 
stepped up activity by the sides against UN forces, which will 
entail losses among UN forces and their being taken hostage. 
And, of course, there will be retaliatory measures, mass 
strikes that will lead to great human losses, and destruction, 
and it cannot be ruled out that the conflict that exists in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will spread far beyond the borders of the 
former Yugoslavia." 
  A correspondent asks Presidential Council member Karaganov: 
"Where will the Bosnian crisis end and when?" He replies: "I 
think that it will last another year or two, until the sides 
exhaust their moral, economic, and other resources and then 
perhaps the most unpleasant thing that can happen will occur. 
The former Yugoslavia, and primarily Bosnia, will be divided by 
force of arms. One of the main postulates of the new European 
politics over the last few decades will be finally breached, 
maliciously and irrevocably -- the inadmissibility of changing 
borders by force of arms. Bosnia will be carved up by Croatia 
and Serbia, and the Muslims will get what they are given -- but 
this will be a deeply unjust solution. To my great regret I can 
say that the world will reconcile itself with this."

the act of terrorism in Sarajevo that led to the deaths of many 
citizens of this city, which has suffered so much," says a 
statement of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry issued

objective investigation and to inform the world public about its 
findings". "Those guilty of this atrocity, whoever they are, 
must be severely punished", the Russian Foreign Ministry 
statement stresses. 
  As already reported, about 60 people were killed and over 
200 
injured on Saturday when a mortar shell exploded.

  [Text] Russia must use every tool available to prevent the 
use of force by NATO in Bosnia, Andranik Migranian, Presidential 
Council member, told Interfax Monday [7 February]. In the view 
of this well-known political scientist, all sides must show 
restraint until a thorough and impartial investigation has been 
held of all circumstances under which 68 people were killed and 
nearly 200 injured in a recent blast in Sarajevo. 
  Migranian believes that the debate of the possibility of air 
strikes against Bosnian Serbs has contributed to "a nervous 
atmosphere in which one of the warring parties is tempted into 
hurrying things up and the other is continuously on the verge of 
failing to restrain itself." He emphasized: "It is an abnormal 
situation in which the prey has been determined in advance, 
which is a source of tension in itself." 
  "A strike against Serbians is indeed likely to prove to be a 
strike against Russia," Migranian said. He insisted that the 
Russian public should not be misled into believing that Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader, was the 
sole force in the Russian political spectrum that was friendly 
towards Serbia. He recalled a State Duma resolution, adopted by 
a huge majority, that rejected placing all the blame for the 
conflict on one side and called for lifting the sanctions 
against Serbia. 
  "Russian diplomacy's non-resistance in the face of NATO's 
improper intentions and of further dangerous escalation of the 
Yugoslav crisis can result in a dramatic escalation of the 
political strife in Russia and harm President Boris Yeltsin's 
image," Migranian emphasized.

held a telephone conversation with the U.S. secretary of state 
during which the two men discussed the problem of a Bosnian 
settlement. Galina Sidorova, adviser to the Russian foreign 
minister, said that air strikes against any of the warring sides 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be justified if they prompted these 
sides to accept a compromise. However, she feels that in 
present circumstances, such strikes would only lead to a further 
brutalization of the conflict.

  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- Two Russo-French 
intergovernmental agreements -- on defence cooperation and on 
military-techical cooperation -- were signed in the Russian 
Defence Ministry on Friday. This is the chief result of talks 
between General of the Army Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of 
defence, and his French counterpart, Francois Leotard, who is 
currently in Russia on an official visit. 
  The defence cooperation agreement provides for exchanges of 
military delegations and consultations on defence matters. The 
military-technical cooperation accord envisages joint tackling 
of defence industry conversion matters, the development of some 
types of armaments and military hardware, those for the Air 
Force, in particular, and the coordination of matters concerning 
arms trade with third countries. 
  The agreements signed bring Russia and France to a 
qualitatively new level of relations, the two ministers 
emphasised during their meeting. 
  M. Leotard together with Grachev visited the Taman Guards 
Motorised Rifle Division, took in specimens of arms and combat 
hardware, and familiarised himself with the living conditions of 
personnel. 
  The French guest's trip to the Tula Airborne Division, 
scheduled for Friday, has been cancelled.

  [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has warned 
against bombing Serbian positions in Bosnia. Such a strike, in 
his opinion, could be delivered only if Serbian troops engage 
the peacekeepers. According to Grachev, Russia's position is 
that a decision on a bombing raid should only be made by the UN 
Security Council rather than by the peacekeeping forces' command. 
  He outlined this position at his meeting with his French 
counterpart Francois Leotard in Moscow on Friday. 
  Commenting on the conflict in former Yugoslavia, Grachev 
said 
that to secure a cease-fire in Bosnia, Russia would press for 
"equally restraining" not only the Bosnian Serbs but also the 
Croatian and Moslem communities. 
  Explaining his government's position on a settlement in 
Bosnia, Grachev urged the conflicting sides to call a 
cease-fire, ensure the passage of humanitarian relief convoys, 
and guarantee security in the region.

  [Text] Moscow February 5 TASS -- Both Moscow and Paris 
favour a further development of Russian-French cooperation, 
specifically, in the military-technical and conversion spheres, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and French Defence 
Minister Francois Leotard, now on a visit here, announced today 
at their meeting in the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  Welcoming the French defence minister, Kozyrev pointed out 
that Russia and France, the military and the diplomats of the 
two countries, had traditionally maintained close ties. The 
Russian Foreign Ministry is maintaining the same relations with 
the Russian Defence Ministry and Minister Pavel Grachev. "We 
even agreed with our minister to create `allied 
military-diplomatic troops'," Kozyrev joked. This does not 
mean, however, that Russian imperialism is being revived, he 
continued and urged not to believe such allegations. "What is 
being revived is the normal statehood of Russia," Kozyrev 
stressed. 
  "Our talks in Moscow are an integral part of the overall 
efforts, aimed at the development of bilateral relations and 
cooperation and the revival of the Russian-French alliance in a 
new setting," he said. 
  The ministers discussed problems dealing with the 
strengthening of stability on the European continent, the 
Bosnian settlement and the staging of peace-keeping operations, 
including on the territory of the former USSR. The conversation 
was held in an atmosphere, which reflected the relations of 
partnership taking shape between Russia and France.

  [Text] Moscow February 5 TASS -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard described the results of his first official 
visit to Russia as "positive." 
  Speaking at a briefing at Moscow's Balchug Hotel on Saturday 
[5 February], Leotard said that during his four-day official 
visit he met with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, 
Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov and other officials to 
discuss the problems facing Russia, including conflict 
settlement and peace-keeping operations. 
  The French defence minister said the main results of the 
visit was the signing of the Russian-French inter-governmental 
agreements on defence, military and technical cooperation. 
  Speaking about the content of these documents, Leotard 
stressed that they are designed to develop the ideas which had 
been discussed during the visits to France by First Vice-Prime 
Minister Oleg Soskovets, First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev last autumn. 
  The talks which focused mostly on the conversion of the 
Russian defence industry resulted in a package of Russian-French 
agreements on cooperation to dismantle nuclear weapons in Russia 
and increase the safety of their transportation. 
  Leotard believes the key to peace lies in friendship and 
cooperation between France and Russia. He stressed the need to 
exert every possible effort to strengthen these ties of trust. 
  According to Leotard, Russia is the country which is seeking 
a path to democracy and trying to bring its Armed Forces under 
political control. This corresponds to France's own values, he 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Kozyrev] We view the signing of the 
[Russo-Georgian] treaty as an incentive for further efforts to 
regulate the conflicts that are worrying us in Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia and for securing the human rights of national 
minorities. The treaty will come into full force only after 
this is done. The treaty will be ratified but, for the time 
being, it is important that the treaty serve as an incentive on 
these issues and not a substitute. 
  [Correspondent] In Sochi you declared that Russia had legal, 
historical, and strategic interests in the Transcaucasus. How 
will these interests reflect on the Abkhaz issue? 
  [Kozyrev] This issue should be regulated in such a way that 
would allow Georgian integrity. At the same time, the status of 
Abkhazia will be defined so that peace is established in Georgia. 
  [Correspondent] How can that be done? 
  [Kozyrev] It is an issue for negotiation.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] As is known, the first official 
visit to Georgia by the president of Russia has aroused a bitter 
polemic in the mass media. The results of the talks are also 
being subjected to quite a lot of criticism. In particular, the 
opponents of this visit consider that the Treaty on Friendship, 
Good-neighborliness, and Cooperation that has been signed will 
set in motion a new spiral of escalation of tension in the 
Caucasus. Let us listen to what Emil Pain, member of the 
Presidential Council, who was a member of the Russian delegation 
to Tbilisi, thinks about this: 
  [Begin Pain recording] I think that the objections that are 
being put forward against the treaty are groundless, for a 
number of reasons. In the first place, uncertainty about 
Russia's attitude to the integrity of Georgia to a considerable 
extent stimulates the outbreak and escalation of conflicts. 
Second, it is the third point of the treaty that has aroused 
the greatest criticism; in accordance with this point Russia 
pledges to help with the development of Georgia's regular army. 
But this point is closely linked with a political settlement of 
the Georgian-Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian conflicts. And for 
the first time the Georgian side at the talks has agreed with 
the idea that Georgia could resolve its political problems with 
the autonomies along the path of the federalization of Georgia, 
that is, on the path by which relations are constructed between 
the center and the autonomies in the Russian Federation. 
  Perhaps the most important result of this visit was that the 
Georgians put their trust in the good-neighborliness and good 
intentions of Russia toward that country that is now on the 
verge of catastrophe. [passage omitted] 
  I think that the suggestion that no treaty should be 
concluded with Georgia because its relations with Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia are unresolved is groundless, because similar 
contradictions exist in virtually all the post-Soviet states. 
[passage omitted] 
  Furthermore, it is quite impermissible to impose any 
particular model of political development on another country 
that is recognized by world society as independent. We may say 
that today federalization is one of the best models; it, to the 
greatest extent, resolves the problems of interrelations between 
the central authorities and the autonomies, but to directly 
include in the treaty conditions specifying federalization or, 
even more so, the granting of independence to some of its 
components, is impermissible. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The results of the Russian-Georgian summit talks 
were commented on, specially for Mayak, by Emil Pain, the 
director of the Ethno-Political Research Center and member of 
the Presidential Council.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party, said his party's group in the State Duma would 
unanimously vote against the ratification of the 
Russian-Georgian Treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighborly Relations 
and Cooperation signed in Tbilisi on Thursday [3 February]. 
  "Two hundred years ago Georgia became part of Russia forever 
as Tiflis [Tbilisi] Province and had no right to secede. For us 
Georgia is a state that does not exist," Zhirinovskiy told 
Interfax. 
  He said Georgia should be allowed to exist on its own, 
"without Russian subsidies, without our assistance." "Let 
Turkish troops come and show them what Turkish democracy means 
if they don't want Russian democracy," he said.

  [Text] Though finding it necessary to sign a treaty between 
Russia and Georgia, the Minister for Ethnic and Regional 
Policies, Sergey Shakhray, objects to the wording of the treaty. 
  Addressing journalists in Moscow on Saturday, he said: To 
preserve Georgia's territorial integrity, as a condition for 
stability in the region, and ensure the status of autonomy for 
Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ajaria, would answer to Russia's 
strategic interests. 
  "In my view, the ideal model for Georgia would be federal 
system," Shakhray said. "There is no other way to preserve 
Georgia's territorial integrity and stop the civil war and 
ethnic conflicts there." 
  According to him, there should have been a preliminary 
condition for signing the bilateral treaty: the understanding 
that Russia will act as the guarantor of the autonomous status 
of republics within Georgia, without interfering in Georgia's 
internal affairs. 
  Since this has not been stipulated, the treaty may become a 
pretext for destabilizing the situation even before its 
ratification, Shakhray said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Soskovets, Russian first deputy prime </F>
minister, by reporter A. Peslyak in Moscow on 5 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] A good two-thirds of the 25 Russian-Georgian 
documents signed in Tbilisi apply to the economic relations 
sphere. We asked Oleg Soskovets, the Russian first deputy prime 
minister, to characterize the results of the agreements and 
treaties that were signed. [Video shows footage of Yeltsin, 
Shevardnadze, and others at documents-signing ceremony in 
Tbilisi. Then Oleg Soskovets is shown seated in his office being 
interviewed] 
  [Soskovets] Let us take the agreement on cooperation in the 
communications field. What does it signify? It signifies that 
our television programs -- the Ostankino and Russian Television 
programs -- will be regularly relayed, received, and shown to 
Georgia's inhabitants and the whole region. I think that a 
legal format has simply been given to all those relationships 
that were developing previously as part of the traditional old 
relations of partnership. Now they have been endorsed at the 
level of interstate relations. Now the old laws have a 
foundation. In principle, Georgia is an independent state and 
whether it uses our television programs and information sources 
depends on many things, since in principle we must now work on a 
commercial basis with this state. 
  An agreement was signed on international highway 
communications. This is also a matter purely of production 
links. They existed traditionally in the former Soviet Union. 
Now they need to be given a legal format in line with 
international law. Well, they have now been legalized. 
  Agreements were signed on trade and economic cooperation 
with 
the appropriate appendices. I should like to dwell precisely on 
this area, which is the most complicated at the present time, as 
Georgia, since it acquired its independence, has been busy 
working on its own economic policy and industry reform. At 
present both of these spheres of activity are in difficulties, 
especially industry, power- generating, and transport. It is 
therefore, necessary, in view of Georgia becoming a CIS member, 
to find approaches that will not unite the two economies but, 
with them functioning quite independently of each other, will 
provide opportunities for them to develop various production 
infrastructures. In this respect the Georgian side has been 
displaying considerable interest in Russian industrial 
enterprises and power-generating enterprises. During the 
negotiating process proposals were made to the Georgian 
Government that Russian joint-stock companies and joint-stock 
capital should become involved in Georgia's industrial and 
oil-refining enterprises. Georgia now possesses fine transport 
potential in view of its ports, and I think that, given a normal 
development of events, we shall simply be involved at the 
economic level and economically in the production activity of 
these infrastructures. This was a more serious agreement, since 
here there can be no question of any disinterested links that 
might weaken Russia's economy, as ways are being sought to 
create financial clearing relations, since Georgia has its own 
currency. Let me reiterate that there can be no philanthropic 
relationship where the Russian enterprises, which are now the 
real economic subjects in our economic zone, will not receive 
the funds for the output they supply. Nor, naturally, must our 
companies, such as Roskontrakt, which are involved in giving 
substance to these relations in respect of goods, be bankrupted 
by this cooperation. This is one of the main tasks that we have 
set ourselves. We explained this to the Georgian side and it 
was received quite normally, as should be the case in a 
civilized world. 
  [Peslyak] What can you say more specifically about 
power-generating, transport, and other areas of bilateral links? 
  [Soskovets] Georgia still has a metallurgical industry, 
which 
had earlier been transformed into one of the Soviet Union's 
unified metallurgical complexes. It still has a deposit of 
manganese ores, without which it is impossible to produce steel. 
It also still has units for the production of ferrous alloys in 
Zestafoni, manganese in Chiatura, and there is the iron and 
steel works at Rustavi. These enterprises, especially the 
enterprise in Rustavi, were oriented toward the oil industry 
market. They make extra-strong oil well casing. I think that 
we must not lose this production capacity, enabling us to have 
high-quality piping for the oil men that is, at the same time, 
between 30 and 40 percent cheaper than world prices, and that we 
must not neglect it. I think that it is essential to avail 
ourselves of this opportunity and to organize this link. That 
is one example. 
  Another example is in the refining and transportation of 
petroleum products. I must say that the existing potential for 
using Georgia's territory for commodity pipelines and the 
transportation of oil and gas -- I have in mind exporting -- is 
a very convenient opportunity for us to reduce transportation 
costs. 
  As far as Georgia's industry is concerned, I must of course 
say that all these conflicts, which have been going on over the 
last few years, have in effect ruined Georgia's economy. The 
plants are at a standstill and so is the transport system. It 
is at present winter in Tbilisi and yet there is no heat in the 
apartments. The provision of electricity for lighting is 
strictly regulated, and so on and so forth. I think that first 
and foremost, of course, we all have to do a lot of work to 
revive all our economic activities. 
  [Peslyak] You spoke of an agreement on road transportation 
cooperation, but the railways also account for a considerable 
proportion of transportation. This concerns Russia's economic 
interests, and the economic security of Georgia, and indeed its 
neighbors. 
  [Soskovets] The head of the Georgian Government's Department 
of Railways has expressed a willingness to become part of the 
system of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Railways. This 
statement was made prior to the visit and our Railways Minister 
Gennadiy Matveyevich Fadeyev is now studying the issue. The 
fact is that a mass of Russian goods passes through the 
territory of Georgia. Therefore, we must not evade the issue, 
but probably it is not possible at present to see how we can 
take part in such a way that we do not become a donor and simply 
say that the Georgian railways will be some department or 
railway like, for instance, the West Siberian Railway or the Far 
Eastern Railway. The Georgian Government has proposed that our 
transport management entity -- our Transport Ministry -- become 
involved, for instance, as a shareholder in the development, 
construction, and extension of the port in the town of Poti. 
There is a also a proposal that Batumi too, is expanded and 
conditions created for the modernization of the oil refinery. 
Another proposal is to build a 150-kilometer section of 
pipeline to develop the transportation of gas to Turkey. 
  [Peslyak] The first deputy prime minister remarked with a 
smile that the Moscow City Government had concluded its own 
agreements, and soon Muscovites will be becoming acquainted, for 
instance, with new examples of Georgian wines and brandies.

  [Text] The presence of Russian troops in the Transcaucasus 
after 1995 is suitable for the Russian and Georgian leadership, 
said the Russian chief negotiator to talks with Georgia, General 
Aleksandr Galkin, while commenting on the protocol on creating 
Russian military bases in Georgia. The document was signed in 
Tbilisi February 3. 
  According to the protocol, by July 1 it is planned to create 
three military bases in Vaziani (30 km to the south of Tbilisi), 
Akhalkalaki, (southern Georgia) and Batumi (Adjaria) on the 
basis of the Russian military contingent in the Transcaucasus. 
  The general believes that besides providing security for 
Russia and the states of the Transcaucasian region, the creation 
of the bases will help stabilize the situation in the region and 
protect the Russian-speaking population. 
  Galkin said that the protocol on creating the bases will be 
in effect for 10 years. Afterwards the agreement may be 
extended or annuled if mutually desired. 
  In February the expert group must take the final decision on 
maintaing military bases and decide on the quantity of the 
personnel and military technology. General Galkin who is the 
chief of the armored troops department, believes that about 100 
Russian tanks will be deployed at the three bases. 
  He has said that the training of officers of the Georgian 
army in Russian military schools and academies will possibly be 
made part of the payment for leasing the territory for the 
military bases. 
  The general is sure that a similar document will be signed 
with Armenia, where Moscow intends to create one military base. 
Preliminary consultations on the issue have already been made. 
Russia also plans to create one military base in Azerbaijan, but 
the issue has not been coordinated yet, said Aleksandr Galkin.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" No. 24 feature] </F>
  [Text] The Russian President's foreign policy adviser 
Dmitriy Ryurikov has described Thursday's [3 February] 
Russian-Georgian summit as a success. "Russia and Georgia are 
historically bound to cooperate with each other in that region, 
they are linked by bonds of long-running friendship and need 
each other," he told Interfax. 
  Ryurikov says that the outline agreement will build up their 
potential to help towards a peaceful solution to the conflicts 
in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It is this move that was long 
awaited both in the Caucasus and Black Sea region as a whole. 
  The presidential adviser denies any threat from Russia's 
commitment to help Georgia set up its own army. Nor will this 
lead to renewed conflicts in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, he says. 
Militarily, said Ryurikov, Russia will prefer to deal with a 
disciplined army rather than separate armed units meddling in 
politics. 
  In his words, Russia is determined to effectively monitor 
the 
process of creating a Georgian army while the Russian military 
are well aware of how responsible is the job facing them. 
  Speaking to local intellectuals in Tbilisi on Thursday, 
Yeltsin said that a balanced, unbiased and well-wishing approach 
to all sides in the conflicts was Moscow's foreign policy 
priority. He said any other approach would be perilous both to 
Russia and other countries. In his words, Russia is prepared to 
offer whatever help is needed to defuse all conflicts in the 
region. 
  On the framework agreement between Moscow and Tbilisi, 
Yeltsin said its ratification would depend on the extent of 
Georgia's drive for a negotiated solution to the confrontation 
in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. He called on Georgian 
intellectuals to play an important role in the regional peace 
process. 
  The Russian leader described the CIS as "a very effective 
instrument for the peoples' rapprochement" and Georgia's entry 
into the Commonwealth as "a sensible move".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- First Deputy Chairman of 
the Russian Government, Oleg Soskovets, described documents on 
cooperation signed by Russia and Georgia to be extremely 
important, saying that the two countries took into account new 
political realities which were formed after the disintegration 
of the former Soviet Union and legalised earlier established 
economic ties. 
  Addressing a meeting with journalists which was held at the 
government building on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment on 
Friday [4 February], Soskovets focused on the Russo-Georgian 
package of trade and economic agreements. Soskovets is deeply 
convinced that both countries seek to find a common approach to 
the development of industrial infrastructure. 
  "Georgian colleagues displayed a particular interest in 
Russian enterprises of the fuel-and-energy sector," Soskovets 
said. He pointed out that a number of Russian joint stock 
societies expressed the readiness to take part in the 
modernisation of oil processing complexes on the territory of 
Georgia. However, Soskovets emphasised that "our relations 
should develop on the basis of parity and mutual advantage". 
  Soskovets did not rule out a possibility of granting a 
credit 
to Georgia worth 20 billion roubles in the near future. He 
pointed out that the Russian side seeks to connect these funds 
with the so-called tied credit. 
  Speaking about the economic situation in Russia, Soskovets, 
who is in charge of issues of the fuel and energy sector, the 
military-industrial complex and industry in general, said that 
the state budget remains one of the most pressing problems 
today. He pointed out that at present, the Russian Government, 
on the one hand, has been holding consultations with ministries 
and state committees on the development of the coordinated 
system of mutual payments between enterprises, and on the other 
hand, seeks to conduct a tough policy of allocating credits to 
different branches of the economy.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts article under the "Topic of the Week" </F>
rubric: "Caucasian Chalk Circle"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia and the signing of 
the series of Russian-Georgian documents were undoubtedly the 
most important event of the week. None of the treaties with the 
former Union republics has probably elicited such conflicting 
and sometimes diametrically opposed assessments inside and 
outside Russia. And these contradictions are based in fact, so 
to speak -- in the supremely equivocal situation in the Caucasus. 
  In his play "The Caucasian Chalk Circle" Brecht used an 
ancient legend allegorically to demonstrate the essence of this 
region's fierce disputes over power and land. A guy over whom 
two women are fighting is placed in a chalk circle. Each of the 
women is asked to take him by the hand and pull him to her. 
Needless to say, the woman who is afraid of hurting the boy 
gives in. The one who loves him more. Regrettably, this wisdom 
is beyond the political forces now operating in the Caucasus. 
In order to possess territory and assert their authority they 
are ready to inflict suffering on thousands and thousands of 
people and literally tear this truly beautiful country to bits. 
  What role should Russia play in the Caucasus, a zone of its 
vital interests (there is no point spelling that out today)? 
Moscow cannot be the judge who settles the fierce conflicts over 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia in accordance with its own ideas of 
justice. But nor can it simply watch the bloody fighting. 
Because the Caucasian republics of Russia itself are already 
directly involved in these conflicts. Because if the coals of 
these conflicts are allowed to continue smoldering, the fire may 
break out with renewed vigor if not today then tomorrow and 
spread to southern areas of Russia. 
  I think that Russia's main vital interest in this region at 
the moment is to ensure peace and stability in the Caucasus. 
And this interest can only be realized by mediating in the 
settlement process and acting as guarantor of the accords to be 
secured. This is no easy matter. It is no coincidence that 
most Western powers are in effect ignoring the calls from 
Georgia for them to act in a similar way. The obvious failure 
of Russian mediation last year ahead of the latest outbreak of 
hostilities culminating in the storming of Sukhumi is convincing 
evidence that this task cannot be accomplished just like that. 
  In my view, one of the reasons for this failure was the fact 
that Moscow was unable to provide the parties to the conflict 
with real incentives to find a political solution. For Georgia 
its treaty with Russia might be just such an incentive. But 
there must be no illusions here. This will only happen if the 
present phase of our relations is cleansed of starry-eyed 
idealism and sentimentality. I was so touched by one Tbilisi 
leader's recent statement to the effect that after a period of 
alienation the two countries have finally looked one another in 
the face. No, the truth is that over the last few years Georgia 
has ostentatiously turned its back on Russia. And it is only 
now, bogged down by conflict, a crime wave, and total economic 
collapse, that it has figuratively speaking looked in the 
mirror. What it saw was so impressive that it had no other 
option than to try to integrate itself within the CIS and 
initiate normal dialogue with Moscow. The truth is that the 
incumbent authorities in Georgia, rent by internal conflict and 
clashes, were incapable of ensuring even the normal working of 
the state. They now see the restoration of their ties with 
Russia as their salvation. And Russia certainly needs Georgia. 
In order to tackle strategic problems -- guarding the CIS 
external border and safeguarding the Russian troops' secure 
legal and economic status. 
  So, Moscow today has every chance of safeguarding its own 
interests in the region. Especially since they coincide, if not 
with the politicians' interests then certainly with the 
interests of the normal people living there. Obviously aid in 
resolving Georgia's economic and military problems should be 
conditional upon Tbilisi's taking a constructive approach to the 
political resolution of the conflicts in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia. If that is clear, the development of Russian-Georgian 
relations will not give rise to suspicion and objections from 
the other parties to the conflicts. In my view, the realization 
that the treaty signed in Tbilisi can only be ratified once a 
political settlement has been secured in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia would be a good incentive for Tbilisi to seek a 
reasonable compromise. 
  Russia's endeavor to provide Abkhazia and South Ossetia with 
the kind of status that would safeguard as far as possible the 
rights and interests of the people living there should act as an 
incentive for the other parties to the conflicts. And there is 
a normal civilized means of attaining this objective. State 
competence can be divided up when a new Georgian Constitution is 
developed. And in that case representatives of Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia should be enlisted to work on this constitution 
unconditionally. 
  Finally, I cannot help but mention military issues. It is 
quite natural for Russia to only provide any aid in creating a 
Georgian army once a real political settlement has been secured. 
This settlement will necessitate wide-ranging peacekeeping 
operations. It is clear that Russia will have to bear the full 
burden here. But all the sides must provide firm guarantees that 
the agreements will be fulfilled. Moreover, pledges to stop the 
activity of those military formations which are jeopardizing the 
security of Russian troops are essential. 
  Today purely opportunistic talk regarding the danger of the 
revival of the "Russian empire" can be heard in Georgia and the 
West. I do not doubt that the rigid formulation of the question 
of Russia's vital interests in the Caucasus gives them fresh 
ammunition. However, I do not think that one should pay 
attention to them now. If they could get by without Russia, 
they would probably do so. If not, then Moscow should set the 
terms. 
  There is obviously an internal aspect to Russia's policy in 
the Caucasus today. In order for this policy to be effective a 
unified concept is needed not only for government departments, 
but also for the government and parliament. This policy needs 
the backing of Russia's regions. Judging by the adverse 
reaction to the treaty with Georgia from most State Duma 
factions and, most importantly, the suspicious reaction from the 
Federation Council, this has not proved possible to achieve. 
  So, Russia itself must decide on its Caucasian policy. There 
is every indication that we have left behind the period of 
theoretical disputes over whether or not the post-Soviet area is 
an area of Russia's vital interests. Clearly it is. Today the 
whole point is what means Russia has at its disposal to 
safeguard these interests. The Caucasus will be a difficult 
test of this concept. And Moscow must also find out if it is 
possible to erase the chalk circle that has been the scene of 
hatred and mutual suspicion.

  [Text] The situation in Abkhazia's Gali region, where 
fighting continued last Saturday [5 February] between Abkhazian 
and Georgian formations, "is under Abkhazia's complete control," 
Deputy Prime Minister of the Abkhazian Government Vladimir 
Mikanba told Interfax on Monday. 
  He announced that on February 7, the Abkhazian army 
continued 
to eliminate Georgia's bandit formations. Some of them have 
been pressed into the mountains, while others have been 
encircled or taken prisoner. Georgia has lost about 60 men near 
the village of Okumi. 
  Mikanba alleged that there had been about 1,500 Georgian 
militants in the Gali Region, who had been given the order to 
seize the Gali region and the city of Ochamchira. 
  He also announced that the Georgian formations located on 
the 
left "Georgian" bank of the Inguri River opened artillery fire 
to support their units stationed in Abkhazia. Abkhazian forces 
did not open fire at the left bank, he said. 
  He denied the reports by the Georgian media about the 
execution of Georgian civilians in the Gali region's village of 
Bagdadi. 
  According to sources in Sukhumi, since September 30, 1993, 
when the Georgian troops had to leave Abkhazia, combat 
operations in its territory have not been as fierce as they are 
now. Abkhazians are using tanks and artillery.

  [Text] Tbilisi February 7 TASS -- The Georgian Government 
made a statement accusing the Abkhazian side that it continues 
shelling population in the Kodorskoye Gorge, "burning down 
villages in the Gali district, killing and terrorising local 
population". 
  The government received information that dozens of people 
were shot down. "In actual fact," the statement says, "Abkhazia 
continues a purposeful policy of genocide and ethnic purge of 
Georgian population in Abkhazia". 
  The document lists six villages in the Gali district, which 
were "destroyed with the use of heavy materiel": Pirveli Gali, 
Konstitutsia, Rechkhi, Tskhira, Namarkalu and Gumurishi. 
  The Georgian Government, the document notes, "remains, as 
before, an advocate of and active participant in a peaceful 
settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. At the same time, it is 
ready to take all measures to protect Georgian citizens now 
staying in a territory occupied by separatists and their 
henchmen".

<F P=106> [Interview with State Council chairman Eduard Shevardnadze </F>
by correspondent Nato Oniani in Tbilisi -- live] 
  [Text] [Oniani] Good morning, friends. We are presenting 
our traditional Monday radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, 
chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of state, 
  Batono Eduard, both you and Mr. Yeltsin gave a high 
appreciation to the signed treaty of friendship, good-neighborly 
relations and cooperation at the news conference last week. 
This is really a large, comprehensive treaty, apparently 
different from all other agreements Georgia has had with other 
countries. Yeltsin said that Russia aspires not only to 
friendly relations with Georgia but also to allianced-based 
relations. Could that probably annoy the West? In addition, the 
military package of the treaty and other documents stipulate 
joint guarding of the Georgian-Turkish border. Also signed was 
a memorandum according to which a drafting group will work out 
principles of transferring Russian troops to military bases. 
Could that mean that we will not have equal relations with all 
countries and that certain special relations have been formed 
with Russia? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. I would like to add 
to what I said at our joint news conference and in my other 
speeches that all the agreements, I mean the major treaty and 
the package of all other agreements we signed, represent a 
balance of interests of both countries. We have long been 
looking for this balance. Work has been carried on for almost 
two years. The well-known Paragraph 3 of the treaty and its 
part stating certain responsibilities and commitments Russia is 
undertaking in connection with building Georgia's Armed Forces 
was included in the treaty at the last stage only. This 
demonstrates that during the last two years we were busy 
thinking about the treaty and wanted to have every word and 
phrase weighed and selected so that it could endure the test of 
time. 
  Of course all depends on how this agreement is implemented. 
This will depend on the two parties and on processes which 
develop within the two countries. 
  Now a little more detail in connection with guarding the 
border. First, I have to remind you that we are guarding the 
border jointly at present, too. Or rather, mainly Russian 
border forces are guarding the border at present. Our frontier 
troops are not able to guard the border independently, 
unfortunately. There is neither a material or financial basis 
for this, nor appropriate personnel. You should be aware that a 
border is technically rather a complex object. It is not easy 
to maintain it. This is connected with professions and it will 
apparently take several years to acquire the skills. 
  We speak of friendly and fraternal relations with Turkish 
leaders. I believe we will build such relations with this big 
neighbor of ours. In future, there will probably be no 
necessity to guard the border. You were in Turkey when Mr. 
Demirel said that we have such fraternal relations that in time 
the border could became symbolic. I agree with him. But, at 
the moment, the elimination of the border will cause big 
problems for both countries. 
  A mechanism for annullment has also been included in the 
treaty. 
  We shall create our own border forces. This will probably 
take several years. Then time will show and we will make a 
decision as convenient and necessary for our own interests and 
the interests of our neighbors. 
  Second, the presence of the Russian troops in Georgia and 
Caucasia is a fact. Not only in Georgia but in Armenia, in 
particular. As far as I know, Azerbaijan has a similar approach 
to the settlement of the issue, I mean the principle of military 
bases. Speaking of Georgia, we mean a new statute and there 
really is a compromise. We have found a compromise. The 
statute of the troops will be founded on the principle of 
military bases. It will happen in the future because, to be 
more precise, there is no agreement yet. This is a memorandum 
about our recognizing the principle and wishing to create an 
operative group which will work out the issue and get the text 
of the agreement ready. 
  Now, where is the compromise? Russia is interested in 
remaining here on the principles of military bases because we 
cannot speak of creating a stable infrastructure in one or two 
years. When we speak of bases, we mean a long stay. No country 
can be happy at allowing other country's troop to enter its 
territory. But we can see Russia's interest on one hand and, on 
the other hand, we have to create an army, a real army. The 
other side of the compromise speaks in our favor and it will be 
reflected in the agreement stating detailed commitments and 
measures Russia will have to take to have our army created. 
Today we possess nothing of our own. We have no arms, no heavy 
equipment, medium and light equipment, no ammunition, nothing. 
We failed to get arms even for the police from anywhere. 
  [Oniani] There seemed to be certain promises in the past. 
  [Shevardnadze] We were promised but...[pauses] let us think. 
If a country can exist without an army we would not make that 
decision. But an army is apparently a necessity. If a country 
can exist without the police we would ask the Russians to quit 
and no talks about any bases would take place. But at present 
normal formation and functioning of the police and interior 
ministry troops depend on arms, a technical basis and finances, 
if you will. 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, sorry to interrupt you but I 
remember 
that having returned from Turkey you said at the Tbilisi 
conference of the Union of Citizens that Georgia will really 
have its own army which will fight to the last drop of blood for 
the country and will protect the country's interests. Did you 
mean that? Did you mean that there would be assistance in 
building troops? 
  [Shevardnadze] You know, Turkey, despite the fact that it is 
rendering immense help to us with credits and other supporting 
actions, cannot provide arms. 
  [Oniani] Was it known then that we would transfer to the 
system of bases and Russia would help us? 
  [Shevardnadze] Of course it was meant at that time. Along 
with these factors, the compromise has to be expressed in 
another thing. Russia and its armed forces should play an 
active and positive role in the settlement of the Abkhazian 
issue and in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. Only if 
we see that this positive role is guaranteed, only then shall we 
sign an agreement. 
  Now, will this complicate our relations with other 
countries? 
I believe that politicians and analysts of other countries 
interested in Russia's policy in Caucasia and in Russia's policy 
in general are scrutinizing all this. I do not think this could 
cause any serious complications. 
  Turkey could be the most sensitive toward this issue. But I 
already informed Mr. Demirel yesterday, I wrote to him what we 
had in mind when signing the agreement. Turkey as well as 
Russia is most of all interested in a stable Caucasia and a 
stable Georgia. And the guarantees which secure this stability 
will be welcomed with understanding by our neighbor Turkey, 
other neighbors and other countries. So, I do not think that 
this could have an adverse effect on our relations with other 
countries. 
  [Oniani] I would like to remind you of a few phrases said 
by Yeltsin during his visit: There are forces in our country who 
want to restore Moscow's role, to restore the empire within its 
former borders. This tendency is dangerous primarily for Russia 
itself. 
  You have expressed a hope that the treaty will not have a 
fate similar to the two previous ones, meaning the Tractate 
[signed between the East Georgian Kingdom and the Russian Empire 
in 1784] and that of 7 May 1920 [between the independent 
Republic of Georgia and Bolshevik Russia] and it will not be 
violated unilaterally. You have also said that Yeltsin is the 
only person who properly understands Russia's strategic interest 
which implies having a stable and friendly neighbor in the 
south. In principle, stability is the target Georgia has been 
striving for for a long time. It can be said that Russia has 
already specified its interest in relation with Georgia. How 
reliable are these interests if Russia is not stable itself? 
Does it imply that the stability of the two countries is of 
mutual interest for our countries? 
  [Shevardnadze] I highly appreciate what Yeltsin said in 
Georgia. Along with the phrases you remembered so well, I would 
like to draw your attention to yet another phrase. I regard his 
speech in the Academy of Sciences as a very important one, a 
landmark in Russian-Georgian relations. There was a phrase like 
this: Russia is not relieving itself of responsibilities for the 
fact that agreements on the settlement the Abkhazian conflict 
failed. He admits it. You have to be a courageous and honest 
man to say this. One thing is that we said something and we 
complained but the other thing is that the president himself 
said it. In fact, he said many significant things during his 
stay here. 
  Now, has Russia defined its strategic goals in Caucasia in 
general and in Georgia in particular? Speaking of the president 
and his policy and his understanding of Russo-Georgian relations 
in the long run, I think that the president has this issue well 
understood. At least, our conversations and his speeches 
differed from those at previous meetings. I saw that he really 
understood this. 
  He persistently stated in his conversations that he 
interprets Russia's strategic interests in Georgia's being 
united and integral, strong and friendly toward Russia. I see 
this in the same way. However Russia's fate develops in future 
and however complicated the internal relations between various 
forces and regions become, I believe that friendly relations 
with Russia are a better shield than confrontation. Even if 
imperial forces, as we call them, come to power in Russia. In 
any case, we took a proper step and we did what we had to do. I 
have no doubt at all that the majority of our population 
expected the same from the visit and assessed the results in the 
same way. If I did not have a deep conviction that 70 or 75 
percent of the Georgian population interpreted Russian-Georgian 
relations the same way as I did I would not have signed these 
documents. Seventy percent and probably even a little more. 
  [Oniani] After Yeltsin's visit you said that if we had had 
this treaty a year ago the Abkhazian conflict would have been 
over. Last week, UN Security Council resolution No. 896 was 
made public. Abkhazian issues will again be discussed on 8 
February. Information has been spread that the treaty will not 
be ratified until the Abkhazian issue is settled. What is your 
assessment? What did this treaty bring into the problem of the 
settlement of the Abkhazian issue? 
  [Shevardnadze] When I said that had we had the treaty a year 
ago Abkhazia would not have been lost I meant that Russia would 
have also avoided a lot of troubles. Russia gained nothing at 
all from the fact that Georgia lost Abkhazia temporarily. On 
the contrary, it found far more difficulties near its southern 
borders in North Caucasia in particular and in the country in 
general. Russia found certain difficulties on the international 
arena, too. The international opinion about Georgia is quite 
sensible and quite objective. 
  When I said that had we had this treaty ready a year ago 
Abkhazia would not have been lost and we would have avoided lots 
of troubles, I said this and I am saying it now for the 
attention of the forces which even now continue the traditions 
of that old Supreme Council. I am really sorry that they cannot 
understand that friendly relations, normal relations between two 
countries are a guarantee for the settlement of conflicts. If 
we do not trust each other, I mean Georgia and Russia, how can 
any issue be settled without Russia's participation? This 
atmosphere of distrust brought us to the disaster linked with 
Abkhazia. All these 200,000 refugees, so many lost lives and 
other misfortunes are the cost of this. 
  [Oniani] There was a statement by the forces you have just 
mentioned that if Sukhumi were lost and Abkhaz forces occupied 
Sukhumi the world would see with whose participation it happened 
and the world would take our side and return Abkhazia to us. 
Not only Sukhumi but virtually whole of Abkhazia has been lost. 
  [Shevardnadze] I would like to say that I meant forces in 
Russia, too. They criticize Yeltsin for signing the treaty. I 
speak more to the attention of those forces. Indeed, I speak to 
the attention of our partners and opponents, too, but 
particularly to the attention of those forces who state their 
fundamental position and criticize the president for signing 
this treaty. I reiterate that Georgia has lost much but Russia 
has gained nothing. This senseless confrontation must by all 
means come to an end. And I think that a foundation has been 
laid for this. 
  Now, about Russia's role in the settlement of the Abkhazian 
conflict. This role is in close contact with active 
participation of the United Nations and European security 
structures. This is very important now. The use of 
international forces in its classic form is not ruled out 
despite the negotiations Yeltsin and I held and despite Russia's 
readiness to take the most of the commitment on itself. It is 
not ruled out but I am not very convinced that the Security 
Council will take a decision of this sort. 
  [Oniani] Does it mean that international forces should enter 
the territory with various countries having a definite role, and 
not only Russia? 
  [Shevardnadze] There is such a possibility. However, the 
main factor of the settlement is Russia, anyway. We do not have 
to be afraid to state this. I believe that this emphasizes not 
only Russia's role but its commitments. The visit provided us 
with certain guarantees. At least the president's public 
statements and what he told me during our private meeting can be 
considered as a guarantee. Now the main thing is how quickly 
will there be a settlement of all problems, including and 
apparently primarily the issue of refugees. Tomorrow 
negotiations on the statute of Abkhazia are beginning and we 
believe that the issue of the return of refugees should be 
submitted once again and the process has to be sped up. 
  [Oniani] During your meeting with Yeltsin you presented your 
own model of the settlement of Caucasian conflicts. It was 
three plus one, that is three Caucasian states plus Russia with 
its North Caucasian subjects. North Caucasian republics have 
been against the treaty from the very beginning and joined the 
camp of the opponents of the ratification. Obviously, Russia 
has to consider this but Russia has to consider Georgia, too 
because, as you have said, a disintegrated country in the south 
next to North Caucasia cannot meet Russia's interest. What does 
the Caucasian factor mean for Russia, for Caucasia and who will 
manage this process? 
  [Shevardnadze] The Caucasian factor is one of the guarantees 
for the stability of huge areas and vital centers in the south 
of Russia's territory. Not the only one but a very important 
one. An unstable Georgia is not acceptable for Russia's 
national interests. If there are considerations and actions in 
conformity with the law, Russian politicians should understand 
this in this way and I believe that the Russian president 
understands it in this way. 
  As for starting the mechanism, this needs time. The peoples 
of North Caucasia will be interested in a Caucasian dialogue. I 
am positive about that. They are not probably ripen for it 
today. Let us wait till tomorrow. Some time is needed. And I 
think that this is not very far off. I have publicly said that 
the Azeri president, the Armenian president, and President 
Yeltsin had a positive response to this idea of three plus one, 
or maybe one plus three, and I believe that it has far-reaching 
prospects. 
  [Oniani] And yet another issue which could be considered as 
important. We have been refused the right to join the ruble zone 
for the time being, although there has been a fear in Georgia 
that we would be dragged into the zone by force. How important 
are those economic acts stipulated by the agreements? 
  [Shevardnadze] Measures and agreements included in the 
treaty 
do not imply imply our joining the ruble zone. As for the issue 
by itself, they have neither refused nor agreed to it. We have 
not insisted on it, either. The issue is so significant that it 
cannot be solved overnight. The principal thing is whether we 
will be able to strengthen the coupon, to vitalize our economy. 
Economic agreements signed in Tbilisi as well in Moscow can be 
considered as preconditions to this. If we find that we are able 
to strengthen the coupon there will be no need to speak of the 
possibilities of joining the ruble zone. 
  Important measures have been planned for this week. These 
include an assessment of the results of the last year, plans and 
targets for the current year, discussion of a program of 
surviving the crisis -- but the main issue is strengthening the 
coupon. We shall consider and discuss this issue at every level, 
at the government level, with my participation, without my 
participation. Then parliament will take up the issue and in a 
certain time we may be able to give a definite answer to the 
question whether we need the ruble zone. 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, yet another explosion resulted in 
the 
killing of Deputy Defense Minister Nikoloz Kekelidze in Tbilisi 
last week. The idea is circulating that some state or 
government structures were involved in this incident to some 
extent. First, could you please comment on this. And another 
question. The mass media reported the resignation of Defense 
Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili. Have you any information for us 
on this issue? 
  [Shevardnadze] As for the death of Mr. Kekelidae, it is most 
deplorable. I was rather distressed. Similarly deplorable was 
an assassination in Rustavi a week ago, as well as the brutal 
killing of two police officers in Tbilisi the other day. As you 
know, the killing of Kekelidze coincided with the date of the 
Yeltsin's visit. It happened at 0330 and the visit was beginning 
in the morning. 
  But I do not think that any state structure, even if there 
is 
a bandit terrorist group in it, would time this horrible crime 
to coincide with a crucial day like this. I have read a 
statement by one of the parties mentioning state terrorism and 
implying that we could be dealing with the state terrorism. 
Speaking of state terrorism and somehow linking this event with 
it is to my mind a very worrying fact in itself. A politician 
who admits the possibility of the state's involvement in 
terrorist acts so easily, is probably not far from 
implementation of an idea like this if we permit him to manage 
any state structure -- or if the people elect him to manage a 
state structure. I cannot simply bear the thought that the 
state has chosen the path of terrorism in Georgia today. Whoever 
assumes such a possibility may be brooding over this idea 
himself. 
  As for Karkarashvili's resignation, I could not see him and 
I 
will meet him soon. His resignation letter is rather 
categorical and I do not think that it was written rashly 
because the demand to let him resign is so categorically stated. 
I have not made any decision yet. We shall meet in two or 
three days and the final decision will of course be made public. 
  [Oniani] And finally another question. I would like to 
return to Yeltsin's visit. The ceremony of meeting him and other 
matters were organized in such a normal way that we experienced 
a feeling of a sort of statehood. We felt that we were citizens 
of a state. Tomorrow, 8 February, we celebrate the memorial day 
of Davit Aghmashenebeli [12th Century Georgian king], a Georgian 
king to whom the idea of Georgia's statehood is linked. During 
your meeting with Kutaisi citizens yesterday you said that a new 
stage of the national movement was beginning, a new era which 
could be called an era of commitments, commitments to one's own 
country because this is your state and it does not belong to 
someone else. Youth has a special role in this. 
  Finally, restoration work is being carried out at the shrine 
to Bagrati [first Georgian king to unite Georgia in 11th 
Century] in Kutaisi, which can be considered a symbol of the 
unity of the Georgian people. Do you think Bagrati will become a 
real symbol of unity or it will remain a mere symbol? 
  [Shevardnadze] You are right. The reception of a high level 
visitor like Yeltsin is not easy for the country in such a 
disastrous situation. This is linked with lots and lots of 
factors. As we saw Mr. Yeltsin off and the plane took off I told 
one of my colleagues that we were beginning to resemble a state. 
It really meant a lot. 
  I met with citizens of Kutaisi yesterday. You could see some 
people from Tbilisi, too, but there were mostly visitors from 
Kutaisi headed by Kutaisi Mayor Temur Shashiashvili. And I 
really spoke of a new stage of national commitments. What is 
being done in Kutaisi can be considered as one of the links in 
this. I am aware that a lot is being done in Tbilisi, in Ajaria, 
in other regions. But this is a Kutaisi citizens' initiative. I 
have welcomed this initiative. It is a magnificent initiative. 
The Bagrati temple and the name of Bagrati should be connected 
with the struggle for unity, not merely symbolically but truly 
and meaningfully. It should give an impetus to a new stage of a 
new real national movement for the unity of Georgia. 
  There is a proposal to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of 
integrated Georgia next year and I fully support the idea. I 
think that if we manage it adequately it will mean the return to 
the path taken by Bagrat and the great Davit -- not in words and 
only at anniversary times and not with loud festivities. We 
have to move forward and build, following in their footsteps. 
We have to move along the road of building and not of 
destruction. This is the road we have to take. I understand 
this in this way. If I have the tiniest chance I will visit 
Gelati [monastery in Kutaisi where King Davit is buried] and 
kneel before Davit the Builder's tomb, not because I want to 
connect it with a sort of populism but to appeal to my people 
that we have to advance together along the road of building and 
that it was not by accident that our people gave great Davit the 
name of Builder.

  [Text] Tbilisi, February 4 (SNARK)--At the meeting with the 
leadership of the Russian Defence Department the representatives 
of the Georgian delegation put a question on additional 
redistribution to Georgia the additional content of Russian 
troops within the intermediary mission, Colonel Pavel Flyagin 
[name as received], the expert of the Transcaucasia Ethnic 
Relations of the Russian Defence Department, told SNARK.

  [Text] Most Georgians support concluding the 
Russian-Georgian treaty on friendship, cooperation and 
good-neighborly relations signed by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze in Tbilisi 
yesterday. 
  According to an opinion poll conducted by the sociological 
service of the Georgian agency BS-Press, a total of 91% of 
respondents support signing the treaty, while only 4% 
said they 
do not. Five percent of those asked abstained from answering 
the question. 
  A total of 73.4% of Georgians believe that the 
treaty will 
play an important part in the settlement of the armed conflict 
in Abkhazia, while 11.9% were skeptical about that and 
another 
14.7% found it difficult to answer. 
  As many as 59% of those asked believe that deploying 
Russian 
troops in Georgia on Russian conditions (3 military bases in the 
republic) is in Georgia's interests, while 19.2% are 
categorically against the deployment. Another 21.8% said 
they 
were too incompetent in such issues to provide any answer. 
  During the poll, 10 out of 500 said this was the first that 
they had heard that Yeltsin had visited Georgia.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has described as 
historic the visit to Tbilisi February 3 by Russian President 
Yeltsin. 
  Addressing in Tbilisi Friday the conference of the Union of 
Georgian Citizens, he said that the signed agreements would 
provide results shortly. 
  Shevardnadze called groundless the fears by certain forces 
in 
Russia and Georgia that the treaty of friendship and cooperation 
between the two countries may destabilize the situation in the 
North Caucasus. The Georgian leader said that the treaty had 
been signed for a ten year period, and if one of the sides did 
not demand its annulment, it would be extended automatically. 
  Speaking about the possible creation in Georgia of Russian 
military bases, Shevardnadze said that the problem was not yet 
solved. At the talks, he said, the two sides only agreed on 
forming expert teams to consider the problem. 
  Answering the question on circumstances behind the death 
Thursday in Tbilisi of deputy Georgian Defense Minister Niko 
Kekelidze, the Georgian leader said that the act of terrorism 
(Kekelidze died following an explosion in his house) was not 
committed for political reasons. Organized crime is behind the 
murder. 
  Speaking about the resignation of Georgian Defense Minister 
Georgiy Karkarashvili, Shevardnadze said that he would meet him 
and ask him to explain the reasons.

  [Text] The reaction in political circles and among the 
population in Georgia to Boris Yeltsin's visit to the republic 
is not unequivocal. However, most politicians and inhabitants 
of Georgia assess positively the signing of the bilateral treaty 
with Russia. 
  The Department for Sociological Studies at the Georgian 
Academy of Sciences and also leading republic's newspapers have 
published the results of the sociological poll of the population 
following the Russian president's visit to Georgia. 
  According to the poll results, 67 percent of respondents 
assess positively the normalization of Russian-Georgian 
relations; 10 percent of those polled view the visit by the 
Russian delegation negatively. As for the rest, they find it 
difficult to define their position. 
  At the same time, 90 percent of respondents believe the 
establishment of good-neighborly relations with Russia is in 
Georgia's state interests.

<F P=106> [Tengiz Pachkoriya report under the "Georgia" rubric: </F>
"Question of Russian Military Bases Resolved. Peacekeeping Will 
Cost Moscow a Lot"] 
  [Excerpt] As reported, during Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's official visit to Georgia, representatives of the 
Russian and Georgian sides signed the agreement "On the Status 
and Conditions of Functioning of the Russian Federation Border 
Troops Staying on the Territory of the Republic of Georgia." 
Pavel Grachev said in an interview to Georgian journalists that 
a protocol of intention concerning Russian bases in Georgia was 
also signed during the visit. In his words, it is planned to 
set up three bases: in Tbilisi (in the Vaziani area), 
Akhalkalaki, and Batumi. The Batumi military base, Grachev 
said, would have branches in Poti, Sukhumi, and Gudauta. The 
bases will rely only on the Russian troop units in the 
Transcaucasus that are currently deployed in the areas. Pavel 
Grachev's last statement refutes recent rumors that Russian 
military units leaving Germany will allegedly be moved to 
Abkhazia and other Georgian regions. According to Grachev, 
warships of the Black Sea Fleet are planned to be stationed in 
the Poti area. All the bases will be set up by 1 July 1994. 
  In his interview for the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA newspaper, which 
was published 4 February, Pavel Grachev said with regard to the 
military bases' objectives: "The objectives of these military 
bases are to ensure the security of Russia and the states of the 
Transcaucasus region that are parties to the Collective Security 
treaty. When asked whether the question of border troops was 
resolved, Pavel Grachev noted that the existing border between 
Georgia and Russia will not be moved. Regarding the 
resubordination of Russian troops deployed in Abkhazia to 
General Reut, commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the 
Transcaucasus, the Russian defense minister remarked that all 
troops staying in Georgia are subordinated to Reut except for 
the 345th Airborne Regiment, which, according to Grachev, is a 
regiment subordinate directly to the Russian defense minister 
and remains his strategic reserve. Answering a question by 
SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA's correspondent about to whom the Russian 
troops that will serve as peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia will 
be subordinated and who will finance them, the defense minister 
said: "These troops are under the command of Colonel General 
Georgiy Kondratyev. As for financing, this is a painful 
question. We still do not have a UN Security Council mandate 
for Russian troops to carry out peacekeeping missions in the 
former USSR countries, for them to be peacekeepers under UN 
aegis. This is why they do not pay us and we have to bear all 
the costs on our own. Nonetheless we do not give up our 
mission, seeing Georgia as a single body." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Recently, the Georgian minister of agriculture and 
food production and the Turkish minister of agriculture and 
rural affairs signed a protocol on technical, scientific, and 
economic cooperation between the two ministries in Ankara. It 
contains four paragraphs and stipulates the extension of 
cooperation in the spheres of agriculture, food production, 
cattle-breeding, and fisheries. Our correspondent Dilar 
Jvebenava has been told at the ministry that Turkish experts are 
expected to visit in the very near future and will carry out 
research of conditions for cooperation. This will be followed 
by a return visit by our delegation. Thus, partnership with a 
neighbor is useful, especially with Turkey as a wealthy, 
politically stable, and economically strong country, which is in 
line with European standards and where the Georgian diaspora is 
best represented.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 5 Feb -- More than 300 Ukrainian servicemen 
attempted on Friday to seize the territory of a military unit of 
the Black Sea Fleet in Nikolayev (southern Ukraine). Around 10 
of them were armed with automatic weapons, an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was informed by phone today by the fleet's press 
center. Only restraint on the part of the command of the 
brigade of ships under construction and of a hospital, which the 
attackers penetrated, prevented a more serious incident from 
occurring. 
  It says the Ukrainian side regarded as justification for 
these actions the fact that three officers and five warrant 
officers of the hospital base submitted applications with a 
request to serve in the Ukrainian Navy. At the same time, these 
Black Sea servicemen intend to move under the jurisdiction of 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry together with material resources, 
equipment, and weapons. 
  "The position of the Black Sea Command remains invariable: 
we 
are not going to impede those who want to serve in the Ukrainian 
Navy," an ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the fleet's press 
center. 
  However, all units, bases, ships and other military 
installations belonging to the fleet remain under the 
jurisdiction of the Black Sea Fleet command, as follows from the 
Yalta agreement signed by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine. 
Only the signatures of the two presidents can authorize any 
actions with regard to the fleet. 
  The press center voiced its regret that the unwillingness to 
understand this undermined the authority of the representatives 
of the command of the Ukrainian Navy who have been lately 
talking with increasing frequency about their desire to conduct 
a dialogue with the fleet's command.

  [Text] Kiev, 4 Feb -- Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko spoke at a news conference in the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry on the attitude of the world community to the 
trilateral agreement on nuclear disarmament signed in Moscow. 
This attitude, he said, was absolutely positive, showing the 
world community's appreciation of the historic step taken by 
Ukraine. The minister noted that the resolution adopted by the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine yesterday [3 February] was especially 
significant, in that the Supreme Council appreciated the steps 
made by the president and the government to follow the Supreme 
Council's recommendations contained in the 18 November 1993 
resolution. 
  "It is worth stressing," Anatoliy Zlenko said, "that the 
Supreme Council, having withdrawn its reservations on Article 5 
of the Lisbon Protocol, thus confirmed Ukraine's intention to 
join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as soon as 
possible, as a state that does not possess nuclear arms. This 
way, failure to make a decision on joining the NPT should not be 
regarded as the Supreme Council's negative stand on the treaty, 
but only as the Supreme Council's intention to examine this 
issue at a separate Supreme Council session." 
  The minister then said that the Supreme Council's decision 
clears the way for exchanging instruments of ratification and 
thus completing the process of the ratification of the START 
Treaty. 
  Anatoliy Zlenko told journalists that bilateral and 
trilateral talks between experts will be held in the near future 
with regard to the practical implementation of the principles 
laid down in the trilateral statement and its appendix signed on 
14 January in Moscow. In the minister's view, the Supreme 
Council's decision makes it possible to speed up talks with 
international financial organizations, the European Union, and 
the leading Western states on the granting of effective aid to 
Ukraine for its economic reform. 
  In reply to journalists' questions, the foreign minister 
said 
that only three nuclear warheads had been transferred from 
Ukraine to Russia so far, due to their unsatisfactory technical 
condition.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report under the "Crimea" rubric: "`Yuriy </F>
Meshkov's Policy Is Aimed at Confrontation,' Says Mustafa 
Dzhemilev, Chairman of Crimean Tatar People's Assembly"] 
  [Text] Yuriy Meshkov's statement at his first news 
conference as president of the Republic of Crimea, that the 
Crimean Tatar People's Assembly should legalize its status (that 
is, register as a party), otherwise it will be outlawed because 
there cannot be two legislatures, has worried the deported 
people. Speaking on an evening program of Crimean television, 
Assembly Chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev said: "We have repeatedly 
emphasized that the Crimean Tatars do not recognize the 
institution of the presidency as set forth in the Crimean Law on 
the President of the Republic of Crimea." All the more so, 
Dzhemilev noted, because while adopting the law the Crimean 
parliament "completely ignored the rights of the Crimean Tatar 
people -- it dismissed without consideration the draft law On 
the President of the Crimean Republic." The Crimean Tatars 
nonetheless decided to take part in the presidential elections 
in order "to preserve peace and tranquillity in Crimea." 
  Mustafa Dzhemilev recalled that the Crimean Tatars voted 
against Yuriy Meshkov and said that "any recognition of Meshkov 
as president is out of the question." The Crimean Tatar leader 
said further that everyone can see how often Yuriy Meshkov has 
changed his views: "What filthy epithets he used when speaking 
about Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, but now he calls him 
an outstanding politician of our time." The nonrecognition does 
not mean, however, Dzhemilev pointed out, that we will 
completely ignore the president. If Meshkov approaches our 
problems sensibly, we will support him, but, "unfortunately, his 
policy is aimed at confrontation." 
  The Crimean Tatar leader said that the Assembly will convene 
on 19 February: "Some events are going to happen in the 
meantime, and we will definitely determine our stance on the 
Crimean presidency and personally on Meshkov." Mustafa 
Dzhemilev called Yuriy Meshkov's demands that the Assembly be 
registered as groundless and absurd. "This will never happen. 
We are in for yet another spiral of confrontation," Dzhemilev 
concluded.

  [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan states its intention to carry out in 1994 in a 
consistent and targeted way the economic policy directed at the 
stabilization of macroeconomic processes and acceleration of 
systemic changes to form the open and effective social market 
economy. 
  The government will channel its main efforts at curbing the 
inflation, stability of the payment balance, strengthening of 
the national currency, decrease of the rates of the production 
decline, and maintenance of the living standards of the 
population. 
  The year 1994 will become one of the most trying years in 
the 
development of the country's economy. However, there are all 
conditions and possibilities for this year to become the last 
year of the deepening crisis. The government will take all 
measures to resolve this problem. 
<H5>  Financial and Crediting Policy </H5>
<H5>  The national currency </H5>
  Since the introduction of the national currency the 
government together with the national bank have introduced a 
strict financial and crediting policy aimed at reducing the rate 
of inflation. 
  1. To increase the role of interest rates, the national bank 
in the fourth quarter of 1994 will increase the credit resources 
share granted by the bank via tenders up to 75 percent. The 
maximum time period of newly granted loans, with the exception 
of seasonal productions, will be reduced from a year to nine 
months and later to six months. The practice of their 
prolongation will be discontinued from mid-1994. The interest 
rate of the national bank will be levelled with market rates. 
The national bank will cease granting loans with interest rates 
lower than its official interest rate. 
  2. The government intends to create all necessary 
conditions to arrange sales of state securities. 
  3. The government is currently elaborating methods of 
tackling the problems of debts between enterprises and 
inoperative bank assets. To improve the system of settlement of 
payments, the national bank will levy late charges from banks 
for the delay in crediting customers' accounts. To strengthen 
confidence in the national currency, gradually the restrictions 
or limitations with regard of the use of cash will be lifted. 
  4. The government together with the national bank will 
pursue the policy that does not allow sharp fluctuations of the 
exchange rate. 
  5. The government will take measures to transfer into the 
country all hard currency revenues earned by exporting 
enterprises to sell the currency at tradings held by the 
national bank. 
<H5>  Policy in pricing </H5>
  1. Regulated prices will be preserved in 1994 for bread and 
bakery products, millet, semolina, combined fodders, and flour 
sold instead of baked bread. 
  2. The government will lift a temporary restriction on 
the profitability norm for all enterprises regardless of their 
situation on the market, with the exception of several 
specialized monopolist enterprises. 
  3. The government will not take steps that will obstruct 
the increase of prices for fuel up to the world level. The 
domestic price for crude oil will be gradually increased during 
the year. 
<H5>  The budget policy </H5>
  1. In 1994 the limit of the state budget deficit will be set 
within the limit of 4 percent of the gross domestic product 
[GDP]. The government will take all possible measures to cover 
the state budget deficit at the expense of the noninflationary 
sources, mainly by selling the state securities and involvement 
of foreign sources of financing. 
  2. The government intends to submit for the examination 
by the Supreme Kenges proposals concerning futher improvement of 
the taxation system including abolition and reduction of various 
tax holidays and allowances. The work will be continued to 
strengthen the tax inspectorate and customs service. 
  3. The government together with the national bank will 
cease granting soft loans. 
  4. The government will take measures to set up a treasury 
under the Ministry of Finance the main functions of which will 
be cash regulation of the state budget, management of financial 
resources of the government and local executive bodies as well 
as of the state debt. 
<H5>  Measures of social protection </H5>
  1. The government continuing the policy of social support of 
the population will change the current system and introduce 
personalized social allowances system. 
  2. A system of social guarantees will be elaborated. It 
will consist of two levels -- a republican and a local level. 
Every citizen of the republic will be entitled to a certain 
amount of assistance at the republican level, and at the local 
level additional assistance will be provided depending on the 
circumstances. 
  3. The government will restructure the current pension 
scheme and reform the social insurance fund system, the pension 
fund, and the fund of promoting employment. 
  4. The minimum wages will be re-examined after the 
abolition of all regulated prices for consumer goods and 
services. The government will aim at balancing the ratio 
between the wages and rate of production growth. 
  5. Legal and economic conditions will be created to 
involve the able-bodied population in economic activity. The 
program for development of private entrepreneurship will be 
adopted to increase the goods production and employment of the 
population. 
<H5>  Policy in the foreign sector </H5>
  1. The government will make every effort to encourage 
exports with the aim of overcoming the slump in production and 
improving the balance of payments. There will be a reduction in 
the range of export quotas and licenses. As a result, licensing 
of exports will be carried out only with the purpose of 
observing the rules of currency exchange, prevention of export 
dumping, ensuring timely payment of taxes, in the interests of 
national and international security, and also to preserve the 
cultural and artistic heritage. 
  2. The government will undertake all steps to eliminate 
hindrances in foreign trade. It will strengthen coordination of 
measures to free prices with other states and join their efforts 
directed at improving clearing settlements in inter-state trade. 
  3. All operations with foreign investments will be 
carried out at a single exchange rate. The government will put 
on the table for consideration by the Supreme Soviet proposals 
on establishing a single procedure for registration and taxation 
for enterprises with foreign participation and national 
enterprises. The national agency for foreign investments will 
become the center for gathering and providing information on 
rules and the potential of foreign investments. 
  4. The balance of payments in 1994 will remain tense, and 
there will continue to be a deficit in trade with the countries 
of the former USSR. Despite the inflow of investments for 
financing this deficit, in the short term there will need to be 
additional external financial help. In attracting foreign loans 
the government will adhere to a restrained and balanced policy. 
The Ministry of Finance will be the only body authorized on 
behalf of the government to conclude agreements on external 
loans or to provide guarantees. 
<H5>  Systemic transformations </H5>
  1. The program of privatization in all three directions will 
be continued. 
  Small-scale privatization will basically see the completion 
of privatization of businesses in the wholesale and retail 
trade, public catering, consumer and other services, and also 
structures linked to them which provide the carriage, storage, 
and sales of output. 
  In the framework of mass-scale privatization the 
distribution 
of privatization investment coupons to the population will be 
completed and coupon auctions will be held. 
  In individual schemes it is planned to sell off a number of 
large and unique enterprises. 
  2. The government considers that until state enterprises 
are privatized, it has the responsibility of running them. In 
1994 there will be a reappraisal of the basic funds of 
enterprises. 
  3. On the basis of national programs the government will 
take measures to develop priority sectors of the economy. 
  4. The system of state needs will be of a temporary 
nature. It will be replaced by a market-oriented system of 
state purchases based on the principle of freely concluded 
contracts and taking consideration of exclusively state 
requirements (hospitals, state administration bodies, education, 
and defense). 
  5. The government will focus special attention on 
eliminating monopolies in the sphere of the wholesale trade and 
transport and sales services connected with it, and also in the 
sphere of foreign trade. 
  6. The government will undertake all measures to fulfill 
the set aims, creating the due monitoring mechanisms for this. 
  In the framework of the declared economic policy the 
government is open to discussion of constructive ideas and 
proposals, and is ready to cooperate on this platform with all 
socio-political movements.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Security-Internal Affairs </F>
Ministry To Be Set Up"] 
  [Text] According to reports received by MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS from reliable sources, the presidential 
administration is preparing yet another reform of special 
services. This time it will be about setting up, not 
dissolving, a structure that would take over all state security 
units and law-enforcement agencies. 
  It is planned to organize "a security service community" 
that 
would include chiefs of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, 
the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Agency of 
Government Communications and Information, the Main Security 
Administration, the presidential security service (all former 
KGB services), and also the Main Intelligence Administration of 
the Defense Ministry General Staff. In addition, the community 
will include chiefs of services to be set up on the basis of the 
reorganized Internal Affairs Ministry. It is not yet clear who 
will head the new structure. To all appearances, it will be 
subordinate directly to the president, and its meetings will be 
chaired either by the Russian Federation Security Council's 
secretary or by the president's national security adviser.
