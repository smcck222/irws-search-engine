<F P=106> [News conference held by President Geydar Aliyev with </F>
Turkish reporters in Baku on 3 February; reporters' questions 
are in Turkish, Aliyev's replies in Azeri -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Aliyev, in progress] ...there are friendly and 
fraternal relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan. The 
friendship and fraternity between our peoples have a long and 
rich history and these ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan have 
been considerably broadened and developed. However, this does 
not mean that the level of relations completely satisfies Turkey 
and Azerbaijan. There is a great potential to deepen and 
further develop our relations. I believe that these potentials 
have thus far not been used to the desired extent. Therefore, 
many tasks await us now and in the future. I repeat that our 
relations are ones of friendship and fraternity. Our peoples 
are friends and bothers. However, such ties are given concrete 
shape by economic, trade, cultural, social, and other 
cooperation. We have great potential for extensive cooperation 
in all these fields. I am sure that during my visit to Turkey 
we will conclude relevant agreements to activate this potential 
and to better use it in the future, and that such agreements 
will be reflected in relevant documents and treaties to be 
signed. 
  I will visit Turkey at the invitation of my very close 
friend 
esteemed Suleyman Demirel, whom we highly respect here. 
Undoubtedly, I will meet with all the Turkish leaders there. I 
am also ready to meet with the Turkish people, businessmen, 
scientists, and those who have an influence on Turkish life. 
The program of my visit has still to be finalized, but I am 
ready to accede to other requests outside the program. 
  I also want to note that I am personally giving great 
importance to this visit and getting ready for my visit to 
Turkey with great expectations. I hope that this visit will 
produce very positive results, and will open a new phase in the 
development of ties between Azerbaijan and Turkey. 
  [Reporter Murat] I want to ask a few questions on the 
situation at the front. You have recently scored some 
victories. The people mostly ascribe these successes to you. 
They say that after taking office Geydar Aliyev put things 
aright. What do you think is behind these successes? And my 
second question: The Turkic summit has been postponed; will it 
be held sometime in the future or has it been abandoned 
completely? 
  [Aliyev] The victories achieved in recent months in the 
struggle being waged by the Azerbaijani Army against Armenia's 
aggression are first of all the victories of the Azerbaijani 
people and the Azerbaijani Army, which is an inseparable part of 
the Azerbaijani people. The Azerbaijani people have always been 
brave and powerful. They have a history of great heroism. The 
Azerbaijani people fought for their freedom, independence, and 
the defense of their lands for centuries and have emerged 
victorious. There have been moments of defeats too. But, 
history saw the Azerbaijani people survive and has now has seen 
them emerge as an independent state. All these things were 
achieved due to the strength, effort, courage, and heroism found 
in the Azerbaijani people. 
  It could be asked why high spirits exist now and was absent 
in the past. It is simply that people should have been 
persuaded to trust their own strength. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could we say that they now trust 
their leaders? 
  [Aliyev] You know peoples' history. Turkey's history too 
confirms that a people must have faith in something. Just like 
faith in God and religion, there should be faith in the people. 
Now this faith has been forged in our Azerbaijani people. They 
now believe in their own strength. And, undoubtedly, there is 
also trust in the leadership of Azerbaijan. You yourselves can 
see this. My task has been to make people aware of their own 
strength and believe in it. We have achieved this aim, and I 
believe that we will continue to do so. 
  The successes are the result of the heroism of the 
Azerbaijani people and the heroic struggle being waged by the 
Azerbaijani sons fighting in the army ranks. My task as the 
president and commander in chief has been to guide and shape 
these efforts, to mobilize the people, to rise the people up, to 
make them trust their own strength. You are aware that I have 
been active in this direction in recent months. And, the 
results are obvious. 
  As for the summit, it has not been abandoned; it has only 
been postponed to a later date. The summit will take place. 
  [Second unidentified reporter] It is being said that in 
view of the Azerbaijani successes at the fronts and the 
continued Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict, a summit in Baku would 
have been construed as support for Azerbaijan, and that is why 
it was postponed. 
  [Aliyev] Hmmm. I do not know. There might be something to 
it, but I am not aware of it. 
  [Third unidentified reporter] Why has the military 
cooperation agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan not been 
signed yet? Will you take initiatives during your visit to 
Turkey to sign the military cooperation agreement? 
  [Aliyev] I do not know why it was not signed. However, we 
have no such plan. 
  [First unidentified reporter] The Turkish press reports that 
PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] terrorists are going from Syria to 
Armenia by various routes and then are fighting against 
Azerbaijan. Do you have information to this effect? That is, do 
you have information proving that PKK terrorists are fighting 
against you in the Armenian ranks? 
  [Aliyev] As you know, many join the Armenian ranks in the 
war 
against us. There are people from many countries. It could be 
that they [PKK] too are taking part. But, I have no definite 
information on this. However, I know that there are soldiers 
from Russia, European countries, and other countries fighting 
against us on the Armenian side. We have documents proving 
this, the prisoners confirm this. As for the PKK members' 
participation in the fighting, that too might be possible; after 
all, the PKK has close ties with Armenia. It could well be. 
  [Fourth unidentified reporter] There are reports that this 
terror organization is trying to establish bases in Sharur, 
Dashan,and Devekoy in Nakhichevan. Mustafayev, the former 
police chief of Devekoy, has declared himself president of a 
self-styled [Kurdish] region in Shushinskiy and Lachinskiy 
rayons. 
  [Aliyev] In whose name has he done that? 
  [Fourth unidentified reporter] In the name of PKK. 
  [Aliyev] I see. 
  [Fourth unidentified reporter] There are reports to this 
effect. What measures are you thinking of taking against the 
PKK in Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan? 
  [Aliyev] As you know, we have not made any decisions against 
the PKK. When I was in power in Nakhichevan there was no overt 
[PKK] activity, though they might have carried out secret work 
in the villages you mentioned. Therefore, I cannot say anything 
on this subject at this time. However I do know that there is a 
power line from Turkey to Nakhichevan and they have sabotaged 
that line two or three times and they have again sabotaged it. 
Turkey informed us that the lines were damaged by PKK members 
or by people who had come from Armenia. They cross the border 
with PKK assistance and carry out sabotage on the lines. At 
present the power line from Turkey to Nakhichevan is not 
working. It has been damaged. Of this I am aware. 
  [Fifth unidentified reporter] You recently met Boris 
Yeltsin's representative on Karabakh. You had already met with 
Vladimir Kazimirov twice in Baku. The Turkish press reported 
that the Russian plan envisages the deployment of [Russian] 
peace troops on Azerbaijan's borders with Iran and Turkey and in 
Karabakh. Did you receive such a proposal from Kazmirov? 
  [Aliyev] I met Kazimirov here. We held lengthy 
consultations. They put forward proposals for ending the war 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We too want this war to end. 
However, we did not agree with the conditions put forward. I 
told Kazimirov that, as we have often reiterated, we favor the 
ending of the war and implementation of a cease-fire, with the 
sole condition that the Armenian armed forces immediately 
withdraw from Azerbaijani territory. Their proposals and our 
proposals on conditions for the withdrawal of the Armenians do 
not coincide; therefore, we could not reach an agreement. 
However, our contacts are continuing and will continue. And if 
conditions suitable to us are put forward we might accept them. 
  After all, we do not want war. Blood is being shed and 
people are getting killed every day. Recently, the Armenian 
side suffered enormous losses. Armenia was trying to convince 
the world that the war was not between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
but between Karabakh and Azerbaijan, but now we have lots of 
proof that it is Armenia that is fighting and many of its troops 
were killed while trying to enter Kelbadzharskiy Rayon and some 
were captured. The same thing happened in Fizulinskiy and 
Agdamskiy Rayons. Armenian citizens are engaged in war there. 
We told all this to Kazimirov and we said that we favor peace 
and the ending of war provided that our condition is accepted. 
  [Fifth unidentified reporter] What was your condition: Was 
it the Armenian withdrawal from the occupied Azerbaijani lands... 
  [Aliyev, interrupting] Yes, their withdrawal. 
  [Fifth unidentified reporter]... and that there cannot be a 
question of a cease-fire as long as they do not withdraw? 
  [Aliyev] Hmm. There might be a question of it, but what we 
want is that for them to withdraw. There are also conditions 
for the withdrawal. They cannot anyway withdraw within a day. 
There are details as to when, on which day, under which 
conditions they could withdraw. 
  [Fifth unidentified reporter] Was there a discussion of the 
deployment of a Russian peace force? 
  [Aliyev] There are such ideas. However, we did not accept 
this condition. 
  [First unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] could 
Turkey 
take part in a international (?peace force)? 
  [Aliyev] We think that Turkey could take part in it; and 
Turkey should take part. Turkey must definitely take part, 
especially when the CSCE observers are deployed here. However, 
Armenia opposes Turkey's participation, it objects to it. 
  [Fifth unidentified reporter] Could Russia send a peace 
force 
here by itself alone? 
  [Aliyev] Russia wants this and is trying do it. 
  [Fifth unidentified reporter] Could Azerbaijani alone [words 
indistinct] 
  [Aliyev] As I told you, these are big issues, talks are 
needed. 
  [Sixth unidentified reporter] Yesterday the Turkish 
parliament speaker, the esteemed Husamettin Cindoruk, speaking 
on Turkish television in connection with your visit, underlined 
that only democracy befits the Turkish people and Azerbaijan. 
People from Nakhichevan are being invited to Turkey to hold 
news conferences on human rights violations. It is being said 
that you are oppressing the opposition and some political 
figures are being held in prison, and that there is not much 
information about their fate. These claims are being published 
in the Turkish press and the Turkish Government is also talking 
about the need for democracy in Azerbaijan. What is your 
approach to democracy and opposition? 
  Second, Abulfaz Elchibey is living in a mountain village. In 
Turkey, too, such internal troubles occurred in the past but 
none of our politicians or elected officials have been forced to 
return to their villages. That is, one cannot engage in 
politics in a village; after all, Baku is the political capital. 
Is there room for some flexibility. It is being claimed that 
if Elchibey returns here there will be internal turmoil. But, 
this does not sound realistic. Do you agree that all the 
opposition parties should freely work in the parliament on a 
democratic platform? And to what extent are these rumors 
correct? 
  [Aliyev] As you know, democracy is not the monopoly of one 
single person or a group of individuals. Democracy is a global 
value -- Do you understand me, I am speaking in Azeri? 
  [Reporters] Yes, yes... 
  [Aliyev] So, you do. I am speaking in Azeri. Democracy is 
a global value. It does not belong to one or two persons. 
Therefore, you should not be carried away by wrong information. 
Yet, unfortunately, here and in Turkey they divide people into 
groups. Allegedly, a certain group is prodemocracy and the 
other is not. This is not correct. Democracy has already made 
its own niche in Azerbaijan. That is, it has established 
itself. As for my position, I have always been in favor of 
democracy. Regrettably, even some people in Turkey disseminate 
negative reports about my person. They say that in the past 
Geydar Aliyev was a great communist leader and headed the Soviet 
Union, the Azerbaijani Communist Party, and that he was a 
general, and therefore he cannot be a democrat. Starting with 
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, almost all the presidents of the Turkish 
Republic were generals. However, no one says that these are not 
democrats, or that they failed to follow the path of democracy. 
Therefore, all such claims are concoctions. This is the first 
point. 
  Second, you yourselves know that I came to Azerbaijan at the 
invitation of Abulfaz Elchibey. His sitting in a village is his 
own problem. No one sent him there. I too sat in Nakhichevan 
close to three years, and I never said that anyone had forced me 
to settle there. I simply had no place other than Nakhichevan 
to go. That is why I went and settled down there. I had no 
place in Baku, that is why I went to Nakhichevan. They also 
gave me no means to make a living in Baku. This is each 
person's problem. I, as a former leader of Azerbaijan and the 
Soviet Union, never said why I stayed in Nakhichevan for three 
years. I accuse no one for this. 
  It was Abulfaz Elchibey who invited me here. I did not want 
to come here, I came only because he invited me. I was elected 
chairman of the parliament on 15 June, the day I came here. 
Since then I have always said: Azerbaijan is an independent 
state, and I will never allow the loss of this independence. 
Azerbaijan must walk along the path of democracy. Azerbaijan 
must establish a democratic and law-based state and society by 
making use of the internationally accepted democratic principles 
in accordance with the Azerbaijani national traditions and 
characteristics. This is the path followed by Azerbaijan. I am 
also walking along this path. I am also trying to take the 
Azerbaijani Government along this road. Therefore, claims of 
violation of democracy in Azerbaijan are lies. Those writing 
such things in Turkish and Azerbaijani press are writing lies. 
  The relations with the opposition here is normal. No one 
is preventing the opposition from speaking. Since my election as 
president I have repeatedly said that I am the guarantor of 
democracy, human rights, and of equal legal treatment of the 
Azerbaijani citizens regardless of their linguistic, religious 
and political affiliations. I am the guarantor of speech and 
conscience, and I favor political pluralism. I am in favor of a 
multi-party system. Here there are far more parties and papers 
than in Turkey. If Turkey has 10 major newspapers, here there 
are that many whose names I do not even know. Whoever wants can 
publish a newspaper. 
  Therefore, the talk about the strangulation of democracy is 
totally false. These claims arise from the assumption that 
allegedly there was democracy when the People's Front of 
Azerbaijan [PFA] and Abulfaz Elchibey were here. This is wrong. 
When Elchibey was in power, the interior minister used to beat 
up the reporters. I remember, once I was watching television in 
Nakhichevan. The then Prime Minister Panakh Guseynov and the 
representatives of the National Independence Party were engaged 
in a debate. Suddenly, the then Interior Minister Iskender 
Gamidov, he is the leader of the Bozkurt [Gray Wolves] 
organization -- maybe there are also Bozkurts from Turkey too in 
this organization, I don't know -- charged in and smashed the 
television studio. Could there be worst violation of democracy 
then this? Yet, Abulfaz Elchibey said nothing about it. If 
Abulfaz Elchibey or Isa Kamberov [the former chairman of the 
parliament] were guarantors of democracy they should have 
punished him that very day, because this was the worst sort of 
violation of democracy. It was violated in the most gross 
manner. They beat up hundreds of people in the past and sent 
them to hospitals during rallies in [Baku's] Azadlyg Square on 
orders from Iskender Gamidov and Azerbaijani leaders. Why was 
it was not said then that these were violations of democracy? 
But now there is not a single person or deputy jailed for his 
views. 
  Each person says and writes whatever it likes. There is 
democracy here. The PFA is not the embodiment of democracy, and 
democracy does not equal the PFA. Democracy is a larger 
concept. Turkish democracy draws its principles from 
international democracy evolved over centuries. I, as a 
political personality, have always been a democrat. You should 
not believe that there were no democratic people in the 
Communist Party. There were such people and they are now active 
in politics in Russia and everywhere else. 
  Thank you. I believe that you will work to publish in your 
papers and other information organs objective and correct 
information on the present situation in Azerbaijan. Because 
some Turkish news media and papers publish wrong information. 
This is not helpful. Everything should be correct. [video

  [Text] Riga, Feb 04, BNS -- Latvia should establish 
bilateral relations with concrete NATO member states while 
taking the first steps of cooperation with the alliance, said 
Janis Miodle, Latvian delegation head for talks with NATO, 
following his return from Brussels Friday [4 February]. 
  Latvia lacks money to build and arm its company in the 
projected Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion and begin a higher-level 
cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance. 
  Currently, it is important to clear out which countries 
would 
like to cooperate with Latvia to tackle the mentioned problems, 
Miodle said. This work could be done by a Latvian permanent 
envoy to NATO. 
  Real cooperation is even more important than simply 
assistance, Miodle noted. The cooperation should be oriented 
toward Latvia's eventual NATO membership. 
  Commenting on the Brussels visit, Miodle said NATO officers 
primarily wanted to know what Latvia concretely expected from 
Partnership for Peace and how realistic were declarations by 
Latvian leaders on their country's intention to join the program. 
  The Latvian Defense Ministry delegation toured Brussels Feb. 
2-3 at an invitation by NATO. During the trip, the group 
visited NATO, NATO Supreme Headquarters of Allied Powers in 
Europe and the North Atlantic Assembly.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Krechevisky from "Today's World" program] </F>
  [Text] An event took place which can be pointed out as a 
complete historical event. This is because it will open a new 
chapter in the relations between Vietnam and the United States, 
and it reflects the process of a new international situation 
since the end of the Cold War. 
  Clinton pointed out that the current decision does not mean 
complete normalization of relations between the two sides and 
that there still remains the problem of clarifying the fate of 
all the missing U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam war. Therefore, 
a plan is being set up to establish a U.S. liaison office in 
Hanoi. 
  According to political observers, the lifting of the trade 
embargo is nothing but an initial measure in the road for 
achieving complete normalization between Vietnam and the United 
States. This process itself shows that a lot of time will still 
be consumed until diplomatic relations are restored. The 
important thing, however, is that the lifting of the trade 
embargo was achieved. 
  The door for carrying out trade relations has opened. Hanoi 
is linking the lifting of the trade embargo with the great hope 
of introducing U.S. capital. According to Vietnamese 
economists' estimates, this will make it possible to enhance the 
role of Vietnam in the current international economic-related 
system which puts into practice important reforms and 
strengthens market organizations. 
  The Vietnamese side was successful in changing the position 
of the Washington administration by consistently overcoming 
various barriers. For example, the Vietnamese Government 
carried out much work to clarify the fate of all the missing 
U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam war and prepared and handed 
over original documents regarding this matter to the U.S. side. 
  The U.S. side is willing to conduct future joint searches to 
finish this task. In a word, Hanoi has shown sincerity, ended 
the era when bombs and bullets determined the relations between 
the two countries, and has shown a good intention. 
  Promoting economic relations and commercial cooperation is a 
top priority. U.S. businessmen who consider the tremendous 
potential of the Vietnamese market to be good have expressed 
great interest in the development of working relations between 
the United States and Vietnam. They were allowed to make 
preliminary contacts with their Vietnamese counterparts in 
December 1992. Ten representative offices opened. The U.S. 
Treasury Department allowed U.S. companies to participate in 
economic reforms in Vietnam toward the end of last year. It did 
so under the condition that international capital would be 
introduced. All the obstacles that had existed for 30 years 
have been removed. 
  Hanoi is not alone in welcoming the lifting of the economic 
embargo against Vietnam: Moscow, Beijing, and capitals of other 
countries of the world welcome the lifting of the embargo, 
saying that this is an example of a sound way of thinking and an 
affirmative measure for the future stability and prosperity of 
the Asia-Pacific region.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read commentary by station commentator </F>
Kondratyev; from the "Good Evening, China" program] 
  [Text] The U.S. Senate's vote to lift the trade embargo on 
Vietnam in late January to a great extent heralded President 
Clinton's announcement on Thursday [3 February]. Needless to 
say, the announcement is an important event which will exert a 
favorable influence not only on U.S.-Vietnamese relations but 
also on the situation in Indochina as a whole. 
  In recent years, Vietnam has done a host of work searching 
for U.S. soldiers missing in action from the Vietnam war. It 
can be stated with certainty that after the lifting of trade 
embargo, Hanoi will more actively cooperate with Washington in 
solving this issue which is rather sensitive to the American 
people. 
  Another factor in lifting the trade embargo is economics. 
U.S. business circles have estimated that their losses in 
Vietnam resulting from the trade embargo amount to $700-800 
million annually. It is true that U.S. companies are allowed to 
do business in Vietnam, but this is only in partnership with 
companies of other countries. Such business restrictions can, 
of course, limit the profits of U.S. businessmen. According to 
experts' estimates, Vietnam is one of the few Southeast Asian 
countries with the best potential for economic cooperation. 
Undoubtedly, Vietnam is also an indispensable springboard for 
economic cooperation with other countries on the Indochinese 
peninsula. 
  The lifting of the trade embargo on Vietnam will also exert 
a 
favorable influence on restoring U.S.-Vietnamese diplomatic 
relations and political contacts. Washington has decided to set 
up a liaison office in Hanoi, and it can be converted into a 
diplomatic mission in the future. 
  What is noteworthy is that the lifting of the embargo on 
Vietnam has also activated the campaign in the United States to 
end the trade embargo on its neighbor, Cuba. Many mass 
organizations and business representatives have taken part in 
the campaign. U.S. businessmen are dissatisfied over being 
deprived of the opportunity to invest in Cuba while their 
competitors from Europe and Latin America are actively exploring 
markets in Cuba. As time passes, the lifting of the U.S. trade 
embargo on Cuba will likely become a more heated issue.

newscast] 
  [Text] By decision of the Tajik Government, the state 
national security committee has been transformed into the Tajik 
Security Ministry. What is the reason for this and what will it 
change in the work of what was once a menacing department? 
Besides catching spies, the department is currently involved in 
dozens of tasks ranging from border defense and the confiscation 
of weapons to distributing bread to the shops. 
  [Begin recording] [S. Zukhurov, Tajik security minister] We 
got rid of the words national security. Questions arose because 
national security implies protecting the interests of only the 
indigenous nationality, the indigenous peoples. With the 
formation of the ministry, we shall probably bear the 
responsibility for the fight against economic crime. Trends 
like the fight against terrorism, against the drug mafia, 
against arms smuggling will be stepped up. 
  [Khodzhayev] Will the functions of the Security Ministry -- 
we shall call it that -- include the struggle against the 
political opposition? 
  [Zukhurov] We are categorically opposed to such a method of 
struggle, because, we are seeking all paths, possibilities for 
dialogue with the opposition. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan] </F>
  [Text] Peshawar--Reliable sources with connections to the 
Tajik opposition told AL-HAYAH yesterday that the leaders of the 
opposition have offered a detailed plan to the Pakistani 
Government to settle the conflict in Tajikistan. 
  These sources added that the settlement formula was offered 
by Turadzhonzoda, the former chief qadi of Tajikistan who is the 
military commander of the [Islamic] Revival Party, the strongest 
of the Tajik parties, and by Davlat Usmon, the prime minister 
before the Communists took over the regime. 
  The formula, which the two leaders laid out in a meeting 
with 
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali at the end of last 
month in the Pakistani capital, will be included in a conference 
in which the Tajik opposition, the government, and 
representatives from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, 
and the Islamic Conference Organization will participate. During 
it, a neutral government will be formed to run the country for a 
limited time after which general elections would be held. The 
conference will possibly be held in March in the Pakistani city 
of Lahore. 
  Sources near Turadzhonzoda told AL-HAYAH yesterday that the 
latter suggested putting peacekeeping forces in place from Iran, 
Afghanistan, and Pakistan to take the arms out of Tajikistan and 
work to establish security in the country. The sources conveyed 
Turadzhonzoda's fear that a failure to disarm will lead to 
bloody civil wars, especially since vengeance is deeply rooted 
in the Tajik mind and may turn the situation there into another 
Afghanistan. 
  An informed source says that all sides agreed on the plan 
and 
Asif Ali Khan had presented it this month to the Asian republics. 
  Uzbekistan, (the big brother) of the Asian republics, 
aspires 
to play a prominent role in solving the Tajik conflict, fearing 
that it will extend to its territory. Some 25 percent of the 
population of Tajikistan is Uzbek, and there are a million 
Tajiks in Uzbekistan. For this reason, Uzbekistan is attempting 
to impose its own counsel on these republics. Uzbekistan also 
does not hide its discomfort with the presumptuous Russian role 
in Tajikistan, which has issued its own currency to replace the 
ruble.

  [Text] Munich, Germany, AP-BNS -- British and German 
leaders on Saturday [5 February] warned Russia to respect the 
integrity of its former Soviet neighbors. 
  Worries about Russia's relations with the Baltic states and 
other former Soviet republics took center stage at a two-day 
meeting on strategic and military issues where William Perry 
made his international debut as U.S. defense secretary. Perry 
sat between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the German Defense 
Minister, Volker Ruehe, at the gathering of defense ministers, 
politicians, officers and defense experts, which he was to 
address Sunday. 
  Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, was quoted last 
month as saying Russia should keep troops in former Soviet 
republics to protect its vital interests. Many people worry 
that the Russian Government, under pressure from 
ultranationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovksiy, could start 
bullying the new countries of the former Soviet bloc to get its 
way. 
  William S. Cohen, a Republican senator from Maine, thinks 
this is starting to happen already. "We have to keep a very 
close eye on what the Russian military is up to," Cohen said. 
"They have been engaged in a protectionist racket by bringing 
governments to their knees and rushing in with aid, provided 
they join the Commonwealth of Independent states, which is under 
the protection of Russia," Cohen said. 
  Malcolm Rifkind, the British defense secretary, said NATO's 
immediate priority must be to agree on a strategy for dealing 
with any attempt by Russia to "regain hegemony" in areas of the 
former Soviet Union. "One not only hears from the 
Zhirinovskiys" the demand for greater Russian influence, he 
said. "One hears it also from those who speak in much more 
measured tones." Kozyrev has "made speeches of that kind," 
Rifkind said. 
  Kohl said the West must avoid doing anything that would make 
Russia feel internationally isolated, since that could 
jeopardize efforts by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to make 
greater strides in democratic and economic reforms. He said 
Yeltsin had written him recently to assure that he "will not 
listen" to those who call for renewed Russian expansionism. But 
it's unclear whether Yeltsin can withstand nationalist 
pressures, Kohl indicated. He cautioned Russia not to act 
aggressively against the former Soviet republics: "We expect 
Russia to continue a foreign policy marked by constructive 
participation in solving international problems." 
  The German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, issued a blunter 
statement in a speech Friday night in Bonn. He demanded Russia 
respect its borders and said the Russians could expect a cutoff 
of aid if they stopped economic reforms. 
  Kinkel demanded the full pullout of Russian troops from 
Latvia and Estonia by the end of August and upbraided Russian 
leaders for using the term "near abroad" to describe the former 
Soviet republics. "It implies an inferior status for Russia's 
neighbors that is not acceptable," Kinkel said. The term is 
commonly used by Russian politicians and newspapers. Kinkel 
said the resignations of Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar and Finance 
Minister Boris Fedorov last month "threaten to destroy trust" in 
Russia's economic future, as reflected in large-scale capital 
flight. "If Russia's economic policy can't even keep Russian 
capital in the country, how can Russia expect inflows of foreign 
capital?" Kinkel said. 
  Germany has provided 90 billion marks (about dlrs 52 
billion) 
over the past five years to Russia, more than half of all 
Western contributions. "There won't be more money for less 
reform," he said.

<F P=106> [Anastasiya Romashkevich report: "Russia's Transcaucasus </F>
Policy. Baku and Yerevan Cannot Be Reconciled Yet"] 
  [Excerpts] The CSCE-sponsored informal consultations of 
"the Minsk Group of Nine" on the settlement of the conflict in 
Nagorno-Karabakh will resume in Vienna today. The meeting will 
take place against a rocky background: Starting from 
mid-December hostilities flared up twice in the conflict area, 
and Russian attempts to broker a temporary cease-fire failed 
last week. Vladimir Kazimirov, special envoy and the Russian 
president's representative to the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, 
kindly agreed to comment on the situation in the area of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. [passage omitted] 
  According to the Russian diplomat, the positions of those 
who 
advocate conflict settlement by force are still fairly strong, 
which was actually the main reason a truce due to start 1 
February fell through. He complained that the sides' statements 
on their desire to achieve peace have often turned out to be 
mere "camouflage" to conceal their military actions. 
Nonetheless, the diplomat pointed to the statement made by 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev 31 January on security 
guarantees to the Armenian population in Karabakh in the event 
of a cease-fire by the Armenian side. However, Vladimir 
Kazimirov said, owing to distrust between the two sides, this 
appeal is unlikely to find a response among the Armenians. 
  According to Mr. Kazimirov, claims that Russia plans to send 
its troops to the conflict area "are not quite correct." What 
is actually at issue is the need to send disengagement forces 
there. The operation itself should be multinational in nature, 
but the national lineup of the contingent is yet to be 
determined. The diplomat noted that it would be desirable that 
the contingent be given a UN mandate: unlike CSCE forces, "blue 
helmets" may carry out forcible operations (that is, to be 
present in a conflict area without consent of the warring 
sides). [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 7 TASS -- Prominent political expert 
and head of a group in charge of national politics of the 
presidential council, Emil Pain, believes that promoting the 
activities of joint institutions of the CIS is a way for 
strengthening the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS Pain said that prospects of 
the Commonwealth depend not on territorial integration, but on 
the creation of joint structures which would perform the 
functions of the court of arbitration -- coordination of 
opinions, ideas and settlement of disputes. 
  Pain believes that the existence of such institutions might 
help resolve many problems which nowadays lead to conflicts. 
"For example, the revival of the idea of joint armed forces 
would practically resolve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. 
The Black Sea Fleet would be subordinate then not to Russia or 
Ukraine, but to the joint armed forces of the Commonwealth," 
Pain said. 
  If there were a single Eurasian bank for reconstruction and 
development, it would to a considerable extent promote the 
solution of problems of the monetary union, while a bank in 
support of refugees and resettlers would help regulate migration 
processes, he said. The expert believes that on the one hand, 
the optimum concept for the CIS consists in the development of 
integration structures, and on the other hand, in the idea of 
selective partnership at the level of bilateral relations which 
cannot be avoided. 
  Pain thinks that "Russia must take a cautions and selective 
approach to unions with its neighbours and aid to them. This 
partnership should rest not on the prospect of joining other 
territories to Russia, but on ensuring stability and safety of 
its borders." 
  "In this sense, stable countries deserve better aid from 
Russia," Pain said, adding that Russia can be satisfied not with 
any kind of stability, but rather with stability which is based 
on the operation of democratic institutions.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- ROSSIYSKYE VESTI 
frontpages a series of brief reports indicating that working 
people in the Russian Federation are increasingly dissatisfied 
with their socio- economic position. 
  Movement may accelerate the progress of reforms or may blow 
them up. This is yet another poser for the government which is 
pressed for time in this respect..." [sentence as received] 
  ROSSIYSKYE VESTI today begins the publication of a series of 
articles revealing the logic and nature of the formation of 
vertical ties between local executive power bodies. The first 
article is by Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Russian presidential 
administration's directorate for territorial affairs. 
  Having recalled that the power bodies of the subjects of the 
federation (regions, territories, and republics) were formed on 
the strength of "momo-party" lists and that the elected 
officials constitute the old system of local governing councils, 
Medvedev writes that, as a result, the two systems of state 
power in Russia were doomed to confrontation. 
  "The main task now is to reform the second stage of state 
power or the second element as represented by the state power of 
the subjects of the federation. As a result, better prepared 
people are to take office," Medvedev points out. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the need to combat mounting 
inflation. 
  An article to this effect strongly cricicises Russian 
businessmen -- a "class of proprietors - the main social base of 
reforms" -- for not being in a hurry to boost and modernise 
production and for prefering "to keep their money in foreign 
banks". 
  Referring to the Washington-based Institute of International 
Finance, the newspaper points out that the amount of outflowing 
capital is already 30,000 million U.S. dollars, with 2,000 
million dollars being added to them every month. "So, who helps 
whom, we to the West or the West to us is the question. An 
answer is not without interest, the newspaper points out. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russian 
Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, dealing with the recent mortar 
attack on a market in Sarajevo, when 68 people were killed and 
about 200 wounded. 
  Churkin's opinion is that the main problem in the Yugoslav 
conflict is posed by extremist approaches by all the three 
conflicting sides, including the Serbs. 
  "Those who state that we as Slavs should side with the Serbs 
bestow a doubtful benefit on the Serbs because they support 
those of them who push their oun people to suicide," Churkin 
pointed out. "In any case, there should be a question of a 
political solution to the problem of Sarajevo and Bosnia as a 
whole", he said. 
  TRUD on the results of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
recent official visit to Georgia: 
  "One must give due credit to the courage of Boris Yeltsin 
who 
decided to visit Tbilisi -- the city where no one can be sure 
that his next step would be as safe as the previous one". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA opens up with a report on preparations 
for elections local government bodies in St. Petersburg. 
[sentence as received] The electoral bloc "the Democratic Unity 
of Petersburg", which unites about 30 organisations of reformist 
orientation, now stands chances to get the largest number of 
seats in the city assembly. Members of Russia's Choice 
constitute the core of this bloc. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Russia's military doctrine: 
  "The basic distinguishing feature of Russia's new military 
doctrine is that it gives the president and the government the 
right to use the armed forces to fight not only an external 
enemy but also an internal one as well". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an article about former Chief 
Justice of Russia's Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin. The 
newspaper writes about him with respect and compassion.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "Trying To Play `Amnesty Card' for </F>
Political Purposes"] 
  [Text] The draft agenda for the 4 February plenary session 
of the State Duma, which was submitted to deputies for approval, 
was mainly devoted to rather routine questions concerning the 
internal life of the lower house's legislators. But it has been 
learned that the original plans envisaged debates on such 
important questions as the State Duma's draft declaration on 
succession and draft laws on amendments to the Criminal Code and 
on an amnesty. 
  Commenting at the editorial office's request on this marked 
difference between the original plans and the final version of 
the agenda, M. Mityukov, first deputy chairman of the State 
Duma, reported, in particular, that the draft declaration on 
succession prepared by V. Isakov, chief of the Duma's 
Legislation Committee, was not recommended for consideration as 
a result of two Duma Council sessions because, in the opinion of 
most council members, it was quite clearly aimed at a 
confrontation between the Duma and the president and had all the 
prerequisites for dragging legislators into a lengthy process of 
discussing the president's edicts issued from 21 September 
through 24 December last year. Mityukov believes that Isakov's 
main aim was, in camouflaged terms and in a competently compiled 
legal document, to throw doubt on the president's norm-creating 
activity. 
  Neither could the factions reach agreement on the draft law 
on amendments to the Criminal Code. This sounds paradoxical, 
because in their election programs practically all parties, 
associations, and deputies promised to fight crime ruthlessly. 
But the proposals made by the "Russia's Choice" faction -- 
which envisage, in particular, the standardization of 
responsibility for crimes against property (the concept of 
"socialist ownership" is excluded here), increased punishments 
for terrorism and organized crime, and the extension of 
citizen's rights to necessary self-defense -- did not meet with 
support from the bloc of communists, agrarians, and the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia. It is worth noting that this draft 
law was adopted by the former Russian Supreme Soviet in its 
first reading without any problems. 
  Neither was it possible to submit the draft law on an 
amnesty 
for discussion. The formal reason for this was the lack of an 
official letter from the president on submitting the draft law 
to the State Duma. But the main reason for postponing 
consideration was once again the position of certain factions 
which, according to Mityukov, "tried to play the amnesty card 
for their political purposes and which want, on top of 20,000 
convicted invalids, pensioners, women, and war veterans, to 
pluck the participants in the October events out of Lefortovo." 
  Consequently the agenda turned out to be a rather tame one 
which did not promise any furors. Possibly wanting to 
capitalize on the polemical potential that accumulated during 
the week, most State Duma members decided to supplement the 
agenda with the favorite question of all Soviet deputies -- "On 
Mass Media Coverage of the State Duma's Activity."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 7 TASS -- Yegor Gaydar, former 
Russian first vice-premier and currently leader of the "Russia's 
Choice" parliamentary faction, said that on Wednesday [9 
February], the State Duma will, apparently, discuss problems 
connected with scheduled elections to local bodies of power and 
a draft of permanent rules of procedure, adding that at 
present, the Duma works according to temporary rules of 
procedure. 
  Gaydar pointed out that continuous debates in parliament 
were 
caused by a draft resolution "On Amnesty in Connection With the 
Adoption of the Constitution of the Russian Federation." The 
draft resolution on amnesty was submitted to parliament for 
approval by President Boris Yeltsin. The Duma decided to return 
the draft resolution to parliamentary commissions and committees 
for thorough consideration since it caused a different reaction 
at a session of the Duma council. Explaining the position of 
the Russia's Choice bloc on this matter, Gaydar said that "we 
asked the president not to submit the resolution to the Duma, on 
the grounds of the existing criminal situation in the country 
and inadequate interpretation of the problem." 
  The Duma council also discussed the appointment of the Duma 
chief of staff. According to Gaydar, chairman of the lower 
house of the Russian parliament, Ivan Rybkin, was suggested to 
select one of three candidates planned to be given the post and 
express his opinion at a session of the Duma council. Gaydar 
did not say exactly, but merely mentioned that the Russia's 
Choice bloc supports the candidacy of Vladimir Podoprigora. 
However, Podoprigora cannot be relieved of his duties yet as 
chairman of the Federation Council's Committee for International 
Affairs, which is regarded by many deputies as a serious 
obstacle preventing his appointment to the post. 
  According to Gaydar, the Duma council did not discuss recent 
developments in former Yugoslavia. However, he added that 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is expected to make a statement on this 
problem at a plenary session of the Duma on Wednesday.

parliamentary delegation to the former Yugoslavia. 
  At Monday's [7 February] session held by the Duma's Council 
(which includes the speaker, his deputies and the leaders of all 
factions), he said that the Duma must evaluate the situation in 
the former Yugoslav republics based on conclusions made by its 
official delegation, not on the impressions of "a tourist," even 
if that tourist is the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party 
faction, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  On Wednesday Zhirinovskiy intends to brief the Duma on his 
recent trip to Yugoslavia. 
  In the meantime the leader of the Russian Unity and Accord 
faction in the Duma, Sergey Shakhray, told journalists on Monday 
that the proposed bombing of Serb positions surrounding the 
capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sarajevo, will lead to nothing. 
  The issue of bombing Serb positions by NATO aircraft was 
raised following Saturday's explosion in Sarajevo's market place 
in which 68 people were killed. Bosnian Muslims laid the blame 
for the barbarous terrorist act on the Serbs. 
  "Bombardments cannot resolve such problems -- they can only 
delay solution to the conflict," Shakhray pointed out. If the 
situation is further aggravated and Serb positions around 
Sarajevo are bombed, his faction will make an official statement 
in the Duma, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Isakov, chairman of Russian </F>
Federation State Duma Committee for Legislation and Judicial and 
Legal Reform, by Yuriy Zvyagin; place and date not given: 
"Vladimir Isakov: Respect for the Law Will Triumph"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Isakov has a reputation as an experienced 
parliamentarian. This is evidently why the State Duma deputies 
elected him to one of the key posts in their chamber -- that of 
chairman of the Committee for Legislation and Judicial and Legal 
Reform. 
  [Isakov] Our small committee has been set extraordinarily 
great tasks. It has to prepare and make a preliminary 
examination of drafts of federal constitutional laws, federal 
laws in the spheres of human rights, the judicial system, civil, 
civil-procedural, criminal, criminal-procedural, and corrective 
labor law, and legislation on administrative offenses, and 
amnesty decrees. 
  We are obliged to make a preliminary examination of 
proposals 
for a revision of the Russian Federation Constitution and for 
amendments to it and to organize parliamentary hearings on 
questions of implementing the Constitution and federal 
constitutional laws. We are required to prepare rulings on 
draft laws and also to monitor the execution of legislation. 
  [Zvyagin] Are the committee's members sufficiently ready for 
responsible work, and does the difference in their political 
views and the fact that sometimes they are even opposed not 
embarrass you? 
  [Isakov] Indeed, we all have very different political 
partialities. But then there is also something which unites 
literally all of us. We are jurists. Many have academic 
degrees and have had plenty of practice. I myself am a doctor 
of juridical sciences and a professor, and I was chairman of the 
former Supreme Soviet's Committee for Constitutional 
Legislation. I have devoted considerable effort to lawmaking. 
  The same can be said of Boris Zolotukhin, my deputy. He used 
to tackle problems of judicial and legal reform on the former 
analogous committee. Zolotukhin represents "Russia's Choice." 
Another deputy of mine is Dr. of Juridical Sciences Viktor 
Vishnyakov (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia), leading 
associate at the Institute of Legislation and Comparative 
Jurisprudence. A third is Sergey Zenkin (Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord), a lecturer at Ivanovo State University. 
  I believe that we will also be able to make successful use 
of 
the rich experience of Anatoliy Lukyanov and Professors Vladimir 
Tumanov and Viktor Sheynis. Incidentally, before being elected 
to the State Duma, the latter was, along with Boris Zolotukhin, 
a member of the Legislative Proposals Commission under the 
Russian Federation president. They have all done considerable 
work over almost the whole range of problems. As regards the 
diversity of political views, this diversity must be overcome by 
respect for the law. 
  [Zvyagin] Has the committee already gotten involved in 
lawmaking activity? 
  [Isakov] Of course. We have already prepared a Russian 
Federation draft law on the procedure for publishing and 
bringing into force federal constitutional laws, federal laws, 
and acts of the chambers of the Federal Assembly. This is one 
of the fundamental, top-priority documents. 
  Our committee has also prepared another important document. 
It is the declaration on the legal succession of the Federal 
Assembly with regard to the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of 
Russian Federation People's Deputies. In particular, we hope 
for the return to parliament of the Institute of Legislation and 
Comparative Jurisprudence. 
  [Zvyagin] What is your contribution to the entire State 
Duma's plan of law-drafting work? 
  [Isakov] Since the members of our committee have more 
experience of lawmaking work than others, people heed our voice. 
We are now seeking to draw the paramount attention of all 
committees to the creation of federal constitutional and federal 
laws which stem from the Russian Federation Constitution and 
which ensure its operation. Among the drafts of normative acts, 
to draw attention to those aimed at more fully defending 
citizens' rights and freedoms, developing the social sphere, and 
strengthening state-legal foundations. Members of our committee 
will also take a very direct part in drawing up the majority of 
future legal normative documents. Above all, this means these 
laws: on the state flag; the state anthem; the referendum; on 
the Russian Federation Constitutional Assembly; on the 
government; on the judicial system; on the commissioner for 
human rights. 
  More than other members of parliamentary formations, we will 
have to tackle the preparation of draft codes of legislation: 
civil, criminal, criminal-procedural, criminal-executive, air, 
land, tax, housing, and labor legislation, legislation on 
marriage and the family, on administrative offenses, and others. 
  [Zvyagin] What other draft laws which need to be examined 
and adopted without delay could you name? 
  [Isakov] On the procedure for ensuring the opportunity for 
citizens to familiarize themselves with documents and materials 
which directly affect their rights and freedoms; on public 
associations; on the procedure for holding rallies, 
demonstrations, processions, and pickets; on elections to the 
State Duma, on the procedure for forming the Federation Council 
of the Federal Assembly, on the main provisions for elections to 
organs of local self-management; on federal state service; on 
the application of citizens to state organs and organs of local 
self-management. I also deem it obligatory for us to 
participate in the work on them, for the Committee for 
Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform is responsible for the 
quality of our entire new parliament's lawmaking.

  [Text] Moscow February 7 TASS -- Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev has so far refrained from responding to an opposition 
leader's statement demanding his resignation. 
  Ibragim Sulaymenov, one of the opposition leaders, demanded 
on Monday that Dudayev step down as the republic's president, 
"make public his accounts in western banks for one billion U.S. 
dollars and choose which court -- secular or sheriat -- he wants 
to be tried by." 
  Apparently, Chechen leaders do not consider Sulaymenov's 
ultimatum carried by some mass media worth their attention. 
According to reports from Grozny, the capital of the Chechen 
Republic, the situation in the republic is "surprisingly calm" 
and is under the president's control.

  [Text] The statements by one of the leaders of the armed 
Chechen opposition, Ibragim Suleymenov, that the situation in 
the republic has sharply deteriorated and that the opposition 
units held a military exercise there are not true, according to 
the Chechen Press and Information Ministry. An INTERFAX 
correspondent reports from the republican capital of Groznyy 
that opposition units remain in the barracks and are holding no 
exercises at the moment. 
  The Chechen presidential office told INTERFAX that it was a 
"gross provocation by certain forces in the Russian leadership 
trying to disrupt the dialogue between Russia and Chechnya which 
has just begun." All this is happening on the eve of the 
Chechen government delegation's departure for Moscow for the 
bilateral interstate talks, the same sources said. 
  Meanwhile, Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev had his usual 
busy day on Monday. This morning he visited an officers' 
college in Groznyy.

  [Text] Nazran February 7 TASS -- Ruslan Aushev, president 
of Ingushetia, a tiny Caucasian republic of Russia, said at a 
press conference on Monday [7 February] that he would not run 
for local president at the upcoming elections scheduled for 
February 27. 
  Monday is the last day for registration of candidates for 
the 
post of the president and vice-president of Ingushetia. 
  Aushev was elected a member of the upper chamber of the 
Russian parliament, the Federation Council, last December 12. 
  His republic is in an ethnic and territorial conflict with 
neighbouring North Ossetia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lozov, head of the North Ossetian </F>
Interim Administration, by Major Vladimir Gilyuk in Vladikavkaz; 
date not given: "Conflict Zone: Are Leaders Wise Enough?"] 
  [Text] As you know, the state of emergency regime has been 
extended in a number of rayons of Ingushetia and North Ossetia 
by Russian presidential edict. This enforced measure was 
approved at a closed session of the Federation Council. The 
upper chamber of the Russian parliament will continue seeking 
ways to settle the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. The sides 
themselves have viewed the extension of the regime with 
understanding, but without approval. Today we are publishing an 
interview with Vladimir Lozov, head of the Interim 
Administration, in which he hints that the skepticism of the 
parties to the conflict is nonetheless unfounded. 
  [Gilyuk] Vladimir Demyanovich, what is your view of the 
current situation in the state of emergency area? 
  [Lozov] It is still extremely complex. This is because -- 
in the view of the Ossetian and the Ingush sides, with which I 
can agree there has still been no political assessment of the 
armed conflict. The facts are borne out by the results of 
sociological studies conducted by the Interim Administration. 
Some 80 percent of Ossetians and 20 percent of the Ingush 
advocate publishing such an assessment. What is more, the 
factors that gave rise to the conflict have not been eliminated. 
  [Gilyuk] Can you tell us what they are? 
  [Lozov] In first place I would cite the Ingush Republic 
leadership's continuing claims to part of the territory of North 
Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon. As for the Ossetian side, it has 
still not adopted a decision distancing itself from the idea 
that it is impossible to cohabit with the Ingush. 
  What is more, a huge arsenal of weapons has been stockpiled 
in this region. And, as you know, these weapons are being used. 
Nor is there a unified regional policy on fighting crime. 
There is no well-organized cooperation between these republics' 
law-enforcement structures. 
  The socioeconomic and demographic situation in the region is 
tricky. Tens of thousands of innocent citizens have lost their 
homes.... 
  [Gilyuk] What steps must be taken to implement the Russian 
president's edict of 13 December last year and the accords 
reached in the city of Nalchik? 
  [Lozov] In our view it is first necessary to formulate 
coordinated measures to implement the provisions of the edict 
and the protocol adopted at the meeting of North Caucasus 
republic leaders in Nalchik. They have not yet been elaborated. 
Even then they have, they will need to be implemented. 
  [Gilyuk] What has the Interim Administration done to this 
end? 
  [Lozov] We have succeeded in stabilizing the situation: The 
number of provocations and terrorist manifestations has dropped. 
We have incorporated our own view of how to settle the conflict 
in a number of proposals now being considered by Ingushetia and 
North Ossetia. Provision is being made to organize and hold 
talks with a view to working out coordinated practical steps to 
improve the situation in the region, confiscate unauthorized 
weapons -- the use of which is poorly monitored by local 
law-enforcement organs -- and detect and suppress the activity 
of extremist and nationalist individuals and groups which are 
trying to hobble the emergent process of rapprochement and the 
longed-for reconciliation of the two republics' peoples. It is 
planned to carry out a series of measures aimed at resolving the 
social and economic questions involved in bringing back, 
resettling, and looking after refugees and enforced migrants on 
the two republics' territory. 
  [Gilyuk] Apart from the above plans, has the Interim 
Administration made any progress or achieved any concrete 
results in its activity? 
  [Lozov] Yes. But first I must talk about the material and 
financial "injections" from the Russian Federation Government. 
In the last year direct spending alone to stabilize the 
situation in the state of emergency area has cost the Russian 
budget over 30 billion rubles, and remarkably, Russian subsidies 
make up the overwhelming proportion of both sides' budgets. 
  We conducted an inventory of all the facilities in four 
population centers. A total of 2,389 homes and 63 social 
facilities were surveyed. To show you the scale of the tragedy 
and the amount of work that lies ahead let me tell you that only 
915 of the 2,389 homes remained intact and 33 of the 63 social 
and consumer facilities had been destroyed or damaged. 
  [Gilyuk] Vladimir Demyanovich, what must be done primarily 
to begin the process of bringing back refugees and enforced 
migrants? 
  [Lozov] I am convinced that the process of bringing back 
enforced migrants must go hand in hand with moves to reconcile 
the inhabitants. A meeting of the two republics' presidents 
with a view to coordinating and formulating practical steps 
pertaining to the whole question of solving refugees' problems 
and other issues in the Kislovodsk agreements would be an 
extremely important political step ensuring that favorable 
conditions are created for the edict to be fulfilled. I want to 
stress that without political will and wisdom from the two 
leaders, backed up by the republics' organs of government and 
socionational movements, it will be impossible to reconcile the 
peoples and on that basis to bring people back and look after 
them.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] Russian presidential council member Emil Pain, who 
heads the Ethnic Policy Research Center of the Russian Foreign 
Policy Association, is convinced that the Russian leadership 
should not place special emphasis on coming to terms with 
Tatarstan in the process of making Russia a federal state. 
  He told Interfax Monday [7 February] that he did not see 
much 
sense in hurrying up the signing of a treaty between the Russian 
Federation and Tatarstan on mutual delegation of powers at the 
expense of "unprincipled concessions" by Moscow. "The treaty is 
being worded, there is a schedule of drafting documents and 
there has been no departure from the constitutional process," 
Payin believes. 
  In his view, similar treaties on power sharing between the 
center and the Federation's constituent parts must be signed 
with all Russia's areas. "It would be highly undesirable to make 
some constituent part an exceptional case," Payin emphasized. 
  Staying away from the elections does more harm to Tatarstan 
than to Russia, Payin said. In his words, by ignoring the 
December parliamentary elections that republic lost the chance 
of being represented in the Federation's top legislature and of 
influencing federal policies, particularly as far as the shaping 
the structure of the Federation is concerned.

  [Text] Khabarovsk, 7 Feb -- The heads of Far Eastern krays 
and oblasts who participated in a conference on the region's 
energy supply problems in Khabarovsk have adopted an appeal to 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The slump in production in the 
Far East has reached a critical point, it stresses, and a 
further reduction in the production and supply of energy cannot 
be permitted. The cost of a kilowatt-hour of electricity in 
some parts of the Far East has reached 200 rubles, whereas in 
central parts of Russia it is 16 rubles. The decisions of 
government bodies for the development of the Far East's fuel and 
energy base are not being fulfilled. 
  In order to avoid the complete shutdown of industrial and 
other enterprises, the heads of administration of krays and 
oblasts in the Far East are asking the Russian president to 
urgently examine the question of state support for the region's 
economy. In particular, the Far East workers are hoping to 
obtain loans and credits amounting to 140 billion rubles to 
settle their debt for petroleum products sent to the region. 
The territories are also asking for the federal budget debt to 
enterprises in the state sector amounting to 450 billion rubles 
to be written off. A number of other questions regarding the 
supply of vital needs to the region are also raised in the 
appeal.

  [Text] Ukraine will be a non-nuclear state and will 
"shortly" join the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the 
Ukrainian ambassador to Russia said. 
  Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told a news conference in Moscow on 
Monday that the Ukrainian parliament had now approved all the 
points of Article Five of the Lisbon Protocol. "This eliminates 
the main problem, and now everything is ready for joining the 
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the 
immediate future," he said. All nuclear arms will be removed 
from Ukraine, he said. 
  Kryzhanovsky said the Ukrainian legislature had charged the 
government with the exchanging of the START-I ratification 
instruments and instructed it to take more efforts to enter into 
relevant international agreements. 
  The ambassador did not rule out that Ukraine's membership in 
the Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state would be 
approved by the present parliament, but said this was most 
likely to be done by the next legislature, to be elected on 
March 27. 
  Commenting on Ukraine's relations with Russia, Kryzhanovskiy 
said there was some friction but that it had set off no 
conflicts between the two nations. As for the idea of the 
incorporation of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea 
into Russia through a Crimean referendum, he said it would be 
the same as the incorporation of Russia's Kuril Islands into 
Japan on the basis of the results of a referendum by the Kuril 
population. "That's not serious," he said. 
  He said none of the former Soviet republics, including 
Russia, "has given a kopeck" to return Crimean Tatars to Crimea.

<F P=106> [Olga Musafirova report: "May We Join?.. The Ukrainian </F>
Parliament Will No Longer Stymie the Nuclear Disarmament of the 
State"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- It was simply a crushing victory for Leonid 
Kravchuk. Once again he mixed his supporters and opponents 
together in the Supreme Council to produce new political loaves 
in the way that a good housewife kneads dough. Leonid 
Makarovich listened carefully first to the microphone on the 
left which promised him the Nobel Peace Prize and then to the 
microphone on the right which threatened him with Article 56 of 
the Criminal Code for treason on an especially large scale. And 
all this for a three-page statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia delivered in Moscow on 14 
January. 
  Meanwhile the stove had been lit and the loaves knew that 
they would have to leap into it. Ukraine's nuclear weapons are 
-- thanks to the economic policy of the last two years -- the 
only commodity which the West has dreamed of buying here, buying 
in order to destroy them. 
  However, the Supreme Council was required not to sign but, 
on 
the contrary, to erase something, to strike out its so-called 
"warnings" over an article in Protocol Five of the START Treaty 
as enshrined by decree in November 1993 so that the document was 
not at odds with the three-page statement of the presidents 
which had already been agreed upon. 
  The situation was lent special piquancy by the fact that the 
"Moscow pact" -- neither the statement itself nor the appendices 
to it containing specific figures and deadlines for Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament -- did not need ratification at all. And 
the debates in parliament guaranteed their participants profound 
moral satisfaction only. 
  Leonid Makarovich bore the blows of fate in worthy fashion. 
He forgave his attackers: "I understand it is a difficult 
decision for you to make..." He encouraged those who thought 
like him: "I received a letter from Clinton at lunchtime. He 
writes that he is doubling economic aid to Ukraine." True, the 
real issues remained off stage: The questions of interest to 
the technicians and professionals like Kuchma of how modern 
solid-fuel SS-24 missiles are going to be scrapped if the 
technology for recycling them does not yet exist in the world; 
who will solve the problem of utilizing weapons-grade plutonium; 
what to do with the abandoned missile silos, and so forth. A 
purely political rather than a comprehensive approach to nuclear 
disarmament can only result in either blatant deception of the 
whole world or upheaval within the Ukrainian state system. But 
the president was as good as his word: He exerted his influence 
and led people toward a compromise. 
  With just a couple of minutes to go before the end of the 
working day parliament was persuaded that it was being taken 
into account, established a quorum, and pushed the "yes" button. 
Unconditional ratification of START I was carried. The new 
decree was prepared by the president himself as a legislative 
initiative. True, during voting the third paragraph -- on 
accession to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons of 1 July 1968 -- got unexpectedly dropped: Someone 
remembered that deputies had not actually seen the document 
themselves, which was inconvenient.... Therefore Ukraine has not 
subscribed to it, although it now wished to!

  [Text] Kiev -- Vasyl Katko, deputy chairman of the Ukraine 
State Committee for the use of Nuclear Power, commenting on 4 
February on the decision by the Supreme Council regarding the 
further fate of Ukrainian nuclear missiles at the request of a 
UNIAN correspondent, observed that "the Russian fuel produced 
from Ukrainian missiles with nuclear warheads could be 
inaccessible for Ukrainian nuclear power stations." He noted 
that according to the agreement with Russia, only the uranium 
due to Ukraine will be free of charge for it [Ukraine], which 
comes to approximately 25-30 percent of the fuel content of 
nuclear power stations. "But if one is to take into account the 
fact that Russia in fact increases the price of fuel by 40-50 
percent every quarter, then one cannot talk about free Russian 
fuel for Ukraine," the deputy chairman of the State Committee 
for the use of Nuclear Power is convinced. "Even if Russia 
sells the fuel produced from our uranium at a cheaper price, 
Ukrainian atomic power stations will hardly be able to acquire 
it in sufficient quantities, because nuclear power stations are 
currently in dire financial straits."

  [Text] Dnepropetrovsk regional organizations of the Party 
of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine and the New Ukraine association 
have adopted a joint declaration in support of the tripartite 
Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian agreements on nuclear weapons. The 
declaration points out that courageous and resolute steps should 
be taken to save Ukraine's economy, including those in foreign 
economic and diplomatic spheres. Leonid Kravchuk's actions, 
although a little too late, give some hope for the improvement 
of economic indicators as a result of a decrease in expenditures 
on maintenance of nuclear arms. On the other hand, an urgent 
need for Ukraine's domestic economic reform has become even more 
evident. The road to the world community has opened before 
Ukraine, but to set out upon it, Ukraine must prove to its own 
people its loyalty to progress, market principles, well-being, 
and prosperity. 
  Sergey Mikhaylenko, leader of the regional organizations of 
the two parties, who has been nominated candidate in 
Dnepropetrovsk electoral district No. 76, underlined that 
fidelity to economic reform will be the distinctive feature of 
the centrist forces' electoral platform. In particular, four 
principles represent the epitome of S. Mikhaylenko's electoral 
program: Priority of human rights, the curbing of inflation, 
reform in the system of ownership, and increased independence of 
regions.

  [Text] "Ukraine's territorial integrity is fixed in all 
documents and we shall never give it up," Ivan Plyushch, speaker 
of the republic's parliament, said in a radio interview. 
  He said that today there are no countries which have 
territorial claims to Ukraine, as was made by the Russian 
parliament. 
  The speaker believes that the territorial claims could be 
associated with the election of Yuriy Meshkov as the Crimean 
president. However, he said, now Russian-Ukrainian relations 
have no grounds for fears. 
  Plyushch has described as artificial the problem of 
Ukrainian 
debts to Russia. He believes the problem is blown up by 
pro-imperial forces in Russia who rely on a strong propaganda 
machine. Plyushch believes that Russia could place some of its 
debts as legal successor of the Soviet Union on Ukraine. In 
addition, not only the Black Sea Fleet, but the entire former 
Soviet navy should be divided, he said. 
  Plyushch said that following the trilateral statement on 
Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, the United States promised to set 
aside for the republic some $500 million for dismantling nuclear 
weapons.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in 
Ukrainian at 1400 GMT on 5 February begins broadcasting a live 
phone-in program with Ivan Plyushch, chairman of Ukraine's 
Supreme Council. 
  The program begins with Plyushch answering several questions 
of a personal nature. He says that he is a self-critical 
person, that his Ukrainian, although often criticized as being 
far from literary, is the language spoken by ordinary people and 
there is nothing wrong with a statesman speaking this language, 
and that playing card games is his hobby. 
  Replying to a question from a program moderator on the cause 
of the deep economic crisis that hit Ukraine despite the fact 
that it was considered to have the greatest potential of all the 
former USSR countries, Ivan Plyushch says that this is nothing 
but a misconception. Ukraine did have better economic potential 
but not starting opportunities, which are a different matter, he 
says. The coal and ore mining enterprises in the Donetsk coal 
basin and Krivoy Rog basin were supposed to be cost-effective 
within the framework of the Warsaw Treaty organization but now 
they are a burden for Ukraine. The Chernobyl disaster and the 
huge army with the military and industrial complex should be 
added to this, he states. These three factors consume one third 
of Ukraine's budget. "Do we need such an army?" he asks. "We 
started from almost 1 million. Now we have already reduced it 
down to half a million, on paper. But today we pay more to the 
pensioners, who had once been wearing shoulder straps, than to 
maintain regular servicemen," he says. 
  Answering a question from a listener from New York Plyushch 
points out that no help from the outside can lead a country as 
big as Ukraine out of the crisis. The only way out is to ensure 
conditions enabling the people of Ukraine to work efficiently 
and fruitfully, he states. He admits that the parliament does 
more toward solving political issues rather than economic. 
Plyushch blames the government for introducing too many 
amendments to the legislation worked out by the parliament, 
which only steps up chaos. He says that the current parliament 
is still to adopt the law on the election of local councils, in 
compliance with the law on the formation of the local power 
bodies and regional self-government, and the law on the election 
of the president. Both elections are scheduled to take place 
simultaneously in June 1994. "Besides, consultations are under 
way with the government and the president on introducing 
amendments and additions to the current legislation in February, 
which would not hamper, not stand in the way of the economic 
reforms, but, on the contrary, which would open up the way for 
economic reforms," he states. 
  Answering a question from a listener from the Netherlands, 
Plyushch says: "There are no countries encroaching upon 
Ukraine's territorial integrity, except for the already 
nonexistent parliament of the Russian Federation, which made a 
notorious decision on Sevastopol that was condemned by the world 
public and by such a structure as the UN Security Council. To a 
certain extent one can link the election of Meshkov, president 
of the Crimea, with the encroachments of the Russian 
pro-imperial forces. However, in our policy and practical 
actions we must proceed from interstate bilateral relations. At 
present, we have such relations, which give us no grounds to 
assert this. In addition, you know that in the latest 
trilateral statement by Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and Clinton the sides 
declare that they will not make territorial claims. Moreover, 
they will not interfere in the internal affairs and, on the 
contrary, will do everything to ensure territorial integrity, 
noninterference, and collective security." 
  In his reply to a listener from Bavaria, Germany, who 
expresses his dissatisfaction with the dominance of the Russian 
language in Ukraine and the encroachment on Ukraine's 
sovereignty, Plyushch says that the law on languages was adopted 
in Ukraine. However the consolidation of Ukrainian as the state 
language needs time and money, he says. Plyushch also remarks 
that 149 countries have recognized Ukraine and diplomatic 
relations have been established with 133 countries. Ukrainian 
diplomatic representations are functioning in more than 40 
countries. This means that Ukraine has consolidated its status 
as a member of the European and world communities, he states. 
  In his reply to a listener from Australia who wants to know 
what prompted Plyushch to write his book Who Are We And 
Where Are We Going?, he says that this is a collection of 
his speeches made over the past four years, published with the 
sponsorship of the Soros Foundation. Ivan Plyushch says the 
contents of all his speeches prove the invariability of his 
stand and adherence to the ideas of democracy, glasnost, market 
economy, Ukraine's sovereignty, and independence. 
  The program moderator asks Plyushch about his attitude 
toward 
such economists as Lanovyy, Pynzenyk, Pylypchuk, and Chernyak, 
who are well known in Ukraine as proponents of market economy 
and whose economic programs, however, were turned down. The 
parliament speaker says he always respected the above economists 
and respects them now, but they would never be a success unless 
there was a unity of actions and a consensus between the 
proponents of the market economy and those who stand on the 
principles of administration-by-mere injunction. 
  In his reply to a listener from the United States concerning 
the necessity of a spiritual revolution, Plyushch says that the 
government's support for science and education is insufficient. 
The trilateral statement, signed by Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and 
Clinton, envisages $500,000 in aid to Ukraine. This will help 
Ukraine solve at least some of its problems. He says: "This is 
why the parliament did it right when it ratified START I and 
allowed the government to exchange the instruments of 
ratification and conclude direct agreements in fulfilment of all 
the reservations put forth by the Supreme Council." 
  Concerning the issue of dual citizenship, touched upon by a 
listener from Great Britain, Plyushch says that issues of dual 
citizenship are considered in every individual case on a 
bilateral basis. 
  The program moderator asks Plyushch about his attitude 
toward 
the economic union within the CIS. He also adds that Plyushch 
was once against such a union and since then Ukraine has become 
its associate member. Plyushch says: "I am not against the 
economic union, and you, please, never say this again anywhere." 
"I was saying an absolutely different thing. I was saying that 
our country is a CIS member. We have already concluded more 
than 400 various treaties and agreements and none of these 
works. So, what kind of a union do you need?" He adds: "Who 
stands in the way of their fulfillment? Who is talking about 
some new economic union, some new agreements? Let him not 
deceive anyone. What I have in mind is this: It is necessary 
either to set up such a structure that would force the 
fulfillment of those agreements or they must be fulfilled on a 
bilateral, mutually advantageous basis." 
  Concerning the results of the work done by the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, Plyushch says it 
is too early to speak about any results, although the good 
intentions of the Black Sea basin countries to solve their 
problems jointly is a positive result in itself. Answering a 
question from the moderator whether Turkey allowed the passage 
of oil tankers to Ukraine through the Bosporus, Plyushch says: 
"Turkey has never refused to do this. That was just an intrigue 
by our wire-pullers." 
  In his reply to a listener from the United States concerning 
the division of the former USSR assets, Plyushch indicates that 
Ukraine had not received anything so far. On its part Ukraine 
also failed to pay off its share of the former USSR debt. He 
says: "There is an agreement at the level of governments that 
the tactical nuclear weapons, which were withdrawn from Ukraine, 
the cost of the uranium in those weapons, will be counted to 
settle Ukraine's share of the former USSR debt." 
  Concerning Ukraine's security, Plyushch says that Ukraine is 
a member of all the international institutions and structures 
dealing with collective security. He expresses certainty that 
the trilateral statement, signed by Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and 
Clinton in Moscow, should contribute to consolidating Ukraine's 
security. 
  Answering a question from a listener in Kiev concerning the 
internal debt of Ukraine's government due to the USSR 
disintegration, Plyushch confirms that the government of Ukraine 
must compensate for the bonds and other securities of the former 
USSR possessed by Ukrainian citizens. 
  Concerning the upcoming parliamentary election in Ukraine, 
the parliament speaker expresses his strong conviction that the 
election will take place without fail. At present 1,612 
candidates for deputies are registered in Ukraine of whom 927 
were nominated by electors, 500 by working collectives, and only 
183 by political parties. Plyushch says that this is the result 
of the fact that the parties pursue, first and foremost, their 
own selfish, narrow-party, group interests. This is why their 
members continue to say that the election will fail to take 
place. 
  Answering a listener's question concerning the reliability 
of 
the trilateral statement signed in Moscow, Plyushch says: "I 
believe that the president of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, made a 
decisive, bold, and the only correct move when he signed the 
trilateral agreement and its appendix. Today this is not only 
my own opinion but the opinion of the 260 deputies who endorsed 
this move with their votes. President Kravchuk was acting in 
line with the reservations that had been made by the Supreme 
Council on 18 November last year during the ratification." 
  Plyushch welcomes the ever-growing activity and 
participation 
of the new business representatives in the election campaign but 
remarks that this refers to honest businessmen, not those who 
make their money by plundering the national wealth. 
  Concerning the issue of privatization, touched upon by a 
listener from Belgium, Plyushch says privatization in Ukraine is 
backed up by a whole number of relevant laws. However, it is 
hampered by the absence of those wishing to privatize property 
and lack of finances. 
  Touching on the issue of building an oil terminal in Odessa, 
raised by the program moderator, Plyushch says that today 
Ukraine imports 90 percent of its oil. It would be unwise to 
have only one source for the oil supply. This is why it is 
necessary to have alternative sources. Even without the 
terminal, which is being built in Odessa, Ukraine is already now 
prepared to receive up to 5 million tons of oil. As for the 
extraction of oil in Ukraine, experts say it can be increased up 
to 10 million tons, but this will not be enough anyway, because 
Ukraine needs at least 40 million tons. 
  Answering a question from a listener from Great Britain 
concerning the fact that Kazakhstan is not in a hurry to 
eliminate its nuclear weapons while Ukraine is eliminating 
theirs, Plyushch says that in its declaration Ukraine pledged to 
be a nonnuclear and nonaligned state. The nuclear weapons, 
inherited by Ukraine from the former USSR, can be neither used, 
maintained, nor modernized by Ukraine. "Besides, in the future 
Ukraine is to become a nonnuclear state. It will accede to the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty. More than 130 countries have 
already acceded to it and 180 countries, as far as I know, 
intend to accede to it. We will be a peace-loving state," 
Plyushch says. 
  Dwelling on the issue of mutual settlements between Ukraine 
and Russia raised by a listener from Belgium, Plyushch admits 
that the balance of payments today is not in favor of Ukraine. 
"We are far from covering the cost of the power sources, 
received from Russia, by our products exported to Russia," he 
states. 
  Concerning the issue of borders between Ukraine and Russia, 
raised by the same listener, Plyushch says that it would take 
time to built genuine borders. 
  To conclude the question-and-answer session, Plyushch says 
that foreign observers are expected to take part in the coming 
parliamentary election in Ukraine. The program ends at 1530 GMT.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 7 February a UNIAN correspondent learned 
from reliable sources that the cabinet of ministers and the 
National Bank of Ukraine will in the very near future approve a 
joint resolution to emerge from the nonpayments crisis between 
Ukraine's corporate bodies. Since 1 December 1993 their 
receiveables have grown from 46 to 78 trillion karbovantsi. 
  At a meeting of the Presidium of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [USPP] on 4 February, Ukrainian 
Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov stated: Since the 
movement of payments has almost halted, "the state's financial 
and monetary system is paralyzed" and "industry is low." In his 
words, it was decided that there would be considerable financial 
"injections" in the economy. The government convinced Ukrainian 
Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch of the need for this 
move. It is now being coordinated what the plan for this will 
be; whether it will be done through index-linking of working 
capital or through emission. Vasyl Yevtukhov said he and Deputy 
Prime Ministers Valeriy Shmarov and Volodymyr Demyanov estimated 
that the total sum of money required was several tens of 
trillions of karbovantsi. 
  In order to set monetary circulation in motion, the USPP 
proposed "to determine the karbovantsi sum that would ensure the 
first round of payments in goods manufacturing and banking and 
to channel it to restoring the production cycle. To do this, 
mandatory mutual offsetting of enterprises' debts through 
settlement by promissory notes via relevant banks should be 
carried out; the enterprises with a negative balance after 
mutual offsetting by promissory notes should be identified; 
priorities in the structure of the national produce should be 
set; the range of enterprises that have the right to state 
credits should be determined; and credits to sectors of the 
national economy should be prohibited legislatively by the 
Ukrainian president's edict. Should monetary emission be 
necessary in order to grant state credits to specific 
enterprises, it should be carried out." 
  The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has decided that credits 
should be granted to separate sectors along the technological 
line: By granting credits to the metallurgy and the coking 
by-product industry, the government will enable them to settle 
their accounts with the coal miners and the coal miners in their 
turn will settle theirs with the power engineers etc. At the 
same time, it is providing funds subject to produce in real 
terms, rather than granting purely emissive credit, that is at 
issue. According to some data, the government will make 
ministries' and departments' primary officials personally 
responsible for returning the money. In Vasyl Yevtukhov's words, 
this scheme of credit provision requires 7-15 trillion 
karbovantsi, which is two times less than the sum that was 
discussed previously. Separate on the list is the agro- 
industrial complex, which requires 3-4 trillion karbovantsi. 
  In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent, acting 
Ukrainian Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy confirmed that "the 
problem of offsetting mutual indebtedness should be tackled 
positively and immediately." He at the same time was 
categorical in denying claims that this would lead to 
considerable emission, since credits, in his words, will be 
granted "exclusively subject to the finished produce." Asked by 
a UNIAN correspondent to comment on expert estimates forecasting 
initial emission to the amount of five trillion karbovantsi, the 
Ukrainian acting prime minister said: "No businessman will ever 
see such an emission in Ukraine." 
  Ukrainian Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko told a 
UNIAN 
correspondent: "Better emission, or to be more precise, 
emissive credit, than mutual offsetting. The offsetting of 
mutual indebtedness will take one and a half to two months, 
while we need radical and prompt measures to increase the 
viability of industry. At present there is a disaster in every 
sector." 
  Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, USPP Chairman Leonid 
Kuchma pointed out that the financial system could be unblocked 
by interbank promissory note offsetting, which would identify 
bankrupt enterprises. He spoke categorically against 
automatically offsetting mutual debts. According to the latest 
information, however, the government has rejected this USPP 
proposal, since the banks are inexperienced in working with 
promissory notes. 
  Asked by a UNIAN correspondent about how well-grounded talk 
of emission was, Ukrainian Economy Minister Roman Shpek at his 
news conference on 4 February answered: "We shall seek to settle 
the issues of the budget deficit in the first quarter -- and I 
cannot be sure that there will not be any in the second one as 
well -- on a non-emission basis. This was one of the subjects 
of the talks by the Ukrainian Government delegation in the 
United States. The submission of annual financial reports by 
enterprises is a convenient time for enterprises to be cleared 
up. Address or point assistance will only be given to those who 
are the foundation of our export potential." 
  Roman Shpek also said that delegations from the 
International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank are coming to Ukraine next 
week.

  [Text] On the eve of the elections to the Supreme Council, 
Ukraine's People's Rukh was subjected to a brutal assault -- on 
15 January 1994, the chairman of the Secretariat and cochairman 
of Rukh's Central Electoral Committee, Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, was 
abducted. His fate is still unknown -- this is the beginning of 
the appeal by Ukraine's People's Rukh to citizens. 
  The steady political pressure exerted upon Rukh, the 
information blockade imposed by the authorities, the pogroms in 
the buildings of local Rukh organizations, and the use of force 
against its activists during the election campaign have become 
systematic. 
  As is known, the activity of political parties and public 
organizations has no financial backing from the state. The law 
"On Associations of Citizens" prevents political organizations 
from engaging in political activity. Nor do they have the right 
to receive material support from their foreign supporters. 
Therefore, the parties may only act effectively if they get 
assistance from collective or individual sponsors in Ukraine, 
those who want to support a political force that will defend 
their interests. 
  The offensive against those who have rendered assistance, no 
matter how small, to Rukh, is an attempt to deprive our 
organization of support during the election campaign. 
  People's Rukh consistently pursues a policy of building a 
democracy in the independent Ukrainian state and of reforms that 
will guarantee the well-being of the people. It actively 
opposes the present corrupt authorities and promotes equality of 
all citizens before the law. 
  If we win the elections, we will form a government that will 
enjoy the confidence of the people. We are ready to take upon 
ourselves the responsibility for the fate of our state. 
  This is what our opponents in the party in power 
particularly 
fear. They have decided to leave Ukraine's People's Rukh 
without means of subsistence. 
  We appeal to you, dear friends, to support Ukraine's 
People's 
Rukh. We appeal to all those who strive for effective reforms 
in the economy, want positive changes in society, and associate 
these hopes with the People's Rukh. Your support is the pledge 
of our common victory. 
  We will gratefully accept your donations at the following 
address: 252032, Kiev, Taras Shevchenko Boulevard, 37/122 or to 
bank account No. 609893 in the Commercial Bank "INKO," MFO

  [Signed] Chairman of Ukraine's People's Rukh Vyacheslav 
Chornovil 
  [Dated] Kiev, 30 January 1994

  [Text] Managers of Ukraine's State Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Company held a conference with political party 
leaders on 7 February. The conference approved a mechanism for 
using television and radio in the election campaign. It was 
agreed that, during the period left until the election, parties 
can use 21 hours of air time on television and 10 hours on the 
radio. 
  The first stage, at which parties presented their election 
programs, is over. At the second stage, electors will be 
informed in detail about the goals of political parties and 
movements. It was agreed that these broadcasts will take the 
format of a debate, involving only those party representatives 
who are not registered as candidates for people's deputy of 
Ukraine. 
  A proposal on panel composition put forward by State 
Television and Radio Broadcasting Company president Mykola 
Okhmakevych's was strongly disputed. In the party leaders' 
opinion, they are capable of choosing their opponents themselves 
without waiting for journalists to do so. It was decided that 
topics for the debates will be suggested by sociological surveys. 
  Chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz 
suggested that conference participants refrain from commenting 
on the election results in Crimea for the sake of national 
concord.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Verbych: "Nationalist Ideas and Elections"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Delegates from most of the oblast's rayons 
arrived for a conference of the Volyn branch of the Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN]. Representatives of parties and 
civil unions which are members of the Prosperity, Justice, and 
Order bloc also participated in the conference. 
  Serhiy Hodlevskyy, a member of the oblast branch of KUN, 
presented to the participants an electoral platform of 
nationalists entitled "Ukrainian Choice -- 94." In particular, 
the document says that "the Ukrainian state faces a deadly 
threat today." It also appeals for consolidation of all social 
forces which support the national and state interests of 
Ukraine. The platform also demands that officials who are 
responsible for massive pilferage of national property and 
bribery be brought to account. The document proclaims a 
ceaseless war against nomenklatura and Mafia structures. KUN 
will also fight against those forces which advocate racist, 
chauvinist, imperial, and communist ideas. Admitting the 
necessity of privatization and the establishment of a middle 
class, KUN will resist unfair privatization [prykhvatyzatsiya -- 
relates to Supreme Chairman Plyushch's mispronunciation of the 
word "pryvatyzatsiya"]. Ukraine's nuclear potential is 
considered an essential security guarantee. KUN's legislative 
candidates base their positions on such values as the 
individual, family, nation, and state. 
  Meletiy Semenyuk, head of the oblast branch of KUN and head 
of the Volyn branch of the Brotherhood of Ukrainian Insurrection 
Army Troops, analyzed the current sociopolitical situation. 
Speaking about prospects for state building, he emphasized that 
"nobody will build our state except we ourselves." Special 
attention was paid to the necessity of preserving unshaken 
spirits and allegiance to the ideas of the Organization of 
Ukrainian Nationalists [OUN] and the Ukrainian Insurrection Army 
[UPA]. 
  Meletiy Semenyuk condemned the dissemination of leaflets 
signed in the name of "inheritors of national patriotism." In 
particular, one of the leaflets signed by mythical political 
leader "Lebed" and strategist-analyst "Uchytel," deputy 
centurion of the Volyn Security Century, says: "We call on 
professional racketeers, whose hands have not yet been soiled 
with blood, to join the Brotherhood of OUN-UPA Troops..." M. 
Semenyuk believes that activities of the so-called "inheritors 
of national patriotism" are aimed at bringing discredit upon the 
Brotherhood of UPA Troops and KUN. "We will not allow them to 
discredit our movement," he stated, appealing to law enforcement 
authorities for investigating those structures which are hidden 
behind the "inheritors of national patriotism." [passage omitted]

  [Text] One of the Russian prime minister's aides has 
offered his resignation. 
  Andrey Illarionov, head of the prime minister's analysis and 
planning group, in his letter of resignation to Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, a copy of which has been obtained by 
Interfax, says, among other things: "The approved present 
composition of the government and the decisions which it is 
drawing up (primarily those providing for huge benefits for the 
agro-industrial and fuel and energy complexes and on the 
unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus), as 
well as public statements made by the premier make it clear that 
the radical change in the economic policy started more than a 
year ago is now complete." 
  In Illarionov's opinion, the present government has 
effectively begun to restore former economic and political 
practices. "Having gotten on their knees before lobbyists from 
various industries and regions and giving in to their blackmail, 
it will continue to meet their interests and bolster its own 
power. Taking part in such activities contradicts my 
convictions," the aide says. 
  "You are better aware than anyone else of the economic and 
political damage done over the past year and a half to the 
people of Russia and its president by the chairman of the 
Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko. Recently you promised 
comprehensive support to Gerashchenko. It is perfectly clear 
that defending Gerashchenko is your position, with which I can 
have nothing to do," Illarionov says, addressing Chernomyrdin. 
  "I cannot remain head of your analysis and planning group 
because I came to the government to carry out economic reforms, 
not to ditch them. I cannot remain in this post because I have 
always been trying to defend the national interests of Russia 
rather than those of a handful of collective-farm and state-farm 
barons or generals from the fuel and energy complex. I cannot 
remain in this post because I take a negative attitude to most 
of the decisions you take and because I have to publicly explain 
how harmful they are to Russia," Illarionov says.

  [Text] Nikolay Medvedev, head of the directorate in the 
Russian president's administration in charge of dealing with 
regions, believes that the task of establishing a presidential 
party is a topical issue. In his opinion, the party will play 
its part in the presidential elections in 1996 and help the 
voters to make up their minds. 
  Medvedev said that President Boris Yeltsin is ready to form 
the party, and that the initiative has already brought about a 
response. 
  An organizing committee of the Russian Presidential Party of 
Reformers has already been set up in the Siberian city of 
Irkutsk. The committee has proposed that the revival of the 
country, the integration with the international community, 
democracy, commitment to solving internal and external problems 
by peaceful means, as well as to private ownership and 
enterprise should be proclaimed as the new party's main 
principles and tasks.

  [Text] St. Petersburg February 8 TASS -- A regional 
conference of the Communist Party of Russian Federation was held 
here in an atmosphere of conspiracy, well-informed source told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  According to the same source, Russian communist leader 
Gennadiy Zyuganov told the conference his party will not join 
any coalition, and will run on its own in the elections to the 
local governments. 
  This declaration met with a mixed reaction on the part of 
some district party organizations that insist on forming a bloc 
with the electoral coalition Rodina (Fatherland), with which 
other communist organisations of St. Petersburg are allied. 
  Yuriy Belov has been elected head of the St. Petersburg 
regional Communist Party committee. He accumulated vast 
experience of work in the party apparat in the Soviet era when 
the country was dominated by a single-party system.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.A. Kruglov, prosecutor of Administration </F>
for Supervision of Implementation of Laws on Federal Security 
and Interethnic Relations of Russian General Prosecutor's 
Office, by Sergey Kaverin; place and date not given: "Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy Might Be Arrested"] 
  [Text] While V. Zhirinovskiy, Russia's chief liberal, was 
traveling around Europe making fiery speeches and generous 
promises, the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office was 
actively drawing up a criminal case against him. V. Kruglov, 
prosecutor of the Administration for Supervision of 
Implementation of Laws on Federal Security and Interethnic 
Relations of the Russian General Prosecutor's Office, gives the 
details on this topic. 
  [Kaverin] Viktor Alekseyevich, does it not seem to you that 
the institution of criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy is 
a kind of act of vengeance by the pro-government forces which 
lost to him? 
  [Kruglov] Certainly not. Interestingly, our administration 
and I personally tackled Zhirinovskiy quite a long time ago, but 
Vladimir Volfovich committed his main "transgressions" precisely 
on the eve of the elections. The grounds for instituting 
criminal proceedings were provided by such points as the 
arbitration tribunal's well-known 10 December decision and the 
incident which occurred between Zhirinovskiy and Gdlyan in the 
Kremlin Palace of Congresses on the night of 12-13 December. 
The latest episode was the book The Last Dash to the 
South, published by Zhirinovskiy. All these facts were 
examined by us as a package, and on their basis criminal 
proceedings were instituted under Article 71 of the Russian 
Federation Criminal Code -- "war propaganda." The decision to 
institute criminal proceedings was adopted at the level of the 
leadership of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office. 
  [Kaverin] What steps will be taken in respect of 
Zhirinovskiy after his return from abroad? 
  [Kruglov] First of all, the general prosecutor must decide 
who will investigate the criminal case which has been instituted 
and appoint the specific investigator and subdepartment. Then 
this subdepartment will begin directly conducting the 
investigation, naturally resolving the questions that arise 
within the framework of the law. The mechanism for conducting 
such an investigation is known: summonses, interrogations. The 
investigation will be conducted in full as an investigation into 
an ordinary criminal case. 
  [Kaverin] As far as I know, this is something new in 
jurisdiction relating to relations between law-enforcement 
organs and deputies, is it not? 
  [Kruglov] Yes, it is. In accordance with the new Russian 
Federation Constitution, the status of a Russian Federation 
State Duma deputy is no obstacle to the institution and 
investigation of a criminal case. The Constitution stipulates 
perfectly unequivocally and clearly that the State Duma's 
consent is required only for the arrest of a deputy, his search, 
and (or) his detention. I repeat: arrest, search, and 
detention. That is, a criminal case in respect of a deputy is 
instituted and investigated on generally applicable grounds; and 
with regard to the investigation, if grounds arise for a search, 
detention, or arrest, the general prosecutor petitions the State 
Duma for a particular deputy to be stripped of his immunity on 
the grounds of the investigation results submitted. I will 
remind you that previously, in accordance with the Constitution 
in force then, the Supreme Soviet had to ask permission to 
actually institute criminal proceedings against a deputy. 
  [Kaverin] What threatens Zhirinovskiy in accordance with 
the new Constitution and the laws if he does not answer the 
summons? Knowing Vladimir Volfovich, it is not hard to imagine 
the reality of such a development of events. 
  [Kruglov] At present Zhirinovskiy is formally considered a 
witness and is obliged by law to appear in order to testify. 
Juridically he is considered a witness until the moment he is 
charged. Therefore at first he will be summoned precisely as a 
witness. If he does not come, the investigator will be forced 
to react. How? In the event of a failure to appear without 
valid reason, an ordinary citizen is threatened with arrest 
[privod], which is carried out by militia organs. But this is 
an element of coercion and therefore can be qualified 
essentially as detention -- one of the three points (!) on which 
a deputy enjoys immunity. 
  [Kaverin] You end up with a vicious circle: In order to 
arrest a deputy who is at fault, weighty grounds and, 
consequently, the State Duma's "go-ahead" are needed. In order 
to secure this "go-ahead," the Duma needs facts which the 
investigation cannot obtain from the "undisciplined" deputy.... 
  [Kruglov] This is partly true. But take into account the 
fact that any criminal case is built not only on the testimony 
alone of the person under investigation. There must also be 
some other studies, materials, witnesses' testimonies, and data 
from expert appraisals. In principle, therefore, a sufficient 
quantity of proof can be gathered against an "evasive deputy" to 
charge him even without his "participation." I wish to repeat 
once again that all the aforesaid is of a purely theoretical 
nature, and specific questions in respect of a specific accused 
will be decided by the investigator who, according to the law, 
investigates this case and independently adopts decisions. 
  [Kaverin] Viktor Alekseyevich, how long, in your opinion, 
will this investigation last? 
  [Kruglov] I do not know. This is a complex question. It 
depends on a huge number of circumstances.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Baturin, security adviser to the </F>
Russian president, by unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given: "We Remain a Great Power"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, the radical 
reformer Gaydar has resigned, society is becoming increasingly 
polarized, and the West is voicing growing doubts about 
Yeltsin's ability to see reforms through. What consequences 
does all this have for Russia's stability? 
  [Baturin] Unfortunately, people such as Gaydar and Finance 
Minister Fedorov have become the sole symbols of reform. Their 
departure is then promptly interpreted as signifying danger, as 
meaning that reforms will be halted. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Following this latest government reshuffle, 
the West is already preparing itself for a standstill and 
hyperinflation.... 
  [Baturin] I know, but, under the new Constitution, only the 
president can set the basic directions of domestic and foreign 
policy. The government just implements his will. In the second 
half of February, when Boris Yeltsin presents his state of the 
nation report to parliament, we will see whether he is still 
serious about reform. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Yeltsin's closest allies are accusing Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin of having already staged an "economic 
coup" and are predicting mass uprisings and chaos in the spring. 
  [Baturin] I do not want to say that we are now on a certain 
course regarding economic policy. But I would be against seeing 
things in excessively dramatic terms. One has to let the new 
government start work before one tell whether it is promising 
more than it can accomplish. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What advice would you offer the president? 
  [Baturin] As security adviser, it is my task to predict what 
kind of course of developments would spell danger for Russia. 
The population was positively disposed toward the reformers 
around Gaydar over a long period of time. In April, a majority 
voted in favor of their economic policies. However, shock 
therapy -- the lifting of controls on prices and the scarcity of 
money -- led to great dissatisfaction in the meantime. The 
result of the December parliamentary elections was the check. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There are about 70,000 unprofitable plants in 
Russia, but only eight filed for bankruptcy last year. What is 
the shock about? 
  [Baturin] You may see things that way. For someone who is 
fit, it is not hard to jump out of a third story window -- he 
will just get up and carry on running. For someone who is not 
in shape, jumping off a chair can be fatal. Many plants have 
not paid their employees' wages for months now. Relatively few 
are well off. On the other hand, there are millions who are 
living below the poverty line -- is that not a shock? These are 
the very people who determine what happens at the ballot box. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So there will be no adjustments to the basic 
policy course? 
  [Baturin] Policy must be adjusted by introducing social 
buffers. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] New presents of loans for bankrupt enterprises 
will push up inflation dramatically. 
  [Baturin] Inflation might go up, but that does not have to 
lead to catastrophe right away. The same thing might have 
happened with Gaydar and Fedorov, and who knows on what scale. 
Besides, if the government departs from the president's policy 
course too much, Boris Yeltsin will make adjustments -- I am 
certain that he is capable of that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Who actually decides what is good for Russia's 
security: the president, who is equipped with totalitarian 
powers, the Security Council, or the new parliament? 
  [Baturin] What do you mean by totalitarian? There is a 
clear distinction between the powers of the president and of 
parliament. The Security Commission at the federal council level 
and the Duma can make proposals and thus shape national security 
concepts. Decisions are made by the Security Council. If there 
are any doubts, the president has the last word. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The president has an enormous apparatus that 
shields him. 
  [Baturin] Yeltsin's administration really is too big, and 
that hinders effective work. The team of advisers -- there are 
five of us -- is much smaller. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In Belarus, the ex-Communists have brought 
down the head of parliament and are advocating union with 
Moscow. In the Crimea, a Russian nationalist who has been give 
the title of president promises union with the old motherland. 
Will the old union be re-established? 
  [Baturin] The Soviet Union collapsed overnight. However, 
the economic, cultural, and human ties that existed have not 
been broken. It is like an elastic band, it you stretch it too 
much, it suddenly contracts. For economic reasons alone, there 
had to be a turnaround in the republics. However, there will be 
no Soviet Union again. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But a new association led by Russia? 
  [Baturin] Russia is the most powerful republic and is 
economically in a better position than the rest, which means 
that it acts like a magnet. As the situation in our country 
becomes more stable, the former republics will rally round us 
all the more. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Russian president in Simferopol wants to 
hand over the entire Crimea immediately. 
  [Baturin] We have to be very careful. Every rash act can 
revive political tensions between Russia and Ukraine. That is 
something that we should not promote. Of course, every people 
has the right to express its will. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Recently, Foreign Minister Kozyrev has been 
repeatedly calling for understanding to be shown for Russia's 
"special role" on the territory of the former USSR. What does 
this "special role" entail? 
  [Baturin] In the former Soviet republics, there are a great 
many people who still feel that they are citizens of Russia.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The figure that is cited is 25 million.... 
  [Baturin] It's about that. There is no comparable situation 
in international relations. To tell these people now that 
history has caught them out, that they no longer belong to us, 
would be morally unacceptable. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, the "special role" is a modest way of 
expressing great power politics? 
  [Baturin] If Russia sees itself as a great power, then it 
must take care of the "Russians abroad." The United States 
already views Russia as a developing country. That might be 
true from the economic angle. However, in the past we were also 
never leaders in world markets, but were still considered a 
great power. Why was that? Because everyone was afraid of a 
country that was full of nuclear weapons and had an enormous 
army. 
  Now the West is afraid that the collapse of the Union will 
produce an explosion that will make itself felt in Europe or in 
other parts of the world too. So, according to that criterion, 
we are still a great power. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Those sorts of views have turned the Baltic 
states, where you see the Russians as being discriminated 
against, against you. 
  [Baturin] There must a tough reaction to tough action.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You mean stopping the withdrawal of your 
troops? 
  [Baturin] A great power cannot duck for cover every time, 
that is not the way for a great power to behave. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Yeltsin has welcomed the NATO "Partnership for 
Peace." Will that kind of cooperation not just boost support 
for nationalists such as Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Baturin] One cannot exclude the possibility that they will 
get more wind in their sails as a result. Besides, Yeltsin did 
not "welcome" this kind of cooperation with NATO. He expressed 
himself in a rather more restrained manner. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In the Army, the number of votes cast for 
Zhirinovskiy was particularly high. How would you interpret 
that warning sign? 
  [Baturin] It was a protest. If there had been reformers who 
could sell themselves as well as Zhirinovskiy, then the result 
would have been different. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your tasks include the reform of the state 
security service. What is to remain of the old KGB? 
  [Baturin] In the new Russia, there should be no more 
political persecution, no campaigns against those who think 
differently, and no ideological uniformity imposed by force. In 
reforming the Security Ministry, we have disbanded the 
departments that operated in those areas. We are now forming a 
civilized counterintelligence service. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But the security service generals have doubts 
about your competence. Are you not afraid that you will fail in 
the same way as Vadim Bakatin, whom Gorbachev charged with 
reforming the KGB? 
  [Baturin] If I was not afraid, then that is precisely what 
would happen. I have to be more cautious than Bakatin. The new 
office of security adviser marks the beginning of civilian 
control over Russia's Army and security structures. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Zhirinovskiy talks of a clean bill of health 
that was apparently issued to him by the KGB. When will the 
Lubjanka archives be finally opened and the files made available 
to everyone? 
  [Baturin] I hope that will happen. It is undoubtedly a very 
sensitive issue, one that affects the interests of a great many 
people. One must find mechanisms that will enable one to start 
on this kind of treatment of history in a relatively painless 
manner.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Split in PRAVDA"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Aleksandr Ilin spent his first day as 
newly elected editor in chief of PRAVDA. 
  The ousted Viktor Linnik, former PRAVDA editor in chief, 
told 
your MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent in a telephone 
interview that yesterday a meeting of the editorial board was 
held under Ilin's chairmanship to discuss the newspaper's 
future. The new editor in chief formed a new lineup of the 
editorial board. A number of Viktor Linnik's loyalists, who 
were offered jobs on PRAVDA's new board, categorically rejected 
the offer. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS already reported on Sunday 
that Linnik and a part of the newspaper's staff think the 
general meeting's decision on leadership change to be unlawful, 
because the meeting was attended by less than half of the 
newspaper's staffers. 
  For the time being, however, there is dual power reigning in 
the publication. Both Linnik and Ilin continue to occupy their 
former offices -- the former, the editor in chief's; the latter, 
the deputy editor's. According to Ilin, from now on, thanks to 
straightening out the conflict with Steel Light Holding, a Greek 
company, the newspaper will be published daily. By the time 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS was signed into press, however, no order 
to print PRAVDA had been given to the Pressa publishing house's 
printing shops.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- The Russian Government is 
determined to cut the inflation rate to 7-9 percent and the 
state budget deficit to 7-7.5 percent of the Gross Domestic 
Product by the end of this year, according to Economics Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin. He was speaking at the congress "reality and 
prospects for the development of the economy in Russia, which is 
being held in Moscow within the framework of the international 
forum "wold experience and the Russian economy". 
  Shokhin said the government's priorities this year include 
financial stabilization, combatting inflation and toughening the 
tax and financial discipline. With this in mind the government 
plans to cut budget spending and encourage effective use of 
budgetary resources. 
  According to Aleksandr Shokhin, any projects that require 
funding from the budget, will be first examined by experts to 
see if they meet stringent international standards. Any 
benefits provided by the state must be fully and comprehensively 
accounted for by the recipient enterprises in reports on their 
activity and financial incomes of their leaders. Shokhin said 
this approach will increase the revenue. Last year's revenue 
reached 65-70 percent of the plan. This year's target is 80 
percent.

  [Text] In December of 1993 the average wages in Russia were 
eight times higher compared to December, 1992, while prices rose 
almost ten-fold. This is stated in a report on the situation in 
the social and labor area prepared by experts from Russia's 
Labor Ministry. The report was forwarded to Interfax. 
  According to the report, in 1993 the gap between people's 
wages widened considerably. For example, the average salaries 
of the highest-paid officials (10% of the work force) 
were 27 
times higher than the wages of low-paid workers who make up the 
same percentage. 
  At a number of facilities directors' salaries were 12 to 15 
times higher than the wages of their employees. 
  According to the report, the growth of salaries lost any 
connection with the final results of production. "The dynamics 
of price increases are a decisive factor in this process," the 
document points out. 
  The wages of about one half of government employees continue 
to remain below subsistence minimum, the report says.

<F P=106> [Tatyana Khudyakova report: "Incomes Rise But So Does </F>
Number of Poor People"] 
  [Text] The Labor Ministry has summarized some results of 
the year of 1993, just ended, and has categorized as 
achievements the stabilization of Russians' living standards and 
the nonappearance of mass unemployment. 
  However great the temptation, we must nonetheless not be too 
quick to rejoice. According to official data published by the 
same Labor Ministry, last year the population's money incomes 
increased 9 percent. Evidently the incomes only of the section 
of the population whose incomes are 27 times higher than those 
of the lowest paid people. 
  The main bulk of Russians (77 percent) had incomes lower 
than 
double the subsistence wage, which was 50,000 rubles [R] in 
December. One-third of this number were below even the 
subsistence wage. According to an expert assessment about 13 
percent of people on low incomes were frankly suffering from 
malnutrition. 
  If it is considered that things are no worse than in 1992, 
that means that a certain stabilization of incomes is taking 
place. Although specialists claim that new paupers have appeared 
in Russia. They are citizens who are perfectly able to work but 
whose incomes do not sustain any sort of life, since they are 
below the subsistence wage. 
  The labor market situation looks like the calm before the 
storm. Official unemployment continues to be negligible and 
does not exceed 1 percent of the number of employed people. But 
so-called hidden unemployment is increasing -- according to 
various assessments, between 4 and 7 million people are not 
working full days or are on unpaid administrative leave. 
  Wages are a headache for the government. This powerful 
engine of progress has lost all sense in our country. People in 
work are not happy because by December wages had increased 700 
percent while prices had increased 900 percent. The government 
is concerned because the monthly wage increases are blatantly 
inflationary. Money is being pumped into the consumer market 
thanks to endless increases in prices for energy, transport, raw 
materials, and so on. Manpower is still cheap, but it seems 
that quantity and quality of labor will not be in demand as 
economic categories for a while yet. 
  But a new phenomenon has been discovered. The average 
industrial wage is R140,000, while the average wage in, for 
example, commercial banks is R1.5 million. That is not all. 
Leaders of enterprises, even of those which have long had one 
foot in the grave, are concluding contracts with themselves and 
setting wages that are sometimes 100 times higher than the 
average wage of workers at the same enterprise. How can this be 
combated? It is rumored that the government intends to put an 
end to this outrage but does not yet know how to do it.

<F P=106> [Report by Fedor Demchenko: "Trade Unions Set Ultimatum"] </F>
  [Text] The leaders of eight trade unions of the base 
industries have addressed a collective message to Russian 
Government head V. Chernomyrdin. The activity of the organs of 
management and the government's economic policy, the message 
says, are leading to the winding down of Russian industry, mass 
unemployment, and the further growth of social tension in labor 
collectives. 
  The tough financial and tax policy, the release of prices 
for 
energy carriers, and the drastic increase in charges for rail 
shipments have led to the point where enterprises have virtually 
no working capital left. The fines stipulated for defaulting on 
payments (over 700 percent per annum), the message stresses, are 
in excess of all sensible limits. Enterprises are obliged to 
take short-term credits at commercial banks at extortionate 
interest rates. As a result the labor collectives are being 
plunged deeper and deeper into poverty. At the same time "a 
small group of the financial oligarchy is earning gigantic 
profits." 
  Our numerous appeals to the president and government on 
problems requiring immediate solution, the message's signatories 
stress, are not meeting with a proper response. Government 
instructions, given the present turnover rate among leaders, are 
not being fulfilled. On instructions from members of the trade 
union we insist on an immediate meeting with you personally, the 
message concludes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Samara, 7 Feb -- The main aim of the working visit 
by representatives of the Russian Armed Forces command to the 
Volga Military District is to test issues concerning the 
coordination of military doctrine and practice, on the spot, and 
to study problems of military training and the stationing of 
troops. Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
stated this at a meeting in Samara with managers and officers of 
the Volga Military District. 
  Touching on the problems of Russia's Armed Forces, Pavel 
Grachev noted that the army draft was carried out in a 
reasonably organized fashion last year. Russia's Armed Forces 
currently have 60 percent of their full complement of staff. It 
is proposed that 70-75 percent of the posts in Russia's Armed 
Forces should be filled after this year's spring recruitment and 
85-90 percent by the end of the year. In the minister's 
opinion, this will enable the Russian Army to carry out the 
tasks it is faced with in guaranteeing the state's security. 
  The defense minister noted that he has prepared a 
directive on the reform of the system of educational work in the 
troops, the focus of which is to be moved to the localities. 
Touching on problems of housing Russian Army subunits withdrawn 
from abroad, Grachev noted that since 1992 270,000 servicemen, 
around 3,000 tanks, 6,000 armored vehicles, and around 1,500 
aircraft have been withdrawn onto Russian territory. In 
connection with this, providing facilities for servicemen is one 
of the most important tasks facing the Russian Defense Ministry 
today. Speaking about the reduction in the overall numbers in 
the Russian Army, the minister stated that Russia's Armed Forces 
have to be reduced to 2 million by 1 January 1995. This, 
according to him, is the limit for troop reduction. At the 
present time Russia's Armed Forces number 2,341,000. 
  Grachev also spoke of the planned transition to the 
territorial command principle. All arms of service on his 
territory should be subordinate to the district commander. In 
the minister's opinion, this should ensure that they are 
reliably controlled. Touching on the financial position of 
Russia's Armed Forces, Grachev noted that the government was in 
debt to the army to the tune of around 2.3 trillion rubles in 
1993. 
  This evening the Russian minister held a meeting with heads 
of the Samara Oblast and town administrations. Problems 
concerning social provision for the district's troops were 
discussed.

  [Text] Russia's army is to be 2 million-men-strong by 
January 1, 1995. This was declared by Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev at a meeting with the commanders and senior officers of 
the Volga Region's Military District. The meeting took place in 
Samara. 
  In Grachev's words, it is "the final figure," after which 
the 
reduction of the Russian army is to be stopped. The army 
currently has 2.34 Mn men. 
  Grachev described the last army draft as "more or less 
successful." In his words, the units are manned only at 60 
percent today. The figure is to be raised to 70-75 percent by 
the spring, and to 85-90 percent by the autumn. 
  He disclosed that Russia had withdrawn more than 270,000 
troops, 3,100 tanks, 6,000 armored vehicles, and 1,500 aircraft 
from CIS and other countries since 1992. 
  He also revealed that Russia planned to set up 28 military 
bases in CIS states. 
  The minister spoke in favor of a territorial command scheme, 
under which the headquarters of a district be responsible for 
all the armed services on their territory. In his words, this 
process will get under way next year, and until then, legal and 
theoretical prerequisites should be created. In his opinion, 
the new scheme will bolster defenses and improve troop 
management.

Ministry] 
  [Text] Pavel Grachev, Army general and Russian defense 
minister, recently summed up the results of our servicemen's 
peacekeeping operations. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] We act as peacekeepers in Moldova, 
in the conflict between Moldova and the Dniester region; and we 
act as peacekeepers in Transcaucasus and Tajikistan. The total 
number of Russian peacekeepers is 16,000 men, more than all 
other countries' peacekeepers combined. We are active 
peacekeepers and we would like to settle conflicts in various 
regions of the former USSR, not just by ourselves but by joining 
forces with others. We are particularly interested in three hot 
spots: Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh; Georgia, 
Abkhazia and, South Ossetia, and the problem of Georgia's 
integrity and its political future; and Tajikistan. [end

<F P=106> [Igor Chernyak report under "From the Life of the Special </F>
Services" rubric: "`Vympel' Discards Flak Jackets"] 
  [Text] According to an officer in the "Vympel" 
counterterrorist subunit, 110 of the 180 officers in the subunit 
have now submitted a formal discharge request. The reason for 
this is their disagreement with Boris Yeltsin's edict 
transferring "Vympel" from the former Russian Federation 
Security Ministry to the jurisdiction of the Internal Affairs 
Ministry. 
  "Vympel" is the well-known special subunit which was 
previously intended for combat operations and counterterrorist 
operations, including those carried out abroad. It was intended 
that "Vympel" would take part, along with "Alfa," in the October 
events and the taking of the White House, but the majority of 
officers in the special subunit refused to participate in the 
storming and on 4 October sat in buses near the U.S. Embassy. 
  A highly placed source in the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, who asked not to be named because "Vympel" had left 
them in the fall of 1993, reported nevertheless that the special 
subunit had effectively collapsed. According to him, on the eve 
of the October events "Vympel" was transferred to the command of 
the Russian Federation Main Protection Directorate, and then 
followed the president's edict transferring it to the Internal 
Affairs Ministry system. However, according to the Russian 
Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen," men in uniform 
cannot be transferred to another department without their 
agreement. The source stressed that, according to his 
information, the officers of the special subunit had come to 
serve not directly in "Vympel" but in the state security 
service, which for them was fundamental. He confirmed that the 
overwhelming majority of "Vympel" officers and NCO's, not 
wishing to serve under Hero of Russia Viktor Yerin [the internal 
affairs minister], had applied for discharge. 
  According to the law, this can be regarded as discharge in 
connection with personnel organizational changes, which brings 
with it the retention of pensions and all benefits. However, in 
the source's opinion, terrorism has existed and will continue to 
exist notwithstanding the wishes of the country's authorities, 
and it is fundamentally impossible to rely on "Alfa" alone to 
combat terrorism; therefore the question of creating new 
counterterrorist groups will arise in the very near future. 
  According to the source, money or benefits is not the main 
issue for the former state security officers. He cited by way 
of example the reaction of the Lefortovo detention center's 
guards to its transfer to the Internal Affairs Ministry system. 
According to the source, the overwhelming majority of Lefortovo 
guards also intend to submit severance notices.

  [Text] The State Committee for Control over Atomic Safety 
(Gosatomnadzor) said the state of nuclear and radiation safety 
in Russia is unsatisfactory. 
  The body came to this conclusion after an inspection of the 
safety of all nuclear and radiation-emanating installations in 
the country carried out last year in accordance with Boris 
Yeltsin's decision. 
  According to Gosatomnadzor, issues related to use of nuclear 
power, materials and substances in both peaceful and defense 
purposes are solved very slowly as they lack a legislative 
basis. As a result, re-cycling or dumping spent nuclear fuel 
alone will require considerable financial and material costs. 
  At present, as many as 29 nuclear reactors with total 
capacity of 21242 Megawatt function in Russia, including 13 
VVER, 11 RBMK-1000, 4 low-capacity EGP-6 and one fast neutron 
BN-600. All these reactors were launched between 1971 and 1990, 
except for the fourth reactor of the Balakovskaya nuclear power 
station which was launched in 1993. 
  There were no serious accidents at nuclear power stations in 
1993 which would lead to releasing significant amounts of 
nuclear materials into the atmosphere or hazardous fires, except 
for several instances of overheating. About half of the 
accidents were caused by reckless maintenance of the equipment 
by personnel. 
  Commenting on the state of the equipment, the committee 
pointed out that the reactors were maintained according to the 
safety requirements which were valid when the reactors were 
launched. At the moment, the reactors fail to comply with the 
modern safety requirements. The committee said the 
first-generation reactors installed at such stations as 
Novovoronezhskaya, Kolskaya, Leningradskaya, Kurskaya and 
Bilibinskaya were designed before the basic documents on atomic 
safety were released in Russia. Now they need drastic 
reconstruction, and such work is being carried out. The first 
and second reactors of the Novovoronezhskaya and Beloyarskaya 
stations have been closed down to be subsequently dumped. 
  An analysis of the accidents which occurred in 1991-1993 
showed a sharp aggravation of the situation at the Kolskaya 
nuclear power station caused by poor maintenance and repair of 
its equipment. 
  Gosatomnadzor also pointed out that spent nuclear fuel is 
practically not taken out of the stations equipped with RBMK and 
EGP reactors, while its removal from other stations is not fast 
enough. The accumulation of spent nuclear fuel may cause a 
situation when there is no free space to dispose of the 
reactor's entire active area in an emergency as safety 
requirements demand. At present, none of Russia's nuclear power 
stations is equipped with the entire complex of installations 
for dumping liquid and solid nuclear waste. The nuclear storage 
facilities are filled to an average of 70% of capacity. 
The 
committee believes that the storage capacities may be exhausted 
in 2-3 years, given the current speed of piling up nuclear waste.

  [Text] Mission Control Centre February 8 TASS -- Russian 
Cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy Polyakov 
have completed their first month on the orbit. 
  The crew's working programme for the period from February 
5-7 
included some astrophysical and medical experiments. The 
cosmonauts also had to unload the "Progress M-21" cargo vehicle. 
Several observations of the stellar sky were carried out in 
accordance with the international "Roentgen" programme to study 
extra-atmospheric astronomy. 
  A regular cycle of experiments was carried out with the use 
of the "Maria" magnetic spectrometer. One of their tasks was to 
determine the possible interconnection between the intensity of 
the flow of elementary high-energy charged particles of cosmic 
origin and the seismic activity on our planet. 
  A radio session is expected to take place today afternoon 
between the crews of the Russian "Mir" space station and the 
American "Discovery" vehicle.

<F P=106> [Report by Chisinau correspondent Mircea Dascaliuc] </F>
  [Text] Today, in a statement broadcast on the national 
radio and television, Moldovan President Mircea Snegur called 
on, quote, all people of good-faith on both sides of the 
Dniester who cherish peace and tranquillity, end quote, and 
urged them to stop all those who wish to start a new conflict in 
this area. The Dniester side virtually refuses to fulfill the 
assumed commitment, namely, to implement the Moldovan-Russian 
accord signed on 21 July 1992, which refers to the peaceful 
settlement of the conflict, said President Snegur. 
  In the security zone that has been instituted on both banks 
of the Dniester River, the separatists of Tiraspol recently 
deployed numerous military formations, motorized, infantry, or 
rocket units, the president of the Republic of Moldova also 
announced, adding that the situation has worsened even more due 
to the proclamation of the state of emergency that led to the 
enclosing of the local population within a real reservation. 
  Further, Mr. Mircea Snegur referred to the violation of 
human 
rights by the authorities of the self-proclaimed Dniester 
Republic, who, not wishing to cooperate in the activity of 
finding political solutions to the conflict, can organize other 
provocative acts that might end with new bloodshed. 
  The appeal concluded with the following words, quote, we 
will 
not admit solutions to the current problems through the use of 
force. The responsibility for the eventual consequences of the 
provocations rests with the leaders in Tiraspol, end quote. 
  A declaration with a similar content was issued today also 
by 
the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Moldova. 
  Also in Chisinau, the Central Electoral Commission, which 
will supervise the elections, held a meeting and examined issues 
connected with electoral lists and the regulations regarding the 
statute of the representatives of the parties and independent 
candidates. 
  Likewise, the meeting discussed a request submitted by Ilie 
Ilascu [Tiraspol detainee], candidate on behalf of the Alliance 
of the Christian Democratic Popular Front of Moldova, who 
requests that appropriate conditions should be created so that 
he can address the electorate in accordance with the legal 
provisions. The Central Electoral Commission suggested that the 
request should be submitted to President of the Republic of 
Moldova Mircea Snegur and ask him, in his capacity of head of 
state, to intervene and fulfill candidate Ilie Ilascu's request. 
In this respect, a decision of the Central Electoral Commission 
will probably be taken tomorrow, Radio Chisinau reported.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 4/2/1994 -- This afternoon 
President Mircea Snegur met with a group of inhabitants of 
Rabnita city situated on the left bank of Dniester; they 
mentioned the violation of human rights in east Moldova, states 
the Presidential Press Service. They said the teachers of the 
sole Moldovan school in the city are harassed and threatened to 
be fired if they do not comply with orders of Dniester 
authorities to use Cyrillic script. Pupils' parents decided to 
protest by not letting their children attend the school 
beginning with 7 February. Their initiative is supported by the 
parents of pupils attending the two Moldovan schools in Tiraspol 
and Tighina (Bender). With the emergency state decreed by Igor 
Smirnov, Moldovans have no right in Dniester to protest against 
the imposed Cyrillic script and the aggravated economic crisis, 
caused by the Tiraspol leaders' refusal to use Moldovan national 
currency. They also cannot protest against Smirnov's decree 
according to which all state employees are compelled to adopt 
until 15 February Dniestrian citizenship. In their opinion, 
measures to stop the libertinism of Dniester's leaders should be 
undertaken. President Snegur stated that for preserving 
Moldova's integrity only political methods will be used and this 
corresponds with CSCE Mission's recommendations. The president 
requested Richard Samuel, new head of the CSCE Mission to 
Moldova, to consider the complaints of Rabnita inhabitants. 
Richard Samuel talked to representatives of Rabnita soon after 
their meeting with Snegur, states the Presidential Press Service.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich by Anatoliy </F>
Gulyayev; place and not given; under the rubric "In the 
Commonwealth": "My Main Political Aim Is the Restoration of 
Economic Union With Russia. The Leader of the Belarus 
Government Has Given Our Correspondent an Interview in Which He 
Talks About the Problems Connected With the Solution of This 
Question"] 
  [Text] Republic of Belarus -- [Gulyayev] Vyacheslav 
Frantsevich, in one of your speeches you said: "The Government 
has a concept. The cornerstone of that concept is cooperation 
with Russia..." But the opposition regards putting the question 
that way as opposing the sovereignty of Belarus and the 
agreement on the creation of a single monetary system as yet 
another manifestation of a "pro-Russian, pro-empire" policy. On 
the other hand, to judge from the reaction of Yegor Gaydar and 
some other Russian politicians there are differing attitudes 
toward the agreement there, too. Hence the following questions. 
First, how does your government's policy tally with the 
sovereignty of the republic? Second, is the unification of the 
monetary systems a manifestation of normal business partnership? 
Or is it pure philanthropy on Russia's part? 
  [Kebich] As for the opposition, these people represent a 
very 
small part of the republic's population. According to the 
latest polls they represent around 4 percent. Their opinion is 
that held by politicians who will do anything to get power. For 
some of them any means will do, and that includes distortion of 
the facts. 
  How can there be any question of an infringement of 
sovereignty in the process of normal economic integration? If 
that is the case you would have to say that those European 
figures who are working for the introduction of a single means 
of payment for Europe are bad patriots, too! Both there and 
here it is a question of economic union among states, each of 
which has its own state organization, Constitution, culture, and 
traditions... 
  But as for philanthropy... Yes, different people cite 
different figures -- trillions of dollars -- which Russia is 
allegedly losing in the ruble zone. 
  Well, let us examine the situation. Let us start with the 
fact that powerful production units created in the republic are 
a constituent part of major technical cycles in Russia, too. 
That is why Russian producers and consumers (unlike some 
politicians) are keenly interested in economic union with 
Belarus. 
  But no one should forget that the oil fields in Siberia, the 
processing enterprises, and the gold and hard currency assets 
were created by the joint labor of the peoples of all the 
republics of the former Union. Including to a considerable 
extent the labor of the Belarusian people. 
  Not to mention the oil pipelines running across the 
republic's territory and transit routes to the West... If we 
start adding everything up, I do not think that it will run to 
trillions. 
  I mention all this not because I want to make any claims. I 
would just like public opinion in Russia and Belarus to be 
formed on the basis of a sober and all-around assessment of the 
situation. 
  After all, the rate of our currency (we did not dream of 
introducing it, incidentally, and did not dream of leaving the 
ruble zone) against the Russian ruble was initially one to one. 
It then fell for two reasons: The first is that prices for 
energy sources rose sharply for us, the second is the Russians' 
indebtedness for output already supplied. If Russian 
enterprises paid us back the money that they owed us for that 
output the ratio would have been different. 
  No, philanthropy simply has nothing to do with it. 
Equitable partnership alone -- the most sober-minded and honest 
politicians in Russia understand that. 
  [Gulyayev] However, the resistance to the ruble zone in 
Russia looks very serious. Once again, this is Gaydar's 
demarche... 
  [Kebich] You know, I do not think that the signing of the 
agreement on the unification of the monetary systems was really 
a serious reason for Gaydar's resignation from the government. 
It goes far deeper. In my view, it may be expressed in general 
terms as a difference of views between the premier and the 
vice-premier on the path of the continuation of the reforms. 
  And the convenient pretext is... Belarus. Or it could be the 
construction of the Russian parliament building, for example. 
This is not a subject for discussion for serious politicians. 
But as a pretext, I repeat, it will do. 
  [Gulyayev] You are doubtless right. But you know that there 
are quite a few people in Belarus who say: Kebich's policy will 
not work. There are too many forces in Russia who are opposed 
to it... Tell me, have you taken the disposition of forces into 
account? In particular, President Yeltsin's opinion? 
  [Kebich] I can cite my recent meeting with him. It lasted 
three hours 30 minutes. I remember the president's words well: 
The union with Belarus must be concluded as quickly as possible. 
We stand to gain from this politically and economically. 
  [Gulyayev] Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that under 
pressure from various political forces the decision on the ruble 
zone will be postponed. Does your government have an 
alternative option? 
  [Kebich] Of course it does. That option is our own 
currency. We are ready for its introduction and, if necessary, 
we will be able to carry it out fairly quickly. 
  [Gulyayev] But it is a question of orientation. After all, 
recently in the republic there has been much debate about the 
turn toward the West in counterbalance to the traditional 
preference for the East. Increasingly often the option of the 
Baltic-Black Sea market comes to mind. How do you regard this 
idea? 
  [Kebich] In itself it is not new. The People's Front's 
plans for the creation of a Baltic-Black Sea union have existed 
for a long time. This union is based on a clearly expressed 
desire to sever ties with Russia. But to lend the idea 
plausibility, they cite various economic computations, of course. 
  I do not regard the question that way. I cannot even 
tolerate the very title of the "Baltic-Black Sea union" (or 
market as you put it). Because Belarus has always had market 
relations -- production and economic relations -- with the 
Baltic. Even when the question of the economic blockade of 
Lithuania was being raised Belarus did not take part in that. 
We traded and continue to trade with our neighbors in Poland 
and Ukraine... These ties have never been broken off. So there 
is no reason to talk of creating some special market here. 
  Russia is a completely different kettle of fish. So long as 
my heart beats I will continue campaigning for a union with it 
as I always have done and am doing now. It is not just a 
question of economic circumstances. We are all linked by the 
closest spiritual bonds. We have a common history and similar 
cultures. There is no family which does not have kin or close 
friends in Russia. Severing those ties would really cut to the 
quick. 
  However, as we have already seen for ourselves, there are 
people on both sides who want to do just that. In NARODNAYA 
GAZETA, the organ of the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet, 
recently, Zenon Poznyak, the leader of the People's Front, wrote 
yet another article that was insulting to our Russian brothers. 
What is more, this man, who regards himself as a serious 
politician, made impudent territorial claims on Russia, 
Lithuania, and Poland publicly for the first time! 
  I repeat that his followers are few. Whereas those who 
support the union with Russia are industrial enterprise and 
collective and state farm leaders and business structures who 
are aware of the threat of further disintegration. The majority 
of the Belarus population favor union, a fact which is 
eloquently demonstrated not just by opinion poll findings but 
also by the many letters sent to the organs of state power and 
administration. 
  I think that with such support the government will succeed 
in 
implementing the decision on the economic union. And in this 
way my government's main political will be achieved! 
  [Gulyayev] One of the most important conditions for 
economic integration is the equality [adekvatnost] of economic 
systems, you said in a new year's eve address to diplomats. But 
does this not mean that Belarus will be forced to ape the 
economic and political decisions of the Russian Government? 
Including those which have led to the disintegration of 
collective farms in the countryside? 
  [Kebich] You would have been entirely right if it were a 
question of a political and economic union. But the ruble zone 
is not a political and economic union. It is first and foremost 
a single financial and monetary system. And that is all. 
  Russia will still have its Law on Land with all its 
idiosyncracies. Just as we will still have our law which 
envisages private ownership in very restricted limits -- less 
than 20 percent of the land resources. 
  We will still have our law on the priority of agriculture 
and 
it is being implemented. In any event, whereas industrial 
enterprises have already stopped working because of the shortage 
of electricity not one milking operation on a single collective 
farm has been disrupted for that reason. And the main field 
campaigns have always been supplied with fuel. 
  Our policy of support for collective farms as the main 
agricultural producers and the development of measures for the 
social protection of peasants remains unchanged. Recently, for 
example, by special government decree the national bank opened a 
line of credit amounting to 715 billion rubles to finance costs 
incurred in the preparation for sowing work... 
  We are not going to blindly copy the state system in Russia 
either. In short, under the single monetary system Belarus will 
still have the possibility of following its own path. Just as 
Russia will. We have reached full understanding with Russia's 
leaders on this point. 
  [Gulyayev] Understanding is a good thing. But our rural 
readers are eternal pragmatists. They are accustomed to 
assessing all events from the standpoint of what actual benefit 
they bring. That is why we are putting the question in these 
terms: How will the agreement on the single monetary system 
affect the well being of the peasant, whether Belarusian or 
Russian? 
  [Kebich] To begin, let me say that I, too, am a pragmatic 
man. I do not like bombastic words, I prefer concrete and 
down-to-earth matters. That is why I propose to examine the 
situation using concrete examples. 
  Here is example number one: The energy sources presently 
being supplied to the republic from Russia reach our peasants at 
prices approximately one and one-half times higher than their 
Russian counterparts. But the existence of the single monetary 
system presupposes standard prices. So all the fuels and 
lubricants for peasants will become cheaper. This means that 
life will become easier for the Belarusian collective farm 
member and private farmer. 
  Example number two: Customs duties alone add about 35-40 
percent to the cost price of a tractor, for example an MTZ, the 
moment that it crosses the border near Smolensk. But the 
agreement on the ruble zone envisages a single customs area. 
This means that the Smolensk peasant will be able to buy a 
Minsk tractor (or a feed combine harvester, or an MAZ vehicle, 
or a refrigerator) at almost half price. This means that life 
will become easier for them too. 
  I could cite a great many examples of this kind. But they 
all amount to the same thing: The economic union with Russia 
will bring real, tangible advantages not just to the peasant but 
to every citizen in our countries. And more and more people in 
Belarus understand that... 
  [Gulyayev] Do you mean the people who form the so-called 
"Kebich party"? After all, you know that this term has appeared 
in some politicians' speeches, don't you? In other words, your 
government is being viewed not even as a team of like-minded 
people but as something considerably broader -- as a political 
force. Do you agree with this assessment? If so, how do you 
rate the chances of the "Kebich party" in the coming elections? 
  [Kebich] Yes, there has always been much hullaballoo and the 
use of labels and stock phrases around me and my supporters. 
First there was talk of a "team." Then they began saying that 
this is not simply a team but a party. Generally speaking I am 
not afraid of this word. Although there is an opinion that the 
government should be outside party politics. But in real life 
that is not the way of things. Thus it is possible that a party 
will appear in the future... It is not ruled out. One thing is 
clear: Whatever name is used, we, the sensible politicians and 
economic managers, represent a real force which one way or 
another is influencing political processes. Life will show how 
powerful that influence is going to be.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 25 (515) for 7 </F>
February 1994] 
  [Text] Russian and Belarusian experts have ended a 
three-day meeting at a government retreat outside Minsk by 
narrowing differences on the four main directions in a mechanism 
for creating a monetary union between Russia and Belarus, one 
senior negotiator told Interfax on condition of anonymity. 
  These include a mechanism of account-settling, budgetary 
problems, the rate of exchange of the Russian and Belarussian 
currencies and a single price system. 
  Unlike Moscow which insists on a single budget, Belarus 
wants 
to hold back to its own budget because of fearing to forfeit its 
sovereignty. 
  It was agreed that the Russian and Belarusian currencies 
would be exchanged at a one-to-three rate for non-cash 
operations and a one-to-one rate in cash settlements. (In a 
formal letter to the Belarusian government, the IMF recommended 
a 1:2.5-3 rate of exchange. IF). The agreed rate of exchange 
is not final being subject to substantial change, the negotiator 
said. 
  Nor was there any final agreement reached on uniform price 
policies. But preliminary counts indicate Minsk will inevitably 
have to sustain part of the cost for the maintenance of Russian 
army bases deploying long-range nuclear weapons there if a 
monetary union deal is signed. 
  Contrary to local expectations, Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, who was due to arrive in Minsk next week to sign a 
package of agreements on the monetary union, was unlikely to 
arrive there until February 18, the official said.

  [Text] Today, First Deputy Prime Minister Mikolay 
Myasnikovich held a news conference on the results of talks with 
a Russian delegation on the merging of the Belarusian and 
Russian monetary systems and the creation of a single ruble 
zone. According to Mikolay Myasnikovich, both parties have 
stated that obligatory conditions for the functioning of a 
single money system are as follows: 
  1. The setting up of equal conditions for mutual trade 
between economic entities in Russia and Belarus; 
  2. The creation of a single mechanism for price 
formulation. 
  3. The use by Belarusian economic entities of Russian 
prices for energy and other resources; 
  4. The setting up of single customs duties [as heard]. 
  Mikolay Myasnikovich said that the parties have agreed on 
the 
methods for establishing the exchange rate of Belarusian "hares" 
and Russian rubles. According to these calculations, as of 1 
January 1994, the exchange rate of one Belarusian "hare" to one 
Russian ruble is 2.19:1. The exchange rate as of 1 March 1994 
will likely be 2.5:1.

<F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb by A. </F>
Bezveselnyy; place and date not given: "Mechyslaw Hryb: `My 
Attitude Toward the Military Has Not Changed'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Hryb] My attitude toward the 
military -- for me, this category includes not only servicemen, 
but also law enforcement officials and KGB officers -- did not 
change and has remained the same since I was elected chairman of 
the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. However, I would like to ask all 
these categories of people to enhance their struggle against 
crime and to further strengthen the legal order. 
  [Bezveselnyy] This task better fits militia organs, does it 
not? 
  [Hryb] Not only. Servicemen can help militia organs maintain 
civil order by carrying out joint patrols. In addition, 
maintaining military discipline among the troops is of primary 
importance as well. Therefore, the leadership of the executive 
branch ministries (I have already spoken with all of them) do 
not oppose this issue. I believe that we can still do this work 
and we can activate our fight against crime to give our people 
the chance to live and work. 
  [Bezveselnyy] In a word, you have nominated new ministers 
instead the old ones.... 
  [Hryb] Not yet. I spoke about people who act as power 
ministers. In the immediate future, a corresponding Supreme 
Soviet and Cabinet of Ministers commission will nominate 
candidates for these posts. 
  [Bezveselnyy] Well, one last question: Who will head the 
Supreme Soviet Commission for National Security, Defense, and 
Crime Fighting? 
  [Hryb] We have not yet discussed this issue. In my mind, we 
will do so in due time.

  Kozyrev believes that although problems still exist and some

and constructive, without mutual recriminations. He believes 
that since his latest visit to Tashkent last year, the acuteness 
lessened and misunderstanding decreased. From the Russian 
Embassy Kozyrev headed for the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry and 
began negotiations with Uzbek Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Said 
Asymov.

  The relative calm established along most of Karabakh 
frontline in recent days is still being maintained. 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters reported 
that the fighting continued only in the north of Kelbadzharskiy 
Rayon in the direction of Omar Pass over the last day. But 
dense fog and heavy snowfall on the mountains are hampering 
active military operations. 
  Despite that, the Karabakh forces managed to destroy one 
enemy armored car and three troop carriers, and killed a great 
number of Azerbaijani soldiers.

  [Text] According to Seyran Hovanyan, head of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army headquarters, the 
noticeable drop in the activity of the Azerbaijani Army all 
along the Karabakh war front is due to a depletion of its 
strength resulting from the incessant large offensives since 18 
December and from failure to achieve any tangible results. 
  Certain successes scored by the Azerbaijani Army at the 
start 
of the winter campaign due to its multifold superiority in men 
and material were mostly localized and temporary, and they were 
soon neutralized by the Karabakh army units. 
  The unprecedented losses suffered by the Azerbaijani Army 
also played a significant role in lessening the intensity of the 
military operations. 
  According to data available to NKR Defense Army 
headquarters, 
the Azerbaijani side lost up to 5,000 soldiers and officers 
killed over the last one and half months. It also lost one 
military aircraft; 62 armored cars, including 36 tanks; 12 
cannons and artillery pieces, three of them Grad launchers; and 
large amounts of other military equipment. 
  In that same period, nearly 300 fighters were killed on the 
Karabakh side. Its losses in military hardware amounted to 24 
military vehicles, which were completely recouped by the capture 
of tanks and armored personnel carriers from the Azerbaijanis. 
  In that same one and half months, 26 Azerbaijanis servicemen 
surrendered voluntarily. Among them are also citizens of other 
countries. 
  According to Seyran Hovanyan, no matter how much the 
Azerbaijani side tries to cover up its losses, its consequences 
cannot but effect the situation on the war front and the morale 
of the Azerbaijani Army.

  [Text] Yerevan, February 7. (SNARK) -- Azerbaijan receives 
great military help from Turkey and Afghanistan, Vahan Papazyan, 
Armenian Foreign Affairs Minister told Armenian TV. According 
to Mr.Papazyan, the mercenaries from the CIS are fighting the 
Azeris side. So, Azerbaijan hopes Karabakh conflict could be 
solved by force. 
  Rapid changes take place with the Azerbaijani authorities, 
but no changes take place with the political course of the 
state. "It seems as if only Abulfaz Elchibey, during the last 
months of his power was taking the course of peaceful regulation 
of the conflict", said Vahan Papazyan. 
  Mr. Papazyan reaffirmed the position taken by the Armenian 
side -- military ways of the conflict solution will give no 
results.

  [Text] Baku (February 4) TURAN--Today President Geydar 
Aliyev of Azerbaijan received Russian Ambassador in Azerbaijan 
Valter Shonia on his request. 
  During the meeting Aliyev said that development of 
political, 
and economic relations with Russia is of a strategic importance 
for Azerbaijan. He also said that Baku will do anything to 
maintain the many sided relations with its northern neighbour. 
  Touching upon the Russia's mediation role in the regulation 
of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, Geydar Aliyev said, that 
"Armenian party forwards the unacceptable conditions, and what a 
shame that Special Russian Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, in fact, 
took a pro-Armenian position." 
  In his turn Russian Ambassador said that "Moscow understands 
the processes happening in Azerbaijan and the positions of our 
countries coincide in many aspects." Shonia also said that 
Russian leadership is ready for any cooperation with Azerbaijan. 
Then the meeting continued behind the closed doors. 
  Meanwhile, as a source at the Russian Foreign Ministry told 
the Moscow correspondent of TURAN news agency, Moscow began 
"twisting Azerbaijan's arms" recently, trying to force it to 
receive the Russian plan for the regulation of the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict. According to the information available, 
Russia insists on the acceptance of the plan, presented by 
Vladimir Kazimirov last week. As reported the idea of the plan 
is - the parties to the conflict declare cessation of 
hostilities, then Russian troops are stationed in the conflict 
zone, and the Armenian forces withdraw from the southern regions 
of Azerbaijan (Dzhebrailskiy, Fizuliskiy, Agdamskiy). After all 
this is implemented, the sides will begin the discussion of the 
political status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the question of the 
Armenian withdrawal from Kelbadzharskiy region of Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Azerbaijan's death toll in the past six weeks of 
regional fighting runs at about 5,000, a Karabakh military 
official told INTERFAX. 
  Seiran Oganian said Azerbaijan lost a large amount of 
weapons 
including one aircraft, more than 60 units of armor (36 of them 
tanks), 12 artillery pieces and three rocket launchers and a 
large amount of other weaponry. He said as many as 36 Azeri 
troops were taken prisoner, some of them mercenaries from other 
countries. 
  The official put the Karabakh army's losses over the same 
period at some 300 dead. He said that Armenian forces had also 
lost 25 units of armor but these were replenished at the cost of 
tanks and army vehicles captured from Azerbaijan. 
  On the relative calm on the front lines, Oganian said this 
followed an unprecedented toll of casualties, exhaustion and 
frustration by the Azeri army. 
  He says Azerbaijan's initial successes in the early stages 
of 
the latest offensive due to its preponderance of troops and 
weapons were temporary and had soon been neutralized by Armenian 
troops.

Tbilisi. CIA chief James Woolsey came to Tbilisi to collect 
Woodruff's body.

  [Text] Baku (February 5) TURAN -- Being in Georgia Russian 
Defense Ministry, Pavel Grachev said that the protocol of 
intention concerning location of Russian military bases in 
Georgia had been signed. Three bases are supposed to be set up: 
in Tbilisi in Vaziani region (Military-Air forces), in 
Akhalkalaki (Motor-infantry brigade) and in Batumi 
(Motor-infantry brigade). Batumi's base will have its branch 
offices in Sukhumi, Poti and Gudauta. The bases will be 
established from those Russian troops which located now in 
Transcaucasia. They are mostly infantry troops, aircraft, 
planes SU-25 and bombing aviation. It should be noticed that 
Russian military bases are set up in Georgian regions 
neighbouring with Turkey which are inhabited by Armenians and 
Adzhars. 
  Military ships of the Black Sea fleet will be placed in 
Poti. 
The bases will be established till July 1 1994. Their goal is 
to safeguard the security of Russia and Caucasian countries 
which enter Collective Security Pact. 
  The troops located in Georgia will be led by Commandant of 
the group of Russian troops in the Caucasia General Fedor Reut 
excluding 345th landing regiment. This regiment is under the 
control of Russian Defense Minister. 
  In the times of the USSR a corps consisting of three 
motor-infantry divisions, units of 40th air army and units of 
the 19th army was located on the territory of Georgia. 
  As far as the 4 point of the agreement (on equipment of 
Georgian armed forces with Russian technique) concerns, the 
Russian President Yeltsin said that one can not speak about 
military equipment until the problems concerning ethnic 
minorities of Abkhaz and South Osets are left unsolved. 
  According to Foreign Minister Kozyrev, the agreement can 
stimulate the achievement of political settlement of the 
situation in Abkhaz and South Osetia. 
  However, on February 4 Deputy Chairman of Abkhaz mass media 
Yuriy Vorontsov said that Georgian government set South Osetia 
and Abkhaz outside of Georgia. 
  Minister of Foreign Relations of South Osetia, Urusmak 
Jioyev 
stated that Russia tries to settle Georgian problems by military 
way. He recalled recent developments in Western Georgia when 
"Russian troops seized the whole regions and the supporters of 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia committed the genocydis". 
  Deputy Chairman of mass media of South Osetia, Valeriy 
Khubulov said that republic step aside from Georgia and joined 
the Northern Osetia. "We want to live together with the Northern 
Osetia", he stressed. 
  At the same time political and social movements of the 
nations of the North Caucasus (excluding Inghush) came out 
against the conclusion of Russian-Georgian treaty. According to 
the opinion of the leadership of the Confederation of the 
Caucasian Nations, Russia decided to back Georgia to strengthen 
its positions on the Black Sea and the Caucasus. This Moscow's 
policy will lead to the fact that Russia will lose its positions 
in the North Caucasus which is isolated from Russia. The 
officials of the North Caucasus say that the more Russia tries 
to preserve the integrity of Georgia the more the nations of the 
North Caucasus step aside from it. 
  The day before Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia, Russian 
State Duma came out against conclusion of the treaty with 
Georgia. According to majority deputies, if Moscow establishes 
close relations with Tbilisi it will lose the North Caucasus.

<F P=106> [Report by GIA (GEORGIAN INFORMATION SERVICE) correspondent </F>
Galina Chikovani on the press conference given by Dzhaba 
Ioseliani, head of the Georgian delegation at the Geneva talks 
on the Abkhazian conflict, chairman of the Interim Committee for 
the State of Emergency Under the Head of State, leader of the 
Mkhedrioni paramilitary organization, on 2 February; place not 
given: "Dzhaba Ioseliani: `The New UN Resolution on Settling 
the Conflict in Abkhazia Is an Important Phenomenon'"] 
  [Text] Dzhaba Ioseliani went on the offensive at the 
beginning of the press conference held on 2 February. 
  "Abkhazia is Georgia's pain and a journalist should not 
ignore any question pertaining to it. Moreover, such important 
events and documents as the negotiations in Geneva and the 
communique and resolutions adopted by the UN demand constant 
attention on the part of the media. Belated news evokes 
justified indignation and confusion." 
  Objective information should be provided on the fate of the 
300,000 refugees and thus satisfy journalists and the interest 
of 5 million people. The journalists reacted to these justified 
remarks in silence and silence is a sign of agreement. 
  Then Ioseliani acquainted those present with UN Security 
Council Resolution 896. 
  "The main thing," he explained, "is for the refugees to 
return to their homeland without being presented with any 
preliminary conditions. Let anyone return who does not present 
any kind of danger [a condition advanced by the Abkhazian side] 
-- this is an absolutely absurd idea. Who determines this 
danger? This violates the chief principle of the UN: the 
protection of human rights. 
  "No less important," continued Mr. Dzhaba, "is that the 
resolution condemns any forms of changing the demographic 
composition of Abkhazia and the Republic of Georgia, including 
by means of settling people who did not live there before." 
  The news that the UN supports the deployment of UN 
peacekeeping forces or other forces sanctioned by the UN in the 
conflict zone aroused great interest. 
  The peacekeeping forces will become a guarantee for the 
return of refugees to their native land. 
  "It is essential to point out that this resolution," said 
Mr. 
Dzhaba, "adopted on 31 January of this year is the outcome of 
the meeting in Paris between our head of state, Eduard 
Shevardnadze, and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali." 
  Naturally, the journalists raised many questions in 
connection with the visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to 
Georgia. 
  "This is indeed an historic event. A legal basis will be 
laid for all our relations." 
  Many questions related to the political status of Abkhazia. 
  "Georgia has never abolished the autonomy of Abkhazia; 
however, nor has it agreed with the feudal reasoning of the 
Abkhazian separatists." 
  Everyone was interested in hearing his views on recent 
events 
[the killing of several Mkhedrioni leaders and the planned 
disbandment of the organization]. Mr. Dzhaba similarly did not 
refuse to give an answer to this complex question. 
  "It is indeed difficult for me to speak about this. It suits 
some people to speak out against the Mkhedrioni but let them not 
forget that the Mkhedrioni has lost more than 600 young men 
during the last four years. Our idea focused on the creation of 
a Georgian army, based on a national army, one led by 
professionals. 
  "As for the Rescue Corps [into which the Mkhedrioni has been 
incorporated], we still have few professionals; therefore, we 
are sending young people to other countries to be trained and to 
acquire experience."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 25 (515)] </F>
  [Text] The Georgian government said that the processes now 
underway in the Gali District of Abkhazia showed that the 
Abkahzian leaders tried to thwart the Geneva talks on resolving 
the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
  The Georgian government said in a statement made public 
Monday that it "is prepared to continue the search for a 
political settlement through negotiations but will take every 
step to protect Georgian citizens in the area which is occupied 
today by separatists and their protectors." 
  The document accuses what it described as "certain political 
quarters in Russia" of "virtually provoking the Gudauta leaders 
into a new escalation of barbarism" by rejecting a comprehensive 
treaty between Georgia and Russia.

<F P=106> ["Statement of the Government of the Republic of Georgia" -- </F>
read by announcer] 
  [Text] It is more than two months since the world community 
became actively involved in the process of conflict settlement 
in Abkhazia. As a result of two rounds of UN-sponsored talks 
held in Geneva through the good offices of the Russian 
Federation and with the participation of the CSCE, a memorandum 
of 1 December 1993 and a communique of 13 January 1994 were 
signed. Both documents urge the conflicting sides to renounce 
violence, mapping out ways for a peaceful settlement. 
  Nevertheless, Gudauta separatists are continuing to use 
artillery to shell the population in the Kodori gorge, burn down 
villages in Gali Rayon, and kill and attack civilians, women, 
children, and the elderly. Facts have emerged of killings of 
dozens of people, including prominent public figures. In 
effect, the deliberate policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing 
against the Georgian population in Abkhazia is continuing. 
  Details of the latest act of vandalism committed by Gudauta 
separatists have emerged. With the use of heavy equipment, they 
burned down six villages in Gali rayon - Priveli Gali, 
Konstitutsia, Rechkhi, Pkhira, Namarkeli, and Ghumerishi. 
Hundreds of innocent people were burned to death in the fires. 
  It is noteworthy that this latest act of barbarism occurred 
ahead of two important dates mentioned in the Geneva Communique 
of 13 January: 8 February, when a joint group of experts 
working on Abkhazia's status meets in Moscow, and 10 February, 
which is the beginning of the voluntary and peaceful 
repatriation of refugees and displaced persons to Gali Rayon. 
It is likely that the latest brutal act committed by the 
separatists was aimed at wrecking the Geneva process. 
  The government of the Republic of Georgia states that it 
remains a supporter of and participant in the peaceful 
settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia but, at the same time, is 
ready to take all measures to defend Georgia's citizens who 
remain on the territory occupied by the separatists and their 
hirelings. We are also saying this in order to bring it to the 
attention of forces in Russia who by their opposition to the 
treaty between Russia and Georgia have in fact incited the 
Gudauta group to step up their barbarism.

  [Text] Abkhazian troops early on Monday thwarted an attempt 
by Georgian sabotage groups to try to blow up a bridge across 
the Inguri River separating the two confronting sides, the 
Abkhazian Defense Ministry said. All of the saboteurs were 
taken prisoner. 
  It says the attack followed a 30-minute mortar fire on 
Abkhazian positions close to the village of Tagiloni. There 
were casualties among Georgian civilians. 
  The ministry says the Abkhazian army has continued 
operations 
to wipe out Georgian sabotage groups infiltrating the Gal region.

  [Text] The Abkhaz Ministry of Defense has released 
information which claims that at 0200 on 7 February Georgian 
guerrilla units in Abkhazia attempted to blow up a road bridge 
near Gali and that the attempt was foiled by Abkhaz militants. 
The same report says that the Georgian side shelled Abkhaz 
positions for 30 minutes. 
  This information was deliberately spread by the Abkhaz 
separatists, in order to blame the Georgian side for violating 
the agreement on a peaceful settlement of the conflict in 
Abkhazia and to block the return of refugees to Gali Rayon. 
  In this connection, the press center of the Georgian Defense 
Ministry has stated the Georgian Armed Forces strictly adhere to 
the Geneva agreement and have not been engaged in any 
hostilities. 
  As for the loss of 60 people in Okumi [village in Gali 
Rayon], this information does not correspond to reality either.

  [Text] A high-ranking official from the Russian Federation 
Security Council confirmed in an interview with INTERFAX on 
Monday that a separate structure might soon be established to 
coordinate activities of the Russian special services. 
  However, he refuted the allegations by certain media that 
this could lead to a merging between the special services and to 
establishment of a "super department" like the Ministry of 
Security and Interior Affairs. 
  The Ministry of Security and Interior Affairs was set up in 
early 1993 on the initiative of former Security Chief Viktor 
Barannikov under the presidential decree. However, this 
ministry was soon abolished by the president himself under the 
Constitutional Court's resolution. 
  The Security Council's official believes that it would be 
preliminary to discuss possible composition of the "community of 
special services." 
  According to certain media, the leaders of the Federal 
Counter-Intelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, 
the Federal Agency of Governmental Communications and 
Information, the Main Department of Defense, the president's 
Security Service, the Intelligence Department of the Russian 
Armed Forces' General Staff and chiefs of the departments which 
are to be created on the basis of the reorganized Interior 
Ministry will be included in this body. 
  According to the Security Council's official, it is unlikely 
that the Russian president will make a practical move towards 
the coordinating body's establishment. "It is necessary to 
determine exactly the authority of each integral part of the new 
body before this happens," the official emphasized.

  [Text] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, in answer to 
parliament's social committee question about the possibility of 
increasing social tax, told the parliament that the government 
considers such a step "fatal" for Estonian economy. 
  Laar affirmed that the government has repeatedly analyzed 
the 
decrease in retired persons income due to inflation and price 
rise, and has prepared a bill on increasing retirement benefits 
that should reach Riigikogu by April 1. At present the pension 
is approximately 300 ($21) kroons, depending on the years of 
labour, per month. 
  Prime Minister said that increase of pensions would demand 
an 
additional 200 million kroons (about $14 million) to increase 
pensions by 50-60 kroons ($4). He said that the situation could 
possibly be solved by dividing the social tax, which at present 
is 20 per cent for companies, between the employers and the 
employees, a move, which is not supported by the social 
committee of the parliament. Also turnover tax or excise duty 
on tobacco and alcohol could be increased a couple of per cent 
or the tax payment control increased by Tax Board, which, 
however, demanded higher budget for the board. 
  Prime Minister added that it might be possible to substitute 
the retirement benefits by pension insurance in the future.

  [Text] Kohtla-Jarve February 8 TASS -- A scandal was caused 
in Estonia by the activity of counsellor of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), Petr Rozhok. 
  In his interviews and statements he urged officers who 
retired from the Russian armed forces and who, under the laws of 
the Estonian Republic, are threatened with deportation, to form 
self- defence units and to resist by force any attempts to evict 
them. 
  Petr Rozhok told ITAR-TASS: "We live in the Russian land." 
  Mikhail Toporov, executive secretary of the Veterans Union 
in 
E stonia, said that this is a provocation aimed at creating 
another hot spot in Europe. "We have decided to defend our 
rights by political methods. We sent complaints against the 
denial of residence and eviction of former officers to the 
United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, the European Council and other organisations. We must 
take realities into consideration which representative of 
Zhirinovskiy's party refuses to do...", he said. 
  Estonian newspapers reported on Tuesday that the activity of 
representative of the LDPR in Estonia, Petr Rozhok, will be 
discussed by the next cabinet meeting.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 07, BNS -- Russian police in the 
disputed region of Petseri/Pechory on Saturday [5 February] 
detained a group of Estonians that included a government 
adviser, the leader of a lobbying group for reunification of the 
region with Estonia, and a video team of the Estonian television. 
  The group was taken to a police office in the town of 
Petseri 
and kept there for two hours. 
  Reet Tobre, the head of the Petserimaa movement, said 
Russian 
officials had said the arrest was due to filming. The Estonian 
television team had filmed a local church, industrial buildings 
in the town, as well as the railway station and local 
headquarters of a Russian border guard unit. 
  The police had told the group that Petseri is located in a 
border zone where filming is allowed only for holders of special 
permits, which can be obtained for a fee. "The police very 
carefully examined our documents. We had the Russian visas and 
we had crossed the control line legally," Tobre added. 
  Tobre's Petserimaa (Petseriland) group advocates the rights 
of the legal Estonian citizens in the region and stands for 
reunification of the region with Estonia. 
  The police had also tried to examine the material filmed by 
the video group, but had failed to do so because of not having 
the necessary equipment. 
  Aino Leppik, adviser to the government, in an interview 
today 
said the issue was being dealt with by the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  "It is absolutely inadmissible that Russian police detain 
Estonian citizens in Petseri without any charges. This, under 
the constitution, took place on the Estonian territory," said 
Leppik, who was among those detained. 
  The television team and Aino Leppik were visiting Petseri 
for 
celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the local Estonian 
school. 
  The area, an Estonian territory under the 1920 peace treaty 
with Russia, was annexed and named a region of the Russian 
Federation shortly after World War II, when the Soviet Union was 
occupying the country.

  [Text] Two new Russian Army units have been formed on the 
territory of Skrunda radar station. Ilgonis Upmalis, head of 
the Latvian bureau for monitoring the Russian Army withdrawal, 
told the Baltic News Service that until now there has been only 
the radar station itself and an MT [expansion unknown] 
battalion, but now an additional hospital and a 
counterintelligence unit have been formed as separate military 
units. 
  Although the Russian military personnel who are already 
stationed in Latvia serve with the units, Upmalis believes that 
the stationing of the units on just the territory of the Skrunda 
radar station is wrong, because the issue of the status of that 
facility in Latvia has not yet been coordinated at interstate 
talks.

Lithuania Algirdas Brazauskas, Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius, Foreign-Affairs Minister Povilas Gylys and others. 
  After the ceremonial welcome, Leonid Kravchuk departed for 
the Antakalnskoye cemetery to lay a wreath at the memorial to 
the defenders of freedom. 
  Kravchuk and Brazauskas will meet one-to-one during the 
first 
part of the day, after which the Ukrainian president will 
address a plenary session of the Seimas and the two heads of 
state will sign a treaty of friendship and cooperation between 
the Ukraine and Lithuania.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 07, BNS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk's meeting Feb. 8 with Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas will make history, said Rostislav Bilodid, Ukrainian 
ambassador to Lithuania. 
  In an interview with the Vilnius-based Russian-language 
newspaper ECHO LITVY, the ambassador said a Baltic-Black Sea 
alliance should be created, but "must not be narrowed only to a 
political notion." 
  Bilodid said considerable work needs to be done in terms of 
economic cooperation because the present volume of trade between 
Lithuania and Ukraine cannot satisfy either of the sides. 
  The ambassador said Ukraine can become a major market for 
Lithuanian goods, but Lithuania concentrates on economic ties 
with the West, the North and the East, while the South slips 
past without being seen. "My task is to direct Lithuania's 
attention in the southern direction," he said. 
  In Bilodid's view, mutual settlements are a major problem in 
economic relations between Lithuania and Ukraine. The 
ambassador said the increasing rate of inflation in his country 
creates additional difficulties. Among other problems, he also 
mentioned the imperfectness of banking systems in both 
countries. "All these problems are already discussed by experts. 
I think, the presidents will also utter their weighty 
arguments."

<F P=106> [Report by Rasa Verseckaite: "The Independence Party Did </F>
Not Commit Suicide"] 
  [Text] On Saturday [29 January], the Independence Party, 
founded by V. Cepaitis [former leader later accused of 
collaboration with the KGB], held its fifth congress in the 
Teachers' House. The congress was attended by 99 delegates, 
while the party itself has 316 members. Opening the congress, 
party leader V. Sapalas (by the way, he was reelected for 
another term) expressed his delight with achievements and his 
distress with losses. He called the results of the elections to 
the Seimas [parliament] the greatest political disgrace -- 
Lithuania was the first to declare independence and elect 
communists to power. V. Sapalas regretted the humiliating 
behavior of the right-wing parties before the elections who were 
embarrassed to accept the Independence Party to their bloc. 
"Our brothers in ideas turned away, while the Nationalists' 
Party was the only one to extend a helping hand," said V. 
Sapalas. He admitted that many people were waiting for the 
Independence Party to destroy itself and merge with some other 
party. 
  Maybe, not only then, but even now many people expected that 
the Independence Party would sign a verdict for itself. "One 
can call your party a team of persistent people," praised them 
R. Smetona, leader of the Nationalists' Party. He added that 
the plan of the Homeland Union to use Sajudis as a means of 
annexing other smaller parties was unacceptable. It was also 
incorrect to revive Sajudis at the cost of smaller parties. 
Addressing the congress, however, Homeland Union leader V. 
Landsbergis repeatedly proposed to rally together and join other 
parties, maybe, the Homeland Union because it will be a force in 
the future. According to V. Landsbergis, circumstances in 
Lithuania decided the domination of two political blocs, and one 
had to take this into account. As the best proof of his 
statements, V. Landsbergis presented the results of the Seimas 
elections -- about 15 percent of the votes were lost because 
they were distributed among small parties and organizations. 
Both V. Landsbergis' propaganda and A. Terleckas' [leader of 
the Freedom League] opinion (the latter proposed that the 
Independence Party merge with the nationalists and the 
Democratic Party and elect R. Smetona leader) were dismissed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, Russian Federation deputy </F>
foreign minister, by Yelena Kalyadina; place and date not given: 
"Diplomacy Without Pomp or Bomb"] 
  [Text] It would be impossible to imagine Russian policy in 
war-torn Yugoslavia without the modest and charming Vitaliy 
Churkin, a diplomat of 20 years' standing. The deputy foreign 
minister has studied the situation on the spot, and not just 
from UN reports. For this reason the journalistic fraternity, 
which is sincerely in sympathy with him, nicknamed him the 
"Yugoslav shuttle." So it was him that we asked to comment on 
the tragic events in Sarajevo and also to speak about the 
initiative recently advanced by Russia for settling the Yugoslav 
crisis. 
  [Kalyadina] Vitaliy Ivanovich, I remember how at a news 
conference you answered a question about why Russia, which is 
making a big contribution to the process of a Yugoslav 
settlement, does not advance its own independent plan by saying: 
"We are modest people." What now: Have we overcome our 
timidity and decided to show ourselves? 
  [Churkin] No. That was said at the time rather as a joke. 
During the war in the Balkans Russia has repeatedly advanced its 
own initiatives. Precisely at critical moments in the 
development of events, moreover. A real danger has now arisen 
that all the tremendous work which the international community 
has done in its attempt to resolve the conflict by political 
means might be wrecked. If a settlement is not achieved on the 
basis of the plan for creating unions [unii] of the republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the situation will exacerbate sharply and 
could entail deeper world community involvement in the conflict 
-- with an extremist approach, moreover. 
  To avoid such a development of events we proposed carefully 
preparing and holding a session of the UN Security Council at 
foreign minister level in Geneva and inviting representatives of 
the three warring sides in Bosnia to it, together with 
delegations from the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and 
Croatia. The idea in itself is simple. But any initiative can 
look good, in my view, when it fits in with what has already 
been achieved. This is the crux of our proposal: to continue a 
more intensive joint search for a political settlement by 
utilizing the authority of the United Nations. 
  [Kalyadina] Two chief questions in a Yugoslav settlement fit 
in with the well-known "carrot and stick" policy. The 
possibility of bombing strikes acts as the stick. The carrot is 
the encouraging prospect of the lifting of sanctions from 
Yugoslavia. According to our new initiative, Russia will 
advocate their lifting in the very near future if an accord is 
reached. And yet I remember you saying quite recently that 
things will not get moving without compliance with sanctions. 
Is this a fundamental revision of our position? 
  [Churkin] No, essentially our position has not changed. The 
fact that on this issue we have succeeded in getting some things 
moving is another matter. We have gotten an understanding with 
the European Union that, once a peace agreement on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is signed, the sanctions will be lifted as it 
is implemented. A different situation is also possible, whereby 
the Serbian side will fulfill all the demands made of it, while 
the others will be unwilling to undertake a political 
settlement. In that case it will be necessary to find an 
opportunity to lift the sanctions from Yugoslavia on carefully 
stipulated terms. We must, after all, be mindful of the fact 
that not only the FRY is suffering as a result of them -- all 
the Balkan countries are incurring losses running into billions. 
  [Kalyadina] The United States also seems to be starting to 
think about this. THE NEW YORK TIMES recently carried an 
interesting item, namely CIA forecasts from which it follows 
that the economic embargo against Serbia has outlived its 
usefulness and will very soon be lifted. Assessments by such a 
powerful organization as the CIA and published, moreover, in 
such an influential newspaper represent a kind of trial balloon. 
How realistic, in your view, is a revision of the U.S. 
positions on the sanctions issue? 
  [Churkin] It is obvious to me and to many other observers 
that the U.S. position is changing substantially. At first, 
after acceding to power, the Clinton administration believed 
that the events in Bosnia represented aggression by Serbia. But 
now the United States is increasingly realizing that a civil war 
is at the bottom of the conflict. It is interesting that, 
whereas a year ago the Americans did not accept our approaches 
at all, they now sometimes quote us when they speak of their 
understanding of what is happening. In general there is 
evolution. But I do not believe that it will quickly result in 
the question of lifting the sanctions being raised, since the 
U.S. internal political struggle over the "Yugoslav issue" is 
even more complex than in our country. 
  Europeans frequently criticize the Americans for not taking 
an active enough part in the Yugoslav business. But I believe, 
and I try to prove this to them, that the conflict is taking 
place in Europe, where primarily European interests are 
concentrated, and the Americans simply do not want to get 
involved. 
  [Kalyadina] The Belgrade newspaper POLITIKA, which reprinted 
the article from THE NEW YORK TIMES, arrives at this remarkable 
conclusion: If it revises its views on the Yugoslav crisis, 
Washington could gain prestige by once again acting in the role 
an omnipotent peacemaker, and the Europeans should reflect on 
this. But maybe we should too? Is it not time for Russia to 
take the "Balkan question" into its own hands? 
  [Churkin] When a problem involves many countries it is 
essential to start by asking ourselves: Just what do we want? 
A real solution to the problem, or a propaganda effect? 
  We have all emerged from the Cold War, when there was little 
policy and a lot of propaganda. The main thing was to make some 
kind of grand initiative. And it was not important that 
everyone then forgot about it immediately -- the important thing 
was to get in first. But if you require something real it is 
sometimes more useful if the initiative is taken by your 
partners. That is how, in my view, the Yugoslav crisis should 
be seen. We are berated around the world for allegedly being 
pro-Serb. And if, say, an initiative to lift sanctions was 
proposed by us, it would stand little chance of success. When 
the same thing is proposed by the EU, it is quite a different 
matter. What is important here is that the proposal embody our 
approaches. Look, after the failure of the Vance-Owen plan a 
new European version of the plan arose. However, we were the 
first in diplomatic contacts to talk about that plan's 
inevitable failure... I believe that quiet diplomacy is far 
more useful than noisy diplomacy. 
  And in general it is good when policy is made by those in 
good physical and financial shape. Every initiative should have 
material support. It is one thing if we propose a settlement 
plan and have four divisions to implement it or several 
billions, say, to restore Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Kalyadina] The question of sanctions can be put as follows: 
By advocating the lifting of sanctions, will Russia not be 
helpinmg to strengthen the internal political position of the 
Belgrade authorities and President Milosevic? 
  [Churkin] That does not worry me at all. We would get even 
more bogged down if in seeking a settlement we tried to harm 
particular authorities. Moreover, there is, as the recent 
elections showed, no alternative to Milosevic at the present 
time. This has to be taken into account, as does the fact that 
the president has recently been playing a very constructive role 
in the talks. 
  [Kalyadina] How, in your opinion, will Milosevic's victory 
help to resolve the conflict? After all, in the runup to the 
elections he had to think not only about how to loosen the 
sanctions stranglehold but also how to avoid being suspected, as 
it were, of undue leniency toward the Muslims and Croats. 
  [Churkin] There is a general postulate here: the stronger 
the authority, the easier it is to make compromises. But I 
would not want my words here to be interpreted as meaning that 
the Serbs have hidden scope for concessions. 
  [Kalyadina] Vitaliy Ivanovich, there was recently a verbal 
duel between your chief, Andrey Kozyrev, and Mr. Zhirinovskiy. 
Vladimir Volfovich threatened the minister with dismissal if he 
did not very quickly alter the policy in the Balkans and side 
unconditionally with the Serbs. In this regard the respected 
newspaper IZVESTIYA made a dispiriting forecast of growing 
conflict between the Foreign Ministry and the Duma. How 
justified was this? 
  [Churkin] I have quite the opposite feeling. In terms of 
foreign policy in general and the Yugoslav settlement in 
particular we will, it seems to me, enjoy considerably more 
constructive relations with the Duma than with the former 
Supreme Soviet. There will be fewer attempts to introduce 
domestic policy conflicts into foreign policy and more work will 
get done. I, for example, can subscribe almost in its entirety 
to the resolution on Yugoslavia passed by the Duma. I would 
make only one addition. I would add the word "promptly" to the 
phrase "Propose that the president raise officially the question 
of lifting sanctions in the Security Council." And then sign. 
  Moreover, in my opinion, the Serbs have realized that 
nothing 
will come of trying to exploit our domestic political conflicts. 
  [Kalyadina] So has it now become irrelevant to ask "Whom do 
you, our masters of diplomacy, side with -- Serbs or Croats?" 
That, after all, is the way it was put to us at the start of the 
conflict... 
  [Churkin] I consider the main problem in this conflict to be 
the extremist approaches of all three sides, including the 
Serbs. And those who state that as Slavs side we should with the 
Serbs are unwittingly doing the Serbs a bad turn, as they are 
giving support to those of them who are urging their own people 
to commit suicide. 
  The conflict in general is so complex that it is impossible 
to fathom without having been on the spot and gotten the feel of 
it all. 
  [Kalyadina] You have been there, indeed many times. And, 
incidentally, changes in your views are noticeable. Whereas 
previously you reminded people more of a 
professor-cum-theoretician of diplomacy, now, forgive the 
comparison, you are more like a "city manager" of diplomacy. 
Have you revised your stance fundamentally? 
  [Churkin] I would not say that I had a pro- or anti-Western 
stance on the Yugoslav question. But I have always thought 
that, if we confronted the United States and Europe, nothing 
would be achieved either in terms of a settlement or in our 
relations. We have achieved the main aim of pursuing our own 
line but without falling out with anyone. We have won respect, 
it seems to me, even among those who criticize us. 
  [Kalyadina] Given such esteem, perhaps a Churkin plan will 
shortly replace the Vance, Owen, and Stoltenberg plans? 
  [Churkin] No, and do not get the idea that I am the author 
of our entire policy in the Balkans; I merely maintain contacts. 
As far as plans are concerned, as you can see, for the time 
being nothing specific is coming from them. It is extremely 
difficult to divide up a multinational country, where everything 
was tightly interwoven until still quite recently. 
  [Kalyadina] What, then, can we do? 
  [Churkin] We can hope for improvement, including the success 
of our initiative 
  [Kalyadina] Excuse me, but I do not somehow very much share 
your hopes. In my view, the actual UN mechanism through which 
Russia intends to implement its idea is considerably out of 
date. The previous commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, the 
Belgian General Bricquemont, submitted his resignation with the 
words: "I am not reading any more Security Council resolutions, 
because they do not help...." 
  [Churkin] But no other mechanism has yet been devised. So 
we have to improve the existing ones. Moreover, it is not the 
case that everything is bad. The United Nations used to be an 
organization of ideological confrontation. Now times are 
different. 
  As far as our initiative is concerned, we will be able to 
talk about success if we manage to preserve the current 
settlement plan. When the Vance-Owen plan failed and the "let's 
bomb" proposal was made we managed to get everyone back to the 
negotiating table. That situation is shaping up now. 
  [Kalyadina] So to recall the classic formula: It is one 
step forward, two steps back... 
  [Churkin] That's the way it goes. In many respects 
diplomacy is a Sisyphean labor.

  [Text] Russian air force commander Colonel-General Petr 
Deynekin said that the contemplated bombing of Serb positions in 
Bosnia for unblocking Sarajevo may kill many civilians. 
  He told Interfax on Tuesday that he was against the use of 
military aircraft in civil wars. 
  "Bombs cannot be used without the civilian population's 
preparations for warfare. The use of air bombs in ethnic 
conflicts and in the war in Yugoslavia will be inhuman," he 
said. 
  He pointed out that Bosnia was not ready for bomb attacks. 
Neither civilians nor children are being evacuated, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "NATO Tending Toward Decisive </F>
Action Against Serbs Following Tragedy in Sarajevo. Moscow 
Urges Restraint"] 
  [Text] Following Saturday's tragedy, when 68 people were 
killed and around 200 were wounded by a mortar shell in the 
Sarajevo city market, the Bosnia situation is extremely tense. 
Few people in the West doubt that the Serbs besieging the 
Bosnian capital are responsible for what happened. 
  On the initiative of France and Britain representatives of 
the 16 NATO states are meeting in Brussels Tuesday [8 February] 
to consider air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali has also come out in support of such a 
step. According to him, the decision to bomb Serbian artillery 
positions around Sarajevo does not require a special Security 
Council resolution: A positive decision by the NATO council is 
sufficient. 
  Moscow is categorically opposed to such an approach. "We do 
not accept Butrus-Ghali's arguments and we do not believe that 
the present case is covered by previous Security Council 
resolutions. There need to be consultations with the Security 
Council members," a senior Russian diplomat observed. 
  Russia has resolutely condemned the organizers of Saturday's 
attack and said that they must be severely punished, but Moscow 
is in no hurry to place the blame on the Serbs. "The 
investigation is not yet completed. According to ballistics 
experts, the mortar shell came from an area where both Serbs and 
Muslims have positions. Until the Serbs' responsibility is 
proved, the international community must not take any steps," an 
informed source in Smolensk Square [site of Foreign Ministry] 
told IZVESTIYA. 
  Moscow is anxiously awaiting the results of the 
investigation: If it is established that the mortar was fired by 
the Serbs, Russian diplomats are unlikely to be able to persuade 
the West to refrain from taking decisive steps. Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic, who was quick to dissociate 
himself from Saturday's action, calling it the "work of war 
criminals," would be in an extremely unpleasant position. 
  Although Belgrade does still have a chance to save face by 
blaming extremists who do not answer either to Milosevic or to 
Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs. If the West 
accepts this version, you might merely get a show trial, with 
the question of the bombing of Serbian positions removed from 
the agenda. 
  "The West's reaction has to be rational, not emotional. 
Before embarking on extreme measures it is necessary to 
consider whether this would bring us nearer a settlement or, in 
fact, lead to an exacerbation of the conflict," the Russian 
diplomat, who deals with the Balkans, believes. 
  Smolensk Square makes no secret of its annoyance that the 
recent Russian initiatives on Bosnia were so coolly received in 
the West. "We were actually proposing strengthening the security 
zones, including Sarajevo. If our arguments had been heeded, 
Saturday's tragedy might have been avoided," one of the authors 
of the rejected peace plan said.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal

"there will be no air bombardment of Serbian positions in 
Bosnia." He was commenting on the UN Secretary General's appeal 
to NATO headquarters to consider the possibility of air strikes 
designed to break the siege of Sarajevo. 
  If Butrus Butrus-Ghali "heads an organization which is a 
subsidiary of some country" and "suppresses the freedoms of 
other countries," then "we and other East European nations will 
leave that organization," the LDP leader emphasized. 
  His second-largest party group in the Russian State Duma is 
outspokenly pro-Serbian when the Yugoslav crisis is discussed. 
  Asked whether he will propose any initiative if the Serbian 
positions were bombed, Zhirinovskiy said that "there is no if" 
for him. 
  "We reject all kinds of violence. We do not want even to 
hear of air strikes against Bosnian towns," the LDP leader said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 7 TASS -- A Russian State Duma 
deputy has called for an objective investigation into the causes 
and circumstances of the bomb explosion in Sarajevo on Saturday 
[5 February] that killed at least 68 and wounded over 200 people. 
  Vladimir Lukin, head of the foreign affairs committee of the 
State Duma, the lower house of Russia's new parliament, said on 
Monday that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali should 
have made his appeal to NATO commanders on air strikes against 
Bosnian Serbs only after such an investigation had been 
completed. 
  "It is necessary to find out what actually happened and who 
may benefit from this, and only after that can one take steps 
through the U.N. Security Council. Only the Security Council 
can endow the secretary-general with respective powers," Lukin 
said. "I would be extremely surprised if Russia is cut off from 
this process." 
  Lukin stressed that the use of force in any conflict is 
fraught with serious consequences. Asked if the State Duma will 
make any decisions in connections with the explosion in 
Sarajevo, Lukin said "the Duma does not realise the Russian 
foreign policy. This is the prerogative of the president and 
the government." 
  He recalled that the State Duma had already expressed its 
attitude towards the crisis in former Yugoslavia by urging all 
sides concerned to refrain from the use of force and settle all 
disputes only by peaceful means.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Sidorov: "Moscow Wants Impartial </F>
Investigation"] 
  [Excerpts] The Russian Foreign Ministry has demanded an 
impartial investigation of the facts surrounding the explosion 
at the market in Sarajevo, which accounted for the lives of 
around 70 people, and the publication of its results. The 
Foreign Ministry statement, published Sunday, expresses anger at 
the monstrous crime against civilians and also contains a call 
for the culprits, whoever they might be, to be severely punished. 
  The Russian side's position remains unchanged, a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said -- a solution to the Bosnian problem 
must be sought by peaceful, political means. The attempts to 
wreck the peace settlement process that are currently being made 
by gunmen on various sides could lead to disaster. Air strikes 
against Bosnia, in his opinion, can only result in the sides' 
taking a harder line, and every effort must be made toavoid this 
"last resort." [passage omitted] 
  According to observers, the incident could not only provoke 
a 
hasty decision by NATO to strike at Bosnian Serb positions 
around Sarajevo but could also greatly worsen the situation in 
the city itself. Sarajevo radio is already urging Muslims to 
"unsheathe their knives and deal with the Serbs and Croats 
living in the city." Clearly, those who are responsible for the 
explosion were hoping not least to radicalize the thinking of 
the Muslim population of Sarajevo, which lately has been 
increasingly blaming the current Sarajevo authorities for its 
ills.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuznechevskiy commentary: "Who Benefits from the </F>
Tragedy in Sarajevo?"] 
  [Text] Last Saturday a series of explosions occurred in one 
of the busiest markets in the Muslim districts of Sarajevo, 
resulting in the deaths of 68 of the city's peaceful residents 
and injuries, including very grave injuries, to more than 200. 
  At first the story was put about that the tragedy occurred 
as 
the result of mortar fire, allegedly from positions held by 
Serbian armed formations. Later, when the real scale of this 
inhuman carnage began to become apparent, people started saying 
that the fire might not have come from Serbian positions but 
from some others. Then they started saying that the series of 
explosions occurred right on the spot as the result of charges 
which had been laid earlier and which someone (but who?!) set 
off. 
  It is beyond doubt that, whoever was to blame for this 
tragedy, this killer (or killers) must be punished and appear 
before a court. Is this not the reason why the international 
tribunal in The Hague for crimes against the person on territory 
in the former Yugoslavia was set up? Only I believe that this 
killer will never be found. There are several points which 
cause me to think along these lines. 
  Right after the tragedy, the Serbian side in Bosnia issued a 
statement in which it urged the holding of an international 
investigation into the crime that had been committed and 
guaranteed unimpeded access to the site for international 
experts. Why would it do this if some people accuse precisely 
it of the tragedy? 
  There are other disconcerting points. This is not the first 
such instance, you know. More than a year ago, also in 
Sarajevo, a shell allegedly fired from a tank gun killed 20 
people and injured dozens of peaceful residents at a bus stop 
close to the market in the Muslim districts. Then too there 
were demands for the Serb tankman who allegedly drove up to that 
spot and fired the shot to be called to account. There were 
calls for NATO aircraft to start bombing Serbian positions 
without delay. Then it turned out that neither the tank nor the 
mythical Serbian tankman had existed. The author of that 
tragedy was never found. 
  It cannot escape your notice that both these events occurred 
on the eve of the conclusion of peace talks among the three 
warring sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At that time the talks 
were wrecked. 
  By the beginning of 1994 the Serbs and Croats had virtually 
completely agreed their positions and displayed readiness to end 
hostilities. The Muslim side had also begun to voice 
satisfaction with the talks. The very dangerous military 
conflict at the center of Europe seemed to be finally 
approaching a peaceful outcome. But suddenly (suddenly?) the 
position of the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership hardened, and 
it demanded territorial concessions from the Serbs and Croats. 
In the end, the concessions were made. The talks were led out 
of the impasse. But the Muslim side again, for the umpteenth 
time, pulled out of the talks process and left Geneva virtually 
without advancing any new terms at all, but demanding that the 
West make bombing strikes against Serbian positions. 
  Once again the impasse was being surmounted, and the Serbs, 
Croats, and Muslims were to meet once again in Geneva 10 
February to continue the peace talks process. The tragedy in 
Sarajevo could prevent that meeting. 
  But who would benefit from wrecking the peace talks even at 
the cost of spilling a lot of blood of Sarajevo's peaceful 
residents? This is the hardest question. In any case it is 
perfectly obvious that neither the Serbs, nor the Croats, nor 
the Muslim leadership itself benefit from the talks being 
wrecked. 
  There is evidently still someone who cannot stomach the 
possible peaceful outcome of the Balkan conflict. It is this 
"someone" who is resorting to provocations, not afraid of blood. 
It seems to me that he must be sought not among those who are 
already tired of fighting and shedding their blood. The 
shortest way to find him could be to ascertain just who is 
constantly pressuring the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership and 
compelling it to walk out of the talks time after time. But 
this, so it seems to me, is a matter for the international 
tribunal in The Hague.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Vladimir Lukin Accuses Foreign </F>
Ministry of Loyalty to `Brezhnevite Diplomacy'"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Only the naive could imagine that 
relations between the United States and Russia would immediately 
become cloudless after the word "partnership" was used. "That 
is not the way things happen," Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma 
International Relations Committee, told your IZVESTIYA 
correspondent. 
  There is a firm opinion that America won the cold war and 
that Russia lost and now America has to treat Russia as the 
vanquished side and dictate its terms. Even though the U.S 
Administration is trying to act tactfully this does not always 
come off and does not always succeed, he said. 
  "What price, for example, the present discussion about who 
should be a minister in Russia and who should not? Just imagine 
a situation in which official representatives of Moscow began 
saying that we will not be friends with you if Lloyd Bentsen 
remains Treasury Secretary and if he is not replaced by Jeffrey 
Sachs because we think that Sachs is better suited to your 
interests and your reforms. Of if Warren Christopher remains 
secretary of state whereas we would like him to be replaced by 
Gus Hall, for instance. If the United States does not 
relinquish this tendency of trying to teach us what we should be 
doing in the government no good will come of it." 
  Answering your correspondent's rejoinder that the United 
States is stating its terms not for the sake of "friendship" but 
for assistance and the payment of money which the administration 
is going to raise from its taxpayers, he remarked ironically: 
"They are giving us assistance equivalent to half a deputy 
minister but they are demanding the replacement of a whole 
government." 
  Can America make a substantial contribution to the success 
of 
the Russian reforms? It can, Lukin believes. For that it needs 
to "make it possible to export to America the little that we can 
export right now." 
  "Look at what is happening with uranium. During the summit 
meeting in Moscow we seemed to have concluded an agreement. But 
the U.S. Commerce Department is putting forward around 20 new 
conditions and is effectively trying to backtrack on this deal." 
  Lukin is convinced that the best way that the Americans can 
help to ensure that "we have a more or less decent budget and a 
more or less decent ruble" is by not creating obstacles to 
Russian exports. 
  "That is what we need, not talk about who is going to be our 
finance minister. Remember all that talk: If we have Gaydar we 
will have reforms, without Gaydar there will virtually be 
communism and totalitarianism. Gaydar was no more [Gaydara ne 
stalo] when Chernomyrdin came and the distribution of money did 
not increase. Then superman Fedorov appeared and the same 
refrain began again: Fedorov is the reforms, without Fedorov 
there will be no reforms. Instead of that, Lukin said as though 
addressing the Americans, do a number of practical things which 
will make our life easier. But let the sovereign country known 
as Russia make the choice of whom to appoint and where and how." 
  When asked about the reliability of the persistent rumors 
about differences of opinion with the Russian foreign minister, 
Lukin replied by quoting Griboyedov: "I would be glad to serve 
but I loathe grovelling." He developed this idea in the 
following way: "I have done the job which the president gave me 
-- representing Russia -- and I did this as I thought necessary. 
As to whether anyone finds me convenient or inconvenient, that 
hardly bothers me." Although Lukin said that he prefers to talk 
about concrete problems rather than concrete people, the thrust 
of his criticism leaves no doubt about the active dislike of a 
number of principles embodied by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  "I am not sure that a diplomat's main task is to be 
constantly on the move, shaking hands, smiling, and sending 
telegrams from one country to another about how our leadership 
is respected in that country," Lukin said, terming this style of 
work the "ostentatious airport style of diplomacy" and the 
"legacy of Brezhnevite diplomacy." 
  However, the former diplomat's most serious objections were 
reserved for the childish disorder of America-worship, which he 
calls "infantile pro-Americanism, which has been stubbornly 
practised by a number of our politicians." 
  "The politicians of the era of infantile pro-Americanism 
were 
about 50 percent responsible for what happened in the recent 
elections," Lukin claimed. "I warned that in our country with 
its lack of political culture and its often black and white view 
of the world there would sooner or later be a situation marked 
not by an attitude of enlightenment but of chauvinism. 
  "Today, when a number of our officials are hopping like 
fleas 
from Sakharov to Zhirinovskiy and back, all this does not create 
a sense of the worthiness of our policy. I, fortunately, have 
not hopped in that manner and I am not going to."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "United States Fears Russian </F>
Imperialism and Promises To Look After Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Alarmed and annoyed by the new 
language of political figures in Russia, where even liberals 
have started speaking with an accent like Zhirinovskiy's, the 
United States has decided to switch from Russia to Ukraine. 
This is a result of a meeting between the U.S. President and 
leading foreign policy advisers. 
  Two new events which had not been envisaged in the U.S. 
scenario prompted this review, which by all accounts is not 
coming easy to the White House. They are, first, the inability 
of the reformist section of the former Russian Government to win 
sufficiently broad public support, which became a springboard 
for Zhirinovskiy's success, and second, the Crimean presidential 
election. 
  In endeavoring to avoid both the triumph of Russian 
imperialism and the Yugoslavization of the post-Soviet area, the 
White House is markedly deviating from principles which only 
recently it was firmly espousing. 
  First, the United States, which has previously put pressure 
on Western borrowers and investors, the World Bank, and the IMF 
to make allowances when allocating new loans to Russia, does not 
intend to do this any more. 
  Second, the period during which one of the main purposes of 
U.S. aid was to strengthen President Yeltsin's political 
influence can be considered to be over. "The impressive 
performance of nationalists, communists, and other antireform 
forces in the December elections has cooled Washington's ardor 
to play Russian politics," THE WASHINGTON POST writes. 
  Third, the State Department has confirmed that Clinton and 
his advisers have reached "firm agreement" about the need to 
support Ukraine's intentions to revive its withered economy and 
"put an end to disputes with Russia regarding Ukraine's 
possession of nuclear weapons." 
  Fourth, President Leonid Kravchuk, who for a long time was 
something akin to persona non grata here, will at last be able 
to visit Washington in March. He will be given financial aid in 
order to weaken Russia's attractiveness in the eyes of the 12 
million ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. It is also proposed 
that the aid will be made conditional on the Ukrainians' 
agreement to radical economic reforms. 
  Fifth, the U.S. Administration's reluctance to "pursue new 
lines in Europe" is no longer as absolute as it appeared very 
recently, during discussion of the "Partnership for Peace" 
program. Although Washington does not believe that the Russian 
Government will want, or be in a position, to recreate an empire 
on the ruins of the USSR, people here will also do all they can 
to oppose Russia's domination in this region. 
  Ukraine is more than just some other republic capable of 
serving as a counterweight to the trends making themselves 
increasingly manifest in Moscow, and the United States will try 
to play the Ukrainian card adroitly.

<F P=106> [Interview with "spokesman for Moscow's security services" </F>
Aleksey Kandaurov by Franco Bigazzi; place and date not given: 
"New Order at KGB"] 
  [Text] The Russian security services may be changing their 
name, but the spirit and discipline that characterized them 
until the dissolution of the KGB must provide an example for 
future generations. This was said by spokesman for Moscow's 
secret services, Aleksey Kandaurov, who granted PANORAMA the 
following interview. 
  [Bigazzi] How will the services be reorganized following the 
decision to abolish the Security Ministry, formerly the KGB? 
  [Kandaurov] Yeltsin's decree sets out the broad outlines of 
the functions and structures of the renewed special services -- 
the struggle against the espionage and subversive activities of 
foreign services; the struggle against terrorism, against 
illegal armed groups, against movements with extremist leanings, 
against drugs and arms trafficking, and against corruption and 
smuggling. 
  [Bigazzi] Is there a real threat of political terrorism such 
as that of the Red Brigades in Italy? 
  [Kandaurov] There are already some armed groups that have 
taken up weapons. Right-wing subversive movements such as 
Aleksandr Barkachev's for instance. Armed extremists are 
proliferating throughout Russia, and it is becoming increasingly 
difficult to combat them. 
  [Bigazzi] Following the demise of the blocs, is there still 
pressure from "foreign agents"? Which secret services are more 
dangerous? 
  [Kandaurov] The CIA remains the most active, like the 
British, French, and -- albeit to a lesser extent -- the Italian 
services. On top of this, agents of the former Soviet republics 
are now operating in Russia, too. Five Georgian agents and one 
Estonian agent who committed a homicide have been arrested. In 
1993, 20 foreign agents were arrested. 
  [Bigazzi] Zhirinovskiy is worrying the West. Did you 
forecast the rise of the ultra-nationalists? 
  [Kandaurov] Two weeks before the elections we forecast that 
Zhirinovskiy's party could have win 24 percent of the votes. We 
were only wrong by one percent. 
  [Bigazzi] Many people, including Gorbachev, say that 
Zhirinovskiy used to be a KGB agent. Is it true? 
  [Kandaurov] Not to my knowledge. In any case, what does it 
mean, to have been a KGB agent? A number of the present 
democratic leaders were KGB agents, too.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy article under the rubric "Portraits of </F>
Foreign Military Leaders": "Pentagon Remains in William Perry's 
Hands"] 
  [Text] In launching this new rubric it was by no means our 
intention to start off by introducing the head of the defense 
department of the United States -- undoubtedly one of the 
world's leading military powers. But fate so decreed -- 4 
February saw the completion of the almost two-month marathon to 
choose the new head of the Pentagon. 
  Reports that President Bill Clinton had chosen William Perry 
as his latest candidate for the post of defense secretary were 
headlined in various ways in different American newspapers: 
"Mathematics Professor Gets Difficult Job"; "Pentagon Number Two 
Becomes Number One." All of them got it right. 
  Hitherto he held the post of first deputy secretary of 
defense, a very responsible post but one, in general terms, with 
a not very high public profile. In this capacity, as the 
right-hand man to the retiring Les Aspin, William Perry played a 
considerable role in preparing and implementing the revision of 
the strategic concept for America's military-organizational 
development. He also gained a detailed grasp of all the nuances 
and subtleties of the budget battles in and around Congress. He 
also managed to build working, and to some extent personal, 
contacts with the top U.S. generals. 
  Addressing hearings of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
Perry stated that in his activity at the head of the U.S. 
defense machine he intends to continue to a considerable extent 
the strategic course set by his predecessor and former boss. 
This is not surprising. First, he himself had a hand in 
formulating this line and, second, the main guidelines of the 
country's military policy are dictated by perfectly obvious 
objective factors. There is no way Perry can get away from the 
need to reform the Armed Forces, nor can he ignore the 
increasing requirement for American troops to participate in 
multinational coalitions, including when peacekeeping operations 
are being conducted. 
  However, some new strands can also be detected in the new 
defense secretary's first public statements. Among these one 
might single out the point that henceforth American troop 
contingents -- whether they are under the UN flag or NATO 
auspices -- will nonetheless be under American national command. 
The only exception envisaged is for small units up to company 
level. Definite conclusions have evidently been drawn from the 
Somalia operation, whose none too successful outcome had a 
negative impact on the Clinton administration's prestige and did 
not strengthen the former defense secretary's position, either. 
  All the indications are that William Perry will also have a 
new approach to the problems of forming the defense budget. He 
does not intend to repeat the mistake made by Les Aspin, who 
advocated a drastic and substantial reduction in U.S. military 
expenditure. This is why the word both on Capitol Hill and on 
the right bank of the Potomac is already that this process is 
necessary but will be more "cosmetic" in nature. During the 
Senate hearings Perry himself mentioned a shortfall of $20 
billion in the draft budget for fiscal 1995. Avoiding 
categorical statements as to whether he agrees or disagrees with 
this kind of deficit, the new Pentagon boss promised to find the 
money earmarked for paying servicemen's wages at the new, 
increased rate by cutting expenditure on certain weapons 
systems. So all the niceties will be observed: We have cuts in 
the military budget but they do not undermine the foundations of 
combat readiness (since cutting expenditure on these weapons 
systems one way or another had been suggested under the previous 
leadership). 
  It is easier to understand William Perry's skill or, if you 
like, his inventiveness when you remember that before the 
Pentagon he headed up a number of enterprises in the U.S. 
defense industry, including big ones like United Technologies 
and FMC, and that he also worked for a big investment banking 
company in Sam Francisco. The defense secretary's career resume 
is indeed an impressive one. 
  He is a mathematician by training who studied at Stanford 
and 
the University of Pennsylvania, the holder of many academic 
titles and degrees, and a member of the National Engineering 
Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the 
Committee on International Security and Arms Control under the 
National Academy of Sciences. He has been a member of a group 
of advisers to the foreign intelligence service, the Senate 
Technology Review Commission, and the Board of Trustees of the 
Carnegie International Foundation. In the early sixties he was 
a Pentagon technical expert, and in the Carter administration he 
held the post of deputy secretary for research and development 
and was in charge of arms purchases. 
  In "scrutinizing" the as yet still a contender for the 
defense secretaryship, as is common practice in America (it was 
precisely this which finished off the previous candidate for 
Pentagon leader, retired admiral Robert Inman) journalists noted 
William Perry's great erudition. In their words, Perry has a 
pretty good knowledge of the works of Victor Hugo and Graham 
Greene. He has pretty liberal views on the role of women in the 
armed forces. Perry himself has five daughters, and his wife is 
an accountant and economist. 
  U.S. senators consider that 67-year-old William Perry will 
be 
"an excellent defense secretary" and "a real professional with 
enormous practical experience." He was given a similar 
testimonial by President Clinton when he nominated Perry for the 
post of defense secretary. The new Pentagon boss' view of 
relations with Russia and its immediate neighbors is not without 
interest for us. The development of events in Russia, he says, 
can and must be controlled only by the Russians themselves. At 
the same time Perry agrees with Bill Clinton's view that help 
for the implementation of democratic reforms in Russia is a most 
important priority for U.S. national security and the policy of 
ensuring lasting and stable peace. William Perry also sees it 
as one of his most important tasks in his new post to promote 
the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and 
Russia. 
  It has been reported from Washington that top officials in 
the U.S. Administration offered the post of defense secretary to 
almost a dozen prominent American politicians and businessmen. 
Virtually all of them, including Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, former Republican Senator Warren 
Rudman, and Martin Marietta boss Norman Augustine turned down 
this honored but exacting post. William Perry joyfully accepted. 
He believes that in his new job he will be able to worthily 
serve his country and the American people.

welcomes the steps taken by the Ukrainian parliament, which 
ratified two of six points in the START I Treaty. An official 
from the Russian Foreign Ministry stated this in a conversation 
with an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. In his opinion, this was 
made possible by an accord reached during the January trilateral 
summit between delegations from Russia, the United States, and 
Ukraine in Moscow. A mechanism for implementing Ukraine's 
decision on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its 
territory was drawn up at the meeting. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Russia hopes that the talks on the nuclear problem 
to begin in Kiev on Tuesday [8 February] will clarify all issues 
pertaining to nuclear weapons, leader of the Russian delegation 
Yuriy Dubinin told Interfax. 
  He believes that the Ukrainian parliament's resolution on 
the 
ratification of the START-I treaty, passed on February 4, 1994, 
has many "ambiguous places." It does not say, for instance, 
what percentage of nuclear weapons is to be eliminated. 
  Dubinin said that on November 18, 1993, the Ukrainian 
parliament passed the resolution on the ratification of the 
START-I treaty, according to which only 36% of the 
Ukrainian 
missiles and 42% of the warheads were to be eliminated. 
"This 
goes against both the START-I treaty and the Lisbon agreements. 
It's still unclear whether Ukraine intends to eliminate 
100% 
of the nuclear weapons located on its territory in strict 
accordance with the START-I treaty and the Lisbon protocol," he 
said. 
  According to Dubinin, neither is it clear whether Ukraine 
will join the nonproliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. 
  Speaking about Ukraine's participation in NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program, he said that Russia is approaching this issue 
calmly. "Russia has already supported the partnership concept. 
Why should Ukraine not join it?" he said.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondents Vladimir Zaynetdinov and Sergey </F>
Chernykh: "Moscow-Tbilisi: Friendship Demands Sacrifices"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi-Moscow -- The interstate Treaty on 
Friendship and Cooperation has been signed. However, there were 
no happy faces or celebratory salvos fired. 
  It became clear prior to the Tbilisi summit that no one 
wanted the upcoming signing except the heads of state. The 
State Duma came out against it -- deputies feared that the 
treaty would exacerbate the situation in the North Caucasus and 
provoke another demarche by the Confederation of Caucasus 
Peoples, which takes all the rebellious regions of Georgia under 
its wing. 
  The Russian Government sighed deeply and got ready to grant 
further unsecured credits. 
  Russian servicemen, who were about to quit finally this 
restless region where they had suffered so much strife and 
humiliation, are unpacking their bags. 
  The signing of the treaty is seen in Georgia as solely a 
forced measure. The country's impoverishment has gone beyond 
all conceivable bounds. People fainting from hunger in the 
center of Tbilisi are an everyday occurrence. There have been 
three full-blown wars, leaving aside strikes, blockades, and 
political and economic crisis. The hopes of integration within 
the world community were dashed almost simultaneously with the 
fall of Sukhumi. In these conditions you have to grasp any hand 
that is extended. So the signing of the treaty by Georgia is 
not so much a gesture of goodwill as a "recognition of 
necessity." 
  There is no doubt that the Georgian radical dissidents 
Chanturiya and Tsereteli will soon start fighting again for the 
independence of the republic, as in the seventies. 
  The local mafia, which has been furiously printing coupons, 
by no means all of which have been sold, has also had its nose 
put out of joint. 
  The Georgian parliament is well aware of the political 
failure: The country's economy will be revived through Russian 
money, Russia will set up the Georgian Armed Forces, and Moscow 
specialists will settle the sovereign state's internal problems. 
Not for nothing does the old proverb run: "Whoever controls 
Tbilisi controls the Caucasus." Roughly the same situation is 
emerging as in the 19th century, and Georgia is acquiring 
roughly the same status. 
  The Russian president's visit to Georgia is perhaps 
comparable only to the arrival of Czar Nicholas II at the 
beginning of the century. A state of emergency was declared in 
Tbilisi: The streets, particularly the airport road, were 
repaired as much as possible, while bread and even other food 
appeared in stores. 
  As already reported, Georgian Deputy Defense Minister 
Nikolay 
Kekelidze, who was in charge of armaments and tehnical supply in 
the military department, was killed by an explosion in his own 
apartment on the actual day of the visit. He kept a small stock 
of weapons and munitions in his own apartment in the center of 
Tbilisi. Arriving at the scene of the incident at 1300 hours, 
Defense Minister Gorgiy Karkarashvili was almost killed himself, 
sustaining contusions of medium severity -- also from a bomb 
blast. 
  To protect themselves against such "coincidences" the 
Russian 
side took complete control of the airport and all the places 
visited by the Russian president. The high ground overlooking 
the airport was occupied by Russian assault troops while the sky 
was patrolled by fighters. Changes were made to the Russian 
president's security system: Soldiers on compulsory service 
were enlisted for the first time for such an important matter. 
They were mustered from all sorts of special subunits of the 
Army and Internal Troops. Their function was to provide 
external protection for the delegation. This was previously 
done by "Alfa." This time there were only a few men from "Alfa" 
present.

for relations of strategic alliance with Russia, believes 
Dmitriy Ryurikov, aide to the Russian Federation president on 
international affairs. 
  This will serve as a background for work in other areas, he 
noted in an interview to a RIA correspondent, commenting on the 
results of the Russian-Georgian summit. 
  Speaking about the prospects of Russian-Georgian cooperation 
in the military domain, Ryurikov stressed that unless the 
conflicts in Abkhazia and South Osetia are settled, cooperation 
will be impossible.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamyshev report: "Fate of 14th Army Determined. </F>
Russian Military Will Receive Legal Status"] 
  [Text] The persistence of the Dniester region leaders in 
trying to hound General Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, from 
Tiraspol has so far been yielding the opposite results. In 
Moscow yesterday, Moldova Prime Minister Andrey Sangheli 
discussed, among other questions, the problem of concluding a 
Russia-Moldova agreement on temporary status for the Russian 
army. Should the document, whose draft has already been 
approved by Boris Yeltsin, be signed, the positions of the 14th 
Army and its commander would become as strong as they have ever 
been. 
  The more than two-year presence of the 14th Army on the 
territory of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldovan Republic, on 
the one hand, has constantly energized anti-Russian sentiments 
in Moldova, and on the other, has served as a reliable lever 
with which Russian leaders have been trying to divert Chisinau 
from thinking about uniting with Romania. Stating the readiness 
to pull out the 14th Army, Moscow at the same time linked this 
question with the progress of settlement of the Dniester 
conflict. Given the sharpness of the present differences 
between the sides, this formula virtually means an indefinite 
presence of the Russian military in Moldova. It is not 
surprising that, unable to get rid of the Russian military, 
Chisinau would wish at least to put certain limits on their 
activities in the Dniester by concluding a special agreement on 
legal questions pertaining to a time frame for the presence of 
Russian military formations on Moldova's territory. 
  No details of this documents are known so far, but the 
political circumstances in which it was approved by Boris 
Yeltsin are remarkable. On the one hand, Moldova is in for 
parliamentary elections where, many believe, supporters of an 
independent state within the framework of the CIS would score 
victory. At the same time, the conflict between the authorities 
of the Dniester Moldovan Republic and General Lebed has led to 
the 14th Army commander's transformation from a hero of the 
Dniester to an "enemy of the people" and "traitor." Now, after 
the signing of the agreement with Moldova, the general and his 
soldiers would be under Moscow's and Chisinau's legal protection 
whereas Tiraspol's influence on the 14th Army would virtually be 
reduced to zero.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has 
condemned "ethnic cleansing," which he believes is being carried 
out in Estonia and Latvia. 
  He said in response to journalists' questions put to him 
before his departure to Tashkent and Almaty: "Approximately one 
third of the population (in Estonia and Latvia -- IF) is marked 
by ethnic belonging. This is to say the Russian-speaking 
population -- Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews, and even 
Finns who are refused citizenship. They would like to acquire 
such citizenship. They are refused for only one reason -- the 
ethnic one. If this is not ethnic cleansing, then what would 
you call it?" 
  "If people are called `occupants' and `aliens,' they start 
to 
act that way. This results in instability," the foreign 
minister emphasized. 
  He mentioned another example proving the violation of the 
Russian-speaking population's human rights. "Everyone was to 
serve in the army in the former USSR. Now they want to 
expatriate from Estonia and Latvia not all former Soviet 
servicemen but only Russian-speaking ones. It is obvious that 
this has been based on ethnic reasons rather than political 
ones," Kozyrev remarked. 
  In his words, "the attempts to repay ordinary people for the 
Stalin regime's crimes were political stupidity." "I recognize 
that the Stalin regime did commit crimes. However, we cannot 
forget that they were committed by the political power -- Stalin 
on the one hand and Hitler on the other, who had concluded the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It is unacceptable that thousands of 
ordinary people have to pay for these crimes 45 years later and 
that the ethnic principle is used." 
  Kozyrev pointed out that Russia could not remain indifferent 
to all that was happening near its borders. "The world must pay 
attention to this inhuman and potentially dangerous situation," 
the Russian foreign minister concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov under the "Postscriptum: Events </F>
and Commentaries" rubric: "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back. 
The Results of the 16th Round of Russian-Estonian Talks Are 
Very Modest, If Not...."] 
  [Text] Talks between Russian and Estonian state 
delegations were held in the Moscow region 1-2 February. As 
Vasiliy Svirin, head of the Russian delegation, stressed, the 
Russian delegation went to the talks with the intention of 
working for tangible progress but these hopes were only partly 
realized. The fruitful first day of the talks was completely 
nullified by the deadlock on day two. 
  Vasiliy Svirin noted that significant progress was achieved 
in the preparation of the main treaty on the withdrawal of the 
Russian troops from Estonia and the terms of their temporary 
presence on the republic's territory. There is every reason to 
believe that it will be initialed by the two states' delegations 
in the near future. 
  The agreement on the social protection of Russian military 
pensioners and members of their families was examined in 
conjunction with the treaty on the troop withdrawal. It was a 
cause of great disappointment that the Estonian delegation 
adopted a tough and intransigent stance here which made it 
impossible to achieve even minor positive results. Estonia is 
demanding that military pensioners who retired after 20 December 
1991 leave the republic, regardless of whether they have 
apartments or not. Taken together with members of their 
families, that amounts to 44,000 people. Those who were 
discharged earlier have the right only to apply for a residence 
permit [vid na zhitelstvo]. However, according to the Estonian 
Republic Government's decree dated 1 December 1992, this 
application must be accompanied by the fulfillment of a number 
of demeaning requirements. 
  The lack of an accord on the Agreement on the Social 
Protection of Military Pensioners was the reason for the refusal 
to transfer to the Estonian side the timetable for the Russian 
troop withdrawal which has already been prepared. 
  The discussion of the problem of citizenship may also be 
counted among the failures of the latest round of talks. A long 
time ago the Russian delegation prepared a draft treaty which 
proposes that Russians living in Estonia and Estonians living in 
Russia be afforded the opportunity to acquire Russian or 
Estonian citizenship. But the Estonian delegation again avoided 
concrete work on this document. 
  The Russian and Estonian delegations also discussed a broad 
range of border questions. The Estonian delegation blocked all 
discussion of the question of the land border and is refusing 
proposals on its demarcation. This is due to the fact that 
Estonia is continuing its attempts to make territorial claims on 
Russia. In the words of the Russian diplomat, these claims are 
futile. Furthermore, Vasiliy Svirin added, if Estonia does not 
react in the future to proposals to carry out the demarcation of 
the border Russia will be forced to do that unilaterally.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Zheglov report: "Russia-France: New Level of </F>
Military Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Analysis of the Yugoslav crisis, the concept of the 
architecture of European security, Russia's attitude to the 
"Partnership for Peace" program, and the state of and prospects 
for Franco-Russian military cooperation were the main topics of 
the conversation between Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian 
defense minister, and Francois Leotard, head of France's 
military department, 4 February at the Russian Defense Ministry. 
  Our military contacts are regular and go back a long way, 
Pavel Grachev stressed. Franco-Russian combat fellowship 
developed during World Wars I and II. 
  The signing of two intergovernmental agreements -- on 
defense 
cooperation and military-technical cooperation -- came as fresh 
confirmation of the further strengthening of Franco-Russian 
friendship. They make provision not only for collaboration 
between our states' military departments and armed forces, but 
also exchanges of experience in the field of defense enterprise 
conversion, for instance, and the development of certain arms. 
The agreement on military-technical cooperation envisages the 
implementation of 20 specific projects in total. 
  For Russia the signing of these agreements is all the more 
important in that they have been concluded with a NATO state. 
And it was underlined during the conversation that this is 
evidence of the new level of relations between Russia and the 
North Atlantic alliance and represents our country's concrete 
contribution to the implementation of the "Partnership for 
Peace" program. 
  A considerable part of the conversation was devoted to 
Russia's peacekeeping activity. I must be blunt and say, Pavel 
Grachev stated here, that the world is still not sufficiently 
objective in its perception of the Russian Armed Forces' 
peacekeeping efforts. People there often forget that the former 
Soviet republics are autonomous states. That is why the armed 
conflicts on their territories and the Russian Army's 
peacekeeping operations go unnoticed. Furthermore, our country 
is accused of not displaying activity in the republics of the 
former Yugoslavia, acting under the UN flag, and that its troop 
contingent there is very small. 
  However, Pavel Grachev said, our Army is carrying out 
peacekeeping operations in Moldova, the Transcaucasus, and 
Tajikistan. Over 16,000 Russian servicemen have been deployed 
to carry out these tasks alone and that is more than any of the 
national contingents involved in UN peacekeeping operations. At 
present the question of the preparation and introduction of 
peacekeeping subunits of the Russian Armed Forces into the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone with the participation of UN 
observers is being studied. 
  Touching on the settlement of the Bosnian crisis, the head 
of 
the Russian military department pointed, in particular, to 
Russia's commitment to finding a most speedy political solution 
to this problem. 
  In the opinion of the Russian side, combat use of aviation 
would cause hostilities in the region to escalate. Therefore 
aircraft can only be used if UN troops are directly attacked. 
What is more, the possibility of using force in Bosnia should 
be decided by the UN Security Council, and not other 
organizations. Russia's defense minister also opposed lifting 
the embargo on arms shipments to the conflict zone. 
  Francois Leotard and Pavel Grachev visited the Taman Guards 
Motorized Rifle Division 4 February, where they inspected arms 
and combat hardware and were briefed on personnel's life and 
living conditions.

<F P=106> [Report by special Moscow correspondent Jacques Isnard: "Mr. </F>
Kozyrev Suspects Western Countries of Wishing To `Punish the 
Serbs Alone' by Air Raids"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Receiving French Defense Minister Leotard 
before the shelling of the Sarajevo market, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev expressed the suspicion that the Western 
countries want to "punish the Serbs alone" by means of air raids 
which Russian Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev rules out 
because such "bombing raids" are only justified in the West by 
situations which he describes as "artificial" and "exaggerated." 
  It was in the plane bringing him back to France on the 
afternoon of Saturday 5 February after a three-day visit to 
Moscow that the French defense minister learned of the massacre 
at the Sarajevo market, one of the six areas in Bosnia protected 
by the United Nations and now under fire from 188 Serbian guns 
according to French intelligence. 
  Invited by Gen. Pavel Grachev, his Russian counterpart, with 
whom he visited the Taman mechanized infantry division, Francois 
Leotard tried at the end of last week to convince his 
interlocutors -- who included Oleg Soskovets, first deputy 
chairman of the council of ministers, Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, and 
General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of general staff -- of the 
need for air support for the humanitarian bridge to Tuzla and 
Srebrenica, two of the other areas placed by mandate under UN 
protection. 
  Mr. Leotard thought he detected a slight difference in tone 
in the statements of Mr. Kozyrev, the diplomat, and Gen. 
Grachev, the soldier. The former struck him as "less peremptory 
and less stubborn" than the latter. The French minister told 
Mr. Kozyrev that an air operation backed by the United Nations, 
under the terms of a resolution already approved by the Russians 
and requested, if necessary, by the local UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] officials, is not aggressive because it would 
be "close air support" intended to accompany humanitarian aid to 
prevent it from being attacked. It is not "an Iraqi concept" 
Mr. Leotard explained, referring to the 1991 raids on Baghdad. 
Mr. Kozyrev agreed that it is necessary to avoid any quarrel on 
terminology and that more detailed explanation should be 
continued. However, he suspects the big Western powers at the 
United Nations of "wishing to punish the Serbs alone" by these 
actions. 
<H5>  New Military Doctrine </H5>
  Mr. Leotard also suggested to the Russian foreign minister 
that Moscow should support the attitude of France which is 
seeking to obtain the international community's "impartiality" 
and "neutrality" in the Yugoslav conflict. Starting with the 
United States. Without having any formal proof of this, the 
French suspect the Americans of arming the Bosnian Muslims by 
secret supplies, as they did in Afghanistan. 
  This French request for Russia's cooperation is strange to 
say the least, addressed to a country which, as Mr. Leotard's 
entourage admits, makes no secret of its pro-Serbian sympathies 
-- although it denies that -- or of its desire as a European and 
Slav power to reestablish a more active diplomacy in the region 
after three years of low profile. 
  With Gen. Grachev, however, the dialogue was more closely 
argued. The Russian defense minister thinks that the use of 
fighter planes "could lead to an escalation" on the ground and 
that these are "bombing raids" aimed at "exerting pressure on 
the Serbian side" in situations -- the Tuzla and Srebrenica 
areas -- which are "artificial" and "exaggerated" for 
demonstration purposes. Gen. Grachev therefore rules out any 
"bombing" of Tuzla. His French interlocutors had the feeling 
that he was also opposed to it in that, to carry out such 
actions in the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations chose 
NATO's structures and military resources as its secular arm. 
  In an indirect but fairly convincing way, these discussions 
between Russians and French on the Balkan crisis also revealed 
the ambiguity of the new military doctrine adopted in November 
1993 by Moscow. Mr. Leotard was given a commentary on this text 
by Gen. Grachev and Gen. Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian 
Security Council. Indeed, in light of what is happening in 
Bosnia, but also in Moldova, in the Transcaucasus, in 
Tajikistan, or in Georgia, for instance, two more specific 
points should warrant greater attention from the Western general 
staffs. 
  The first of these aspects apparently relates to the 
difficulty which the Russian military have in designing 
defensive actions, although their new doctrine is intended to be 
based resolutely on operations of a nonoffensive nature. 
<H5>  Concept of `Nearby Foreign Countries' </H5>
  The confusion -- if it is unintentional -- which the 
Russians 
are maintaining between a bombing raid (which can be a 
deliberately aggressive action) and air support (which amounts 
to prevention of a possible provocation) suggests that they do 
not share this distinction, which is usual in the Western 
general staffs and that they have stuck to their previous 
concept based on the offensive. 
  The second point seems even more fraught with 
misunderstandings. It relates to the idea which the Russians 
have of what is called the security "architecture" in Europe 
and, through this collective notion, the security area proper to 
their country and the sphere recognized as that of "nearby 
foreign countries" [countries of the former Soviet Union] 
according to an expression used in their new doctrine. In other 
words, as Mr. Leotard asked his interlocutors, when and where 
does Russia's security start if it does not want to be accused 
of making the limits of its interests coincide with the borders 
of the former Soviet Union? 
  The answers may have varied from one interlocutor to 
another, 
but they were close in substance. According to Gen. Lobov, 
Russia has 60,000 km of borders to protect -- half of which are 
not currently protected -- and, with its 2.1 million men under 
arms in 1995, it would respond to the countries which might seek 
its aid. According to Gen. Grachev, Russia is the only state in 
the world to have currently deployed so many "peace soldiers" 
(1,200 "blue helmets" in the former Yugoslavia and 16,000 of its 
men in Moldova, the Trancaucasus, or Tajikistan without any UN 
mandate). In reply to the Russian minister who wanted France to 
send observers to Georgia under UN auspices, Mr. Leotard said 
that it would send around six "White Helmets" of the 55 
originally planned. 
  Mr. Kozyrev, for his part, summed up the Russian position on 
"nearby foreign countries" by rejecting the accusation of 
"imperialism" or a return to Greater Russia which has often been 
made against his country's military doctrine. He asked Mr. 
Leotard how, from this viewpoint, France justified "the legal 
basis" of its military presence in Africa. He expressed the 
hope that he should be sent -- as a source of inspiration if 
necessary -- the defense agreements on which France bases its 
interventions on that continent. 
  Despite the many differences of opinion, Gen. Grachev and 
the 
French defense minister nonetheless signed two framework 
cooperation agreements one of which -- by far the most important 
-- establishes the conditions in which France will help to 
renovate old Mig-21's, delivered for export, and to produce a 
twin-jet training plane called the Mig-AT [Advanced Trainer].

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Leonid Vorontsov and Alexey </F>
Korinenko] 
  [Text] Berlin February 8 TASS -- German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl said he firmly believes Russian President Boris Yeltsin is 
determined to implement reform in Russia, although not in the 
ways suggested by some Harvard professors who created a 
theoretical model. Yeltsin proceeds from a specific situation 
in Russia. Kohl said this in interview to SAT-1 television 
network transmitted on Monday evening. The reforms will 
apparently not be so rapid. 
  Kohl said his conversation with Yeltsin and the Russian 
president's supporters make him realise that they represent a 
proud nation and proud country with great history and 
traditions. Kohl spoke highly of the recent visit to Moscow by 
U.S. President Bill Clinton who showed respect for the people of 
Russia that remains a great power and also showed the striving 
for cooperation and aid. But this aid should not be self-aid, 
the German chancellor said. 
  Regarding the situation in former Yugoslavia, Kohl stated 
Germany's position of principle. It refrains from sending 
troops into the region. First of all, this is not allowed by 
the German Constitution, the chancellor said, pointing to the 
need to amend the Constitution. But even if the Constitution 
permitted sending troops into former Yugoslavia, Germans, for 
historic reasons, would not be suitable partners. 
  Kohl declared again for a quest of political solution to the 
problem and stressed that the forcible change of the existing 
frontiers is impermissible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian </F>
Liberal Democratic Party, by unidentified reporter; place and 
date not given: "God Has Dictated That We Be Friends"] 
  [Text] [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Mr. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, what 
do you feel when you think about Germany? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] When I think about Germany, whether during 
the day or during the night, then I feel respect and a certain 
affinity. My heart tells me that our peoples are very similar 
and belong together as friends. Reason tells me that long-term 
peace can be secured in Europe if both Germans and Russians want 
that and will not allow themselves to be set against each other. 
My understanding of history also tells me that the lesson that 
is to be drawn from two murderous wars in which the Germans and 
Russians inflicted horrific losses on each other can only be to 
return to traditional German-Russian friendship, which was a 
blessing for our peoples in all areas for hundreds of years. 
  [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] The media, especially in Germany, are 
overjoyed that criminal proceedings have been instituted against 
you in Russia for "war-mongering." 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Some people filed reports with the 
authorities 
and there are, of course, forces that want to eliminate me. My 
friend Dr. Frey has had criminal proceedings instituted against 
him 600 times and has never been sentenced. I have done nothing 
wrong. The Russian people and the Russian Army know that I 
adhere to the law and that I serve the interests of the Russian 
people, its right to exist with all my strength. 
<H5>  Gutter Journalism </H5>
  [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] The press, radio, and television in 
Germany have been trying to outdo each other in a concerted 
campaign aimed at turning opinion against you. You are depicted 
as an enemy of Germany. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Over the past 50 years, Germany has seen many 
foreign politicians who have been anything but friends of the 
German people. The more some people stirred up hatred against 
Germany, the more humble and submissive was the response. I 
cannot recall one foreign politician who has thought or 
expressed himself about the Germans in a friendlier or warmer 
fashion than I. 
  I do not agree with de Gaulle's words that "the Germans are 
poor bastards, because they have been ruined." However, I do 
get the impression that the brain-washing of re-education, which 
has been going on for almost 50 years, has caused psychological, 
even pathological changes in many Germans. For example, Mrs. 
Thatcher writes in her memoirs in an epic manner about how she 
and Mitterrand sought to prevent the unification of the Federal 
Republic and the GDR, and for some people in the FRG, they are 
considered prototypes of modern Germany's friends. However, 
when I talk of reaching agreement on a settlement of the East 
Prussia issue in a way that will be to the advantage of Germany 
and when I also say that history has not said its last word 
about the terrible injustice of the Oder-Neisse line, which I 
believe can be revised through peaceful negotiations, then I am 
portrayed as some evil demon from hell and a fanatical enemy of 
Germany. 
<H5>  Is National Masochism Something Attractive? </H5>
  [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] The media are really producing a 
surfeit.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] ....of gutter journalism. However, in the 
Russian parliamentary elections, which were held in December, 
every fourth person who cast a valid vote voted for me, and the 
Liberal Democrats, whom I lead, are by far the strongest party 
in Russia. The sick, fantastic stories that are being spread 
about me by the media outside Russia will not stop one single 
Russian from voting for me. In fact, it will have the opposite 
effect. The international media outside Russia can indeed 
poison the political climate, but they can in no way influence 
the course of things in Russia. The Russian people and the 
Russian Army are behind me, and I have become the strongest 
element in free elections. That is something that cannot be 
said of Brezhnev or Honecker, regardless of how much one may 
want to. Nevertheless, the West German media and West German 
politicians sang the praises of both of them -- men who wanted 
Germany to remain divided forever, and they thoroughly enjoyed 
continually dropping to their knees and making gestures of 
submission. Is that not strange? 
  [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] It is indeed strange, but at the same 
time, it is indicative of the prevailing attitude of the media, 
which want to undermine German confidence through a one-sided 
approach to dealing with the past, by developing ideas of 
"collective responsibility" and "collective liability" that also 
apply to Germans who have not been born yet. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I do not understand how the great German 
people can accept that. Is national masochism that attractive? 
Why should such masochistic exercises apply only to one people 
on this planet, while the rest of the international community 
would not even dream of being prepared to make prisoners of 
themselves in a similar way? 
<H5>  No One Can Be That Stupid </H5>
  From the very outset, I and my friend Dr. Frey agreed that 
we 
would not level accusations at each other concerning guilt and 
that we would trade no such charges regarding the past. Dr. 
Frey was born after the Nazi seizure of power and I was born 
after World War II. There are many horrific and difficult 
problems to be dealt with at the present time. We cannot change 
the past, but we can try to make the present better and to 
master the future. That entails a good German-Russian 
relationship in every respect. What I would also add to the 
relationship is a rapprochement in the sense of the Bismarckian 
Reinsurance Treaty. In my case, Germany's reinsurance treaty is 
Gerhard Frey. 
  [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Much of the German media has sought to 
create the impression that at the joint news conference at the 
Duma on Wednesday of last week, there were all kinds of attacks 
against Germany. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] As everyone knows, there exists a sincere 
friendship between me and Dr. Frey. We discussed all the issues 
that interest us in a spirit of harmony during Dr. Frey's visit 
to Moscow at my invitation from Tuesday to Thursday of last 
week. How stupid must one be to believe that Gerhard Frey, who 
has fought for the good of Germany all his life and suffered 
exceptional persecution as a result, would appear with me at 
news conference in Moscow or anywhere else and listen to or 
accept the slightest negative remark about the German people. 
There cannot be anyone that stupid on this planet! If there is 
an idiot who believes that anywhere, then he should seek 
treatment from a psychiatrist as quickly as possible. 
<H5>  They Want Germany To Be Bound </H5>
  At the news conference, which lasted almost two hours and 
took place before dozens of TV crews and hundreds of journalists 
from all over the world, Dr. Frey and I staged a real fireworks 
display of pro-German projects and policies of the kind that has 
certainly never been seen at the U.S. Congress, the British 
House of Commons, or the French National Assembly. I have 
proposed a joint German-Russian project for the construction of 
a highway linking Berlin and Moscow via Koenigsberg 
[Kaliningrad], that German should become the principle foreign 
language taught throughout Russia, that our students should 
participate in large-scale exchange programs, and that there 
should be a free cultural exchange between our countries. I have 
proposed that Germany play the leading role in the extraction of 
our mineral wealth, in our industry, and in joint defense 
projects. 
  [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] You always say in German and in Russian: 
Germans and Russians -- friends forever. You said that at the 
DVU [German People's Union] rallies and press conferences in 
1992 and 1993, at the Liberal Democrats rallies and news 
conferences in 1992 and 1993, and now you have said so again. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] If I perhaps said that 20 or 25 times at our 
joint news conference at the Duma last week, then that will make 
me mortal enemy number one for the anti-German media in Germany. 
There are evidently forces outside Germany who are interested 
in preventing German-Russian friendship by every possible means. 
Germany should be bound, and remain deprived of its full 
sovereignty. 
  However, if the two greatest and strongest nations in Europe 
stand together as brothers, then security and peace are 
guaranteed. That is essentially so simple, so clear, so obvious, 
and irrefutable that anyone of goodwill must comprehend it. I 
said that just as clearly at the DVU rally in the 
Nibelungenhalle in Passau. There is a video of the rally -- 
"Passau '93: Germany Must Live!" -- which contains my entire 
speech. Anyone who listens to that speech and still doubts 
whether I am a great friend of Germany must be mad in the best 
case and is more probably an enemy of Germany. 
<H5>  Con Men Without Scruples </H5>
  [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Our media are spreading all kinds of 
fantastic stories about how you want to address a small splinter 
group at the so-called European Congress in Cologne. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] People all over the world want to jump onto 
the bandwagon now. Some unscrupulous con men tell press 
agencies and other media that I will attend some event organized 
by them. In accordance with current "political standards," the 
press does not take the trouble to consult my colleagues, but 
diligently spreads the false report. I would not deal with such 
people in my wildest dreams, to come to Cologne and so on. I 
have also ignored other invitations, some were for the middle of 
January. I have discussed a whole series of further, sometimes 
large-scale events organized by the Liberal Democrats and the 
DVU with Dr. Frey. 
  [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Along with Dr. Frey, you laid flowers at 
the monument to those who died in the struggle against French 
imperialism in memory of our comradeship in arms and our 
national heroes in liberating Europe from Napoleon I. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We must recall the great periods in our 
common history and thus show Russians and Germans symbols for 
the present and the future. God has dictated that we be friends.

  [Text] Warsaw February 7 TASS -- Russia and Poland agreed 
on Monday to boost cooperation in fighting organised crime. 
  Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin, who is on a visit in 
Warsaw, told ITAR-TASS that "our cooperation has reached such a 
level that the time has come for joint activities of Russian and 
Polish Interior Ministry bodies to combat organised crime." 
  He said this is the time for discussing concrete operations. 
Information exchange and coordinated activities have helped 
Russian and Polish law enforcement bodies solve a series of 
crimes, including car thefts. 
  Polish Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski stressed the 
need for both countries to increase cooperation especially in 
combating organised crime and illegal drug trafficking. He said 
an agreement had been reached to exchange permanent 
representatives to maintain contacts between the Interior 
Ministries of the two countries. 
  During the three-day visit that ended on Monday, Yerin was 
also received by Polish President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak. 
  The Russian delegation visited several special police and 
Interior Ministry troops units.

  [Text] Mexico City February 8 TASS -- An agreement on 
cultural and scientific cooperation and a programme specifying 
the agreement's provisions were initialed here on Monday at a 
meeting of a mixed commission for cultural cooperation. The 
purpose of the documents is to strengthen and broaden bilateral 
contacts between Mexico and Russia on a new legal-treaty basis. 
  The initialling, that is the coordination of a common 
concept 
of the two documents, enables the state institutions of Russia 
and Mexico to launch practical preparations for exchanges of 
performing groups, museum exhibitions and delegations of partner 
cities, Yuriy Korchagin, representative of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, who attended the commission's session, told ITAR-TASS. 
  The programme for specific bilateral measures in these areas 
of cooperation also provides for financial and technical 
assistance in the establishment of direct contacts between 
higher learning establishments, cultural, sports and other 
organisations of Mexico and Russia. 
  Nikolay Bespalov, charge d'affaires ad interim of the 
Russian 
Federation to this Latin American country, is of the opinion 
that Mexico shows greate interest in the development of mutually 
beneficial cooperation with Russia in culture, education and 
sports, cooperation which has somewhat slowed down since the 
break-up of the Soviet Union. 
  The lack of a new legal basis for the stimulation of such 
contacts led to a paradoxical situation. At a time when many 
prominent Russian groups and performers began to frequent Mexico 
for guest tours on a commercial basis, Russia was not actually 
represented in recent years at big international art festivals 
here, such as, for example, the world-famed Servantino, Bespalov 
said.

<F P=106> [Sergey Bunin report: "Catch Fish, But Stick to the Quotas. </F>
Testimony of Commander in Chief of Russian Border Troops A. 
Nikolayev"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, 4 Feb -- A videotape shown to us at the 
Russian Embassy in Tokyo concerned events of 21-22 January. On 
that day our territorial waters in the region of the South 
Kurils were subjected to wholesale invasion by Japanese 
fishermen, and a statement ensued from the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
  The "pirates" -- and there is no other word for them -- 
crossed the notional border from three directions at once, 
having first built up a cruising speed of 40-45 knots (almost 90 
km per hour!). Cutting through the waves, they plowed in 
disorderly fashion through the narrow waters of the strait 
separating the island of Kunashir from Japan's Hokkaido. A 
border troops helicopter, approaching each of the fishing 
schooners in turn, recorded the numbers and names of the vessels 
-- NK2-20234, NK-218355, NK-18021, NK2-22134..., Kosio-maru, 
Tayio-maru, Nogisinko-maru.... These are just a few of the data 
I managed to note down. The camera also recorded the spasmodic 
attempts of some of the crew to conceal the numbers in makeshift 
fashion with sheets of some kind. The "haul" was respectable -- 
in two days Russian border troops recorded 130 incidents of the 
insolent procession of Japanese schooners under the helicopter 
patrol, which was carrying out duty aerial patrol of the border 
waters. 
  "There is every basis to believe that this was a planned, 
political action" -- this was the comment on the filmed events 
by the commander in chief of the Russian Border Troops himself, 
Colonel General Nikolayev, who assembled Russian journalists, 
including myself, in the embassy to view the video and discuss 
the results of the recently completed trilateral forum of 
Russia, Japan, and the United States on maintaining security in 
the northern Pacific. "How otherwise do we explain the fact 
that there were virtually no other violations either before or 
after these events in January? You could hardly call this a 
coincidence. The Japanese authorities could not be unaware of 
this -- the border troops pinpointed three ships of the Japanese 
Defense Agency at sea, calmly observing what was happening not 
far from their own territorial waters. Will we pass this 
material to the relevant Japanese organs? So far no one has 
asked us to do so. But if an official request is received, 
there are no problems." 
  No such request, evidently, will be received. The Japanese 
side, whatever officials say by way of justification, knows full 
well about all the violations. Following the strongly worded 
statement from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tokyo 
finally set up an investigation into the protest. So far only 
something indistinct along the lines of "We have not confirmed 
such incidents" has been heard. 
  To all our protests the Japanese stubbornly repeat: But we 
want to fish. No problem! There exists an agreed quota -- 
fish, and good luck to you! We are not against economic 
activity in these waters. But when, disregarding Russia's 
national interests, the violation of borders and quotas 
continues, we will act on the basis of the law on the state 
border -- in full accordance with and to the full extent of 
international law. And that includes the use of weapons. 
  "The incident involving the detention of two fishing 
schooners at the end of last year is only an episode blown up 
out of all proportion by the Japanese newspapers," Nikolayev 
said. "But altogether 1993 was marked by an unprecedented 
upsurge in piratical activity -- 7,000 violations by Japanese 
fisherman of the Russian border in this region." 
  Have these incidents been specifically examined with the 
Japanese departments during visits to Tokyo? This is not yet 
being disclosed. 
  "I can say only one thing," the commander in chief stated in 
conclusion. "This is a sensitive issue for the Japanese. The 
main think is, that, in my opinion, they have ascertained for 
themselves that the Border Troops will continue their official 
combat activity in these waters. The Border Troops now have 
sufficient fuel. They are also sufficiently equipped with video 
equipment. The Japanese are law-abiding people, and must 
finally understand that we will not condone smuggling, the 
poaching of fish resources, or the violation of borders -- no 
one has given them carte blanche for that. We have offered them 
cooperation -- in that case it would be possible to avoid many 
questions and conflicts."

  [Text] Commander of the anti-Dudayev armed formations 
General Ibragim Suleymenov stated that reconciliation with the 
Chechen regime was only possible on the following terms: 
immediate and unconditional resignation of Dzhokhar Dudayev, 
the return of the capital from foreign banks (about $1 Bn) and 
proportional distribution of this capital among the population, 
and putting Dudayev on Shariat and secular trial. 
  On Monday, Suleymenov made a corresponding statement which 
was circulated in Moscow on Monday by the armed opposition's 
spokesman Zanbek Aliyev. He said that the Suleymenov-controlled 
units had started military maneuvers in Chechnya last Friday to 
improve interaction between units and rehearse bomb attacks on 
land targets. 
  Suleymenov was a deputy in the Chechen parliament disbanded 
by Dudayev in June 1993.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Andrey Illarionov, head of the Russian prime 
minister's analysis and planning group, who is in fact the prime 
minister's expert adviser, said today that the present 
government has in fact commenced the economic and political 
restoration under the guise of continuing to press on with the 
amended reforms. 
  Our correspondent met Andrey Illarionov. 
  [Begin recording] [Illarionov] The government has 
unequivocally announced a turnaround in its economic policy, in 
specific deeds and in words alike. This coup, or this 
turnaround in economic policy, has in fact already been 
accomplished. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Illarionov says the decision to 
merge the Russian and Belarusian currencies, the allocation of 
enormous resources for the agro-industrial lobby, and a number 
of other decisions force the country to face the danger of an 
unchecked growth in inflation. 
  [Illarionov] Toward the end of 1993 the government set 
itself 
the goal, the main goal for the end of 1993, to bring inflation 
down to between 3 and 5 percent. In January this goal was 
altered to between 7 and 9 percent. In Davos, the prime 
minister spoke of between 15 and 18 percent. At the last 
government sitting the figure of 20 percent was mentioned. 
  [Correspondent] According to Illarionov's predictions, this 
will lead the country toward the Ukrainization of its economy 
over the next few months. Moreover, what is in store for Russia 
is a highly monopolized market with a strong state influence in 
all areas, including the setting of prices. A letter of 
resignation was this evening sent to Viktor Chernomyrdin. So 
far, there has been no answer. [end recording] 
  In his letter to Viktor Chernomyrdin, Illarionov points out 
that recently the government has rejected the services of 
specialists and advisers, and as a consequence of this, 
according to Illarionov, very strange statements have been made 
about the non-monetarist methods of combatting inflation, the 
fluctuating and ongoing inflation, the hyper-decline of the 
shock therapy, and this, in Illarionov's view, discredits not 
just the prime minister but also any person involved in the 
government apparatus, and Illarionov regrets to note that 
Vasiliy Starodubtsev is among the prime minister's present 
advisers.

  [Text] The visit to Moscow by Kazakhstani President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev scheduled for 12 February has again been 
postponed indefinitely. The plan was to meet Boris Yeltin in 
Moscow en route for New York, but now Nursultan Nazarbayev has 
canceled that, we were told today by the Kazakhstani president's 
press service. Andrey Kondrashov reports. 
  [Kondrashov] This latest rejection by the president of 
Kazakhstan is not, as it seemed, linked to the upcoming visit to 
Almaty by Andrey Kozyrev. The Kazakh leader canceled his talks 
with the Russian president much earlier. In addition, the 
arrival of Russia's Foreign Ministry chief in the republic will 
not by any means resolve all the problems between the two states. 
  Observers put this down to Kazakhstan's unwillingness to 
hold 
talks on military cooperation in particular. 
  The stumbling block, as before, is Baykonur. Kazakhstan does 
not want to lease it to Russia on the previous terms. Having 
declared the space site to be its own property, the republic 
wants, I quote, to hive off only the military part of it for the 
Russian military, leaving the civilian part for itself to put to 
commercial use. 
  Since Russia continues to maintain all of Baykonur, it quite 
naturally sees this option as unacceptable. Moreover, the 
duration of the lease on Baykonur and the cosmodrome's status 
have yet to be decided. In addition to this, the very presence 
of Russian military units on Kazakhstan territory is a breach of 
the constitution. And, Kazakhstan has still not elected a 
parliament settle the issue. 
  It looks as if Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Almaty has simpler 
aims. Even before his arrival, Nursultan Nazarbayev announced 
that Kozyrev will not get him to introduce dual citizenship. 
However, the president of Kazakhstan has in advance drawn up a 
compromise for Russia. Instead of dual citizenship, he intends 
to propose to Andrey Kozyrev a simplified procedure for 
Kazakhstan's ethnic Russians to obtain Russian citizenship.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 07, BNS -- Latvian President Guntis 
Ulmanis received a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton 
Monday [7 February], praising activities by the Latvian 
parliament delegation, which toured Washington last week to 
consult on security issues. 
  The letter was handed over by U.S. Ambassador Ints Silins. 
  The thoughtful preparations for the visit and the 
comprehensively represented political spectrum ensured an 
efficient exchange of information on the Russian troops 
withdrawal and the status of the Skrunda radar in Latvia, 
according to the letter. 
  The visit opened a door for progress in Latvian-Russian 
interstate talks. It will help settle the troops withdrawal and 
the Skrunda problem soon and improve relations between Latvia 
and Russia, Clinton said. 
  As reported, the Latvian delegation, led by Foreign Minister 
Georgs Andrejevs, met with President Clinton and other 
high-ranking officials to get advise on security-related 
problems. 
  The American leaders said their country could help monitor 
implementing of a withdrawal agreement if Latvia compromised 
with Russia on the terms of withdrawal. 
  Latvia should accept Russia's proposal to get all troops out 
by the end of August and allow Russia to operate the 
early-warning radar in Skrunda for four more years and dismantle 
the installation in 18 months after the term expires, they said. 
  Latvia has rescheduled talks with Russia from Feb. 7 to Feb. 
21 to contemplate the U.S. recommendation.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] Russia stands categorically against attacks of 
retaliation on any of the parties involved in the Bosnian 
conflict if such an attack is not within "the context of 
defense" of the UN forces in the former Yugoslavia. This was 
said by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before his 
departure to Tashkent on Monday evening. 
  However, the Russian foreign minister admitted that there 
might be an attack if the UN peacekeeping forces were attacked. 
"In this case, the UN forces' command in Bosnia must make a 
proposal on military support, including one by air forces, to 
the UN Secretary-General who is to conduct consultations with 
the Security Council's permanent member-states, including 
Russia," the foreign minister clarified. 
  In his words, it was "absolutely necessary" to defend the UN 
peacekeeping forces stationed in the areas of conflicts. "If 
Bosnian Serbs, Moslems or Croats launch an attack, in response 
the international community may apply the appropriate measures 
against them," the Russian foreign minister said. 
  He pointed out that "there was no way to speak about attacks 
only against Serbs in the specific situation which has emerged 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Only the defense from an attack 
committed by any party can be discussed," Kozyrev emphasized. 
  In his words, the current situation is "very unfavorable for 
any kind of air attacks." "We will examine all the details. 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make decisions on all 
specific situations. However, in principle, counting on force 
is not the most successful way out," the foreign minister 
pointed out. 
  Kozyrev regretted that "some of our western partners were in 
a hurry and did not study the Russian program of a settlement in 
Bosnia properly." "Our initiative provided for convening the 
Security Council, reinforcing the security zones around Sarajevo 
and elsewhere, putting that city under UN control, and 
demilitarizing Sarajevo and its surroundings by both sides. If 
the initiative had taken effect, the latest tragedy in that city 
could have been avoided. No one can say who caused such a huge 
toll of lives. Unfortunately, as long as Moslems and Serbs are 
amassing their artillery guns, similar tragedies cannot be 
avoided," Kozyrev said. 
  He urged the need for effective measures "not to get caught 
in a trap." "It was a well-placed trap and possibly a 
provocation by one of the sides. The incident must be 
investigated, and concrete measures must be taken, he said. 
  The minister recalled that "the death of Prince Ferdinand 
through a provocation in Sarajevo in 1913 triggered off a global 
tragedy." "That tragedy did not solve the Balkan issue, still 
facing us today. For this reason, the escalation of violence in 
the form of air strikes or any other foreign intervention except 
that by the UN would most likely lead to a repetition of that 
notorious tragic scenario," Kozyrev said. 
  In his words, "no one wants it." "That is why I think that 
the international community will be guided (with all the heated 
discussion and the indignation that we fully share) by common 
sense and political reason rather than by emotions," he remarked. 
  Kozyrev believes that "time has come for our western 
partners 
in the Security Council to take a closer look at the Russian 
proposals. It is possible to adopt effective measures on 
Sarajevo by disengaging the troops to avoid violence rather than 
by air strikes that would escalate it," the foreign minister 
declared. He disclosed that he had discussed the problem with 
his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher Sunday night. 
  He noted that a map to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina "was agreed 
to in principle. There may be only 5 percent that remains for 
the sides to agree on. Their argument can last endlessly. But 
there is a way out for them through international arbitration at 
the level of the UN Security Council, the Hague Court, or any 
other authoritative body," he said. 
  Asked by an Interfax correspondent whether Russia would back 
up sanctions against Croatia, Kozyrev replied: "Sanctions are 
not the best way. Once agreements on a settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are signed and concrete steps to implement 
them are taken, the best thing would be to lift sanctions even 
against Yugoslavia rather than to impose new ones." 
  However, he noted, "if Croatia continues outright 
interference, sends troops to Bosnia and becomes directly 
involved in the conflict there, the imposition of sanctions on 
Zagreb may be considered. Would we like that? Of course not. 
Because Croatian civilians would suffer as a result. Whether 
such a turn of events is avoided will depend on how restrained 
the Croatian authorities will be," the minister stressed. 
  The decision to bomb Serb positions in Bosnia must not be 
taken until an unbiased international commission evaluates the 
circumstances of the tragic explosion in Sarajevo, the head of 
the State Duma committee for international affairs, Vladimir 
Lukin, told journalists on Monday. According to him, such a 
commission must include neither Europarliament representatives 
nor Mr. Zhirinovskiy. 
  As Lukin said, the UN Secretary-General, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, 
displayed "some prejudice," when he suggested that NATO 
structures should consider the possibility of bombing Serb 
positions. According to the Russian parliamentarian, the UN 
Security Council should convene all its members to discuss the 
situation, and "it would be odd if Russia were excluded from 
this process." 
  The State Duma, Lukin said, has already issued a statement 
on 
the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and it continues to 
believe that "intensified military actions will not lead to 
slackening hostilities, and bombardments with greater outside 
military interference will not yield positive results." 
  Lukin pointed out that he himself does not share "the 
extremist circles' opinion that the Serbs, or, on the contrary, 
the Muslims, are presumed to be right." According to him, there 
is a need to "find out objectively what is the best way to reach 
a political solution" to the conflict in Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under general heading: "Another Shot </F>
Has Rung Out in Sarajevo"] 
  [Text] Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister of foreign affairs: 
  "What has happened in Sarajevo is a tragic and disgraceful 
event in the sequence that has occurred in Bosnia recently. The 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at once issued a statement 
demanding a swift and objective investigation and also 
punishment for the guilty persons. 
  "In any case, there must be talk of a political solution to 
the problem of this city and of Bosnia as a whole. We believe 
that such a solution can be found. Otherwise an armed conflict 
could arise between the Serbs and the international peacemaking 
forces. The Serbs have expressed readiness in principle to hand 
Sarajevo over to UN control. It is necessary and possible to 
urgently define the terms of such a handover. Preemptive 
strikes against the positions of any one of the sides will only 
exacerbate the situation."

  [Text] St. Petersburg February 8 TASS -- Speakers of the 
two chambers of the Russian parliament -- Vladimir Shumeyko and 
Ivan Rybkin -- have arrived here today to attend a session of 
the Council of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly. 
  Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS at the airport here that even in 
dealing with international matters some statesmen had the habit 
of "looking what the neighbour will do" and waiting for somebody 
to make the first step. "This is why," the speaker of the 
Council of the Federation (the upper chamber of the Russian 
parliament) believes, "the economic union treaty, signed on 
September 24, 1993, has still not been ratified by CIS 
parliaments." 
  Shumeyko believes that the main task confronting the current 
session of the Interparliamentary Assembly is to create a 
mechanism to settle problems linked with the ratification of 
inter-state treaties. Shumeyko thinks the leaders of the 
delegations, attending the current session, are able to reach an 
agreement on the simutlaneous ratification of the economic union 
treaty by all the CIS parliaments.

  [Text] St. Petersburg February 8 TASS -- Vladimir Shumeyko, 
elected chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly (IPA) of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States by secret ballot here today, 
told ITAR-TASS that the assembly has a great role to play in 
strengthening the Commonwealth. "No matter what economic and 
other agreements may be signed by the executive, they are 
difficult to translate into life without a legislative basis 
which provides a firm foundation," Shumeyko said in an exclusive 
interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  "This foundation can be created only by the parliaments of 
the Commonwealth member states. If we learn to consider 
coordination of legislation of all CIS states at IPA sessions, 
we shall be able to remove unnecessary barriers hampering the 
development of market economies and combine the national 
economies of the Commonwealth member states quite soon. I mean 
legislation concerning taxes, export/import duties and the 
customs union," Vladimir Shumeyko said and added that much work 
was lying ahead. 
  As concerns IPA's political significance, it is also great, 
according to the assembly chairman. Interparliamentary 
assemblies have long existed in Europe and Asia, he said. Now 
an Interparliamentary Assembly has also appeared on the 
territory of the former Soviet Union. "It must have a 
significant weight in the world because is has brought together 
countries which have embarked on the path of democratic 
reforms," Shumeyko said. He stressed the need of establishing 
contacts with other, older interparliamentary assemblies.

  [Text] St. Petersburg February 8 TASS -- A meeting of the 
Commonwealth Inter-Parliamentary Assembly's Council ended here 
today after electing Head of the Russian Upper Chamber Vladimir 
Shumeyko its chairman. 
  The meeting welcomed delegations of Azeri and Georgian 
parliaments who have become members of the Commonwealth 
Inter-Parliamentary Assembly. 
  The meeting focused on bringing national legislation in 
correspondence with the treaty on economic union and other 
commonwealth agreements and approved an initiative on Karabakh 
settlement put forward by the commonwealth interparliamentary 
group headed by Kyrgyz Parliament Chairman Meditkhan 
Sherimkulov. A regular meeting of the assembly's working group 
on the issue is scheduled for next spring in Bishkek. 
  "The council stated deepened relations between the 
Commonwealth Interparliamentary Assembly and interparliamentary 
organizations of the world. A decision of the 
Interparliamentary Union to give the assembly the status of 
permanent observer at the Interparliamentary Union was given 
special attention. The assembly's council is fruitfully 
cooperating with the Nordic Council, the Finnish Parliament, the 
International Red Cross Committee and the Aland Peace Institute 
in joint peace-making operations," says the meeting communique. 
  The meeting also decided to announce a contest for best 
designs of the assembly flag and emblem. 
  The fourth plenary meeting is scheduled for March 17-18,

  [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the 
election of Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation 
Council -- the upper house of Russia's Federal Assembly 
(parliament) -- as the chairman of the Council of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly. 
  The newspaper points out that under present conditions the 
CIS Interparliamentary Assembly "will hardly play the political 
role which was assigned to it by former speaker of the Russian 
parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
  In the opinion of the newspaper, "The CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly is most likely to transform from a high-aiming agency 
into yet another CIS show helping the new and old speakers to 
stay aware of their political significance". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA frontpages an article headlined "A 
Disintegration Process in Russia's Nuclear Power Industry Is 
Under Way". 
  According to the newspaper, the fuel reserves at such major 
Russian nuclear power stations as the Smolensk and Leningrad 
ones will suffice for 11 and 14 days respectively. If nothing 
changes, electric power will be supplied to central Russia only 
for several hours a day, the newspaper cautions. 
  "Last year, Russia's nuclear power stations, according to 
international organisations, operated more reliably than those 
of the United States and France," the writer of the article 
pointed out. 
  "It was necessary, it would seem. To support our nuclear 
power industry. Instead, it has been subjected to large-scale 
experiments", with the necessary funds not being assigned, the 
author of the article writes, recalling that nuclear power 
stations supply electricity to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and 
practically the entire south-western region of Russia. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan who dwelt on economic 
problems and migration processes. 
  Nazarbayev remarked that he is worried at the outflow of 
ethnic Germans from the republic. "I understand the feelings of 
people who seek to return to their historical homeland, the more 
so as most of them had arrived in Kazakhstan not of their own 
will. But during talks with the leaders of Germany I always 
raise matters aimed at expanding the presence of German business 
in Kazakhstan", Nazarbayev said. 
  Speaking about relations with Russia, Nazarbayev said the 
two 
countries are equally interested in meeting their commitments. 
Treaties on military cooperation and joint space projects are 
now in the works, he added. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages an article about the course 
of 
investigation of the case involving participants in the October 
events of last year in Moscow. The investigation concerning 
former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, just as all the other 
arrested after the September-October crisis, is proceeding 
agonisingly slowly, the writer of the article maintains. 
  "Virtually, the charge against Rutskoy is based on his only 
phrase urging people to seize the Moscow mayor's office and the 
Ostankino Television centre," the author of the article points 
out. The journalist believes that the proceedings are being 
dragged out while the election campaign promises by many a 
member of the State Duma about their intention to set up special 
parliamentary commissions to inquire into the case proved 
unfulfilled. 
  "One can suppose that the 'Octobrists' case' will hardly be 
examined by a law-court this year. Upon playing its election- 
campaign role, the case is most likely to surface again only 
when the time will come for yet another election campaign," the 
journalist concludes. 
  TRUD reports that last year Russian customs houses prevented 
the smuggling of valuables, worth about 110,000 million roubles, 
out of the country. "The customs services confiscated 4,000 art 
object and antiques, and more than 50,000 firearms," the 
newspaper said. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR), commenting on Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev's tour of units of the Privolzhskiy 
military district, points out that such trips are prompted by 
the fact that "it is urgently necessary to check on the spot the 
possibility of implementing the new ideas inherent in the 
military doctrine". 
  PRAVDA announces that President Boris Yeltsin will soon 
deliver a report to the Federal Assembly on the country's 
national security strategy. 
  In this connection the newspaper runs one of the alternative 
projects drawn up by a group of independent experts. The 
project was prepared with an eye to a national doctrine in this 
respect. 
  The drafters of the project believe that "preventing a civil 
war, strengthening state institutions, precluding a break-up of 
Russia, and overcoming the socio-economic crisis are the most 
acute problems facing the state in 1994".

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "New Nuclear Missile Program: In </F>
10 Years Russia Will Be Defended by Topols"; first paragraph is 
editorial introduction] 
  [Text] An arms development program has been drawn up for 
Russia's strategic nuclear forces through the year 2005. In an 
exclusive interview Lev Volkov, full member of the International 
and Russian Engineering Academies and corresponding member of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences, who was involved in drawing up 
the program, told IZVESTIYA's military correspondent about its 
contents. 
  Under the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive 
Arms, Volkov said, the Strategic Missile Forces, which perform 
the role of chief deterrent force, may comprise 1,300 launchers 
with single-warhead ICBM's by the set deadline. But the 
country's actual economic potential will allow us to possess 
just 900 launchers. Which missile is to be chosen for this? 
  A number of Russian scientific collectives, independent ones 
included, have researched possible scenarios for strategic 
nuclear forces operations, modeled their dynamics, and come to 
the conclusion that the prospective Strategic Missile Forces 
grouping must comprise a standardized solid-fuel missile like 
the modernized SS-25 ICBM with two basing options: stationary, 
in launch silos; and mobile, on self-propelled launchers with a 
wheeled chassis. 
  IZVESTIYA information: The SS-25 ICBM (in Russia it is 
called the Topol RS-12M) is considered one of the most 
successful off-road mobile missile systems. The missile is made 
in Votkinsk. It weighs 45 tonnes and its throw-weight is 
equivalent to one tonne. It has been on alert duty in the 
Strategic Missile Forces since 1985. The general designer is 
Boris Lagutin. 
  Why has the SS-25 been chosen from among the six existing 
types of missiles? In Lev Volkov's opinion, there are several 
reasons for this. First, it uses solid fuel, which is safe in 
operation, and this in itself provides a substantial gain. 
Second, it is very economical. Given our infrastructure of 
existing and possible position areas, the road network in them, 
special geological features, the cost of capital construction, 
and the availability of housing for officers and their families, 
such a missile will be most affordable. 
  At the same time the optimum ratio of stationary and mobile 
missile systems has also been established: 60-70 to 40-30. 
  Specialists proceeded from an assessment of their combat 
efficiency and cost. It transpired that the average expenditure 
per warhead whose delivery to target can be guaranteed is for 
mobile-based single-warhead missiles practically coincident with 
the expenditure for stationary launchers with the now accepted 
degree of protection. If the silos' degree of protection is 
increased, their cost could end up almost twice that of mobile 
systems. 
  Incidentally, Lev Volkov said, it is known that there have 
been eight disasters involving the operation of nuclear-powered 
submarines with nuclear missiles on board in the naval strategic 
nuclear forces of our country and the United States. Nuclear 
munitions have been lost and people have died. There have been 
similar occurrences with aircraft, but God has spared the 
Strategic Missile Forces. According to specialists' 
calculations, the probability of an incident involving a mobile 
launcher is estimated at one in 100,000 in the course of a year; 
that is, if 500 SPU's [self-propelled launchers] are operated 
for 10 years, there could be a 5-percent probability of an 
incident involving one of them. 
  In industry such a probability is considered safe. 
  I asked Lev Ivanovich why the Americans abandoned the 
Midgetman land-based mobile system if they are so efficient and 
safe to operate. The reason is simple: By the year 2005 the 
United States will have 18 nuclear-powered submarines with 
powerful and highly accurate Trident-2 missiles (1,728 warheads 
in all) capable of hitting both pinpoint and area targets. This 
is more than enough for a deterrent. They have no need to spend 
money on new development. 
  We will not do this either.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is closely following 
the situation in Bosnia in the wake of the recent tragedy in 
Sarajevo, one of his aides said. 
  Dmitry Ryurikov, the president's international affairs aide, 
in an interview with Interfax reaffirmed that Yeltsin would 
shortly discuss the Bosnian crisis with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and other world leaders. 
  "We still believe there are chances to settle it by 
non-violent means," Ryurikov said, citing the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's recent proposals for the demilitarization of 
Sarajevo. "It's along those lines that discussions should 
proceed," he said. 
  He expressed the hope that the incident in the Bosnian 
capital would bring it home to all parties to the conflict that 
"they should end their confrontation, which will be of no 
benefit to anybody, neither to the Serbs nor to the Croats nor 
to the Muslims, and which may provoke a negative reaction on the 
part of the world community." 
  Ryurikov was skeptical about the idea of making one of the 
parties a potential target for an air strike.

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] Recently there has been no let-up in newspaper, 
television, or radio coverage of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnian 
conflict. We could not fail to respond to this topic, 
especially since there are Russian servicemen in the former 
Yugoslavia, and if, after all, the decision is made that the 
Bosnian conflict will be tackled by military means, by means of 
bombardments, then it will be very difficult to predict both 
what Russia's position will be in the end and what in the end 
the position of our soldiers in former Yugoslavia. Today we 
present for your attention a commentary by our journalist 
Aleksandr Znamenskiy, who will tell you about the stance on this 
matter of the Foreign Ministry, specifically of Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and of Russia's Defense Ministry, of Russian Military 
Department Head Army General Pavel Grachev. Aleksandr 
Znamenskiy is at the microphone: 
  [Znamenskiy] Bombing the positions of the warring sides in 
Bosnia is the least effective decision which could be made to 
wind up the crisis in the region, Andrey Kozyrev noted. He 
stressed that the UN resolutions theoretically provide for the 
possibility of military support of UN forces if they are 
subjected to direct attack. In this case the UN secretary 
general is to hold consultations with the permanent members of 
the Security Council, including Russia. Then we willl make a 
decision, the minister said. In particular, he said that in 
Russia such a decision will be taken by the president. 
  Kozyrev said that in the specific situation in Bosnia, it 
should not be a matter of launching strikes against the Serbs 
alone. One should be speaking of providing protection against 
attack from any side. As far as any other strikes are concerned 
which go outside the context of protecting UN forces, say, as 
punishment, we are categorically against strikes, even 
theoretically, Andrey Kozyrev stated. In this connection the 
minister expressed regret that the Russian initiative to convene 
the Security Council has not received proper support among the 
Western partners. In particular, this initiative provided for 
strengthening security zones, including round Sarajevo. It is 
possible that if it had been implemented earlier it would have 
been possible to avoid the tragedy. 
  The time has come for our Western partners in the Security 
Council to take a closer look at our proposals, Kozyrev 
stressed. The Russian minister said that it is necessary to take 
urgent measures, but not to fall into a trap. A provocation is 
possible from any side, the Russian minister stated. Once 
before, in 1914, a provocation was perpetrated in Sarajevo, when 
just such a territorial act caused a global tragedy. It is 
Andrey Kozyrev's view that now, too, an escalation of violence 
could lead to a repetition of this tragic scenario. The 
minister expressed the hope that the international community 
will be guided in this matter by cool political thinking and not 
by emotions. This was the point of view of the head of Russia's 
political department. 
  Regarding the Russian military, they virtually fully support 
it. However, taking into account the importance of the topic, we 
nevertheless asked Russia's Defense Minister Army General Pavel 
Grachev to say a few words in connection with this problem: 
  [Begin Grachev recording] The basic aim of the Russian 
leadership is that a unilateral approach toward determining the 
responsibility of the Bosnian communities for the continuation 
of the armed conflict is impermissible. In the interests of 
putting an end to it as soon as possible, Russia is trying to 
get and will try to ensure that sufficient influence is brought 
to bear not only on the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs but also 
on the leaders of the Croat and Muslim communities. 
  Now, as to the possibility of using military force: We 
believe that the use of the NATO countries' combat aviation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is capable of provoking a new escalation of 
combat actions and is permissible only in the event of a direct 
attack by Bosnian armed formations on the peacekeeping forces. 
Taking into account the complexity of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the dispatch of additional contingents from 
NATO countries into the conflict zone prior to the cessation of 
the combat operations could be used by the command of the Muslim 
community for building up their combat effort, which will 
inevitably provoke a further escalation of the Bosnian armed 
conflict. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Yuliy 
Vorontsov, has proposed putting Sarajevo, the capital of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, under control of a UN administration, 
instead of hitting air strikes at positions of the Bosnian Serbs 
around it. After a closed-door meeting of the Security Council, 
Yuliy Vorontsov said that under the Security Council's 
resolution, air strikes are possible only as a means of 
protecting the UN peacekeeping forces, but not as a means of 
punishing one of the warring Bosnian sides. [passage omitted]

  [Text] New York February 9 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin called on the president of Serbia to 
promote an urgent lifting of the blockade of Sarajevo. 
  In a CNN interview, Churkin said he had a serious talk with 
Slobodan Milosevic, telling him that "we cannot put up with such 
a situation. The Sarajevo blockade should be lifted. And this 
must be done now". 
  At the same time CNN pointed out that the Russian deputy 
foreign minister said air strikes on Serbian troop positions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina might "cast a shadow on Russia's relations 
with western countries."

  [Text] The responsibility for the tragedy in Sarajevo 
cannot be laid on the Serbs, since "no one has proved that they 
are to blame for it yet," the Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman, Mikhail Demurin, said at Tuesday's [8 February] 
briefing in Moscow. 
  According to him, in the present circumstances to launch air 
strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be "the 
least appropriate solution." 
  With reference to the recent letter addressed by the UN 
Secretary General to NATO, Demurin said that it concerned 
primarily actions that lie beyond resolutions issued by the UN 
Security Council. "NATO's readiness to launch air strikes is one 
thing, and the taking of a political decision is another. This 
is a prerogative of the UN Secretary General in consultations 
with the Security Council, where Russia will necessarily have 
its say," he pointed out.

[PFP] the foreign ministry's spokesman, Mikhail Demurin, said at

  In answer to a question from Interfax's correspondent he 
emphasized that Russia's attitude to the "Partnership for Peace" 
idea is positive. As for the organizational side of this 
program, the NATO Council has approved a document on procedures 
connected with the "Partnership for Peace" program, and 
forwarded it to the embassies of countries involved in the 
North-Atlantic Council for Cooperation (NACC), and to Europe's 
neutral states, the diplomat said. 
  According to Demurin, those who drafted the document took 
into account the wishes of Russia, which called for developing 
partnership on the basis of the NACC, and for enabling neutral 
countries to join it as equitable members.

  [Text] Russia has not changed its position on troop 
withdrawal from Estonia, Mikhail Demurin, a spokesman for the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing in Moscow Tuesday 
[8 February]. 
  The ministry was surprised, he said, that the Estonian 
diplomats view the fact that the Russians have yet to submit a 
withdrawal timetable as linkage of the military issues with 
others such as social guarantees for Russian military pensioners 
who stay in Estonia. 
  Demurin recalled that from the outset of the talks the 
Russian negotiators insisted on a civilized solution for the 
11,000 pensioners and their families (a total of 44,000 people - 
IF). In his words, what the Estonian authorities want boils 
down to removal from Estonia of a large number of military 
pensioners, most of whom are old people who have lived there for 
a long time. 
  "We reconfirm our resolve to withdraw Russian troops from 
Estonia in compliance with bilateral agreements which would 
provide a just solution to various problems, in particular the 
future of military pensioners," the Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman emphasized. 
  The 2500 Russian troops now stationed in Estonia are 
expected 
to be withdrawn before August 31, 1994.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1849 GMT on 8 February carries a 
program entitled "Behind the Letter of the Law," which is 
designed to provide a forum for Sergey Filatov, head of Boris 
Yeltsin's administration, to explain the Russian president's 
decrees. 
  In the program, Filatov denies media reports that Georgians 
are not satisfied with the results of the Russian president's 
recent visit to their country, adding that more than 90 percent 
of Georgians welcome the new relations between Georgia and 
Russia. Filatov said that 300,000 Russians lived in Georgia and 
150,000 have already fled the country; the Russian army and the 
Russian border guards there are not defended by any legal 
regulations. 
  Filatov goes on to say that Duma criticism of this visit was 
not "ethical," because President Yeltsin did say that the 
documents of the visit would not be ratified until political 
settlement is reached with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
  Referring to the issue of assistance in the establishment of 
the Georgian army, which Filatov describes as a sensitive issue 
where Abkhazia is concerned, Sergey Filatov says that "since 
Russia agreed with Georgia that we will have, as it were, a 
common border protection, both for Georgia and Russia and on the 
territory of Georgia, then it follows that we should jointly 
take care of the Russian and Georgian security interests alike 
and that is why there is an accord to set up three military 
bases on the territory of Georgia; it is precisely for this 
purpose and not for the purpose of occupation, as many say, but 
for the purpose, as it were, of preserving that state's 
security, and this includes the preservation of the security of 
the Russian state as well." 
  Filatov then reads out Article Three of the Russian-Georgian 
treaty: "The sides will take measures to implement effectively 
the agreement concerning the temporary stay of the Russian 
Federation military formations on the territory of the Republic 
of Georgia and they will also conclude -- and here I stress that 
it does not say they have concluded already, but just that they 
will conclude -- an agreement to render assistance in the 
establishment of the armed forces of the Republic of Georgia." 
Filatov says that the Russian press regards this as already 
done, alleging that such an agreement had already been signed. 
Not so, says Filatov, adding that this agreement also depends 
on the resolution of the South Ossetian and Abkhazian problems. 
  Asked by an unidentified interviewer about the economic 
aspects of Yeltsin's visit to Georgia, Filatov quotes Yeltsin as 
having said that "we would not take any steps which would be 
detrimental to Russia," and notes that he has nothing to add to 
that. 
  Asked why former finance minister Fedorov and former first 
deputy prime minister Gaydar were not included by Yeltsin in his 
decree on the composition of the Security Council, Filatov says 
that this consultative body was appointed by the president, and 
stresses the consultative nature of the council. By law, people 
would join the council by virtue of the posts they held and 
neither man could any longer be held to qualify. 
  In conclusion, Filatov says that he looks forward to the 
coming signing of the treaty on demarcation of federal powers 
with the Republic of Tatarstan, as part and parcel of the 
ongoing decentralization process.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] The Prime Ministers of Russia and Moldova signed a 
trade and economic cooperation agreement for 1994 in Moscow on 
Monday [7 February]. According to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's 
assessment, the accord rests on the universally accepted 
principles of civilized interaction and world prices. 
  As experts have explained to an Interfax reporter, the 
document only sets guidelines, as for the concrete volumes of 
supplies and the prices of commodities, they will figure in a 
supplement being drafted as part of the accord. 
  Chernomyrdin told journalists that the balance of trade with 
Moldova is "shaping up fine," with the republic paying up for 
all imports but fuel from Russia. He emphasized that if in 1993 
the prices of fuel supplied to CIS countries had been fixed 
differentially, as of January of this year Russia has been 
selling fuel and other commodities to its Commonwealth partners 
at world prices. 
  Meanwhile, Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli has 
remarked in an interview with Interfax that the agreement offers 
solutions to the existing problems. In his words, Chisinau did 
not even request a rescheduling of its debt for a later date. 
(Interfax Note: By the end of January, Moldova incurred a 50 
Bn ruble debt to the state-run "Gazprom" concern of Russia for 
gas shipments) 
  "Naturally, we will pay off the debts on the prices fixed in 
1993," Sangheli noted and promised on his cabinet's behalf to 
square accounts next month. He reported that the mechanism of 
debt repayment had been devised along with "Gazprom," however, 
he declined to give any details on this system of mutual 
accounts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin by </F>
Vyacheslav Yelagin; place and date not given: "National 
Interests in the Baltic Cannot Be Resolved Using the Language of 
Ultimatums. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin 
Answers ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's Questions"] 
  [Text] [Yelagin] Vitaliy Ivanovich, what do you see as 
the main cause of the difficulties in Russia's relations with 
the Baltic countries? 
  [Churkin] We believe that some Baltic politicians are making 
a serious mistake. Namely in thinking that the Baltic states' 
national interests can be realized through confrontation with 
Russia. Hence the endless appeals to the world community aimed 
at eliciting a sense of pity and compassion for small countries 
which are supposedly being hurt by their bigger neighbors. It 
is evidently purely domestic considerations and an attempt to 
obtain something for themselves that are behind this. However, 
the renaissance of the Baltic peoples is only possible if they 
build partnership relations with the Russian Federation. I hope 
that a sensible approach will ultimately prevail. Positive 
momentum can already be glimpsed in our relations with Lithuania. 
  [Yelagin] But how are the "sore points" in Russia's 
relations with the Baltic states being resolved? How justified 
are our northern neighbors' incessant accusations directed at us? 
  [Churkin] There are two problems. First, the troop 
withdrawal. Plenty has been done in this sphere. Today there 
are still around 13,000 Russian servicemen in Latvia and fewer 
than 4,000 in Estonia. In other words, the withdrawal has been 
85 percent carried out. Our partners are for some reason losing 
sight of this. I would remind you that the redeployment of the 
Russian troop contingent began at these states' request without 
corresponding agreements being signed. We relied on their good 
will. Regrettably, that did not materialize. They have not had 
a good word to say for Russia, even though it is continuing the 
troop withdrawal amid a very grave economic situation. What is 
more, Estonia and Latvia occasionally make tougher demands. 
However, we are persisting with the policy of negotiations. It 
is important for these to culminate in the signing of 
appropriate agreements. The drafts have been almost 90 percent 
coordinated, among them a document laying down terms for 
retaining the Russian strategic installation at Skrunda. 
  The second problem is the position of the Russian and 
Russian-speaking population. This painful issue is the subject 
of our careful attention. During the interstate talks Tallinn 
and Riga are doggedly avoiding discussing the key subject of 
citizenship. And this procrastination is creating conditions 
for the nonindigenous population to be ousted. Despite the 
efforts of international rights organizations and 
recommendations from CSCE and Council of Europe experts, the 
Baltic countries' legislation still enshrines rules that 
discriminate against ethnic Russians. In Estonia, for instance, 
there are six laws of this kind pertaining to citizenship, 
language, and schools which are in one way or another injurious 
to the Russian-speaking population. And Latvia's Saeima 
recently adopted a law on the election of local self-government 
bodies robbing over 35 percent of the country's foreign 
inhabitants of their right to vote even at municipal level. 
That is tantamount to barring them from political life. We 
therefore reserve the right to raise this topic over and over in 
our bilateral contacts with Riga and Tallinn and also with 
international bodies. Naturally, strong-arm means of resolving 
the problem are precluded. The rule of law is the only option. 
  Lately Riga and Tallinn have been constantly reproaching 
us, saying that Russia links this issue with the troop 
withdrawal. We have not done that and have no intention of 
doing so, but we note Baltic politicians' promises that the 
position of the nonindigenous population will improve once the 
Russian troops are withdrawn, and will remind them of this at 
the right time. 
  [Yelagin] Could you comment on the Estonian side's 
territorial claims on a number of rayons in Pskov Oblast? 
  [Churkin] We know that Estonian representatives with 
semiofficial status are active in Pskov Oblast. They are 
insistently canvassing the local population to take up 
citizenship of the Estonian Republic and promising them some 
land or compensation for land. At the same time they do not 
forget to emphasize that these territories will shortly belong 
to Estonia. I do not think there is any need to explain the 
seriousness of these actions. Via diplomatic channels we have 
drawn Tallinn's attention to their inadmissibility. We must not 
be forced to take retaliatory steps and create additional 
irritants in Russian-Estonian relations. The question is 
simple: The territories belong to Russia. 
  [Yelagin] It is no secret that people in the Baltic display 
a pathological reaction to Russian politicians' use of the term 
"nearby foreign countries," considering it illegitimate with 
regard to these countries. What is your opinion? 
  [Churkin] Perhaps this term should not be used in official 
statements. But should anyone get aggrieved if it crops up 
occasionally? I think not. We are not after all equating our 
relations with the CIS states and the Baltic countries. There 
are definite differences here. The latter left the USSR 
earlier. They were not among the 12 states formed after the 
breakup of the former Union. They have no intention of becoming 
members of the CIS. Consequently we have a particular 
relationship with them. But because we lived in the same state 
for many years, we still have common problems. The use of this 
term does not imply an encroachment on any sovereignty, and that 
includes the Baltic. 
  [Yelagin] Your refusal to accept Russia's assumption of 
responsibility for the "Soviet occupation" of the Baltic caused 
a fairly stormy reaction in circles there. What is your opinion 
of those events from the viewpoint of international law? 
  [Churkin] They require evaluation from many angles. The 
Soviet troops were brought in and stayed in accordance with 
treaties with these states. The assent of these countries' top 
leaders to the troops' being brought in was also obtained in 
1940, albeit at the last minute. Thus, from the viewpoint of 
the international law both of that time and of the present, 
there are no grounds for talking about the USSR's armed 
incursion into the territory of the Baltic states and their 
subsequent occupation since, in addition, authority functions 
were exercised by national administrators. 
  It is appropriate to recall that the USSR Supreme Soviet's 
1940 decisions admitting Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia to the 
Soviet Union were preceded by corresponding political appeals 
from their supreme representative bodies. So we cannot talk 
about these countries' becoming part of the USSR as a result of 
the latter's unilateral actions. With this and the above 
arguments in mind, the entry of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia 
into the former Soviet federation cannot be described as 
annexation. 
  What is more, a concrete legal definition of any action can 
only be provided in the light of the law in force at the time 
when the said actions were committed. In this connection the 
claims regarding the illegality of the USSR's threatening force 
against the Baltic countries in 1939-1940 are, at the very 
least, contentious. Unlike present-day law, where the principle 
of nonuse of force and threat of force is fundamental, the 
international law in force prior to the adoption of the UN 
Charter contained no provision banning the threat of force. 
  Needless to say, a formal legal approach which is correct in 
terms of the past does not accord in every respect with current 
moral and political or in some respects even legal assessments 
of events. Renewed Russia condemns the actions of the Stalinist 
regime. Russians suffered no less than the other peoples of the 
former USSR as a result. We cannot and did not agree with 
attempts to put present-day Russia in the dock by analyzing 
particular events in the past. 
  There have been many dark pages in history, but it is our 
common history and the problems inherited from it can only be 
resolved together, in a spirit of cooperation and mutual 
respect. We urge our immediate neighbors to do this.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] The head of Russian diplomacy is not interested in 
what the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, says about Russia's foreign policy. Kozyrev has 
no intention of commenting on Zhirinovskiy's numerous 
statements. He urges public opinion "not to focus" attention on 
them. The foreign minister said so in a conversation with a 
group of journalists on the eve of his visit to Tashkent and 
Almaty. 
  As Kozyrev said, such attention "feeds the embryos of a 
furer 
[as received]" the LDP leader actually is. "If we begin to 
listen to what Zhirinovskiy says, and comment on his escapades, 
we'll have no time for anything else. As a result we'll find 
ourselves in a fantastic, not to say stupid, world," said 
Kozyrev. 
  According to him, Zhirinovskiy, with his discourse on the 
tasks of Russia's foreign policy, is reminiscent of a clown who 
"distorts reality." "In fact, this is what he is doing," 
Kozyrev pointed out. 
  Long before the emergence of Zhirinovskiy he, as Russia's 
foreign minister, raised the issue of "ethnic cleansings" taking 
place in some Baltic countries, particularly in Latvia and 
Estonia, he stressed. "About one-third of the population is 
mistreated on the basis of ethnicity. This relates to the 
Russian speakers -- ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, 
Jews and even Finns, who are denied the right to citizenship," 
the minister said. "They wish to receive such citizenship, but 
it is denied to them for only one reason, their ethnicity. If 
this is not ethnic cleansing, what is it?" 
  According to him, in some cases, in Bosnia-Herzegovina for 
instance, ethnic cleansing is expressed in the form of "criminal 
violence," and in other cases in the form of denying large 
groups of the population their civil rights, particularly the 
right to citizenship. "If -- wherever this takes place -- people 
are called "invaders" and "aliens," they begin to behave 
accordingly. A result of this is instability," Russia's foreign 
minister said. 
  He referred to one more example of how the rights of 
Russian- 
speakers are infringed upon. "In the former USSR everyone was 
obliged to undergo military service. Estonians and Latvians 
were no exception -- they served in the Soviet Army. Now they 
want to evict from Estonia and Latvia not all the former Soviet 
servicemen, but only Russian-speakers. Obviously what underlies 
the demands for eviction is the ethnic, not political, 
principle," Kozyrev said. 
  According to him, "the attempts to take revenge on ordinary 
people for the crimes committed by the Stalinist regime reflect 
political foolishness." "I recognize that the Stalinist regime 
committed crimes, but one must not forget that they were 
committed by political powers -- Stalin and Hitler -- who 
concluded the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. To avenge these 
political crimes 45 years later on thousands of ordinary people, 
and use the ethnic principle when doing so, is inadmissible." 
  Russia, in the vicinity of whose borders such things are 
happening, cannot remain indifferent to them, Kozyrev stressed. 
"The world must pay attention to this inhumane and potentially 
dangerous situation," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of </F>
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, by unidentified Czech 
television reporter in Moscow on 8 February, including recording 
of comments by Zhirinovskiy, in Russian with superimposed Czech 
translation] 
  [Text] [Reporter] This is the headquarters of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
confirmed to us today that he has indeed been invited to visit 
the Czech Republic by the Republican Party of the Czech 
Republic. According to Zhirinovskiy, so far they have received 
only a fax of the Republicans' invitation, and the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia is waiting for the original of the 
invitation to arrive. Answering a question about what he thinks 
about negative reactions to the possibility that he would visit 
the Czech Republic, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] If Vaclav Havel feels unhappy about my visit, 
then I am also unhappy about the fact that playwrights can 
become presidents of some countries. This is not right. I am 
not going to write stage plays, I am not going to write the 
Cherry Orchard if I am not Chekhov. Why, then, is a playwright 
a president? Your country is dying. I can assure you that in 
10 years there will be no Moravia, no Sudeten. In 10 years the 
entire Czech nation will curse Havel as the Russian people are 
cursing Gorbachev. All, including me, used to applaude him -- 
after Chernenko we saw Gorbachev as a good option. Nowadays we 
curse that villain. 
  The same situation will exist in your country. Vaclav Havel 
will die and in 10 years young Czechs will curse him. They will 
be forced to speak German, they will be forced to forget their 
mother tongue, they will be forced to attend Holy Mass in German 
churches and to clean the boots of German officers. This will 
be the Czechs' fate in a few years. 
  We do not want this. We intend to call a congress of 
Slavonic nations on 2 and 3 April. We are 300 million, we will 
live in our East European community and will not serve Western 
Europe. 
  [Reporter] Answering a question about his views on the 
possibility of an air strike against the troops shelling 
Sarajevo, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We oppose violence. To bomb Serbian towns is 
the same as bombing Russian towns. If this terrible thing takes 
place we will lodge our protest with the countries whose pilots 
get involved in the bombing. The same thing will consequently 
happen to their towns -- bombs will fall on towns of the 
countries which attack Bosnia.

<F P=106> [By V. Lyubovtsev; from the "Utro" program] </F>
  [Text] Upward to the stars. This slogan is apparently 
becoming quite popular in Czech science laboratories. It is 
nice to think that our country contributed in many ways to make 
this slogan a reality for the Czech Republic and its people. 
Details from our correspondent in Prague. 
  [Begin recording] [Lyubovtsev] Bench trials of a future 
satellite are being carried out at the Czech Academy of Sciences 
laboratory. It is hard to imagine just how far it will fly from 
this small laboratory -- more than 200,000 kilometers into an 
orbit around the Earth. In tandem with another satellite -- and 
there will be two such pairs -- it will be part of the new 
international (Interbol) project designed to study the 
magnetosphere of our planet. The complicated internal workings 
of this piece of space apparatus have been prepared in the 
laboratories of 19 European countries. The main initiators of 
the project are Russia and the Czech Republic. Specialists from 
Poland, Germany, and France, together with our scientists are 
carrying out tests on the scientific instruments. It can be 
seen here that heavenly bodies are made by human hands and 
through the cooperation of entire collectives. Pavel Ceska, 
head of the project for the Czech side and chief coordinator of 
the work, is a world famous scientist. 
  [Ceska] This project is called (Interbol) and work on it has 
been going on since the early 1980's when planning and 
development of the project began. Our group from the Geophysics 
Institute was involved in the space research program right from 
the very beginning of the Interkosmos program, which began in 
1967-68. 
  [Lyubovtsev] In other words, Nathan Andreyevich, you have 
very extensive experience in cooperation. 
  [Eysman] Yes, it goes back to the 1960's. Our Czech 
colleagues have installed quite a number of instruments in 
practically all of the international cooperation programs in 
which the Geophysics Institute took part. Naturally enough, 
however, our Czech colleagues made progress and began to develop 
and launch their own satellites with the aid of our launch 
vehicles. 
  [Ceska] This project includes all the international 
research, and global research into conditions for the 
preservation of life on our planet. [end recording]

  [Text] Members of the Combined Committee for Economic 
Cooperation between Hokkaido and the Russian Far East are now 
meeting at a sea resort area in the suburbs of Sapporo, Japan. 
  Representatives of the local governments of the Coastal 
Region, Khavarovsk, and Sakhalin, and the central government's 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Fisheries Committee, and 
the Chamber of Commerce are attending the meeting from Russia. 
  This Combined Committee was activated in 1992 to discuss 
promotion of economic relations between Hokkaido and neighboring 
Russia's territories at the proposal of the Hokkaido governor. 
  The working-level meeting held in the suburbs of Sapporo is 
a 
continuation of positive Russian-Japanese exchanges begun at 
various levels last week. In following with this current of the 
times, there are now formal and informal talks being held in 
Tokyo between the representatives of the foreign ministries, 
defense ministries, and border security-related offices of the 
two countries.

<F P=106> [Maksim Shiryamov report under the "Behind the Scenes" </F>
rubric: "A Quiet Coup in State Duma"] 
  [Text] The latest meeting of the Russian parliament's lower 
chamber has seen a palace mini-coup of sorts, as a result of 
which actual levers of power in the State Duma will soon be 
concentrated in the hands of one man. 
  This was said to your correspondent by Georgiy Zadonskiy, a 
prominent parliamentary figure. Exploiting the inexperience of 
a vast majority of the deputies, he explained, a document was 
imposed on them without discussion that turns the modest State 
Duma speaker into its president. 
  He meant the decree "On Providing Support for the State 
Duma's Activity," which gives Chairman Ivan Rybkin powers to 
form the chamber's staff. The chief of staff, who, among other 
things, takes care of the parliamentarians' social and consumer 
needs, was subordinated directly to the parliamentary speaker, 
and comrade Ivan Rybkin, whose powers have until recently been 
limited to a humble steering of meetings, suddenly got powerful 
leverage for purposefully manipulating the deputy corps from 
behind the scenes. 
  However decent a figure the current parliamentary chief may 
have been cutting so far, it is still fresh in everyone's mind 
how extremely modest Ruslan Imranovich [Khasbulatov] was "at the 
beginning of glorious endeavors." [title of a novel about Peter 
the Great] But the temptation "to go down in history" turned 
out to be too irresistible. This is why the democrats, who 
initially just stood gaping, are intent on ringing a bell in 
that regard at the nearest State Duma plenary meeting.

  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
proposed to the Foreign Ministry to replace certain ambassadors, 
according to Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the parliamentary 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  Lukin did not provide any names, but told TASS on Tuesday 
that his committee had "submitted to the Foreign Ministry 
proposals regarding appointments and recall of diplomatic 
representatives abroad -- ambassadors, consuls and 
representatives in international organisations". 
  According to the constitution, it is the Russian president 
who appoints and dismisses ambassadors after consultations with 
corresponding parliamentary commissions and committees. 
  Lukin admitted that the proposals of his committee can be 
disregarded by the president. The notion of "consultations" 
does not strictly define whether "the president is obliged to 
agree with recommendations of the chamber and its committee or 
can ignore them", he said and added that his committee would 
continue to work according to the powers vested with it by the 
constitution. 
  On Monday the Russian president accepted the resignation of 
Ivan Silayev, the Russian representative in EC.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 8 Feb -- Members of the Federation 
Council Committee for International Affairs intend to have a 
preliminary familiarization with texts of all the international 
agreements subject to ratification and examination by the 
parliament. There are about 100 of these documents, and the 
committee has made a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry to 
submit them to the Federal Assembly's upper chamber, Vladimir 
Podoprigora, chairman of the committee, told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent. 
  In accordance with the Russian Constitution, the federal 
laws 
on the ratification and denouncement of Russia's international 
agreements are subject to mandatory ratification by the 
Federation Council, he noted. 
  Podoprigora stressed that his committee will closely 
coordinate work with colleagues in the lower chamber, and he has 
already agreed with Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma's relevant 
subdivision and experienced diplomat, to act in harmony to 
ensure fruitful work. In his view, this is very important since 
the process of passing agreements through parliament will now 
become more complicated as they will be discussed at separate 
sittings of the chambers. [passage omitted]

"Sowing Under Threat"] 
  [Text] In connection with the crisis which has developed in 
the agro-industrial complex deputies of the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly Federation Council have adopted an appeal to 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Government Chairman Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. It states, in particular: 
  "...In the space of two years the volume of agricultural 
production in Russia has fallen to 65-70 percent of the average 
annual level during 1986-1990. Seed production and pedigree 
livestock breeding have been destroyed. In terms of the numbers 
of cattle, hogs, and sheep the Russian Federation has been 
`thrust back' to the level of the sixties and seventies." 
  "...Owing to the inadequate growth in the prices of 
industrial and agricultural output, practically all farms have 
ended up insolvent. The implementation of all types of work 
connected with preparing for spring sowing has now been totally 
halted because of the financial crisis." 
  The Federation Council deputies ask the country's leadership 
to "examine without delay an entire package of questions to 
ensure the equivalent exchange of agricultural and industrial 
output and a radical change in tax, credit, and investment 
policy with regard to the agricultural sector." "It is 
extremely necessary for real state assistance to be given to the 
agro-industrial complex in the form of credit and 
material-technical resources before the start of the spring 
field work and with due regard for the seasonal nature of this 
work," the appeal states.

<F P=106> [Oleg Bedula and Aleksandr Bugay report: "Volga Military </F>
District: How Is the New Military Doctrine `Working' Among the 
Troops?"] 
  [Text] The three-day working tour of Volga Military 
District units by Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation 
minister of defense, is the first in a series of planned 
analogous tours of all the other districts and fleets, which he 
intends to make before the start of this summer. 
  The need for such tours has been occasioned by several 
circumstances. There is, above all, the pressing need to verify 
locally the possibility of the practical implementation of the 
military doctrine's new ideas. In addition, the defense 
minister and the generals and officers accompanying him will get 
a good opportunity to familiarize themselves with the 
organization and course of combat training under the present far 
from simple conditions and to gain a clearer idea of the 
prospects for the organizational development of Russia's highly 
mobile Armed Forces. 
  Such tours will also provide an opportunity for personal 
talks with the administration heads of the oblasts, krays, 
cities, and rayons where Army units and combined units are 
stationed -- which will undoubtedly contribute to resolving the 
existing social problems in practice locally. 
  Army General Pavel Grachev cited familiarization with the 
organization and course of combat training and with the 
provision of facilities for the personnel of the tank army 
withdrawn from Germany and the airborne division withdrawn from 
the Transcaucasus as the priority area of his work in the Volga 
Military District. It was no coincidence that right after 
arriving in Samara 7 February the representatives of the 
Ministry of Defense listened to what the district command's had 
to say about these problems. 
  As the defense minister pointed out, on the whole the tasks 
set the district in terms of combat and mobilization readiness, 
operational and combat training, and strengthening military 
discipline are being fulfilled. Today the district's troops are 
capable of fulfilling the tasks facing them. Pavel Grachev 
emphasized, however, that in the very near future it will be 
necessary to improve considerably the quality of the combat 
training of individual units and combined units, a list of 
which, incidentally, has been drawn up separately and which will 
become, as the new military doctrine requires, airmobile and 
capable of being moved great distances very quickly and 
fulfilling the set combat tasks under very complex conditions. 
  In the course of the hearing the question of the urgent need 
to go over to a territorial system of troop control was also 
raised. It is abnormal when the commander of a particular 
military district is not the sole master of, let us assume, the 
units of central subordination stationed on this district's 
territory. As Army General Pavel Grachev pointed out, the 
elimination of this gap is a task for the very near future. 
  When speaking today of enhancing combat readiness, the 
problem of the troops' undermanning cannot be overlooked. This, 
in particular, was discussed at the defense minister's meeting 
with officers of Samara Garrison, which was held in the District 
Officers' House. For the first time in two years the latest 
draft into the Army proceeded in an organized manner. As the 
result of joint efforts by all the structures involved, the 
military commissariats were able to ensure that the Armed Forces 
today are almost 60-percent manned. If you compare this figure 
with the indicators for the fall of 1993, when manning stood at 
just 42.8 percent, it is clear that things are on the mend. 
  As for the Volga Military District, here the plan for the 
draft was fulfilled by 95 percent. This indicator in itself is 
quite high. Something else is of concern. Whereas some 
military commissariats managed to cope excellently with the task 
of the draft (the Bashkir Republic Military Commissariat 
achieved a 100-percent draft, and the Perm and Orenburg Oblast 
Military Commissariats had indicators just a little lower), the 
defense minister called the work of the Tatar Republic Military 
Commissariat and the Samara and Kirov Oblast Military 
Commissariats unsatisfactory. The draft for service under 
contract does not arouse concern. In the Middle Volga Region it 
stood at 125 percent of the planned level. 
  The Army's further reduction was also discussed at the 
meeting with officers. According to a statement by Army General 
Pavel Grachev, by 1 January 1995 the organization and 
establishment and the actual strength of the Armed Forces are to 
be comparable and stand at 2 million men. Colonel General 
Anatoliy Sergeyev, commander of the Volga Military District, 
reported that not one officer or ensign without an apartment 
will be discharged in the district. But if this does happen, 
that person will retain his place in the line to obtain housing 
in the unit where he completed his service. 
  During the meeting the defense minister presented valuable 
gifts to the district's officers who had distinguished 
themselves. Late in the evening of 7 February Army General 
Pavel Grachev had talks with representatives of the Samara 
Oblast Administration.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamyshev report: "Situation in the North Caucasus. </F>
Ingush President Refuses To Seek Second Term"] 
  [Excerpts] Although most decisions made by the Russian 
president and government on overcoming the consequences of the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict have not been implemented, the 
situation in the region has somewhat stabilized in the past few 
months. However, Ingush President Ruslan Aushev's unexpected 
announcement on Monday that he would not seek reelection for a 
second term may cause a new heightening of tensions. [passage 
omitted] 
  The 27 February elections themselves, despite the incumbent 
president's short stay in office, did not come as a surprise: 
As soon as he assumed office, Ruslan Aushev promised to work 
out a new constitution and to hold new presidential and 
parliamentary elections in accordance with it. It always seemed 
obvious, however, that it would be he who would be the main and 
in fact the only actual candidate for a new presidential term. 
This is why Aushev's announcement surprised even many people 
from his inner circle, the Ingush president's press service told 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY. 
  The reason given by the president himself does not appear 
very plausible, though: He and his government could have hardly 
done everything they wanted and were able to within one year. 
In addition, the "emergency rule" Ruslan Aushev referred to 
cannot be dismissed as a thing of the past -- at least the 
problem of refugees has not lost its urgency. Some observers 
attribute Aushev's exit to the election of his main rival, 
Akhsarbek Galazov, as North Ossetian president, implying that by 
doing so the Ingush leader recognized his inability to cooperate 
productively with his Ossetian counterpart. Given that there 
are no more or less prominent and authoritative figures behind 
Ruslan Aushev's back, however, one may state with assurance that 
any of his successors will be much less experienced and may 
bungle by breaking the fragile stability that has currently come 
about in the region. Nor will he enjoy so unanimous a support 
in society as the incumbent president. Still, it is too early 
to talk about Aushev's definitive departure, because his refusal 
to run for office has left only one candidate in the field, for 
which reason the elections may simply not take place at all.

<F P=106> [Sergey Fedotov report: "Mintimer Shaymiyev Address. </F>
President Calls on Citizens To Take Part in Federal Elections"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's sitting of the Tatarstan Supreme 
Soviet's 18th session is likely to remain as the shortest on 
record, lasting 20 minutes in all. Having found no common 
ground on the question of reforming the republic's authorities, 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid Mukhametshin decided to close the 
session. After a 30-minute break he opened another, the 19th 
session. It will be as memorable as the previous one, with 
Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev's publicly calling on 
parliament to hold repeat elections for the Federal Assembly on 
13 March. 
  Discussions in Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet on reforming the 
authorities have been going on since 18 October 1993. Yesterday 
proved that even this time was too short for the two 
parliamentary commissions to come to an agreement on two 
versions of the draft law. 
  The dragged-out discussion on reforming the authorities 
augured a heated atmosphere, something neither the Supreme 
Soviet chairman nor the president wanted at all in connection 
with what Mintimer Shaymiyev was going to say in parliament. 
This is perhaps why the session was urgently terminated. 
  The statement that followed came as a total surprise for 
many 
deputies, especially those who represent Tatar national circles. 
"Proceeding from the course of the negotiations with the Russian 
Federation, I consider necessary the presence of Tatarstan in 
both the State Duma and the Federation Council of Russia. I am 
confident that the republic's population will support me by 
their active part in the 13 March elections," the president 
said. This address obviously came in response to Vice President 
Vasiliy Likhachev's successful negotiations in Moscow. 
Attesting to their positive result is also the fact that Mr. 
Shaymiyev did not arrive in Moscow Saturday although his visit 
had been expected, according to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's lights. 
  In the meantime, many deputies speaking for the local press 
right before that had no doubt that the president sided with 
those who support the line toward Tatarstan's going it alone, 
and urged him to demand that Moscow grant special status not 
only for the republic but also for its representatives in the 
Federal Assembly. Radical nationalists demanded that only 
Tatarstan observers rather than its full members of the senate 
and the Duma be present there. 
  Mr. Shaymiyev also stated, having in mind the interstate 
treaty between Moscow and Kazan: "Being born is a document 
hitherto unknown in practice, which will provide a testimony to 
a renewal of the federation on democratic principles, a 
guarantee of our republic's statehood." The deputies' reaction 
to the president's words remained an enigma for Russian-speaking 
journalists because debates were called off at the 
parliamentarians' request following two speeches in the Tatar 
language. 
  Local observers believe that at least 60 percent of the 
republic's citizens will come to the polls on 13 March with the 
blessing of Mintimer Shaymiyev. In all probability one should 
expect in the coming days an official communication on Tatarstan 
President Mintimer Shaymiyev himself and Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Farid Mukhametshin joining the election campaign for a seat in 
the Federation Council.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "All-Russia Tatar Newspaper </F>
YEDINSTVO" rubric: "Candidates Determined"] 
  [Text] The election race in Tatarstan is proceeding with 
renewed vigor after the first round failed to produce a result. 
The "Equal Rights and Legality" electoral bloc, comprising seven 
democratically oriented parties and movements, is showing the 
greatest initiative. 
  The newspaper IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA reports that the bloc 
determined its list of candidate deputies to the Russian 
Parliament at a routine session. They include political 
scientist Vladimir Belyayev and Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Deputy 
Valentin Mikhaylov. They gained the greatest number of votes in 
December's election. Senior Lecturer at Kazan University 
Aleksandr Shtanin is being nominated from "Russia's Choice," and 
Rayon Soviet worker Yuriy Rostovshchikov from the "Yabloko" bloc. 
  In the meantime, the newspaper comments, the opposition has 
also become active. The "Defense for the Tatarstan President" 
committee has examined the question of "whether it is expedient 
to conduct Russian elections on the territory of the sovereign 
Republic of Tatarstan." It came to the conclusion: "Elections 
to the Russian Parliament should not take place in Tatarstan as 
the republic did not sign the Federation Treaty. What is more, 
it has its own Constitution."

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukashov report from Kazan under the "Republics" </F>
rubric: "Russia, Tatarstan Have Almost Agreed. Historic 
Document May Be Signed 15 February"] 
  [Text] Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev, who 
heads the Tatar delegation to talks with Russia, has told your 
SEGODNYA correspondent that the work on the draft Treaty on the 
Mutual Delegation of Powers and Terms of Reference between the 
Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation has been 
virtually completed. Last weekend the document was presented to 
Presidents Yeltsin and Shaymiyev. 
  Likhachev would not specify what formula for relations 
between the republic and the federal center was found after 
nearly three years of negotiations, saying only that it differed 
from Article 61 of the Tatarstan Constitution, which stipulates 
that "the Republic of Tatarstan is a sovereign state, a subject 
of international law, associated with the Russian 
Federation-Russia on the basis of a treaty..." It has 
transpired, however, that the Russian side agreed to accept 
sovereignty and the republic's status as a subject of 
international law, a fact from which local observers conclude 
that only the term "associated" has been changed in the 
aforementioned constitutional formula. 
  The Tatarstan vice president said also that human rights and 
freedoms come first in the treaty and that the largest section 
deals with the joint powers of the Russian and Tatar 
authorities. In Likhachev's view, this is an argument in the 
dispute about how the treaty should be assessed: As a document 
formalizing Russia's breakup or as a legal framework for 
Russia's establishing itself as a federation. 
  Likhachev said also that "the talks between Tatarstan and 
Russia have ushered in a completely new type of diplomacy" and 
that the "draft treaty under consideration is unprecedented both 
in Russian history and on a world scale." 
  During the Tatar delegation's stay in Moscow another four 
agreements were drawn up that are set to be signed 
simultaneously with the treaty: on combatting crime, on 
finances, on budget relations, and on foreign economic activity. 
Hence 11 out of the planned 12 agreements (seven were signed 
earlier, and one -- on military organization -- has not yet been 
prepared) will go into force in the near future. 
  This week, a Tatar delegation is scheduled to arrive in 
Moscow again to initial the treaty, a ceremony which was put off 
4 February owing to Boris Yeltsin's illness. The ceremony of 
signing the document is still tentatively scheduled for 15 
February. 
  It is yet unclear at what stage the treaty should pass 
through the Federation Council: The upper chamber has made 
clear that is wants to take part in the historic event.

  [Text] Main production facilities and defense enterprises 
at the center of nuclear shipbuilding in Severodvinsk have been 
brought to a stop for a week at least. Fuel reserves at two of 
the town's heating plants are running out. Here, heat and 
electricity are used only for the social sphere, they are 
supplied to houses and enterprises to ensure the port's vital 
services. 
  A critical fuel situation has appeared in Arkhangelsk. The 
temperature in the heating systems has been lowered. 
  Main production lines of the paper and pulp combine in 
Novodvinsk, which is a major combine in the oblast, have been 
stopped. 
  Power engineering workers in the White Sea region do not 
have 
the money to buy fuel. Non-payers -- mainly organizations 
financed from the budget -- owe them over 20 billion rubles. 
This situation in power engineering causes special concern in 
connection with the weather forecast -- which predicts a sharp 
fall in temperature in Murmansk Oblast this week -- down to 
30-40 degrees [centigrade] below zero.

  [Text] Russia hopes that the talks on the nuclear problem 
to begin in Kiev on Tuesday will clarify all issues pertaining 
to nuclear weapons, leader of the Russian delegation Yuriy 
Dubinin told Interfax. 
  He believes that the Ukrainian parliament's resolution on 
the 
ratification of the START-I treaty, passed on February 4, 1994, 
has many "ambiguous places." It does not say, for instance, 
what percentage of nuclear weapons is to be eliminated. 
  Dubinin said that on November 18, 1993, the Ukrainian 
parliament passed the resolution on the ratification of the 
START-I treaty, according to which only 36% of the 
Ukrainian 
missiles and 42% of the warheads were to be eliminated. 
"This 
goes against both the START-I treaty and the Lisbon agreements. 
It's still unclear whether Ukraine intends to eliminate 
100% 
of the nuclear weapons located on its territory in strict 
accordance with the START-I treaty and the Lisbon protocol," he 
said. 
  According to Dubinin, neither is it clear whether Ukraine 
will join the nonproliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. 
  Speaking about Ukraine's participation in NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program, he said that Russia is approaching this issue 
calmly. "Russia has already supported the partnership concept. 
Why should Ukraine not join it?" he said. 
<H3>  ...AND UKRAINE WILL SOON JOIN NONPROLIFERATION TREATY, 
AMBASSADOR SAYS </H3>
  Ukraine will be a non-nuclear state and will "shortly" join 
the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the Ukrainian ambassador to 
Russia said. 
  Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told a news conference in Moscow on 
Monday that the Ukrainian parliament had now approved all the 
points of Article Five of the Lisbon Protocol. "This eliminates 
the main problem, and now everything is ready for joining the 
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the 
immediate future," he said. All nuclear arms will be removed 
from Ukraine, he said. 
  Kryzhanovskiy said the Ukrainian legislature had charged the 
government with the exchanging of the START-I ratification 
instruments and instructed it to take more efforts to enter into 
relevant international agreements. 
  The ambassador did not rule out that Ukraine's membership in 
the Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state would be 
approved by the present parliament, but said this was most 
likely to be done by the next legislature, to be elected on 
March 27. 
  Commenting on Ukraine's relations with Russia, Kryzhanovskiy 
said there was some friction but that it had set off no 
conflicts between the two nations. As for the idea of the 
incorporation of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea 
into Russia through a Crimean referendum, he said it would be 
the same as the incorporation of Russia's Kuril Islands into 
Japan on the basis of the results of a referendum by the Kurile 
population. "That's not serious," he said. 
  He said none of the former Soviet republics, including 
Russia, "has given a kopeck" to return Crimean Tatars to Crimea.

  [Text] Kiev, 8 Feb -- A working meeting of the Russian and 
Ukrainian groups of experts on the issue of elaborating specific 
mechanisms to implement the trilateral 
Russian-Ukrainian-American statement concerning nuclear 
disarmament began on 8 February. The Russian delegation is 
headed by Yuriy Dubinin, ambassador at large of the Russian 
Federation, and the Ukrainian delegation is headed by Valeriy 
Shmarov, vice-premier for issues of the military-industrial 
complex and conversion. "This is the latest phase of talks to 
develop the trilateral statement. Another such meeting would 
come in useful," Valeriy Shmarov informed a UNIAN correspondent 
in an exclusive interview. 
  "Several more statements have been prepared, and there is no 
doubt on the Ukrainian side that they will be signed. All 
issues will be resolved in strict compliance with the START I 
Treaty. There is already a draft program for implementing 
Ukrainian pledges: the share, quota, proportion, and procedure 
for recycling and taking silos out of a combat state--all this 
has been elaborated and is to be discussed." The meeting is 
scheduled to end 9 February.

  [Text] Kiev, 8 Feb -- "Officials from Ukraine's leadership 
circles have falsified the Ukrainian Supreme Council's 
resolution of 3 February 1994 [ratifying the START I Treaty]," 
People's Deputy Serhiy Holovatyy claims. 
  During the debate on a draft resolution on the trilateral 
statement by the Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian presidents, Deputy 
Serhiy Holovatyy put forward an amendment to Paragraph 2, as 
follows: "To this end (in order to exchange ratification 
certificates), government activity should be stepped up to 
conclude specific international agreements that follow from the 
reservations in the Supreme Council's resolution on the 
ratification of the START I Treaty." 
  This version of the resolution was approved by the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine. In the official text of the resolution, 
however, a different version of Paragraph 2 was presented. 
Namely, the words "to this end" were excluded. Thus, the 
contents of the Supreme Council's decision on this issue were 
essentially altered. The text of Paragraph 2 in its amended 
version makes provision for the following sequence of the 
Ukrainian Government's actions relating to the START I Treaty: 
First, concluding international agreements that proceed from 
the Supreme Council resolution and, in particular on granting 
Ukraine security guarantees, followed by an exchange of 
ratification certificates. 
  Such a sequence does not exist in the falsified text and 
this 
is why Mr. Holovatyy considers that it was stated that Ukraine 
lifted all reservations relating to the START I treaty, 
including also security guarantees. In fact, this does not 
conform with reality.

  [Text] Commenting on the message from Gazprom, the main 
supplier of Russian gas, to the effect that gas supplies to 
Ukrainian customers could be stopped, Stepan Belei, spokesman 
for the Ukrainian Cabinet, told Interfax-Ukraine that the 
Russian supplier was in dire financial straits because its 
Russian and other customers owed it about 10 trillion rubles. 
  Gazprom warned Ukraine again that the supplies might be 
stopped on February 9 unless the debt, 1.2 trillion rubles as of 
February 1, is paid. 
  According to Belei, Yefio Bvyagilsky, acting prime minister, 
had informed experts on an agreement reached with the Russian 
Government to the effect that Ukrainian supplies to Russia would 
be regarded as payment of the debt. 
  On the other hand, Stepan Yalovega, the spokesman for the 
Ukrainian State Oil and Gas Committee, told Interfax-Ukraine 
that the size of the debt mentioned in the Gazprom message came 
as a surprise. 
  Vasily Razgonyuk, chief engineer of the Ukrgazprom concern, 
said that it was up to the government to comment on the 
situation. In his words, the concern provided what amounted to 
an interest-free credit to all Ukrainian industries by supplying 
gas without demanding prepayment. "The industries have not paid 
us for last year's supplies," he said and added that the 
consumers owed Ukrgazprom over 10 trillion karbovantsi as of 
February 1.

  [Text] Kiev, 8 Feb -- A UNIAN correspondent has learned 
that new proposals regarding the division of the Black Sea Fleet 
have been prepared at Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. Compared 
to previous plans for resolving this issue, as well as the 
"sale" of the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet to decrease 
Kiev's debt for energy-carriers and granting the Russian side 
rights to a long- term lease of the Sevastopol naval base and 
virtually all of the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure, these 
proposals envisage Russian laws in force on the territory, which 
is leased. The proposals have been prepared for the meeting 
between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, which Boris 
Yeltsin requested of Leonid Kravchuk in a personal letter on 15 
January 1994.

  [Text] Kiev-Brussels -- During a visit to the Kingdom of 
Belgium on 8 February, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Anatoliy Zlenko signed the Partnership for Peace framework 
agreement proposed at the January summit of NATO member 
countries. The document envisages close ties between the 
republic and NATO, especially regarding reform in the armed 
forces, officer training, and joint exercises. It stipulates 
involvement of Ukraine's military subunits in UN and CSCE 
operations, open national defense and budget planning, 
democratic control over the military sphere, and exchange of 
relevant information. Partnership for Peace member countries 
can consult NATO members when faced with a direct threat to 
their territorial integrity, political independence, or 
security, but this does not imply security guarantees on the 
part of the NATO. 
  Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Borys Tarasyuk 
told UNIAN: "It is of special importance to Ukraine to be able 
to initiate such consultations, since Ukrainian political 
circles have for a long time been voicing concern over the 
state's security, especially in the wake of parliament's 
confirmation on 3 February of the country's intention to get rid 
of nuclear weapons completely." 
  "Membership in Partnership for Peace will enable Ukraine to 
build its armed forces on a new basis, approaching world 
standards, and involve its military subunits in various 
operations run by the UN and the CSCE which will enhance its 
authority," said Yuriy Serheyev, head of the information 
directorate at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commenting on 
the signing of the document.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report under the "Crimea" rubric: "Meeting </F>
Between President Meshkov and Admiral Baltin May Speed Up 
Determination of Black Sea Fleet Status"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Ukrainian mass media 
express fear that even before Yuriy Meshkov was elected 
president he constantly opposed the presence of Ukrainian army 
and national guard units in the peninsula, fearing that the 
Black Sea Fleet may turn into something similar to the Russian 
14th Army in the Dniester Region. 
  Observers believe that since Admiral Baltin effectively 
takes 
orders only from the defense minister and the commander in chief 
of the Russian Federation Navy (although the Black Sea Fleet is 
under the command of two presidents -- Russia's and Ukraine's), 
Boris Yeltsin should say his word regarding the situation. It 
cannot be ruled out that Yuriy Meshkov's election as Crimean 
president may speed up the determination of the Black Sea 
Fleet's status. 
  As is known, however, leaders of many Ukrainian parties and 
movements and a part of the Ukrainian parliament's deputy corps 
insist on a return to the Yalta agreements, while ignoring the 
latest ones -- those signed in Massandra. Observers believe 
that Boris Yeltsin will find himself in a difficult situation 
after the trilateral American-Russian-Ukrainian statement set 
forth the principle of the inviolability of borders. 
  Meanwhile, a confrontation between the Crimean president and 
the current lineup of the peninsula's Supreme Soviet is in the 
making. Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bagrov has taken 
a vacation after submitting an application requesting the 
parliament to accept his resignation. So far the resignation 
has not been accepted. The parliamentary session decided to 
return to the subject after Bagrov's return from vacation. 
Crimean Council of Ministers Chairman Boris Samsonov has also 
announced his resignation and taken a vacation. As many as 
three deputy Council of Ministers chairmen have suddenly gotten 
sick at the same time: Tatyana Krasikova, in charge of social 
matters; Pavel Pashkov, who supervises trade and consumer 
services; and Aleksandr Formanchuk, responsible for 
international affairs. An effective paralysis of power and a 
breakup in the peninsula's entire life-support system are now a 
realistic possibility. 
  For the time being, however, Yuriy Meshkov has announced the 
first appointments to his administration. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
wrote in summer 1992 about Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov, 
commander of the Crimean Army Corps, who was discharged from 
service by the Ukrainian defense minister. On 29 June 1992 he 
was elected Crimean Supreme Soviet deputy. Now Dmitriy Kuznets 
is a presidential military adviser. Colonel Valeriy Grishankov, 
former chief of the Crimean army corps' special department, who 
was dismissed following Kuznetsov, was appointed the president's 
chief of staff. Col. Vladimir Demin, a staffer at the special 
department, was discharged at the same time. Now he has the 
office of presidential adviser for foreign economic affairs. 
  It was together with Grishankov and Demin (and no one else) 
that Yuriy Meshkov flew for a meeting with Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk on 4 February. Information on the meeting was 
very scanty from both sides, but Igor Azarov, press secretary of 
the Crimean president, told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent on 8 February that "Kravchuk does not object to 
the simultaneous circulation of the Russian ruble and the 
Ukrainian karbovanets." "The president of the Republic of 
Crimea attempted to back away from concepts worked out by 
Nikolay Bagrov and to start everything from scratch," Igor 
Azarov said. The presidential press secretary also told your 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin called Yuriy Meshkov and that a meeting between Yeltsin 
and Meshkov "may take place in the very near future; currently 
it is being prepared." 
  Now about yet another appointment made by the Crimean 
president, one important for Meshkov's fledgling relations with 
the Crimean Tatar People's Assembly. Anife Seytumer-kyzy, a 
Crimean Tatar and president of the Crimean-Turkish trading 
house, Kara-Kaplan, has assumed the post of presidential adviser 
on national matters and relations with public organizations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch by </F>
Yuliya Mostovaya; place and date not given: "Ivan Plyushch: `I 
Categorically Disagree With Those Who Compare Zhirinovskiy With 
Meshkov'"] 
  [Text] Leonid Kravchuk presented to the press his 
opinion on the Crimean presidential elections long before the 
second round took place, noting that the Crimean people have the 
right to elect their president. However, he added that if the 
first president of the Crimea violates the Ukrainian 
Constitution or any other laws, the Ukrainian president will 
have the right to annul his resolutions. The position of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine was not so clear at that time. As 
everyone knows, many deputies stated that the Crimean elections 
were unconstitutional. I asked Supreme Council Chairman Ivan 
Plyushch to give his opinion on the results of the elections in 
the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. 
  [Plyushch] Elections in the Crimea have been held. I 
accepted the results of the first round, and likewise those of 
the second. According to the results of the second round, Yuriy 
Meshkov was elected the Crimean president. I always want to see 
more bright, white things than dark and dangerous ones. 
Therefore, as you know, we drafted constitutional resolutions 
that were discussed by the Supreme Council Constitutional 
Commission with the participation of committee chairmen and 
presidential representatives. Later, they were submitted to the 
Supreme Council for consideration. True, the drafts have not 
been approved, but they do contain a provision for the entire 
population of an oblast to elect an official to head the local 
council and executive authorities. The Crimea is one of our 
territories that has the status of an autonomous republic. 
Following the example of the Crimea, we develop relations 
between the center and regions. The first thing we did was 
therefore to adopt legislation on the division of economic 
powers between Kiev and the Crimea. I supported this at the 
time, and I continue to do so, since it does not make any sense 
to govern everything from the center, as was previously done 
from Moscow. Replacing Moscow with Kiev does not make any 
sense. By doing so, we would have 25 cabinets of ministers all 
over Ukraine. Everything that is provided for by basic 
constitutional resolutions has taken place in the Crimea -- they 
have elected a president who will head the executive branch. 
The fate of the legislative branch is, as yet, unknown. Yet, 
according to Crimean legislation, their president has no right 
to dissolve the Crimean Supreme Council or ordain a referendum 
on confidence or nonconfidence in the Crimean parliament. This 
means that there is no problem. The legislative body elected by 
the Crimean people is still functioning. Although Mykola Bahrov 
tendered his resignation following consultations with members of 
the Supreme Council Presidium, or maybe with somebody else, it 
was decided to send him off on leave, to let him relax after his 
disappointment. Meanwhile, the Crimean Supreme Council will 
continue to operate under Maslov, who has to perform the duties 
of its chairman. A plenary session is to be held today, at 
which Crimean President Meshkov will deliver a speech and take 
the oath of office. 
  I am glad that Yuriy Meshkov, neither during the first round 
of elections nor the second one, nor at press conferences, has 
said that he would pursue a course of separating the Crimea from 
Ukraine. Regarding his statements on broad and close integration 
with Russia and an economic zone, may God grant that this 
happens. If regions integrate economically, it will be easier 
for Ukraine to integrate with foreign countries. I would not 
like to make a problem out of this. One should try to gain some 
experience from this issue. Although Meshkov says that he does 
not see any forms of cooperation with Russia and Ukraine at the 
moment, I believe that our legislation provides for such forms. 
Still, there are certain acts adopted by the Crimean 
legislature which do not conform to Ukrainian ones. Our 
Committee for Legal and Legislative Issues has therefore listed 
discrepancies between the two sets of legislation. The Crimea 
has also obtained this list. We have asked our Crimean 
colleagues to adjust their legislation to meet that of Ukraine. 
I believe that, after a meeting between the Ukrainian and 
Crimean presidents, and following an official statement by 
Leonid Kravchuk, this issue will again be addressed. Although 
there are various ways of achieving this, I am for consolidation 
rather than confrontation. 
  I categorically disagree with those who compare Zhirinovskiy 
with Meshkov and what is taking place in Russia with 
developments in the Crimea. I do not see the elections as 
Bahrov's defeat and Meshkov's victory. More than 70 percent of 
the people voted for an improvement of life on the peninsula. 
They want everything to remain as it was in the past -- they 
want all nationalists, from the near and far abroad, to continue 
visiting the Crimea, the economic zone to continue functioning, 
and mutually beneficial ties to continue developing. If Meshkov 
manages to achieve this, of course without leaving Ukraine, I 
will praise him and be envious of his successes. If he fails to 
do so, well, not everyone can succeed. 
  [Mostovaya] Ivan Stepanovych, what do you think about 
the tripartite declaration signed in Moscow? 
  [Plyushch] My opinion about the declaration is unequivocally 
positive. I think that it was the only possible decision in 
terms of sense, although its form is not perfect. However, we 
are only a subject of the tripartite declaration. Could we 
dictate the form? Of course not. I would have surely preferred, 
as a citizen and an official, that Clinton had met with Kravchuk 
not at the airport but at his official residence, as with any 
other state leader.... I believe that this declaration was yet 
another step toward satisfying the Supreme Council's 
reservations about the 18 November resolution on ratifying the 
START I treaty. Although the declaration includes a chapter 
concerning other types of nonnuclear strategic weapons, we 
should not make a problem out of this. Let us liquidate the 
nuclear weapons first, and then we will talk about other types 
of strategic offensive arms. I believe that this declaration 
not only gives us guarantees, but also prevents territorial 
claims and interference in Ukraine's internal affairs. This 
agreement came in the very nick of time, since it included 
security guarantees for us. Even if they were not formulated as 
we wished, they are still better than none. 
  [Mostovaya] Will the current parliament examine the 
tripartite declaration? 
  [Plyushch] Although it is very hard for me to speak about 
this, I do not think that the declaration is an agreement. 
Therefore, it is not subject to ratification by parliament. 
Moreover, the document was signed on behalf of Ukraine, Russia, 
and the United States. Only agreements, not declarations, are 
signed this way. Although there are some flaws, this is not the 
most important aspect. The most important thing is that the 
declaration answers the reservations put forward by the 
legislature on 18 November. Therefore, I believe that the 
current Supreme Council should decide whether or not the 
tripartite declaration signed by our president conforms to the 
resolution concerning the START I treaty. 
  [Mostovaya] Yet the president has requested that the 
issue of acceding to the treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons also be examined.... 
  [Plyushch] This will be the responsibility of the next 
Supreme Council. It will depend on how the provisions of the 
tripartite declaration are fulfilled. Such issues should not be 
rushed.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Press Service of the Congress of National </F>
Democratic Forces [KNDS] on Meshkov's Victory in the Crimea: 
The Policy of Temporizing Has Turned Out To Be the Worst"; 
issued in Kiev on 31 Jan] 
  [Text] The adherence both by the citizens and all branches 
of the authorities to the Main Law is a guarantee of stability 
in the state. Unfortunately, Ukraine belongs to those states 
where the Constitution is ignored by many political parties and 
authorities. The guarantor of the Constitution -- the president 
of Ukraine -- while following the course of this process, 
constantly resorts to self-vindicating statements. 
  The election of the president of the Crimean autonomous 
region was a blatant violation of Ukrainian laws, including the 
Constitution. The elections were held in an atmosphere of acute 
Ukrainophobia and had an obvious backing from the "ruble zone" 
patrons. By that time, the Ukrainian state leadership had 
traditionally occupied a temporizing and so-called balanced 
position. 
  These circumstances and the economic situation in the state 
have brought the leader of the Crimean Republican Movement 
[RDK], Meshkov, and the political bloc "Rossiya" [Russia] to 
executive power. The Russian Federation has acquired yet 
another lever for putting pressure upon Ukraine. This concerns, 
in particular, the Black Sea Fleet and the deployment of the 
Russian Armed Forces on the territory of the Ukrainian state. 
The Russian mass media, first and foremost "Ostankino" 
television and the VESTI news agency, stated, one after the 
other, that the Crimea is adopting a new political course. 
  The RDK leader received almost half the votes of the adult 
population. Therefore, the results of the voting have shown 
that the Crimean population has really taken a new course 
oriented toward Russia, the economic transformations promised by 
it, and the financial injections. 
  That is why the results of the Crimean presidential 
elections 
must also become a basis for a fundamental revision of Ukraine's 
economic policy. The success achieved by the separatist Meshkov 
is also a consequence of the absence in Ukraine of a clear 
information policy aimed at strengthening statehood. 
  Even before the second round of the elections, Meshkov 
announced that, on 27 March, he would hold a referendum on 
independence. We believe that the policy of temporizing has 
turned out to be the worst for Ukraine. The events of recent 
months have shown that Ukraine's state leadership has no proper 
influence upon the regions. How can the executive represented by 
the RDK be loyal to Kiev, if one of its proclaimed tasks is the 
achievement of the peninsula's full independence...?

Democratic Forces

  [Text] Donetsk -- On 8 February approximately 3,000 persons 
refused to work at the Chelyuskintsiv mine of the Donetsk Coal 
production association. A spontaneous rally of miners began 
outside the mine at 1200. Ivan Pashko, head of the mine's trade 
union committee, said in a conversation with a UNIAN 
correspondent: "The first thing which the miners are demanding 
is the payment of money earned by them. Neither do we have 
sufficient funds to provide material and technical for the work 
to go smoothly." 
  On the same day the Northern mine of the Dzerzhinsk Coal 
association stopped work. The strike at a mine of the Artemovsk 
Coal association is continuing, and the Torez Anthracite 
association is preparing for a strike.

<F P=106> [From the "Postfactum Radio" feature] </F>
  [Text] Today, a session of the Presidium of the Belarusian 
Scientific-Industrial Association was held. It is obvious that 
the most important issue in its agenda was the issue of the 
merger of the Belarusian and Russian financial systems. 
Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich delivered a speech 
at this session. We are going to broadcast excerpts of his 
speech addressing the gist of the protocol of the session of the 
Russian-Belarusian commission of experts. 
  [Begin Kebich recording] Within three months, beginning with 
the date of the merger of our monetary systems, the Republic of 
Belarus will conduct payments of wages to staff employed in the 
state budget sector according to a single wage scale, which is 
being used in the Russian Federation. Belarus will finance 
measures to ensure the social protection of the population at 
the expense of the Republic's budget. However, this does not 
mean that social payments will equal similar ones in Russia. 
The National Bank of Belarus will allot credits -- at amounts 
which were agreed upon with the Russian Finance Ministry and the 
Central Bank of Russia -- to the Belarusian Government, 
commercial banks of Belarus, and other loan providers. The 
National Bank of Belarus can buy hard currency, precious stones, 
and other valuables only at the request and at the expense of 
the Belarusian Government and other legal bodies, and at the 
expense of its own funds and profits. The National Bank of 
Belarus buys payment notes, cash, and Russian currency above the 
amount which it will receive within the single exchange of money 
resulting from the monetary system merger [words indistinct] and 
performs noncash transactions [words indistinct]. Correspondent 
accounts will only be used for the sake of recording our mutual 
accounts. This will differ from the current situation, whereby 
these accounts are used to rigidly control (?the accounts), they 
will only record trade operations performed between Russian and 
Belarus. When the National Bank of Belarus hands back the 
Russian payment notes, the Central Bank of Russia will transfer 
appropriate sums to corresponding accounts in the National Bank 
of Belarus. 
  The establishment of the exchange rate of the Russian and 
Belarusian currencies is based on methods drafted by the Russian 
National Committee for Statistics, located in Belarus, and 
proceeds from the buying power of the national currencies and 
[words indistinct]. The establishment of an exchange rate for 
the Russian and Belarusian currencies is closely linked with 
other procedures tied with the merger of the monetary systems 
and the change of price scales in Belarus, so as not to bring 
about, on the one hand, a decrease in net income and savings of 
private individuals and legal bodies, and, on the other hand, an 
increase in inflation in the newly merged financial system. The 
Belarusian side, agreeing in general to the above-mentioned 
methods of establishing an exchange rate for the Russian and 
Belarusian currencies, proposes to estimate the monetary 
resources of the population at a one-to-one rate, including 
cash, savings, and deposit accounts. 
  The parties state that the creation of [words indistinct] 
equal conditions for mutual trade, a single mechanism for 
formulating free [word indistinct] prices, the distribution of 
domestic Russian prices for energy and other recourses on the 
territory of Belarus, the lifting of export customs duties on 
trade between Russia and Belarus constitute the obligatory 
condition for the existence of the single financial system. 
Therefore, [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has also touched 
upon the issue of a political strike which, as you know, is 
scheduled to take place on 15 February. 
  [Begin Kebich recording] The situation is difficult [words 
indistinct]. We (?will undertake all the measures to not permit 
this strike.) The situation is different in various regions of 
Belarus. However, [words indistinct]. The task is to [words 
indistinct]. In my opinion, I do not have to agitate for [words 
indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] An intergovernmental agreement on the unification of 
the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus is planned to be 
signed by February 17, 1994, Belarusian First Deputy Prime 
Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich told a press conference today. He 
pointed out that the two countries' central banks, finance and 
external economic relations ministries had already signed the 
corresponding agreements. 
  The first deputy prime minister also told the journalists of 
the results of the working meeting of experts of the 
Russian-Belarusian interstate commission on the unification of 
the two countries' monetary systems which ended in Minsk 
recently. 
  Myasnikovich said the experts agreed that, firstly, it is 
necessary to equalize prices to ensure the two countries' 
successful trade. In particular, the prices of fuel sold to 
Belarus must be equal to Russia's internal prices. In addition, 
it is necessary to lift all customs duties in bilateral trade. 
  Secondly, the two countries will not merge their budget 
systems since they agreed that the shares of deficit in their 
GDP must be proportional. (In 1993, Russia's budget deficit was 
10.5% of GDP, while it was 6% in Belarus - Interfax's note.) 
  Thirdly, Myasnikovich said that cash Belarusian rubles will 
be exchanged for Russian ones at the rate of 1:1. Belarus needs 
to put in its circulation about 700 billion Russian rubles, 
while the republic's aggregate money supply at the moment is 2.1 
trillion rubles, according to Myasnikovich. The rate for 
non-cash exchange will be set according to statistical data on 
the purchasing strength of the two countries' monetary units at 
the moment of unification. 
  Judged by this parameter, the Russian ruble was stronger 
than 
the Belarusian one by 2.19 times on January 1, 1994, according 
to the Russian and Belarussian statistics committees. Experts 
of the International Monetary Fund say the ratio will be 1:2.5 
by March 1. 
  Fourthly, Belarusian wages should be roughly equal to 
Russian 
wages. At present, the gap between them is by about 3 times, 
that is why the experts agreed that the salaries of employees of 
state bodies will be re-calculated within three months of the 
beginning of the unification. 
  Finally, the two countries' correspondent accounts with the 
counterpart central bank will play a passive role as they will 
only keep the payments register. 
  Myasnikovich said the experts were finalizing disputable 
issues related to the unification in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Tsygankov report under the "Belarus" rubric: </F>
"Stakes Are Big in Merging Belarus and Russia Monetary Systems. 
They Are Power in the Republic"] 
  [Text] For three days, groups of experts of Belarus and 
Russia were in session at a government residence not far from 
Minsk. They were discussing one more time the mechanisms and 
terms for merging both countries' monetary systems. 
  First Vice Premier Mikhail Myasnikovich stated in a news 
conference that accord had been reached on the question most 
painful for Belarus -- single prices of energy resources. In 
the meantime, according to Myasnikovich, Belarus buys Russian 
oil at $77 per tonne whereas Moscow sells it at $45 to its 
internal consumers. The same ratio of $75 against $17 applies 
to gas. Responding to the Russian claim that single energy 
prices were a disadvantage for Russia, the Belarus experts spoke 
about the advantages Russia has: free transit of all types of 
transport across Belarus territory, gas pipelines and oil 
pipelines, the free-of-charge presence of Russian strategic 
troops on the republic's territory. 
  As some politicians and observers think, Moscow has no 
reason 
for agreeing to single prices. They argue that once Belarus 
volunteers (especially in the wake of Shushkevich's resignation) 
as it does for the closest possible union with Russia, it should 
be set the toughest terms. Thus, it is quite natural that the 
question of including Belarus in Russia's monetary system is 
political first and foremost. Belarus Prime Minister Kebich, 
who has placed the main political chips on the merger, obviously 
realizes this too. 
  Scoring a success here is especially important for him in 
light of the impending all-Belarus political strike. At this 
point, not only opposition politicians and bankers, but some 
ministers, too, also realize the danger of the action being 
undertaken. Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned 
by chance about a conference in one of the ministries where its 
head was painting for his staff a sad prospect of the agency's 
work after the merger of the monetary systems. None the less, a 
brief effect of external improvement in the wake of the 
"rubleization" of Belarus is supposed to take place. Realizing 
this, Kebich, together with his cabinet, hypes the successes of 
another round of talks, insisting especially that cash is 
supposed to be exchanged at a one-for-one rate. 
  The Russian delegation, as the talks have shown, is not too 
eager so far to agree to go along with such a fabulous rate as 
far as Belarus is concerned. However, as the prime minister 
stated to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent: "The experts' 
business is to work, but it is up to the two premiers to say the 
last word on prices and the level of rates."

  [Text] Minsk February 8 TASS -- The so-called unification 
of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems, which actually means 
Belarusian merging with the Russian monetary system, is nothing 
but "disarmament" of the Belarusian economy and state in the 
face of more powerful Russian capital and enterprise, says a 
statement of the Belarusian parliamentary opposition 
representing the Belarusian Popular Front. 
  In the opinion of 23 signatories to the document, the 
unification of monetary systems and its consequences will result 
in Belarusians' work for alien masters and the alien state. The 
republic will become a free corridor for tax-free transit of 
russian gas, oil and raw materials to the west. 
  The statement claims unilateral orientation at the east has 
inflicted on Belarus enormous losses in clearing goods exchange. 
For instance, Belarus pays 128 U.S. dollars for a ton of Russian 
oil, which costs 91 U.S. dollars at the Rotterdam Exchange. 
  The opposition deputies called for an all-Belarusian 
political rally to demand resignation of the government, 
dissolution of the parliament and democratic elections.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] Today, the meeting of the Ministry of Interior 
Collegium of the Republic of Moldova was held in Chisinau. The 
meeting was attended by President Mircea Snegur. Minister of 
Interior Constantin Antoci read the report on the activity of 
the employees of the Ministry in the year 1993 and on future 
tasks. According to the report of the Press Service of the 
Presidency, in the speech made on this occasion, Mr. Mircea 
Snegur generally assessed the way in which the active personnel 
of the police forces fulfilled their specific tasks and said 
that, in order to return people's confidence, it is necessary to 
double the efforts made by the police force. 
  President Snegur said that 75 percent of the total crimes 
represent economic crimes and this means knife blows applied to 
reform. The president of the Republic of Moldova insisted on 
the need to train certain experts to obtain a high degree of 
qualification, emphasized the increasing role played by the 
National Police Academy `Stefan cel Mare' and expressed his 
belief that the police troops must be increased and not reduced, 
the way certain political formations suggest. 
  Also today, President Mircea Snegur signed the decree on the 
appointment of Mr. Aurelian Danila to the position of ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Moldova in 
the Republic of Austria. Mr. Aurelian Danila is currently 
ambassador of the Republic of Moldova in Romania. 
  Also today, the discussions on the draft treaty on the civil 
and penal legal assistance between the Republic of Moldova and 
Romania began at the Ministry of Justice in Chisinau. The 
International Relations Service of the ministry and the 
commission that was approved through a decree issued by 
President Mircea Snegur, examine the proposals made in 
connection with this document. According to the announcement of 
the Press Center of the Ministry of Justice, the place and date 
of negotiations and the signing of the aforementioned treaty 
will be announced soon.

Shmelev] 
  [Text] Almaty February 9 TASS -- The Russian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Andrey Kozyrev, held a press conference after 
spending two-and-a-half hours in talks behind closed doors with 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan. 
  Kozyrev told reporters both sides made clear their desire to 
conduct in a business-like manner -- without dragging feet or 
making haste -- preparations for the next Commonwealth summit 
meeting. "It is time we had such a meeting because many mutual 
problems can be resolved only at the presidential level," 
Kozyrev said. 
  Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, Kozyrev said that 
during his talks with Nazarbayev, they reached an agreement on 
focusing preparations on three main points -- the drafting of an 
agreement on military cooperation, for which some points of 
principle have already been agreed; cooperation in Baykonur, 
which Kozyrev is due to visit on Thursday to take a closer look 
at the situation in the former Soviet space centre; and aspects 
of double citizenship and a humanitarian package. 
  The Russian minister dwelled in detail on the last point, 
because it was given much time and attention during his talks 
with Nazarbayev. This problems is most serious since it 
concerns very many people in Kazakhstan and Russia. But it 
should not be politicized or ideologized, or else viewed as 
inter-ethnic, Kozyrev said. Such an approach would play into 
the hand of nationalists in all Commonwealth countries. He said 
the question was of special concern to ethnic Russian and 
Russian-speaking people who found themselves in a very 
vulnerable situation as a result of current historical changes. 
  The big, central treaty to be signed by Russian with 
Kazakhstan will contain a package of agreements on these matters 
with solutions proposed at a world practice level. 
  The cardinal solution of the problem consists in giving 
every 
Russian and Kazakh the opportunity to fully exercise their 
rights. When moving from one country to the other, none of them 
should feel a foreigner. Other solutions to particular problems 
will be found, since the presidents of both countries think it 
necessary to speed up their preparation, including the drafting 
of the agreement on citizenship, in time for the 
Russian-Kazakhstan summit. 
  All this inspires hope that by the time of the signing of 
the 
bilateral agreements, all demagoguery will have exhausted its 
potential in this respect, Kozyrev said. Kozyrev was evidently 
referring to the position of Russian nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy and other fascist-like and nationalist circles, 
who, according to Kozyrev, are seeking to fan the issue in order 
to aggravate the political struggle and bank on it. 
  They have no thought for the people when they seek to push 
nations to the verge of war. The problem can be solved by 
taking into account the interests of different ethnic groups on 
the basis of civilized, legal and peaceful approaches, Kozyrev 
said. 
  The Commonwealth is moving towards economic integration but 
not towards a split, Kozyrev stressed. This understanding was 
made clear to him during his visits to Tashkent and Almaty. "We 
reached an agreement with President Nazarbayev on setting up 
working groups which will work fast and on a fundamental basis. 
  Kozyrev resolutely rejected allegations of territorial 
claims 
between Commonwealth member states.

  [Text] London, 8 Feb -- A broad range of issues, first and 
foremost the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, were discussed today 
during the meeting between Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, who is in Britain on an official visit, and 
Minister for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Douglas Hurd. 
ITAR-TASS was told at the Foreign Office that the head of 
Britain's foreign affairs department called the exchange of 
views "quite useful," but also asked Yerevan to take specific 
measures to settle the conflict situation in this region, which 
is causing justifiable concern in London. 
  Levon Ter-Petrosyan explained his country's position on this 
problem and confirmed his support for the process of finding a 
political settlement started within the CSCE framework which, in 
his opinion, represents the best way to normalize the situation 
in this region. The Armenian president said the Russian 
Federation not only enjoys influence in the southern Caucasus 
but "should play a key role there."

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is satisfied 
with the readiness of the Uzbek leadership to discuss all 
issues, including the situation with the Russian-speaking 
population, and to work out solutions to these problems. The 
Russian foreign minister expressed his satisfaction at a press 
conference in Tashkent on Tuesday [8 February] after the 
negotiations with Uzbek Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Said Asymov. 
  "These are sharp issues for people but we work to ease them 
and not to aggravate the situation through deterioration of 
state political relations," Kozyrev emphasized. He suggested 
that there would be "good draft proposals," including the ones 
on humanitarian issues worked out for the Russian-Uzbek summit 
in Moscow planned for February 25. 
  Earlier, when speaking at the Russian Embassy in Tashkent, 
Kozyrev pointed out that the situation with human rights of the 
Russian-speaking population had changed in comparison with that 
during his previous visit in November, 1993. "It is hard to give 
a definite evaluation. However, the element of mutual 
misunderstanding seems to have decreased," Kozyrev said. 
  He met with about 50 representatives of the Russian-speaking 
population gathered near the embassy. According to them, there 
were incidents connected with violation of human rights and even 
physical injuries. 
  Kozyrev announced that the parties had discussed not only 
juridical and humanitarian issues but also economic ones aimed 
at strengthening the economic union. In his words, the issue on 
a single system of settlement and correlation of the currencies' 
exchange rates was high on the agenda. 
  The military-political issues were also discussed. "I think 
we can recommend that the president sign a treaty on 
military-political cooperation with Uzbekistan," Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is touring 
Central Asian countries. He spent the whole day today in 
Tashkent, where he held talks with the president of Uzbekistan. 
  [Correspondent Shakhnoza Ganiyeva] Andrey Kozyrev's working 
visit to Uzbekistan today began with talks at the republican 
Foreign Ministry. Subsequently he was received by Uzbekistan 
President Islam Karimov in the second half of the day. 
  The most acute problems of economic, military, political, 
and 
humanitarian cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan and also 
aspects of Islam Karimov's official visit to Russia, due toward 
the end of February, were discussed at the meeting. 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] I think that we will arrive at a 
correct solution, so that we can help people as much as possible 
and irrespective of their nationality -- and this also includes 
the Russian and Russophone population and also other citizens of 
both republics, both states -- so that they can cross the border 
with ease and exchange money and dispose of their property as 
they see fit. These, in actual fact, are the issues people are 
interested in. Also, so that we can, of course, remove whatever 
tensions, as it were, that might arise in connection with the 
language and so on. 
  These issues must be dealt with professionally, 
dispassionately, without superfluous emotions, even though the 
problems themselves are extraordinarily emotive. However, they 
must be tackled in a level-headed manner. 
  I think that at any rate, we have made yet another step 
toward ensuring that these issues are examined in a correct 
manner and that they can be generally resolved when the two 
presidents have their meeting. [end recording]

  [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is in 
Tashkent on a working visit. Let's listen to a report by our 
correspondent Maya Ganiyeva. 
  [Ganiyeva] The agenda for his brief visit is extremely 
packed. The day started with a meeting with representatives of 
the Russian diaspora in the embassy of the Russian Federation in 
Uzbekistan. The conversation was brief, and afterwards Kozyrev 
went to have talks with the republic's Foreign Minister 
Saidmukhtar Saidkasymov. Later, in the afternoon, he was 
received by Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov. At this 
meeting the most important problems of economic, 
military-political, and humanitarian cooperation between Russia 
and Uzbekistan as well as matters of Islam Karimov's official 
visit to Russia scheduled for the end of February were discussed. 
  In an interview for our program Andrey Kozyrev said: 
  [Begin recording] [Kozyrev] Our main problem is how to 
transfer our friendly relations onto a new track. In the 
conditions of the existence of independent states, a great many 
issues arise. But it must be said that we are examining them in 
a calm, businesslike, very frank way. And I think that we will 
find correct solutions here so as to give the maximum possible 
assistance to the Russian population and also other citizens in 
both states so that they will be able to easily cross the 
border, exchange money, and dispose of their property -- this is 
what people are really interested it -- well, and, of course, 
remove tension arising on the basis of language, etc. Here, it 
seems to me, the Uzbek side is displaying a very constructive, 
specific approach -- not an ideological one -- and we do not 
want to ideologize or politicize these matters in some way. 
  [Ganiyeva] Andrey Vladimirovich, what is the view of 
Russia's 
Foreign Policy Department on the trilateral economic union of 
the Central Asian states? 
  [Kozyrev] Any accords between the republics -- if they 
benefit their economic revival -- these can only be to Russia's 
advantage. [end recording]

resolutions will be compulsory for ministries, companies, 
factories and offices and local government bodies.

  [Text] The Georgian Government called on Moscow to impose 
urgent measures to stop "the policy of genocide against ethnic 
Georgians" carried out by Abkhaz separatists in Gudauta. 
  Its statement was read out in parliament by Deputy Speaker 
Vakhtang Rcheushvili in Tbilisi late on Tuesday. 
  It speaks of a disastrous situation in the Abkhkazian region 
of Gal in which five other Georgian villages were razed to the 
ground following the return of Georgian refugees from western 
Georgia. In the last few days, as many as 60 people were shot 
dead and dozens of others taken hostage in that region. Over 
800 houses were destroyed. 
  The official said some 3,000 Georgians had been forced to 
flee for shelter to nearby woods and that Tbilisi was now trying 
to find a way of helping them. 
  Ten other busloads of militants from the Northern Caucasus 
arrived in Abkhazia on Monday and Tuesday, the Deputy Speaker 
said referring to anonymous sources.

  [Text] Recent events in Abkhazia show clearly that by 
disregarding the Geneva agreements on a peaceful settlement of 
the conflict in Abkhazia and Russia's mediation, the separatists 
have again embarked on the path of violence and bloodshed. 
  On 5 February of this year, villages in the so-called upper 
zone of Gali Rayon were barbarically despoiled and burned down 
by Gudauta militants, who arrived on 16 Ikarus buses and were 
armed with 10 pieces of heavy equipment. 
  All this was carried out on the false pretext of the 
elimination of Georgian guerrilla units hiding in the rayon. 
  The villages of Okhumi and Mukhuri were burned down. Some 
100 residential houses were burned down in other villages. 
  About 3,000 civilians in the rayon who represented not only 
Georgian but also other nationalities were driven by separatists 
into the surrounding woods, where the snow level is reaching one 
and a half meters. In effect, defenseless women and children 
were condemned to death from cold and starvation. 
  In the village of Okumi, dozens of civilians were killed in 
a 
punitive raid carried out by Cossack militants. 
  This morning Abkhaz separatists, with the active support of 
their North Caucasian hirelings, launched an offensive on 
Tsalenjikha Rayon in western Georgia, where refugees from the 
upper zone [of Gali Rayon] were trying to find shelter.

  [Text] Sochi, 9 Feb -- The Republic of Abkhazia's Armed 
Forces are completing the operation to neutralize the 
inidividual groupings of Georgian armed formations which 
infiltrated Gali Rayon, Abkhazia. An ITAR-TASS correspondent has 
learned from a well-informed source within republican leadership 
that Abkhazian formations have taken under guard the main 
cascade of the Inguri GES, a motor road bridge across the river 
Inguri as well as a number of important industrial facilities. 
Local operations are being conducted in individual sections of 
the coastal area of Gali Rayon. According to the above 
official, combat operations in the republic's border rayon will 
be completed in a day or two. 
  Earlier, in the morning, two coaches with Abkhazian 
servicemen exploded on a mine in the center of the town of Gali. 
The explosion killed four people and injured nine.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, </F>
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Sergey Shoygu, chairman 
of the Russian State Committee for Emergency Situations, Boris 
Pastukhov, Russian first deputy minister for foreign affairs, 
Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Interim Committee for the 
State of Emergency Under the Head of State, head of the Georgian 
delegation at the Geneva talks on a settlement of the Abkhazian 
conflict, by Inga Abgarova and Tinatin Gviniashvili in Tbilisi 
on 3 February : "The Participants in the Negotiations Speak"] 
  [Text] General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation 
minister of defense: 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What have you agreed upon today 
at the meeting with the Georgian side? 
  [Grachev] We have signed a protocol on intent; I have in 
mind the setting up of Russian military bases in Georgia. The 
establishment of three bases is planned: in Tbilisi, in the 
region of Vaziani, Akhalkalaki, and Batumi. The Batumi base 
will have branches in Sukhumi, Poti, and Gudauta. They will be 
created on the basis of troops of the Group of Russian Forces in 
the Transcaucasus [GRFT] currently located in these areas. 
These are primarily ground troops and air forces; helicopters, 
a few Su-25 type attack aircraft, and some fighter-bomber 
aircraft. The plan includes stationing Black Sea Fleet warships 
in the Poti region. Where a specific base will be located and 
the operational task it will fulfill will depend on geography. 
They will be set up by 1 July 1994. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What will be the direct tasks of 
these bases? 
  [Grachev] Ensuring the security of Russia and the states in 
the Transcaucasus region that are part of the Treaty on 
Collective Security. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Has the question of border troops 
been resolved? 
  [Grachev] I can only say that the joint border between 
Georgia and Russia that exists today will not be moved. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Pavel Sergeyevich, has the 
question of bringing the Russian troops deployed in Abkhazia 
under the command of GRFT commander General Reut finally been 
resolved? 
  [Grachev] All troops located in Georgia are subordinate to 
General Reut with the exception of the 345th Airborne Regiment. 
This regiment is directly subordinate to me and is my strategic 
reserve. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] To whom will the Russian troops 
who are to fulfill the role of peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia 
be subordinate, and who will finance them? 
  [Grachev] The peacekeeping forces will be under the command 
of Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, deputy defense minister. 
As for their financing, this is a painful question. We still 
do not have a UN Security Council mandate enabling Russian 
troops carrying out a peacekeeping mission in countries of the 
former USSR to be peacekeepers under the aegis of the UN. 
Therefore, they do not pay us and we have to bear the expenses 
ourselves. Nevertheless, we are not abandoning our mission, 
viewing Georgia as a single entity. However, this is both 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
  Dzhaba Ioseliani, member of Parliament, chairman of the 
Interim Committee for the State of Emergency: 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Batono [Georgian polite form of 
address] Dzhaba, how effective is the method of settling 
Abkhazian problems by means of the deployment of Russian 
peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone? 
  [Ioseliani] I do not see any other way out of the situation 
that has been created. This is the most civilized way. The 
peacekeeping forces will, I hope, be able to restore order and 
peace on Abkhazian land. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Was the question of the return of 
refugees to Abkhazia examined separately? 
  [Ioseliani] We presented to the Russian side a plan for the 
stage-by-stage return of the refugees. Work on it will be 
recorded in a document. I am certain that everything will be 
fine as far as this question is concerned. 
  Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation minister of foreign 
affairs: 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] It is no secret that there were 
many people in Russia who were opposed to the president coming 
to Tbilisi and signing a treaty with Georgia. How do you, as a 
diplomat, assess this step and the significance of the visit? 
  [Kozyrev] Boris Nikolayevich is president and, as such, on 
hearing all opinions, he adopts the only courageous decision 
that immediately represents a significant step forward. The 
most important thing in the signing of this treaty is that it is 
a huge incentive to achieve a political settlement in Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia. This is the most important thing. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] The problem of returning refugees 
to Abkhazia is of great concern to us.... 
  [Kozyrev] To us also. I hope that a decision will be 
adopted on the signing of an agreement that is coordinated with 
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which will result in the 
beginning of this process. This is a key issue and it is very 
strange that certain difficulties have arisen precisely with the 
Georgian side. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Nevertheless, as it turns out, 
Russia's interests in Georgia are great. 
  [Kozyrev] Russia's strategic and geopolitical interests have 
always been closely connected with Georgia. I do not think we 
should fear such an expression as Russia's vital interests; and, 
on the other side, Georgia's vis-a-vis Russia. The only problem 
is that we should regard this visit by President Yeltsin to 
Georgia not as a substitute for efforts to regulate the 
conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia but, on the contrary, as 
an incentive to achieve a settlement. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] How do you see the future of 
Abkhazia? 
  [Kozyrev] I believe that the future of Abkhazia lies within 
the sphere of the territorial integrity of Georgia; in the 
acquisition by it of the corresponding political, legal, and 
economic status and in the division of powers and rights 
between, let us say, the center and Abkhazia. If both sides 
show enough common sense and do not aim for a resolution of this 
problem by force, they will be able to take advantage of this 
propitious chance and the services offered by Russia, and 
develop some kind of principle that will enable both Abkhazia 
and Georgia to occupy themselves on the whole not with military 
but peaceful matters. 
General Sergey Shoygu, chairman of the Russian State 
Committee for Emergency Situations: 
  "The Abkhazian problem will be regulated if the sides do not 
hinder this." 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] General, do you think that, this 
time, Russia will cope with its role as peacekeeper in Georgia? 
  [Shoygu] Yes, provided the Georgian and Abkhazian sides do 
not hinder this. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What about the last time...? 
  [Shoygu] Last time: I said two weeks prior to your surrender 
of Sukhumi that all this will end in a big war. I will not 
participate in this bloodbath. That was why I tendered my 
resignation. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What is your prediction regarding 
events in Abkhazia? 
  [Shoygu] A most sad one. Look, we are returning to what we 
should have done four months ago. I suggested bringing into 
Abkhazia a regiment under the control of UN observers in order 
to establish order. The same thing is now being suggested but I 
think the opportunity has been missed. 
  Boris Pastukhov, Russian Federation first deputy 
minister of foreign affairs: 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Mr. Pastukhov, you participated 
directly in the resolution of questions concerning the conflict 
in Abkhazia and Georgian problems in general. What, in your 
view, awaits Russian-Georgian relations in the future? 
  [Pastukhov] Our full-fledged cooperation, including economic 
cooperation, is only just beginning. The point is that we all 
have had considerable success in destroying and wrecking a lot 
of things. Moreover, what is now going on in our countries is 
retribution. 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Do you think that the 
ratification of the treaty signed today will be a problem in the 
Russian Duma? 
  [Pastukhov] No treaties are ratified without problems. 
However, in this case, much depends on how we work in the sphere 
of regulation and whether we prove our good intentions with 
deeds: So that the treaty does not remain empty words but 
becomes something of principle, something big, and something 
that will guide the destiny of our peoples.

  [Text] Juri Kahn, ambassador of the Republic of Estonia to 
Moscow, has been charged with the task of protesting in 
connection with the continued Russian campaign of statements 
which fabricate and distort reality in the Republic of Estonia. 
This was reported to BNS [Baltic News Service] today by the 
Estonian Foreign Ministry's press service. The ministry's press 
representative, Mari-Ann Rikken, said that Juri Kahn is due to 
present Estonia's protest to Russian officials in the course of 
the day. 
  Repeated attempts by top Russian officials to stick 
slanderous labels to Estonia have been directed at influencing 
the world public and international organizations. These are 
attempts to isolate Estonia [words indistinct] The news item 
states that Estonian legislation allows every individual to 
acquire citizenship regardless of their ethnic origin. Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated yesterday that about one 
third of the population in Estonia and in other Baltic countries 
is being segregated along the ethnic principle.

<F P=106> [Video report by Heimar Lenk--from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] From the first meeting, the most important question 
for the Estonian side has been the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from the republic and the most important for the Russian side 
has been the protection of its citizens on the territory of 
independent Estonia. Evidently neither of the sides intends to 
retreat from their initial positions. Estonia has not softened 
its conditions for local Russians to receive Estonian 
citizenship. Russia, just as it promised three years ago, 
intends to withdraw its troops by September this year, at the 
same time it demands normal living conditions for military 
pensioners who wish to stay and live in Estonia. 
  Commenting on the present situation, Estonian Foreign 
Minister Juri Luik noted that Russia does not yet accept Estonia 
as an equal partner. The concern of Tallinn politicians is 
understandable since Russia, even after the withdrawal of its 
troops, will still have a powerful weapon to influence Estonia's 
policies -- the almost half a million strong Russian-speaking 
community that has not yet received Estonian citizenship and is, 
therefore, under Russia's particular attention. 
  So, although the talks are not justifying the hopes, it is 
not worth breaking them off either, the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry considers.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Juri Luik has commented on Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's interview to the [word 
indistinct] NEWSWEEK weekly. [Words indistinct] With the 
Helsinki Final Act, Russia took upon herself an unambiguous 
obligation to withdraw her troops from Estonia quickly, in an 
orderly manner and completely. The UN General Assembly and CSCE 
foreign ministers have been demanding the same of Russia. 
Keeping in mind such a consensus on the part of the world 
public, each Russian hint which casts doubt on the withdrawal of 
the Russian troops must be seen as violating crudely the 
international behavior standards, said Juri Luik. The Russian 
foreign minister's hint that the Western countries' request for 
Russia to observe elementary standards of international 
communication and honor unconditionally the sovereignty of her 
neighboring countries would (?play a trump card) into [Vladimir] 
Zhirinovskiy's hands remains completely unclear to the 
[Estonian] foreign minister. Against this background, Juri Luik 
recalls with worry that despite previous promises Russia failed 
to hand over to Estonia a timetable for the troop withdrawal 
during the recently ended 16th round of talks and not one 
Russian serviceman left Estonia in January.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 08, BNS -- Estonia on Friday [4 
February] initiated criminal proceedings against Pyotr Rozhok, 
the representative of Russia's radical nationalist Liberal 
Democratic Party in Estonia. 
  Charges were brought under Article 72 of the criminal code, 
the minister of population, Peeter Olesk, said. 
  Olesk told a BNS correspondent that Rozhok now cannot be 
deported from the country -- and that there is no reason to do 
so -- before the case is brought to a conclusion. 
  The issue also stood on the agenda of today's meeting of the 
Cabinet of Ministers. The Cabinet heard the opinion of Interior 
Minister Heiki Arike on the issue. 
  The director general of the Defense Police, Juri Pihl, said 
it was his department that had initiated the criminal case. "He 
has not been arrested so far," Pihl said. 
  Rozhok in an interview with BNS at about 4 p.m. today said 
he knew nothing of the charges brought against him. He said he 
had no contacts with the security police recently. 
  The representative of Zhirinovskiy's party in Estonia said 
he 
had no intention to leave the country. "But why?" he asked, 
explaining that he is living on a territory that is Russia's 
domain for ages. 
  Vasili Ostapchuk, adviser at the Russian Embassy in Tallinn, 
said Rozhok had not turned to the embassy for help. "If Rozhok 
appeals to us for help, we can act under the consular convention 
and the legal assistance agreement," he said. 
  The criminal code's Article 72 foresees punishments ranging 
from fines to one year in prison for activity aimed at 
instigating ethnic, racial or religious hostility. 
  Rozhok in his public statements on several occasions has 
expressed views hostile toward Estonia. In an interview with 
the SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK newspaper of the northeast Estonian town 
of Sillamae last month he called on Russian army veterans to 
form paramilitary units "for defending the (Russians') honor and 
dignity" and again claimed Estonia was Russia's traditional 
domain. 
  Rozhok is legally a citizen of Russia since May 28, 1992.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 08, BNS -- Some of the consignments of 
cartridges that arrived in Estonia under the country's arms 
purchase deal with Israel are not in full keeping with the 
demands set in the agreement, Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar 
said in a press conference today. 
  Laar said Estonia had delivered its notification to Israel 
and the issue is to be settled soon. 
  "The arms purchase agreement is a detailed one and ensures 
full control of the arms that are arriving," he explained. 
  The head of Estonia's Central Staff, Colonel Ants Laaneots, 
at a meeting with the chairman of the Committee of Directors of 
Israel's military industries, General Dan Shomron on Monday [7 
February] delivered his department's claims regarding the 
completeness of the weapons consignment. 
  The prime minister in his remarks indicated there was no 
connection between the additional arms given by Israel as gift 
to Estonia and "possible irregularities" in fulfilling the arms 
deal. Israel granted to Estonia a consignment of older 
Soviet-made trophy weapons. 
  "Estonia's arms purchase was a very successful one, and in 
addition were given a gift. Surely we will also in the future 
consider the possibility of complementing our supply of arms and 
technical equipment with the help of Israel. For the time being 
we must determine our defense concept and make clear what kind 
of army and weapons we need," Laar told BNS. 
  He said Israel offered a wide variety of military equipment, 
including border guarding technologies.

  [Text] Tallin, Feb 08 (BNS) -- Russian naval ships on Jan. 
26 carried 48 seamines of newer types from the island of 
Naissaar in the Bay of Tallinn to the Russian navy's Lomonosov 
base in the Leningrad region. 
  According to information obtained by BNS, there are no more 
newer-type seamines in the Naissaar base. Russia now continues 
destroying its supply of older types of mines by burining them 
on the island. The Naissaar base as recently as Dec. 1, 1993 
was reported to have a stock of some 1,280 seamines, including 
80 of the newer types. 
  Estonian authorities until now don't know the exact number 
of 
Russian military staying in the country. Sources in the Central 
Staff of the Estonian defense forces said different estimates 
put the number at 2,700-3,000. 
  There has been no remarkable movement of Russian military 
from the country in January, neither have any major changes 
taken place in the structure of the Russian units still 
stationed in Estonia. Some technical equipment, however, has 
been taken out, officials said. 
  Russia's chief negotiator for talks with Estonia, Vasili 
Svirin, in early December said his country had about 
2,600-strong military presence in Estonia. 
  Reports by the 2nd department of the Estonian Central Staff 
say Russian naval forces account for about 1,100-1,200 of the 
remaining troops. About 300-400 are still present in different 
kinds of auxiliary units and supply depots. Some 500 Russian 
officers and noncommissioned officers whose units have left the 
Estonian territory are also staying in the country. 
  Russian units of any remarkable size are stationed only in 
Tallinn and the surrounding Harju region.

  [Text] The Latvian Foreign Ministry issued a statement 
today concerning the claims made by Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev in an interview with the U.S. journal NEWSWEEK. 
As the Foreign Ministry statement says, in the interview 
Kozyrev reported that Latvia is attempting to deport thousands 
of people to Russia, which he called ethnic cleansing. In this 
connection, the Latvian Foreign Ministry states that these 
claims are baseless. The Latvian Government, reacting to 
statements of this kind from Russian officials, has repeatedly 
pointed out that allegations of ethnic cleansing do not 
correspond to the truth, the document emphasizes. The Latvian 
Foreign Ministry believes that the attitude expressed by the 
Russian Foreign Ministry proves that senior Russian officials 
are blatantly ignoring the conclusions of international 
institutions at several levels regarding the real human rights 
situation in Latvia.

  [Text] And now let us look at yesterday's news conference, 
because a very important issue for Latvia was discussed there. 
  Because at the end of the day, the withdrawal of the Russian 
Army from Skrunda and the dismantling of the Skrunda radar 
station are currently the most topical issues for Latvian 
security policy. The government is currently working on Latvian 
stance at talks with our eastern neighboring state and on the 
signing of corresponding agreements. And Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs is reporting about that. 
  [Begin Birkavs recording] Now it has become more or less 
clear to everyone that security is really the number one 
priority for Latvia and I would say for the whole Baltics. 
Taking into account that the talks with Russia are entering the 
decisive phase, I think that we have to give a wide and complete 
idea of what will happen if we conclude the agreement and what 
will happen if we do not conclude the agreement. 
  Latvia has to conclude an agreement with Russia on possibly 
earlier troop withdrawal and the deadline is 31 August. Skrunda 
is to be left here for four years and 18 months. With our 
strong stance not to yield, we have practically secured very 
stable support for Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania from American 
and European states and a guarantee that they will support us 
and that they will bolster us, but this agreement has to be 
concluded. These signals which come from other countries of the 
world. They will considerably intensify in the future, as soon 
as the agreement is concluded and they will become particularly 
active after the 31st when there will be no [Russian] Army here. 
[end recording] 
  However, as the experience shows, agreements concluded with 
Russia do not at all mean that they will be really complied with 
and Valdis Birkavs is continuing about possible guarantees in 
such case. 
  [Begin Birkavs recording] We wish to begin the dismantling 
[of the Skrunda radar] much sooner and I hope that we will 
succeed in it. However, while it is worked on -- and the 
Russian side, at least at the previous talks, agreed -- we will 
also work on a corresponding security mechanism, which means 
that the system of international security guarantees would come 
into effect in the event that the agreement is not complied 
with. [end recording] 
  This is an excerpt from yesterday's press conference, at 
which Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs was speaking.

  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS - Russia can operate a radar 
station in Skrunda, Latvia, for another four years, under a 
package of documents prepared for signing by a recent round of 
the Russian-Latvian state negotiations on Russian troops 
withdrawal from Latvia, Russian delegation head Sergey Zotov 
told a briefing here today. The station will enjoy additional 18 
months for dismantling. 
  The sides discussed the main agreement on troops withdrawal 
and agreements on social protection of servicemen and military 
pensioners, as well as the legal status and conditions of the 
radar station functioning. 
  "We have only technical issues left. Their immediate 
solution will give way to the finalization of the whole package 
of agreements to be submitted to the Russian and Lithuanian [as 
received] governments for signing," said Zotov. 
  Zotov said the Russian Government may receive the agreements 
by the end of this month.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igoro Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a letter to Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis which expresses confidence that Latvia 
will not view the agreement with Russia on the schedule and 
terms of the temporary use of Russia's radar in Skrunda as 
"humiliating or imposed," the Latvian president's office 
announced. 
  IF Note: During talks in Moscow on Monday, the Latvian and 
Russian delegations came to an agreement that the radar would 
function over the next four years and would be dismantled during 
the 18 months following the expiration of that term. 
  If Latvia accepts these terms, Russia will remove its troops 
from Latvia by August 31, 1994. Earlier, Russia had intended to 
use it over the next five years. Latvia insisted on three years 
plus one more year for the dismantling of the radar. 
  During a Latvian governmental delegation's visit to 
Washington last week, U.S. secretary of State Warren Christopher 
recommended that Latvia and Russia come to terms on the 
temporary use of the radar in the village of Skrunda. 
  Clinton wrote in his letter that a compromise would be the 
best solution, as it will ensure the Russian troops' withdrawal 
this year. 
  He also expressed confidence that the work done during the 
Latvian delegation's visit to Washington had ensured progress in 
the Latvian-Russian talks and helped improve relations between 
these two states.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 8 Feb -- The Russian Federation 
Communications Union has warned the government and TV companies 
that "it will black out all TV programs except the morning and 
evening newscasts put out by Ostankino and the All-Russian State 
TV and Radio Broadcasting Company" from 10 February onwards. 
The blackout will continue until the state TV and radio 
companies pay all the debts they owe TV and radio transmission 
enterprises for 1993 and January 1994. The threat was contained 
in a statement issued today by the coordinating committee of 
workers employed at TV and radio transmitters in the Russian 
Federation. The statement has been sent to Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
chairman of the Russian government, to the Ostankino management, 
and to Russia's Communications Ministry. 
  The statement says this ultimatum is justified because the 
extremely acute financial crisis at transmission stations 
relaying state radio and TV programs has still not been 
resolved. The Finance Ministry has not settled debts owed to 
communications enterprises. Radio stations in Kamchatka, 
Kaliningrad, and other towns have already been silenced because 
transmitter stations cannot pay for electricity and other 
supplies. The majority of communications enterprises in Russia 
are on the brink of grinding to a halt. 
  The statement says, however, that the coordinating committee 
"considers it essential to maintain the intercity telephone 
network and to ensure that public information can still be 
broadcast, especially in emergencies."

  [Excerpts] Russian communications workers are threatening 
to limit transmissions on Ostankino TV and All-Russian State 
Radio and Television Company to morning and evening news 
programs starting 10 February. [passage omitted] 
  We have learned that Aleksandr Yakovlev, head of the Federal 
Television and Radio Broadcasting Service, has called a meeting 
of representatives on all sides to look for a solution following 
the ultimatum from communications workers. The meeting adopted 
a letter to the prime minister, stressing that allocation of 
money to clear the debts to the communications workers is a 
political more than an economic necessity. People should have 
access to news regardless, and the government should fulfill its 
obligations to the Communications Ministry and to state 
television and radio companies.

<F P=106> [By correspondent E. Guretskaya, including recording of </F>
remarks by Russian Television Director Oleg Popstov and an 
unidentified TV viewer; from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Announcer] We have received a statement of the 
central committee of the Union of Communications Workers of 
Russia saying that from 10 February the Ministry of 
Communications can only guarantee the broadcasting of the news 
programs of Ostankino and Russia's Television, and that only in 
the morning and in the evening. 
  [Guretskaya] The first reaction of an ordinary TV viewer, a 
man in the street, to the prospect of facing a blank television 
screen was this: 
  [Unidentified speaker] They are just hooligans, I think this 
is absolutely outrageous! 
  [Guretskaya] Here is a reaction to the same by a 
professional, the chief of one of the state television companies. 
  [Poptsov] I think this is a natural action, a normal step to 
take, and it should not be called blackmail. This is not 
blackmail, this is a forced measure. Please understand: This 
is a cry, an appeal for help. 
  [Guretskaya] Last year the heads of the Communications 
Ministry, not without help from the heads of the TV and radio 
companies, prevented a general strike of communications workers 
eight times. But all things in this world of ours are 
interrelated: We owe money to communications workers, they in 
turn to people in power engineering while the government owes 
money to them all. Everyone has turned out to be a bankrupt. 
  [Poptsov] Why do we have no budget? Because people don't pay 
taxes. There are no funds to make up a budget. Taxes are not 
being paid because the tax system is not functioning. The 
government which is unable to guarantee the implementation of 
its own decisions in fact dooms the very concept of statehood 
and legality to failure. 
  [Guretskaya] Oleg Poptsov has pointed out correctly that 
what 
the reactionary forces failed to achieve during the night of 3-4 
October 1993 -- they failed to make TV screens go blank -- can 
now be done without any great shocks. You simply stop paying 
money, and the screens go blank of themselves. Thus money -- 
or, rather, the lack of it -- is the cause of everything. Or 
maybe there is another cause? 
  [Poptsov] I am deeply convinced that there is a powerful 
lobby behind the idea of the shortening of broadcasting time. 
This force, acting behind the government's back, wants the 
state broadcasting reduced in order to get free space for 
themselves and wants the state to reduce and finally lose its 
interest in TV and radio broadcasting. Then some very different 
forces can enter that area and then, I am sorry to say, the 
state, the government, the president and the Duma will lose 
control of this country called the Russian Federation -- or 
simply of Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the Russian </F>
Government apparatus, by Ruslan Ignatyev under the rubric "Only 
in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA"; place and date not given: "Who Signed 
the Government Decision on Journalists"] 
  [Text] For almost a week now the newspapers, radio, and 
television have been commenting on the government decision 
restricting access to presidium sessions for journalists other 
than correspondents of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and ITAR-TASS. 
  It has also been reported that the leadership has revised 
its 
directive, however, and that the range of accredited 
publications has been enlarged. 
  Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent asked Vladimir 
Kvasov, leader of the Russian Federation Government apparatus, 
for an explanation. 
  [Ignatyev] Vladimir Petrovich, can we clarify matters here 
-- did the government make the decision to which the mass media 
are alluding and, if so, who signed it? 
  [Kvasov] The government has not arrived at any decision or 
directive, even less a decree, which says that journalists are 
barred from attending presidium sessions. As a rule such 
questions are resolved in the course of work. There is no need 
for the corresponding documents on this score, and therefore 
there can be no signatures by members of the government. But 
statements of the type that the government has revised its 
decision are just insinuation. 
  [Ignatyev] Nevertheless, as we have already reported, such 
an order has come from you personally. A representative of the 
government press service told an ITAR-TASS correspondent about 
this. You then confirmed this fact for us. Has anything 
changed since then? 
  [Kvasov] No. I can repeat now that I gave only a verbal 
instruction that the system of journalists' accreditation should 
be regulated. The need for this arose when the government moved 
to its new address. The move caused a certain confusion for the 
work of a number of our services. As a result, people we did 
not know and complete outsiders began turning up to presidium 
sessions. The press published materials describing not the 
essentials of the presidium's work but mere intrigue. 
Furthermore, questions were assessed even though they were 
still at the discussion stage and decisions had not been made on 
them at the time. 
  [Ignatyev] Did such materials harm the government's work? 
  [Kvasov] These publications disinformed society, 
destabilized the situation in the country, and cast the 
government in an unfavorable light. A presidium session cannot 
be a public spectacle. And the presence of journalists, 
especially in large number, objectively introduces an element of 
theater to the proceedings. Normal and constructive work 
requires the appropriate conditions. Sometimes, however, a 
casual phrase uttered by someone at a presidium session is blown 
up into a real sensation in the press. This is why we want to 
instill proper order here. There is nothing scandalous about it. 
  [Ignatyev] But why were Russian Television [RTV] reporters 
not allowed into Government House last Saturday? 
  [Kvasov] I should think that, before guests come to visit 
you, they inform you first. That is the usual way of things 
everywhere. But to turn up without an invitation and then 
hammer on a locked door is stupid to say the least. Then to 
tell the whole country that journalists cannot get into the 
White House is tantamount to self-criticism and an admission of 
one's own helplessness. But to deal with specifics, the report 
on this subject in the Vesti newscast is typical first and 
foremost of the RTV leadership's work, namely, its inability to 
reach agreement with the relevant agencies on obtaining the 
necessary permission for filming. There is a definite procedure 
for this established in our country, just as there is in other 
civilized countries. It must be adhered to. For example, just 
you try to get into a British Government session without an 
invitation and see what happens. 
  [Ignatyev] As far as is known, the government was at work on 
Saturday and discussed some serious issues.... 
  [Kvasov] Yes, the government did work Saturday. However, no 
questions requiring urgent and broad coverage in the mass media 
were examined. Admittedly, that is my view. But if journalists 
consider it necessary to report on this or that problem they can 
get all the necessary materials and commentaries from our press 
service. 
  [Ignatyev] Does your restriction on the presence of 
representatives of certain publications, news agencies, and 
television at government sessions not contravene the Law on the 
Mass Media? 
  [Kvasov] I would remind you once again that there is no ban. 
In response to new applications from this or that publication, 
agency, or radio and television editorial office, lists will be 
compiled and journalists will be accredited accordingly. But it 
is not our intention to admit or bar particular correspondents. 
In other words, this is not a question of the right to obtain 
information but of the mechanism whereby that information is 
obtained. The Russian Federation Government's press service, 
headed by Valentin Mikhaylovich Sergeyev, deals with the work of 
that mechanism. How that service works is another question. 
Clearly we must investigate this properly. And is it not clear 
why the government press service did not grant the relevant 
materials to RTV when it came to Government House Saturday? 
Well, that question is probably one for us to deal with. I 
believe we will be able to answer it in the near future.

  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- Leader of the Russia's 
Choice State Duma faction Yegor Gaydar urged today Russian 
democratic and reform organizations to pull their efforts in the 
upcoming local elections. Otherwise the spring elections may 
result in the revival of camouflaged Soviets, says Gaydar's 
statement. 
  In the opinion of Gaydar, it is necessary to elaborate a 
joint strategy for the election campaign in the next two or 
three weeks. 
  It would be good to agree on the following principle: one 
candidate of all democratic and reform forces to one mandate, he 
said. Gaydar also suggested an agreement on quotas for each 
regional reform organization as pre-election tactics. The 
quotas can be based on the electors' support to democratic 
electoral coalitions in regions. The principle can be made 
all-Russian and then specified at joint consultations. 
  Gaydar is ready to insist on quotas in favor of new 
progressive trade unions, business and workers' organizations 
and independent professional candidates.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- Gleb Yakunin, deputy of 
Russia's State Duma, who is a member of the "Russia's Choice" 
faction and co-chairman of the "Democratic Russia" popular 
movement, spoke at length about the situation inside the faction 
to ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  Yakunin described the situation inside "Russia's Choice" as 
generally normal. According to him, the faction is unlikely to 
split, even though its members differ in their stand both toward 
the Russian Government and the possibility of the bloc's 
transformation into a political party. 
  He deems it inevitable that the bloc should re-evaluate its 
values in view of its defeat at the December elections. 
  A number of the bloc's members would like to form a rigid 
party led by Yegor Gaydar, whereas their opponents inside the 
bloc would rather form a broader popular anti-fascist, 
anti-totalitarian movement based on "Russia's Choice" and 
"Democratic Russia". 
  "Democratic Russia" is to decide on the issue at the session 
of the council of representatives on February 25-26 and then at 
the forthcoming congress of the movement. 
  Personally, Yakunin does not approve of the idea to form a 
political party, because he thinks it impossible to produce a 
larger party than the Party of Russian Unity and Accord or the 
Russian Movement of Democratic Reforms. 
  He was also critical of the idea to create a "presidential" 
party. According to him, it would be impossible for the 
president to form a party without involving the nomenklatura or 
the Soviet-style privileged establishment, which is celebrating 
its victory these days. 
  Such a party could be worse than the Communist Party of the 
Soviet Union, he said. 
  Both "Russia's Choice" and "Democratic Russia" direct their 
activities at preparations for the 1996 elections, he said. 
  As to the forthcoming elections to the local governments, 
"Russia's Choice" has in fact too little time to make due 
preparations. We cannot but ignore insignificant programme 
differences and we call on all the democrats to join together, 
he said. 
  Touching on his faction's stand toward the government, 
Yakunin remarked that the representatives of "Democratic Russia" 
were still taking a very tough stand, although the two political 
allies seemed so far to share the general principle: to support 
positive initiatives of the government while remaining in 
opposition to it. 
  According to Yakunin, Yegor Gaydar takes a more restrained 
stand, though he also criticizes the government. 
  In Yakunin's opinion, it is unlikely that the "Russia's 
Choice" faction should split for this reason: The faction 
cannot afford such a "luxury" in view of the difficult political 
situation.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report in the "Party Building" column: "The </F>
President Will Soon Have His Own Party. It Will Advocate 
`Moderate Reformist' Positions"] 
  [Text] Each political crisis in Russia over the past few 
years has invariably been accompanied by rumors, talk and 
"fairly authoritative" statements about the creation of a 
certain pro-reform "super-party" led by Boris Yeltsin. 
Moreover, the president himself has repeatedly stressed the 
need for forming such a structure. As a rule, things did not 
move beyond the talking stage. Now, however, rumors about a 
"presidential party" seem to be materializing. 
  The formation of the "super-party" will be the concern of 
regional "committees in support of the Russian Federation's 
first president," advocating "moderate reformist-democratic 
positions," and structures of the President Foundation led by 
well-known democratic movement activist Lev Shemayev. No doubt, 
the president's administration and some executive power 
structures will also make a contribution to creating a 
presidential party. According to Nikolay Medvedev, chief of the 
Russian Federation presidential administration's Directorate for 
Liaison with the Territories, some time at the end of February 
the groups taking the initiative on founding a presidential 
party will hold their first meeting in Samara. It will be 
attended by representatives from Samara, Ulyanovsk, Saratov, 
Penza, Volgograd, Ryazan, and Moscow. In particular one of the 
delegates from the Moscow branch will be the president's 
representative in Moscow, Vladimir Kamchatov, who was 
unsuccessful in contesting a seat in the Federation Council. In 
Shemayev's opinion, the Samara conference will become the first 
stage in the formation of grass-roots structures of the 
presidential party. 
  According to Shemayev, the main task of the future party is 
to look for an idea capable of rallying all the healthy forces 
in Russia. This idea will serve as a basis for the party 
program, while the program itself is most likely to be of an 
economic rather than political character, presenting a concept 
for the country's economic development for the next 10 to 15 
years. 
  It is expected that along with rank and file members, 
representatives of the enterprise directors corps and of banking 
and commercial structures will also join the party. Medvedev 
did not rule out that the centrist-minded members of 
democratically oriented parties and movements, including 
Russia's Choice, may "insist that their programs be adjusted in 
line with the current political and economic realities," as a 
result of which part of the pro-reform association participants 
may affiliate with the presidential party. At the same time Lev 
Shemayev said he doubted that such politicians as Gennadiy 
Burbulis, Sergey Shakhray, or Arkadiy Volskiy will have anything 
to do with the leadership of the future super-party. 
  According to Lev Shemayev, the emerging party is going to 
nominate Boris Yeltsin as candidate in the next presidential 
elections. 
  The leadership of the majority of democratic parties and 
movements has so far not reacted in any way to the possible 
appearance of a presidential party. Meanwhile Sergey Shakhray, 
chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, noted that 
the only way to ensure the speedy creation of the presidential 
party is to organize the entire vertical executive structure as 
a party structure. According to Shakhray, such a course of 
events can lead to "purges" in the state apparatus and a 
weakened executive branch.

<F P=106> [Olga Garbuzova report: "Sergey Shakhray Press Conference. </F>
Minister Announces Creation of Pro-Government Coalition"] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord, minister for nationalities and regional policy 
affairs, intends to create, on the basis of his party, a 
centrist coalition to form firm support for Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's government. That the creation of such a 
conservative association was necessary was stated by Shakhray at 
a meeting of representatives of regional organizations of his 
party on 5 February. The creation of the new political 
structure has already begun. Yesterday, Sergey Shakhray held 
first talks on this topic with leaders of the Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions of Russia. 
  In the wake of radical democrats' actually having joined the 
opposition to the present government, the Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord, led by two ministers -- Sergey Shakhray and 
Aleksandr Shokhin -- became a loyal ally of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's cabinet. The political weight of this party in 
the present parliament, however, is not too great. Its faction 
currently is made up of as little as some 30 deputies -- all 
members of the party at that. The New Regional Policy faction 
is the main political ally of Shakhray's party in parliament, 
but so far they have not fully agreed to coordinating their 
positions. 
  Still, Shakhray does not seem to have given up hope that it 
would soon be possible to create a coalition of 110 to 130 State 
Duma deputies, including members of the Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord faction, to form a reliable support for the present 
government. At any rate, this was what Sergey Shakhray declared 
on Saturday at the meeting with representatives of his party's 
regional organizations. 
  To all appearances, Sergey Shakhray intends to form the 
pro-government coalition at a rapid pace both inside and outside 
the parliament. Already yesterday, these questions were 
discussed in his meeting with chiefs of the Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions of Russia. This haste is quite 
understandable. Indeed, some leaders of Russia's Choice -- 
Mikhail Poltoranin, for example -- are on record as having 
stated that the fall of the current government is a matter of 
months. Last week's meeting of the Democratic Russia 
coordination council discussed the possibility of holding mass 
actions to demand the resignation of Chernomyrdin's cabinet. 
  The key task of the new centrist entity is supposed to be to 
avert the threat, in the coming spring, of yet another political 
crisis. Meeting representatives of his party's regional 
branches, Shakhray issued a warning that by spring the readiness 
to strike in many regions would create a political background 
that would cause a sharper crisis in the government and the 
State Duma. 
  On the other hand, Shakhray thinks, there may develop a 
political confrontation between the State Duma and the president 
which would most likely pick up depending on the decisions and 
laws made by the Duma. All these factors, as well as the 
"interethnic situation," Shakhray thinks, are going to create a 
"cumulative effect" in May. It is for this reason that the new 
centrist pro-government bloc should take final organizational 
shape by that time.

in Gorkiy-1994. An Administrative Reform in the Kremlin: All 
Information Provision Departments Will Be Abolished"] 
  [Text] While observers' attention is centered on the 
ongoing reorganization of the government and the replacement of 
"shock monetary" reforms by "non-shock and non-monetary" ones, 
the gradual reorganization of presidential structures is 
successfully and inconspicuously coming to an end. According to 
information in possession of SEGODNYA, a corresponding 
presidential edict may be signed before the end this week. 
  The latest variant for the organization of these structures 
to be approved by the edict bears the obvious marks of 
behind-the-scenes struggle. The new scheme for the presidential 
structure enshrines the effective exclusion of the power 
ministries and the Foreign Affairs Ministry from the government 
and their inclusion into the presidential administration. 
Furthermore, its most characteristic feature is the emergence 
of a "dual power" situation within the presidential 
administration: Viktor Ilyushin, the president's first aide, is 
equated in his "weight category" with the figure of the 
presidential administration chief. Consequently, the first 
aide, who in the new hierarchy is above the Security Council 
secretary and power ministers, emerges from a formally secondary 
figure into a full-fledged official. 
  The presidential structures plan originally envisioned that 
the Analytical Center, the president's business management, the 
State Legal Directorate, and the Oversight Directorate would 
pass under the control of his first aide. The administration 
chief's jurisdiction was to include the remaining "vital" 
services, such as departments within presidential commissions, 
departments on matters of citizenship, state awards, pardons, 
and so forth. 
  The latest version of the plan features a number of minor 
but 
-- from the inner-party viewpoint -- extremely important 
provisions. Separation of powers in the administration 
leadership has not been delineated so clearly as in the past 
(which leaves room for apparatus improvisations). Furthermore, 
the new plan has obviously reflected the results of 
behind-the-scenes bargaining between the administration and the 
president's first aide. 
  The new version does not provide for the president's 
national 
security adviser -- a relatively independent post currently 
occupied by Yuriy Baturin. Presidential regional 
representatives have been moved from the jurisdiction of the 
administration chief "under the first aide." The leadership of 
the State Legal Directorate and the Oversight Directorate has 
been formally removed from the control of the first aide and 
placed under the president: the question about their 
jurisdiction has therefore been left open. And finally, the 
Information Resources Directorate (IRD) has been abolished 
within the presidential administration while its remains are to 
be transferred to the Federal Government Communication and 
Information Agency under the president (FGCIA). 
  After a year and a half in the shadows, Viktor Ilyushin 
officially legitimates his first role in the president's 
entourage. This is not only a matter of a clash of personal 
ambitions by the first aide and the presidential administration 
chief, who does not have such close contacts with the apparatus, 
but a tough political struggle under the table. 
  The direction and meaning of this struggle are reflected 
most conspicuously in the fact that FGCIA (a former government 
communications committee under the USSR KGB) has successfully 
"swallowed" the last relatively independent information 
provision service in the presidential structures -- the 
Information Resources Directorate. The easy and generally 
accessible information channels created by IRD allowed the 
presidential team to establish effective interaction with the 
regions during the crises in August 1991 and in April and 
September 1993. This was especially important in the situation 
when some former KGB generals who came to head the "renewed" 
federal agencies showed a propensity for "falling sick" on 21 
September, "getting lost" immediately after the order arrived on 
disconnecting communication channels in the White House, and 
playing a double game with Rutskoy and Khasbulatov till the last 
moment. 
  FGCIA has taken repeated steps to assume control of the 
entire "policy in the information provision sphere" in Russia. 
As of the moment IRD is abolished, FGCIA -- a former 
specialized subdivision of the secret police designed to ensure 
confidential communication channels (the "hot line" and so 
forth) -- officially takes control of information provision, 
including open information channels of all state structures: 
the Federal Assembly, the government, and the presidential 
administration. The secret police information services did not 
enjoy such powers even in the Soviet period, when they could so 
easily disconnect the USSR president from running the country. 
  According to some sources, the backstage changes in the 
presidential circles reflect the general trend: After two years 
of painstaking work to overcome the undesirable consequences of 
the August 1991 events, the "underground Sverdlovsk [Yeltsin's 
home base] Obkom" in the Kremlin, in close contact with the 
"underground Gazprom" in the White House and other such like 
structures, is finally restoring both informational-political 
and organizational control over Russia's top state leadership. 
Invaluable assistance in this undertaking is coming from the 
still intact "democratic administrators": Against the 
background of their get-together in the Kremlin, the 
"obkomists'" teamwork and cohesion produces a particularly 
strong impression and leads to especially effective results. 
According to a source, the best analogue for the incumbent 
democratic leadership in the presidential administration is the 
White Rabbit and his administrative team in the entourage of the 
Queen from Alice in Wonderland. Frenetic activity with zero (if 
not negative) effect may help forget for a while that what is 
happening is a mere deck of cards being reshuffled by quite 
other players. 
  The mechanism for making major decisions by the president is 
rather peculiar because it envisions the possibility of making 
last- minute adjustments, from slightly changing the essence of 
the decisions made to reversing them. Therefore the impending 
comprehensive informational-political and organizational 
isolation of the president by his apparatus is rather 
reminiscent not of Foros-'91, but Gorkiy-'23 [Lenin's last 
retreat].

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Savelyev, All-Russian Center for the Study </F>
of Public Opinion sociologist, under the "Sociology" rubric: 
"Another Election on the Way"] 
  [Text] In a survey conducted by the All-Russia Center for 
the Study of Public Opinion in the second half of January, 
approximately 1,600 adult urban residents of the Russian 
Federation answered the question: "With the upcoming elections 
for local bodies of power, whom are you going to vote for in 
these elections: democrats, communists, Agrarian Party 
representatives, V. Zhirinovskiy's party, or some others?" The 
answers in percentage points are as follows: 
  Democrats -- 26 
  Communists -- 8 
  Agrarian Party -- 6 
  Zhirinovskiy's party -- 9 
  An independent candidate --12 
  Someone else -- 5 
  Not going to vote -- 14 
  Hard to say -- 20 
  Those going to vote for democrats are, more often than not, 
entrepreneurs, managers of various ranks, specialists, students, 
and men generally, persons below 40 with a secondary and higher 
education, with an income per one member of the family of more 
than 48,000 rubles a month, and those who voted for Russia's 
Choice, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and the 
Democratic Party of Russia. 
  Those who want to elect communists, more than others, to 
local bodies of power are executives, pensioners, and generally 
women, persons above 50 with a per capita income of less than 
30,000 a month, and those who voted for the Russian Federation 
Communist Party. 
  Those wishing to vote for representatives of the Agrarian 
Party are mostly pensioners, workers and men generally, persons 
of above 55 with an education of less than secondary and an 
income of 30-45,000 rubles who voted for the Agrarian Party and 
the Yavlinskiy bloc. 
  Those going to vote for Zhirinovskiy's party candidates are 
most often military men and militiamen, workers, men on the 
whole, persons below 25, and between 40 and 54 years of age with 
an education of less than secondary and an income of less than 
30,000 and of more than 65,000 rubles, who already voted for 
this party on 12 December. 
  Those who prefer to vote for independent candidates are more 
often than not specialists, executives, and generally persons 
between 25 and 39 years of age with a higher education and an 
income of more than 65,000 rubles, and who voted for the Women 
of Russia and for the Yavlinskiy bloc. 
  Those who are not going to the elections for local 
authorities are mostly military men and militiamen, students, 
the unemployed, and those polled of under 25 years of age and 
with an education of less than secondary and an income of up to 
30,000 rubles, and those who did not go to the last polls, or 
who voted "against everyone."

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has 
strongly rejected accusations that his government is abandoning 
its policy of reform. 
  "From the storm and stress of the first few years of 
reforms, 
we are going over to more thorough constructive work, which 
involves deeper structures and institutions of the economy. The 
government should be up to this work, and therefore it has taken 
a somewhat new form," Chernomyrdin said at a meeting in the 
Interior Ministry on Tuesday. 
  "The president's policy of deep-going democratic reforms in 
Russian society, in its economy and political institutions will 
be continued and will be aimed at meeting the strategic 
interests of Russia," the prime minister said. He said only the 
president and Constitution, not any of the present or former 
members of government, were guarantors of the reforms, which 
meant the demands for the revision of that policy were aimed 
against the president rather than the government, he said. 
  "I am proud that I come from the `Red' enterprise managers. 
What is really bad is that those who are now seeking power have 
no experience and would run experiments on the whole country," 
Chernomyrdin said to the stormy applause of his listeners. 
  He admitted that the previous month had been marked by a new 
serious bout of inflation. He said inflation and the present 
grave financial situation were the number-one problem for the 
government, which would focus on "a reasonably tough policy of 
financial stabilization and measures to curb inflation as much 
as possible." 
  The premier said the government would tightly control 
budgetary expenditures this year. "Most of the promises will be 
kept," and the government is determined to pay all its debts for 
1993, he said. "The people will understand that we finally have 
to live within our means. The government will no longer deceive 
or delude anyone," he said.

  [Text] The Russian government's spokesman told Interfax 
that Andrey Illarionov was removed from the post of head of the 
government's group for analysis and planning by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin on February 7 for violating labor discipline. 
  The government's personnel department stated that from 
January 17 to 20 Illarionov did not report to work and that he 
refused to give any explanations. It turned out that during 
that time he was giving lectures in Britain without informing 
the government about this. 
  Illarionov's statement that he resigned because he did not 
support the government's policies was an attempt to conceal the 
real cause of his dismissal, said the government's spokesman.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- Georgiy Satarov, appointed 
presidential aide here today, is taking office not at a time 
when he could be congratulated on his new job. He will be faced 
with the far from easy task of promoting "on behalf of the 
president" proper interaction among the chambers and factions of 
the new Russian parliament, which has already proved to be an 
independent political force. 
  As a matter of fact, the 46-year-old scholar has sufficient 
experience in dealing with political leaders of different 
leanings. As director of the Russian Socio-Political Centre, he 
was able to find common language with the Communists, with 
Baburin's Russian National Union, with Nikolay Travkin's party, 
whose headquarters are under the centre's roof. 
  The "naturalistic-experimental interest" of this scientist, 
who is, moreover, a member of the Presidential Council, in all 
the "sectors" of the political spectrum was not always 
adequately received within President Yeltsin's administration. 
This is why Satarov had to publicly explain that the state was 
interested in interaction with all the political parties and 
movements, because they represent a channel for promoting a 
dialogue between the authorities and the society. 
  Being concurrently director-general of the Centre for 
Applied 
Political Studies -- Indem (Informations for Democracy), 
Candidate of Technical Sciences Georgiy Satarov has also proved 
to be a remarkable sociologist. His scientific works on the 
balance of political forces within the Congress of People's 
Deputies of the former Russian Supreme Soviet, which were 
repeatedly published in the magazine "Russian Monitor", give 
reason to assert that Satarov will apparently display an equally 
correct approach to the forecasting and analysis of the current 
parliament's work. 
  It is indicative that the president is gradually giving up 
the practice of inviting politically engaged people, who, while 
at the helm of power, cared mostly for their own career, but 
began to oppose Yeltsin the very minute they were deprived of 
it. Satarov's appointment as presidential aide (new decrees are 
expected to be issued to include in the presidential 
administration other members of the Presidential Council from 
among independent scientists) differs positively also from the 
latest personnel changes within the government. 
  President Yeltsin publicly stated last year that he would 
"fire" Satarov for disagreeing with the timing of the next 
presidential elections. The ideas of this member of the 
Presidential Council, which proved necessary during the 
compilation of the new Russian constitution and during the 
preparation of the presidential message to the parliament, have 
apparently "outweighed" the president's erstwhile anger, and one 
more outstanding personality was added to the group of the 
presidential aides.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader </F>
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Marianne Sajdik; place and date not 
given: "They Can Eat Their Dumplings in the Dark"] 
  [Text] [Sajdik] How would you describe the current 
situation in Russia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I can see the situation in Russia only in a 
positive light: Ahead of us are the end of the crisis and the 
renaissance of Russia. The reformers have declared their 
bankruptcy, which is unpleasant for the West. Our policy is 
based on the equality of all forms of ownership, state or 
private. We would change the tax system in favor of the 
producers. We will end state and criminal blackmailing. We 
will reconstruct economic relations with the regions and end the 
war in the south. Conversion will be stopped. The plants that 
now have to produce canteens for 2,000 rubles apiece, which 
nobody needs, instead of submarines will go back to producing 
submarines. Western aid is nothing but provocation and 
hypocrisy. Foreigners are only a nuisance and not helpful. We 
will chase them away. Foreign politicians are honest in the way 
they treat us. They all hate Russia. We will help ourselves. 
  [Sajdik] How are your relations with the Russian president? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] My relations with Yeltsin are good. Now and 
then we meet for a game of checkers or play volleyball. He is a 
good man, I like him. He is calm and quiet. I do not mind him 
at all. He was deceived by radical reformer Yegor Gaydar and 
his people. He thought that their plans were good -- but 
everything failed. Now he is trying to neutralize the 
consequences of the activities of Gaydar and reformer Gennadiy 
Burbulis. 
  They are to blame for the destruction of the USSR and the 
creation of the CIS. Yeltsin is now embarrassed that he 
believed them. If I were him, I would have chased all of them 
out of the country or thrown them into prison. Yet, Yeltsin is 
a good man. However, I will not leave them alone but call them 
to account. They are afraid of me, which is why they call me 
"fascist" all the time. 
  [Sajdik] What are your plans for the future? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I want to become president. The 
parliamentary group does not offer any possibility to implement 
my program. As president the constitution gives me maximum 
powers and I can fulfill my promises. Yeltsin will not run 
again, and the people that have so far forced themselves to the 
foreground -- Sobchak, Volskiy, Gaydar, Yavlinskiy, and Travkin 
received less than 10 percent in the election. So I cannot see 
any opponent. 
  [Sajdik] What is your program? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I will concentrate on improving the living 
conditions of the Russians without getting rich myself. The 
others did nothing but steal: money was transferred to Western 
banks, children sent to school abroad, villas and limousines, 
everything achieved through fraud. Now they are leaving the 
sinking ship like rats. They cannot pay the price that I am 
asking -- the new Russia. 
  [Sajdik] What will your new Russia look like? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Ukraine will always be a part of Russia, in 
the same way in which the Crimea is Russian. I would not stop 
western Ukraine from seceding and becoming a small republic. 
Then they can eat their dumplings in Lvov but (gets up and 
turns out the light) in the dark because they will not get any 
more electricity. That will then be the end of Ukrainian 
nationalism. Yet, we will not take them back; the Germans or 
Swedes can feed them through. (turns on the light again) 
  [Sajdik] What does democracy mean for you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Democracy means that the majority makes a 
decision but not without taking the interests of the minority 
into account. We Russians take the decision to make the former 
borders of the USSR the borders of Russia yet we do not ignore 
the minority. The Estonians do not want that, which means that 
the Estonians will live in Tallinn -- in a mini-republic like 
Monaco or Andorra -- but without Russian raw materials, light, 
energy, and cars. 
  [Sajdik] You do not have a good press. Do you mind? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Nobody writes the truth about me. If you 
dare, write that Zhirinovskiy is a good, highly educated man, 
who got his diploma with distinction, knows four foreign 
languages, does not drink and does not smoke. Yet this is not 
what you are paid for. One has to write the opposite: 
Zhirinovskiy is a bad man, an anti-Semite, and a fascist.

  [Text] A member of the State Committee on State of 
Emergency, Oleg Shenin, currently on trial, categorically 
refutes the accusations of high treason and participation in the 
plot aimed at overthrowing the legitimate power. 
  He said during the legal proceedings in Moscow on Tuesday 
that his guilt was that he had failed to prevent the collapse of 
the USSR as a Soviet citizen and a communist. 
  According to Shenin, the real coup d'etat started not on 
August 19, 1991, but on April 24, 1991, with the signing of the 
draft treaty on establishment of a union (the Novoogarev 
agreement "9+1") and finished on December 8, 1991, with the 
agreement on establishment of the CIS. According to the 
accused, "this has broken the balance of forces and has been 
inevitably leading to the third world war, which is now at hand." 
  The issue on renewal of the case against Oleg Baklanov 
deferred due to his illness was also raised during the 
proceedings. However, this issue's consideration was postponed.

  [Text] A former member of the CPSU'S Central Committee, 
Oleg Shenin, who is standing trial for having plotted the August 
1991 coup attempt, maintains that what prompted the coup was 
"the inconsistent, cowardly and concessionary policy" pursued by 
the last Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev. 
  Gorbachev knew that Boris Yeltsin, as President of the 
Russian Federation, had no intention of signing the Union Treaty 
on August 20, 1991, and that he was about to liquidate union 
structures, Shenin told the Military Collegium of Russia's 
Supreme Court on Tuesday. According to the former Central 
Committee member, Gorbachev informed him of this in a telephone 
conversation on July 29, 1991. 
  "The Soviet Union's disintegration could have been prevented 
had Gorbachev imposed a state of emergency himself, instead of 
letting others do it," Shenin said. However Gorbachev preferred 
to sit it out in Foros, and refused to be flown to Moscow, 
Shenin declared. 
  According to Shenin, Gorbachev had nothing against the 
imposition of a state of emergency. "The wrong people are now 
charged with high treason," he said. 
  The court adjourned until Friday morning.

moderately rigid financial stabilization scheme with selective 
stimulation of individual industrial branches. 
  He said that if a moderately rigid credit and financial 
policy is pursued, the state budget deficit will stand at 
7-7.5% by the end of the year compared to the Gross 
Domestic 
Product, while the monthly inflation rate will be at 7-9%. 
  He said that the year 1994 must become decisive in the 
implementation of the radical economic reform. If the 
government fails to make achievements in the priority economic 
branches by controlling budget spending, the forecasts for the 
size of the budget deficit in 1995 will not come true, he said. 
  On Tuesday, Shokhin addressed the congress "Reality and 
Prospects for Russia's Economic Development." This forum's 
organizing committee is chaired by Secretary of the Russian 
Federation's Security Council Oleg Lobov, while the event itself 
was prepared by prominent economists Nikolay Petrakov, Leonid 
Abalkin and Stanislav Shatalin. The economists participated in 
the preparation of a report entitled, Socio-Economic Reforms in 
Russia; the Current Situation and New Approaches. 
  Anther author of the report, Stanislav Assekritov, vice 
president of the Reform International Foundation, expects the 
report to be discussed by the government at its meeting on 
February 24. He believes the document has much in common with 
the position of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who, he 
said, might "disown the results of the two years of shock 
therapy" at that meeting. 
  So far neither Chernomyrdin nor President Boris Yeltsin have 
responded to the report, said Assekritov, who doubts that the 
prime minister would make a public statement of his 
socio-economic position before Yeltsin gives his message to 
parliament on February 18. Only after that "will Chernomyrdin 
either do what the president would like him to or will just be 
swiping around," Assekritov said. 
  He said another two reports had been sent to the premier, 
one 
of them written by former Minister of Foreign Economic Relations 
Sergey Glazyev, today a member of the State Duma, where he 
represents the Democratic Party, and the other by economist 
Yevgeny Saburov, economics minister in Ivan Silayev's government.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Feb -- "Farmers' main concern today is to 
feed the country. Private farmers have already achieved a 
significant success in the past few years. Your products are 
more and more noticeable on the Russian table," says the 
greeting sent by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the 
delegates of the congress of the Association of Peasant Holdings 
and Cooperatives of Russia (AKKOR). 
  I fully realize that had the state rendered more substantial 
support to farms, their output would have been much more 
substantial too, says the greeting, released today by the 
president's press service. 
  "Farmers are becoming a noticeable and influential force in 
Russian society," the document emphasizes. "Remarkably, 
thousands of officers and warrant officers in reserve have 
received land plots. The time when you have only been posing 
problems is coming to an end. The main thing now is to find 
most effective solutions, together with the authorities, 
together with all those who want to help Russian agriculture."

  [Text] The Russian government has appropriated 550 billion 
rubles for Moscow to buy foodstuffs, Konstantin Buravlyov, First 
Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow city government in charge of 
economic reforms, told Interfax. 
  "Starvation became a real threat in Moscow at the end of the 
last year and in the beginning of this year," Buravlyov 
admitted. He said that Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov had succeeded 
in persuading the central government that the situation with 
essential supplies to the capital was critical. "The president 
and the prime minister had to intervene to remedy it," Buravlyov 
said. 
  In his words, 300 billion rubles were made available to the 
city to buy foodstuffs during the year at the current Central 
Bank discount rate. The only benefit Moscow will enjoy is that 
it will have to pay the credit back in the period from September 
to the end of 1994. 
  The government appropriated another 250 billion rubles for 
purchases of foodstuffs if other regions fhicf demand 
prepayment, Buravlyov explained. He also said that the food 
processing sector which needed raw materials accounted for one 
third of all of Moscow's industry. 
  At the same time, the Russian government owes Moscow 145 
billion rubles in mutual tax settlements.

  [Text] Russia is determined to stimulate world oil prices, 
a high-ranking source close to the Russian government told 
Interfax. 
  Government experts do not rule out the limitation of Russian 
oil exports for attaining this goal. They believe that "concern 
about falling prices in oil, Russia's main export item, has put 
us on a par with the OPEC countries." 
  The official said that according to Russia's sources, the 
OPEC countries are ready to brush away old disagreements and 
take coordinated measures to raise prices by $1 or $2 a barrel 
in the near future. 
  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Minister for 
Fuel and Energy Yuri Shafranik told the recent economic forum in 
Davos that Russia and OPEC would pursue a coordinated policy to 
increase oil prices by at least $1 a barrel. 
  The government sources point out that Russia may ensure a 
rise in oil prices by limiting its exports of crude oil. 
Experts of the Economics Ministry believe that in order to 
attain the set goal, Russia will have to cut down oil exports by 
at least 8% in the first quarter of the year on the condition 
that the OPEC states do the same. In their opinion, Russia is 
most likely to reduce oil exports to the former Soviet republics. 
  In 1993, Russia exported more than 80 million tons of oil to 
foreign countries. The coordinated oil export quotas for 
enterprises and territories for the first quarter of the year 
amount to 24 million tons. During the first three months of 
1994, Russia will export a total of about 30.2 million tons of 
oil.

  [Text] Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov stated that the city 
authorities would not implement the privatization program 
developed by the Committee for State Property and approved by 
the president. 
  Addressing the forum "Reality and Prospects for Russia's 
Economic Development," he said that the Moscow administration 
would work out a privatization program of its own. He accused 
the Committee for State Property, led by Anatoliy Chubays, of 
sacrificing economic results to politics and of squandering 
state money. 
  He categorically disagrees with the Chubays-developed 
program, according to which the privatization of enterprises in 
1994 will be based on their balance cost in 1991 prices. The 
1.5 Tn rubles at which the Committee for State Property 
estimated the property to be privatized for vouchers will not 
suffice even for maintaining this committee's bloated staff, 
stated Luzhkov. 
  He also said that the idea of democratic privatization was a 
failure and that the voucher funds will be a failure, too. The 
privatization program violates the law on property, sets the 
federation and its constituent members against each other, and 
disregards local conditions and specific features of individual 
branches and enterprises. 
  He emphasized that Moscow would be guided by its own 
interests and by the need to replenish the state treasury and 
stimulate industrial production. "If the Chubays program is not 
revised, we'll have many troubles," he said.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told 
reporters on Tuesday during his working visit to the Volga 
Military District that in 1994 Russian troops may be withdrawn 
from all of the CIS countries except the regions where Russian 
military bases will be created. 
  He also said that the withdrawal of the Russian forces from 
the former Soviet republics and from foreign countries creates 
problems in providing housing for Russian servicemen. 
  He said that next year the volume of housing construction 
will be increased and that in 1996-97 all servicemen will be 
provided with comfortable apartments. 
  He stated that a peacekeeping force would be created in the 
Volga Military District on the basis of the 27th motorized 
infantry division. 
  In addition, there is a motorized infantry division in the 
Leningrad Region which can also be used as a peacekeeping force. 
  This will be enough for tackling all peacekeeping tasks 
within the CIS and by decision of the UN, he said. 
  He expressed the opinion that Russia's air force can perform 
any peacekeeping mission without preliminary training. 
  On Tuesday, Grachev visited the construction site in the 
Samara Region where 1,910 apartments are being built for 
servicemen. From the Samara Region he went to Udmurtia where he 
met with local leaders

  [Text] The publication of more than 10 military 
periodicals -- from such specific ones as the journals AVIATSIYA 
I KOSMONAVTIKA and TEKHNIKA I VOORUZHENIYE, to popular weeklies 
(SYN OTECHESTVA and others) -- will stop in the very near 
future. According to reliable sources, Pavel Grachev has 
approved a draft order abolishing the military press. 
  Officially the reason for closing army publications is 
financial difficulties. According to another version, however, 
the main reason lies in Grachev's unhappiness over the lukewarm 
attitude by the subordinated press to his own personality, 
especially in the past few months.

<F P=106> [Report by military observer Viktor Badurkin: "We Write </F>
Dollar. Russia Loses Billions, Surrendering Arms Market to 
Competitors"] 
  [Excerpts] I remember five years ago when I first wanted 
to write an article about the arms trade I was advised not to 
touch on this "slippery" subject. They said that it was 
shameful to make money from other people's blood and that I 
should on the contrary advocate universal disarmament. And we 
have acted, and in such a way that the whole world has gasped. 
First we axed the army then the defense industry and we have 
"surrendered" the world arms market with virtually no 
resistance. We were applauded and warmly supported (verbally) 
but for some reason there were none who were eager to follow the 
example. 
  Today we have come to our senses. We have realized that it 
is shameful to squander irreplaceable natural resources, 
shameful when a great industrial power is assigned the role of a 
raw material tributary, shameful to ask for help and credits. 
And we have looked hopefully to our censured and destroyed 
defense industry: Save us, dear defense industry, earn currency 
for the country. 
  But what can it do if the majority of the sector's plants 
are 
still on compulsory Christmas vacation because of the shortage 
of funds and resources, if the state has still paid less than 
half of what it owes for output bought last year and the 
financing of science has been reduced almost tenfold?... 
[passage omitted] 
  Gennadiy Yampolskiy, deputy chairman of the State Committee 
for the Defense Industry, admits that so far warehouse stocks of 
arms and equipment have been sold off -- mainly items with which 
our army is "stuffed full." The producers of new output have 
mostly remained without orders. Because "fresh" models cannot 
be exported. And if someone does try to overcome these bans and 
restrictions he soon realizes it is a hopeless business. 
  At the "Fakel" plant near Moscow they designed a very 
"intelligent" air defense missile. And they did so at their own 
initiative and using their own funds. There is no shortage of 
people anxious to buy it, including the Russian Defense 
Ministry. But the trouble is that no one in this country has 
money and it cannot be sold abroad without special permission. 
And the "commodity" is left with no demand for it. [passage 
omitted] 
  It would be all right if it were only foreign businessmen 
who 
were preventing us from trading. One can understand them. But 
how can one understand our own Russian Government, which is 
"putting spokes in the wheels?" To draw up an ordinary contract 
you need to spend 12-18 months touring the corridors and bowing 
and scraping in offices. Over the course of three years there 
have been 12 (!) decisions by the president and government on 
deliveries of aircraft to China and the sale of licenses. And 
far from all the decisions were irreproachable. For instance 
one Russian firm agreed with the Chinese that the latter would 
pay for their deal half in currency and half in barter but the 
joint government commission gave our southern neighbors the 
go-ahead to reduce the currency proportion to 35 percent. Here 
barter is subject to such taxes that it is becoming 
disadvantageous to import it to Russia. Or take another 
example. Our aircraft industry officials reached an agreement 
with the United Arab emirates for the delivery of output worth 
several hundreds of millions of dollars but after Vice Premier 
Shokhin's trip there it emerges that three quarters of the 
profits will go to pay state debts. Enterprises naturally do 
not like this "aid" from the state -- they have to pay their 
workers' wages, settle accounts for deliveries and taxes. No 
one now wants to work at a loss. 
  It is an open secret that one of the main aims of any 
international meetings at all levels is to "push" one's own 
goods on the foreign market, including the market in arms and 
military equipment. Our defense industry officials expect as 
much from their own government. And not directives with a 
mounting list of countries with whom it is "not recommended" 
that contracts be maintained for various short-term political 
reasons. There should be a reduction in the export duty, not an 
increase in taxes. You can only shear a sheep which has managed 
to grow a fleece, you can take nothing from a naked sheep except 
its skin and its meat. [passage omitted] 
  Our newspaper recently wrote about the fiber-optic equipment 
developed at Chelyabinsk-70, which surpasses in quality any 
foreign counterparts and is far cheaper. And then what? The 
Americans intend rapidly to lift the ban on the sale of their 
fiber-optic technology to Russia which, according to their 
calculations, could bring in about $100 million in annual 
profit. But the Russian Federation Communications Ministry is 
signing documents on the construction in Voronezh of a plant for 
the production of cable using the technology of British and 
German firms. Again the result is that no one is a prophet in 
his own country. We subsidize foreigners and bar the way to our 
own people. 
  It is naive and futile to hope that the defense industry 
will 
become a "golden fish" by itself and bring the state sufficient 
currency without support. The hen which lays the golden eggs is 
also in need of care and feeding.

  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- "Russia has military 
production which is competitive enough to find its buyer. This 
will make it possible to earn money for conversion and preserve 
highly qualified staff of the domestic (military) industry", 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in an address to 
readers published in the first issue of a new journal, "The 
Military Parade", which was presented at a news conference here 
Tuesday. 
  The new edition, which is available both in Russian and 
English, is aimed at providing Russian and foreign readers with 
updated information about the Russian defence complex 
development, new sample weapons and military equipment. 
  The first issue specifically describes the new combat 
helicopter KA-50 "Black Shark", 152-mm self-propelled howitzer 
"MSTA-S", the air defence system "Arrow-10MZ", the state-of-art 
aircraft complexes, and the modern submarine "Piranha". 
  "This is the first step towards the implementation of the 
large-scale program to support defence industries in Russia and 
extend the export of Russian weapons and technologies of binary 
usage", the news conference participants said. 
  The journal has been founded by the League of Defence 
Industries, the association of investors in the Russian defence 
complex conversion, and the U.S. company "Zigzag Venture Group". 
  Authors will include Russian top military officials, 
developers and producers of weapons and military materiel, 
scholars, experts and all those whose activities are related to 
this field. 
  Such a publication has been long required by Russian 
military 
producers and their foreign customers, the journal's chief 
editor Yevgeniy Shashkov finalized.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- Russia's nuclear power is 
an a difficult situation. On the one hand, the concept of the 
development of nuclear power envisaging the putting into 
operation on 24 new power plants by the year 2010 is taking 
shape. Some of these power generating sets will replace the 
reactors that exceeded the prescribed service life. On the 
other hand, energy consumers are in no hurry to pay for 
electricity to Russian nuclear power stations, so there are no 
funds to pay salaries to operators on time and to purchase the 
neccesary equipment and fuel. 
  The shock that affected the population and even, in some 
measure, nuclear power specialists after the Chernobyl accident 
seems to be wearing off, and the crisis of nuclear energy is 
passing. Even the Cossaks on the Don who used to support 
environmentalists now see the need for the use of nuclear power 
in the region. Cossaks asked the Russian Ministry of Nuclear 
Power to support their initiative for setting up a public 
information centre on nuclear power in Rostov-on-Don. 
  People in various areas begin to realise that there is no 
alternative to the use of nuclear power in present economic 
conditions. 
  Former union republics began to admit dependence on Russian 
nuclear power. The Armenian nuclear power plant inactive for 
over four years will soon resume operation. Its fifth reactor 
will go into operation by next winter. The republic's 
population will be supplied with light and heating. Gagik 
Markosyan, chief engineer of the Armenian station, told 
ITAR-TASS that ties with Russian nuclear power specialists have 
nether been severed. Surveys of equipment and work to instal 
technical novelties is done with Russia's assitance. 
  Many research institutes and design offices are engaged in 
creating safer reactors. The new generation of water-moderated 
water-cooled power reactors is being designed by the regional 
design office "hydropress" (Podolsk, the Moscow region). The 
reactors will be used at the nuclear power stations in the Cola 
peninsula, the Far East, the Leningrad region. Foreign 
countries, for instance, China and Iran show interest in this 
reactor, Valentin Fedorov, general designer, director of 
"Hydropress", told ITAR-TASS. Agreements are beign drafted with 
some foreign countries. 
  Meanwhile, difficulties are expirienced by nine Russian 
nuclear power stations at which 29 power generating states now 
operate. Energy consumers have debts running into hundreds of 
billions of roubles. The Novovoronezhskiy nuclear power plant 
is about to stop. There is no money to pay salaries to the 
staff. The preventive repair of the fifth reactor that was 
planned for January has not yet began. There is no money to pay 
for the ordered spares. The Leningrad, Kursk and Smolensk 
nuclear power stations have fuel reserves to last them about a 
fortnight. Experts now cast about for a way out that would be 
more effective than seeking new credits.

  [Text] The Russian Navy's command will finish working out a 
schedule for operations which will prevent dumping radioactive 
waste products in Far Eastern waters. This was announced by the 
Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief, Feliks Gromov, at a meeting of 
the government's commission led by Chairman of the State 
Committee for Control over Atomic Safety, Yuriy Vishnevskiy, on 
the settlement of the issue concerning radioactive waste 
products. 
  The state committee's press service told INTERFAX that the 
commission's meeting decided to set up a specific working group 
for examination of the situation with radioactive waste products 
in the Far East. This group is to work out a report for the 
Russian government. 
  The commission also discussed the operations schedule within 
the scope of the special federal program for 1994 on processing 
and utilization of radioactive waste products and used nuclear 
substances. 
  This problem became especially significant after the 
incident 
in October, 1993, when radioactive waste products were dumped 
into the Sea of Japan. This caused protests from Japan, South 
Korea and the environmental organization Greenpeace.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "President Aliyev's Visit to </F>
Turkey"] 
  [Excerpts] President Geydar Aliyev's visit to Turkey is the 
most important recent development. Aliyev will hold talks with 
President Suleyman Demirel and several officials in that 
country. What do our people expect from his visit? 
  Azerbaijan's Turkic people have a problem at the present 
time. A way must be found to end the war in the Republic, which 
has continued for six years. A way must be found to quickly end 
the aggression and fighting. The Armenian military forces must 
withdraw from the territories they have occupied in Azerbaijan. 
In short, Azerbaijan's people want the aggressor to be punished 
and peace and security to be reestablished. 
  Undoubtedly, neighboring countries must give support to 
Azerbaijan to help it end the Armenian aggression. That is 
essential. They must help us convey Azerbaijan's just and 
honest views to the world. 
  Turkey is one of the countries that help Azerbaijan 
establish 
peace and security on its territory. That country has 
significant political influence in the world. In view of that, 
we have vested significant hope in Turkey's support for 
Azerbaijan's effort to sign a peace agreement to quickly end the 
war. The hope we have vested in Turkey is based on many things. 
The language, religion, and traditions of the two peoples are 
very similar. We have a common language, religion, history, and 
literature. The two peoples have been attacked throughout 
history. They have waged a joint struggle against the enemy. 
  We wish to recall the tragic incidents the Armenians created 
in Azerbaijan early in the century. Drawing strength from their 
supporters, the Dachnak Armenians carried out bloody massacres 
in Azerbaijan. Armenian terrorist activities were widespread in 
our Republic. Turkey extended a helping hand to Azerbaijan's 
people at the time. It took an active part in the effort our 
people made to evict the Dachnak Armenians from our territory. 
However, the Dachnak Armenians took action once again 70 years 
later. Their new action is based on many reasons. You may ask 
why the Turkic peoples do not move against a handful of 
Armenians? It is common knowledge that the Armenians have never 
been alone in their bloody crimes against the Turkic peoples. 
Powerful and influential countries have always supported them 
behind the scenes. The Armenians have been used as an 
instrument. 
  The Armenians also created tragic incidents in Turkey. They 
wished to divide that country early in the century. However, 
Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, succeeded in creating 
unity in that country and achieved victory. 
  It is as if history is repeating itself. Aggressive circles 
have drawn up bloody designs against Azerbaijan's Turkic people. 
They wish to divide and fragment Azerbaijan to usurp its 
resources. However, they will not realize their objectives. 
Azerbaijan's sons have arisen. That has been confirmed by our 
national Army's recent victories. 
  Turkey is the only country whose policy toward Azerbaijan 
complies with its intentions. Several of Azerbaijan's neighbors 
maintain a biased approach on the fighting in our Republic. 
Vague and deliberate reports are frequently published in their 
newspapers. In fact, several of them claim that Karabakh is a 
historic Armenian territory and argue that the pressure on the 
Armenians in Karabakh kindled the war in the region. [passage 
omitted] 
  It would be better if the neighboring countries helped 
Azerbaijan at this difficult time to convey its just and honest 
views to the world. That is because Azerbaijan needs moral 
support more than material aid. Deliberately vague views 
confuse the international community. 
  It must be stressed that the Armenians have occupied more 
than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory and more than 
1,000,000 peaceful residents have become refugees. Turkey has 
been the only country to convey our just and honest views to the 
international community and to take serious action in 
international organizations. In view of that, we are convinced 
that President Aliyev's official visit to Turkey will further 
enhance the cultural unity and friendly relations between the 
two countries. We are also convinced that Turkey will expose 
the true nature of the Armenian aggression to the international 
community. 
  We wish success to President Aliyev. We hope that the 
outcome of his visit will be successful and auspicious.

  [Text] Baku, Feb. 8, IRNA -- The visiting Iranian deputy 
foreign minister Mahmud Va'ezi met here Monday night [7 
February] with Azeri President Geydar Aliyev who called for the 
speedy implementation of the agreements already reached between 
the two countries. The Azeri president termed the last October 
visit to Baku of his Iranian counterpart Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani as a "turning point" in bilateral relations 
and congratulated the 15th anniversary of the victory of the 
Islamic revolution in Iran. 
  Aliyev also expressed hope that in his next month visit to 
Tehran he would discuss new ways to promote bilateral relations 
with the Iranian official. Outlining latest developments in 
Karabakh conflict, the Azeri president reiterated Baku's 
willingness to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. 
  He called as "unacceptable" the existing conditions offered 
by Armenia for the establishment of peace in Karabakh and 
stressed that Azerbaijan was fully ready to defend its 
territorial integrity. 
  Va'ezi, in charge of Euro-American affairs of Iran's Foreign 
Ministry, emphasized that he would try to remove the existing 
obstacles on the way of the implementation of Tehran-Baku 
agreements. The Iranian official arrived here yesterday on a 
three- day visit during which he will inaugurate Iran's new 
consulate here. 
  He held talks with Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov upon 
arrival.

  [Text] Baku (February 7) TURAN--A group of Russian military 
inspectors presently is visiting Ganja, Press Center of the 
Popular [People's] Front of Azerbaijan reports states, citing a 
reliable source. 
  The inspection is aimed at researching the situation and 
material-technical conditions of the former Russian 
landing-troops military base #104, which was withdrawn from 
Ganja in May 1993 under President Elchibey. 
  TURAN believe that the military inspection by Russian 
officers testifies that plans for a Russian troop return to 
Azerbaijan is being carried out. Though officially, Baku denies 
this, reports from Moscow prove that the return of Russian 
troops to Azerbaijan is practically agreed upon. TURAN news 
agency has reported that one of the Russian military bases will 
be stationed in Ganja. Moreover, Moscow insists on stationing 
its landing forces in Lenkoran and Nakhichevan, it also demands 
the creation of Russian Air Forces base on a former Soviet Air 
Forces base in Azerbaijan.

along the front during yesterday, according to a source at the 
Azeri Defense Ministry. 
  According to the information available, Armenian commanders 
carries out the regrouping of its forces at the northern 
(Agdere) and southern (Fizuli) sectors of the front. Extra 
units and armored equipment is being transported there. 
  As soldiers of the Azeri army report, the most of the 
destroyed Armenian tanks and arms were made in Russia in 1993. 
The seized arms testify that Armenians receive arms from Russia 
and other countries. As reported earlier, Russian aircraft 
transporting hardware made tens of trips from Sochi to Gumri. 
According to the reports of the Western sources from Armenia, 
these aircraft transported arms and fuel to Armenia.

<F P=106> [Report by political expert Aleksandr Iskandaryan: "Geydar </F>
Aliyev Needs Victory at the Front in Order To Begin Peace Talks"] 
  [Text] Tank fighting comparable in scale with medium-sized 
battles of World War II has been continuing for nearly two 
months on the North Nagorno-Karabakh plain. At the same time 
pitched battles are under way close to Azerbaijan's border with 
Iran. Why is this happening right now, when both sides have 
little hope of resolving the conflict by military means? 
  A few months ago Armenian troops won such convincing 
victories that it seemed that Azerbaijan had no army left at 
all. Nonetheless since mid-December the Azerbaijan troops have 
been making successful advances despite powerful resistance. 
  President Elchibey's unsuccessful attempts to leave Russia's 
zone of influence and to appeal to Turkey have ended in the 
realistic Geydar Aliyev coming to power and to Azerbaijan 
joining the CIS. The latter event is of a partly paradoxical 
nature since Azerbaijan believes its opponent in the Karabakh 
war to be not Karabakh as such but Armenia and the CIS thus 
becomes the only alliance of states of its kind in which two 
members are at war. This state of affairs automatically assigns 
Russia, as the nucleus of the CIS, a stabilizing role in the 
conflict. By the very fact that it has joined the CIS 
Azerbaijan is unambiguously claiming what is already due to 
Georgia in the light of its treaty with Russia -- the 
consolidation of its national army. 
  Five conditions are being set at the secret talks between 
Russia and Azerbaijan. They include the protection of 
Azerbaijan's foreign borders by forces of the Russian border 
troops, the presence of Russian military bases on Azerbaijani 
territory, the creation of a 12-mile Azerbaijani maritime zone 
on the Caspian oil shelf instead of the 50-mile zone on which 
Baku is insisting, recognition of Russia as the only mediator in 
the Karabakh conflict, and Azerbaijan's recognition of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh republic in one form or another. These 
speculations are partly confirmed by the statement made by 
Grachev in Tbilisi to the effect that Russia will have military 
bases in all three Transcaucasus republics while there is no 
public agreement with Azerbaijan on this score. Russia's role 
could prove very constructive if only because Russian troops, 
expelled by Elchibey, will appear on Azerbaijan's territory. 
  Something else is also undoubted: Such steps would be 
extremely unpopular inside Azerbaijan and only a leader with 
very strong positions in his own country would venture to take 
them. At present Geydar Aliyev does not have such a credit of 
trust with the population. The leadership of this country at 
war can effectively enhance its popularity rating by only one 
means: successes at the front. 
  In that case Baku's strategy is as follows: to achieve a 
"limited" military victory with a view to strengthening Aliyev's 
prestige. He thus gets carte blanche for concessions and steps 
toward peace. Actually, it should not be forgotten that on the 
other side of the front line are the field commanders of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, who have no time for big-league 
politics. They have no intention of strengthening Aliyev's 
reputation, do not agree to a "limited" military defeat, and are 
ferociously defending every meter of Karabakh land.

  [Text] Vilnius February 8 TASS -- A Ukrainian-Lithuanian 
treaty on friendship and cooperation was signed today by 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, currently here on a one-day 
official visit, and Lithuanian leader Algirdas Brazauskas. 
Another three economic agreements were signed by heads of 
Ukrainian and Lithuanian ministries and departments. 
  Kravchuk and Brazauskas praised the documents at a news 
conference and described them as "historic and upgrading the 
Lithuanian-Ukrainian relations." 
  Asked whether the Ukrainian striving to join the Partnership 
for Peace program will influence its relations and negotiations 
with Russia, Kravchuk said it won't happen since Russia may also 
join the program. 
  As for the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian president noted 
"it 
is a vitally important problem for Ukraine, and it should be 
settled on a mutually beneficial basis, which is being done. 
Russia is a Ukrainian foreign political priority. One should 
distinguish the state policy from the policy of the opposition. 
We stand for good-neighbourly peaceful relations with Russia." 
  Both presidents called for the expansion of 
Ukrainian-Lithuanian economic relations, which have not reached 
a worthy level. 
  Kravchuk suggested Ukrainian use of the Klaipeda port to 
"give Ukrainian goods way to northern Europe via the Baltic Sea 
and Lithuanian goods -- to the south via Ukrainian Black Sea 
ports".

<F P=106> [News conference by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas </F>
and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at the Seimas radio 
studio; Kravchuk speaks in Ukrainian with passage-by-passage 
translation into Lithuanian; translated from the Lithuanian; 
correspondents not named -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The treaty on friendship and cooperation 
has just been signed and the presidents are going to hold a news 
conference. The news conference is relayed live from the Seimas 
radio studio. 
  [Brazauskas] The Ukrainian delegation. [sentence as heard] 
We are happy to witness a great event in our political lives. 
We have defined, I can even say we have improved our relations 
with a great state such as Ukraine. Today's visit will make a 
very good and positive impression on our lives. 
  We have discussed possible paths for our further cooperation 
with Mr. President and his delegation. We also spoke about the 
improvement of these relations, we touched upon foreign policy 
matters as well. I congratulated Mr. Kravchuk on Ukraine's 
decision [changes thought] and I believe that namely today the 
Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs is signing the Partnership 
for Peace agreement. [Words indistinct] today join the ranks of 
partners, especially such a mighty partner as Ukraine. 
  Discussing the issues of our domestic policies we, of 
course, 
spoke mostly about the progress of economic reform and about the 
results of this progress, both positive and negative. We shared 
our experience [in this sphere]. 
  [Kravchuk] Ladies and gentlemen, in sharing the conclusions 
and assessments that President Brazauskas of Lithuania has just 
spoken about, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, and the 
Government of Lithuania for the hospitality and the friendly 
attitude you have shown to us. I am convinced that the signing 
of today's documents are a very important step, that another 
step will be taken in Kiev, that the President of Lithuania Mr. 
Brazauskas, will visit Ukraine and that I will officially invite 
him to visit our state. Thank you 
  [Correspondent] A question from the Baltic News Service. I 
would like to ask the president, do you think that the idea to 
set up the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea alliance has any future? 
If so, what meaning could be attached to that idea? 
  [Kravchuk] I think that the Eastern and Central European 
initiative that Ukraine proposed and which coincides in many 
aspects with similar initiatives proposed by Poland, France, and 
other states, makes possible the creation of such an alliance 
with the Baltic states, Ukraine, and other states. It is 
important for me to stress that when we speak about such an 
alliance, we are not talking about any blocs, any military or 
political blocs, but about security zones, about economic and 
political cooperation, and foreign political interaction. We 
have all the grounds for this. 
  [Brazauskas] I would like to say a few words. The initiative 
that has been shown by Ukraine and the Ukrainian president and 
which has been supported is not, of course, aimed at forming a 
military bloc, nor is it intended to do so. Therefore, the 
French initiative, or more precisely, the initiative shown by 
the French Prime Minister coincides with the above mentioned 
initiative. These are very concrete steps toward general 
European cooperation. I think that the Partnership for Peace is 
one of the main means available in Europe today for carrying out 
this cooperation. 
  [Correspondent] A question from Ukrainian television. I have 
a question to the presidents, the presidents of Ukraine and 
Lithuania. Please explain -- the economic foundation is the 
priority for future relations between our states, after all, 
these economic documents were signed today after the political 
document was signed. What are the basic directions in this 
development? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] First of all, I would like to stress that 
economic 
relations between Ukraine and Lithuania are not just the 
beginning of such relations. We have a good foundation and 
traditions, and on the basis of these we should build and 
broaden our economic relations by laying a new road and 
principles. At present they do not correspond to our 
possibilities. There are objective reasons for this: The 
settlement crisis and the introduction of our own currencies. 
All this has had an effect on relations but the prospects and 
the possibilities are too broad, and we have already spoken with 
Mr. President about the possibilities for trade and cooperation 
in the field of transport through the Baltic ports; we could 
have access to this region through the Black Sea and Lithuania 
could have access to other regions. Therefore, we have good 
prospects and good possibilities. I spoke about this and once 
again would like to stress that today we have signed an 
important political document, which is also partly an economic 
document. I hope that new documents will be signed in Kiev. 
Our cooperation and relations in the economic sphere will be 
broadened and will deepen in all aspects. 
  [Brazauskas] I would like to say a few words on the same 
topic. The currently existing developed transport communication 
lines that link the Baltic Sea with the Black Sea, can be and 
should be utilized. What is important here is that an 
agreement, and I would think that there would be no doubt about 
that, should be reached on these issues with Ukraine and 
Belarus. Our shipbuilding and ship repair enterprises use steel 
that is exclusively manufactured and imported from Ukraine. 
Therefore, we are greatly interested in cooperation, first of 
all, in this sphere. I think that while both our states are now 
moving toward a market economy, and this process is not an easy 
one, our cooperation should be organized in such a way that it 
will become a very broad and beneficial relationship. 
  [Correspondent] A question from KOMMERSANT DAILY ROSSIYA. 
A question to President Kravchuk. Esteemed Leonid Makarovich, 
Ukraine is the first country in the CIS to join the Partnership 
for Peace agreement today. Can you tell us please what impact 
the new situation would have on the rather complex relations 
with Russia, first of all because of the Black Sea Fleet and 
with the world community concerning the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons. Does Ukraine intend to become a full member of 
NATO? 
  [Kravchuk] I think that first, the signing of this 
initiative 
by Ukraine will not have any bearing on relations with Russia, 
because perhaps Russia will also sign this initiative on 
Partnership for Peace too. After all, this initiative is open 
to all countries. When we all become members, [changes thought] 
not members, but when we all sign this initiative then there 
will be real cooperation between all states. Second, I am 
convinced that resolving the nuclear arms problem and 
implementing the trilateral agreement by all sides, which was 
signed in Moscow, we will, at the same time, strengthen the 
positive attitude and friendly relations between Russia and 
Ukraine. I am convinced that we will also resolve the issue of 
the Black Sea Fleet, because I know that unless the pressing 
problems of nuclear arms and the Black Sea Fleet are resolved, 
it will be difficult to build normal friendly relations with 
Russia. Our political relations with Russia are especially 
important. I am convinced that this particular meaning will 
have realistic content if there is goodwill on the part of 
Russia and Ukraine. I consider that the Partnership for Peace 
initiative does not contradict the interest of all states but 
will favor understanding, cooperation, and the working out of 
certain programs and policies of our foreign policy and also of 
other states, and this is really being done for the benefit of 
peace and not confrontation. It is the right of every state to 
determine its own foreign policy. 
  [Kravchuk] By way of conclusion, I would like to say that 
the 
problems that currently exist between Russia and Ukraine should 
not be deliberately exacerbated because we are aspiring to 
resolve them through mutual understanding and mutual support. 
We are attempting to build these relations for the future so 
that nobody sows the seeds of discord among our peoples, because 
our future lies in friendly, and I stress, in friendly and 
businesslike relations with Russia, our neighbor, with which we 
have the most interests and where most of our foreign policy is 
directed. Finally, I would like you to listen to the policy 
that the Ukrainian state is pursuing and not to listen to the 
statements made by the opposition, because they do not 
principally coincide with this most important problem. 
  [Correspondent] A question from UKRINFORM agency. This is a 
question to the head of the Republic of Lithuania. Currently, 
in your country there are approximately 50,000 Ukrainians. 
Could you say that they live in your country like at home. You 
probably discussed this problem today with the Ukrainian 
president. 
  [Brazauskas] I think that the Ukrainian national minority, 
which comprises about 50,000 people, are Lithuanian citizens 
enjoying full rights and there are no problems whatsoever in 
this matter. We are glad that people of all nationalities, 
including Ukrainians, have taken up Lithuanian citizenship. The 
overwhelming majority of them have taken up Lithuanian 
citizenship. Today, these people are taking an active part in 
the country's political and social life. I hope that when Mr. 
President meets representatives of the Ukrainian community he 
will hear the same thing that I have just said. 
  [Announcer] This was a live relay of the news conference 
held 
by the Lithuanian and Ukrainian presidents at the president's 
office in Vilnius.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys left for Copenhagen 
today. The Latvian and Estonian foreign ministers are expected 
to arrive there too. A meeting with Danish Foreign Minister 
Niels Helveg Petersen will be held to discuss the links of the 
Baltic states with NATO. 
  The three foreign ministers were invited to Copenhagen to 
discuss the Partnership for Peace agreement, because Denmark 
feels it has a special responsibility for the Baltic states. 
The agreement is not yet a proposal to become a member of NATO; 
however, it provides the possibility of taking part in joint 
military exercises and receiving consultations from NATO if a 
threat arises against these states. 
  It has been proposed to determine the date of the expiry of 
the agreement and the conditions of future membership. Apart 
from this, the costs with regard to the partnership and 
practical means of cooperation wdill be discussed at the meeting. 
  The relations of the Baltic countries with the European 
Union 
will be one of the issues under discussion.

  [Text] The Lithuanian Seimas has urged the parliaments of 
Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia to do everything they 
can to stop the killing in the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. On Tuesday the Lithuanian parliament made a 
statement condemning the act of terrorism carried out in 
Sarajevo on 5 February, when tens of civilians were killed in 
the capital city of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Lithuanian 
parliament has also voiced support for the efforts of the United 
Nations, NATO, and other international organizations to 
normalize the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 07, BNS -- Vytautas Landsbergis, 
leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition, urged 
Lithuanian authorities to ask NATO for help because "the 
military ring around Lithuania does not weaken but strengthens." 
  Landsbergis said Lithuania should already use the rights 
given by NATO's Partnership for Peace plan and must invite NATO 
experts to observe the situation in and around the Baltic 
region. At a press conference Monday [7 February], the 
opposition leader said the step is necessary because Russia 
concentrates its military force in the Kaliningrad region, 
delays the withdrawal of its troops from the Baltics and creates 
its army bases in Belarus. 
  Landsbergis said Lithuanian leaders have not asked the 
alliance for help because they think the step may be interpreted 
as a challenge and may be annoying to Russia. 
  In Landsbergis' words, despite all statements by Western 
leaders that they do not want to set new borders in Europe, the 
continent is divided into three parts. 
  The opposition leader said the first and "safe" part of the 
continent is Western Europe, which comprises members of the 
European Union, NATO and "those on the threshold." 
  "Russia-dominated Eurasia" makes up the second part, he 
said. 
  The third, "exhausted" intermediate zone may turn to either 
side. The countries that belong to this zone are unwilling to be 
swallowed by the ruble zone or a military union with Russia, but 
they face such a threat, the opposition leader said. 
  Hence, Landsbergis said, Lithuania and other countries in 
this zone must make up their minds on how to regard Partnership 
for Peace - as a substitute for NATO membership or as a 
prerequisite for it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No One Knows the Price of the Signature..."] </F>
  [Text] Lithuania failed to be first among East and Central 
European countries to sign the "Partnership for Peace" [PFP] 
program. The Romanian foreign minister already signed this 
agreement on Wednesday [26 January] and ensured the possibility 
for his country to be first to settle in the Supreme 
Headquarters of Allied Powers in Europe [SHAPE] -- an office 
building specially provided for states not belonging to NATO. 
The Lithuanians secured a nook for themselves in this 
two-storied house on Thursday, when President A. Brazauskas put 
his signature under the agreement. However, history will include 
us in the list of the "first ones" because Lithuania surpassed 
all former USSR republics with its determination. 
  Observing the haste with which Lithuania rushed to sign the 
PFP program, one may suspect that it was afraid of missing an 
office in the SHAPE -- the first one is the winner. There even 
was no time to find out the price of this nook situated 65 km 
away from Brussels, and all additions -- maneuvers, humanitarian 
and peacekeeping missions, conferences, and so on. Article 6 of 
the PFP program reads that "states themselves finance their 
participation in the PFP activities and share duties in 
organizing maneuvers in which they themselves participate." The 
president himself recalled this fact at the signing ceremony. 
  The situation is laughable: No one knows the price of 
anything or what we will do in the PFP program, nevertheless, we 
want to be the first everywhere with the political and sport 
zeal typical of the Lithuanians. 
  The president's adviser D. Trinkunas claimed yesterday that 
His Excellency knew only the approximate price of the PFP, 
because his office did not make any estimates, and National 
Defense Ministry [KAM] employees had to inform A. Brazauskas 
about everything. 
  Meanwhile, E. Bajariunas, chief of the KAM International 
Relations and Agreements Department and a member of the 
government working group on the PFP, stated that there were no 
accurate estimates because countries participating in the 
program would themselves finance all events. According to him, 
Lithuania will participate in the PFP as much as the budget 
allows, because neither the KAM nor the Foreign Ministry has any 
finances assigned to this program for this year. 
  Remembering the facts that 130 million litai this year 
(about 
$33 million) has been earmarked for KAM, and that according to 
some officials, the PFP will cost Lithuania at least $10 million 
a year, there is no doubt that the KAM will fail to finance this 
program. 
  True, the figure $10 million also seems to be concocted, 
because according to V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas 
[parliament] National Security Committee, a company of "blue 
helmets" would cost Lithuania from $30 to $40 million. 
Certainly, one may expect assistance from neighboring 
countries, particularly from Scandinavia. However, they will 
hardly agree to cover such expenses. The notorious "armored" 
bicycles from Sweden's military aid have caused enough laughter 
throughout the world, and it would be high time to feel the 
ground under one's feet while dreaming. 
  Nor is there any reason to expect that Lithuania will find 
in 
its budget sufficient resources to participate in joint NATO 
maneuvers. There is a 165-million-litai deficit hole agape in 
our "state coffers" as of today. 
  "We do not yet imagine how much our participation in the PFP 
program will cost us," claimed the president at the 10 January 
press conference. 
  Many changes were expected after A. Brazauskas' visit to 
Brussels. Judging by the president's official statements and 
media reports, however, financial issues passed in oblivion, as 
fits an intelligentsia's company. 
  "We really have enough finances for summit visits," 
maintained E. Bajariunas and added immediately: "I am joking." 
However, this joke reminds us of reality very much. 
  Certainly, Lithuania can refuse joint maneuvers, 
peacekeeping 
and humanitarian missions, and other costly integral parts of 
the program. It is incomprehensible then, however, why we had 
to sign this document at all. It is the participation in joint 
military operations that can open the road to NATO in the future. 
  As an officer responsible for SHAPE's ties with Lithuania 
has 
reported, NATO countries will arrange almost 200 drills and 
training courses this year. Lithuanian representatives have 
been invited to 40 of them....

<F P=106> [Interview with Andranik Migranyan, political scientist and </F>
adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, by Laszlo Vida in 
Moscow; date not given: "The Period of Euphoria Has Also Come 
to an End in Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] The region of the post-Soviet states is the sphere 
of Russia's vital interests and, therefore, it is impossible to 
examine Moscow's relations with the "close foreign countries" 
according to general standards. This is how Andranik Migranyan 
described the Russian "Monroe Doctrine" that is increasingly 
penetrating even the official Russian foreign policy in his 
recently published essay. According to his own words, the 
well-known political scientist expressed his views as an 
"independent expert" in the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. However, given 
the fact that he is also a member of Yeltsin's group of 
advisers, his publications merit particular attention. First, 
we asked Professor Migranyan about the official reception of his 
essay. 
  [Migranyan] This writing met with an unfavorable reaction in 
the Foreign Ministry, but not because they do not agree with the 
essence of my thoughts, but because I criticized the Ministry 
and Andrey Kozyrev for not working out the government's foreign 
policy concept in time. Besides, the reaction to the subject 
matter of my writing also shows that the position of the Foreign 
Ministry leadership has gone through a firm evolution. 
Kozyrev's latest declarations in defense of the Russian 
minorities show that he wants to go even further in this 
direction and is trying to prove that he is a "hawk," a believer 
in tough solutions. 
  [Vida] Do you think that Kozyrev is capable of representing 
the emerging new Russian foreign policy? Not so long ago, he 
was still singing a different song altogether. 
  [Migranyan] Indeed, I also see a rather firm change in 
Kozyrev's attitude. To be honest, I could hardly tell whether 
he is capable of heading a foreign policy commensurate with the 
changed circumstances. My feeling is that, even if he tries to 
do it, the relevant domestic political circles will hardly take 
it seriously, because it looks as if he was simply clinging to 
his chair. All this also makes him less predictable for the 
West, which, naturally, would like to continue to negotiate with 
the previous Kozyrev whose position was clear and free of 
opportunism. 
  [Vida] If Kozyrev's constant claim that the president 
determines the country's foreign policy is true, everything you 
just said about him applies even more to Yeltsin. 
  [Migranyan] I think the president has the right to modify 
his 
course. However, in order to carry this out and to give a clear 
sign of this, he also has to carry out a personnel change at the 
leadership of the ministry. 
  [Vida] Judging from Western reactions to Gaydar and 
Fedorov's 
departure, Kozyrev's dismissal would cause a big stir, all the 
more so because the West, and particularly the United States, 
regards his presence as some kind of guarantee: As long as he 
is in place, there cannot be a too big problem. 
  [Migranyan] If the West made a case out of Kozyrev's 
replacement, this would only show its shortsightedness, because 
this would justify the anti-Western rhetoric of Yeltsin's 
opposition and, thus, it would only hit back at the West itself 
and, of course, at those who want to continue the reforms. The 
Ministry practically received a monopoly on shaping the Russian 
foreign policy from Yeltsin in the past two years, something not 
suprising if we consider the internal explosion danger he had to 
face and the fact that he has never dealt with foreign policy 
before. The Cold War is over, and friendly relations with the 
West must be built now with the end of confrontation and, 
obviously, Yeltsin had nothing against this. It is another 
matter what means can be employed to achieve all this. The 
president put Kozyrev in charge of the problem of the technical 
aspect and technology problems, and he supported him because the 
Western partners were satisfied with him. However, the times of 
euphoria have also come to an end in foreign policy, especially 
in the matter of illusions regarding the West. Central and 
Eastern Europe have slowly become sober, when Moscow was still 
speaking about an alliance with the West. It would have been 
quite strange to see this general enthusiasm justified, because 
politics is a "hard game" in which everyone follows his own aim, 
without any philanthropy. 
  [Vida] Do you think that the mentioning of the Russian 
sphere 
of interest raises certain apprehension in Western, Central, and 
Eastern European countries? This provides arguments to 
political forces who find it quite welcome that one can again 
speak of Russian expansion, for example, when talking about the 
need to expand NATO. 
  [Migranyan] Quite contrary. A failure to clearly determine 
Russia's interests would lead to misunderstandings. Every major 
power should clearly determine its zone of influence. A 
possible impression that Russia does not have individual 
interests at all would not be a good thing. 
  [Vida] In other words, Russia should be recognized as a 
major 
power. 
  [Migranyan] The Soviet Union had very clearly declared 
interests, complete with the means needed for the assertion of 
these interests. As the legal successor of the Soviet Union, 
Russia must again find its place in international politics. 
Uncertainty in this respect will only increase the camp of 
supporters of Zhirinovskiy and the like, and of communists, 
because their main complaint is that no one in the world counts 
on Russia any longer. Therefore, despite all their sympathy 
toward the West, the realists, and I am one of them, admit that 
we must clarify the things deriving from Russia's major power 
status. This is why I categorically oppose the demagogic 
practice of using the "Russian threat" to justify the need to 
expand NATO. Our former allies in Central and Eastern Europe 
are not led primarily by a real fear from Russia or the desire 
to join NATO; they are playing this card to join the Council of 
Europe as soon as possible and, in the meantime, to receive as 
many trade benefits and monetary injections as possible. We 
will not allow ourselves to be taken in by this demagogy. We 
can also mention Zhirinovskiy, because a few more such 
initiatives and power will fall into the arms of Zhirinovskiy. 
  I was one of those who publicly urged discarding the 
Brezhnev-doctrine, but one of our main arguments at that time 
was that no one wants to fill the vacuum left by the Soviet 
Union in Central and Eastern Europe. Such agreements emerged 
later. The German reunification did not take place in order to 
allow NATO to expand. The fact that Soviet Union collapsed does 
not exempt the West and the United States from the obligations 
they took upon themselves at the end of the eighties. One 
should not forget that, in the meantime, Russia got even farther 
from the region, and it has become weaker in every respect that 
the former Soviet Union. It is ridiculous to come up with the 
"Russian threat" today. 
  [Vida] One of the conclusions of your studies is that the 
post-Soviet region is the first test of the partnership 
relations between Russia and the West, where the West has to 
recognize Russia's special role. Has Clinton's visit given any 
hopes in this respect? 
  [Migranyan] The United States is exercising pressure on 
Ukraine in the nuclear arms affair. In Clinton's presence, 
Yeltsin made a tough statement about the situation of the 
Russian population in the Baltic states. They probably reached 
a certain agreement on the use of Russian troops as 
peace-keeping troops in the crisis points of the former Soviet 
Union: over the Caucasus, in Tadjikistan. It seems that the 
idea that Russia plays a particular role in guaranteeing 
stability in Euro-Asia is met with increasing support and 
understanding in the leading Western power. 
  [Vida] In your study, you repeatedly emphasized that the 
borders between the successor states, including Russia's 
borders, were determined artificially and they are far from 
being final. What do you suggest by this? 
  [Migranyan] Nothing more than the fact that, for the time 
being, we do not even know where Russia's borders lie: The 
situation of Chechnya, Tuva, Tatarstan, and Baskyria is 
flexible. The same way, Georgia's borders or Ukraine's borders 
are also unclear, because it has not been decided whether they 
will remain as independent states at all. The border issue 
first of all depends on this and, therefore, it would be too 
early to close the issue definitely. Because of the unsettled 
state of the successor states, the borders between them do not 
yet have the same function as the borders between other 
countries with many centuries of history. 
  [Vida] How do you envisage the future of the CIS? 
  [Migranyan] I am optimistic, because the latest 
reintegration process does not derive from subjective causes or 
the moods of a certain politician, but from objective factors. 
The former Soviet republics faced the fact that they are not 
expected anywhere and they have no place to join. Otherwise, 
they would not turn again toward Russia and toward one another. 
At the same time, Russia is not interested in forcing the 
reintegration process, because, with this, it would 
automatically take extra economic burdens upon itself. In my 
opinion, Moscow is absolutely aware of this.

  [Text] "We object unequivocally to air strikes against 
Serbian positions around Sarajevo," Anatoliy Zlenko, Ukraine's 
Foreign Minster, told journalists in Brussels Tuesday. He 
quoted military experts as saying that "the peace keeping units 
would immediately become hostages of such action." 
  Zlenko thinks that Serbians could then use the air strikes 
as 
a pretext to retaliate against the peacekeeping forces. 
  The Ukrainian minister thinks that a decision on air strikes 
should be made by the UN Security Council. He does not doubt 
that Russia would veto air strikes. 
  He did not rule out the possibility that NATO could make a 
unilateral decision and emphasized that the security of 
peacekeeping units had to be guaranteed, in particular the 
Ukrainian battalion. 
  Zlenko would not, however, welcome unilateral withdrawal of 
the Ukrainian unit, even if a decision to stage air strikes was 
made. He told the journalists that his country had earlier 
proposed adopting a convention on UN peacekeeping forces.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau February 8 TASS -- Moldovan President 
Mircea Snegur has accused leaders of the self-styled Dniester 
Republic of attempts to aggravate the socio-political situation 
in the left-hand bank areas of the republic and has warned the 
population about their possible provocations. These charges and 
warnings are contained in a presidential address to the people 
of Moldova, published here today. 
  "The unconstitutional authorities of the so-called Dniester 
Republic have blocked the implementation of the Moscow agreement 
on the peaceful settlement of the conflict, signed on August 21, 
1992," Snegur stressed. "This is evidenced by the deployment of 
Dniester armed forces within the zone of security, which was 
envisaged by the Moscow agreement, and their remaining 
fortifications there. The local population was actually shut up 
in a reservation by the special regime clamped down on the 
left-hand bank territory by the Tiraspol leaders," the Moldovan 
president claims. "Posts have been set up on roads and vehicles 
and citizens are being searched in a most humiliatory manner. 
Pressure is being exerted on villagers refusing to support the 
Tiraspol leaders. People are not allowed to set up voting 
stations for the upcoming parliamentary elections in Moldova." 
  Vice-president of unrecognised Dniester Republic Aleksandr 
Karaman stated today that Snegur's public warning against 
possible provocations prove that such acts are quite possible. 
"Definite forces in Moldova would like to put the blame for them 
on the Dniester Moldovan Republic, especially in the presence of 
foreign observers," Karaman stated. "However, it would be 
logical for us to keep very quiet and mild in such a situation," 
he added.

violated the Geneva agreement. On 6 February groups of armed 
militants attacked the Georgian population, killing 60 people 
and taking many people prisoner. Villlages were burned down. 
Militants also attacked a village in Tsalenjikha Rayon, killing 
five people. 
  About 3,000 people, including children and women, are 
sheltering in a gorge. It is difficult to evacuate them from 
there due to thick snow. The premier said that everything is 
being done to evacuate the population. 
  Heavy equipment, including 15 tanks, has been used to 
eliminate the Georgian population. Militants of Chechen, 
Cossack, and other nationalities had been brought to the area on 
Ikarus buses. 
  The premier stressed that the authorities of the Republic of 
Georgia have been doing everything to achieve a political 
settlement of the conflict. Not a single armed Georgian fighter 
is in the area. 
  The premier asked Mr. Starcevic to convey to the United 
Nations full information on the current situation in Abkhazia 
and force the separatists to observe the Geneva agreement.

  [Excerpts] A meeting of the Georgian Parliament was held 
today. The first issue on the agenda was the law on firearms. 
  This draft law was submitted by the Judicial Commission and 
was introduced to deputies by Givi Lominadze [the chairman of 
the Provisional Committee for Emergencies in western Georgia]. 
  There is also an alternative draft prepared by the Law and 
Order Commission. 
  Members of parliament are unanimous that it is very 
important 
for the country to adopt a firearms law. However, the process 
has been going on for quite a long time. 
  Before discussing the agenda, parliament started a debate on 
MP Vazha Otarashvili's proposal on the handover to parliament of 
the construction of the Cabinet of Ministers. Some members of 
parliament even called this proposal provocative. It was noted 
that issues like this could not be decided so simply. There 
were quite a few ethical and technical difficulties. It was 
also necessary to take into account the Cabinet of Ministers' 
opinion about the issue. 
  In examining the draft law on firearms, deputies mainly 
debated articles of the law relating to arms manufacturing and 
trade. Some deputies were in favor of a state monopoly on both, 
the manufacturing and trade. There was also the different view 
that supported the issue of licences to the private sector to 
conduct both these activities. 
  In the opinion of Givi Lominadze, one of the members of the 
judicial commission, the private sector should be allowed to 
manufacture arms, while only the state could trade in arms. 
[passage omitted] 
  After a break, parliament continued work. However, voting on 
the issue was postponed because of Deputy Speaker Vakhtang 
Rcheulishvili's announcement that Abkhazians had attacked 
villages in Gali Rayon. Civilians, including women, children 
and the elderly had fled to the woods for shelter. 
  The Georgian Parliament decided to prepare an appeal to be 
sent to the United Nations, Russia, and the other countries that 
are playing the role of peace guarantors in Abkhazia.

  [Text] The Central Committee of the Trade Union of 
Communication Workers of Russia has sent a letter to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Aleksandr Yakovlev, and the communications 
minister, which says that the protracted financial crisis at 
communication enterprises responsible for the broadcasting of 
state radio and television programs is far from being solved. 
  Repeated written requests from the Finance Ministry for the 
debts to radio enterprises to be repaid remain nothing but 
scraps of paper. As a result of the communication enterprises' 
inability to pay for electricity and other materials, radio 
centers in Kamchatka, Kalinigrad and other areas have been cut 
off. Most of Russia's radio and television enterprises are on 
the verge of stoppage. 
  Unless the demands of communication workers are met, from 10 
February only the transmission of morning and evening 
information programs from Ostankino and the All-Russian State 
Radio and Television Company will be provided.

  [Text] Ankara, 9 Feb -- Turkey advocates an "immediate, 
complete and unconditional" withdrawal of Armenian forces from 
the areas of Azerbaijan they have seized. This was stated 
yesterday by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel during a dinner 
in honor of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who is paying 
an official visit to Ankara. The Turkish leader noted that 
sooner or later, the Armenians would be forced to leave occupied 
Azerbaijani territory. 
  Turkey and Azerbaijan, Demirel said, have decided to 
strengthen bilateral cooperation not just at the interstate 
level, but also in international organizations like the United 
Nations, the CSCE, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, 
and regional economic groupings. The Turkish Republic will 
continue to assist Azerbaijan and support its "integration" with 
the international community. 
  The talks in Ankara, the Turkish president stressed, have 
been held in a candid atmosphere. "There are no problems in our 
bilateral relations," he said. 
  In his turn, Aliyev said that he was "determined" to 
preserve 
Azerbaijan's independence and to liberate territory under 
Armenian occupation. The young Azerbaijani Republic needs 
Turkish help. "We are two states," he said, "but one nation." 
  The same day, the Azerbaijani president held talks with the 
Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Aliyev is reported to have 
said that he might agree to the presence, under CSCE auspices, 
of Russian and foreign forces in the republic. He gave it to be 
understood that the question of building a pipeline to carry 
Azerbaijani oil across Turkish territory to the Mediterranean 
"will be decided in the near future." 
  A number of bilateral agreements on development of economic 
cooperation are expected to be signed today.

<F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to Seimas </F>
session in Vilnius -- live; in Ukrainian with 
sentence-by-sentence translation into Lithuanian] 
  [Text] [Words indistinct] friendly relations between our 
two states will become an important political step aimed at 
strengthening and widening of mutually beneficial bilateral ties 
in all areas of our mutual relations. The people of Ukraine 
have great esteem for the friendly Lithuanian nation with which 
we share ancient historical ties dating back to ancient times. 
  Our relations trace their roots from the times of Kiev Rus 
which played a significant role in the establishment of 
Lithuania. In its turn, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania helped 
Ukrainians to a great extent in preserving their traditions, 
language, and religion, and keeping the original culture of our 
people from extinction. It was during that period close ties 
between our states and our people originated, now adopting a new 
nature. 
  Who knows whether linguists are right in asserting a 
similarity between our languages? But when we hear the 
melodious Lithuanian language, it is indeed reminiscent of our 
native Ukrainian. At any rate, the name Kravchuk in Ukraine is 
usually followed alphabetically by names like Lytvyn, 
Lytvynchuk, and the like. 
  A notable event in the history of our relations was the 
peace 
treaty between Ukraine and Lithuania signed in 1921, according 
to which the then Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the 
Lithuanian Democratic Republic recognized each other's 
sovereignty and independence. A qualitatively new stage in the 
relations between our countries began in 1991, after Ukraine and 
Lithuania acquired state independence. It is symbolic that 
Ukraine was among the first to recognize Lithuania as an 
independent state, while Lithuania was among the first to 
recognize Ukraine's political independence. 
  We attach priority significance to our relations with the 
Lithuanian republic. They benefit not only from the old 
historical ties, but also from the common positions and views 
shared by our countries on a wide range of international and 
regional issues. A 
  factor which brings our people closer is the presence of a 
large Ukrainian community in Lithuania. I would like to take 
advantage of this opportunity and express through the esteemed 
Lithuanian Seimas our deep gratitude to the Lithuanian people, 
the president and the government of Lithuania for the attention 
they give to the national and cultural needs of Ukrainians. 
  Lithuania is one of Ukraine's biggest trade partners. 
However, the development of trade and economic ties between our 
states has not yet achieved its full potential. Ukraine and 
Lithuania could cooperate to mutual advantage in practically any 
area. This includes export of ore, coal, coke, rolled metal and 
metal products, electronic technology, and machine-building 
products from Ukraine. For its part, Ukraine expects to receive 
various products from Lithuania including consumer goods such as 
footwear and clothing, as well as products of the chemical and 
the electronic industries. 
  We have broad possibilities for cooperation in the area of 
transport. For example, Ukraine is interested in having access 
to the Baltic Sea and at the same time Lithuania could use the 
potential of Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. 
  I cannot omit to mention the broad perspectives for the 
development of cultural cooperation between our countries that 
have ancient traditions. It was here in Vilnius that Taras 
Shevchenko, the great Ukrainian poet, artist and thinker, took 
his first steps in art and literature. Lesya Ukrayinka, the 
distinguished Ukrainian poetess, was in the famous resort of 
Druskininkai. And the eminent Lithuanian poet Jonas Maironis 
worked in Kiev. 
  In my opinion we are obliged not only to preserve these 
traditions but to multiply them in every possible way and pass 
them on from one generation to another. In the period that has 
passed, a great legal foundation was laid on bilateral relations 
between our two states along diplomatic channels. Today we will 
sign a treaty on friendship and cooperation with President 
Brazauskas and I am convinced that it will open a new stage in 
the development of equal and friendly relations between our 
states. There is much that unites our peoples. 
  Unfortunately, today we have common problems. The transition 
to a market economy is quite a difficult and often painful 
process and we have felt this. However, Ukraine and I am 
convinced that Lithuania also, have consciously chosen this path 
and we will move step-by-step, by means of economic reform and 
interaction and one state helping another. 
  We are gradually carrying out privatization and 
demonopolization, are putting in order the financial and banking 
system and have adopted a program of anti-inflationary measures. 
Obviously, we have not managed to do all this quickly and 
effectively. There are factors, both internal and external, that 
stimulate this process and there are objective and subjective 
factors. Despite this we regard the future with optimism and are 
convinced that with time we will overcome these difficult times 
and these difficult processes because there is no other 
alternative. We hope to have mutually beneficial cooperation 
with all other states including with the Republic of Lithuania. 
Our emerging from the economic crisis will significantly speed 
up this process. As the Lithuanian popular saying goes, more is 
done when two people are at work. 
  Both Ukraine and Lithuania were always considered to be 
European states and we link our future with the new Europe and 
for this reason we aspire to be integrated with the European 
political, economic and other structures. Ukraine views 
positively the partnership for peace programme which was 
recently adopted at a NATO session in Brussels. We consider that 
an important step has been made in the area of building a new 
system of general European security and bringing Eastern Europe 
closer to the West. 
  In connection with this, we welcome the signing of this 
important document by the Republic of Lithuania and on our part 
we are preparing to carry out corresponding measures in the near 
future. Today our minister of foreign affairs is in Brussels. 
From the point of view of the mentioned special urgency, in our 
opinion Ukraine could put forward an initiative on the creation 
of a zone of stability and security in the Central and Eastern 
European region which would include all the countries of the 
Baltic and Black Sea region. It is possible that this initiative 
to some extent coincides with other projects regarding the 
general European security system. 
  In its declaration of state sovereignty, Ukraine proclaimed 
its intention to adopt a non-nuclear status, thus becoming the 
first state to voluntarily give up the nuclear arms it 
inherited. By this, it proved once again the peaceful nature of 
its foreign policy aimed at defusing tension in Europe and the 
entire world. An important step towards strengthening of 
international security and stability was the recent signing by 
Ukraine, the United States and Russia of a trilateral statement 
which envisages elimination of the nuclear arms deployed on the 
territory of Ukraine. 
  Esteemed ladies and gentlemen! Our peoples had to suffer 
bitter times and injustice on their road to freedom and 
independence. But in spite of that, we are building our 
statehood, reviving national culture and spirituality, we and 
look to the future with hope. I am convinced that this can be 
greatly helped by the development of friendly and mutually 
beneficial relations between Ukraine and the Lithuanian 
Republic, and by constant contact between the leadership of our 
countries, including that at the top level. 
  In conclusion, I would like to wish the esteemed Seimas 
fruitful work, and the friendly Lithuanian people - happiness, 
peace and prosperity on the road of independent development. I 
sincerely hope that relations between our states will develop 
and strengthen for the benefit of our peoples. Thank you for 
your attention.

  [Text] The Russian president's aide, Dmitriy Ryurikov, told 
Interfax that the Russian leadership was drafting a package of 
initiative on enhancing the efficiency of the CIS, to be 
discussed during the next CIS summit in Moscow in March. 
  He said that President Yeltsin, elected the CIS's first 
chairman during the Ashgabat summit, was going to use his status 
to the best advantage. "There is no talk about Russia's special 
role," he said. "However, in view of its colossal intellectual 
and organizational potential Russia can give the necessary 
impetus to the CIS's development," he added. 
  Russia continues drafting documents on several aspects of 
interaction between the CIS countries. In the first place, the 
declaration on economic union must be implemented, and this 
document must be supplemented with agreements on free trade, 
customs union, and the payment of the debts. 
  Every effort must be made to ensure the transparency of the 
CIS borders and to protect the CIS's external borders jointly. 
  He said a concept of the CIS's collective security must be 
drafted, based on the principles of voluntariness and equality. 
The state possessing the largest resources might provide a 
basis for military cooperation, he said. 
  In the humanitarian sphere, a covenant of human rights might 
be created to ensure the observance of political, social and 
property rights throughout the CIS, said Ryurikov.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 10 -- Today's newspapers do not 
focus on a single topic. The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper 
carries an interview with the Russian president's assistant 
Viktor Ilyushin who notes: "There is a segment of people who 
regard themselves democrats and are in a state of constant 
struggle. 
  "When Ryzhkov was cabinet head, they fought Ryzhkov. When 
Gorbachev became president, they fought Gorbachev. They are now 
fighting Yeltsin. I'm not sure that if another political leader 
comes into office in the future, they will stop fighting him. 
Although it is hard for us to live through all this, but this is 
a disease of our teenage years, I mean teenage years of 
democracy." 
  The same newspaper comments on a visit by Azeri President 
Geydar Aliyev to Turkey, noting: "The policy pursued by Geydar 
Aliyev completely convinced Ankara of the need for close 
cooperation with the new Azeri authorities. 
  "Besides, a concept put forth by Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev on ensuring Moscow's strategic interests in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, which provides for 
conducting peace-keeping operations in 'flash points' by Russian 
troops, is evidently not to the liking of Turkey having its own 
interests in Azerbaijan." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA reports in another article that 1,181 
emergencies were registered in the Russian Federation in 1993, 
with the number of casualties reaching 10,133. Out of the 
total, 1,224 people died. 
  The newspaper claims that "the year 1994 will witness a 
possible increase in the number of breakdowns and disasters on 
all types of transport, in the extracting and processing 
industries, expecially at mines, oil, gas and chemical 
enterprises, which will be caused by deteriorating repair work, 
delayed replacement of outdated mechanisms, unstable management 
of production, low technological and labour discipline and lower 
responsibility for labour safety." 
  The TRUD newspaper features an interview with former First 
Vice- Premier Yegor Gaydar who holds that "an amnesty is 
inopportune now". Explaining his viewpoint, he notes that "crime 
is rampant in the country. 
  "Moreover, the work on the previous amnesty has just been 
completed. The new amnesty has been poorly prepared 
organisationally. The declaration of an amnesty decree creates 
an illusion of impunity for a number of crimes listed in the 
decree." 
  The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper runs an article by prominent 
economist Yevgeniy Yasin, director of the expert institute of 
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who says: 
"The process of forming a market economy is progressing, 
irrespective of likes or dislikes of the government, the academy 
of sciences or anybody else. 
  "It is connected with the setting of new relative prices and 
new price proportions. They are being formed, despite 
interferences caused by the structure of our economy. 
  "An analysis we carried out last autumn shows that prices 
approach world ones where they are not regulated. This is a 
positive process on the whole. Regrettably, it has negative 
aspects, since enterprises feel that while in the past they had 
comfortable life and correleration of prices, production costs, 
technologies, etc. were balanced, they are upset now. 
  "However, if there were no disbalances, there would be no 
impetus for restructuring." 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper runs an interview with 
Gennadiy 
Voronin, deputy chairman of the Russian State Committee on 
Munitions Industries, who states that the Russian Navy is now 
living through "a stage of delapidation. 
  "Time is needed for what we should do to overcome this stage 
in compliance with the new military doctrine: to do with small 
numbers but high quality. Regrettably, the Navy lacks this 
quality to acquire new properties that is it has no new high 
precision weapons, advanced ships, control systems, etc. 
  "To tell the truth, we do not have now a programme for 
combat 
materiel we earlier had for 10 or 15 years ahead. We have been 
waiting for it for 18 months. It has been compiled and 
initialled. 
  "However, it is not yet an official document which could be 
sent to our factories. I believe that it will be approved in 
the first quarter of this year." 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper carries an interview with 
Pyotr Romanov, member of the Federation Council (upper chamber 
of the Russian parliament), in whose opinion "it is a crime to 
say, as some politicians do, that we shall live better this year. 
  "They had no right to extrapolate on our country some or 
other programme drafted or tested somewhere in the West. Russia 
is neither Germany, nor Poland, nor America, nor still Israel. 
Our Russian people handle a situation and appraise it in their 
own way." 
  The same newspaper runs an interview with defence lawyers of 
former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, saying that "if 
the court does not give a political appraisal to this case (eds: 
events of September-October 1993 in Moscow), this will be 
totally wrong". 
  The PRAVDA newspaper reports that Russian Procurator-General 
Aleksandr Kazannik visited Ruslan Khasbulatov at the Lefortovo 
prison in Moscow at the latter's request. 
  The newspaper claims that "according to leaked information, 
the exchange of opinions between the two former associates in 
the democratic camp (eds: Khasbulatov was elected parliament 
speaker with solid support from Yeltsin) resembled a dialogue 
between the deaf and the blind".

  [Text] Reliable sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry 
have told Interfax that Andrey Kozyrev has sent a letter to UN 
Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali, in which he returned again to 
the problem of air cover for peacekeeping forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Foreign Minister, the sources said, emphasized in his 
letter that any strikes, even limited ones, are fraught with 
heavy consequences. He is sure this will aggravate the 
situation on all Bosnian fronts and will even jeopardize the UN 
relief operation, because it will make assistance meaningless. 
  Kozyrev believes the decision to use air power in Bosnia is 
solely the prerogative of the UN Secretary-General in 
consultation with the UN Security Council. 
  Speaking about the opening of the airport in Tuzla, Kozyrev 
said that Moscow was sure that only a political solution could 
be effective. 
  The main aim of Russia is the same, said Kozyrev. It is the 
earliest political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this 
plan we fully rely on common sense and the desire of all sides 
to solve the problem politically.

  [Text] United Nations February 10 TASS -- Russia warns of 
serious consequences of air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
notes that all issues connected with the use of air force should 
be settled under the aegis of the U.N. Security Council, says a 
letter by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev addressed to 
U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali circulated as a 
Security Council document here on Wednesday. 
  The Russian minister said that he read with great attention 
the letter of January 28 from the U.N. secretary-general to the 
Security Council president where Butrus-Ghali spelled out 
versions of the use of air force to ensure the rotation of 
troops in Srebrenica and to open the airport in Tuzla. 
  "We regard this letter as an important step aimed at 
fulfilling provisions of appropriate Security Council 
resolutions, which rule that all issues pertaining to the use of 
air force in security areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina and around 
them to help U.N. peace keepers in implementing their mandate, 
are to be settled under the leadership of the Security Council, 
provided there is close cooperation with the U.N. 
secretary-general," Kozyrev noted. 
  He wrote: "Frankly speaking, the very possibility of a force 
cover for opening the airport in Tuzla fills us with misgivings. 
I'd like to explain: We voted for ensuring security for U.N. 
peace keepers and do not preclude a direct air cover for U.N. 
peace keepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina if they are attacked. 
  "However, one should clearly understand that any strikes, 
even if limited within the scope of an air cover, will bring 
about serious consequences. Situation at all the fronts in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina will sharply deteriorate, which will more 
likely result in an end to humanitarian aid and will put into 
jeopardy the entire U.N. operation. 
  "Taking into account far-reaching consequences of possible 
decisions on involving air force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we 
believe as before that their adoption should be an exclusive 
prerogative of the U.N. secretary-general in consultation with 
the U.N. Security Council. You and I have reached a clear 
understanding, as it seems to me, on this point," the Russian 
minister stressed. 
  Kozyrev expressed confidence in the effectiveness of only a 
political solution of the situation concerning the opening of 
the airport in Tuzla and called for "the earliest political 
settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina".

  [Excerpts] Moscow, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin reacted to NATO's ultimatum to Bosnia's Serbs Thursday 
[10 February] by warning that the "cure shouldn't be worse than 
the disease," the daily SEGODNYA reported quoting a presidential 
spokesman. 
  Russia, which disapproves of NATO airstrikes against Bosnian 
Serb positions, as of Thursday morning had not officially 
reacted to the alliance's ultimatum issued overnight. [passage 
omitted] 
  SEGODNYA said Yeltsin discussed the matter over the 
telephone 
Wednesday evening with several western leaders without 
identifying them. [passage omitted] 
  Several Russian diplomats contacted Thursday declined to 
comment on NATO's decision saying it was "too delicate an 
issue." [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile the Russian army's daily newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
reported Thursday that any ultimatum must be addressed to 
Bosnia's three warring factions -- Muslims, Serbs and Croats -- 
and not only the Serbs. 
  "Washington's demands that the Serbs pull back their 
artillery from Sarajevo or face airstrikes are blatantly 
one-sided," the daily said. "This approach will no doubt be 
interpreted by the other party to the conflict as an unspoken 
support."

  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- Russia is proposing that the UN 
Security Council be immediately convened to examine practical 
ways for the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the introduction 
of UN administration there. This was stated at a briefing today 
by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry's Information and Press Department. 
  He said that "Russia proposes that this session be made open 
for the participation in the discussion not only of Security 
Council members but also other interested countries, especially 
those whose interests are in Bosnia and Herzegovina."

  [Text] NATO's decision to launch air strikes on positions 
held by Bosnian Serbs, unless those agree to lift their siege of 
Sarajevo and demilitarize it, has raised many questions, and I 
do not think that Russia can agree with it, First Deputy Foreign 
Minister, Anatoliy Adamishin, told Interfax Thursday morning. 
  Russia's Foreign Ministry, he noted, is drafting a statement 
in connection with NATO's decision. He said he hopes that his 
own "preliminary view" coincides with the content and tone of 
the statement. 
  As Adamishin said, "if nothing changes, Russia will insist 
on 
convening the UN Security Council urgently in order to 'dot all 
the i's' and return the role of peacekeeper to the UN, or press 
for 'peace by force,' if all members of the Security Council 
decide so." According to Russia's first deputy foreign minister, 
this role cannot be transferred to NATO. "Other countries - our 
partners - do not want to convene the Security Council for a 
session," he complained. 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, Russia stands for 
resolving the conflict in Bosnia as soon as possible. "Russia's 
attitude to the acts of violence and massacre in Sarajevo's 
market is as indignant as that of other countries. There is no 
controversy in this. The only issue is how to gain the common 
goal." he said. 
  Today the main problem is how to unblock Sarajevo, 
demilitarize the city and place it under UN administration 
temporarily, Adamishin said. "The Serbs are willing, before a 
comprehensive solution is gained, to single out this question 
and resolve it on the following basis - demilitarize Sarajevo 
and place it under UN administration temporarily. Naturally, 
this should relate to both sides: the Serbs and the Muslims," he 
said. 
  According to the diplomat, NATO's ultimatum raises several 
issues. "Why should NATO resolve settlement problems, in the 
form of an ultimatum at that, and threaten to use military 
methods? This belongs to the competence of the UN, not NATO," 
Adamishin said. 
  He disagreed with the arguments under which the UN 
Secretary- 
General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, "granted NATO the prerogative of 
launching air strikes to unblock Sarajevo." "We do not agree 
with such an interpretation, because it is wrong. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali asked NATO if it is prepared to make its aircraft 
available, if such a need arises. However he never transferred 
UN functions to NATO. This has to be sorted out," Adamishin 
stressed. 
  He also called for considering how NATO's ultimatum will 
affect the Geneva talks attended by spokesmen for all Bosnian 
warring sides which began on Thursday. "How will the talks on 
unblocking Sarajevo proceed, if the Muslims know that this 
ultimatum is hanging over the Serbs, that they will have to 
withdraw their artillery, if they do not want to run the risk of 
being subjected to air strikes? It's clear that the Muslims 
will have no great incentive for reaching agreements," the 
diplomat said. 
  According to him, Bosnian Muslims "have already become 
virtually the main obstacle on the road to settlement, since 
they are preparing for military actions, and are waging military 
actions, particularly with Croats." "They are trying to gain on 
the battlefield what they failed to gain at the negotiating 
table, though at the negotiating table they have gained more 
than they would have gained by fighting. It is clear that 
NATO's decision undermines the agreement that should be 
implemented with the UN participation," Adamishin noted. 
  According to him, NATO's decision was motivated largely by 
the public outcry caused by the heart-rending scenes in Sarajevo 
shown on TV. "However, investigations into that affair have not 
been concluded yet. In the meantime leaks from the UN office 
indicate that the Serbs are not necessarily responsible for it. 
There is no proof of their involvement," Adamishin said. 
  According to him, "there is an impression that NATO's 
decision was taken under a scenario worked out by the U.S., 
France and some other countries, while other nations expressed 
rather serious doubts on this score." "It's natural that we 
shall contact the direct participants. President Boris Yeltsin 
has already sent several messages to President Bill Clinton, 
warning him against the use of military methods. They will not 
only fail to lead to a political solution, but may considerably 
aggravate the situation, make it chaotic, uncontrollable," 
Adamishin said. 
  In the near future the Russian president is to have 
telephone 
conversations with the leaders of Western countries, including 
the U.S. and Germany.

  [Text] Russia's Choice Leader, Yegor Gaydar, believes that 
Russia "must firmly speak against bombardment of Bosnian Serb 
positions in the UN and its Security Council." When answering 
questions privately put to him during a break in the State Duma 
he said he did not exclude that Russia might resort to the veto 
if the Security Council voted on the issue of bombardment. 
  According to Gaydar, "there always exists a temptation to 
interfere into a conflict and to display decisiveness. However, 
this often turns out to be a compensation for an inability to 
see the conflict's roots and to settle it, a compensation for 
one's own political helplessness." 
  "I think that the international community must not take this 
path. Radical unilateral decisions have never brought relief to 
anyone," Gaydar emphasized.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 9 Feb -- In his address in the State Duma 
today, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia [LDPR], said that the possible bombing of 
Serbian positions in Bosnia would be the "beginning of World War 
III." Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's address was connected with his 
recent trip around former Yugoslavia. According to him, 
"millions of Serbs are appealing to Russia for protection." 
  After a brief excursus on the history of that country, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said the people living in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are "a single Orthodox people, some of whom 
at some time were forcibly converted into Islam and Catholicism." 
  In the opinion of the LDPR leader, the only way to resolve 
the Yugoslav problem is to withdraw all foreign military 
contingents and afterward "the people who live there will decide 
for themselves what they should do next." The economic 
sanctions against Belgrade, he thinks, will also fail to achieve 
results. "Children are dying because of them," Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy believes. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy called on the Duma to adopt a 
unanimous 
position on the matter. On behalf of "the party which won the 
elections on 12 December," he said, "the countries whose pilots 
will dare to bomb Serbian positions will be completely 
eliminated." 
  After this statement by the LDPR leader there were numerous 
requests from the audience to switch off Zhirinovskiy's 
microphone. Then he promised all parliamentarians unhappy with 
his address "a trip to the north in the very near future." 
  "Russia's Choice" deputy Viktor Davydkin, who spoke after 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, proposed to the chairman that the 
microphones of those people's elects who take liberties to speak 
"in the tone and style of the LDPR leader" should be switched 
off. 
  In addition, Yuliy Gusman, another "Russia's Choice" deputy, 
addressing Vladimir Zhirinovskiy as "one Orthodox Christian 
addressing another Orthodox Christian," demanded that the latter 
should stop provoking the people's elects and said that, apart 
from the LDPR leader, "there are a lot of loud-voiced and 
boorish deputies in the audience ready to give a proper rebuff 
to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy." Yuliy Gusman also promised Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy that it would be him who would go to the north "in 
the very near future, together with his relatives."

  [Text] The faction of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Concord (PRUC) [PRES] in the State Duma has stated that air 
strikes on the positions of any of the warring sides to the 
Bosnian conflict are unacceptable and extremely dangerous. 
  In its statement published today, PRUC pointed out that 
local 
conditions of Bosnia-Herzegovina allow to make air strikes 
neither limited, nor selective. "The tragedy on a market place 
in Sarajevo will be repeated over and over again as a result of 
the strikes," the statement stipulates. 
  A total of 68 people died as a result of the mortar attack 
on 
a market place in Sarajevo. 
  Moreover, NATO forces' direct involvement in the hostilities 
will lead to further escalation of violence and virtually the 
trigger "internationalization" of the armed conflict which is 
fraught with unpredictable consequences, the document points out. 
  The PRUC faction stated that if the UN Security Council 
approves air strikes on Sarajevo, the Russian representative 
must use his right to veto the decision. 
  PRUC also believes that the Russian president and government 
should take immediate measures to prevent the Bosnian crisis 
from turning into a larger war.

  [Text] The decision on "the utilization of NATO military 
forces in Yugoslavia" will be invalid since it "cannot be 
supported by Russia as the permanent member of the UN Security 
Council." This was said in the statement by the 
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin faction (leader Yavlinskiy) in the 
State Duma published on Wednesday. The statement points out 
that "involvement of the NATO military-political bloc into an 
armed conflict beyond NATO's sphere may break the 
military-political balance in Europe and contradicts Russia's 
national interests." 
  According to the faction's deputies, the lifting of the 
embargo on military deliveries to Bosnia and Herzegovina would 
inevitably make non-European forces (Muslim states) get involved 
into the conflict. The statement underlined that such actions 
could cause a serious domestic problem within the Russian 
Federation - a split between Christian and Moslem peoples. 
  The faction's statement emphasized that it was 
"non-productive" to continue implementation of the economic 
sanctions against the new Yugoslavia since Yugoslavian civilians 
and the economy of the neighboring states were the first victims 
of these sanctions. In connection with this, the 
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin faction insists on the lifting or 
"gradual softening" of the sanctions against Yugoslavia (which 
now consists of Serbia and Montenegro-IF note), which does not 
directly participate in the war.

  [Text] Moscow February 10 TASS -- The Yabloko parliamentary 
group in the State Duma, which includes a number of influential 
politicians like, for example, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Vladimir 
Lukin and Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, believes that the decision to 
use NATO troops in Yugoslavia is illegal, because it cannot be 
supported by Russia which is a permanent member of the U.N. 
Security Council. 
  The Yabloko group adopted a statement saying that "the 
drawing of the NATO military-political bloc into an armed 
conflict outside the NATO boundaries is fraught with the 
upsetting of a military-political balance in Europe." They 
stressed that such involvement in the Yugoslav crisis "runs 
counter to the national and state interests of Russia." 
  The Yabloko group is sure that the search for a peaceful way 
of settling the Yugoslav conflict should be supported and 
continued. The Yabloko group urged Russia to play a more active 
political role in that conflict and, at the same time, warned 
against being drawn into it. In the opinion of its members, "a 
gradual peaceful settlement may be reached by the tested 
methods, suggested by the London Conference."

  [Text] The chain of bloody events in Sarajevo is egging on 
the world community to engage in more resolute intervention, the 
aim and forms of which remain contradictory in appearance. To 
"punish" one of the warring sides in the tripartite civil war is 
odious. To attempt do this by air strikes, even "surgical" 
strikes, in a country seemingly created for carrying out 
guerrilla wars on the ground is worse than stupidity. So what 
can be done? 
  The photograph shows the spot in Sarajevo where six children 
died from a mine explosion at the end of January. The Muslim 
authorities accused the Serbs, while the Serbs accused Muslim 
fanatics who, according to them, are killing their own people in 
an attempt to get Serbian positions bombed. That very day 
Bosnian Government head Haris Silajdzic called for air strikes. 
In a letter to the UN and NATO secretaries general he asked: 
"What else has to happen before the UN resolutions (on the use 
of aircraft in Bosnia -- S.S.) are finally carried out?" 
  The next bloody tragedy was not long in coming -- 68 people 
were killed and around 200 wounded in one of Sarajevo's crowded 
marketplaces. Some people are trying with brutal methodicalness 
to embroil the United Nations and NATO in the Bosnian chaos. 
They are bent not so much even on provoking air strikes "to get 
the siege of Sarajevo lifted" as on embroiling them precisely in 
the war. It is clear to anyone with the slightest knowledge of 
the real situation that if NATO aircraft start bombing Serbian 
positions around the city it will not be possible to avoid heavy 
civilian casualties. It will be extremely difficult to hold back 
well armed detachments of Serbs by discipline alone and under a 
single command. Groups of "avengers" will start "punishing" UN 
soldiers, who will overnight have been transformed from neutral 
forces into military adversaries... 
  Moreover, "lifing the siege of Sarajevo" is a purely 
superficial pretext. To achieve this you need sufficient 
goodwill on the part of the warring sides. The Serbs have 
already stated that they are ready to hand Sarajevo over to UN 
control, given security guarantees for the Serbian part of the 
the city. Paradoxical as it may seem at first sight, the Muslim 
leadership has a different perspective on the problem of lifting 
the siege. Not so long ago Rasim Delic, the commander of the 
Bosnian Muslim Army, let drop the following remark in 
conversation with local journalists: "It is of no advantage to 
us at all to break through the encirclement, for more than half 
the population of the city will then leave." 
  The Delic plan, which has been referred to many times in the 
press, is to increase the scale of the war, to carry it into the 
territory of Croatia and Serbia (Kosovo), to upgrade the 
200,000-strong Muslim army's weapons by getting the arms embargo 
on Bosnia lifted, and to exact military revenge on the 
battlefield. The threat this poses to the Balkans is well known 
from history. Fortunately, NATO contains enough level-headed 
politicians who are conscious of the potential consequences of 
simple solutions in Bosnia such as bombing the Serbian guns 
around Sarajevo and who are ready patiently to seek ways that 
are actually capable of leading to a settlement of the very 
complex Bosnian problem. 
  On Wednesday the North Atlantic bloc have the opportunity to 
propose such a way. It will consider a French proposal which 
chimes with the recent Russian initiative and amounts to putting 
pressure on all three Bosnian sides rather than just the Serbian 
one. NATO members will probably agree to demand that both 
Serbian and Muslim heavy armaments be placed under UN control 
within one month. So we will very quickly be able to see for 
ourselves who seeks peace and who wants to prolong the war.

"William Perry, Scientist and Secretary"] 
  [Excerpts] A few days ago the U.S. Senate unanimously 
approved President Clinton's nomination of 66-year-old William 
Perry for the post of defense secretary. This unanimity can 
easily be explained because throughout his career Perry has been 
closely associated with the Pentagon and has been widely 
recognized as an effective leader of major corporations in the 
military industry, and he is an eminent mathematical scientist 
and arms control specialist. [passage omitted] 
  The new defense secretary believes that the department he 
heads "must play an important role in strengthening democracy," 
because the U.S. military complex "can help peoples to 
appreciate more fully the principles and advantages of civilian 
control over the military department" by means of direct 
programs of cooperation with various countries' defense 
ministries. As we know, such a program is now being implemented 
together with Russia. 
  In his recent speeches Perry has stressed that democracy 
"has 
bided its time and has proved stronger than the most powerful 
armies." The advantages of democracy "are appreciated by 
everyone who believes in peace and freedom," but at the same 
time it must be borne in mind that "the collapse of Soviet 
communism has by no means removed the sources of the threat to 
our security." 
  Judging from these statements the new secretary intends to 
stick to the traditional U.S. defense policy of "keeping its 
powder dry," even in a favorable international climate, by 
maintaining a level of combat capability ensuring its national 
security interests whatever turn events in the world may take. 
  This is evidenced by the Pentagon's draft budget for the 
next 
fiscal year, which Perry has just submitted to Congress, for 
$263.7 billion -- this is $2.4 billion more than last year. 
This draft provides for the appropriation of large sums for the 
development and production of high-technology armaments, 
including a new aircraft carrier, the F-22 fighter, the V-22 
combat helicopter, and a new generation of submarines.

"The West Pretends..."] 
  [Text] If we were to gather together all the Western 
statesmen's assurances of support for the reforms in Russia and 
of assistance in restructuring and stabilizing its economy, we 
would get maybe not just one but several fat volumes. Really. 
Here is U.S. President Bill Clinton saying in his keynote 
statement to Congress: "The best way to ensure lasting peace is 
to promote the development of democracy in the world. This is 
why we support the reforming democrats in Russia and other 
states of the former Soviet bloc." Here is Warren Christopher, 
leader of the U.S. foreign policy department, solemnly 
proclaiming: "We believe that the aid programs for Russia must 
continue to be implemented. We will urge international 
financial institutions to give it warranted and expedient 
support." Here is an official statement by Richard Dyuke 
[surname as transliterated], spokesman for the French Foreign 
Ministry: "Nobody in the West casts any doubt on the further 
granting of economic aid and the allocation of credits to 
Russia." Here is.... 
  But it is obviously pointless to continue listing such 
statements. They are innumerable. Just as there are 
innumerable alluring promises of financial and other aid. 
According to the estimates of the authoritative OECD, Russia 
was promised $24 billion in 1992 and even $43 billion in 1993! 
  These promises were recorded in very serious documents -- 
the 
decisions of the G-7 (the leaders of the world's seven most 
developed states), the IMF, the World Bank, and the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Russia's bilateral 
agreements with a number of states. In fact, however, most of 
these -- let us be frank -- highly impressive promises have 
remained just declarations not backed up by deeds. For example, 
of the aid package to the tune of $28 billion which the G-7 
countries alone intended to give to Russia in 1993, in fact 
just...$4 billion was allocated. The IMF, whose share in the 
Western aid for Russia was to have amounted to $14 billion, in 
practice gave just $2.5 billion. 
  This policy made the well known U.S. commentator J. Hoagland 
resort to the following comparison in one of his articles. 
"Soviet workers," he wrote, "used to joke that the government 
pretends to pay them, while they pretend to work. Today the 
West pretends to give aid to Yeltsin in Russia, who in turn 
pretends to implement reforms." 
  Let us leave on Hoagland's conscience the claim that reforms 
are not being implemented in Russia. But it is true that the 
West is pretending more than helping. It is sufficient to 
recall that in 1992, for example, the volume of aid from the 
United States and Japan in respect of all the countries of the 
former Soviet bloc did not exceed one-hundredth of 1 percent of 
the U.S. and Japanese GNP. France and Britain also confined 
themselves to scraps. Germany alone stands out. It granted 
Russia $3.9 billion -- over five times as much as the United 
States. These are data for 1992. The final results have not yet 
been summed up for 1993. But it is already known that there 
will be no fundamental differences compared with the preceding 
period. 
  It would not be out of place to take a look at what the 
funds 
which actually have been allocated give to Russia. Take the 
following fact. In 1993 the United States extended to our 
country credit of $700 million to buy grain over 15 years. But 
at the same time it stipulated that 75 percent of the shipments 
of this grain across the ocean had to be made on U.S. ships and, 
moreover, at highly inflated tariffs (whereas it costs 
$15,000-17,000 a day to charter a Liberian ship, a U.S. one 
costs $25,000-30,000). Thus, in fact almost all the $700 
million goes to U.S. grain producers and shipowners. Russia 
gets the debt (and the interest on the debt). 
  It should also be emphasized that credit is frequently 
hedged about with all kinds of conditions which quite often go 
beyond the generally accepted framework of relations between 
equal partners. These conditions can be divided into several 
groups. 
  The first group is political. The lenders (for it is not 
usually a question of funds provided gratis but precisely of 
loans for a particular term and at a particular, sometimes very 
high, rate of interest) advance demands that Russia implement 
its reforms from a certain standpoint and at a certain pace, 
sometimes disregarding internal conditions and the country's 
national interests. Moreover, although people in the West like 
to say that aid is given in the hope of continuing the policy of 
democratic reforms and not with a view to individual 
personalities, in practice it is frequently possible to hear 
"recommendations" as to who must and who must not be a member of 
the government, for instance. The political conditions also 
include attempts to tell Russia how to deal with close neighbors 
and what it can and cannot reach agreement with them about. 
  The second group of conditions is exclusively economic. The 
IMF is particularly bad in this regard. The IMF makes the 
allocation of funds conditional on permissible -- in its view -- 
levels of inflation, pace of privatization, and other criteria 
which undoubtedly relate to the internal competence of sovereign 
states. Naturally, the IMF takes no responsibility for the 
consequences of fulfilling its conditions, which it prefers to 
call recommendations. 
  The third group of conditions relates to the desire to 
hinder 
Russia's access to world markets and to undermine the 
competitiveness of its exports. There are more than enough 
facts here. There is a mass of artificial obstacles to exports 
of Russian uranium, although you would think that all the 
agreements on this had been reached long ago. There is the 
demand to reduce Russian aluminum exports by half a million 
tonnes. There are the obstacles to Russia's involvement in 
commercial launches of spacecraft. And much, much more besides. 
  When speaking of all these conditions, finally I cannot fail 
to mention the direct blackmail to which Western countries 
sometimes resort. I have already spoken of the numerous 
assurances that Russia will be given very broad assistance and 
support. But I could also cite many statements threatening to 
end all assistance. "The United States could revise its policy 
of giving aid to Moscow if the Russian Government embarks on a 
path of slowing the process of economic reforms," the CHRISTIAN 
SCIENCE MONITOR pointed out, citing officials in the Washington 
administration. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has disseminated 
a report that the G-7 countries might not agree to the proposal 
to include Russia among the full participants in their annual 
meetings, although only recently this idea was being discussed 
actively. 
  Such a policy toward present-day Russia can only be called 
shortsighted. What our country needs is not mythical "aid" -- 
hedged about, moreover, with a mass of conditions -- but 
equitable cooperation with Western states and broad access to 
world markets, where in an honest competitive struggle Russian 
producers would be able both to show and to see for themselves 
what they are worth. Precisely this idea was championed by 
Russia's representatives at the recent World Economic Forum in 
Davos. 
  With or without the support of Western countries Russia 
will, 
all the same, go its own way. But in the former case this path 
would be easier and less painful. And not only for us. For 
Western countries too. They would not need to fear 
unpredictable turns in Russian politics. 
  Instead of just pretending to help us, it is in the 
interests 
of the West itself to go over to full cooperation with Russia. 
It is in our interests to continue our reforms still more 
consistently, only far more sensibly than hitherto. Not 
rejecting assistance from elsewhere, but not putting too much 
trust in it either.

  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- "The Russian-Ukrainian talks took 
place in a constructive atmosphere. There was a creative and 
active examination of those issues that could open up the way to 
implementation of everything agreed by the presidents of the 
Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the United States at their 
tripartite meeting in January this year." Yuriy Dubinin, the 
head of the Russian Federation state delegation to the talks 
with Ukraine, said this in an exclusive interview with the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  "As a result of the talks a package of documents on this 
matter was agreed. The drafts of these documents are now being 
submitted to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine. We have an 
understanding with our Ukrainian colleagues that until the 
presidents consider and, we hope, endorse these documents, we 
will not reveal the details of these agreements." On the whole, 
however, Yuriy Dubinin stressed, "these agreements are highly 
positive and promising."

Commentaries" rubric: "The Skrunda Radar Station Could Be 
Retained for Four More Years. A Qualitatively New Point Has 
Been Reached in the Russian-Latvian Talks"] 
  [Text] Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, told 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that the 7 February meeting with 
Martins Virsis, his Latvian colleague, was highly productive. 
It makes it possible to say that we are approaching a 
qualitatively new point in the talks, since one of the most 
difficult problems -- the period of operation of the radar 
station at Skrunda after the Russian troop withdrawal from 
Latvia -- has been removed. An accord was reached at the level 
of the delegations that the radar station will be retained for 
four more years, with 18 months being allocated thereafter to 
dismantle it. 
  The delegation heads believe that all other questions could 
also be resolved in the very near future. Thus, Sergey Zotov 
stated, if in the very near future the Latvian Government 
approves the accord that has been reached on the radar station, 
then the way will be opened up to signing an entire package of 
treaties and agreements connected with the troop withdrawal. 
  As is known, Russia links the signing of the main treaty on 
the troop withdrawal with agreement on the radar station and on 
social protection for military pensioners. An accord has been 
reached on the Skrunda installation, and a second agreement is 
practically ready, although a number of recent statements by the 
Russian foreign minister on questions of relations with the 
Baltic countries have caused the Latvian Government to waver on 
certain points of the agreement, but in Sergey Zotov's opinion, 
this is still no reason to jeopardize the whole package of 
treaties and agreements that have been worked out. It will 
obviously become clear whether or not this is so as early as 
14-17 February in Riga, where the next round of the 
Russian-Latvian talks will be held. 
  Talking with Sergey Zotov, I could not fail to touch on the 
fact of the reelection of Andrejs Rucs, who was to blame for the 
10 January incident involving two Russian generals, to the post 
of chief of the council of Riga's Vidzeme suburb. "In this 
connection we expressed concern to the head of the Latvian state 
delegation," Sergey Zotov replied. "He informed us that the 
republic General Prosecutor's Office is submitting for the 
Saeima's consideration a corresponding proposal to create a 
legal basis for Rucs' removal from the post and the institution 
of criminal proceedings."

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Charodeyev report: "Riga Has Allowed Moscow To </F>
Keep Its Radar Station at Skrunda"] 
  [Text] The latest round of talks which has ended between 
Russian and Latvian state delegations has resulted in a package 
of documents which has been prepared for signing, concerning the 
Russian troop withdrawal from Latvian territory. 
  Answering questions from IZVESTIYA's correspondent, 
Ambassador Sergey Zotov, leader of the Russian delegation, 
recalled that in 1993 we withdrew our troops from Lithuania 
without a corresponding treaty being drawn up. Our Latvian and 
Estonian partners in talks were tempted to follow that option. 
But they forget that at the time Vilnius farsightedly accepted 
Moscow's terms, which provided for guarantees for the rights of 
the Russian-speaking population to be observed. 
  For a long time the Russian diplomats' efforts consisted in 
convincing the Latvian side of the hopelessness of such an 
approach and making efforts to lead the talks out of the impasse 
in which they found themselves. Moscow and Riga wasted several 
months on this. According to Sergey Zotov, however, significant 
progress became apparent in the talks in January. 
  Today a start has been made on the legal-treaty formulation 
of not only the Russian troop withdrawal but also the agreements 
concerning social protection for servicemen and military 
pensioners in Latvia, the legal status of a Russian strategic 
installation -- the radar station in the city of Skrunda -- and 
the conditions of its operation. 
  With regard to the radar station's period of existence, the 
Russian diplomat pointed out that the Skrunda station will 
function for four more years. In addition, S. Zotov reported, 
an additional 18 months are allocated for dismantling it. 
Naturally, these periods have to be confirmed by the 
governments of Latvia and Russia, but Moscow considers this a 
reasonable compromise. 
  "Thus," the Russian ambassador concluded, "we will be left 
with small technical questions, and after resolving them in the 
very near future we plan to open up the way to completing all 
the work on a package of agreements, so as to submit it to the 
two countries' governments for signing." 
  Sergey Zotov expressed the assumption that the Russian 
Government will receive the agreements elaborated in the talks 
for approval by the end of February.

party of peace, to which I attribute myself, on the other hand, 
intends to build friendly relations with all states of the

<F P=106> [Ignat Lebedyakin report: "Andrey Kozyrev Has Decided Not </F>
To Make a Scandal. Uzbek TV Provoked It Later On"] 
  [Text] Yesterday morning the Ostankino TV channel twice 
went off the air on Uzbekistan territory. Subjected to 
censorship were news bulletins which contained, among other 
things, footage about Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's 
visit to Tashkent. This scandalous fact is most eloquent 
testimony to the results of the Russian-Uzbek talks, whose main 
agenda item was the situation of the republic's Russian-speaking 
population. 
  It will be recalled that a not very pleasant incident 
occurred in Tashkent last November with the participation of the 
same actors: Attempts were twice made to prove to Kozyrev that 
the line at the Russian Federation Embassy did not include 
Uzbekistan citizens. This time the minister, prior to the talks 
with his Uzbek counterpart, deemed it prudent to meet with 
representatives of the Russian community who had gathered near 
the embassy gate. According to INTERFAX, his fellow countrymen 
complained to the minister about the difficulties involved in 
leaving the country and the impossibility of selling their 
housing, also citing acts of discrimination. 
  The press statement that Kozyrev made at the end of the 
negotiations sounds extremely flaccid [vyalyy] and is hardly 
capable of instilling hope. "It seems that the element of 
mutual misunderstanding has lessened," the minister told 
journalists. "The problems are acute but we discuss them in a 
constructive key, without mutual hysteria." Kozyrev also added 
that he does not belong "among those statesmen who expect the 
discussion of the issue of Russian-speakers' rights to generate 
a scandal and who are themselves pouring fuel on the fire, 
trying to gain some additional points." This text markedly 
differs from the reciprocal eulogies that were heard two weeks 
ago in Bishkek. In fact this is the limit of diplomatic 
courteousness, which is usually followed by a protest note. 
Confidential sources in the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry 
say that the Central Asian leaders are exerting most heavy 
pressure on Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev, considering his 
position on the issue of dual nationality to be too soft. There 
is every reason to believe that Islam Karimov is among such 
leaders.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "The Guideline </F>
Is Russia's Interests. Russian Federation Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev on the New Tasks of Russian Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] Russian diplomacy has entered the new year, 1994, 
with a wide agenda for both the immediate and medium term. 
  The consistent orientation of our foreign policy toward the 
promotion of national interests through openness and cooperation 
with the outside world strengthens Russia's positions in the 
international arena and creates a favorable climate for internal 
development. At the same time the end of the Cold War certainly 
does not mean that international relations have become idyllic. 
The emerging multipolar world is in many ways more complex and 
unpredictable than the old bipolar world. Instead of two rival 
blocs there exist many "centers of influence" with different and 
sometimes competing interests. New threats to our interests are 
appearing, above all in connection with instability and armed 
conflict in the area of the former USSR. 
  In these conditions we are faced with the task of 
energetically -- and where necessary, uncompromisingly -- 
defending and promoting our interests, while, of course, 
remaining within the bounds of international law and the search 
for a rational balance of interests. 
  In order to carry out this policy we need a robust 
democratic 
state system. The new Russian Constitution creates the 
necessary prerequisites for this. Foreign policy remains in the 
president's hands, which rules out its invasion by 
manifestations of adventurism and self-interest. 
  In the practical sphere we shall operate in the following 
main areas. 
  In the past two years Russia has concluded dozens of 
bilateral treaties and agreements, joined the key international 
economic organizations, and acquired a whole series of partners 
in various regions of the world. Now these accords must be 
given substance. This is not a departmental, but a statewide 
task. 
  In the sphere of national security our priorities will be, 
as 
before, to eliminate hotbeds of armed conflict along Russia's 
borders, to reinforce the arrangements relating to the 
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the latest 
military technologies, and to increase the accountabilty and 
transparency of the international arms trade, while 
unconditionally safeguarding our commercial interests in this 
sphere. 
  The START II treaty and the Convention on the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons need to be brought into force. The former 
Supreme Soviet ducked out of ratifying these important 
disarmament treaties. I hope that the Federal Assembly will 
approach this question with more responsibility and with less 
prejudice, especially as it is a question of an important phase 
of the implementation of Russia's new military doctrine. The 
agreement between the Russian Federation, the United States, and 
Ukraine on the total elimination of strategic nuclear weapons on 
Ukrainian territory signed in Moscow creates a favorable climate 
for the ratification of the START II treaty. 
  We will concentrate our efforts on the all-around 
development 
of the CIS and its speedy transformation into a full-fledged 
regional organization with an increasing level of economic 
integration and political cooperation. The opportunities 
presented by the Russian chairmanship of the Commonwealth in the 
first half of this year will be actively exploited to achieve 
this task. 
  The defense of the rights of the Russian-speaking 
population remains of paramount importance. In 1992-1993 the 
government was forced to spend 51.5 billion rubles on catering 
for refugees and persons forced to emigrate from regions of 
interethnic tension and conflict. Hence not only humanitarian 
principles, but also the country's pragmatic interests oblige us 
to ensure that UN and CSCE standards in the sphere of human and 
national minority rights are genuinely observed in the CIS and 
the Baltic region. It is important to speed up the "launch" of 
Commonwealth human rights protection mechanisms -- first and 
foremost a CIS Commission for Human Rights. 
  Russia finds equally unacceptable both "neo-imperialist" and 
isolationist approaches to problems in the former USSR, where we 
find concentrated not only our vital interests but also the main 
sources of threats to these interests and, at the same time, 
great opportunities for cooperation. Russia objectively carries 
a special responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in 
this huge area. We will persistently seek to increase the CIS' 
peace-making potential and to further cooperation in 
strengthening its external borders. Special attention will be 
devoted to conflict regions and to Tajikistan, where dialogue 
between the government and the political opposition must finally 
get started. 
  In the European sphere our central task is to participate in 
building a peaceful, democratic, united Europe. The main 
instrument in the political sphere is to be the CSCE, and in the 
military sphere, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC], 
which could act as the coordinator of the work of the regional 
organizations of NATO, the Western European Union, and the CIS 
in the sphere of maintaining peace and strengthening stability 
in Europe, increasing the openness of military activity, and 
carrying out conversion of the military-industrial complex. An 
important stage in the creation of a security system in Europe 
will be the forthcoming regular CSCE summit in Budapest this 
year. 
  The "Partnership for Peace" concept adopted by NATO in 
Brussels was a major incentive to dialogue on these problems. 
Displaying a responsible approach, our partners did not succumb 
to the temptation of "quick-fix" solutions to security problems 
and did not opt for the extension of NATO membership to the 
East, which was fraught with the danger of provoking a new split 
in Europe. Instead of this, emphasis was placed on developing 
cooperation with all states on an equal basis. It is important 
now that we not only do not lag behind other countries, but move 
more quickly than they on the road of establishing genuine 
partnership, above all in the military area. Otherwise the 
isolation of Russia, which we managed to avoid on the political 
level, could occur on the practical level. 
  At the same time Russian diplomacy is not limited to just 
the 
partnership for peace option. We are promoting wider and more 
far reaching initiatives for the formation of the new Europe, 
including the extension of the NACC to include the neutral 
states of Europe, and also in the area of offering Central 
European countries interlocking security guarantees from Russia 
and several of our West European partners. 
  In the sphere of bilateral relations with the leading West 
European states we will continue top-level dialogue with the 
FRG, France, Britain, and Spain. We hope in the near future to 
complete talks with the European Union on an agreement on 
partnership and cooperation. 
  Russia will continue to develop relations with the countries 
of Central and East Europe on a new basis. We start from the 
premise that the common interests of our countries as regards 
democratic reforms, transition to effective market economies, 
and the preservation of traditional ties between our peoples 
significantly outweigh old grievances and suspicions. In recent 
years the treaty-legal basis of our relations with the majority 
of Central and East European countries has been radically 
renewed. We expect to complete this process by drafting 
political treaties with Romania and Albania. Russia will 
continue to participate actively in the search for a settlement 
to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. To the extent that 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia complies with UN demands, we will 
seek to have the sanctions against this country rescinded and to 
restore its status in the United Nations and other international 
organizations. 
  The visits to Moscow of U.S. President B. Clinton and Vice 
President A. Gore consolidated the aim of moving toward mature 
partnership in Russian-U.S. relations. Now the task is to 
exploit to the full the newly opened opportunities for 
cooperation in the political, economic, scientific and 
technical, and other spheres. 
  An important step toward lifting restrictions on our 
foreign economic relations will be the forthcoming abolition of 
COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] 
in spring 1994. The creation of new international arrangements 
for monitoring trading in arms and "dual" technologies 
presupposes the participation of Russia -- a major producer of 
arms and military "know-how." 
  New steps will be made to bring Russia closer to the G-7. 
Following the Tokyo meeting between B.N. Yeltsin and the G-7 
leaders our dialogue with the G-7 has acquired a regular, 
working character. A G-7 mission in Moscow has been set up, and 
our diplomats and financiers participate in meetings with its 
experts. At the forthcoming G-7 summit in Naples Russia intends 
to propose beginning the practical transformation of this 
formation into a G-8, starting with the political sphere. 
  An important foreign policy task is the use in Russia's 
interests of its unique position as a Eurasian power. In recent 
years we have managed to a significant degree to pave the way to 
large-scale cooperation with leading Asian states -- India, 
China, Japan -- and also to begin developing relations with new 
partners (South Korea and the countries of ASEAN and the Persian 
Gulf). Now these new opportunites in the sphere of economic and 
scientific and technical cooperation must be exploited. The 
strategic guideline in the Asia-Pacific region is the effective 
incorporation of he regions of Siberia and the Far East in 
international cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The promotion of our interests in the southern direction is 
linked above all with ensuring stability there and removing 
hotbeds of tension. We will actively pursue the course of 
neutralizing threats to the security of Russia and the 
Commonwealth countries and opposing religious extremism and 
aggressive nationalism. 
  Russia is deeply committed to the settlement of the Near 
East 
problem. Our efforts will center on continuing, in close 
collaboration with the United States, Russia's role as a 
cosponsor of the peace process and on helping to promote the 
realization of the aspirations of the Palestinian people. We 
will seek to develop broad economic cooperation with countries 
of the Arab world with the aim of involving their financial 
resources in the economic modernization of Russia and 
consolidating its positions on world markets, including the arms 
market. 
  Our relations with the countries of Latin America, with many 
of whom we have interesting experience in the economic, 
technological, and other spheres, will be stepped up. 
  Continuing our course toward developing cooperation with the 
countries of Africa, Russia will maintain its active involvement 
in the settlement processes under UN auspices in Somalia, 
Angola, and Mozambique. 
  In the sphere of multilateral diplomacy we will 
energetically 
promote the strengthening of the United Nations. We will seek a 
model for reforming this organization -- including its Security 
Council -- which leads to the increase of the effectiveness of 
the United Nations as the leading institution of international 
cooperation. Our priorities are to involve the United Nations 
in actively supporting Russia's peace-making activity and 
protecting human and national minority rights, and also the 
rights of the victims of armed conflicts. 
  The "domestic" agenda of Russian diplomats' work also 
promises to be extensive. One important avenue of this work is 
to offer support to Russian regions entering into direct 
international relations. In recent times, with Russia's active 
cooperation, a whole series of cooperation structures have been 
set up in the region of the Baltic, the Black Sea, and the 
Barents Sea/Euroarctic region. Now the most difficult task 
remains -- to ensure that the mechanisms of cooperation that 
have been set up genuinely start to work for the specific 
socioeconomic needs of wide areas of Russia. This has special 
significance for our Northwest region, which until recently was 
completely isolated from the outside world by a veil of secrecy. 
Now the state must repay its debt to the Russian North. The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to continue to actively help 
Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Oblasts and Karelia to establish direct 
links with business partners in Scandinavia and West Europe. 
  In implementing its foreign policy the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs counts on constructive collaboration with the new 
Russian parliament. We expect the Federal Assembly to play an 
active part in the formation of a legislative basis for Russia's 
foreign policy activity.

  [Text] International sanctions can be taken against the 
DPRK. If Pyongyang does not accept the international inspection 
of its nuclear cites before 21 February, sanctions can follow, 
said ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu. A Board of Governors 
meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will be 
held on 21 February in Vienna. The meeting is expected to adopt 
a resolution on sanctions to be referred to the UN Security 
Council for deliberation. In this connection, station 
commentator Valeriy Surikov writes: 
  The situation on the Korean peninsula is deteriorating these 
days. The three parties, namely, Washington, Seoul, and 
Pyongyang, are responsible for it. For instance, the United 
States and the ROK are planning to resume the Team Spirit--the 
large-scale annual joint military exercise--this year. 
Pyongyang regards the Team Spirit ROK-U.S. joint military 
exercise as an exercise aimed at northward invasion. 
Furthermore, the Pentagon is attempting to deploy Patriot 
anti-missile missiles in the ROK and even to bring back tactical 
nuclear weapons there. This attempt will only adversely affect 
the situation on the Korean peninsula, giving rise to a very 
negative reaction from the Pyongyang side. 
  In the meantime, the measures taken by Pyongyang these days 
are not contributing to the alleviation of tension either. 
Pyongyang made a principled promise last December that it would 
permit international inspection of its nuclear sites. 
Nevertheless, the IAEA has not received a reply on 
materializing the nuclear inspection. Moreover, the DPRK stated 
that it could withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
and give up negotiations with the IAEA by reason of the Team 
Spirit military exercise. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has recently 
issued a statement clarifying the Russian position. Moscow 
claims that since there is still an opportunity to resolve the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by diplomatic means, the 
problem should be solved through talks. 
  Not many days are left before 21 February. However, all the 
parties concerned have enough time to ponder about the right and 
wrong of the problem. There is still time and opportunity to 
find a reasonable solution. It is time they fully operated the 
institution of talks, rather than of pressure.

<F P=106> [From the "Today's World" program] </F>
  [Text] The DPRK thinks that it cannot reach agreement with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] at present. 
DPRK's senior representative at the IAEA made public a 
statement to this effect. 
  Although a statement of this nature is made adding to the 
skeptic atmosphere for the solution of the nuclear problem on 
the Korean peninsula, there are also statements which add to an 
optimistic mood for it, says station commentator (Aleksey 
Kondrachev). 
  For instance, in his verbal message to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, DPRK President Kim Il-song noted that the DPRK does not 
intend to develop nuclear weapons. However, the world community 
cannot dispel suspicion of Pyongyang's nuclear program. The 
suspicion of the nuclear program remains unresolved because the 
North does not permit international inspection of its nuclear 
sites. 
  Although the DPRK is holding talks with the IAEA, the talks 
are falling into a stalemate again. The talks are coming to a 
blind alley which could bring a disadvantageous result to 
Pyongyang, because in 12 days the IAEA is supposed to disclose a 
report on the result of its talks with the DPRK. If no progress 
is made in the talks, the United Nations could take sanctions on 
the DPRK. 
  The delegates of some countries, including Russia, think 
that 
the countries should not put enormous pressure on Pyongyang, 
thus driving it into a corner. The economic and political 
sanctions will not be able to change the Pyongyang position 
easily. If sanctions are taken, followed by such steps as 
(?economic embargo), it could further stiffen the DPRK stance on 
the nuclear issue. 
  Suggestion is, therefore, made that dialogue be carried on 
between the DPRK and the United States, between the DPRK and the 
IAEA, and between the North and the South. This is the best 
way, as noted by delegates from many countries. The ROK 
president also called for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. The issue of denuclearizing the 
Korean peninsula should, in the first place, be a task to be 
resolved by the people of the North and the South themselves. 
Hence, inter-Korean dialogue should be resumed as soon as 
possible.

<F P=106> [Viktor Pritula Commentary: "There Will Be No Change of </F>
Priorities"] 
  [Text] Hanoi -- Thirty years after the beginning of the 
aggression in Vietnam, the U.S. Administration has announced the 
lifting of the economic embargo against Hanoi. This is 
unquestionably an historic event, as was shown by the 
unprecedented number of foreign journalists and diplomats who 
attended the press conference given by Le Mai, Vietnamese deputy 
foreign minister. 
  However, despite the significance of Clinton's decision, it 
aroused no undue euphoria in Vietnam. Deputy Minister Le Mai, 
who read out the Vietnamese Government statement, stressed that 
Vietnam welcomes this move, which it considers important and 
useful both for the peoples of the two countries and for the 
cause of peace in the region. Answering journalists' questions 
afterwards, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the lifting of the 
embargo will have no effect on the foreign policy doctrine of 
Vietnam, which advocates the development of relations with all 
countries in the interests of peace and cooperation. In other 
words, a cardinal shift of priorities is not on the cards. 
  But Vietnam does have its priorities. After the collapse of 
the socialist community and the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union Vietnam turned firmly toward the Asia and Pacific region. 
Last year there was a perceptible economic rapprochement with 
the West European countries, too. Thus Vietnam's integration 
into the system of world economic cooperation has begun without 
any participation by the superpowers, one of which meanwhile 
lost that status while the other continued to maintain its 
anti-Vietnam embargo. 
  When President Clinton asserts that the lifting of the 
embargo is dictated solely by a desire to speed up and complete 
the solution of the problem of Americans missing in action 
during the Indochina war, there is a definite element of 
craftiness in his words. The Vietnamese leadership has 
repeatedly stressed that the solution of this problem on 
Vietnam's part is purely humanitarian in character and has no 
political or economic motives. The search for the remains of 
the U.S. MIA's would have continued regardless of the lifting or 
extension of the embargo. 
  In the opinion of many analysts the lifting of the embargo 
was dictated more by the economic interests of U.S. business, 
for whom Vietnam is the key to Indochina. The dynamic 
development of the Vietnamese economy, which is far from 
overheating, the pragmatism of that country's leadership, its 
great natural and human resources, and, most important, absolute 
political stability make Vietnam one of the most attractive 
targets for foreign investors today. 
  Vietnam is available for cooperation with America. But it 
must be mutually beneficial cooperation, not one that is 
conditioned by any political requirements. I was told that by 
the leaders of Hanoi enterprises with whom I have talked in the 
past few days. They stressed that they are not expecting 
miracles from Washington. In the opinion of some Vietnamese 
directors it would be naive, not to say stupid, to change the 
economic priorities today. America is a superpower of course, 
my interlocutors said, but in the economic sphere there are 
other superpowers, such as Japan in Asia. There are also the 
new Asian "tigers," whose rapprochement with Vietnam is evident. 
In January the Japanese granted Vietnam a credit of 0.5 billion 
[currency not specified] on preferential terms and they are now 
first among its trading partners. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and 
Singapore are top of the list of foreign investors. 
  The lifting of the U.S. embargo, in my view, demonstrates 
first and foremost the pragmatism of Washington politicians, who 
know how to listen to the opinions of their country's 
enterprises. U.S. business will now begin to try to secure a 
position in the promising Vietnamese market, even if it is 
somewhat late starting. 
  It will bring its capital and technologies here for reasons 
that are far from philanthropic. But it is more advantageous 
for it to come to a still poor and backward Vietnam than to the 
vast expanses of a former superpower where, in the words of its 
president, the "idol of communism" has already been destroyed. 
U.S. businessmen are afraid of wreckers and prefer creators 
even if the latter have retained a loyalty to communist 
ideology. This, too, is one reason for the lifting of the 
anti-Vietnam embargo.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Mikheyev report: "Duma Recommendations on </F>
Ambassador Candidacies Will Not Be Mandatory"] 
  [Text] A session of the Duma's Committee for International 
Affairs devoted to structural and organizational questions has 
decided to form six subcommittees. These being subcommittees on 
problems of the United Nations and international organizations 
and also on interparliamentary relations; an international-legal 
subcommittee that will tackle human rights; a subcommittee on 
foreign economic problems; a subcommittee for cultural, 
scientific, and humanitarian cooperation; and one dealing with 
the international aspects of security and disarmament. 
  The subcommittee on cadre policy, whose task is primarily to 
examine the candidacies of Russia's future foreign ambassadors, 
was a separate issue. The discussion of its activity aroused 
the greatest commotion since it is directly linked with Article 
83 of the Russian Federation Constitution, which reads as 
follows: The president "appoints and recalls after 
consultations with the relevant committees or commissions of the 
chambers of the Federal Assembly diplomatic representatives of 
the Russian Federation in foreign states and international 
organizations." 
  Members of the committee agreed that the Committee for 
International Affairs is responsible for all appointments to 
distant foreign countries, while the Committee for CIS Affairs 
is left with nearby foreign countries. 
  The clause of the Constitution was interpreted as follows: 
On the one hand, holding consultations is a mandatory part of 
the procedure for "appointing or recalling ambassadors," but, on 
the other hand, the recommendations of the relevant committees 
are not binding on the president. It is advisable to hold 
consultations in the period between the new ambassador's being 
ratified by the Foreign Ministry Collegium and the president's 
issuing an edict. 
  Ambassadors' candidacies will be discussed at committee 
sessions and not coordinated with the head of the committee or 
with any of its members which should, according to Vladimir 
Lukin, chairman of the Committee for International Affairs, 
"ensure openness and glasnost." 
  "However, the candidate for the responsible post must answer 
questions. The presence of experts and the press, barring those 
cases when delicate aspects of national security may be 
involved, is not prohibited," the head of the committee told 
IZVESTIYA. 
  This procedure for conducting hearings will be recommended 
for inclusion in the Duma's standing orders, after which it will 
have the force of law. 
  "At this stage there are no differences of opinion with the 
Foreign Ministry or the president's administration on this 
matter," Vladimir Lukin added.

  [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin asked the State Duma, the standing lower chamber of the 
parliament, to pass a resolution on amnesty in the wake of the 
adoption of Russia's new constitution. 
  The house will consider the president's legislative 
initiative on Friday, February 11, according to Duma Chairman 
Ivan Rybkin. 
  The Duma will also have to finalise debates about its chief 
of staff, after failing to choose one out of seven candidates 
for the post at its meetings on February 7 and 8. 
  The Duma chairman told today's session that some house 
committees have been instructed to draft a bill on combatting 
crime. The Duma as also expected to hold hearings about local 
self-government and preparations for the elections to the local 
bodies of power in the component parts of the Russian 
Federation. According to some sources, communists and other 
right-wingers are set to struggle for a majority in many regions.

  [Text] The State Duma, the lower house of Russia's 
Parliament, decided on Wednesday to set up a parliamentary 
commission to investigate the causes of the events in Moscow in 
September-October 1993, when about 150 people died. 
  A total of 274 lawmakers voted for creating such a body, 46 
voted against, and 20 abstained from voting. The motion was put 
forward by Sergey Baburin, the leader of the "Russian Way" Duma 
faction and chairman of the All-Russia National Union. In 
backing up his proposal, Baburin stressed that the Duma had 
neglected "its moral duties to those who died," and until the 
circumstances of the events in Moscow last October are properly 
investigated, "the blood will be not only on the government but 
on the State Duma as well." 
  Russia's Choice member Gleb Yakunin argued that since a 
formal investigation was under way, the motion on a 
parliamentary commission should be postponed until the end of 
the inquiry. 
  Stanislav Govorukhin (the Democratic Party) noted that since 
the events were being investigated as a crime, it is hardly 
possible to assess "the scale of the tragedy, and the political 
motives and circumstances that led to the dissolution of 
parliament in October 1993."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Todres report in the "Campaign" column: "The </F>
State Duma Wishes Local Elections Well. They Will Go Ahead, 
Although the Liberal Democratic Party, the Communist Party, and 
the Democratic Party Oppose Them"] 
  [Text] The State Duma tried to interfere in the 
preparations for local elections but failed once again: None of 
the three draft resolutions on local elections got the requisite 
majority of votes yesterday. All three documents were sent to 
be further reworked which, according to deputies' estimates, 
will last for at least a week. This means that preparation for 
the elections has been left to the local authorities. The 
glaring violations already observed in a number of regions will 
apparently never be rectified. 
  In 64 Russian Federation components, local elections have 
been set for various dates in March and in another three for 
April. Boris Yeltsin's October edict defined merely the "basic 
guidelines," leaving the elaboration of the final procedures to 
the discretion of regional authorities (in fact the governors). 
  The greatest public response has been evoked by the 
limitations of the franchise in the form of residence and 
professional qualifications introduced by Anatoliy Sobchak in 
St. Petersburg: Yet now it appears that his example has been 
followed by authorities in other regions. Furthermore, Duma 
experts say that in many regions the rights of observers have 
been limited. In Tula Oblast, the deputy administration chief 
has appropriated the right to appoint part of the deputies to 
the representative body. 
  Two draft resolutions out of the three -- submitted by the 
Duma's committees on regional policy and local self-government 
and the Yabloko bloc -- invited the president "to take measures 
to correct the violation of citizens' voting rights." The third 
-- from the Liberal Democratic Party -- proposed to cancel the 
elections altogether. All three were defeated. 
  The debate, however, showed a curious distribution of votes. 
The idea of holding the elections but with a revised procedure 
has been supported by Women of Russia, Yabloko, and the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord [PRES]. The Zhirinovskiy followers, 
the communists, and the Travkin party want to call off the 
elections, in spite of the fact that forecasts are promising the 
"restorationists" success in many regions. As for the 
reformers, the Russia's Choice leader in confidential 
conversations with journalists was rather pessimistic. PRES 
deputy Anatoliy Sliva attributed the communists' and liberal 
democrats' mood to their hopes for coming to power in the 
capital, riding on the crest of a wave brought about by economic 
collapse this coming summer, and therefore they do not consider 
it reasonable to change authority at the local level. 
  It is perfectly clear, however, that local elections will be 
held as scheduled, regardless of the mood in the deputy corps. 
But, as Yabloko deputy Vyacheslav Igrunov noted, the elections 
"could have looked more decent but it seems that we have missed 
the chance."

  [Text] The situation throughout the front line in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] was tense yesterday and last 
night. Despite their casualties, Azerbaijan's Armed Forces made 
a significant effort to advance against the Armenian defense 
positions on various parts of the front line. 
  Bagram Aghadzhanyan, our correspondent in Stepanakert, 
quotes 
a statement by the NKR Defense Forces that Azerbaijan's military 
units tried to attack Matavis and [placename indistinct] in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon early yesterday morning. Serious clashes 
took place and both sides had casualties. An effort is being 
made to determine the outcome of the fighting. Elsewhere, NKR 
units rebuffed the latest enemy attacks in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon. 
  Six of Azerbaijan's military aircraft violated NKR airspace 
for 10 minutes and bombed several peaceful residential areas in 
Askeranskiy and Mardakertskiy Rayons yesterday.

  [Text] The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported 
that a relative calm prevailed on the Republic's borders since 
last night. 
  However, the same source reported that Azerbaijani Air Force 
planes again violated Armenia's airspace during the daytime 
yesterday. Two bombers appeared over the borders of 
Vardenisskiy Rayon at noon and then flew south at a considerable 
height over Kelbadzharskiy Rayon. One of them violated 
Armenia's airspace in Gorisskiy Rayon at around 1500 and dropped 
three cluster bombs in the border zone. The other flew toward 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]. 
  Four Azerbaijani aircraft carried out reconnaissance flights 
over the border regions of Gorisskiy Rayon at 1700 on the same 
day. They immediately left the region when faced with measures 
taken by the Armenian air-defense forces. 
  Though a relative calm is being maintained along most of the 
war front in Karabakh, Azerbaijani troops are still attacking 
the Karabakh positions in certain sectors. 
  NKR Defense Army press service reported that following an 
artillery barrage this morning, the enemy resumed the offensive 
against the southeastern sector. According to information 
received at noon, the Karabakh army formations were managing to 
halt the Azerbaijani attacks. 
  Only positional exchange of fire is taking place in the rest 
of the conflict zone.

  "Russia has had the elections and we congratulate it with

Chechnya, it held the elections in 1991 (the presidential 
elections after which the republic proclaimed its independence 
-- `IF')." 
  "The Chechen people have made their choice," said Dudayev. 
He said that another presidential election in Chechnya would 
take place in 1995, while the parliamentary elections were 
planned for 1996. 
  "If there is a need for early elections to some power 
structures of the republic, this will be announced by leaders of 
the independent Chechen Republic," said the president.

  [Text] Chechen Foreign Minister Shamseddin Yusef has called 
on Russia to pursue a policy of compromise in relationships with 
his republic. In an interview with Interfax he said that if 
today the Chechen leadership had wished, under Moscow pressure, 
to re-enter the Russian Federation, the "Chechen people would 
not have understood it." 
  If Moscow recognizes Chechnya's right to independence which 
it proclaimed two and a half years ago, "we shall remain good 
friends with Russia," said Yusef. 
  He believes that economics may be the basis for any 
political 
dialogue, including between Groznyy and Moscow. He said that 
the prospects for a political dialogue must lead to such 
dialogue. 
  Yusef said that the need for the earliest settlement of 
relations with Russia was the reason for the Chechen president's 
refusal to visit the United States "at the invitation of the 
American side." The minister did not specify who precisely 
invited Dudayev.

<F P=106> [Oleg Bedula and Aleksandr Bugay report: "We Must Be </F>
Realists. Tatar President and Prime Minister on Prospects for 
Developing Mutual Relations With Russia"] 
  [Text] Speaking at the latest session of parliament, 
Mintimer Shaymiyev said that "you have to be a pragmatist and a 
realist and see what actually exists, not what you want. We are 
being guided by this approach in building relations between 
Tatarstan and the Russian Federation." He stressed that the 
treaty on the demarcation of areas of responsibility and mutual 
delegation of powers by organs of state power of the Republic of 
Tatarstan and the Russian Federation is based on the 
harmonization of the two constitutions -- the Russian and Tatar 
Constitutions -- and unconditional respect for human rights, 
irrespective of people's nationality, sex, or religion. 
  "It must be said that what is being produced is a completely 
new and unprecedented document which pays special attention to 
the sphere of the realms of competence of the organs of state 
power of the Russian Federation and Tatarstan." This treaty, 
Shaymiyev stressed, "will be a testament to the reform of Russia 
and the renewal of the Russian Federation on the basis of 
democratic principles and a guarantee of Tatarstan's statehood." 
  Tatar Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov observed in turn that 
he could not conceive of there being no representative in the 
Russian Duma and Federation Council "able to state the 
republic's position competently and convincingly." The premier 
believes that on 13 March (the day of the repeat elections) we 
must work to ensure that the people turn out to choose worthy 
representatives. We are to have two people in the Federation 
Council and five in the Duma. They must be unpoliticized people 
with good minds who can think clearly, who are committed to 
their own people, and who can protect their interests. 
  Sabirov talked about the separation from the Federation 
Council desired by radical nationals as a politician with a firm 
grasp of the situation: 
  "We can show our pride and say: Politically we are now 
independent.... But in three or four days or in a week we will 
be on our knees, saying: We cannot live like this." 
  The premier also cleared up the question of mutual relations 
with federal organs of power. 
  "Ultimatums are not a path which the people of Tatarstan can 
take. We must take only the path of routine work, hard, 
stressful work...of agreements, and of a treaty, which must 
define the Republic of Tatarstan's special place -- both 
politically and economically and in all other respects."

<F P=106> [Marsel Zaripov article under the rubric "Interstate Ties": </F>
"At the Crossroads of Asia and Europe"] 
  [Text] Many people have written about Kazan, the capital of 
Tatarstan, but it was surely Herzen, the "eternal exile," who 
described the city's character most accurately when he said: 
"It is the main caravanserai on the road taking European ideas 
into Asia and the Asiatic character into Europe." 
  That description remains true to this day. 
  In Tatarstan's political life the last week of January had a 
Spanish theme. A republic delegation headed by President 
Mintimer Shaymiyev spent five days on a working visit to Madrid. 
The result of the visit was a major treaty on economic, trade, 
cultural, and information partnership and the creation of 
favorable conditions for contacts between commodity producers, 
cultural institutions, and scientists. 
  Spain is not the first foreign country with which Tatarstan 
is forging direct ties and establishing permanent business 
bridges. Treaties have already been concluded with Turkey, 
Austria, and Greece. 
  Each interstate act of this kind marks the beginning of the 
development of ties and contacts at the level of firms, offices, 
and institutions, which also carry out joint programs. True, 
there is one highly significant difference here. The 
traditionally eastern term "caravanserai" included the market 
ethos of fairs, bazaars, and trading places. Nowadays this 
phrase signifies not so much an exchange of goods as a 
distribution of ideas and technologies and a pooling of efforts 
in the solution of common technical, production, and social 
tasks. True, the main rule of cooperation is older than life 
itself: what to sell, how much to sell, what price to pay for 
it, and what profit to take. 
  One of the main problems which Tatarstan is determinedly and 
persistently working on is not to become obsessed with simple 
commodity exchange but to organize cooperation in the production 
sphere and tackle projects which will benefit the partners and 
the republic itself. It is important that the revenue from the 
sale of goods abroad exceeds spending on imports. 
  In 1993 the republic's foreign trade turnover rose by 45.9 
percent and reached U.S. $948 million. Exports rose 73.3 
percent to $761 million. In the system of world trade 
Tatarstan's goods are distributed as follows: one quarter of 
its exports go to the U.S. market, 13.2 percent to Germany, 12.2 
percent to Turkey, 9.3 percent to Hungary, and 7.5 percent to 
Switzerland. The export register includes oil, too, but machine 
building and petrochemical goods form a large part. 
  However, the import indicators look far more modest -- just 
$187.4 million. 
  There are also around 50 joint ventures with mixed capital 
involved in export trade and import purchases but their role at 
the moment is a purely token one. For instance, the 0.5 billion 
tonnes of oil which such firms account for represents just 2 
percent of total extraction.

  [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- Anatoliy Chubays, Russian 
deputy prime minister and privatization chief, suggested that 
Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov opposed large-scale privatization in 
the capital for political considerations. Chubays told a 
special briefing on Wednesday that Luzhkov's criticism of 
privatization was most likely prompted by the fact that 
presently he is launching his own presidential campaign. The 
best way of conducting an election campaign is certainly 
vehement criticism which never fails to yield political 
dividends. 
  But this was not the only reason for Luzhkov's behaviour, 
according to Chubays. The Moscow mayor may also resist 
privatization because it would deprive him of the property 
Luzhkov would not like to let go. While privatization aims to 
snatch this property from the hands of state officials and to 
transfer it to 150 million holders of privatization checks. 
  The State Property Committee chief told reporters that only 
12 large businesses had floated their capital in Moscow during 
the past two years, which amounts to 2 per cent of enterprises 
subject to privatization. Chubays qualified this as a complete 
failure of large-scale privatization in the Russian capital. 
  As for small privatization in Moscow, the deputy prime 
minister said it had been carried out illegally. Almost all 
assets of shops and stores were transferred to salesmen 
virtually for next to nothing. As a result, Moscow lost tens of 
billion of roubles of potential revenues. 
  Chubays said he would demand that Moscow leaders strictly 
observe the laws, decrees and resolutions pertaining to 
privatization, including through court.

  [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev ended a three-day visit to the Volga Military 
District and returned to Moscow on Wednesday evening. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS before departure to Moscow 
Grachev said that he was satisfied with good combat readiness of 
Russian troops which was confirmed by the results of an 
inspection of five military units belonging to the military 
district. 
  The defence minister positively assessed the construction of 
houses for Russian servicemen withdrawn from abroad, adding that 
the construction was going ahead at a fast pace. Grachev 
visited three regions and one republic and pointed out that he 
was satisfied with the attitude of local authorities to 
servicemen. 
  On Wednesday, Grachev visited troops stationed in the 
Ulyanovsk region, defence-related enterprises and met with 
regional heads and the city administration. While at the 
"Aviastar" joint stock society, the biggest aviation enterprise 
in Europe, Grachev said that in the near future priority in 
defence aircraft will be given to military-transport planes 
capable of transporting forces of the Defence Ministry to any 
region. This task is envisaged by the Russian military doctrine 
which lays the emphasis on mobile rapid deployment force.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 9 Feb -- "North Ossetia is prepared to 
move consistently toward establishing normal relations with all 
its neighbors. Strong-arm methods should not be used on the 
path toward peace, for force gives gives rise only to force." 
These words were uttered by North Ossetian President Akhsarbek 
Galazov, who today received a Russian parliamentary delegation 
which is visiting the region. The delegation is headed by 
Valeriy Fateyev, member of the upper chamber's security 
committee. 
  During the meeting between the president and the 
parliamentarians there was discussion of the problems of 
regulating the situation in the state of emergency zone on the 
territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In the opinion of 
Akhsarbek Galazov, "the problem of the return of refugees must 
be solved in an integrated manner on the basis of the Kislovodsk 
agreements. In this complicated question the coordinating 
commissions which have been set up in all populated points of 
Prigorodnyy Rayon have the deciding word." 
  Valeriy Fateyev told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the 
aim 
of the parliamentarians' visit to North Ossetia and Ingushetia 
is to gather objective information about the situation in the 
conflict zone, to assess the situation in the region, and to try 
to find a path toward peace and accord between the two 
republics. They are to have meetings with the leadership of 
Ingushetia, the interim administration, and various categories 
of refugees, and will visit populated points of Prigorodnyy 
Rayon. "The path toward peace and accord," Valeriy Fateyev 
stressed, "is long and hard, but it must be sought. There must 
be a stable situation in the northern Caucasus."

  [Text] Seven northern regions in Maritime Kray have formed 
an economic union and this, fortunately, has nothing to do with 
separatist ideas. On the contrary, the geography and common 
economic problems point to the need for a consolidation of 
efforts in the interests of the whole of Maritime Kray. 
  The most urgent task is to shake up the mining and fur 
industries in these regions by spring, to protect the 
environment, and prevent natural resources being exported. The 
organization will be a kind of economic mini-community within 
Maritime Kray, which is a Russian Federation subject, and it 
will not have any political goals.

  [Summary] Local government in Maritime Kray has stopped 
making payments earmarked for revival of the raw minerals 
industry into the federal budget. This will enable geological 
prospecting and mining enterprises to retain tens of millions of 
rubles that they can use to revive the local minerals industry 
and to help alleviate social difficulties for the work forces of 
the Solnechnyy mining and enrichment combine, the Uralskoye mine 
administration, and a number of prospecting cooperatives. The 
Amur gold mining cooperative has already, with the consent of 
the tax inspectorate, put funds into stabilizing the financial 
position of the Ayano-Mayskiy mining and geology enterprise. 
  Reductions in funding from the federal budget have halted 
all 
prospecting work and all growth in exploitation of known natural 
resources in the kray. Extra funds promised by the Russian 
Federation Government to stabilize the industry have not been 
allocated this year.

<F P=106> [Letter from Bilibino AES collective followed by </F>
unattributed report: "Halting AES Is Not Like Closing a Barn"] 
  [Text] An extremely grave situation has taken shape at the 
Bilibino AES [nuclear electric power station] -- the only source 
of electricity supplies on Chukotka -- because of consumers' 
nonpayments for electricity and heating. The deterioration of 
the financial situation has obliged the station's specialists as 
of May 1993 to halt all safety work. There were only sufficient 
funds for current operation. Today the acquisition of equipment 
which is extremely necessary for the AES' safe operation has 
stopped completely. Nuclear fuel was last delivered in 
September. Planned repair is threatened with disruption. 
  Wages are paid with interruptions of two to three months. We 
are not able even to travel to the funerals of our relations 
because of the high cost of air tickets. Under northern 
conditions the inevitable increase in prices for food has 
brought many specialists to the poverty line. 
  The survival of the entire region depends on us. We are 
doing everything necessary for the safe operation of the AES. 
But with every passing day it is becoming harder to do this. 
Our repeated appeals to the sectorial government organs have 
brought no tangible results. 
  [Signed] The Bilibino AES collective 
  The editorial office was told at the "Rosenergoatom" state 
concern that unfortunately the situation is typical of the 
majority of AES's. Taxpayers' total debts as of today are 351 
billion rubles. Because of this other AES's are threatened with 
stoppage. Matters are no better with regard to the social 
situation at enterprises. The payment for thermal and 
electrical energy is through the Russian "Integrated Energy 
System of Russia" joint stock company, which has managed to 
collect only 17 percent of the necessary funds. Electric power 
lines and electrical power stations are under the company's 
jurisdiction but the function it has assumed as a connecting 
link between electricity producers and consumer has prove beyond 
it. Hundreds of nuclear electric power stations are unable to 
acquire fuel or carry out current repairs.

  [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- Azerbaijani troops 
launched a new offensive in the southeastern section of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh front on Wednesday but met fierce resistance of 
the Karabakh defence army, the Nagorno-Karabakh defence army 
headquarters told ITAR-TASS by phone. 
  The report said that the situation in other sections of the 
front remained relatively calm, meaning that the sides were 
exchanging fire but did not mount offensives. 
  The Azerbaijani army has lost up to 5,000 soldiers and 
officers, one warplane and 62 armoured vehicles, including 36 
tanks, in the 1.5-month large-scale offensive it launched on 
December 18, 1993. It also lost 12 artillery guns, including 
three Grad missile launchers, and a large amount of other arms. 
Twenty six Azerbaijani soldiers have surrendered. 
  The Karabakh side lost about 300 people and 24 armoured 
vehicles which have been fully made up for by seized Azerbaijani 
tanks and armoured personnel carriers. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh military explain the decline in the 
activity of the Azerbaijani army by considerable losses, 
especially among new recruiters who make up the bulk of its 
troops, and the absence of big positive results. Karabakh 
experts said that Azerbaijan's initial successes owed to its 
strength superiority. They were of a local nature and were 
eventually neutralised by the Karabakh forces.

  [Text] Tallinn, February 9 -- "The continued attempts of 
Russian officials to slander Estonia in order to influence world 
public opinion and international organizations are meant to 
isolate Estonia from other democratic nations," Estonian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs official statement of Wednesday [9 
February] states, adding that Estonia's ambassador to the 
Russian Federation has been instructed to present a demarche in 
Moscow in connection with the series of slanderous and incorrect 
statements by Russian Foreign Minister [FM] Andrey Kozyrev and 
other Russian officials. 
  As reported by Interfax, on February 8, FM Kozyrev accused 
the Baltic States of "ethnic cleansing" and other serious human 
rights violations, the statement says. In remarks to reporters, 
he stated, "About one third of the residents are treated 
differently based upon ethnicity. I have in mind the 
Russian-speakers -- Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews and 
even Finns -- who are not being given citizenship. They want 
citizenship, but it is being denied for one reason: ethnicity. 
If this is not `ethnic cleansing' what is it?" 
  "Since numerous UN, CSCE, Council of Europe and other 
international delegations have all reaffirmed that the situation 
in Estonia fully measures up to international human rights 
standards, the question arises: Who is not telling the truth, 
the international organizations or the politician who has 
repeatedly declared Estonia to be part of Russia's sphere of 
interest, the so- called near abroad?" the Foreign Ministry's 
statement says. 
  The Foreign Ministry affirms that the laws of the Republic 
of 
Estonia "allow everyone to acquire citizenship regardless of 
ethnicity". 
  There is a positive aspect to the Russian Foreign Minister's 
comments on February 8, too, the statement continues. Namely, 
he presented an important historical position which has caused 
many bi-lateral disagreements due to differing interpretations. 
FM Kozyrev said, "I admit the crimes of the Stalin regime, but 
we cannot forget that these were carried out by political powers 
-- on the one side Stalin, on the other Hitler -- who signed the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact." 
  "It is to be hoped that the Russian Foreign Minister will be 
able to take the next step and to admit that the Baltic States 
were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940," the Foreign 
Ministry's statement concludes.

  [Text] Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn handed over 
an Estonian Foreign Ministry protest in Moscow today, in 
connection with the continued Russian campaign of statements 
distorting the reality in Estonia. 
  The Riigikogu has issued a statement on increasing 
imperialist tendencies in Russian foreign policy. The Riigikogu 
voices resolute protest against the increasing imperialist 
tendencies in the Russian foreign policy according to which the 
Baltic countries fall within the Russian sphere of influence. 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has consistently 
justified the continued Russian troop presence on the territory 
of the Republic of Estonia, against the will of the Estonian 
people and the norms of international law. Statements made 
against Estonia by Russian Government members are in conflict 
with the UN Charter and the provisions of the CSCE final acts, 
which Russia, too, has pledged to observe in its foreign policy. 
The Riigikogu draws the attention of the parliaments of all 
countries to the fact that in 1992, at a CSCE Helsinki summit, 
Russia took upon itself the obligation of withdrawing its troops 
from the territory of the Baltic states quickly, in an orderly 
manner, and completely, without setting any additional 
conditions. 
  [Words indistinct] for this reason the development of 
relations between Estonia and Russia has run into a deadlock. 
The Riigikogu holds the position that for the purpose of 
developing relations between countries it is essential to 
proceed from the principles of respect for a country's 
sovereignty and equality, from those countries' legislative 
acts, and from the principle of mutual interest.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 08, BNS -- Estonia on Friday [4 
February] initiated criminal proceedings against Pyotr Rozhok, 
the representative of Russia's radical nationalist Liberal 
Democratic Party in Estonia. 
  Charges were brought under Article 72 of the criminal code, 
the minister of population, Peeter Olesk, said. 
  Olesk told a BNS correspondent that Rozhok now cannot be 
deported from the country -- and that there is no reason to do 
so -- before the case is brought to a conclusion. 
  The issue also stood on the agenda of today's meeting of the 
Cabinet of Ministers. The Cabinet heard the opinion of Interior 
Minister Heiki Arike on the issue. 
  The director general of the Defense Police, Juri Pihl, said 
it was his department that had initiated the criminal case. "He 
has not been arrested so far," Pihl said. 
  Rozhok in an interview with BNS at about 4 p.m. today said 
he 
knew nothing of the charges brought against him. He said he had 
no contacts with the security police recently. 
  The representative of Zhirinovskiy's party in Estonia said 
he 
had no intention to leave the country. "But why?" he asked, 
explaining that he is living on a territory that is Russia's 
domain for ages. 
  Vasiliy Ostapchuk, adviser at the Russian Embassy in 
Tallinn, 
said Rozhok had not turned to the embassy for help. "If Rozhok 
appeals to us for help, we can act under the consular convention 
and the legal assistance agreement," he said. 
  The criminal code's Article 72 foresees punishments ranging 
from fines to one year in prison for activity aimed at 
instigating ethnic, racial or religious hostility. 
  Rozhok in his public statements on several occasions has 
expressed views hostile toward Estonia. In an interview with 
the SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK newspaper of the northeast Estonian town 
of Sillamae last month he called on Russian army veterans to 
form paramilitary units "for defending the (Russians') honor and 
dignity" and again claimed Estonia was Russia's traditional 
domain. 
  Rozhok is legally a citizen of Russia since May 28, 1992.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 09, BNS -- Russian militant nationalist 
Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy voiced 
outspoken threats against each and every one of ethnic Estonians 
if Estonia decided on legal action against his representative in 
the country. 
  "Warn the Estonian Government that even if a hair should 
fall 
from the head of the representative of Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party, Pyotr Rozhok, the Estonian Government will 
have to think about the fate of 900,000 Estonians," Zhirinovsky 
told a BNS correspondent today. 
  "I swap one Rozhok for 900,000 Estonians," he said when 
asked 
to comment on charges brought against the representative of his 
party in Estonia. Rozhok has been charged for instigating 
inter-ethnic hostility. 
  "If Rozhok is put into an Estonian jail, end will come to 
Estonia and Tallinn. We will implement such measures that the 
Estonians will forget that they are Estonians," Zhirinovsky said 
without hiding his emotion, then turning his back to the BNS 
correspondent. 
  The extremist leader's remarks were hailed by the group 
accompanying him.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 09, BNS -- The Estonian defense forces 
will be armed mostly with Israeli-made weapons of the NATO 
standards and the Defense League is to get weapons of Soviet 
origin, the country's Chief of Staff Ants Laaneots said in a 
press conference today. 
  Laaneots said the Army will mainly get 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm 
guns. The 7.62-mm PKT standard machine guns, received from 
Israel as a gift, will be used on armored vehicles. The same 
shipment's 23 mm anti-aircraft cannons will add strength to the 
Army's anti-aircraft weaponry. 
  The only weapons in the consignment that fail to correspond 
to NATO standards are 23 mm cannons. NATO uses the 20 mm 
version. 
  The Defense Union paramilitary's arms list will comprise 
7.62 
mm Soviet-made guns, as well as RPD machine guns of the same 
caliber received in gift from Israel. 
  Laaneots said the Defense League will also get anti-tank 
bomb 
throwers, which will make the volunteer league a "notable 
military force" in 1994. 
  The police will have 9 mm guns, mainly Mini-Uzis. An 
emergency task force will get 5.45 mm Soviet-made machine guns. 
  Part of the Israeli weapons will go to the border forces. 
The Chief of Staff said border guard forces had also received 
light anti-tank weapons. 
  Laaneots said the division of the weapons as made now was of 
temporary character, adding that the system was needed to ensure 
proper servicing and right ammunition supplies. 
  He also assured that the country was facing no problems in 
obtaining ammunition for the guns purchased from Israel, as 
cartridges for the respective sizes are manufactured in most of 
Europe's industrially developed countries.

  [Text] Kiev, 9 Feb -- As UNIAN has reported, Ukraine's 
Cabinet of Ministers has decided to allocate government credit 
for the financial stabilization of the economy. Addressed or 
targeted assistance to individual sectors has the purpose of 
unblocking monetary flows restrained by the crisis of 
non-payments, which have dangerously exacerbated in the last 
month. 
  A UNIAN correspondent has learned from sources close to 
Ukraine's Finance Ministry that the total value of government 
financial stabilization credit comes to 6 trillion karbovantsi. 
A government official, who wished to remain anonymous, informed 
the UNIAN correspondent that the value of the credit was shared 
out in the following way: Five trillion karbovantsi was issued 
to Ukraine's National Bank at an annual interest rate of 240 
percent, and 1 trillion karbovantsi to agricultural producers at 
30 percent. These funds were transferred via Ukraine's National 
Bank on 5 and 9 February. 
  According to preliminary data, credit of 5 trillion 
karbovantsi has been addressed to the State Committee for 
Material Reserves, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of 
Machine-Building, Military-Industrial Complex and Conversion, 
the Ministry of Power and Electrification, the State Committee 
for the Food Industry, and oblast trade directorates. The 
Ahrokhim [?state concern for agricultural chemical industry] and 
state concern for material supply and service in the 
agrarian-industrial complex will share 1 trillion karbovantsi 
between them to conduct the sowing campaign (for protecting 
plants and purchasing spare parts and fuel). 
  A government cable signed by Ukraine's Acting Prime Minister 
Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, and Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of the board 
of Ukraine's National Bank, was received at oblast directorates 
of the National Bank, commercial banks, ministries, and 
departments on 9 February. The cable obliges the Prominvestbank 
[Ukrainian State Commercial Construction Industry Bank], the 
"Ukrayina" agro-industrial bank [the Republican Joint-Stock 
Commercial Agro- Industrial Bank] and the Ukrsotsbank [Ukrainian 
Joint-Stock Commercial Bank of Social Development] to open a 
specialized account numbered 122 "Government credit for the 
financial stabilization of the economy" for the relevant 
ministries. In accordance with this cable, the ministries are 
to determine a set of enterprises and make settlements for 
electric power, fuel and energy resources, mineral fertilizers, 
agricultural technology and spare parts for it, and settlements 
with the railways, as fully as possible from the credit. 
  The cable from the Cabinet of Ministers and Ukraine's 
National Bank has categorically banned the payment of debts to 
commercial structures, and joint and other enterprises with a 
non-state form of ownership from the credit. The heads of the 
government and bank stressed that financial assistance is not 
being granted to enterprises with surplus currency. On 26 
February, commercial banks are obliged to direct the free 
surplus funds received from the government credit to the payment 
of contributions to the pension fund and budget to begin with, 
and only then to satisfying other current needs of enterprises. 
Commercial banks are also banned from using the surplus funds 
as credit resources.

  [Text] V. Semenyuk, Ukraine's minister of power engineering 
and electrification, has stated that since January 1994 the 
industry has become unprofitable: The debit balance constitutes 
2.3 trillion karbovantsi [K] and the overall debt about K6 
trillion. 
  Power engineers have no money to pay for the energy sources 
and for the electricity supplied by nuclear power stations. For 
that reason, incidentally, four power units, producing millions 
[of kilowatts] will be closed down. 
  Every day, between 40 and 45 power units at thermal electric 
power stations are standing idle. The inability to pay has 
paralyzed the operation of about 2,000 enterprises in this 
sector. 
  The minister appealed to heads of oblast state 
administrations and to heads of councils of people's deputies 
with a request to provide maximum assistance to local power 
engineering enterprises. The enterprises and organizations must 
both repay debts for the electricity consumed and strictly 
adhere to the rules of electricity consumption.

  [Text] Tula February 8 TASS -- The aftermath of the 
Chernobyl catastrophe is not so black as it is believed. This 
was a statistically substantiated conclusion made at a science 
and practical conference, which took place in the Plavskiy 
district of the Tula region on Tuesday. The conference was held 
with participation of experts of the Moscow-based Academy of 
Medical Sciences. 
  Although the Plavskiy district got the most significant 
portion of the radioactive pollution in the Tula region, not a 
single case of acute radioactive exposure was registered, 
according to the statistics. 
  Moreover, according to the data on the regional spread of 
various diseases, the situation in the district is even safer 
than average in the region and in the districts with a good 
record in this respect. There are fewer cases of child 
mortality, diseases of the endocrine system and congenital 
anomalities among its population. 
  However, the fact that inhabitants have come to apply to the 
hospitals for medical assistance more rarely over the last few 
years, casts a shadow of doubt over the reliability of the 
statistics. 
  According to Yelena Kuznetsova, who works for the Regional 
Committee for Environmental Protection, which studies the 
problems of the Chernobyl aftermath, the statistics must be 
treated cautiously, whereas the fact that the inhabitants of the 
district neglect medical services causes serious concern.

<F P=106> [Own correspondent Boris Sverdlov report: "Ukraine: Deputy </F>
Khmara Does Not Want To Give Up the Nuclear Bomb"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- The election campaign is gathering momentum 
in Ukraine. An average of five or six candidates per Supreme 
Council seat has already been registered in many electoral 
districts. The leaders of parties and movements are not 
stinting on interviews in the mass media, are proposing various 
scenarios for emerging from economic collapse, and are analyzing 
the present blunders in detail. 
  But everyone is expressing his attitude toward the recent 
agreement on nuclear-free status for Ukraine. Some are 
unconditionally supporting L. Kravchuk, while others are 
accusing him of betraying national interests. 
  The latter people mostly represent national-radical parties. 
Judging by their speeches, you get the impression that they 
missed the press conference by the foreign minister and defense 
minister, which has been repeatedly shown on republic 
television. At the press conference the department heads 
explained in detail that implementation of the agreement 
entirely accords with the state's interests, that Russia and the 
United States have given Ukraine clear national security 
guarantees, and that machinery for immediate compensation for 
each nuclear missile that is removed has been enumerated. 
  A recent speech by Stepan Khmara stands out. Accusing the 
United States and Russia of imperial ways, he painted a black 
picture of the "humiliating agreement" signed by Leonid 
Kravchuk, who, according to him, should be immediately relieved 
of the presidency. He called on parliament to block the 
"adventure by the head of state." 
  At the present stage the sharp attacks by opponents of the 
agreement pursue a single aim -- to influence the course of 
parliament's discussion of nuclear status. 
  The "New Ukraine," Ukrainian Civic Congress, and Slavic 
Unity 
Party movements have spoken out against the wholesale criticism 
of the president.... 
  Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma declared that in Ukraine 
there are many "patriotic" politicians who were at first all in 
favor of nuclear-free status, but now are campaigning equally 
insistently on the other side. When were they being sincere? 
  Nevertheless, most observers are hopefully awaiting the 
discussion of the agreement between the three presidents in the 
Supreme Council. In their view, only a positive result will 
enable the young state to strengthen its independence and 
stabilize the economy with the help of long-term large-scale 
credits.

<F P=106> [Appeal by Levko Lukyanenko, cochairman of the Preelectoral </F>
Democratic Union of Ukraine, adopted on 28 January] 
  [Text] Ukrainian people! You are free people and should 
act like free people! Realize the current situation and act -- 
go and vote! 
  You are at a crossroads on the path toward your national 
prosperity. On 27 March, you will be able to give direction to 
the development of Ukraine by doing one of two things: Either 
you will elect new people and we will choose a different path of 
development, or you will elect old bureaucrats and we will 
follow the old path. So, do you want life to go on the way it 
is? If you do not, change it! You can do it! 
  For 70 years you were taught that you were subordinated to 
the Soviet state; for 70 years you were instructed to work while 
the Communist Party was to think for you. 
  All-pervasive and continual propaganda and harsh repressions 
made you see your native Ukrainian land as a place of temporary 
residence; they tried to replace your motherland -- its ancient 
culture and the graves of your ancestors -- with communist 
Soviet power. 
  You were taken away from your native soil; they killed in 
you 
the feeling of rightful owner; they killed your national pride 
and implanted the inferiority complex that belongs to a person 
between a Ukrainian and a stateless Soviet citizen. They killed 
the feeling of dignity and importance in you and taught you to 
feel like a miserable creature in an enormous working 
conglomerate of people. In this working conglomerate, a person 
is only a cog in a huge state mechanism, the task of which is to 
strengthen the communist state and expand the power of Moscow 
across the whole globe. 
  This lie was encouraged by the system of total control over 
people's minds and behavior. Having taken away your economic 
freedom, your chances of merely surviving depended on the 
attitude of kolkhoz and factory managers to you. You had to 
debase yourself, and this is how you lost your personal dignity. 
You were financially dependent on the state and became a slave. 
  Over the lengthy years of harsh dictatorship, you became 
convinced that the communist authorities could do anything they 
wanted, and you could not oppose them. Before the elections, 
the authorities used to select subservient people and announce 
beforehand the number of communists, komsomol members, and 
nonparty members. They decided the percentage of men and women, 
industrial and agricultural workers, and officials -- including 
the level of their education and their nationality -- that were 
to be elected to the Supreme Soviet. You did not have any 
choice. You could not refuse to vote, because you risked your 
safe social status. Over this lengthy period, you used to think 
that the state does not depend on you and is beyond your 
control, while you were an appendage and cheap slave labor. 
  Times have changed. 
  Ukraine has become a democratic state. We have acquired 
freedom of speech, we can engage in political and social 
activities and rallies, and we have the opportunity to nominate 
any number of candidates in one constituency. State decrees are 
no longer formulated in the Central Party Committee but in the 
Supreme Council. While the lawmaking process used to be 
conducted behind closed doors, all Ukraine now follows the 
course of deputies drafting laws. 
  Since a civilized society develops in accordance with the 
laws formulated by the legislature, we can change the laws and 
thus change the nature and direction of our state's development. 
  The Supreme Council changes laws according to the demands of 
various deputy factions. Under democratic laws, politicians 
operate in full view of their voters, and the voters know their 
viewpoints. This is a good opportunity to alter the development 
of the state by electing people who supporting one political 
line, and at the same time not electing people who have the 
opposite political viewpoints. 
  Therefore, Ukrainian people can halt the fall in production, 
inflation, the collapse of the state, and the drop in living 
standards by dismissing the present communist authorities and 
electing new, progressive people. 
  You can see that just one vote can decide the destiny of a 
draft law, even if there are more than 300 deputies present in 
the session hall. Hence, the choice of a single family, a 
single voter, can determine whether a supporter of the old 
regime or a reformer is elected in a constituency of 86,000 
people. 
  Esteemed voter, take advantage of 27 March and use your vote 
to deprive the communists of their power and entrust the 
patriots to raise Ukraine from the ruins! 
  You are not a slave. The democratic independence of Ukraine 
has made you a citizen with full rights. Along with your 
rights, democracy has endowed you with the responsibility for 
your own destiny and the destiny of Ukraine. 
  Straighten your backs, raise up your heads, and use your 
power to create a better Supreme Council. 
  Your choice affects not only the destiny of Ukraine, but the 
destiny of the neighboring states. The entire world is watching 
you. If you do not follow the path of reform and democracy and 
if you ruin your economy, you will fall into the trap of the 
Russian imperialists who will revive the old empire. Then, the 
hopes of Lithuanians, Tatars, and Georgians -- the hopes of all 
the enslaved people of the former Union -- will die. We will 
lose our freedom; a cold war with the West will begin; this will 
lead to real war and the death of European Christian 
civilization along with Ukraine! 
  So show the world that you abandon Moscow's slavery and are 
open to wider contacts with the West by developing democracy and 
the implementation of reform. 
  Remember: God gave us a beautiful land, air, and sky. To 
enjoy these blessings, you must resolve our economic issues. 
Experience has shown that the old guard cannot implement these 
ideas, so send new people to the Supreme Council. 
  Do not ask for a better life! Improve it yourself! 
  You have to make a choice on 27 March. Make a choice in 
favor of reform. 
  Go! Choose! Change! 
  Open up a new life for a new and independent Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Liberals Support Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] I.P. Markulov, chairman of the Liberal Party of 
Ukraine [LPU], has held a news conference in Donetsk. Since the 
party's position is generally well known to the electorate, 
Markulov dealt chiefly with answering questions. The LPU is not 
going to form any electoral bloc because a political bloc with 
some other force, he said, will result in nothing but the 
neutralization of both forces. Personally, I will not put myself 
forward on the electoral list, Markulov stressed. This was what 
the party decided. A leader should concentrate on giving the 
greatest possible support to his candidates. 
  One of the questions concerned the fulfillment of the 
protocol agreement between the LPU and the Donetsk strike 
committee. Here it was said that the coal lobby in the 
government does not want to sign a contract with the World Bank 
because of its condition that the coal industry be restructured. 
According to the LPU leader, if unprofitable mines continue to 
operate at the expense of profitable ones, the money allotted by 
the Bank may go into a black hole. 
  It was also stated that the LPU has broad links with the 
Liberal International; however, the LPU domestic policy should 
not overstep state borders. The party does not receive, and has 
not received, any money from the West, in other words, the party 
does not rely on overseas funds. 
  According to Markulov, the battle today is not between 
political parties, but between those who want to preserve 
socialism on one hand, and those who fight for radical reforms 
on the other. Another question concerned the LPU attitude 
toward Zhirinovskiy's party. The LPU chairman stated, among 
other things, that Zhirinovskiy's style and methods are 
unacceptable. To declare oneself a liberal and to pursue an 
extremist policy are incompatible things. 
  The main thrust of the LPU is to support private ownership, 
while its economic policy is socially oriented. The party 
believes that Ukraine needs a presidential form of rule. 
Political fighting among certain individuals should not obscure 
the country's strategic line of development, in other words, the 
country's disintegration and interregional conflicts must be 
prevented. 
  Answering a number of other questions about the upcoming 
parliamentary elections, the LPU chairman stated that the new 
parliament should consist of new people.

  [Text] Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs announced today that 
the Cabinet of Ministers has agreed to allow Russia to keep the 
Skrunda radar station at its disposal for a period, because 
Latvia's previous obstinacy on the issue of the full withdrawal 
of the Russian troops seems to be gradually losing Western 
support. This decision by the Latvian Government was motivated, 
Birkavs said, by the claim that in the event that Latvia 
continues to decline to compromise on the issue of the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops, it could lose the support of 
European countries and the United States. 
  According to the (?previously) reached agreement, Russia 
will 
maintain the Skrunda radar station for four years as its 
property, and after the end of this period, dismantling of the 
site will be carried out over 18 months.

  [Text] Riga February 10 TASS -- The Latvian authorities 
want to evict Russian General Anatoliy Vodopyanov from his 
apartment, whom they tried to deport handcuffed from the country 
on January 10 last. Beside him two other generals and a captain 
of the Russian Army have received notices from district 
authorities to vacate the apartments they are occupying. In 
this connection the commander of the North-West Group of Troops 
has sent a letter to the prime minister of Latvia. 
  The letter stresses that the ultimatum demand to vacate 
apartments containing a threat to use force, is especially 
characteristic of two Riga districts. All these apartments 
belong to the Russian Defence Ministry Residential Foundation 
and their further use is a topic to be discussed at talks 
between the two countries. 
  One of the notices has been signed by head of the Vidzem 
District of Riga Andreis Ruchs, who had organized a scandalous 
action against two generals a month ago. The Latvian Government 
had relieved him of his post. But he has been once again 
nominated to this post by deputies of the district. That is why 
the republican prosecutor's office has asked parliament to 
permit a criminal case to be lodged against him. But it turned 
out that Sejm (parliament) does not have the judicial right to 
do so. 
  That is why, while discussing the prosecutor's request, Sejm 
would rather send a letter to the commission and recommend it to 
prepare amendments to the law on the deputy status. Until then 
Ruchs and his followers will remain free to add other Russian 
generals to their list, who in their view, are liable to be 
deported from Latvia.

<F P=106> [Article by Agita Berzina: "Number of Drug Addicts Rising in </F>
Latvia"] 
  [Text] Riga, 29 Jan -- The death rate among drug addicts in 
Latvia has increased, the number of drug-related crimes and the 
number of drug seizures have also risen, and drugs which were 
previously not available have now appeared on the streets of our 
country -- such were the gloomy facts given to journalists today 
by Janis Stradins, the chief drug expert at the Health 
Department. 
  The most worrying fact -- confirmed by statistic data on the 
problem of drug abuse in Latvia -- is the high death rate from 
willful drug indulgence, explained J. Stradins. 
  Last year, 47 drug addicts died, in 1992 -- 27 died, in 1991 
-- nine. Most of them died from drug overdoses. In 20 cases, 
experts could not determine precisely which drug had caused 
death since several narcotics had been used simultaneously. 
  The number of crimes related to drug use, storage, and 
trafficking has also increased. In 1993, 269 people were 
prosecuted on criminal charges, in 1992 -- 156. Last year, 320 
drug dens were discovered, in 1992 -- 210. 
  The quantity of confiscated drugs is also rising. Last year, 
166.2 kg of poppy straw were confiscated, in 1992 -- 114.8 kg. 
Given our circumstances, these are the most dangerous cases, 
stated J. Stradins, because addicts, by using relatively simple 
technology, can extract heroin from the straw. At present, the 
greatest share of drugs reaching Latvia come from Lithuania, 
Russia, and southern Ukraine. Thus, poppies from the south, 
containing more heroin than locally grown ones, are making their 
way into Latvia. 
  Another substance widely used by addicts is efedron, which 
is 
extracted from medicine already containing the narcotic. It is 
a very effective drug which creates distinct addiction. Heroin 
is usually injected one to three times a day, whereas it is 
necessary to inject efedron as many as 15 times a day. 
  Marijuana and hashish are being found less and less 
frequently. But, as J. Stradins stated, there is presumably 
still quite a considerable volume of trade in these substances. 
  The most alarming aspect today is the appearance of cocaine. 
The appearance of this drug is linked primarily with the 
stabilization of the lat, and there is good reason to think that 
when the lat becomes convertible, it will be possible to 
purchase any drug in any amount throughout Latvia. 
  A letter has been sent to the prime minister, in which he 
was 
asked to support the operation "Poppy," similar to one that was 
organized in 1987, when the growing of poppy was outlawed, 
reported J. Stradins. In those times, local authorities used to 
organize campaigns to destroy them. Taking into account the 
present situation in Latvia, a similar action is now being 
planned. Stradins said: We understand we cannot gain much by 
restrictions, but to some extent it is a cry of despair. 
  Data from Riga police and the Ministry of Home Affairs 
suggest that there might be between 2,500 and 6,000 drug users 
in Latvia. According to J. Stradins, these numbers are more 
close to reality than the number of addicts estimated by the 
medical service -- 800. 
  The most unfavorable situation is in Olaine, also in the 
district of Riga, in Riga itself (mainly in the suburb of 
Latgale), Ogre, Jurmala, and Tukums. 
  Drug abuse is widespread mostly among "Russian speakers," as 
well as among people from the Caucasus, and Gypsies. Between 80 
and 90 percent of addicts receiving medical help are Russian 
speakers. 
  The most important element in the fight against drugs is 
prevention, as was stressed by all members of the conference 
[not further identified]. It is more effective than any control. 
Therefore the news that an agreement has been reached with the 
Scandinavian organization "Parents Against Drugs" to hold their 
plenary meeting in Riga on 25 February, with the aim of 
establishing a similar organization in Latvia, is very 
encouraging. The experience of these states shows clearly that 
parents can help their children much more, if they have met, 
discussed their problems together, and exchanged experiences.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 09, BNS -- The Latvian society is not 
ready for a mass integration of non-Latvians on the basis of the 
language skills, said MP [member of parliament] Dzintars Abikis, 
of the parliament Latvia's Way faction. 
  The priority in naturalization should be granted to those 
non-citizens who have finished educational establishments with 
Latvian teaching language rather than to the spouses of 
citizens, as stipulated by the present bills, said Abikis. 
  Non-citizens should take another state language exam before 
getting citizenship because the present language commissions 
often issue undeserved language certificates, he said. 
  In addition, state language inspectors in Riga have faced 
violence on several occasions, said Abikis. An inspector in the 
Latgale district, for example, was severely beaten recently. 
  Abikis claims that the brutal acts are directed against the 
Latvian state and evidence of reluctance of part of non-Latvians 
to respect the Latvian nation and its language. 
  The State Language Center has applied to the Justice 
Ministry 
in a bid to receive salary additions from collected fines for 
breaking of the state language law. State inspectors presently 
receive 59 lats per month. 
  The language learning among adults proceeds with 
difficulties 
but the younger generation gives grounds to hope for the better, 
said Abikis. In the largest cities, especially in Daugavpils 
and Kraslava, many non-Latvian children learn in 
Latvian-language schools. 
  The Latvia's Way faction believes that professional training 
in Latvia should fully transfer to the Latvian teaching 
language, said Abikis.

<F P=106> [Valentin Zhdanko report under the "Belarus" rubric: "Many </F>
Parties Back General Political Strike. Its Organizers Discuss 
Transition Government Composition"] 
  [Excerpts] The initiative by strike committees and 
independent trade unions on holding a general political strike 
scheduled to start on 15 February has already been supported by 
many official trade unions, as well as by eight political 
parties of national- democratic orientation. The country's 
biggest opposition force -- the Belarus People's Front -- 
promises to assist actively in the organization and holding of 
the strike. [passage omitted] 
  A joint meeting of representatives of the political parties, 
movements, and trade unions that will take part in the strike 
discussed the question of the composition of a transition period 
government under whose control, according to the organizers' 
plans, early elections should be held. Gennadiy Karpenko, 
leader of the Party of National Accord and mayor of the city of 
Molodechno, was nominated for the position of head of a 
coalition cabinet of ministers -- a candidature to the liking of 
the majority of forces supporting the political strike. He was 
nominated in the recent elections for the post of parliament 
speaker but declined to take part in campaigning for the seat.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 27] </F>
  [Text] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich said his 
Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin "will arrive in Minsk no 
later than next week." Kebich pointed out that "there should be 
no question of the exchange rate of the Belarusian and Russian 
currencies until the interstate agreement is signed." 
  The rate of exchange of Belarusian rubles and the timeliness 
of the changeover are the main issues for the two countries' 
expert groups to solve, according to the Belarusian prime 
minister. 
  The forthcoming signing of the Russo-Belarusian agreement to 
merge the two countries' monetary systems "is of no threat to 
the sovereignty of Belarus," Kebich told a meeting of 
industrialists in Minsk on Tuesday. 
  Speaking on the launch of an indefinite political strike in 
Belarus, which independent unions scheduled for February 15, the 
prime minister described this action as "an attempt to disrupt 
the signing of the vital documents on the unification of the 
monetary systems of Russia and Belarus." 
  Meanwhile, according to Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr 
Shokhin, the development of the mechanisms aimed at unifying the 
two countries' monetary systems is likely to be completed by the 
end of February. After this we shall be able to develop our own 
approach to the problem, said Shokhin. He believes that the 
unification of the monetary systems is only possible if the two 
countries' national interests are taken into account. 
  Sources close to the Russian Cabinet have told Interfax that 
Moscow links the possibility of the arrival in Minsk of a 
Russian delegation to finalize the monetary-union talks to the 
completion of the work by experts on the problem. 
  A representative of the Russian delegation which recently 
returned from Minsk has told Interfax that the Russian side 
suggested at the talks the exchange of rubles for belarusian 
national coupons in line with the non-cash rate of 1:3, and in 
cash 1:1. Belarus insists on the exchange of both cash and 
non-cash money at a rate of 1:1. 
  The chairman of the Duma subcommittee for credit and 
monetary 
policies, former Russian finance minister Boris Fedorov believes 
that Russia's benefits from the two systems unification are 
doubtful. If there are any, these are political benefits, he 
said. 
  In an interview with Interfax, Fedorov said that Belarus, 
which practically had yet to carry out any free market reforms 
and which is now in an energy crisis with an inflation rate of 
45% over the past two months, is, no doubt, interested in 
receiving the more stable Russian currency. But what is 
Russia's benefit, I do not understand, he said. 
  Fedorov believes that after he stepped down, Yegor Gaydar 
left and the speaker of the Belarusian parliament Stanislav 
Shushkevich resigned, there are no longer any forces capable of 
preventing the hasty unification of the two countries' monetary 
systems. He also believes it necessary to investigate the 
possible consequences of the unification for Russia and to 
discuss the problem at the Duma's planning and budgetary 
committee.

<F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Viktor Sakhankov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk, 9 Feb -- A meeting took place today between 
Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich and the republic's 
industrialists. The prime minister acquinted the industrialists 
with the protocol of the expert commission for the merger of the 
monetary systems of Belarus and Russia. The prime minister said 
that the statements by opponents of this action, in which it is 
alleged that it runs counter to the republic's interests, are 
unfounded. When the appropriate agreements between the heads of 
the two governments are signed, Belarus will receive fuels at 
prices which are identical to those paid by Russian consumers. 
There will be no need for customs barriers and duties. 
  In the course of the three months after signing the 
agreements, the changeover to payments of wages of those 
employed in the budget-funded sphere in accordance with a single 
wage network will be enacted in Belarus. It is intended to 
carry out settlements between the banks of Belarus and Russia 
via correspondent accounts, opened by commercial banks with one 
another, or via accounts of the National bank of Belarus and the 
Russian Central Bank. The protocol provides for a number of 
jointly elaborated mechanisms and procedures for their 
implementation during the difficult process of fully merging the 
two states' monetary systems.

  [Text] Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] Secretary Viktar

leadership has received unofficial information concerning 
attempts by the Council of Ministers to ban the activities of 
the BNF and to strip leader Zyanon Paznyak, of the legislative 
opposition, of his deputy powers. The opposition newspaper 
SVABODA reported the same in a recent issue. According to 
SVABODA, the Cabinet of Ministers leadership have requested that 
the Prosecutor's Office, KGB, and the Interior Ministry find 
legal grounds to ban the BNF. The Prosecutor's Office 
reportedly has been asked to consider the possibility of 
initiating criminal proceedings against Zyanon Paznyak. 
However, as has been pointed out by Viktar Ivashkevich, the BNF 
leadership thus far knows nothing about any concrete legal 
measures taken by law enforcement bodies.

  [Text] Minsk -- The law "On Alternative Service" has "been 
unlucky" in the Belarusian parliament. It passed its first 
reading over a year ago. But in its second reading it did not 
garner the required number of votes. Recently another attempt 
was made to legalize alternative service. 
  But the deputies heeded the opinion of republic Defense 
Minister Colonel General Pavel Kozlovskiy, who stated that the 
time for this law has "still not come." The Armed Forces, he 
said, are experiencing a severe shortage of draftees and, if 
alternative service is now allowed, the situation as regards 
bringing the Army up to strength with soldiers and sergeants 
will become extremely complicated.

the Czech Republic, and Vladimir Radkevich, head of the 
Belarusian Government's Foreign Trade Committee, have signed an 
agreement in Prague on trade and economic relations between 
Belarus and the Czech Republic. The document provides for the 
liberalization of foreign trade, settlement of hard currency 
payments, and direct economic links between the partners. Czech 
experts believe that the agreement will allow other agreements 
to be signed in specific areas of cooperation, such as support 
and protection of investments and the prevention of dual 
taxation.

<F P=106> [Svetlana Gamova report: "Snegur Warns: Provocations </F>
Possible in Dniester Region"] 
  [Text] Chisinau -- The Moldovan president has made an 
appeal on national television to residents of the Dniester 
Region in which he warned of possible provocations in the region 
during the election period and laid responsibility for their 
consequences at the door of Tiraspol's leaders. 
  M. Snegur pointed out that the "sociopolitical situation in 
eastern parts of the republic has once deteriorated and the 
unconstitutional authorities in the Dniester Republic [as 
published] are constantly blocking a solution to the conflict. 
According to him, armed formations of the Dniester Region have 
been brought into the security zone, previously part of the 
combat zone, which is now controlled by peacekeeping forces. 
This is a gross violation of the agreement that the Russian and 
Moldovan presidents signed in 1992. He named the places where 
these armed detachments are based: Bendery and the outlying 
village of Parkany. 
  In Snegur's opinion, the situation is being aggravated by 
the 
special regime in force on the Left Bank along with the 
reinforced border and customs posts on highways and bridges 
across the Dniester. The Dniester Region authorities' 
reluctance to resolve the conflict was cited as a crucial 
factor. Moreover, M. Snegur does not rule out the idea that 
"there will be various provocations that may end in bloodshed." 
  The president urged the population of the Dniester Region 
and 
all people of goodwill to "influence those who want to embroil 
us in a bloody conflict." 
  Judging by the atmosphere in Tiraspol, people here are 
afraid 
that uncontrollable situations may arise, thus accounting for 
the introduction of a special regime in the region. 
  The information cited in the Moldovan president's appeal is 
backed up by a statement from the Moldovan delegation on the 
Joint Monitoring Commission [JMC], which is monitoring the 
security zone. The Dniester side has submitted its 
counterarguments to the commission. According to V. Krylov, 
cochairman of the JMC, who heads the Russian mission, there have 
been plenty of these counterstatements and they are not just 
confined to the above two spots -- Bendery and Parkany. The 
facts cited are being checked out by the tripartite military 
command of the peacekeeping forces, and the JMC will be able to 
draw its conclusions on the basis of the command's report. 
  The Russian delegation, which is mediating in resolving the 
conflict, is aware of the edgy election atmosphere and the 
sides' desire to derive the maximum advantage from it, according 
to the Russian cochairman of the JMC. But the main thing today 
is to preserve tranquillity and the peace that has been 
established, creating conditions for political solutions. 
  Bendery Garrison Commandant A. Vostrikov noted that, 
according to his information, the JMC has not established that 
there are armed formations in the city apart from those for 
which the agreement makes provision.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Denidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau February 9 TASS -- The parliament of the 
Moldovan breakaway Dniester Republic called on the United 
Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE) and heads of the CIS states to send observers for "the 
objective assessment of the situation". 
  The Tiraspol leaders consider this has become necessary due 
"to increasing attacks of Chisinau on the Dniester 
administration". 
  Thus the parliament fired back the Wednesday statement of 
Moldovan President Mircea Snegur, who accused Tiraspol of 
attempts to aggravate the socio-political situation and block 
the implementation of the Moscow agreement on the peaceful 
settlement of the conflict, signed in August 1992. 
  "The presence of international observers may prevent 
economic 
siege and a new military conflict in the region", the parliament 
statement said. 
  The document reiterated that the Dniester province will not 
take part in Moldova's parliamentary elections scheduled for 
February 27. 
  The situation is apparently hotting up in the Dniester 
province. "A single provocation will be enough to have a 
military conflict unleashed", Valeriy Prudnikov, chief of police 
in the Dniester town of Bendery told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
Prudnikov complained that the Dniester leaders "stur up local 
population against the police", which is subordinate to Chisinau 
Interior Ministry. 
  Dniester is not the only pain in the back for Chisinau. 
Leaders of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic in the southern 
part of Moldova insist that the 14th Russian Army deployed in 
the former Soviet republic must be granted the status of 
peace-keeping forces. 
  This will prevent Chisinau's possible attempts to solve by 
force the problem of Moldova's two provinces -- Dniester and 
Gagauzia, said a statement signed by Gagauz leaders. 
  The Army itself warned all sides against "the illusions to 
solve the conflict by force". The statement of the command of 
the 14th Army circulated on Wednesday stressed that "organizers 
of armed provocations from both banks (of the Dniester River) 
will get severe punishment for any attempt to unleash a new 
conflict". 
  The military appealed to politicians to seek for a political 
settlement of "all difficult but still solvable problems" basing 
on the Moscow accords.

  [Text] Chisinau ROMPRES, 9/2/1994 -- The appeal of 
President Snegur to citizens of Moldova of 7 February denotes a 
provocation Chisinau has prepared against Tiraspol, declared to 
BASA Alexandru Caraman, Dniester vice-president. The appeal 
warns about possible new clashes and bloodshed in Dniester 
region. In the opinion of Caraman, "Moldovan authorities will 
provoke bloodshed and blame Tiraspol leaders, pretending to be 
doing their best to solve the Dniester conflict." He estimated 
that "the present leadership of Moldova does everything to 
recruit electors from the left bank. Asked to comment the 
information saying that some 40 people from the former Russian 
Security Ministry are engaged in Tiraspol service, Caraman said 
"I do not work in these organs and can neither confirm or deny 
such data."

<F P=106> [Irina Negrea article: "Snegur Gives Moscow Reason for </F>
Satisfaction"] 
  [Text] In the final period of the election campaign for 
parliamentary elections in the Republic of Moldova, the 
conservative, procommunist, and pro-imperial forces, which hold 
political and economic power in Chisinau, have intensified their 
attack. The recent meeting entitled "Our Home -- the Republic 
of Moldova" fulfilled all the functions of former traditional 
congresses of the Communist Party by formulating "directives" 
and "theses" for the coming period. The anti-Romanian 
atmosphere of the proceedings and the anti-unification promoted 
by all speakers triggered lively applause in Moscow. Here is 
how Radio Moscow and Ostankino Television acclaimed the said 
congress: "The participants in the forum condemned the 
political forces and media opposing the state's independence and 
spread national feuding (...) Moldova's President Mircea Snegur 
delivered a profoundly substantiated speech in front of those 
present. The ultra-patriotic slogans supported by a number of 
parties and movements led to a split not only of the people of 
different ethnic origin, but also among the ranks of Moldovans." 
And at the end of the report, which apparently is not linked to 
what was reported before, but which actually testifies to the 
fact that Moscow endorses Chisinau's official stance, it is 
emphasized: "The same day (6 February), Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin signed an intergovernmental draft accord that 
establishes the rules and conditions for the stationing of 
Russian troops on the territory of Moldova." Once again this 
proves that Snegur's previous statements in connection with the 
need for the 14th Army to withdraw were false. 
  Even the organization of the congress (by the so-called 
Civic 
Alliance in Chisinau, a formation that was set up recently, and 
the Government of the Republic of Moldova) does not differ in 
any way from the former measures of defense and security adopted 
by the communists. The proceedings were attended by delegations 
from several countries, including from former Soviet republics; 
Romania was not invited. Access to the congress was very 
restricted. The invitations had been issued by state 
structures. The same procedure was also in force for most of 
the journalists, who, not having the authorities' approval, had 
to withdraw when faced by the cordons of policemen. Chisinau 
radio and television carried live relays of the congress, so 
that the citizens' indoctrination would be more effective. In 
practical terms, the speakers respected the electoral platform 
of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova [PDAM] by trying, 
first and foremost, to slander the pro-union political forces 
and promoting Romania-phobia and an exaggerated, abnormal 
Moldovanism. 
  Adrian Usatai, general director of the national radio 
television in Moldova and leader of the Civic Alliance in 
Chisinau, went as far as to contest the national ideal of the 
country's reintegration, thus questioning -- with sinister 
sarcasm -- the supreme sacrifice accepted by Ilie Ilascu: "Mr. 
Ilascu, it is one thing to defend the integrity of the Republic 
of Moldova in Tiraspol, and another, if you state, in your cage, 
that Romania is your homeland. In what capacity were you there 
and what was the purpose of being in Tiraspol?" 
  Not wanting the Republic of Moldova to become "a province or 
domain of other countries," Dumitru Motpan, PDAM leader, 
supports the presidential point of view militating for an 
independent Republic of Moldova, eventually united with Moldavia 
on this side of the Prut River. 
  During a recent meeting with the electorate of the Cantemir 
Rayon, Motpan said that, after the genuine consolidation of 
Moldova's statehood, the PDAM "will proceed to the unification, 
but not with the whole of Romania, but merely with Romanian 
Moldavia." 
  Unfortunately, the agrarians are the ones who can most 
easily 
manipulate public opinion in villages, both at the 27 February 
1994 elections and during the so-called sociological referendum 
on 6 March 1994, considering that the majority of peasants rely 
on the kolkhoz and sovkhoz leaders, who constantly put pressure 
on them due to the directives received from the "center."

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Andrey Kozyrev and Nursultan Nazarbayev spent about 
three hours in one-on-one talks yesterday. Trustworthy sources 
say that an agreement was not reached on any of the subjects 
under discussion. For this reason, no final documents were 
signed. The issues obstructing relations between Russia and 
Kazakhstan fall into three areas. 
  First, there are legal issues relating to citizenship and 
the 
rights of Russians in Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev once again said no 
to Kozyrev's latest initiative on dual citizenship. The 
possibility of a compromise is being discussed. 
  The second issue is military-political cooperation. 
Kazakhstan is insisting on an economic quid pro quo for the 
removal of nuclear weapons. 
  Third, and lastly, there is Baykonur, which is still a 
stumbling block in relations between the two states. The plane 
carrying the Russian foreign minister's delegation, accompanied 
by Kazakh representatives, has just landed at Krayniy airport, 
Leninsk. 
  Today, Andrey Kozyrev will familiarize himself with the 
situation at Baykonur. The talks are proving difficult. The 
Kazakh side does not agree that Russia should lease the 
Cosmodrome for 99 years. According to some reports, Russia is 
being offered a lease of about 20 years. Russia's Defense 
Ministry regards this as completely unacceptable. 
  Furthermore, Kazakhstan is seeking the demilitarization of 
Baykonur. It does not want to entrust command over it to the 
Russian military authorities. Kazakhstan hopes to carry out a 
global commercial program at the cosmodrome. Naturally, this 
does not accord with Russia's strategic interests either. 
  Kazakhstan's latest bold condition for Russia's use of 
Baykonur was the proposal that, in return for a lease on the 
Cosmodrome, it would receive military equipment from Russia at 
half-price. 
  Finally, Kazakhstan has completely refused to recognize 
Baykonur and a number of test ranges as Russian military bases, 
something that Moscow is insisting on. 
  Nevertheless, we must set an example by proving that we can 
conduct a fruitful dialogue, as well as argue and stake claims, 
Andrey Kozyrev said, probably without feeling especially 
hopeful, judging by the Kazakh side's recent behavior.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Nursultan Nazarbayev by Ye. </F>
Dotsuk: "We Shall Not Divide Into `Ours' and `Theirs'; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Dotsuk] Nursultan Abishevich, in a recent speech 
you said that 1994 will be a turning point for the better for 
Kazakhstan. Yet the start of the year has already been marked 
by soaring prices, inflation, and a decline in the tenge 
exchange rate. In speaking of imminent economic stabilization, 
what are you relying on -- specific calculations and reassuring 
figures on the course of economic reform, or your intuition as a 
politician? 
  [Nazarbayev] I am sure that this year will be a turning 
point 
for Kazakhstan. This is no prediction caused by some flash of 
illumination. It is based primarily on the real advances 
achieved in the course of economic reforms. Despite many 
difficulties and stoppages and even setbacks, the reforms are 
proceeding and are producing tangible results. The main thing 
is that the structure of our economy is being restricted on the 
move. Last year, with an overall decline in industrial 
production, three-fourths of all enterprises nonetheless found a 
way out of the labyrinth of the crisis and ensured an increase 
in physical volumes...in the majority of cases, by developing 
new commodities: ferromanganese, arc-welded pipes, welding 
rods, dozens of types of equipment, chemical output, structural 
and construction materials, television sets, refrigerators, 
vacuum cleaners, and audio and video equipment. We have even 
begun the production of Kazakhstani automobiles, albeit only in 
small batches for the time being. 
  So, while the production of weapons--in which the Soviet 
Union used to trade--or other output for which there is no 
market is being wound down, we do not greatly regret it. We 
will give our attention and support to those who, working for 
Kazakhstan's needs, consistently restructure themselves and 
adapt to market conditions. 
  Of course, all this still does not attest to the existence 
of 
a mixed economy. But for Kazakhstan, where only yesterday the 
public consciousness did not even allow the idea that we could 
produce complex electronically based equipment for ourselves and 
where even people of the older generation, in contrast, for 
instance, to the Baltic countries, had no idea of what private 
ownership was, taking such a step forward in less than two years 
is undoubtedly an achievement. 
  As for inflation and a certain decline in the tenge exchange 
rate, we did take all that into account beforehand. It would be 
naive to say that we can immediately acquire a very hard 
currency. After all, the same thing is happening with the ruble 
and the currencies of the other CIS countries. 
  [Dotsuk] You have always said that sovereignty is not an end 
in itself, that the main thing is a real improvement in people's 
lives. Tell me, Nursultan Abishevich, have you even once 
regretted that the Kazakhstan Government did not agree to 
Russia's "constraining" terms and decided to leave the ruble 
zone? 
  [Nazarbayev] Any state signing particular interstate 
agreements assumes the determination of the obligations to the 
other side. Part of its sovereignty is thus delegated to it. 
Many conditions, including "constraining" ones, as you call 
them, can be accepted if they will bring prosperity and help to 
introduce new technology and so forth. If it were Japan, for 
instance, why should we not waive some principles for the sake 
of the people's welfare. But Russia itself is having a hard 
time right now, and it can hardly consider Kazakhstan's 
interests in some way. The conditions set by A. Shokhin were 
unacceptable to us. He openly asked us to leave the ruble zone, 
and we knew that this was an IMF recommendation. In brief, we 
have no claims against Russia. Ultimately, every state must 
decide its own financial problems freely and independently. 
  Ultimately, the CIS countries should reach a supranational 
currency that will circulate in the CIS. I would very much like 
this to take less than 30 years, as it did in West Europe. 
  [Dotsuk] Nursultan Abishevich, the "Russian theme" has 
become more acute in the Republic now.... 
  [Nazarbayev] I will be frank: This subject is artificially 
being made acute. 
  I will immediately note that I do not accept a concept like 
the "Russian-speaking population." Who among us is not a 
Russian speaker? After all, all Kazakhstan speaks Russian, 
including 99 percent of Kazakhs. And if we do accept this term 
willy nilly, then we have to include in it representatives of 
the more than 100 ethnic groups living in Kazakhstan -- Germans, 
Ukrainians, Belarusians, Greek, Koreans, Dungane.... And the 
context in which this term has usually been used recently in no 
way reflects their national interests. 
  They say that the Kazakh language is driving out Russian, 
primarily in the educational system. But is that the case? 
Right now, 270,000 students are studying in Russian in 
Kazakhstan, which is 78 percent of the total number. More than 
57 percent of the schoolchildren learn only in Russian in 
Kazakhstan--and that is all with Kazakh as the official language 
in the Republic. You must realize that the relevant 
constitutional norm was introduced by no means as a formal sign 
of statehood but primarily because the language of the Kazakhs 
in their motherland was on the verge of disappearing. The 
state's duty and our human duty is to prevent that. 
  Before speaking of migration, let's make a small digression 
into the history of this question. The point is that the 
Kazakhs' ancient land has always received for various reasons -- 
historical, political and social -- representatives of various 
peoples, mainly from the European part of Russia. Since the 
days of Ivan the Terrible and Petr I "fugitives" appeared in our 
land. Later migration began to acquire the nature of Russian 
state policy connected with the creation of a convenient 
bridgehead for military and economic penetration to the East. 
The first mass wave of migrants included peasants from every 
corner of Russia -- victims of land repartition, cossacks called 
to defend the frontiers of the empire. It was then that the 
"Cossack lines" -- the Ural, Siberian, and Gorkiy lines passing 
across the Kazakhs' land -- emerged. The second large wave of 
Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Polish immigrants was caused 
by Stolypin's land reforms and the desire to drag our 
territories into this overall repartitioning. At that time 
nearly 2 million people moved to Kazakhstan. And finally just 
recently masses of volunteers poured into Kazakhstan to develop 
the virgin lands and to work at the "construction sites of the 
century." That was in fact the third and largest stage in 
migration to Kazakhstan. It was then that the demographic 
situation which in principle has persisted to this day was 
determined. 
  Naturally, people came to us with different aims and 
feelings. Whereas the settlers of the first waves tried above 
all to attach themselves to the land and to farm, the latter 
came with a purely worldly aim -- earning money and going back 
home. Naturally, for the deported peoples the desire to return 
home was generally foremost. But irrespective of whom cam here 
and how, by no means the least and perhaps even the first part 
in determining that Kazakhstan became their home was played by 
the Kazakh nation and its traditional qualities like openness, 
hospitality, and good-neighborliness. What, ultimately, is the 
crime of the Kazakhs, more than one-third of whom died during 
the enforced collectivization and who have remained a minority 
in their own motherland? Is it worth mentioning that the 
majority of those who came to Kazakhstan left they were the 
"masters of their lives" here since for them the entire Soviet 
Union (read -- Russia) was their home. But with the enormous 
country's collapse many stereotypes began to change. And 
naturally, many people began to feel they were abroad. There 
was a revival of the view that their stay on our land was 
temporary and there was a desire to return. But has this 
phenomenon--which is entirely natural, given all our 
upheavals--become a massive and overwhelming one? I shall cite 
figures on this score which are by no means exhaustive. Last 
year, more than 200,000 Russians left Kazakhstan. That is 
undoubtedly a lot and was a great loss for Kazakhstan. But we 
must also mention something else: Migration flows in both 
directions have never ceased. Even in the "prosperous" 1980's, 
80,000 to 100,000 people left Kazakhstan every year and slightly 
more came. Last year, too, nearly 160,000 Russians moved 
permanently to the Republic. And they were Russians! And only 
about 60,000 of them were from regions that, to put it mildly, 
are not distinguished by their stability. We must also consider 
that after the creation of Kazakhstan's own armed forces a large 
number of servicemen left Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's army is 
small and officers together with their units naturally left the 
Republic. 
  But it is wrong to speak of some gigantic flow of refugees 
from Kazakhstan unless, of course, you are setting yourself a 
particular aim. There are no refugees at all, there is freedom 
for each person to choose his place of residence. Those are two 
different things. And we receive openly those who come to us. 
The amendments which I recently made to the law on citizenship, 
taking advantage of my additional powers, were indeed connected 
with simplifying the procedure for taking citizenship when 
members of the families of Kazakhstanis move to the republic, 
and not only for them. 
  Of course, I do not say that there are no problems in this 
matter, particularly problems connected with the tyranny of 
bureaucrats who, incidentally, forget their national feelings 
when there is extortion and bribery (a Kazakh takes money from a 
Kazakh, a Russian from a Russian). Russian citizens probably 
are also aware of this. 
  I am very worried by the departure of Germans. More Germans 
than Russians have left the republic. I understand the feelings 
of people seeking to return to their historical homeland, 
especially as the majority did not come to Kazakhstan at their 
own wish. But in talks with Germany's leaders I always raise 
questions of expanding the presence of German business in 
Kazakhstan. We have plenty of land. You only have to work, to 
raise children, to make your family's life a prosperous one. 
And do you need dual citizenship under these conditions? You 
ask what danger it presents to Kazakhstan. It does not present 
a danger to the Kazakhs! You cannot split the multinational 
Kazakhstan society into two parts. You cannot have "ours" and 
"theirs." 
  I suggested and continue to suggest a simple and feasible 
way 
out of the situation: When he moves to Russia let a person 
freely acquire its citizenship. If you come to live in 
Kazakhstan, you acquire Kazakhstan citizenship. And even 
better, introduce within the CIS framework a common document 
enabling people to live wherever they like irrespective of 
citizenship. And then the question of "dual citizenship" will 
disappear of its own accord. 
  [Dotsuk] How is the situation with the CIS taking shape 
today? Do you believe that formation is still promising? 
  [Nazarbayev] I have never considered it unpromising, 
otherwise I would not have put forward so many initiatives for 
the integration, primarily the economic integration, of our 
states. The recent meeting in Ashgabat confirmed that the 
further we go in different directions the more rapidly we will 
feel the need to unite. It seems to me that there are enough 
signed documents regulating work and mutual cooperation within 
the CIS to see us through to the end of the century and it is 
now time to fill work with specific content, unraveling, albeit 
slowly, but nonetheless painstakingly, the knots of 
contradictions which emerged largely artificially over the past 
two years. 
  I do not know, perhaps someone does not like talk of a 
single 
economic area but I have long been suggesting to all neighbors 
that they remove all customs barriers and open up their borders. 
By all means, let us sign a treaty. 
  [Dotsuk] Previously, when the officials of two governments 
could not agree on particular issues, you and Yeltsin would 
intervene and the problems would be resolved. Recently, Yeltsin 
does not seem to be "playing up" to Kazakhstan very much. Should 
we think that your personal relations with him have cooled? 
  [Nazarbayev] I am surprised, although I can imagine why you 
reached that conclusion. Boris Nikolayevich complained that, in 
terms of resolving mutual economic problems unskillfully, our 
governments, ministries, and departments were putting us in an 
awkward position, and he was right. After all, how many 
meetings, talks, and agreements there have been. We met six 
times last year just to discuss the ruble zone! We still did 
not achieve anything. And the heads of state seemed to be 
guilty here. In general, the bureaucrats have not resolved 
anything, not even after our summit meetings, when we reached 
the same opinion on many issues. And the economy is starting to 
live increasingly by market rules and not by orders from above. 
  We maintain relations constantly and consult each other on a 
very broad range of problems. Only for some reason the press 
has stopped reporting that a telephone conversation has taken 
place between the presidents on a particular topic. 
  [Dotsuk] In connection with the abolition of the ruble zone 
can it be said that Russian-Kazakhstani relations have 
nonetheless become more complex? 
  [Nazarbayev] I would not draw that conclusion. It has 
already been reported that we and Russia have concluded a treaty 
on mutual payments in the fuel and energy complex. None of us 
owes anyone anything. We and Russia are equally interested in 
strictly observing our treaty commitments. There are also other 
mutual decisions -- treaties are being prepared on military 
cooperation and joint space projects. Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin's visit to Kazakhstan was fruitful. The talks on 
the ruble zone belong to yesterday. 
  [Dotsuk] A few words about Russian-Kazakh relations in the 
sphere of military cooperation. The situation is obvious: 
Unless Kazakhstan and Russia sign a treaty on military-political 
cooperation and documents on the joint use of former strategic 
projects, both sides will lose out -- Russia is deprived of 
bases for scientific and military tests and for Kazakhstan these 
test ranges become a heavy burden since the republic cannot cope 
with them alone. Is Kazakhstan prepared for serious compromise 
steps to preserve existing unique military-technical complexes? 
  [Nazarbayev] Compromise presupposes mutual concessions, not 
unilateral ones. Kazakhstan has always stated its readiness to 
resolve all problems with Russia on mutually advantageous terms. 
  Of course, the military complexes that have been created 
have 
an enormous scientific and technical potential. And we shall 
preserve it -- on an equal basis with Russia or independently. 
But here we must consider that the Baykonur test ranges and 
cosmodrome in Kazakhstan occupy enormous territories. 
Approximately as much territory as the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Hungary, and the former GDR taken together -- over 13 
million hectares of land artificially removed from economic 
circulation. In addition the military regularly occupied a 
further 3.5 million hectares of agricultural land for their 
experiments. And one can understand people's attitude toward 
these mostly lethal establishments. We know that the fuel for 
the "Proton" booster rocket contains a highly toxic component 
like heptyl, which is in the top danger category. So after 
launching, the missile's separated stages with this heptyl 
simply fall from the sky onto the ground and are no birthday 
present to the local inhabitants. We must calculate the size of 
the territories polluted by this poison. 
  [Dotsuk] Are you not troubled that when Clinton came to the 
CIS he met with all the "nuclear" presidents except the 
Kazakhstan president? 
  [Nazarbayev] My talks with Clinton lie ahead. IN the very 
near future I am to make an official visit to the United States 
at the U.S. President's invitation. And I am not troubled by 
this fact for the simple reason that I had a thorough discussion 
of questions of nuclear arms in the CIS with Albert Gore during 
his visit to Kazakhstan. We also talked of the subject of 
William Clinton's talks in Moscow. In addition back in December 
last year our parliament ratified the decision to accede to the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty without outside pressure. And 
it was these problems that the U.S. President was discussing 
with Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. There was no need for 
Kazakhstan to attend. 
  In conclusion, I want to wish all Russians and KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA readers and journalists happiness, prosperity, and 
health. I would like you always to be objective and to describe 
in a balanced and well-intentioned way how people are living 
throughout the world, including in our country -- the Republic 
of Kazakhstan.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Kozlov under the "Kazakhstan" rubric: </F>
"Almaty Opposes Dual Citizenship, But This Does Not Rule Out 
Further Negotiations"] 
  [Excerpts] Polemics about the question of dual citizenship 
in Kazakhstan have evolved into a fierce political argument. 
[passage omitted] 
  Have the Kazakhstani leaders adjusted their stance on the 
eve 
of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Almaty? 
"No, they have not," said state counselor Tulegen Zhukeyev, who 
in fact shapes Kazakhstan's foreign policy. "Our policy remains 
unchanged. If the Russian side wants to discuss the subject, we 
will continue the dialogue. But I do not think it will reveal 
anything completely new." 
  As for "minor" details concerning the issue, Kazakhstani 
Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko unexpectedly spoke up on the 
matter during his trip around the republic's eastern oblasts. 
In his words, a treaty with Moscow is being drawn up whereby 
every Kazakhstani citizen, if he or she so wishes, will have the 
possibility of obtaining Russian citizenship in Moscow under a 
special procedure that will be simplified as much as possible. 
  This information was confirmed for your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent at the information-analytical center of the 
Kazakhstani president's staff. "I do not think that the 
question of citizenship is a cornerstone in Russian-Kazakhstani 
relations," Marat Tazhin, the center chief, believes. "To all 
appearances, a solution will be found in the form of a 
`postponed' or `dozing' [`dremlyushchiy'] citizenship; at least 
our president has repeatedly said that he wants the problem 
resolved in this particular fashion." 
  According to Marat Tazhin, the procedure for obtaining 
Russian citizenship may boil down to a simple registration for 
ethnic Russians, and for other persons wishing to move to Russia 
the acquisition of citizenship would last no longer than three 
months. "But all this, of course, will be settled at the 
upcoming talks and in the course of concluding treaties," the 
chief of the presidential staff's information-analytical center 
said. [passage omitted] 
  "References to Turkmenistan or Kyrgyzstan in this case are 
inappropriate," thinks Sabit Zhusupov, a sociologist and the 
center's leading analyst. "We have an entirely different 
situation in Kazakhstan. If we agree that dual citizenship is 
really needed, around 60 percent of the state's population will 
turn out to be foreign citizens." Sabit Zhusupov also believes 
that the problem can be resolved completely by concluding 
bilateral agreements that would specify the rights of the two 
countries' citizens and simplify a procedure for changing 
citizenship. "But for the most part these matters are of 
interest for politicians," Sabit Zhusupov claims, "and also the 
intelligentsia. But not for other categories of citizens." 
  An entirely clear view has taken shape in Kazakhstan's high 
echelons of power: It is Russian politicians who are trying to 
add a political tinge to the citizenship question with an 
evident purpose of expanding Russia's sphere of influence into 
Central Asia and making Russophones a sort of "force field" to 
influence local governments. [passage omitted]

  [Summary] Late last week Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko 
visited East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk Oblast. 
  In Leninogorsk the prime minister visited the Riddersky mine 
in the Obruchovskaya valley, which is a big mineral deposit of 
ores with gold, silver, and zinc which can be recovered in big 
amounts with little expenditures. Foreign firms are very 
interested in these deposits. 
  In Ust-Kamenogorsk, the prime minister familiarized himself 
with a new store run by the titanium and magnesium combine. 
This store is currently under construction and is expected to 
be commissioned this year. Mr. Tereshchenko examined samples of 
products from titanium and displayed interest in the way the 
combine tackles its problems in selling the products. He gave 
useful advice on the problem. 
  He also met representatives of parties and public movements 
of the oblast. During the conversation, the head of government 
stressed that the disintegration of economic ties in the former 
USSR influenced all spheres of life. New burdens were placed on 
the nation's shoulders after Kazakhstan had to opt out of the 
ruble zone. In order to tackle the problem, President 
Nazarbayev recently put forward an initiative to create a 
supranational currency -- the altyn, from which all the 
republics could have benefited. 
  The head of government said: "We are aware how complicated 
the situation is. One of the reasons for this are non-payments. 
Enterprises of the oblast have over 1 billion tenge of debts. 
Main debts and counterclaims will shortly be offset. This will 
help to find out insolvent and loss-making enterprises which 
will be declared bankrupt. 
  "Many enterprises ask for loans and demand that power should 
be made cheaper. Kazakhstan will soon receive over 1 billion in 
foreign loans but we will not allow credit issue [sentence as 
received]. The money will be mainly channeled to the economy. 
  "Russia sells us power at virtually world prices and we 
should accelerate the commissioning of another power generating 
unit of Ekibastuz-2 which will allow us to to reduce our import 
of energy. 
  "Our agriculture is inefficient. We have much greater 
production costs per tonne of grain in comparison, say, with 
Canada. We should implement advanced technology in agriculture 
so as to reach a modern production level in in 5-7 years. 
  "We have discussed dual citizenship here. But people of over 
100 nationalities live in Kazakhstan. If we pass the law on 
dual citizenship, what kind of situation will we have in our 
sovereign state? I think we have a different way out. We are 
preparing a treaty with Russia according to which every person 
who leaves Kazakhstan for the Russian Federation will obtain its 
citizenship, and vice versa. In order to stop specialists 
leaving, we are elaborating a document which envisages signing 
5-7 year contracts with a better salary. 
  "The language policy is constantly the focus of attention of 
the state leadership. The president will soon speak very 
precisely on these issues."

  [Text] Almaty February 10 TASS -- The general strike of 
miners of the Karaganda coal-field, probably, will not take 
place, because the Kazakh Government agreed to meet the demands 
of the strike committee. 
  All Kazakh consumers have been ordered to pay debts for 
received fuel within a couple of weeks. National bank and a 
number of commercial banks will grant them certain credits for 
that. 
  Custom duties on export coal deliveries will be abolished 
and 
tariffs on deliveries within the territory of the republic will 
be reduced. 
  However, it will be very difficult to return all the debts 
as 
their sum is astronomical: Only the debt for wages in the 
Karagandaugol totals about 180 million tenge (approximately 16 
million U.S. dollars).

  [Text] Tashkent, 9 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- "The foreign 
ministers of the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Uzbekistan, while reiterating their countries' principled 
position on noninterference in the internal affairs of 
Afghanistan, express profound concern at the new flare-up of the 
armed confrontation there. This development of events harms 
prospects for normalizing the situation in that country," says a 
joint statement on Afghanistan, which was issued here on 8 
February by the foreign ministers of Russia and Uzbekistan. 
  The two countries' foreign ministries, the statement says, 
"call for an end to the fratricidal war in Afghanistan and urge 
all Afghan military-political forces to abandon their reliance 
on force and to embark on a joint search for political 
compromises, for the sake of national consolidation and 
reconciliation." 
  The statement stresses: "The sides consider that the 
conflict 
in Afghanistan, which is a result of internal contradictions in 
that country, threatens security and stability in the region. 
They are seriously concerned at the increased tension on the 
southern borders of the CIS. 
  The foreign ministers of Russia and Uzbekistan support the 
integrity of the Afghan state and the inviolability of its 
borders. They are convinced that a settlement of the existing 
contradictions and a decision on Afghanistan's future 
development is a matter, first and foremost, for Afghans 
themselves. The sides intend to continue maintaining strict 
neutrality and abiding by the principle of noninterference in 
Afghanistan's internal affairs. Russia and Uzbekistan are 
willing to do their utmost to facilitate the achievement of 
these objectives within the framework of general international 
efforts, cooperating with the United Nations and all interested 
states. 
  In this connection, the ministers stressed the timeliness of 
the initiatives that the Uzbek president presented at the 48th 
session of the UN General Assembly concerning a settlement of 
regional conflicts in Central Asia, including the Afghan 
problem. They emphasized their readiness to take part in their 
joint implementation. 
  The sides confirm their readiness to develop goodneighborly 
relations and comprehensive, mutually advantageous cooperation 
with a peaceful, independent, and sovereign Afghanistan in the 
interests of mutual understanding and confidence in the region."

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 09, BNS -- Having attained 
independence, Ukraine will be able to become the third big 
Slavic country in Europe, Lithuanian MP [member of parliament] 
Romualdas Ozolas told a news conference Wednesday [9 February]. 
  In Ozolas' view, together with Poland, Ukraine could 
guarantee stability in Central Europe. The lawmaker said it 
would be expedient to create a security space in Central Europe 
but not a Baltic-Black sea axis. "If an axis is necessary, we 
must talk about an axis from Helsinki to Athens." 
  Ozolas said the role of Poland would considerably increase 
in 
such case and this is why Lithuania needs to clear up its 
relations with Poles. If Lithuania agrees to sign an agreement 
on friendship and cooperation with Poland without even 
mentioning the 1920 occupation of Vilnius and its region by 
Poland, this will mean capitulation, he said. History can be 
presented in a form acceptable to both sides, the lawmaker said. 
  Commenting on a seminar of Baltic and Nordic lawmakers in 
Riga last week, Ozolas said its participants pointed out a sharp 
turn in Russia's policy with respect to the Baltic states. He 
said the change can be regarded as "a stage of the cold war." 
  Ozolas said Russia's unwillingness to withdraw its troops 
from Latvia and Estonia proves that deoccupation slows down and 
tendencies of militarization begin to emerge. "Kaliningrad 
covers Lithuania, St. Petersburg -- Estonia, and the Skrunda 
base in Latvia would be the third point." 
  He said the Riga seminar agreed that an agreement on Russian 
military transit would lead toward military cooperation with 
Russia.

  [Text] Straight after President Brazauskas signed the 
document "Partnership for Peace" in Brussels, the document which 
envisages Lithuania's gradual integration into NATO, a 
high-powered delegation from that military organization arrived 
in Vilnius. The visitors -- generals and colonels -- will 
instruct their Lithuanian colleagues in the rational use of 
resources for the country's defense. In any event, as the 
guests and their hosts stressed, all spending will pursue one 
aim -- the intensive rapprochement of Lithuania's military, 
economic, and other structures with the corresponding structures 
of the NATO countries. The NATO "landing party" in Vilnius is 
part of the program of synchronized visits by other delegations 
from the military bloc to countries in central and Eastern 
Europe. The left-wing opposition is asking this question: 
Shouldn't a decision as portentous as entry into NATO have been 
taken only after a referendum of the people on this question?

  [Text] A free trade agreement by the European Union with 
all three Baltic states will come into force on 1 January 1995, 
Baltic News Service reports. 
  According to experts, the decision adopted last Monday by 
the 
Council of Ministers of the European Union in Brussels, grants 
some privileges to Lithuania and Latvia. European markets will 
be open to Lithuanian and Latvian exports, but imports will be 
restricted for several years. Estonia intends to trade with the 
European Union without any restrictions. 
  According to officials at the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, this decision by the European Union will help Lithuania 
to protect some branches of industry that are so far unable to 
compete with the European producers. Observers think that 
Estonia, liberalizing trade with the European Union in a more 
radical way, will not leave behind its neighbors in striving for 
membership in the European Union. 
  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should sign together [word 
indistinct] agreement with the European Union and later become 
members of this organization.

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 433] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 9, ELTA -- Presidential annual report 
about the current situation in Lithuania and Lithuania's 
internal and foreign policy was delivered to Seimas [parliament] 
members. President is obligated to make the annual report by the 
Constitution. 
  On February 10 President Brazauskas will present 
commentaries 
on the report. The draft agenda gives half an hour for 
Brazauskas to speak. Then he will answer to the questions asked 
by Saeimas members. 
  The presidential annual report consists of approximately 70 
pages. 
  In the report Brazauskas notes that the current political 
situation in Lithuania has become calmer after the period of 
looking for enemies passed. The efficient work of Saeimas was 
instrumental in stabilizing the political situation, although 
some contradictions existing in the society is reflected in 
Saeimas as well. Brazauskas expresses regret that parliamentary 
competition among political parties often has destructive 
results. 
  According to Brazauskas, one of the most important problems 
is restructuring of the state apparatus. "What we need is not 
many, but professional state officers", Brazauskas admits. This 
must be achieved not by apealing to morals, but by adopting a 
law on state officers. 
  Brazauskas suggests that the legal system should be reformed 
as soon as possible because of the increasing crime rates. The 
report includes statistics -- last year's crime rates increased 
by 6.6 times as compared with 1992. 
  The report says that at present 14 thousand people are in 
the 
military service in Lithuania. Brazauskas notes that this 
number must be the limit which should not be exceeded. Instead 
the intellectual potential of the people in the military service 
should be increased alongside with a better material supply. 
  Brazauskas considers the economic situation and says that 
the 
inflation decreased from 1163 percent in 1992 to 32 percent in 
1993. 
  He expressed regret that investments into the Lithuanian 
economy were rather small. Foreign investments did not add much 
to the Lithuanian economy as well. 
  Until 1994 Lithuania received 430 million US dollars in 
foreign loans. This year it must pay the interest rates which 
will make 17 million dollars. But Brazauskas denied statements 
of some economists that all the credits are used only for the 
food purchase. 
  Brazauskas points out positive results in Lithuanian foreign 
policy, the unity of the three Baltic States among them. A new 
formula "three plus five" has been strengthening its position in 
the foreign policy. This is cooperation between the three 
Baltic and five Nordic countries. 
  The report notes that "rapprochement between Lithuania and 
European Union would make positive influence on the life of 
people". Thus, the agreement on free trade between Lithuania and 
European Community is considered by Brazauskas as a priority in 
Lithuanian foreign policy. He hopes that it will be signed in 
the middle of this year and will come into force in 1995. In 
the next stage of the relations with EC Lithuania should sign 
the agreement on associated membership. 
  Brazauskas admits that at present a new page has been opened 
in the history of the Lithuanian-Russian relations. However, 
issues of the compensating the harm which was done during the 
years of occupation will remain on the agenda of the 
negotiations with Russia. Brazauskas suggests forming a special 
group at the Foreign Ministry which will deal with the issues of 
compensation. Brazauskas emphasizes that Lithuania objects to 
giving a mandate by the United Nations for Russia according to 
which Russia will be granted a right to maintain peace keeping 
in the former USSR territories.

<F P=106> [Report by the Independent Strategic Research Center: "Have </F>
We Already Reached the Bottom of the Pit?"] 
  [Excerpts] I. The Point of Departure and Our Hopes 
  The first year of Prime Minister A. Slezevicius' government 
is drawing to a close. Undoubtedly, Lithuania's current social 
and economic situation depends largely on objective reasons. A 
deep crisis has enveloped all states of the former Soviet Union 
and countries in its zone of influence without exception. 
However, it is no less obvious that a country's situation also 
depends on the wisdom, competence, and subordination of 
government institutions, on the so-called subjects of the 
management system. 
  The vital hopes of Lithuanian inhabitants which they pinned 
on the new government (formed by the Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party, which won the elections) were substantiated. First of 
all, people expected that the declines in industry and 
agriculture, which came to light after the declaration of 
independence and the introduction of hasty and ill-considered 
reform, would be prevented. They also hoped that the government 
would manage to halt the drop in living standards. Lithuanian 
inhabitants placed particularly large hopes on more effective 
fights against crime, corruption, and shadow structures plaguing 
the country. 
  We would be biased if we overlooked the positive efforts of 
the current government to direct Lithuania's economic and social 
development toward a positive outcome, and, first of all -- the 
introduction of the litas, the restraint of inflation, the 
vitalization of political and economic relations with foreign 
countries, and so on. However, have the expectations of 
Lithuanian residents been justified, if only partially, over 
this past year? 
  We are also raising this question because the political 
opposition is always ready to transform the accumulated social 
tensions and mistrust into ultimatums demanding early Seimas 
[parliament] elections, which, we are convinced, would only 
aggravate our country's social situation even more. 
  That is why, in the name of Lithuania's future and its 
citizens' concord, it is important to assess the work 
accomplished by the government and its subordinate structures 
and the country's current economic and social situation 
objectively, without any embellishments or cover-ups. This must 
be done not to pass judgment on the government's activities but 
to search collectively for more effective resolutions to the 
current situation on the basis of the conducted analysis. 
<H5>  II. The Fall Syndrome </H5>
  Beginning its work, the government understood the difficult 
condition of Lithuania's economy and the people's low living 
standards. [passage omitted] 
  The new government managed to halt the decline in people's 
living standards. According to the Statistics Department, the 
average monthly increase of prices and tariffs for consumer 
goods in 1993 was 9.2 percent, while that of the average monthly 
wage was 10.7 percent. Real wages, which dropped by 69 percent 
in 1992 against those in 1990, were already stabilized in early 
1993 and began to grow slightly thereafter. The average wage in 
November was approximately $64, that is, it rose by $36 in 
comparison with February. 
  One must also state, however, that the living standards of 
the majority of Lithuanian people remain unjustifiably low, and 
that positive changes fail to eclipse the generally depressing 
picture. The comparative analysis allows us to draw the 
conclusion that the larger half of the employed population in 
Lithuania received lower wages than the real subsistence minimum 
(170 litai). 
  We hardly have any reason to state that a positive 
breakthrough has occurred in the so-called policy of culture 
(incidentally, in the organization of education, science, and 
health care). 
  The criminal situation has not yet been stabilized, and the 
number of unsolved crimes has not been reduced. [passage 
omitted] 
  In our opinion, the key reason for the current social 
situation and its possible deterioration in the future is the 
continuing dangerous decline in Lithuania's industrial and 
agricultural production. For example, in 1993, sales of 
industrial production plunged by 46 percent, those of cattle, 
poultry, and milk -- by 30 and 12 percent, respectively. The 
volume of construction and retail turnover skidded by 40 and 37 
percent. 
  Thus, there is a basis for stating that the decline in 
industrial and agricultural production is continuing and even 
gaining momentum, and that the so-called "bottom of the pit" has 
not yet been reached. This fact is also dangerous in terms of 
hiding in itself and bringing ever closer an outburst of the 
most painful effect -- mass unemployment. In 1993 alone, hidden 
unemployment in industry effected about 335,000 people. 
[passage omitted] 
  III. Looking for Ways Out 
  One of the key reasons for the crisis we are experiencing is 
that the laws of a command economy ceased to operate in 
Lithuania, while those of a market economy have not yet begun to 
function. This is a peculiar "death zone" from which one can 
get out only by applying special tough measures of state 
regulation. The liberalization of prices under conditions of 
macroeconomic instability and a high level of monopolistic 
capital have highlighted the position of the monopolistic 
capital that overshadows the emerging shoots of an open market. 
The power of the Energy Ministry, whose price policy is leading 
producers to bankruptcy, or the monopolistic dictate of food 
processing enterprises to farmers could serve as examples. 
Meanwhile, the essence of state regulation or antitrust measures 
is that a flexible financial and credit policy should create 
equal conditions for competition among different economic units. 
  Positive moves in improving people's social situation are 
largely associated with the introduction of the litas and a 
tough monetary policy. However, there are also some shadow 
elements in this sphere of economic policy. It need not be 
reiterated what negative effect the artificially high litas 
exchange rate exerts on Lithuania's industry. The current 
credit system may have the most negative effect on producers. 
Actually all enterprises are indebted and driven to bankruptcy 
by force by remarkably high credit interest rates, and they are 
choking in the financial policy loop. Given the fact that a 
large part of the current budget revenues (more than one-third) 
comes from industrial enterprises, we can understand what is in 
store for Lithuania if the activities of banks destroy the 
financial matters of industrialists. We do not mention the loop 
of financial settlements on Lithuania's agriculture which is no 
less painful. 
  At the same time, we are convinced that there are certain 
reserves for a more rational utilization of the organizational 
possibilities of the monetary and fiscal policy. First of all, 
this applies to the necessity of implementing radical and 
well-considered reform of the financial and credit system. The 
analysis of various draft laws regulating the financial process, 
which are either in preparation or under review, shows that they 
are drafted without a unified approach or system. [passage 
omitted] 
  One must admit with regret that thus far we have only talked 
about reform in the tax system. Our analysis of the delayed 
draft law "On the Principles of Taxes" has revealed that it was 
created without a well-considered concept. The absence of the 
latter is also responsible for the ambitious debates on the 
declaration of incomes. One could add that tax laws are drafted 
without coordinating them with the law on banks, tariffs, and so 
on. One must also admit that the current government has 
appeared incapable of properly controlling the collection of 
taxes, by leaving a large share of the state budget to shadow 
structures, the so-called uncontrolled free trade, and corrupt 
and impudent officials. 
  Undoubtedly, the privatization of industry and agriculture 
could also be ascribed to the unexhausted reserves for improving 
Lithuania's economic and social situation. The fact that former 
governments arranged the privatization of state assets as a 
campaign of property distribution is a well-known fact. There 
have been several public statements that the privatization of 
state property for investment coupons is economically 
ineffective. 
  Despite the carelessness and obvious mistakes in privatizing 
the state property, no program for the upgrading of reform was 
drafted, the experience of this process was not analyzed and 
assessed critically, and the remaining unprivatized assets were 
not inventoried. [passage omitted] 
  Other unutilized possibilities should also be mentioned. 
Little was accomplished in developing small and medium-sized 
businesses. The faults of the monetary and fiscal policy 
prevented the influx of foreign investments. The problem of 
settlements among economic entities both inside the country and 
with partners in the CIS was not resolved. Foreign policy 
related to the national economy was conducted rather 
ineffectively. The free trade agreements among the Baltic 
states and with Belarus and Russia were not properly applied. 
The drafting of the concept of economic restructuring was 
protracted, to say nothing of its implementation. It is 
actually impossible to conduct a flexible customs policy without 
a clear concept of restructuring. 
  Everyone understands the important role played by the 
competence of government officials, and an honest understanding 
and performance of duties in the state's life and the 
functioning of its structures. The world knows a number of 
examples when these traits decided the defeat of a serious 
crisis. Is everything being done to achieve the impeccable 
level of such traits and duties, even under the current cultural 
conditions? Are plans for the training of government officials 
responsible enough? There are serious grounds to doubt a 
positive response. 
  IV. The State's "Achilles' Heel" 
  It is necessary to deal with agrarian reform separately. 
  In its April 1993 statement, the current government noted 
aptly that agrarian reform was most often conducted by 
administrative methods through imperfect laws, that it was much 
too politicized, that the ill-considered restoration of land was 
going on under the cover of reform, and that former economic 
structures were heedlessly destroyed. Therefore, unpromising 
small farms measuring from 7 to 8 hectares began to emerge. 
What can be their future and role in Lithuania's economy? 
  Being aware of the advantages of large and technologically 
well-equipped farms, nevertheless, the government lacked 
determination in correcting the forerunners' mistakes. The 
actual reason for unsuccessful agrarian reform begun by the 
former Supreme Council was its goals which were incorrect in 
principle. The restoration of land was turned into an end in 
itself. Unfortunately, even after the current government 
upgraded land reform and the law on property restoration, the 
restitution of land has remained the same goal in itself. 
Attempts to introduce conditions for land ownership proved 
futile. The trouble is that the privatization of land was not 
included in agrarian reform as its integral part. Thus far, 
agrarian reform has not been directed at creating an 
economically more effective and competitive agricultural system. 
[passage omitted] 
  It should be stressed that the ill-considered and 
erroneously 
implemented Lithuanian agrarian reform not only ruins production 
but also sets people against each other. Even farmers are more 
opposed to the government today than landless peasants. 
Instances of social discord, as the effects of unwise economic 
and social decisions, are becoming more frequent in Lithuania's 
rural areas. Such conditions cannot be ignored because they are 
one of the key sources of general social tension and political 
opposition, as well as of disappointment and apathy in Lithuania. 
  By mobilizing all intellectual potential, it is necessary to 
return to the basic laws on agrarian reform. A seriously ailing 
countryside also poses a threat to Lithuania's nation and 
statehood. 
<H5>  V. Lithuania, Were Are You Going? </H5>
  We repeat once again: There is no reason to believe that the 
one-year activities of A. Slezevicius' government alone are 
responsible for the current situation. We should hardly doubt 
the fact that his government sincerely tried to fulfill its 
duty. It is unlikely that a coalition government could improve 
the situation if the former legacy with its structural, 
functional, and mental basis remained. 
  There are serious grounds to state that thus far ministries 
and other offices have not become centers of the state's 
intellectual and organizational activities that could exert 
essential and qualitatively new influence on the strengthening 
of statehood. [passage omitted] 
  We claim that reform in the bureaucratic government system 
inherited from the past has become protracted, and that the 
entire state system of economic management remains seriously 
sick, with new symptoms of the disease emerging. 
  In general, thus far, there has not been any more definite 
vision of the lines along which the Lithuanian nation should 
develop its statehood. What are the social goals of the 
restored state? Will the "free market" continue to expand, and 
will the so-called libertarianism (civilized anarchy) take root? 
Will Lithuania orient itself consistently toward the model of a 
state of social accord, welfare, and citizens' democracy? Will 
it always glance at other states and copy their manners, 
stereotypes, and norms, or will it, nevertheless, show more 
determination in looking for the forms of self-awareness 
(self-organization) that are more suitable to our identity and 
national character, and that would strengthen not only the 
chances for the survival of the Lithuanian nation, but also for 
its more extensive contribution to world culture? [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Officials of Lithuania and Belarus ended a meeting 
in Vilnius late on Tuesday by agreeing on a package of 
agreements on mutual travel regulations. 
  Vilnius announced last fall that citizens of all CIS states 
except Belarus would need entry visas to visit the country. 
Entry visas for Belarusians were to be imposed from January 1, 
but later rescheduled for March 1. 
  Foreign ministry officials and experts on both sides have 
now 
agreed on the wording of interim agreements on travel 
regulations, head of the Lithuanian foreign ministry's consular 
department Rimantas Sidlauskas told Interfax. Agreement was 
also reached on simplifying the procedure of border crossing for 
each other's citizens residing in border areas, 
  Sidlauskas described the deal as interim because the two 
sides are still to demarcate more than a 700 km-long border 
separating them. 
  From March 1, Belarusian travellers can apply for entry 
visas 
to Lithuania at the consular department of the Lithuanian 
embassy in Minsk and at border checkpoints in emergencies. 
  Citizens of Belarus and other CIS states may also use 
letters 
of invitation instead of visas until June 1. 
  One-time or multiple-use passes will be issued to the 
residents of border areas on both sides. 
  The package deal is to be signed soon, Sidlauskas said.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 9 Feb -- The Georgian Foreign Ministry has 
issued a statement saying that events in Abkhazia in recent days 
clearly hinder the process of a peaceful settlement of the 
conflict in that region. 
  It has become known, the document says, that during their 
latest advance on 7-8 February, the Gudauta separatists used 12 
items of heavy machinery, howitzers, and Grad installations as a 
result of which six villages in Galskiy [Gali] Rayon were 
destroyed. More than 100 people were killed, and the homes of 
about 800 families was burned down. People were taken prisoner 
and seized as hostages. 
  This action, the statement says, was carried out on the eve 
of the work in Moscow of a mixed group of experts on the status 
of Abkhazia and on the eve of the return of refugees and 
displaced people to Galskiy Rayon, envisaged by the results of 
the Geneva talks, and was planned with the clear aim of 
preventing the return of the refugees. These actions not only 
contradict the resolutions of the Security Council but also 
pursue the aim of hindering the process of normalization of 
Russian-Georgian relations. 
  Expressing a resolute protest in connection with the crude 
violations of the Geneva accords, the Georgian Foreign Ministry 
calls on the United Nations, the CSCE, and the Russian 
Federation to activate all the mechanisms at their disposal to 
prevent any further escalation of the conflict, which threatens 
peace and stability throughout the Caucasus region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Giorgiy Chanturiya, leader of the </F>
National-Democratic Party, by SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA correspondent 
Beso Tskhoragueli; place and date not given: "The View of the 
National-Democrats"] 
  [Text] Giorgiy Chanturiya, leader of the 
National-Democratic Party, delivered a statement on the 
necessity of launching a partisan war in Abkhazia. Our 
correspondent asked him to comment further on this. 
  [Chanturiya] We have lost the war. This is a fact. 
Moreover, Georgia is not in a position today to wage a 
full-scale war. We will be ready to do this only when we have a 
full-fledged state and, as a consequence of this, a real 
battleworthy army. The only thing that we can really do is to 
wage a partisan war. We should not allow our enemies to relax 
for a minute. Otherwise, in a year or two, we will be faced 
with new realities with which we will have to come to terms and 
then Abkhazia will also be lost from the legal point of view. 
  [Tskhoragueli] What about the peace talks, the peacekeeping 
forces, the return of the refugees...? 
  [Chanturiya] I am not against peace talks so long as they 
enable us to win time. 
  As for peacekeeping forces, this is a tall story with which 
they are trying to console us. There will be no UN troops 
there. The role of peacekeepers will be fulfilled by the same 
forces that were there before. 
  Only those people who agree to register themselves as 
Abkhazians can return to Abkhazia today.... If we want to lose 
Abkhazia forever and accelerate the process of the Abkhazation 
of Georgians and, finally, legalize the results of the war, we 
should agree to the introduction of Russian troops into 
Abkhazia. If not, I once more repeat that the only way out, 
proceeding from current realities, is a partisan war. 
  [Tskhoragueli] You spoke of antigovernment actions that are 
being prepared. Do you have grounds for making such a statement 
or is this just supposition? 
  [Chanturiya] The new government is repeating many of the 
mistakes that Gamsakhurdia made. The mass media has again been 
monopolized. 
  The population is on the brink of a social explosion and 
there already exist specific forces that are ready to take 
advantage of this. Our party is opposed to any kind of 
confrontations since this would be the final blow for Georgia. 
However, events are developing precisely in this direction. 
"Dark" forces are just waiting for the right climatic 
conditions.
