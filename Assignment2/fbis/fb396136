<F P=106> [Statement by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev; place and date </F>
not given -- recorded; from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] A decision to make ground-attack and bombing strikes 
against positions around Sarajevo would, of course, be bound to 
have very unwelcome consequences. In the first place I would 
say: the international prestige of the United Nations would be 
undermined. That is certain. This action would look like a 
unilateral action to punish the Serbs. Moreover, great losses 
among the civilian population are inevitable. 
  Second, the inflicting of these strikes could trigger a 
large-scale war, and, even worse, these strikes could act as a 
trigger for other states, neighboring states, to be drawn into 
this war.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX "Express"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry on Sunday 
evening assured Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev that 
there would be no air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs within 
the next two days, although the NATO ultimatum expires at 
midnight on Sunday [20 February]. 
  In a telephone conversation, conducted in the presence of 
correspondents from Interfax and Russia's NTV television 
company, Grachev told Perry: "In our opinion, far from all 
political and diplomatic measures have been used." 
  The minister said Russia's 400-strong U.N. contingent around 
1700 GMT was entering Sarajevo, where the commander of the 
Russian airborne forces, Colonel-General Yevgeny Podkolzin, a 
group of Russian Defense Ministry officials and Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin had already arrived. 
  "The use of air forces against any of the parties to the 
conflict must be ruled out. This must be the basis of a 
solution at the present moment," Grachev said. 
  He said Perry agreed with this and said no air strikes would 
be carried out on Monday. Attempts would be made that day to 
establish the exact location of the heavy weapons removed by the 
Serbs, Grachev said. He said the abundant snow was hampering 
the withdrawal of the weaponry. "This factor must come into 
account when decisions are made," he told Perry. 
  Grachev said civilians and Russian troops could be among the 
victims of the air strikes. 
  He made it clear that Moscow could send a reinforcement for 
the U.N. force if the Russian parliament approved it. "We are 
ready to respond to the appeal of the U.N. secretary general to 
send an addition contingent of up to 300 if such a decision were 
approved by the Federal Assembly," he said.

  [Text] Moscow February 21 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev invited the United States to send its 
peace-keepers to Sarajevo to patrol Muslim positions, but U.S. 
Defence Secretary William Perry refused. 
  Grachev told his U.S. counterpart during a telephone 
conversation on Monday that "the position of the Muslim side 
regarding the NATO demands and the presence of the Russian force 
in Sarajevo is not clear for Russia" and warned that any 
provocations against the Russian peace-keepers would result in 
"a sharp aggravation of the situation and will disrupt mutual 
efforts." 
  The presence of U.S. peace-keepers in Muslim areas "would 
strengthen the situation in general and we could have ensured a 
close interaction between our servicemen," Grachev said. 
  However, Perry rejected the invitation.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev today had a 
nearly 40-minute telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of 
Defense William Perry. As before, the two officials discussed 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In the course of the conversation, Grachev proposed a 
contingent of U.S. troops be deployed in areas around Sarajevo 
which are predominantly populated by Bosnian Moslems. In his 
opinion, this would further improve the situation, after Russia 
sent its peacekeepers to the positions of Bosnian Serbs. 
  However, the U.S. Secretary of Defense said the United 
States 
did not plan to deploy its troops in these areas. 
  In turn, Grachev proposed deploying contingents of such West 
European states as Great Britain, France and Germany there. 
Perry promised to discuss the proposal with the other defense 
ministers. 
  Grachev said Russia insisted on the unacceptability of NATO 
air strikes on military installations of any of the warring 
sides. 
  In an interview with journalists after the end of the 
conversation, Grachev said Bosnian Serbs had withdrawn the bulk 
of their heavy hardware from around Sarajevo. He said he was 
confident that the Serbs will accurately fulfil all their 
obligations. 
  Grachev did not rule out the possibility that more Russian 
peacekeepers, including the 27th motor rifle division of the 
Privolzhskiy district and the 46th motor rifle division of the 
Leningrad district, might be deployed in the Sarajevo region, if 
necessary. 
  In an answer to journalists' questions, Grachev said NATO 
air 
strikes on Serb positions seemed very unlikely at the moment. 
He suggested that such strikes may be possible only in case of 
provocations, and are the most likely to be dealt on 
sporadically populated highland areas as "retaliation or 
pressure." He pointed out once again that any air strikes in 
the area were unlikely at the moment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to Russia, </F>
and Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for 
International Affairs, by announcer Nikolay Svanidze in Moscow; 
from the "Details" program -- live, Pickering in English with 
simultaneous translation into Russian] 
  [Text] [Svanidze] Good evening. Our program Details is now 
being broadcast live on Russia's TV. It will focus on the 
Bosnian crisis, in which a peaceful settlement has become 
possible after the initiative put forward by Russia yesterday. 
Today's guests are two politicians: Vladimir Petrovich Lukin, 
the chairman of the Duma Committee for International Affairs 
and, until recently, Russia's ambassador to the United States; 
and Mr. Thomas Pickering, the present U.S. ambassador to Russia. 
My first question is to you, Ambassador: Do you think that 
under the present circumstances the possibility of air strikes 
being delivered on the Serb positions near Sarajevo is still 
real? 
  [Pickering] I think that under the current set of 
circumstances, when the diplomacy of President Yeltsin has made 
a serious difference in the attitude of the Bosnian Serbs, and 
we are working together to carry out the evacuation and control 
of heavy weapons around Sarajevo -- if all this continues to 
successful, then the main problems to be resolved in connection 
with the possible air strikes, will be the questions of 
violating the cease-fire. As you know, such attempts were made 
and the UN secretary general has asked for NATO's help in this 
respect. We hope no one will break the cease-fire. We hope for 
further success of Russian diplomacy. We hope that the process 
will reach a new stage and that we will perform that complicated 
work together and in partnership, which could bring a more 
permanent peace to Bosnia. 
  [Svanidze] I have the same hopes as the ambassador. Now a 
question for you, Vladimir Petrovich. This current achievement 
of the Russian diplomacy -- if everything is resolved 
peacefully, as we all hope it will do -- that will really be a 
great achievement. What effect is this going to have on the 
relations between the legislative and executive branches of 
power? What is the Duma's attitude to this at the moment? I 
mean the Duma as a whole -- Mr. Zhirinovskiy, I know, will think 
it was all his work -- but the Duma as a whole? 
  [Lukin] The Duma, as a whole, is a very complex notion. I 
must say that your suspicions are confirmed. The Liberal 
Democrats leader said today that all good things that are now 
happening or will happen in Bosnia, in Yugoslavia, have come 
about as a result of his visit there. 
  [Svanidze] Sure. 
  [Lukin] We all understand that he is exactly right. I will 
even say that there could not have been any other explanation, 
but the real problem is that I could not see any substantial 
differences in Duma's and our executive power's initial 
approaches to this problem. As you know, during the first days 
of this crisis, when the ultimatum was made, the Duma took a 
decision that said very clearly and unambiguously that it was 
against any sort of ultimatums, and expanding the scope of air 
raids. In the Duma's opinion one cannot reduce air raids and 
shooting by expanding the scope of air raids. 
  At the same time, the Duma stressed the need for a very 
intensive search for political solutions. I think that the 
president and the executive power acted in line with this 
decision, and developments that have taken place or are 
happening now in line with this decision can only upset those 
who are not interested in coordinating the efforts of all the 
elements of the Russian state structure. 
  [Svanidze] So do you think that the Duma shares this, let us 
hope, possible success for Russian diplomacy? 
  [Lukin] The Duma shares all Russia's successes, including 
those made by Russian diplomacy, as long as they are successes. 
  [Svanidze] Yes, of course. Ambassador, in your opinion, 
whose success is it -- if it turns out to be a success? Was it 
achieved by Russian diplomacy, working together with the Duma, 
of course, the United Nations, or NATO? What do you think? 
  [Pickering] I have been in diplomacy long enough not to get 
involved in discussions of internal affairs in countries where I 
am accredited. But I think that there is enough credit to go 
around here. I think the most immediate step, and obviously (?a 
very important one), was produced by President Yeltsin's 
(?leadership) and various people working on the ground, and 
somehow (?we ended up with) a situation in which obviously the 
Bosnian Serbs had to consider very carefully what steps they 
took (?and they had to take account of) the work of the 
secretary general and the development of the UN position under 
the resolution. It all helped in the process of moving ahead. 
Realistically, I think we are not engaged in any fight or 
discussion about who takes credit [passage indistinct]. 
  [Svanidze] Thank you. Vladimir Petrovich, what do you think 
about frequent talk of the contradiction in Western and Russian 
interests in the Balkans? This is stated frequently. What do 
you think about it? 
  [Lukin] I think that we have a lot in common. I think that 
in the long term our victories and defeats will be the same, 
although, I agree with my friend Tom here. Listening to him, I 
remembered a French proverb saying that victory has a lot of 
father and that defeat is an orphan, but as far as long term 
prospects are concerned, what sort of interests can people, not 
wishing to see a conflict, have? They want to stop the 
conflict, to reach an agreement, finally to put an end to people 
being killed and see the observance of slight balances of 
national interests both within various communities -- who 
brought about the explosion of the whole process -- and on a 
more general scale in Europe. I am convinced that we can 
achieve this but one has to be careful. Every country has to 
look, not just in the mirror, but also in the window so that it 
can see its opponent, appreciate his arguments, and listen to 
them carefully from the very beginning. Only then will we 
achieve the settlement, we most definitely will because, of 
course, Russia wants fraternal and friendly nations -- and that 
is what they are -- to stop shooting each other. Finally, there 
is a chance, but I would like to emphasize that we are only 
talking about the possibility for settling this particular 
critical situation, however morbid it might be. After that 
there will be a very complex stage of settling the whole Bosnian 
problem. All sober thinking people, professionals and 
non-professional, will have to make a huge effort to resolve it. 
  [Svanidze] Incidentally, I did not know you were personal 
friends, Vladimir Petrovich, I was not warned about this. You 
may have agreed on this before the program began, or is that 
ruled out? 
  [Lukin] We have known each other long enough, and when Tom 
was leaving the United States we got together and had a lively 
and detailed discussion of our professional matters. We have 
met regularly since, and I have a great respect for this 
outstanding diplomat. 
  [Pickering] Thank you. 
  [Svanidze] Gentlemen, I have a question to you both. In the 
past few days, there has been a lot of talk about the health 
condition of President Yeltsin and his ability to work. More 
specifically, President Clinton failed to reach him on the 
telephone, and there have been many other rumors. Now it is 
known for sure that the message to the president of Serbia was 
signed by the Russian president who played an important role in 
-- well, at this stage let us call it an attempt to resolve the 
crisis. Let me ask you first, Vladimir Petrovich: Do you think 
that this stance of President Yeltsin will boost his rating and 
raise his prestige both in Russia and abroad? 
  [Lukin] Well, first and foremost, I would like to say that I 
saw the president with my own eyes when John Major was here on a 
visit. I participated ex officio in some of the protocol 
events, and he was then in a normal working condition. The 
other side of the question -- excuse me, what did you ask? 
  [Svanidze] The question was if Yeltsin's prestige would grow 
now because there has been a lot of talk about this recently -- 
about his ability to work. 
  [Lukin] I think the prestige of everyone involved in this 
work will grow. I agree that in Russia the president was the 
person most involved in it, together with the people who worked 
on the spot. So, all the people who did this work deserve that 
their prestige should increase and it will increase. 
  [Svanidze] And what is your opinion, Ambassador? 
  [Pickering] I heard with interest what Vladimir was saying. 
I had great pleasure in being able to take part in the summit 
in January, and I thought that President Yeltsin's state was as 
Vladimir has said. I think that the leadership of President 
Yeltsin has played a significant role, as well as that of our 
country's president, since both them became involved in joint 
work. Unfortunately, due to a number of technical reasons, they 
failed to contact each other on the telephone, but they have 
been in touch several times since, including just this morning, 
and I have had several very good messages from President Clinton 
to your president, on developments in Bosnia, among other things. 
  [Svanidze] Our time is up, thank you very much. I remind you 
that the guests of the Details tonight were Vladimir Lukin, the 
chairman of the Russian Duma Committee for International 
Affairs, and Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador extraordinary 
and plenipotentiary to Russia. Goodbye.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Commission for International Affairs, by correspondent Boris 
Kalyagin; place and date not given; from the "The Bosnian Knot" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kalyagin] Russia believes that it is impossible to 
achieve a military settlement of the Bosnian problem: a peaceful 
settlement is required. Decisions influencing the situation in 
Bosnia must be taken not by NATO, but by the UN Security 
Council. Russia must not stand on the sidelines while such 
actions are being worked out and approved. This was stressed by 
President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin in his conversations with 
Western leaders, and this stance is backed by the Russian public 
and by our parliamentarians. 
  [Lukin] We believe that in this matter the policy of the 
international community, of all countries including Russia, 
should be coordinated and based on true partnership. That does 
not mean some can take decisions and inform the others; it means 
decisions must be adopted jointly, however difficult that may 
be. That is mature partnership, based on equal rights. 
  [Kalyagin] Do you fully support the policy of our government 
in the Bosnian issue, or do you believe that there have been 
some omissions? 
  [Kalyagin] I believe that now the stance of the foreign 
ministry as it is being expressed is very close to what is 
contained in the statement. This position proceeds from the 
fact that our main task is to prevent bombing, to prevent air 
strikes, and naturally, to create conditions to stop the bombing 
of Sarajevo. That is the right aim. It is also right that our 
Foreign Ministry is demanding a special decision by the UN 
Security Council on the question of whether to implement the 
ultimatum, to implement the threat. However, the problem is 
that one mistake brings others in its wake. I am firmly 
convinced that the earlier vote approving limited air strikes 
was a mistake... 
  [Kalyagin, interrupting] To protect UN convoys. 
  [Lukin] Unfortunately it was to protect UN convoys and 
civilians, which in itself is excellent and noble. But that can 
be used any way one wants. The Duma may express its point of 
view. Its statement will be very firm. The essence -- I know 
this, knowing the mood of the Duma -- is that if the United 
States and NATO adopt unilateral decisions in spite of our 
recommendations, in spite of the very insistent opinion of a 
partner, then the partner can adopt unilateral actions and 
statements as well. This is another question: it is a matter 
for executive authority, a matter for separate consultations, 
but I would not want that. I am in favor of partnership, I am 
in favor of joint decisions.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations February 21 TASS -- On Russia's 
initiative the United Nations Security Council convened for a 
closed-door consultations late on Sunday [20 February] to 
discuss the latest developments around Sarajevo. ITAR-TASS 
learned that the Security Council meeting was called because of 
Russia's serious concern over the unclear situation with the use 
of the NATO air force against the Serbian heavy arms near 
Sarajevo, including those which could not be withdrawn on 
schedule because of bad weather. 
  "The Russian Federation raised on Sunday afternoon the 
question about the convocation of the Security Council because 
the situation looked as though all the accords on Sarajevo could 
be disrupted because the Serbs left their arms to be taken over 
by the United Nations but the United Nations failed to take 
control because of snowfalls. We were very worried, because the 
weapons left uncontrolled by the U.N. forces could be seen as a 
bait for the beginning of air strikes, which are absolutely 
unnecessary in these circumstances," Russian ambassador to the 
United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov told ITAR-TASS. 
  "This is why we convened the Security Council in order to 
draw the attention of all, including the U.N. forces, the U.N. 
secretary-general and his special envoy to the former Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi, to the need to urgently take control over these 
weapons and preclude any possibility of unjustified air strikes, 
which could disrupt not only all accords on Sarajevo but also 
possible agreements on Bosnia and herzegovina. The moment was 
very tense, and this is why we convened the council," Vorontsov 
said. 
  "At the meeting, we raised these questions and stressed that 
neither the U.N. secretary-general nor Akashi must forget that 
the "clues" to air strikes were in their hands, in the hands of 
the United Nations and its secretary-general, and that the NATO 
command may not launch air strikes on its own, when it is quite 
clear that the Serbs are abiding by the necessary conditions and 
complying with the obligations they assumed. 
  "This is why we approached the U.N. secretary-general, the 
chairman of the Security Council and the council members to urge 
them to be most attentive to reminding the secretary-general 
that he is holding the key and that Mr. Akashi is on the spot 
and must see the situation as it really is, and not to open any 
"windows of possibility" for air strikes. 
  "But when we were discussing this question, a report arrived 
from Akashi that he would not make any decisions because the 
Serbs were true to their word, that the weapons had been 
withdrawn and that he would take control over those arms that 
still remained in place quite soon. Our aim was achieved. The 
possibility of a technical error because of the snow, which 
could result in very complicated, bloody and possibly 
irreversible events, was closed," Vorontsov said. 
  Responding to an ITAR-TASS question about the reaction of 
the 
Security Council members to Russia's intervention, Vorontsov 
said, "the members of the Security Council thanked the Russian 
side for the active part it took in solving this problem, for 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's appeal to the Serb leaders and 
the attainment of the accord on the withdrawal of their arms 
from Sarajevo. They also appreciated the sending of Russian 
troops to Sarajevo. The troops are there and stationed close to 
Sarajevo, and this is seen as a good sign".

  [Text] United Nations February 21 TASS -- The Russian and 
U.S. chief delegates made joint statements to journalists after 
urgent U.N. Security Council consultations held at the 
initiative of Russia on Sunday evening. 
  U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright said that the 
United States has just received good news from Sarajevo. 
Everything looks well for the time being. The U.S. will 
continue to watch very attentively to get convinced in the next 
few days that the NATO ultimatum is being fulfilled. 
  The United States is also very satisfied, Albright 
continued, 
that Russian troops intend to participate in the U.N. Protection 
Force and believes that a role to be played by Russians will be 
very useful. 
  Russian permanent representative to the U.N. Yuliy Vorontsov 
said: "The Russian Federation called for this Security Council 
meeting because it was worried during the day that snow would 
prevent UNPROFOR from taking weapons left by Serbs under its 
control. 
  "It looked at some moment that UNPROFOR cannot find these 
weapons in snow. That was a technical problem which disturbed 
us very much. Then, we received a report from Akashi that he 
intends to take these weapons under UNPROFOR's control, and 
there is no need for air strikes at this stage. This was good 
news."

  [Text] Athens, 18 Feb -- Talks between Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who arrived here yesterday, and Klaus 
Kinkel, head of the German foreign policy department, ended in 
the early hours. The parties discussed the development of the 
situation around the Bosnian conflict in connection with the 
positive response to a personal letter from Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and 
Radovan Karadjic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, and also from the 
Bosnian Serb parliament. The point is that the sides agreed to 
withdraw their heavy guns from a 20-km zone after receiving a 
promise that Russian forces would take part in the peace-keeping 
operations in the Sarajevo vicinity. 
  During an intensive dialogue lasting nearly three hours, the 
ministers got in touch by telephone from the residence of the 
German ambassador in Athens, where the talks took place, with 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. The parties are aware of the need to 
undertake a joint initiative shortly to advance the process of a 
settlement around Sarajevo and of the Bosnian conflict as a 
whole. 
  In addition to this, the ministers had an in-depth 
discussion 
of the state of Russian-German relations in connection with 
President Boris Yeltsin's forthcoming visit to Germany, 
scheduled for late spring. K. Kinkel invited A. Kozyrev to 
visit Germany in order to prepare for the visit, and the Russian 
foreign minister will go there at the beginning of May. 
  Today sees the start of A. Kozyrev's consultations with the 
European "troika" -- the former, present, and future presidents 
of the Council of the European Union; that is, the foreign 
ministers of Belgium, Greece, and Germany -- and also, in all 
probability, telephone consultations with British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd and Warren Christopher.

  [Text] Athens, 18 Feb -- The foreign ministers of Russia 
and the FRG discussed in Athens German assistance to the 
development of the northern regions of the Russian Federation. 
Galina Sidorova, political adviser to the Russian foreign 
minister, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that one of the 
subjects discussed by A. Kozyrev and K. Kinkel was German 
assistance in the development of contacts with Russia's northern 
regions, in the first place with Murmansk. Germany, as the 
future chairman of the Council of the Economic Community, 
intends to hold a meeting there of the three (the former, the 
current, and the future chairmen of the Council of the European 
Community), to see on the spot what can be done for establishing 
cooperation with Murmansk Oblast. 
  Germany intends to participate most vigorously in the 
development of this oblast and at the meeting of the ministers 
some specific decisions in this area were discussed. In 
particular K. Kinkel intends to propose a German town as a 
"twin-town" for Murmansk. 
  Germany is ahead of many other countries in terms of 
fleshing 
out its political partnership with Russia. If effective 
cooperation is established with Murmansk, this could serve as a 
positive example for other regions of Russia, the minister's 
political adviser pointed out. 
  A. Kozyrev and K. Kinkel also discussed the situation in the 
Baltic region and Russia's attitude to the Baltic states.

  [Text] Athens, 18 Feb -- Russia will take part in 
peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo and in Bosnia as a whole, and 
will take the necessary steps, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev stated here today at his news conference. The news 
conference took place after his political consultations with 
three EC foreign ministers -- those of Belgium, Greece, and 
Germany. 
  Kozyrev said that at the moment UN representatives are 
discussing the number of personnel in such formations. There is 
hope that this problem will be solved within the next few hours 
and Russian "blue helmets" will take part in the peacekeeping 
operations in Sarajevo. The main thing is not to miss the this 
opportunity but to move toward the peace settlement. 
  He said that Russia has historical, cultural, and religious 
sympathy with all the peoples of southern Europe and is 
interested in stability in the Balkans. It is in Russia's 
interests that all the states in this region should enjoy their 
sovereignty and independence and renounce all territorial or any 
other claims on each other by solving all the problems by 
political means. In particular, we are always ready to offer 
our help as mediators in solving controversial problems between 
Athens and Skopje, both of which we consider as friendly states, 
he said. 
  During all the stages involved in reaching a Bosnian 
settlement, the Russian minister said, we have been taking part 
in the efforts that are being made to resolve the conflict 
politically, both in Sarajevo and in Bosnia as a whole. These 
efforts have been manifested in the new Russian initiative to 
set up security zones, primarily around Sarajevo. They have 
found expression in the letter that Russian Federation President 
Boris Yeltsin sent to the Serbs, and to which their positive 
reply has been received. 
  A. Kozyrev commended the efforts by Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias, who has launched a personal initiative for 
moving toward peace in the region. 
  Reiterating the importance of B. Yeltsin's message, the 
minister said that Russia is now trying to get the United States 
and other partners to exert the necessary influence on all sides 
in the conflict, especially the Muslims and Croatians, so that 
they opt not for force but for using the opportunities opening 
up for achieving peace in Sarajevo and in Bosnia as a whole. 
The laurels for whoever does the most for this will be shared 
later, if this is necessary at all, A. Kozyrev concluded. The 
main thing is not to miss this new opportunity for peace in 
Europe.

  [Text] In Athens Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, 
has suggested that an international conference on Bosnia be held 
some time next week. He said the call was for a conference on 
Bosnia and it came from President Boris Yeltsin. The United 
States, German, British, French, and Greek Governments had 
already been notified. Kozyrev made the statement after he met 
with his Greek, Belgian, and German counterparts in Athens. 
Speaking with newsmen in the Greek capital, he stated Yeltsin's 
call for the Serbs to remove their heavy weapons and the Serbs' 
willingness to meet this call created favorable conditions for a 
peace settlement. The minister said Russian peacekeepers were 
ready to be deployed in Sarajevo and other areas of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. A spokesman for the United Nations has told 
the French news agency 400 troops of the Russian battalion based 
in eastern Croatia have started moving toward Sarajevo.

  [Text] Athens February 18 TASS -- The Athens meeting of the 
current and future chairmen of the European Union's council 
focused on all aspects of the Bosnian settlement, said Galina 
Sidorova, political adviser of Russian Foreign minister Andrey 
Kozyrev who also participated in the Athens consultations. 
  The meeting participants praised the message of Boris 
Yeltsin 
to the Serbs on the need for joint actions of the United States, 
the European Union and other partners in order to boost the 
Bosnian settlement. A meeting of senior officials from the 
Russian Federation, the United States, Germany, France and Great 
Britain, as well as the European Council's "three" will be held 
next week to discuss a dialogue with the Security Council, the 
United Nations and the co-chairmen of the London conference on 
former Yugoslavia. 
  According to diplomatic circles, the meeting will be held in 
Bonn. There may also be a meeting of foreign ministers on the 
same issue. 
  The process was initiated by German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel and Andrey Kozyrev, said Sidorova. After meetings with 
U.S. state secretary and foreign ministers of France and Great 
Britain, everyone supported the need for joint initiatives. 
  The Athens consultations also discussed the soonest signing 
of a treaty on cooperation and partnership by the European Union 
and Russia. The political declaration was signed by Boris 
Yeltsin in 1993, and the treaty will outline specific areas of 
cooperation and interaction. 
  There are some disputable questions, including exports of 
nuclear cycle materials and banking. Some voice the need for 
quotas on these goods, and the Russian side is against this. 
Russia is against any quotas on these goods. Sidorova said 
Greece is ready to help the soonest conclusion of the treaty. 
  The consultations analyzed European security, the situation 
in conflict zones on territory of the former Soviet Union, 
including Transcaucasia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and relations with 
Ukraine. 
  They noted general understanding on sanctions against former 
Yugoslavia. The question of sanctions will be raised as soon as 
settlement progresses, and this coincides with the Russian stand 
on the issue. 
  Describing the situation in Transcaucasia, Kozyrev stressed 
the interest in the involvement of CSCE and U.N. peace-makers, 
said Sidorova.

  [Text] Prague February 19 TASS -- Russia is on the best of 
terms with all the member states of the Visegrad group, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who came to Prague for a 
working visit, told ITAR-TASS. President Boris Yeltsin is 
continuously maintaining personal contacts with the leadership 
of those countries, with which Moscow has contractual relations 
and with which agreements have been signed on a top level. 
  The Visegrad group is of much interest for Russia, Kozyrev 
continued. "We have tremendous respect for those countries and 
are building relations with them on the principles of equality." 
In his opinion, speculations on some "new Brezhnev doctrines" 
and the allegedly inequitable relations between Russia and those 
countries are absolutely groundless. According to Kozyrev, the 
time has come to "check watches" with all the countries of the 
Visegrad group early this year in order "to advance jointly, in 
harmony, towards complete mutual understanding." 
  "We are going to discuss in Prague some international 
problems, primarily the situation in Bosnia, and to analyse 
matters dealing with bilateral contacts in a broader context. I 
believe we have traditionally durable relations and good 
prospects for the future," Kozyrev said. In his opinion, it is 
necessary to discuss in a frank, calm and unbiased way how we 
should build our relations in the future and develop partnership. 
  We should discuss problems of building a new greater Europe. 
There are no ready formulae for it. According to Kozyrev, the 
participation in the Partnership for Peace programme is one of 
the ways and the joining of NATO is another. All countries, 
including Czechia, are resolving this problem by themselves. We 
are interested in finding most effective, balanced solutions 
concerning ways of developing partnership. But we should not 
regard NATO as the only way. We have the Visegrad group, we 
have other CSCE institutions, he continued. In the opinion of 
the Russian foreign minister, we should not contrast all those 
ways with each other, but on the contrary, to use them all. 
  "We are not linking our actions in the settlement of the 
Bosnian conflict with the NATO ultimatum. Actually we believe 
it does not have much to do with us. What is really important 
today is that it should not be an obstacle, that the 'war 
parties,' -- the Serb, Croatian and Muslim extremists interested 
in the escalation of hostilities -- should not take advantage of 
it. 
  The most important thing is that no one should try to 
disrupt 
with the help of provocations the positive process that has been 
started thanks to the initiative of President Boris Yeltsin. 
The initiative of the Russian side was approved by the 
president three weeks ago. It is aimed, in the first place, at 
creating security zones, primarily around Sarajevo. "Now this 
initiative has been given a clear and vivid shape," Kozyrev said. 
  In his opinion, there is a possibility today to get back 
from 
unilateral steps to joint actions of the whole of the world 
community. The Russian president is maintaining direct contacts 
with leaders of many countries, especially with Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl (they had a telephone conversation on Friday). 
Contacts are also being maintained on the level of foreign 
ministers with the "European union three," the United States, 
Britain and France. Kozyrev believes that the G7 countries 
should be invited to take part in that process. 
  "The problem today is to take advantage of the 
opportunities, 
created by the initiative of the Russian president and a 
positive response to it of the Serb side, and not to allow 
various provocations to disrupt the process. We should 
strengthen it with the help of far-reaching agreements both on 
Sarajevo and on Bosnia in general," Kozyrev stressed.

  [Text] Prague February 19 TASS -- The dispute over NATO 
expansion has lost actuality after the adoption of the 
"Partnership for Peace" programme, according to Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  "We believe that the dispute has lost actuality at all. Now 
the 'Partnership for Peace' plan has been adopted and we believe 
that its implementation will give us a lot of work at least for 
the foreseeable future", he told a press conference on Saturday 
after meeting Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic Josef 
Zieleniec. 
  Both Russia and the Czech Republic have to implement the 
plan 
first and then think what to do next, according to Kozyrev. 
  "We believe that NATO is an organisation with which it is 
necessary to cooperate. But NATO is only one of such 
organisations. There are also the European Union, the CIS, the 
Visegrad group. That is why we are discussing how to use all 
these organisations, how to meet the challenges which none of 
them, including NATO and the CSCE, are ready to meet so far", 
Kozyrev said. 
  The Russian minister admitted that certain differences in 
the 
positions of the two sides do exist, but they are caused "not by 
a head-on collision of interests, but rather by the complexity 
of problems which are to be jointly solved." 
  "It was in this spirit that the issues of ensuring European 
security, including the crises in Bosnia and other hot spots, 
were discussed", Kozyrev said. 
  Zieleniec stressed that Russia had met with understanding 
the 
position of the Czech Republic about its integration into 
European structures. 
  He added that remaining bilateral problems, including 
financial issues, would be soon solved and that it is necessary 
to accelerate the preparations of a visit of the prime minister 
of the Czech Republic to Moscow.

  [Text] Prague, 20 Feb -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev believes that the views of the Russian and Czech sides 
coincide: Both believe that the efforts of the world community 
should now be concentrated on consolidating the positive 
elements that have emerged in the settlement of the crisis in 
Bosnia, especially after the message from Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin. Kozyrev said this at a news conference for Czech 
and foreign journalists at the end of his talks with Czech Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus. 
  In addition to current international problems, questions 
pertaining to the further development of bilateral relations 
were also discussed at the talks.

  [Text] Premier Vaclav Klaus and Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev had a brief meeting with journalists after their 
two-hour long talks. Czech radio correspondent David Stahlavsky 
reports: 
  [Stahlavsky] Journalists' questions naturally concerned the 
situation in Bosnia and the ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs due to 
expire at midnight today. Kozyrev explained the visit of the 
special Russian envoy to Sarajevo by saying that, according to 
the agreement with Bosnian Serbs, 400 Russian soldiers will be 
transferred from Croatia to the Bosnian capital. Asked whether 
the envoy will stay there even after the ultimatum expires, 
Kozyrev said that Russia does not recognize this ultimatum.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 20 (TANJUG) -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev Sunday rejected the possibility that NATO should 
realize its threat to launch air strikes if Bosnian Serbs do not 
withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo. 
  `We disregard the deadline. We do not take the deadline (set 
by NATO) into account', Kozyrev told the press after a meeting 
with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. 
  After accepting the Russian initiative for the deployment of 
Russian peacekeepers between Moslem and Serb forces, Bosnian 
Serbs Friday started withdrawing their heavy artillery from 
around Sarajevo. The operation is being hindered by snow and 
bad weather. 
  Meeting Kozyrev Friday, Czech Foreign Minister Jozef 
Zieleniec said it was important that Russian forces jointed NATO 
lately in establishing peace in Sarajevo [sentence as received]. 
  Kozyrev however underlined that Russian forces in Sarajevo 
can act only under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command, 
adding that the peace conference would be resumed in a few days. 
  Kozyrev Sunday ended a two-day visit to the Czech Republic.

  [Text] Prague February 21 TASS -- As concerns speculations 
about "Russia's sphere of interests in Eastern Europe", Russia 
does not imply anything else but its desire to develop 
comprehensive cooperation with the countries of this region," 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in winding up the 
first leg of his East European tour in Prague. 
  He said the Visegrad group of countries was of special 
interest to Russia because it has long been linked to them by 
traditional political, economic, cultural and religious ties. 
  During his visit to Prague, the Russian minister was 
received 
by Czech President Vaclav Havel and held talks with Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus and his Czech counterpart Josef Zelenc. 
  President Havel said the talks were "very intensive" and 
touched upon European security and the roles of NATO and the 
Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe in the 
European security process. Naturally, the Bosnian conflict was 
one of the main items on the agenda of the talks. Havel said 
that the Czech Republic was backing the NATO ultimatum but 
believed that preliminary consultations with Russia were 
necessary. 
  According to Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus the two countries 
expressed "very similar views" on all the problems under 
discussion. This applied to bilateral relations and to 
international issues, including the situation in Europe. 
  Speaking about the Czech Republic's attitude to NATO, Klaus 
said that "Prague was striving to become a "standard" European 
state and consequently a member of Europe's standard structures, 
including NATO and the European Union". In this respect the 
Czech Republic's membership of NATO would not mean that it seeks 
"to protect itself from Russia". It is intended to ensure 
national security and is not targeted against any other country. 
  The Russian minister told the Czech president that the aim 
of 
his visit to the Czech Republic, in accordance with President 
Boris Yeltsin's wish, was "to try and understand how our 
neighbours and our friends are feeling". He said that the 
desire to continue political dialogue on wide range of problems 
of European security and bilateral relations, confirmed by the 
sides during his visit to Prague, was an important result of 
talks in the Czech Republic. He stressed that there are 
extensive possibilities for the development of traditional 
cultural and religious ties between Moscow and Prague. 
  Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, the Russian 
minister 
said he was leaving Prague with an understanding that two 
schools are now acting in the Czech Republic -- one of President 
Vaclav Havel and the other of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The 
first one teaches how to combat totalitarianism in any form and 
how to struggle for democracy and human rights. The second 
school teaches radical economic reforms. 
  The development of religious and spiritual ties between the 
two countries was considered at a meeting between archbishop 
Milo Vilka of Prague and Archimadrite Feofan, who arrived in the 
Czech capital as a member of the Russian delegation. 
  The Russian foreign minister will continue his East European 
tour today. He is due to fly to Budapest.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Zhirnikhin] </F>
  [Text] Budapest, 18 Feb -- Since the replacement of 
totalitarian regimes, and Hungary and Russia embarking on the 
democratic path of development, the relations between the two 
countries have entered a qualitatively new stage. Hungarian 
Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky stated this today to the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent on the occasion of the upcoming official 
visit to Budapest by Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev. 
  Naturally, many spoke of equality in the Hungarian-Soviet 
friendship during the "Communist period" though in reality 
Hungary was in a clearly subordinate position, the minister 
said. The USSR constantly interfered in the internal affairs of 
our country. Nevertheless, the Hungarian people never identified 
the Soviet policies that in many cases violated the national 
interests of Hungary, with the stance of the Russian people. 
Many in our country understood and continue to understand that 
it was the peoples of Russia who were, in the first place, the 
victims of Stalinism and the communist model, G. Jeszenszky 
pointed out. 
  In this connection, he said, suffice it to recall the events 
of 1956 in Hungary, when most of the Soviet soldiers and 
officers in the country understood the true nature of the 
popular uprising. This is why, at the decisive phase of 
suppressing the revolution, they were replaced by a "fresh" 
contingent of troops from another part of the USSR. Some 
soldiers and officers took the side of the uprising against the 
Communist dictatorship of the Hungarian people. One can only 
speculate how many were subsequently executed for failure to 
obey orders. 
  G. Jeszenszky expressed hope that the new Russian Federal 
Assembly, unlike its predecessor, would ratify the treaty 
between the two countries with the paragraph condemning the 
Soviet intervention in the 1956 events in Hungary. 
  The minister thought it necessary to recall that beginning 
with August 1991 in the Soviet Union, the Republic of Hungary 
has consistently been one of the first to voice support for the 
democratic forces in Russia and their leader, Boris Yeltsin. In 
recent years, he stressed, our states have established good and 
constructive political relations that are free of any 
ideological element. President Yeltsin's official visit to 
Hungary was a timely high point to these relations, and the 
documents signed in Budapest provided a boost to development of 
bilateral economic ties. 
  The question of the ex-USSR's debt of $2 billion to Hungary 
was also resolved. Under an agreement reached, Russia inherited 
the debt and has already delivered various military hardware to 
half that sum. Intensive negotiations are now underway 
regarding the remainder. 
  The upcoming talks with A. Kozyrev will focus on Hungary's 
relations with NATO and East European countries' involvement in 
the Partnership for Peace program, G. Jeszenszky said. He said 
he was firmly convinced that a close relationship between East 
and Central European countries and NATO, and their subsequent 
joining of that military-political bloc, would in no way run 
counter to Russia's national interests. Hungary realizes, he 
said, that a certain part of the Russian public has 
preconceptions about NATO. The old stereotype has been too hard 
to kill off and many people in the Russian Federation still see 
the alliance above all as an enemy. But it is obvious to all who 
are familiar with the history of the North Atlantic alliance 
that it has always had a purely defensive nature and has never 
threatened anybody, Russia included. The minister thought that 
Russia should be interested in calm and stability in the region 
that abuts its western borders. In turn, NATO's very existence 
has a beneficial influence on political stability in central 
Europe, and this is precisely why Moscow should not be anxious 
about NATO expanding in the region at Russia's expense. 
  The "South Slav crisis" will occupy an important place in 
the 
upcoming Russian-Hungarian talks. In this connection, the 
minister pointed out that at all international bodies Hungary 
has always advocated an active role for Russia in resolving the 
Balkans conflict. The events of the past few days provide solid 
grounds for hope that the Russian leadership's constructive 
initiative to solve the Bosnian crisis will be successful, and 
that NATO air strikes will not be required. This became 
possible primarily because of Russia's even-handed policy, which 
took into account the problems and concerns of the Bosnian 
Serbs, and also of the Croats and Moslems living there. 
  G. Jeszenszky said in conclusion that in any event Hungary 
will not play any role in NATO military action in Bosnia if it 
goes ahead. The main reason for this, the minister said, is 
that a significant Hungarian minority lives in Vojvodina 
(Serbia). Concern for the interests of ethnic Hungarians and 
the fact that the Hungarian and Serbian peoples are neighbors 
means that we must stand aside from "any use of force in 
Bosnia," the foreign affairs minister said.

  [Text] Budapest, 21 Feb -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev is to begin a working visit to Hungary today [21 
February]. He will visit Budapest during his tour of the 
countries of the Visegrad group which include Hungary, Poland, 
and the Czech and Slovak Republics. 
  The head of the Russian foreign policy department will hold 
talks with his Hungarian counterpart, Geza Jeszenszky, and will 
meet Hungarian President Arpad Goencz and Prime Minister Peter 
Boross. 
  In the opinion of the Hungarian side, apart from the 
development of bilateral ties, the talks will discuss, above 
all, relations between Hungary and NATO, the participation of 
the countries of Eastern Europe in the Partnership for Peace 
program, and ways of resolving the Bosnian crisis.

<F P=106> [Report from Budapest -- from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] After intensive negotiations in Prague, Andrey 
Kozyrev arrived in the Hungarian capital today. During the 
meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky, the 
parties talked not only about bilateral relations, but also 
about the Yugoslav crisis. Despite a wish to please NATO, so 
desirable to the countries of the Visegrad Four, Hungary is not 
inclined to support the bombing of Serb artillery. Serbs and 
Croats are its closest neighbors. Any escalation of the 
conflict will result in thousands of refugees and the 
instability on the border. Meanwhile the economic blockade of 
the former Yugoslavia has already cost Hungary $1.0003 billion. 
The Hungarian position is therefore close to the Russian one, 
and this was reaffirmed by the two ministers. 
  However, their approach to the expansion of NATO remains 
different. The Partnership for Peace is seen in Budapest as a 
first step toward NATO membership. However, Hungarians realize 
that they would need enormous financial means, as well as time, 
in order to join NATO. 
  Tomorrow Andrey Kozyrev will continue his talks with 
Hungarian leaders.

  [Text] As Interfax learned from the Foreign Ministry in 
Moscow, the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, who 
already visited Athens and Prague in the framework of his 
European tour, has decided to postpone his trip to Bratislava. 
"This decision was made in answer to Slovakia's request," a 
senior member of Russia's Foreign Ministry told Interfax. 
  The coalition government of Vladimir Meciar "is going 
through 
a crisis", he explained. "Evidently this is not the best time 
for a visit," he added. 
  According to the diplomat, initially the capital of Slovakia 
was to be the first point of Kozyrev's European tour. However, 
because of the aggravation of tensions in and around 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Russia's foreign minister began his tour 
with Athens, to confer with the European Union's "group of 
three": the foreign ministers of Greece, Belgium and Germany -- 
the European Union's current, previous and subsequent chairmen. 
  As Interfax's interviewee noted, from Athens Kozyrev went to 
Prague, and, on Monday morning, to Budapest. The head of 
Russian diplomacy is expected to spend two days (Monday and 
Tuesday) in the Hungarian capital. The next point of his tour 
will be Krakow, where Kozyrev and his Polish counterpart, 
Andrzej Olchowski, will attend a conference on the 
Russian-Polish relationship on the road to a new partnership. 
  Kozyrev is expected to return to Moscow on Wednesday. 
  "However Kozyrev may make some changes in the program of his 
tour. It's quite possible that he will suspend it in order to 
visit Bonn, where consultations on the ways to reach a 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be held on Tuesday," the 
diplomat said. 
  The foreign minister's secretariat confirmed that Kozyrev 
had 
postponed his trip to Bratislava. "As for Bonn, his deputy, 
Vitaly Churkin, who was in Sarajevo, went there on Monday. So 
far Kozyrev is not expected to pay a blitzvisit to Bonn," a 
member of his secretariat said.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Klaus Naumann, inspector general of </F>
the Bundeswehr, by Mikhail Zheglov; place and date not given: 
"In Future Russian and German Peacemakers Could Work Together, 
Bundeswehr Inspector General Believes"] 
  [Text] General Klaus Naumann, inspector general of the 
Bundeswehr, is on an official visit to our country. On 
completing his talks with Russia's military leadership he gave 
an exclusive interview to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. 
  [Zheglov] Herr General, on the eve of your visit it was 
announced that, in addition to military-political questions, you 
intended to discuss purely military issues in Moscow. What 
specifically did that mean? 
  [Naumann] I discussed the main areas of Russian-German 
cooperation for the current year with Colonel General Mikhail 
Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff. Basically this plan 
envisages organizing 20 bilateral events. By these I 
principally mean visits, meetings between servicemen from the 
two armies, and familiarization with the system of training in 
military-training institutions. The program also envisages an 
exchange of opinions on the issue of military budgets. All 
these measures, in our view, should help people in uniform to 
find out as much as possible about each other. 
  [Zheglov] You are the first Bundeswehr representative to 
visit our 27th Motorized Infantry Division. Why are you 
interested in this combined unit? 
  [Naumann] The host side is not only giving me the 
opportunity to familiarize myself with Russia's Ground Forces 
but also to visit Missile Forces, Air Force, and Air Defense 
Forces units. My visit to a Strategic Missile Forces 
installation, for example, has been interesting because during 
this era of openness I am getting the opportunity to look at 
things which for years were carefully concealed. My being 
allowed to look at missiles is proof of how much trust has grown 
up between us. However, the same can be said for my visits to 
the Moscow Air Defense District and the Kubinka Air Base. With 
regard to the 27th Motorized Infantry Division, I am glad of the 
opportunity to visit this combined unit which is actively 
preparing to participate in peacekeeping operations under UN 
auspices. It is also interesting because in the course of time 
joint actions by Russian and German servicemen in these sorts of 
operations are not being ruled out. Nor is it an accident that 
during my talk with the chief of the Russian General Staff I 
spoke about the need to further strengthen cooperation between 
states and armed forces engaged in peacekeeping activity. 
  [Zheglov] How do you assess the current situation in former 
Yugoslavia, where the largest UN peacekeeping operation in 
history is being conducted? 
  [Naumann] Recent events in this region have tested the 
effectiveness of Europe's security institutions to keep the 
peace. We must call a halt to this situation. In my opinion 
both Russia and Germany are keen to do this. It is time to put 
a stop to a situation in which the Paris Charter is essentially 
being flouted in Europe. Specifically, we must stop 
unilaterally laying the blame on one of the parties in the 
conflict. We must also make every effort to stop the crazy 
destruction of the innocent civilian population. This is the 
end toward which all NATO's actions are directed. I hope that 
all the parties to the conflict realize this and will put their 
heavy weapons under UN control or withdraw to a distance of 20 
km from Sarajevo. 
  [Zheglov] If a decision is eventually made to bomb Bosnian 
Serb positions, will FRG Air Force planes take part in the air 
operations? 
  [Naumann] Chancellor Kohl has made a firm and unequivocal 
statement on this matter: Not a single German serviceman will 
take part in this sort of operation. 
  [Zheglov] Events in former Yugoslavia are influencing the 
processes of establishing and strengthening common European 
security systems. What role can and should Russia and Germany 
play in this process? 
  [Naumann] In my opinion, Russia and Germany play a important 
if not decisive role in the process of establishing a European 
security system. Russia is the largest country in Europe, it 
also has significant interests in Asia. With its population of 
80 million Germany is certainly not puny in the economic sense, 
and it thereby makes its contribution to European stability. In 
this sense both our countries should strive to cooperate. Of 
course our approaches to various problems may not coincide. But 
in any case we need to look for ways ahead that lead not to new 
lines of confrontation but to mutual trust. For example, as far 
as I can understand following my talks with your defense 
minister, Russia regards the "Partnership for Peace" program 
somewhat differently from the East European countries. But in 
any case we are approaching the day when there will be no 
confrontation in Europe. 
  As a phrase, European security is indivisible sounds 
wonderful. However, the current state of affairs is such that 
people in Sarajevo, for example, regard it as empty talk. 
Unfortunately, therefore, it is a wish rather than a reality.

  [Text] St. Petersburg February 18 TASS -- Bundeswehr 
General Klaus Naumann wound up his visit to Russia by meeting 
this country's military leaders and seeing sights in St. 
Petersburg, Russia's second city. 
  During his talks with the Leningrad Military District 
commander, Colonel-General Sergey Seleznev, the two generals 
agreed that considerable progress has been made in military 
political relations between Germany and Russia, including new, 
mutual beneficial forms of partnership. Germany is, for 
example, assisting the North- Western Military District in 
building housing for Russian troops withdrawn from Germany. 
  The Russian general spoke about his country's participation 
in the Partnership for Peace program, and stressed that 
cooperation between the two countries was of vital importance 
for stabilisation in Europe as a whole. 
  Both generals agreed that it was necessary to look for a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict in Bosnia. 
  The Bundeswehr general visited the city's historical and 
cultural landmarks, including museums and theatres, and the 
Piskarevskoye memorial cemetery where he put wreaths and flowers 
at the tombs of the victims of the Nazi blockade of Leningrad. 
  Klaus Naumann will be leaving for Bonn later today.

<F P=106> [Article by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Russian </F>
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "Russia's Greatness Will Not 
Be Determined by the Number of Troops It Has"] 
  [Text] At the time of the Cold War, the 
ideological-military confrontation between East and West was 
mirrored in the extensive economic isolation of the Warsaw Pact 
states. The FRG, for example, was traditionally the Soviet 
Union's largest Western trading partner, but in 1989 trade with 
the Soviet Union accounted for only 1.5 percent of total West 
German foreign trade, that is, less than trade with Denmark. 
The Soviet model of the past was autarky motivated by military 
considerations, and that was the case even at a time when war 
between the two nuclear alliances was impossible and it was 
clear that the future belonged to whoever led in the civilian 
technology field. 
  Now that the Cold War is over, we have a chance to achieve 
lasting peace. In Western Europe, economic integration has led 
to stability and enduring peace. Economic cooperation and the 
growth in prosperity resulting from it are significant elements 
in a new security structure for all of Europe. We want to 
achieve a state of affairs in which security is primarily 
guaranteed by extensive ties, cooperation, and trust, not by 
military capability. 
  Open markets promote an international climate of confidence 
and fair dealings with each other. They encourage the exchange 
of ideas and bring peoples close to one another. Free trade 
relations promote peace. 
  What now has to be produced is a "Strategy for Partnership" 
for the democratic states of the East and West. The basic idea 
underlying such a strategy is that in a rapidly changing 
international environment, mutual interests have to be taken 
into account and that there should be a long-term strategic 
vision rather than short-term responses to individual events. 
One of the most important elements of such a strategy would 
undoubtedly be support for the reforms in Russia and the Eastern 
European states. 
  A democratic, stable, economically healthy, open, and 
predictable Russia accords with the interests of the entire 
world. It must be clear to everyone that the world does not 
need a weak, strife-torn Russia, but needs a Russia that is a 
strong partner, one that will make an indispensable contribution 
to the creation of global peace structures and will assume a 
lasting place in the family of free, law-governed, and 
democratic states. That is the most effective way of putting a 
stop to aggressive nationalism. 
  Everything possible must be done to give Russia and the 
reform states of Eastern Europe access to world markets. 
However, this is only possible to the extent that conditions 
for free enterprise are created in Russia. The decades of 
squandering Russia's natural wealth by providing artificially 
cheap energy at the expense of the population is an example of 
how violations of free market laws harm the people. Thus, 
market-oriented reform in Russia is not only a condition for 
full participation in the global marketplace, but also a 
condition for the economically sensible and thrifty use of 
Russia's own domestic strengths. That in turn is a condition 
for Russia's economic success. Russia will only become 
democratically stable if it is economically successful, and it 
can only become a lasting partner for stability in Europe and 
the rest of the world if it is democratically stable. 
  Russia has had a democratic constitution since 12 December 
1993. The Russian parliament enjoys democratic legitimacy. 
Thus, Russia has moved much closer to membership of the 
European Council. At the same time, the foundations of the 
framework for a law-governed state, which is necessary for the 
functioning of social market economy, have been created. The 
free market economy needs an active start that can protect its 
function with regard to competition and laws. A law-governed 
state and certainty about legal conditions is a basic condition 
for political and economic freedom. 
  After World War II, West Germany had an opportunity to 
rebuild the country, which had been ruined, with a social market 
economy. A social market economy means combining the freedom of 
the market with the dictates of social justice. At first, West 
Germany also experienced a wave of inflation and unemployment 
while the war economy, with its excessive emphasis on armaments 
and heavy industry, was converted to meet the demands of the 
population of a country living in peace. Once this conversion 
crisis had been overcome, however, the social market economy 
came to mean increasing prosperity for all. 
  The situation in Russia today is in some respects different 
from that in West Germany 45 years ago. However, the mechanisms 
of free market development, which were effective then, are no 
less effective today. Whoever disregards them pays the price in 
the form of stagnation and decline. 
  Russia possesses immeasurable reserves of mineral resources. 
However, its greatest wealth lies in its inhabitants, in their 
professional qualifications, their spiritual strength, and 
tenacity. Russia possesses first-rate educational reserves. In 
the research and development field, there are many technologies 
in which it is a world leader. This valuable potential must be 
retained and developed. 
  The transition from centralized command and administrative 
structures as well as state monopolies to a decentralized free 
market economy based on competition is a unique historical 
process for which there are no models. The right course will be 
a tightrope walk between extremes. A shock without therapy is 
no less dangerous than a therapy that only tries to treat 
symptoms without addressing the roots of the illness. A 
difficult political balance between the exigency of effecting a 
transition and the vital necessity of maintaining social 
stability will continually have to be struck. Adjustments will 
be inevitable. There is no ideal way leading to the future. 
However, there is even less of a way back. 
  Without the reformist beginnings of the past few years, the 
current situation in Russia would be all the more difficult. The 
latest economic data provide grounds for hope: Russia's 
position in foreign trade is beginning to improve, the 
privatization program is making impressive progress, production 
is gradually responding to signals from consumers. Russia is 
demonstrating that it possesses the capacity for self-renewal, a 
capacity that has enabled Russia to survive times of crisis so 
often in its history. 
  Russia cannot simply copy Western models and theories. 
Russia will modernize, but it will not give up its deep-rooted 
culture and wealth of tradition. In the same way as the 
requirements in Russia are unique, reform processes must also 
take account of the elements unique to Russia's situation. The 
free market economy in Germany is, for example, different from 
that Japan, although the fundamental principles are the same. 
  With active German support, Russia has made considerable 
progress on the way to global economic partnership: It is an 
equal member in international financial institutions and a 
partner in dialogue with the G-7. Germany will promote the 
development of this dialogue. Germany supports Russia in 
developing closer ties with the OECD. The Coordinating Committee 
for Multilateral Export Controls will be disbanded. Instead, 
Russia will become an equal partner in a new forum that is to 
collect comprehensive information on exports of military 
technology worldwide. Extensive progress has been made in 
negotiations between the EU and Russia on comprehensive 
agreement on cooperation and partnership. So far, Germany has 
provided Russia with assistance totaling almost 90 billion 
German marks. It thus accounts for over 50 percent of worldwide 
support for Russia's reforms. This unequivocally reflects 
Germany's firm commitment to engage in partnership with a 
democratic Russia. 
  The unilateral transfer of assistance is not, however, a 
permanent state of affairs. It can only assist the growth of 
solid, mutually advantageous trade relations, but cannot be a 
substitute for Russian efforts to achieve a transformation. 
Until now, Russia has primarily exported raw materials. It 
must now enter world markets with technologically advanced 
products. That assumes that military production will undergo 
conversion with the aim of boosting civilian prosperity. 
  In the future, Russia's greatness will not be measured in 
terms of the number of soldiers or weapons it has, or the size 
of its territory. Russia's global role will become all the more 
important if it succeeds in developing a future-oriented, 
democratic model of society, bolstering CSCE principles, 
contributing to an increase in prosperity -- in Russia and 
worldwide -- and participating constructively in mankind's great 
future tasks. Not military capacity for destruction, but 
economic and technical capacity, and positive development will 
determine states' status and influence. Russian intellectual and 
cultural life must once again assume its appropriate place in 
cultural dialogue. 
  Change begins in the mind. If one analyzes the economic 
successes of the countries of Southeast Asia, one notes that a 
large number of highly gifted students studied abroad for a time 
and brought back new ideas and impulses. The same path is also 
open to the former communist reformist states. For almost three 
generations, there were virtually insurmountable barriers 
between the intellectual life of Russia and that of the rest of 
the world. Now, there has to be a lot of catching up in this 
respect. Exchanges for students and academic staff must be 
expanded. That is the only way in which understanding between 
peoples can grow and knowledge and experience can be used for 
the good of all transcending all borders. 
  It is also important that Russians themselves see the 
results 
of cooperation with other countries with their own eyes. With 
that in mind, models for this kind of cooperation must be 
created in the individual regions of Russia. The Murmansk 
region, which one of the authors of this article represents in 
the Russian Parliament as a democratically elected deputy, can 
serve as an example in this respect. This Russian region, which 
was previously hermetically sealed off, is now being extensively 
opened up for direct contacts and cooperation with neighboring 
states and other countries. To provide active support for this 
process by promoting specific economic and investment projects 
means demonstrating that our partnership is reality. 
  After World War II, Germany achieved a peaceful 
reconciliation with its neighbors by way of democracy and the 
free market economy. This not only facilitated the unification 
of Germany, but also opened up opportunities for the economic 
and cultural blossoming of the whole country. Today, Russia has 
the same opportunities. The transition is difficult and will 
require time. The Russians themselves know that best of all. 
However, through that transition, Russia can finally develop 
its potential and find its role in the international community.

  [Text] On 17 February Baku Radio and later other mass media 
disseminated a statement by the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry 
that accused the Armenian leadership of trying to talk to 
Azerbaijan from a position of strength and for continuing the 
occupation of Azerbaijani territories. This propagandistic 
argument was based on the fact that the Armenian Foreign 
Ministry has rejected to participate in a scheduled meeting of 
Armenian and Azerbaijani experts in the Norwegian capital of 
Oslo. 
  As is known, the international non-governmental public 
organization International Alert is sponsoring this meeting. 
  The Armenian Foreign Ministry press and public relations 
service is authorized to state the following: The Armenian 
authorities are convinced that any mediation mission aimed at 
settling the Karabakh conflict can be productive only if the 
plenipotentiary representatives of the legally elected 
authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are included in the 
negotiating processes. 
  Attempts to resolve the Karabakh problem through talks 
between the representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan show that, 
despite the developments over recent years, certain 
international circles have failed to grasp the essence of the 
problem. 
  Despite periodically disseminated disinformation, the 
Armenian authorities have defended and continue to defend all 
peacemaking efforts for the establishment of peace in the 
region, including those of the CSCE and Russia. This is 
revealed by the existing initiatives, the constructive stance 
shown, and positive responses by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Armenia is convinced that there is no alternative to a 
peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict. All strong-arm 
methods to resolve the conflict are doomed to fail.

  [Text] Yerevan February 21 TASS -- Georgian Prime Minister 
Otar Patsatsia left for home today after he failed during a 
one-day visit to reach an agreement with Armenian leaders on 
disputed economic matters, a source in the Armenian Government 
told ITAR-TASS on Monday. 
  Patsatsia was received by Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan and Premier Grant Bagratyan behind closed doors. 
Although the contents of the talks were not made public, they 
apparently dealt with the problems of transporting Armenia-bound 
goods via Georgian territory. 
  Patsatia refused to sign an agreement proposed by Yerevan 
according to which Georgia should bear more responsibility in 
case natural gas supplies were cut off or limited, the source 
said. 
  Armenia receives natural gas through a pipeline passing 
across Georgia which has several times been exploded. 
  Also disturbing for Armenia is that cargo trains with wheat 
and other goods destined for Armenia come from Georgia with 
delay or are plundered while passing through its territory.

  [Text] Kiev, 21 Feb -- Members of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine Presidium discussed the working agenda of the Supreme 
Council session on 22-26 February. The issues of an 
all-Ukrainian referendum, Ukraine's membership in the CIS 
countries' economic union, and the accession of Ukraine to the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] were not included in the 
agenda. 
  Participants in the presidium sitting focused their 
attention 
mainly on debating the issue of the correspondence of the 
Republic of Crimea's legislative acts with the Constitution of 
Ukraine. Vasyl Kozarenko, people's deputy of Ukraine, said this 
issue virtually could not be settled now because of the lack of 
time and absence of a mechanism whereby Crimea's legislative 
acts could be brought in line with the Constitution of Ukraine. 
Legal acts of both the president and Ukraine's and Crimea's 
parliaments must be assessed, in Vasyl Kozarenko's opinion, by a 
constitutional court, which at present is nonexistent. 
  The Supreme Council Presidium members included around 50 
issues in next week's plenary agenda. The issue of introducing 
changes and amendments to some of Ukraine's legislative acts on 
privatization questions will primarily be tackled. Deputies are 
planning to address the question of mandatory social insurance 
contributions for 1994. 
  On 23 February, deputies are planning to discuss the Law on 
the Protection of Information in Automatic Systems in its second 
reading and elect a National Television Council [Natsionalna 
Rada po Telebachennyu]. The issue of resolving the payments 
crisis will also be examined. 
  On Thursday, 24 February, the Supreme Council will examine 
the Law on Corruption in its second reading. Deputies are 
planning to introduce changes and amendments to the Law on the 
Elections of the President of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist 
Republic. The law was adopted in May 1991 and is still 
unchanged.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of concluding speech by Eduard Shevardnadze, </F>
chairman of the State Council, at meeting on privatization held 
in his office in Tbilisi on 20 February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The issue of proprietors. So far, ministries 
have the richest experience in it. They have an experience in 
cooperation in its comprehensive meaning, in relations with 
other countries and cooperation within the country, within the 
republic. Therefore, as far as I know a move toward contract 
relations has been observed in many ministries, in the Ministry 
of Industries for example. 
  A certain group of people has purchased a certain enterprise 
like a shop, a production workshop or an agricultural facility. 
However, it has not broken away from the state, from the 
ministry and it begins a new sort of relations with similar 
organizations on the basis of reciprocal payment, of course. 
These relations should be beneficial for the ministries and ten 
times more beneficial for this privatized enterprise. 
  Otherwise, the majority of enterprises will not be able to 
survive competitiveness in, say, the Central Asian market, or 
the Russian market, and so on, to say nothing of the West 
European market. Each enterprise needs to be developed daily 
and annually. To be developed technically, to develop technology 
and administration and so on. An individual enterprise will 
find it very difficult. It will take a long time for an 
enterprise to establish links and relations with Europe, Asia, 
and other countries and enterprises and they will not have 
enough possibilities. Therefore, ministries may become 
indispensable as partners of enterprises like this. If our 
ministries take up a principle of partnership with such 
enterprises, they will be needed in future by the country and 
especially by these enterprises. 
  Underground privatization is an issue to be considered 
separately. I think a special group should be created within 
the Cabinet of Ministers in this respect, of course on the basis 
of your ministry and involving, in my opinion, representatives 
of the prosecutor's office, Ministry of Justice, lawyers and our 
lawmakers and some of these cases should be legalized. Who are 
the participants in this underground privatization? [passage 
omitted] 
  The principal participants in so-called underground 
privatization are those who work at the enterprise. These are 
managers, chief engineers, and others. This is a collective. I 
think that we have to change our hostile attitude toward this 
corps of managers which has an inclination to transfer 
enterprises to a new concept. Because, regardless of our 
desire, these people are the best professionals and they are 
capable of transferring a certain enterprise or a certain 
facility to a new concept relatively painlessly. Someone will 
find illegal benefits in it, someone will become rich but I 
think even a newcomer should become rich, anyway. [passage 
omitted] 
  When a plant or a factory or any other facility transfers to 
market economy, it will test its abilities itself. If they do 
not fit new requirements they will be filtered by the life. 
Natural selection will take place. [passage omitted] 
  There should apparently be a list of systems and 
organizations which are required by the state as something to 
rely on and a source of its power and which cannot be subjected 
to privatization. I cannot agree with the public view that a 
collective should not have an advantage in privatizing its 
enterprise. [passage omitted] 
  I do not want us to be enslaved by the idea that the state 
must own 51 percent of all enterprises. I do not support this 
idea. Its share may be 60 percent, or 10 percent. To establish 
obligatory share for every enterprise and facility means to 
create obstacles along the way we want to take. [passage omitted] 
  In order to secure the basis for normal development of 
privatization we need rather a labor-consuming process of taking 
inventory on all our property, everything possessed by us, I 
mean the state. When we know what is in our possession we will 
be able to act with more courage. [passage omitted] 
  I would not delay the process of introducing vouchers. I 
am also in a way sceptical in this respect but later a 
redistribution of the property will take place. For instance, I 
can buy some property for, say, 100,000 coupons and if I fail to 
use it I will sell it for a higher or lower price. A 
redistribution, which is essential in the society developing in 
the way of market economy, will take place. [passage omitted] 
  Now, the issue of selling property for coupons. If we decide 
to sacrifice Georgia to the coupon, let us do it. I do not 
consider it a sin to regard the dollar as a principal criterion 
for the evaluation. The evaluation has to be done in dollars 
and then, if we insist that the coupon remain the only legal 
tender, let us accept the payment in the coupon equivalent of 
the dollar price. [passage omitted] 
  The best way to save the coupon is the revitlization of the 
economy. The best form is the development of entrepreneurship, 
proprietorship. [passage omitted] But I think that when we 
speak about the state property, the dollar must be considered as 
the principal unit of valuation. 
  About the concentration of the means received as a result of 
privatization. I am against including these in the general 
budget. I would back up an idea that these means should be 
accumulated in a fund created at the Ministry of State Property 
Management or in some other shape. The sum should accumulate at 
the bank. In case the sum freezes, it will not be worth a 
penny. The sum must be in circulation. And, in the first 
instance, I would return the money to entrepreneurs, to private 
business and I would give a new momentum to the business. 
[passage omitted] 
  Yet another point to be discussed. A law on bankruptcy must 
be initiated. I do not know when this will happen because now, 
with the current energy crisis, everyone is bankrupt and all 
enterprises must be sold. But it will not keep on like that, I 
suppose. I believe, the situation will improve in some time and 
then this law will be passed. It must be done by all means. 
Generally, laws that are passed, must be implemented and the 
bankruptcy law in particular. 
  Finally, a few words about the press. The press is not 
represented well here. There are some here but it is 
insufficient. [passage indistinct] 
  We speak about reforms frantically. This is a reform. What 
else is a reform? This is one of the most important parts of 
the reform. How can you blame the government for not 
implementing reforms when you yourself do not know what a reform 
is? If you do not know, come and let us learn together. I 
cannot say that Avtandil [Silagadze] has presented an ideal 
report but it is the best that can be presented today. There 
will be a new one, a better one in a year's time, because he 
will gain something from me, I will gain something from him. We 
are learning from each other. If we work jointly, we will 
advance along the road of reforms. Otherwise, only slogans 
remain. [Some say] we are the party which has a program of 
national salvation and something like this. This is a sheer 
paper and nothing else. These are empty phrases and nothing 
else. Programs of national salvation can be drafted only during 
a process of relations like this. I mean a process of learning 
and working together, criticizing one another, helping one 
another and looking for a way out of a political or economic 
crisis together. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Feb -- Four hundred Russian airborne 
assault troops from the peacemaking battalion deployed in the 
Serbian Krajina (Croatia) have today started to carry out their 
duties in the buffer zone between the confronting sides near 
Sarajevo. The settlements where the Russian "Blue Helmets" are 
to be accommodated will also be named today. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told this by the press service of the airborne 
assault troops. 
  According to the same source the Russian subunits, which 
arrived on Sunday evening in the area set by the United Nations 
for separating the sides, were met by Vitaliy Churkin, the 
Russian president's special envoy, by Russian Airborne Forces 
commander Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, and by his 
peacekeeping force deputy, Major General Nikolay Staskov. 
  In conjunction with the UN forces command they are to 
resolve 
the issue of the need to strengthen Russian peacekeeping forces 
in this region.

  [Text] Yerevan, 19 Feb, -- The Armenian authorities are 
convinced that there is no alternative to a peaceful settlement 
of the Karabakh conflict and that all strong-arm methods to 
resolve it are doomed to failure. This is stated in a statement 
published here today by the Armenian Foreign Ministry's press 
and public relations service. 
  The Armenian side, the statement says, considers that any 
mediation mission seeking a settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh will 
only bear fruit if it involves plenipotentiary representatives 
of the lawfully elected authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic. The Armenian Foreign Ministry press service issued 
the statement in connection with pronouncements by Azerbaijan's 
foreign policy department accusing the Armenian leadership of 
pursuing a policy of acting from a position of force and of 
continuing the occupation of Azerbaijan lands. 
  The Armenian Foreign Ministry press service statement 
emphasizes that the republic's authorities support all 
peacemaking efforts to establish peace in the region, including 
the CSCE and the Russian Federation initiatives.

  [Text] Baku, February 21 (TURAN) -- During Moscow's meeting 
which took place on February 18-19, the Defense Ministers of 
Azerbaijan, Mamedrafi Mamedov, and Armenia, Serzhe Sargisyan 
signed the "Protocol for a cease-fire". This document was 
signed by the representative of Nagorno-Karabakh, Bako Saakyan 
as well. The meeting was mediated by Russian Defense 
Minister, Pavel Grachev. 
  TURAN's Moscow's correspondent was told by the Russian 
Defense Minister that this document could be called "a protocol 
on intentions". It means that "the parties expressed their wish 
to cease hostilities, withdraw troops and withdraw from all 
occupied territories". Until now, an agreement defining the 
specifics has not been adopted yet. Presently, military experts 
are working on a draft of these agreements. The same source 
says that preliminary results of the work will be officially 
announced by the end of February and a cease-fire will be 
declared officially on March 1. 
  At the same time, a reliable employee from the Azerbaijani 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs told TURAN's reporter that "it is 
too early speak about that, since it is doubtful that both 
parties will agree to and implement the adopted obligations. 
The Armenian party has violated all earlier concluded 
agreements and occupies Azerbaijani territory", said the 
employee of the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It 
should be mentioned that the Russian peace initiative which 
special envoy of the Russian President, Vladimir Kazimirov, put 
forward in January for all intents and purposes coincides with 
the terms mentioned in the protocol of the Defense Ministers. 
Geydar Aliyev opposes Moscow's initiative. 
  The strict position of Pavel Grachev and his demands that 
the 
parties accept the terms of the truce, suggest that he is likely 
to force Baku [to] accept Moscow's conditions. 
  These facts are confirmed by the fighting in the 
Kelbadzharskiy region of Azerbaijan. According to sources in 
the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, special Russian troops took 
part in recent fighting against Azerbaijan. There are Russian 
troop divisions located in Armenia. 
  The latest Armenian success in the Kelbadzharskiy region 
would have been impossible without the participation of Russian 
troops, say military observers of the Azerbaijan Defense 
Ministry. 
  Russia once more applies the infamous carrot and stick to 
achieve its political aims. Pavel Grachev wants to pursue this 
policy having already succeeded diplomatically in Georgia.

"The Cease-Fire in Karabakh Is in Question"] 
  [Text] On Friday, 18 February, in Moscow military 
delegations of Armenia and Azerbaijan with the mediation of 
Russian Defense Minister General Grachev and the participation 
of a representative from Nagorno-Karabakh, and after seven hours 
of negotiations signed a cease-fire agreement. Yesterday, 
however, a "source close to the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]" contacted SEGODNYA to say that 
"the NKR Foreign Ministry learned about the Moscow agreement 
from the papers." 
  "NKR representative Bako Saakyan," who took part in the 
negotiations at the Russian Federation Defense Ministry on 18 
February, indeed is an officer of the NKR Defense Ministry but, 
according to Stepanakert, "he is in Moscow for medical treatment 
and has no official powers from NKR official bodies to act as a 
representative of Nagorno-Karabakh or sign anything on behalf of 
the NKR government." 
  Therefore, from the viewpoint of the NKR leadership, the 
agreement signed in Moscow has no binding legal force. This, as 
far as can be understood, does not mean that the NKR Defense 
Army is going to breach the relative cease-fire that has 
developed de facto in the last few days (from the lessening of 
hostilities to separate shoot-outs) on the Karabakh fronts. The 
NKR leadership has not planned any major offensive operations 
because the positions currently held by Armenian detachments 
generally suit Stepanakert. As for the terms of the three-stage 
plan, "On the Cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh and on the Border 
Between Armenia and Azerbaijan," proposed by Russia and 
partially coordinated last week in Moscow, they obviously do not 
please Stepanakert.

<F P=106> [Igor Lenskiy report under the rubric "Our Correspondents </F>
Report": "Karabakh: Give Peace a Chance"] 
  [Text] A working meeting in Moscow between V. Sarkisyan 
and M. Mamedov, Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers, with 
the mediation of their Russian colleague, General P. Grachev, 
and V. Kazimirov, Russian Federation Foreign Ministry special 
envoy, ended with a protocol on a full cease-fire in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh zone. Nagorno-Karabakh representative B. 
Saakyan also took part in the meeting; he sat separately from 
the state delegations, a fact which symbolizes the autonomous 
participation of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in 
the conflict. 
  We were told by the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense 
that a definitive date for the cease-fire would be established 
later, following coordination with the political leadership of 
Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh. According to the 
testimony of an officer from the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense, who took part in the talks, the atmosphere was entirely 
amicable. Although the full text of the signed document will 
not be published for certain reasons, the officer made it clear 
that the protocol also contains more specific agreements. 
  Which specific agreements? Ramiz Rizayev, Azerbaijani 
ambassador in Moscow and participant in the talks, stated in an 
interview with PRAVDA that the withdrawal of the Armenian troops 
from the occupied areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh has also been 
coordinated and that this is an indispensable condition of the 
truce. The approximate deadline -- 1 March -- was also 
determined, but the schedule and other details are still being 
discussed by the experts. The status of Nagorno-Karabakh and 
the fate of the enclave as a whole were not the subject of the 
talks and will be resolved later on during the peace process. 
  Despite the first optimistic results of the quadripartite 
meeting, so far it is difficult to judge whether serious 
progress has been reached in untying the tight Karabakh knot. 
There are no clear guarantees of how the commitments that have 
been assumed will be observed, and when and in what form 
peacekeeping forces will be put into operation. B. Yeltsin and 
N. Nazarbayev already tried to reconcile the opponents in 
Zheleznovodsk in fall 1991 (and, it seemed, not without 
success), and there have been several hopeful agreements within 
the framework of the CSCE. However, in the attempt to move from 
words to action, each time the peace signal turned out to be 
false. Will today's protocol stand the test of time?

  [Text] Aram Safaryan held a news conference at the Armenian 
Foreign Ministry today. 
  The Foreign Ministry press secretary referred to the 
cease-fire agreement concluded among Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, 
and Azerbaijan in Moscow last Friday [18 February] with the 
mediation of Russia and noted that it is another step on the way 
toward peacefully resolving the Karabakh conflict and 
establishing peace in the region. The Armenian authorities 
welcome such a step and will do everything possible to find ways 
toward the peaceful resolution of the conflict. Now everything 
depends on the stance to be adopted by Azerbaijan and 
Nagorno-Karabakh. It is very important that the agreement on a 
complete cease-fire was also signed by the representative of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. This is another confirmation that Karabakh is 
being recognized as one of the main sides to the conflict. 
  Safaryan also highlighted that in addition to the 
cease-fire, 
the agreement also envisages the deployment of peacekeeping 
forces between the armed formations of Azerbaijan and 
Nagorno-Karabakh all along the conflict zone. Of course, no one 
should overestimate the importance of this document, after all, 
agreements on a cease-fire were concluded in the past but never 
implemented because of Azerbaijan, but it should not be berated 
at the same time because this is undoubtedly another step in the 
difficult process of establishing peace. 
  The latest developments in the region have generated the 
need 
to conduct active diplomatic contacts. This is why Armenian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Zhirair Liparityan met Vladimir 
Kazimirov, the Russian president's ambassador on special 
missions, in Moscow. During his 90 minutes of talks with Turkish 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin in Ankara on 21 February, they 
examined issues relating to the peaceful resolution of the 
Karabakh conflict. Liparityan will also visit France and 
Germany, where he will meet Foreign Ministry officials. These 
contact are important because both countries are members of the 
CSCE Minsk Group and should be able to clarify views on 
particular issues relating to the measures envisaged by the CSCE 
Minsk Group. At the end of the week, Liparityan will visit 
Iran. Armenia's relations with Iran are thriving and must be 
expanded in every sphere of cooperation. 
  Safaryan noted that Armenia aspires to establish good 
neighborly relations with all its neighbors in the region. In 
this context, Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan's upcoming visit 
to Israel is particularly important. The visit is planned for 
6-9 March.

  [Text] Moscow February 22 TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry praised a special protocol signed by the Azerbaijani 
and Armenian defence ministers and a Nagorno-Karabakh military 
representative, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Tuesday [22 
February]. 
  The protocol was signed on February 18 as a result of talks 
mediated by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev and attended 
by the Russian president's special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov. 
The document provides for a complete cease-fire and termination 
of combat operations, as well as for troops disengagement. At 
the moment. A joint group of experts is working out a procedure 
for putting this protocol into practice. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry called upon all warring sides 
to 
strictly observe the reached agreements and to go ahead on their 
basis with concluding a full-scale political accord. 
  "The Russian Foreign Ministry welcomes the aspirations of 
the 
warring sides to put an end to bloodshed, to help fulfil 
resolutions by the U.N. Security Council to this effect and to 
promote an all-round settlement of the conflict within the 
framework of the CSCE peace conference on Nagorno-Karabakh," the 
ministry said in the statement.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 
the Fatherland Defenders Day which is marked in Russia today: 
  "The Russian army -- just as the entire Russia, which left 
behind its military bases, air defence systems and combat 
hardware in ex-Soviet republics -- lives through hard times". 
  By way of example, the newspaper mentions the Tajik-Afghan 
border, from which disquieting reports come in every day, and 
where Russian servicemen get killed. 
  "But Russian troops do not quit. They just have no right to 
leave, for that would mean the death of many thousands of 
people... As long as the peoples of various coutnries apply to 
Russia for help, Russia still remains a great military power". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the army's economic problems 
and its prestige in society. 
  In Russia, the defender of the fatherland has always meant 
more than just a man with a rifle. But lately the prestige of 
the officer and soldirer in the eyes of society is not as high 
as one would like it to be. Quite often the army was 
undeservedly criticised, the newspaper lamented. 
  "But the main thing is that however hard the idea of the 
defence of the fatherland and its proponents were defamed, they 
survived and upheld the thesis that this idea is a sacred notion 
and that the defender of the fatherland is the person's social 
status", the newspaepr pointed out. 
  TRUD on the state of affairs in Russia's armed forces. 
  The newspaper comes to a conclusion that the defenders of 
the 
fatherland themselves are in need of protection. "Infantry 
officers are no longer willing to draw guard duty instead of 
soldiers or to shovel coal in garrison stoke-holds. 
  "Air pilots get sick of waiting for fuel tanker-trucks, not 
flying weather. Navy men feel miserable at the quay wall 
without long-distance voyages... 
  "The army now wants one thing -- to be an army: to drive 
vehicles, to fire, fly, and navigate the seas, shoot down 
training targets, bring up men, and live a decent life, without 
the need to think about referenda and the living bread, or 
figure in palace coups. The army wants to serve the 
fartherland, not politicians". 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the Sarajevo situation and on Russia's 
role in easing tension there. 
  The newspaper points out that it is in many respects due to 
Russia's stance that there has been no "Balkan storm" operation. 
  "Throughout last week, the entire world closely followed the 
development of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Balkans again 
turned into 'europe's powder keg' which could go off with 
unpredictable consequences for the old world. 
  "Nevertheless, the conflict is not yet over. International 
diplomacy is yet to make a good deal of effort to undo the tight 
knot of Bosnian contradictions. 
  "The West should draw two lessons from the situation taking 
shape there: that the crisis situation in the former Yugoslavia 
cannot be resolved behind the back of Russia and in disregard 
for her interests. The time has come to abandon the approach 
according to which 'it is the Serbs that should pay for 
everything', and to place equally tough demands upon all the 
sides involved in the Bosnian conflict". 
  TRUD on the Russian Government's economic reform policy. 
  The newspaper carries an interview with academician Nikolay 
Petrakov, a prominent Russian economist and director of the 
academy Institute on Market Studies. The interview dealt with 
matters aimed at promoting further economic development of 
Russia. 
  Petrakov said "the market idea has been discredited". 
According to him, for two years more than 50 million people in 
Russia (who account for more than a third of the country's 
population) "live below the subsistence wage", as against 17 
million in 1991 when every tenth was in straits whereas now 
every third is destitute. 
  Petrakov believes that it is essential to adjust reforms 
"which must be with a human face, using the old Czechoslovak 
slogan." with this end in view, the academician suggests in 
particular that the taxation system be radically changed and an 
in-depth agrarian reform be carried out. "private ownership is 
the main principle of the market while the ownership of land is 
its foundation," he added. 
  ROSSIYA newspaper runs an interview with Anatoliy Chubays 
who 
describes the course of privatisation. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA frontpages a forecast as to which kind 
of 
report will be delivered by President Boris Yeltsin in the 
federal assembly in the Kremlin on Thursday. 
  The newspaper believes that the president must show that he 
is not only prepared "to further and deepen reforms" but is also 
aware of the entire "complexity and painfulness of the process" 
and point out the achievements of Russian diplomacy "in 
resolving the Bosnian crisis".

  [Text] Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on Tuesday [22 February] called on LDP 
deputies to adhere to party unity. 
  Last week, three party officials -- Viktor Kobelyev, 
Vyacheslav Marychyev and Alexander Pronin -- spoke of their 
disagreement with actions and speeches by Party Chairman 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Deputy Speaker of the State Duma 
Aleksandr Vengerovskiy. 
  Zhirinovskiy said that "no one stands to benefit from any 
disarray within party ranks." As an example, he pointed to the 
Russia's Choice Party which was defeated in the December 
election because of disunity despite an enormous financial 
backing and President Yeltsin's rule of the country. 
  "We have unity, a policy and leader and the party's rating 
is 
going up at a breakneck speed," he said. 
  The LDP leader warned that from now on, any conflicts must 
be 
resolved within the faction and should never be taken up with 
parliament. "What our opponents want is party infighting and we 
must not give them a chance," he said. 
  Zhirinovskiy called to suppress any betrayal from within. 
"If 
you dislike it, put your party card and deputy mandate on the 
table and start from scratch in some other party," he told the 
LDP deputies. 
  Zhirinovskiy also said that to avert a party split, the 
party 
chairman must be granted congressional powers in between party 
congresses offering for appropriate amendments to be made in 
party rules during the LDP's next forum in April. In his view, 
the party leader must be made responsible for all issues -- 
personnel, financial and others -- in between party congresses. 
The LDP's supreme council should play a consultative role while 
the party chairman "like Russia in the U.N. Security Council" 
must be allowed to veto down any council resolutions, 
Zhirinovskiy said. This brought no comment from council members. 
  Zhirinovskiy said that from now on, his first deputy and 
editor-in-chief of the party sponsored "Liberal" newspaper 
Stanislav Zhebrovskiy would handle contacts with the LDP's 
regional branches (earlier, Viktor Kobelyev's area of 
responsibility). One other council member Aleksandr 
Vengerovskiy is to be responsible for day-to-day management of 
the party faction in parliament. 
  The two disgraced party members, Viktor Kobelyev and 
Aleksandr Pronin, were conspicuously absent at the meeting while 
the third one, Vyacheslav Marychyev, left it five minutes after 
journalists. Eyewitnesses say there was "a tough male talk" in 
those five minutes with Marychyev demanding an apology from 
Vengerovskiy for having called him "a black sheep" in a recent 
TV interview. Marychyev told reporters that he would quit the 
party unless Vengerovskiy apologized.

<F P=106> [Nadezhda Garifullina report: "The Russian Path -- The </F>
Third Russian National Union Congress Is Over"] 
  [Text] The Third Russian National Union [RNU] Congress 
took place over two days in Moscow, gathering together around 
150 delegates from more than 50 regions of the Russian 
Federation. 
  The main event of the first day was information from State 
Duma and Federation Council deputies A. Lukyanov, V. Isakov, S. 
Baburin, Ye. Pavlov, V. Tikhonov, S. Glotiv, and others on the 
work of the new parliament, and their answers to numerous 
questions from the delegates. On the second day there was a 
general political discussion on two reports: "On Making 
Amendments and Additions to the Russian National Union Rules," 
which was delivered by RNU Coordinating Council Chairman S. 
Baburin, and "On the Political and Socioeconomic Situation in 
the Country and the Tasks of the Russian National Union," 
presented by N. Pavlov. 
  On proclaiming the creation of the RNU social movement in 
October 1991, its initiators stressed the following in the 
program document: The new movement "must be national in order 
to embrace Russians and Bashkirs, Yakuts and Ukrainians, Germans 
and Poles, the peoples of the Volga Region and the North 
Caucasus. We consider the sole demand upon participants in the 
movement to be a feeling of love for our common motherland, 
Russia." Now, however, Nikolay Pavlov believes that the RNU 
must be a movement of Russian citizens, the Russian people, and 
that it must defend the interests of the Russian nation. Many 
who spoke did not agree with him, in the light of which N. 
Pavlov offered his resignation. However, the congress did not 
accept it. 
  A far-reaching discussion was also conducted on the draft 
program statement "The Russian Path," in which the basic aims in 
the sphere of politics, economics, culture, and the social 
sphere are defined, and it was again stressed that the RNU is 
not purely a Russian movement but is open to representatives of 
any nation and nationality living on Russian territory. 
  "I am satisfied with the Congress, although it did not pass 
off completely smoothly," Sergey Baburin said when I requested a 
comment on the results of the forum. "We adopted a decision to 
reform the sociopolitical movement into a political party -- 
that is, to effect a reorganization, and to strengthen the party 
principles of the RNU. Together with this, I consider it to be 
of major importance that we should preserve the opportunity for 
RNU members to participate in other political parties and social 
organizations whose programs do not contradict our political 
views. Obviously, the criticism directed at our friends and 
allies was just -- I am thinking of the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the 
Agrarian Party, and others. After all, if all they receive is 
praise, if we do not criticize, how can they find their bearings? 
  "I was also pleased that the congress participants 
approached 
the question of our political line and priorities in the 
political program very seriously. We adopted the program 
statement `The Russian Path' as a basis for further work and we 
hope that regional organizations will work earnestly on the 
provisions of the program, which we hope to adopt in November 
1994. Prior to the registration of our amended rules by the 
Ministry of Justice, we will be guided by the existing rules, 
but we will try to keep the transition period -- from movement 
to party -- down to a minimum. As for Nikolay Pavlov's 
resignation, the congress rejected it unanimously, and we 
declared that Pavlov is destined to gain victory together with 
and as part of the RNU."

  [Text] Former general of Soviet political intelligence 
Oleg Kalugin, who is on trial for spreading false reports about 
the alleged existence of "collusion" between the KGB and the 
well-known public and state figure Sergey Baburin, has been 
unable to present any documentary evidence of his public 
"exposures." 
  For six months he failed to appear at Kuntsevskiy Rayon 
Court 
in the city of Moscow, where legal action to defend the honor 
and dignity of the State Duma deputy and leader of the Russian 
All-National Union is in progress against O. Kalugin and the 
newspaper IZVESTIYA. On Tuesday 15 February the defendant 
appeared before the court. During the hearing he basically 
confirmed that his action was prompted by political motives: He 
had to discredit Baburin. 
  Addressing the court, Sergey Baburin reminded those present 
that "Kalugin's slanderous statements were reproduced by dozens 
and dozens of mass media sources, to be relished and publicly 
commented on by his political opponents." But he has not yet 
received any apology for the offending article.

<F P=106> [Anri Vartanov report: "Television Viewers Deprived of </F>
Almost All Their Television Programs Taken In by Three Myths"] 
  [Text] Last week millions of television viewers got a 
shock. Communications personnel, who are owed 80 billion rubles 
[R] by television for last year, cut off transmission in many 
regions of the country. For a whole day fans of Santa Barbara 
[soap opera] scoured the news agency reports with bated breath 
for news of the development of the conflict. 
  In the evening many breathed a sigh of relief: It was 
reported that Premier Chernomyrdin had ordered that television's 
debts to the Ministry of Communications be paid. True, this is 
to be in stages. It is not difficult to guess that with each 
stage, given today's inflation, the sum will "diminish," which, 
understandably, will not induce enthusiasm among the 
communications workers. 
  Nor should it be forgotten that this year's debts will 
quickly augment last year's. At a press conference on Monday 
the leaders of the television companies reported that for 1994 
they had been allocated only 18 percent of the sum required. It 
is not difficult to guess that six weeks from now, at the end of 
the first quarter, the communications personnel will again have 
grounds for raising the question of switching off our television 
sets. 
  It is perfectly clear therefore that the problem needs a 
fundamental solution. Today it would seem the heavyweights of 
this world have grasped this simple truth. The premier spoke of 
the need to abandon a number of state television channels on the 
very evening of the day when the crisis in relations between 
television and the Ministry of Communications was resolved. But 
quite a few difficulties are concealed behind the outward 
simplicity. 
  Sometimes naive people regard denationalization as a magic 
wand which will immediately enable all questions to be removed. 
In this latest conflict, for example, the myth has arisen 
thanks to someone that the communications workers are owed money 
only by state companies, the private ones having emerged with 
spotless year-end results. Indeed they don't have any debts. 
But why? The point is that TV-6 enjoys a special satellite 
communications link, while NTV only started operating quite 
recently and so has not had time to get into debt. 
  The Ministry of Communications' complaints about poverty, 
which is prompting the strikes, is yet another myth. It is, of 
course, a thankless task to count the money in someone else's 
pocket, but, according to certain sources, the monopolists' 
earnings in this sphere are considerably above the average for 
other sectors of the economy. 
  Finally, there is a third myth, to wit, the opinion that 
television and "Ostankino," in particular, is, through 
advertising, raking in millions in foreign currency and billions 
in rubles, and that it shares it with no one. Indeed, a lot has 
been written recently about abuses perpetrated by certain smart 
operators in television. However, something else must also be 
said: "Ostankino" not only pays taxes to the state but also 
"releases" quite a considerable amount of the large sum of money 
it has to the Television Center, which owns all the television 
company's property and equipment . 
  In the opinion of A. Pimanov, deputy director of 
"Ostankino's" "Publitsist" Studio, neither share-flotation nor 
even the introduction of subscription payments for the use of 
televison receivers is capable of rescuing Europe's largest 
television company from financial failure. A whole set of 
different measures is required here. It is essential to have a 
separate bank and to put to work the money obtained from the 
state. The progress of every ruble should be tracked and the 
maximum return on it secured. Channels through which money is 
lost to television production must be plugged. 
  But that is not enough, according to Pimanov. It is time to 
stop shifting money from one pocket to another with considerable 
losses en route. The practice which formerly prevailed at 
"Ostankino" and which is the rule throughout the world should be 
restored. After all nowhere, and that includes in the second 
largest Russian television company, is the creative side 
separated from the technical. The long-drawn-out question of 
the autonomousness of the Television Center, which has been 
artificially isolated from the single television organism, must 
finally be resolved. Incidentally, the Television Center 
recently, without any warning whatsoever, announced a 
retroactive increase, effective as of last December, in all 
prices for the services offered to "Ostankino." And these were 
up to fourfold increases! 
  It is clear here that the television company will never be 
able to extricate itself from the trammels of unpaid debts. It 
will not be saved by crumbs from the government budget table, 
shareholders' investments, or even a subscription payment by 
millions of ordinary viewers.

  [Text] As we have already reported, the Russian Finance 
Ministry has drawn up a draft budget for 1994. The ministry 
believes its deficit should be 55 trillion rubles. The 
expenditure part comes to 178 trillion. We asked Finance 
Minister Sergey Dubinin what this money is going to be spent on. 
This is what he told us in a telephone interview. 
  [Begin Dubinin recording] The expenditure part of the budget 
reflects those real outlays which have been planned by the 
government, set by the laws and resolutions, so to speak, and 
which we, the Finance Ministry, would not dare propose 
rescinding. We are proposing simply rescinding a whole series 
of laws, a whole series of resolutions, which we are simply 
unable to underpin financially with revenue, but there are 
things which inevitably have to be financed. 
  Quite a large amount in our budget is spent, of course, on 
social and cultural measures. This comes to tens of trillions 
of rubles, and all this is a continuation of our policy aimed at 
supporting, on the one hand, the most needy areas, and also 
extending selective support to production sectors with capital 
investments, and in some areas, as in agriculture and the coal 
industry, with subsidies, although subsidies, of course, are not 
the best way of spending money. 
  Russia's budget, like that of any other state, is burdened 
with the same historical state prerogatives, that is, the 
country's defense, international activity, the social sphere, 
and certain economic matters. 
  There is hardly any point in telling you about the whole 
structure of the budget, especially as this is a draft, and 
there will clearly be certain alterations to it after the 
government has examined it, it has its own drafts, and it will 
be submitted to the State Duma. We tried at least to prevent 
the situation of industries and the social sphere from getting 
any worse, although it is quite difficult to do that when output 
is being cut generally, and the country is in a state of crisis. 
It is quite difficult to ensure a rise in the finance of one 
area or another, it is scarcely possible. 
  Otherwise the whole structure of the budget has to be 
radically altered, say, totally stop financing one area and 
switch to another. Since no-one has taken such decisions, the 
structure of the 1994 budget will to a large extent look like 
the structure of the 1993 one. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Sergey Razin report: "Chubays Parts Easily With His </F>
Voucher"] 
  [Text] "But the caravan keeps on rolling." This was 
Anatoliy Chubays' comment at a Goskomimushchestvo [State 
Committee for the Management of State Property] collegium 
session on Moscow's intention to do away with voucher 
privatization. The last of the reformers promised to protect 
Muscovites from the capital's government. In his opinion, 
Goskomimushchestvo has enough levers of power to exhibit 
Moscow's largest and most attractive enterprises at the 
forthcoming check auctions. Otherwise the authorities will have 
to explain themselves to the president. 
  The collegium spent the entire session in optimistic mood, 
anticipating a quick finish to voucher denationalization of the 
state economy. Goskomimushchestvo Deputy Chairman Dmitriy 
Vasilyev reported that 900 enterprises a month are being sold 
off for vouchers at auction. Which means that before 1 July 
another 4,500 firms will go under the hammer and we will be able 
to kiss good-bye to the state sector altogether. 
  Perhaps the most absorbing question for everyone at the 
collegium was this: Where have all the vouchers gotten to? A 
group of directors from Tula is thoroughly exasperated by the 
local citizens who have absolutely no desire to surrender their 
checks to state enterprises. 
  Such is life! It seems the vouchers have sailed away to 
other, more distant climes. One of the bosses of "Alfa-Kapital" 
frankly confessed in his speech to the collegium that there are 
almost 1 million vouchers lying in his storage vaults! Other 
speakers calculated that the largest commercial structures have 
relieved people of more than 20 million vouchers alone, and 
approximately 900 check and investment funds of various kinds 
popped up in 1993. 
  However, "Alfa-Kapital" may appositely be compared to a big 
and hypertrophied version of Plyushkin [miser in Gogol's "Dead 
Souls"], hiding its vouchers in barns and lumber rooms. 
Businessmen are currently backing these structures in order to 
tap into the tastiest industrial morsels that will soon be up 
for grabs. 
  Herein, basically, lies all the tension of the present 
moment: Who will get their hands on the state property? The 
refashioning of the state sector is almost over: Sector chiefs 
and Moscow mandarins are about to be deprived of their strongest 
authority -- the right to manage real estate. This authority is 
about to be transferred to independent commercial capital.

Yeltsin said in a message of greetings to the armed forces and 
war veterans on the occasion of the day of motherland defenders 
marked on February 23. 
  "The armed forces are a core of the Russian statehood, 
guarantor of peace, stability and democratic gains. They should 
be powerful, mobile and equipped with the most efficient 
armaments. The state will do everything to increase the 
prestige of military profession and make servicemen and members 
of their families feel better protected in the social sphere," 
the president added. 
  "The day of motherland defenders is a special holiday. It is 
marked by the entire people, who pay tribute and show respect 
and gratitude to Russian servicemen. 
  "Russian servicemen were the first to counteract forces, 
which tried to destroy our state with fire and sword and enslave 
our people. They saved Russia in the most difficult, mortally 
dangerous moments of war. 
  "You, the servicemen of the armed forces, are worthy heirs 
and successors of military traditions. At a time of trial you 
show restraint and firmness and honestly fulfill the 
professional and civic duty. 
  "I wish you, dear servicemen, your dear and near, veterans 
and civilian personnel of the armed forces, health, happiness 
and prosperity. Glory, honor and gratitude to you for your hard 
work and success to you in life and military service!" says the 
message.

<F P=106> [Igor Chernyak report: "Will Russian Soldiers Wash Their </F>
Boots in the North Atlantic?"] 
  [Text] The upper echelons of the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry and Foreign Intelligence Service are treating 
the idea of Russia's entry into NATO under the "Partnership for 
Peace" program extremely cautiously. In brief, military and 
intelligence personnel mainly fear that Russia could be deprived 
of the opportunity autonomously to choose a model for future 
military building and development and for reforming the Army and 
Navy: The Russian Armed Forces could cease to be an independent 
military organization, and in the light of that the Russian 
Federation could switch from being an autonomous factor for 
security and stability in the world to being an element 
subordinate to another mechanism. 
  In the words of one participant in the recent 
Russian-American seminar devoted to these problems in the 
Russian Federation Center for National Security Problems, the 
U.S. representatives often simply failed to dispel the Russians' 
fears. They were forestalled by a representative of the Russian 
Federation Foreign Ministry, who defended the partners' 
interests with even greater fervor than they themselves. The 
Foreign Ministry leadership's interest in joining the 
"Partnership" and NATO can be explained: As a result of gross 
foreign policy miscalculations in neighboring foreign states, 
powerful political and military clots have formed -- Tajikistan, 
Moldova, Georgia-Abkhazia, and Armenia-Azerbaijan -- which the 
Russian Federation cannot resolve alone. So a gamble is being 
placed on NATO peacekeeping forces. However, in the view of a 
number of military experts, these would be false gains.

  [Text] Kiev -- Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn 
Landyk, has informed a UNIAN correspondent that a telephone 
conversation took place on 22 February between Acting Prime 
Minister Yuhym Zvyahilskyy and representatives of the Turkmen 
Government on the matter of the suspension of the gas supply 
from Turkmenistan to Ukraine. 
  Following the Ukrainian side's reasoning that: "No one has 
done this before. If God has given you gas, it is not worth 
abusing this," a preliminary accord was reached on selling 
60,000 tonnes of wheat to Turkmenistan to credit the debt and 
payment by Ukraine of $50 million of the 150 million debt. 
After this, it is likely that the supply of gas to Ukraine will 
be resumed.

continuing his visit to Germany. In an interview to the leading 
German newspaper FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG, Anatoliy Zlenko 
said: We did not make a mistake when we thought that the 
Yugoslav crisis should be settled by political means. A 
bombardment can only escalate the conflict. The Ukrainian 
foreign minister emphasized that the search is under way right 
now for political resolution of the Balkan problem, which is 
evidenced by the Russian proposal. Asked about Ukraine's 
participation in the UN-sponsored peace keeping mission in 
Yugoslavia, Anatoliy Zlenko said that the Ukrainian contingent 
of the blue helmets will increase by an additional 800 people.

  [Text] Vice Foreign Minister of Ukraine Boris Tarasyuk 
speaking at a news conference in Kiev on Tuesday [22 February] 
called on Russia to end attacks on his republic concerning the 
safety of nuclear weapons deployed on its territory. On the 
IZVESTIYA newspaper's recent publication on the issue of part of 
the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal deployed in Ukraine, 
he said there were certain forces in Russia who did not want to 
see any normalization between Kiev and Moscow. 
  Tarasyuk also said that the article should disclose the 
Russian defence minister's secret letters and cables was not all 
random. He called for putting the issue on the agenda of the 
next CIS summit. 
  IZVESTIYA referring to informed sources maintains that 
commander of the long range nuclear weapons general Igor 
Sergeyev is no longer in control of the 43rd missile army 
deployed in Ukraine. Sergeyev says that "Russia is in no way 
able to monitor the safety of nuclear weapons deployed in 
Ukraine or guarantee their inadvertent use." 
  However, Deputy Defence Minister of Ukraine Ivan Bizhan said 
that Kiev retained administrative control of the nuclear forces 
while Russia was still in charge of operational and management 
control. He said that all functions of the military planning and 
duty were part of the operational control something that Ukraine 
would never interfere with. 
  Bizhan described as a lie the paper's allegations saying the 
Ukrainian nuclear force was grossly undermanned. He put the 
43rd army was staffed by 85 percent in officers and 100 percent 
in non-commissioned officers and men. More than 80 percent of 
officers are Ukrainian citizens, Bizhan said. 
  The Ukrainian official warned that the IZVESTIYA publication 
might strain relations between Kiev and Moscow.

  [Text] A briefing held yesterday at the Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry assessed the publication with a pretentious heading -- 
commander in chief disclaims responsibility for safety of 
nuclear missiles in Ukraine -- published by the newspaper 
IZVESTIYA on 22 February 1994 as a regular attempt of specific 
circles in the Russian Federation to exacerbate 
Russian-Ukrainian relations. Our correspondent Ihor Bak was 
present at this briefing. 
  [Begin Bak recording] First of all, I would like to clarify 
the matter for those who had not read this article. It says 
that Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of the 
Russian Strategic Missile Forces, disclaims responsibility for 
the safety of nuclear missiles deployed on Ukrainian soil. He 
reported on his decision in an official letter to the Russian 
defense minister. IZVESTIYA cites this letter and the facts 
which, as IZVESTIYA puts it, can cause social explosion in the 
missile units deployed on Ukrainian territory and produce 
unforeseeable consequences. 
  Therefore, at the briefing, Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, 
Ukrainian deputy defense minister, refuted all the figures and 
facts cited by IZVESTIYA. He admitted as trustworthy only the 
information on the number of launchers for SS-19 and SS-24 
missiles which remained in combat readiness. Ivan Bizhan deemed 
as an invention claims that the commander of the 43d Missile 
Army Uladymir Mikhtyuk was forced to swear the Ukrainian loyalty 
oath. He is commander of the Army in which the prevailing 
majority of officers and warrant officers had voluntarily sworn 
allegiance to Ukraine. Moreover, history [as heard] makes 
officers -- who for some reasons do not want to do it -- swear 
loyalty to Ukraine. Due to the fact that they are specialists 
needed by Ukraine, nobody dismisses them from their positions. 
The officer strength level in the Ukrainian Missile Forces 
stands at over 85 percent and not at 60 percent, as IZVESTIYA 
reports. There are no reasons to make a fuss concerning the 
nuclear weapons in Ukraine, stated Ukrainian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Borys Tarasyuk, at the briefing. At the same time, he 
drew the attention of the journalists to the fact that IZVESTIYA 
had more than once published texts of coded messages and other 
classified documents. Therefore, this newspaper violates the 
agreement on state secrets signed by CIS states. [end recording]

  [Text] According to the message of the Ukrainian radio 
broadcast on Tuesday evening, in his interview with Radio 
Svoboda President Leonid Kravchuk declared about his intention 
not to participate in the presidential elections scheduled for 
June 26, 1994. 
  Explaining his move, he said that in his opinion it is 
hardly 
expedient to hold elections so soon. Kravchuk believes that 
presidential elections, to be held immediately after the 
parliamentary elections on March 27, will result in the 
excessive politicizing of society. 
  The second reason he gave for his unwillingness to run was 
the fact that he now bears a part of the responsibility for the 
present social and economic situation in Ukraine as "a man who 
is currently working." In his opinion, in the case of his 
participation, his contenders would spend their forces not to 
develop constructive programs but to prove that the present 
president has failed to fulfill his duties. 
  A commentator of the Ukrainian radio expressed regret due to 
the fact that this statement was provided for Radio Svoboda but 
not for the state TV and radio company. According to the 
commentator, "the presidential explanations do not look 
persuasive." "There are more questions than answers in the 
president's statement," said the commentator who preferred to 
stay anonymous.

  [Text] In an interview to Radio Liberty, Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk announced his final decision not to 
participate in the next presidential campaign. The newspaper 
DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA published today an excerpt from this 
interview. In short, the president explains his decision as 
follows. The election to the Supreme Council will definitely 
drag out and be held in two rounds. Then, no sooner a new 
parliament gets a chance to work than the presidential election 
will follow. It hardly makes sense to do this in such a short 
time. Second, in Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, participation in 
the elections would mean that he justifies the present economic 
and social situation. Third, the president believes that other 
candidates for this post do not direct all of their efforts at a 
constructive program, but at proving that he failed to perform 
his duties. 
  To be perfectly honest, the declaration by Leonid Makarovych 
Kravchuk came as a surprise, if only because we learned about 
the decision of the president, who was elected by all the 
people, not from a national source but from the foreign media. 
Although we learned from the sources close to the president 
that he retains his point of view, one cannot rid oneself of 
doubts regarding the reasoning of Leonid Makarovych. He does 
not want to exacerbate the political situation by his 
participation in the elections. But will his lack of 
participation not produce exactly this kind of result? Can one 
perceive the participation of Leonid Makarovych in the elections 
as his protection of the present complex economic and social 
situation? Perhaps on the contrary, is it not his lack of 
participation that will rather testify to the incorrectness of 
the previous course? 
  Finally, his third point about criticism of the president on 
the part of his rivals in the campaign. Can one ever imagine an 
election race without this in any democratic country? In one 
word, the decision by Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk not to 
participate in the next elections for the Ukrainian president 
contains more questions than answers.

  [Text] Prominent Russian economist Yevgeniy Saburov, who 
was offered the post of Crimean premier by Crimean President 
Yuriy Meshkov, is flying out to Simferopol on Tuesday [22 
February]. Saburov told Interfax a few hours before his 
departure that besides the Crimean capital he was planning to 
visit other cities of the Republic of Crimea (which is part of 
Ukraine). 
  To quote Saburov, his trip will last for 10 days. He is 
planning to evaluate the current state of the Crimean economy 
and legislation, and collect material necessary for drafting a 
strategy for Crimea's economic development. 
  Saburov will be accompanied by a group of experts most of 
whom come from Crimea. 
  Since his appointment to the post of Crimean prime minister, 
they have been busy studying the Crimean economy. 
  The new premier refused to name members of the future 
Crimean 
Cabinet. "I don't think any decisions should be taken in haste. 
We shall decide everything on the spot," he said. 
  No talks with the Ukrainian leaders figure in the program of 
the trip. "Such talks are premature," said Saburov. He noted, 
however, that if any of the Ukrainian leaders decided to hold 
the talks they would take place immediately.

<F P=106> [Yelena Pavlova article including interview with Yevgeniy </F>
Saburov under the rubric "Man of the Week": "Perhaps It Will Be 
Warmer in the Crimea"] 
  [Text] Yevgeniy Saburov could quite possibly be called man 
of the week. He was twice at the center of public attention. 
The newspaper recently published his program for the Russian 
Government. Next week this well-known economist is flying to 
the Crimea. He has been invited there by Yuriy Meshkov, the 
leader of the government, who was recently elected president of 
the Republic of the Crimea. 
  The temperature on the peninsula is above zero. Local 
residents are already concerned about the approaching sowing 
work and in addition, of course, at the rising unemployment, the 
stoppage of enterprises, the rising cost of living, and the low 
wages. Generally speaking, then, it is like everywhere else. 
Will the political temperature change after the Russian 
Government team's arrival in the Crimea? 
  "It is hard to say," candidly admitted the 47-year old 
Saburov, who has spent almost all his life since graduation from 
the Moscow State University-Mechanical-Mathematical Department 
devoting himself to sectoral economics. "I am going there as an 
economist but there is work for a politician down there, too." 
  "Will Saburov take all his ministers with him from Moscow?" 
  "No, no way," he himself answered as he opened the door. "It 
will be necessary to form a balanced cabinet on the spot and we 
will have to include local representatives. Anyway, in 
principle I have not actually been appointed. At the moment, 
Yuriy Meshkov has only invited me to fill this post and I have 
agreed. Now it is necessary to study the law most carefully -- 
and see how it is to be done..." 
  [Pavlova] Within Leonid Kravchuk's entourage the opinion has 
already been expressed that according to the law there cannot be 
a premier in the Crimea, is that not so? 
  [Saburov] I think that this is the initial reaction, that is 
all. There has been some misunderstanding here -- we will 
investigate it together. 
  In Saburov's opinion, he is aware of how complex the status 
of the Crimea is and how difficult relations there could be in 
the future. But he is convinced that pro-Ukrainian people will 
not present serious opposition to his "duet" with Yuriy Meshkov. 
Even die-hard nationalists are still looking out for the 
well-being of their nation. If the government team sets itself 
the task of raising the living standard of the Crimean people 
and if the specialists who have been invited in do not merely 
state this but actually get down to tackling the urgent 
questions here, things could improve. 
  What are the priorities in the Crimea? My interlocutor, a 
candidate of economic sciences, believes that one of the 
paramount and main problems is the establishment of market 
relations there. 
  [Pavlova] In your opinion, are the reforms in the republic 
going extremely sluggishly? 
  [Saburov] They have almost ground to a halt. This is where 
that half-forgotten word, acceleration, is needed -- not in the 
formal sense of the word, of course. My task is to ensure that 
all citizens have the opportunity to work, to ensure that those 
employed in the state's service get their pay on time, that 
everyone has water and electricity, and that public transport 
works properly. This is the policy, but it is a national 
economic policy. Sorting it out will not be all that easy. 
  [Pavlova] Do you consider the problem of the [Black Sea] 
fleet an economic policy? After all, one way or another it will 
have to be dealt with? 
  [Saburov] Without fail. My task is to ensure that the Black 
Sea Fleet gets prompt finance and, to put it crudely, that the 
officers and seamen do not starve. And to ensure that, come 
what may, the fleet does not become a seething cauldron of 
passions. [Saburov ends] 
  It was difficult not to ask Saburov about the fleet. And the 
conversation on that theme was, to put it bluntly, not a brief 
one. But his main idea was this: To take all measures 
necessary to ease the social tension in the fleet. Furthermore, 
he said the same thing about the residents of settlements and 
cities. The measures needed there are somewhat different -- a 
reliance on small- and medium-scale business, which will give 
the Crimean people both knowledge of the market and income and 
correspondingly will generate income for the Crimean exchequer 
which, in Saburov's opinion, is almost empty. 
  Will all this not be empty assurances and mere words? 
Definitely not, he believes, recently our people have been 
working more and more on the budget or on programs or else they 
have been selling off every last thing that they have... But 
for an economist (in power) to openly declare that his main task 
is the well-being of the people and not simply to declare it but 
to make every effort to achieve it -- such a thing, in Saburov's 
opinion, has not happened in a long time. 
  The serious economic work which will begin after a detailed 
study of the situation on the spot will be highly specific, 
Saburov believes. Here in the capital he is already making 
promises but immediately seems to restrain himself. "Judge by 
my actions. The Crimea will be open to all -- that is the first 
and the main thing, you will see that for yourself..." 
  [Pavlova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, does the annexation 
[prisoyedineniye] of the Crimea to Russia feature in your plans? 
  [Saburov] This is unreal. After all, you know that it has a 
special status. Furthermore, I do not intend getting into a 
conflict with the motherland or aggravating the Ukrainian 
question. Breaking off ties is a bad thing to do, they must 
only be strengthened!" 
  My last question to Saburov was this: What will one of his 
first economic steps be? The answer was quite unexpected but, I 
think you will agree, interesting -- to create the conditions 
for the activity of banks in the Crimea.

  [Text] Kiev, 22 Feb -- Plenary sessions of the ninth 
session of the Ukrainian Supreme Council have resumed. It was 
proposed that deputies examine 55 issues in four days. On 21 
February, deputies proposed a draft law on the election of 
deputies and heads of rural, village, regional, municipal, and 
oblast councils for the agenda. 
  It was determined that the first issue to be examined on 23 
February will be information from the Cabinet of Ministers on 
the course of implementing the Supreme Council's resolutions on 
the state of the economy in Ukraine, on overcoming the payments 
crisis in the national economy, on the payment of salaries and 
stipends, and on the state of payments for agricultural products. 
  A working group headed by Vasyl Durdynets, the first deputy 
chairman of the Supreme Council, is working on a draft 
resolution on the conformity of laws of the Crimean Republic 
with the Ukrainian Constitution. This issue will be examined at 
the evening session on 24 February along with the participation 
of representatives of the Crimean Republic's power bodies. 
  Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch informed those 
present 
about a speech which Ivan Yemets, head of the Central Election 
Commission, made at a meeting of the Supreme Council Presidium. 
He said that because of the absence of many records, a final 
result of the registration of parliamentary candidates was still 
not available.

  [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent learned on 22 February 
that in connection with the suspension of gas supplies from 
Turkmenistan to Ukraine from 21 February, Yevhen Sukhin, first 
deputy head of the State Committee for Oil and Gas, issued an 
instruction according to which he has obliged Ukraine's 
industrial enterprises to cut gas consumption by a total daily 
amount of 90 million cubic meters (this is equal to amounts of 
gas that Turkmenistan supplied to Ukraine). According to the 
instruction, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of 
Machine-Building and the Ministry of Energy have been 
recommended to draw up by 1000 on 22 February a list of 
enterprises that will have gas consumption restricted or cut. 
UkrBudMaterialy [Ukrainian construction and materials 
committee] and UkrTsement [Ukrainian Cement] have been 
instructed to immediately prepare for production to be 
suspended. The instruction has also been sent to heads of 
oblast state administrations. 
  As a UNIAN correspondent was informed on 22 February by 
UkrGazProm [Ukrainian gas industry committee], as of today the 
State Oil and Gas Committee's instruction had been carried out 
only by Ukraine's Ministry of Energy. 
  In the opinion of a UkrGazProm representative, who wished to 
remain anonymous, unless the situation changed there would only 
be enough gas for 2-3 days. If there is frost, there would be 
restrictions for domestic consumers as well as for industrial 
enterprises. The UNIAN correspondent was told that the 
situation was also being made more complicated because along 
with Turkmenistan, Russia had also suspended gas deliveries to 
Ukraine along the Yelets Dykanka gas pipeline. 
  UkrGazProm also said that if the gas situation in Ukraine 
became more complicated, one would have to illegally take 
Russian gas, which is transported to countries of Western Europe 
through Ukraine. The amounts have not yet been determined but in 
the opinion of an UkrGazProm representative they would be 
between 20-25 million cubic meters daily.

  [Text] Yerevan, February 22 (SNARK) -- Today the details of 
the yesterday's visit of Otar Patsatsia, the Georgian 
prime-minister, to Armenia became known. He has met with Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, the Armenian president, and Grant Bagratyan, the 
prime-minister of Armenia. Today Vahan Papazyan, the foreign 
minister, told reporters about the negotiation. According to 
him Armenia in contrast to Georgia and other CIS's countries 
hasn't got debts for gas supplied by Turkmenistan. 
  The minister said that Armenia is ready to give half of the 
gas purchasing in Turkmenistan to Georgia, however, in return 
for it, Georgia must provide unimpeded passing of loads for 
Armenia through its territory, including the loads from the 
ports of Poti and Batumi. According to Vahan Papazyan, Otar 
Patsatsia wasn't ready to accept the proposals of Armenian 
party. But Vahan Papazyan expressed the hope that after 
appropriate consultations the political authorities of Georgia 
will accept the proposal suggested by Armenia.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] Baku's desire for regional truce follows a 
realization that ways of resolving the Armenian-Azeri conflict 
on the battlefield have been exhausted, a senior Armenian 
official told Interfax. 
  He also pointed to recent military successes by Karabakh 
forces which regained control of the Omar Pass in the Azeri 
region of Kelbajar and to the tough stand taken by Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev during recent talks between the 
Armenian and Azeri defence chiefs. The official said Baku must 
have realized that if Grachev wound up his mediation, "its only 
hope will be a military option which leads nowhere". 
  The Armenian official hopes the agreement will be 
implemented 
in stages. A permanent cease-fire must be followed by troop 
withdrawals, exchange of prisoners and negotiations on the 
status of Nagorno-Karabakh. He said the main thing now was to 
stop the bloodletting because negotiation was a lengthy process. 
  The source expressed regret that the international community 
should proceed from the principle of territorial integrity on 
resolving the conflict. He described it as a superb principle 
unless applied to the Karabakh issue. "This is the internal 
issue of Azerbaijan of which Karabakh used to be part until 
recently but it declared its independence following the 
national-liberation struggle", the source said. Therefore, the 
principle of integrity should not be applied to the disputed 
territory, he said. 
  In the meantime, head of the information and analysis center 
of Armenia's large opposition Dashnaktsutyun Party Bagrat 
Sadoian fears that any cease-fire will only play into the hands 
of Azerbaijan which ran out of its military resources after the 
failure of an offensive it began at the end of December. 
  Sadoian thinks Baku cannot put up with the idea of losing 
Karabakh and is now trying to regain it.

  [Text] Republic's President Geydar Aliyev left for an 
official visit to Great Britain today. Our correspondent 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Akif Mecitoglu] Azerbaijani President 
Geydar Aliyev left for an official visit to Great Britain today 
at the invitation of the British Prime Minister John Major. 
Agreements on political, economic, and cultural cooperation 
will be signed between the two countries. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Esteemed President, the signing 
of a number of economic cooperation agreements between 
Azerbaijan and Great Britain is envisaged. You will also be 
meeting with British businessmen and state officials. What 
effect will such ties have on the development of Azerbaijan's 
economy? 
  [Aliyev] The Azerbaijani president's visit to Great Britain 
is aimed at establishing and developing ties between Azerbaijan 
and Great Britain. This is because, since the attainment of 
independence, Azerbaijan has not yet been able to forge 
interstate ties with a great world power such as Great Britain 
to the degree needed. The British ambassador arrived here only 
a few months ago, and Azerbaijan's ambassador left for Great 
Britain only in recent days. Thus, diplomatic ties are just 
being established. As a young independent state, Azerbaijan is 
in dire need of broad interstate ties, first and foremost 
political and economic ties. The economic ties in themselves 
cover a broad spectrum, ranging from trade to close ties between 
the various British and Azerbaijani business circles to 
scientific and cultural ties. 
  As you know, Britain is one of the major world powers, is 
one 
of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and is 
one of the seven most developed countries. Both in the past and 
at present Britain has been strongly influencing international 
politics and economics. Therefore, the creation of close ties 
between Azerbaijan and Great Britain is first of all exceedingly 
important for the national interest of the Azerbaijani Republic. 
We are also aware that Britain itself is highly interested in 
Azerbaijan. It wants to establish economic ties with 
Azerbaijan. Historically, Britain's interest in the Caucasus 
and Azerbaijan is obvious. In this present stage at the end of 
the 20th century, Britain wants to establish economic ties with 
Azerbaijan on a new foundation. We have already accomplished 
some work in this direction. That is, we have done preparatory 
work. We have to resolve all these matters there. 
  As you know, my visit to Britain is of an official nature. 
This is an official state visit that is taking place at the 
invitation of British Prime Minister John Major. Some days ago 
I received a letter from Mr. John Major in which he says that he 
is looking forward for our meeting and is hopeful that this 
meeting will produce fruitful results for Britain and Azerbaijan. 
  Therefore, I attribute great importance to this visit and 
hope that the British leaders are also giving it great 
importance. Our program there is now clear: There will be 
talks with Prime Minister John Major and we will sign a number 
of agreements with both the prime minister and other officials. 
We will have meetings at the British Parliament and at other 
state departments. Undoubtedly, all these are important matters 
aimed at strengthening our young and independent Azerbaijan's 
foreign policy and its international position. And I am going 
to Britain to resolve these problems.

<F P=106> [Georgiy Bovt report: "Geydar Aliyev's Visit to London. </F>
Azerbaijan President To Consult British "Physicians"] 
  [Text] Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev arrived in 
London on 19 February. The very fact of the visit is not being 
made much of, but the president is known to have spent some two 
days in the British capital. The reason bringing the Azeri 
leader to the shores of misty Albion, the entire press in the 
republic says in one voice, is the desire to "restore his 
health" and "consult English physicians." But even if a visit 
to physicians takes place after all, the real purpose of the 
visit is obviously not that. The Azerbaijan president, one may 
suppose, is to agree on terms of the contract with the 
international oil concern led by British Petroleum 
(KOMMERSANT-DAILY wrote last on its terms on 17 Feb). 
  The republic's press, controlled by the authorities, also 
spill the true aims of Aliyev's trip: Shortly before the visit, 
the newspaper AZARLYK mulled over how successfully Aliyev would 
be able "to play the oil card." Besides, the Great Britain 
visit is a logical continuation of the Turkey voyage 10 days 
earlier. Discussed in Ankara were the terms of the Turkish 
side's participation in the international consortium and the 
route for the projected pipeline along which oil will flow to 
Turkish terminals bypassing Novorossiysk (Russia plans to export 
oil across its own territory). 
  The other problem Aliyev intends to discuss in London is a 
Karabakh settlement. Great Britain has lately been increasingly 
active in this process (given the fact it is not a member of the 
CSCE "Minsk Group" on Nagorno-Karabakh). This is welcomed by 
Baku, which seeks independence from Moscow in this process. 
  Among the delicate questions Aliyev has to solve today is 
foreign assistance for his army, in whose ranks are now fighting 
1,000 Afghan mujahidin and an unknown number of mercenaries from 
neighboring countries. Turkey has provided 300 military 
advisers, some 100 of whom are with the units in the field). 
True, Ankara denies this fact. The advisers are supposed to 
train Azeris in the use of Western military hardware which is 
being supplied through the two main channels -- from Afghanistan 
(via Iran) and from Turkey. Baku has recently bought 50 tanks 
from Kiev. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned from Azeri diplomatic 
sources that the question of sending British military advisers 
to Azerbaijan may also be discussed in London. Those providing 
this information specify, however, that advisers from Great 
Britain would take no part in combat operations and would only 
be doing "teaching work." 
  By internationalizing the situation around the war against 
the Armenians, Aliyev is also solving the problems of 
consolidating his own power. He is balancing between a big 
number of international partners (including Russia) while trying 
to firm up his shaken positions. Today, a whole series of 
regions in the republic (not counting 20 percent of the 
territory occupied by Armenians) are not controlled by the 
president. For example, the sole master of Azerbaijan's west is 
not Aliyev but his "premier rival," Suret Guseynov, who has 
armed formations, outside the national defense forces, including 
armored vehicles. Thus, the Azeri press is quite right: Aliyev 
is off to London to really "restore his health." Political 
health, that is.

  [Text] Azerbaijani Prime Minister Suret Guseynov received 
today the Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and his deputy 
Zorab Kervalishvili. 
  [Begin Sadiq Guzelov recording] Matters of mutual interest 
were discussed at the meeting. Otar Patsatsia requested a 
supply of fuel to Georgia. He also asked for support in 
organizing the visit of Georgian and Azerbaijani experts to Iran 
and the talks there in connection with the supply of the Iranian 
gas to Georgia. An agreement was reached on this issue. 
  The problem of the diversion of a part of the fuel purchased 
from Azerbaijan to Armenia via Georgia was also seriously 
discussed. The Georgian prime minister said that various 
commercial organizations are behind this diversion. Suret 
Guseynov's proposal for Azerbaijani representatives to oversee 
this matter from inside Georgia was accepted. 
  In briefing the guests about the grave situation existing in 
the republic as a result of the six-year-old aggression by 
Armenia, Azerbaijani Prime Minister Suret Guseynov said that 
despite all the difficulties Azerbaijan will not withhold its 
assistance to Georgia, with whom it has lived in friendship for 
centuries. 
  Suret Guseynov also touched upon the problems of our more 
than half a million compatriots living in Georgia, and hoped 
that the Georgian Government will do everything to solve their 
problems. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov and Economy Minister 
Samed Sadykhov also took part in the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Text" of an Foreign Ministry statement on the shooting of </F>
prisoners in Armenia on 15 February; date issued not given--read 
by announcer] 
  [Text] Some 23 Azerbaijani prisoners were shot in a POW 
camp for 300 captives near Spitak in Armenia on 15 February. In 
a statement on 16 February, the Armenian Foreign Ministry 
officially admitted that eight Azerbaijani prisoners were shot 
and killed while attempting to escape. The ministry also said 
that the Armenian Defense Ministry was investigating the 
incident in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and that the 
International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] representative 
in Yerevan had been informed of the situation. 
  The world condemned the criminal practice of establishing 
camps for POW's long ago. The Geneva Conventions adopted in 
1949 called for the safety of war victims. Those Conventions 
banned the inhuman treatment of POW's. 
  Armenia's criminal action not only grossly conflicted with 
the Conventions but also openly violated the accepted norms of 
morality and international law. The Azerbaijani prisoners were 
shot after Azerbaijan revealed that it was prepared to 
unconditionally exchange all the hostages and POW's. 
  Azerbaijan's government organs have unilaterally released 
over 100 Armenian POW's since August 1993 and, in accordance 
with its signing of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Azerbaijan has 
revealed that it condemns the taking of hostages by any side 
during the military operations. Azerbaijan's ruling organs 
repeatedly appealed to their counterparts in Armenia to maintain 
a similar approach to the issue of the Azerbaijani hostages and 
POW's. But the Republic's appeals failed to yield a result. 
  The mistreatment of the innocent war victims reconfirms 
Armenia's involvement in the war against Azerbaijan. Otherwise, 
why should POW camps be established near Gumry, Spitak, 
Echmiadzin, and Gugark in Armenia? Over 3,500 people are 
imprisoned in them, most of them children, women, and elderly 
people. 
  The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry expresses indignation over 
the Armenian ruling organs' fearless activities and describes 
them as inhuman. It calls on the international community, the 
ICRC, and other international and humanitarian organizations to 
investigate all the aspects of Armenia's criminal action.

  [Text] In an interview with Interfax the Deputy Commander 
of Nagorno-Karabakh's defence forces, General Khristofor 
Ivanian, described the attempt to drive a wedge into Karabakh 
defences in Kelbajar District as "a gross blunder on the part of 
the Azeri command." 
  According to him, the Karabakh units holding most of the 
heights there did not find it hard 5 days ago to surround and 
neutralize a large Azeri army group. "The adventure in 
Kelbajar, which pursued largely political goals, turned for 
Azerbaijan into pointless losses; over 500 troops got frozen to 
death high in the mountains," Ivanian said. 
  In the meantime the Karabakh army's arsenal was supplemented 
with trophies: 12 armored vehicles, including five tanks, two 
152-mm self-propelled artillery installations, a jet rocket 
system, heavy guns and other military equipment. According to 
the general, about 20 Azeri servicemen surrendered. The 
Karabakh side lost 3 men; 15 troops were wounded. 
  The general believes that, having failed to score genuine 
success in its two-months-long offensive, Azerbaijan ought to 
get convinced once again that "to use the language of force 
toward the people of Karabakh" is useless.

  [Text] Dushanbe February 22 TASS -- A note of the Tajik 
Foreign Ministry was sent to the Afghan consul in Dushanbe today 
to accuse the Afghan authorities of interference in Tajik 
internal affairs. The note to be passed over to the Afghan 
leaders says the Afghan side violates the bilateral treaty on 
friendship, cooperation and good-neighbourly relations signed in 
December 1993. 
  In the opinion of the Tajik side, the accusations are 
grounded with the assignment of Afghan border territories to 
militants of the Tajik opposition, who systematically shell 
Russian border posts and Tajik villages together with Afghan 
mujaheddin not controlled by the official Kabul authorities. 
  Several populated localities of the border Shuro-Abad region 
in the Tajik south were shelled on February 21 from Afghan 
territory, says the document. A many-hour fighting was imposed 
on the 12th border post of the Moscow border unit by a mixed 
group of Tajik militants and Afghan mujaheddin who infiltrated 
inside Tajikistan. 
  The Tajik government also has information on preparations 
for 
terrorist acts and acts of sabotage in the border Shaartuz, 
Kabodien, Pyandzh and some other regions in the Tajik south. 
  The Tajik side demands that the Afghan leadership take the 
most decisive measures to prevent hostile actions against 
sovereign Tajikistan and the Russian border units, says the 
document. Otherwise, the Tajik government preserves the right to 
stop armed provocations up to destruction of Tajik militants' 
bases on Afghan territory.

on the Afghan leadership to take steps to avert acts of armed 
provocation against sovereign Tajikistan and Russian border 
troops from Afghan territory, the village of Sarigor in 
Tajikistan's south was again shelled on Tuesday night, according 
to sources in the information department of Tajikistan's 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  According to the same source, the Russian border troops 
responded by devastating fire which destroyed a mixed group of 
Tajik opposition militants and Afghan mojahedin near the 12 
border post of the Moscow border unit. The Russian border 
troops are fully in control of the area now. 
  Along with this the source in Tajikistan's Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs cited the command of the Russian border troops 
in Tajikistan as saying that more Tajik opposition militants 
have been observed concentrating near the Afghan city of 
Talukan, province of Tahor, and moving towards the border. The 
source did not rule out the possibility of a new act of armed 
provocation against the Russian border troops in the region.

difficult conditions of the social and political situation, and 
the civil war. The first units of the Armed Forces that were

Tajikistan. I wish you sound health, happiness, and success. I

<F P=106> ["Agreement on Free Trade Between the Republic of Georgia </F>
Government and the Russian Federation Government"] 
  [Text] The Republic of Georgia Government and the Russian 
Federation Government, 
  Aiming to develop commercial and economic cooperation 
between 
the Republic of Georgia and the Russian Federation on the basis 
of equality and mutual benefit, 
  Proceeding from the sovereign right of each of the 
contracting parties to conduct an independent foreign economic 
policy and ensure the fulfillment of corresponding international 
obligations and the realization of intentions that have been 
proclaimed, 
  Intending to promote the creation of a single market in 
goods, services, capital, and workforce, 
  Wishing to promote the creation of the appropriate 
conditions 
for the formation of a customs union between both countries, 
  Have agreed to the following: 
  Article 1 
  1. The contracting parties will not impose customs duties 
and taxes and charges that apply equally to the import and 
export of goods that proceed from the customs territory of one 
of the contracting parties and that are earmarked for delivery 
onto the customs territory of the other contracting party. The 
specific features pertaining to the application of trading 
conditions between both countries on an agreed range of goods 
will be drawn up in annual protocols that form an integral part 
of this agreement. 
  2. For the purposes of this agreement and for the period of 
its validity, goods proceeding from the territory of the 
contracting parties are understood as follows: 
  a) Goods that have been produced in their entirety on the 
territories of the contracting parties; 
  b) Goods that have been produced on the territories of the 
contracting parties, using raw and other materials and assembly 
components originating from third countries, with a change, in 
this case, in their classification, in accordance with the 
Classification of Goods of Foreign Economic Activity (CG FEA) 
based on the EC Coordinated System of Describing and Coding 
Goods and the Combined Tariff and Statistical Register; the 
first four characters must be used in the listing; 
  c) Goods that have been produced with the use of raw 
materials, materials, and assembly components mentioned in Point 
b on condition that their aggregate value does not exceed the 
fixed share of the export price of the saleable goods. 
  Detailed rules on the origins of goods will be drawn up by 
the contracting parties in a separate document that will form an 
integral part of this agreement. 
  Article 2 
  The contracting parties will not: 
  Impose direct or indirect internal taxes or charges on goods 
covered by this agreement that exceed the corresponding taxes or 
charges that are imposed on similar home-produced goods or goods 
originating from third countries; 
  Introduce, in respect of the import and/or export of goods 
covered by this agreement, any special restrictions and demands 
that, in a similar situation, are not being applied to similar 
home-produced goods or goods originating from third countries; 
  Apply rules, in respect of the warehousing, transshipment, 
storage, and carriage of goods originating from the other 
contracting party and also payments and the transfer of 
payments, other than those that are being applied in similar 
instances regarding one's own goods or goods originating from 
third countries. 
  Article 3 
  1. The contracting parties will refrain from imposing 
quantitative restrictions or equivalent measures on the export 
and/or import of goods within the framework of this agreement. 
  2. The quantitative restrictions mentioned in Point 1 of 
this article may be established by one side within reasonable 
limits and for a strictly defined period of time only: 
  When there is an acute shortage of the given goods on the 
internal market -- until the situation on the market is 
stabilized; 
  When there is an acute deficit in the balance of payments -- 
until the situation with the balance of payments is stabilized; 
  If any types of goods are imported onto the territory of one 
of the contracting parties in such increased quantities or under 
such conditions that harm or threaten to harm home producers of 
similar or directly competing goods; 
  In order to implement the measures stipulated in Article 4 
of 
this agreement. 
  3. The quantitative restrictions mentioned in Point 1 of 
this article may also be established on the mutual agreement of 
the sides and be included in the annual protocols mentioned in 
Article 1 of this agreement. 
  4. The contracting side applying the quantitative 
restrictions in accordance with Point 2 of this article, at the 
request of the other contracting side, will supply the necessary 
information on the reasons for introducing the restrictions 
mentioned, their forms, and possible periods of duration. 
  5. The contracting sides will aim to resolve by means of 
consultations all questions arising in connection with the 
application of the quantitative restrictions mentioned in Point 
2 of this article. 
  Article 4 
  Each of the contracting parties will not permit the reexport 
of goods on whose export the other contracting party from whose 
territory these goods originate is applying measures of tariff 
and/or non-tariff regulation. 
  The parties will exchange lists of goods on which measures 
of 
tariff and/or non-tariff regulation are being applied. 
  Such goods can be reexported to third countries only on 
written consent and under conditions defined by the authorized 
state body that is the country of origin of these goods. In the 
event that this clause is not implemented, the contracting party 
whose interests have been violated has the right to introduce 
measures against the other side to regulate the export of goods 
onto the territory of the contracting party that has permitted 
the unsanctioned reexport. At the same time, the currency 
earnings from such reexport are to be returned to the country 
from where the corresponding goods originated. 
  Each year, the contracting parties will additionally agree 
upon the conditions, range, and volume of goods permitted for 
reexport. 
  For the purposes of this article, reexport means the removal 
of goods originating from the customs territory of one of the 
contracting parties by the other contracting party beyond the 
limits of the latter's customs territory with the aim of 
exporting them to a third country. 
  Article 5 
  The contracting parties will exchange information on a 
regular basis on customs questions, including customs 
statistics. Bodies authorized by the contracting parties will 
draw up the procedure for the exchange of such information in a 
corresponding document. 
  Article 6 
  The contracting parties will undertake measures aimed at 
drawing together the levels of customs duty rates that are being 
applied in trade with third countries and, to this end, will 
hold regular consultations. 
  The contracting parties will inform one another about all 
exceptions regarding customs tariffs in force in their states. 
  Article 7 
  The contracting parties, in accordance with current 
legislation on their territories, will promote the expansion and 
deepening of equal and mutually advantageous economic and 
scientific and technological cooperation between economic 
subjects at all levels and forms of ownership and the creation 
of joint enterprises and international companies, involving also 
the participation of third countries, with the aim of utilizing 
their potentials in order to form an effective common economic 
space. 
  Article 8 
  The contracting parties recognize as incompatible with the 
aims of this agreement unfair business practice expressed, in 
particular, in the following: 
  In the conclusion of contracts between enterprises whose aim 
is to hinder or restrict competition or violate the conditions 
for it on the territories of the contracting parties; 
  In the carrying out of actions with whose help one or 
several 
enterprises use their position of dominance, restricting 
competition on all or a significant part of the territories of 
the contracting parties. 
  Article 9 
  The contracting parties will not use state aid in the form 
of 
subsidies to enterprises or in any other form if such state aid 
should result in the violation of normal economic conditions on 
the territory of the other contracting party. 
  Article 10 
  During the implementation of measures aimed at the tariff 
and 
non-tariff regulation of bilateral economic relations, in order 
to exchange statistical information and conduct customs 
procedures, the contracting parties have agreed to use the 
single nine-character Classification of Goods of Foreign 
Economic Activity (CG FEA) based on the Coordinated System of 
Describing and Coding Goods. At the same time, for the own 
needs of their states, the contracting parties, when necessary, 
will develop the classification of goods beyond nine characters. 
  The Russian Federation will introduce a standard copy of the 
classification of goods through its representations in the 
corresponding international organizations till such time as the 
Republic of Georgia announces that it is independently 
introducing such a copy. 
  Article 11 
  The contracting parties agree that the observance of the 
principle of free transit is a most important condition for 
achieving the aims of this agreement and an essential element in 
the process of their inclusion in the system of the 
international division of labor and collaboration. 
  In this respect, each of the contracting parties guarantees 
the unhindered transit through its territory of goods that 
originate from the customs territory of the other contracting 
party and/or third countries and that are earmarked for the 
customs territory of the other contracting party or any third 
country; they will offer exporters and importers all the 
available means and services necessary for ensuring transit 
under conditions that are no worse than those under which the 
same means and services are offered to their own exporters and 
importers or to exporters and importers from a third state. 
  The contracting parties will not demand payment for services 
connected with the warehousing, transshipment, storage, and 
carriage of goods in the currency of any third state. 
  Article 12

  [Text] Gas supplies to Georgia from Turkmenistan will 
continue in the coming days. An understanding was reached 
Monday during telephone talks between President Saparmurad 
Niyazov of Turkmenistan and the Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze, a spokesman for the Georgian leader has informed 
Interfax. 
  The spokesman said that Georgian Prime Minister Otar 
Patsatsiya is expected to visit Ashgabat this week to continue 
the talks on postponement of the Georgian gas-supply debt to 
Turkmenistan. 
  By different estimates the debt amounts to $100-400 Mn. 
  Meanwhile, the energy crisis in Georgia has reached a peak. 
For two days, the republic was only supplied with a minimal of 
electric energy owing to the accident at the Tbilisi 
hydro-electric station. Metro, TV and radio stations did not 
work in Tbilisi. There is no water supply in Tbilisi homes. 
Telephones are on the blink. 
  The leader of the Georgian Energy Department Yuriy Chediya 
has told Interfax that the Tbilisi hydro-electric station has 
been repaired and supplies energy once again. The spokesman 
said that the situation would be critical if gas supplies were 
cut.

  [Text] Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs paid a 
one-day visit to Belarus on 21 February. In the morning, he 
held talks with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, as 
a result of which eight documents were signed. As BELAPAN 
learned, the documents concern, first of all, the state border 
between the two countries. The border is to remain the same as 
it was on 16 June 1940. During the talks, both sides agreed 
that it is necessary to expand cooperation between the two 
countries in various spheres of economy and politics. They 
particularly expressed their willingness to reach an agreement 
on mutually beneficial utilization of the Navapolatsk refinery 
and the Ventspils seaport. Also discussed was the possibility 
of establishing department stores in the capitals of both 
republics. Latvian products will be displayed, for example, by 
the Minsk supermarket Ryha. The situation of Belarusians in 
Latvia was also discussed at the meeting.

  [Text] At their meeting in Minsk on Monday the prime 
ministers of Belarus and Latvia signed a package of documents 
concerning the essential issues in their bilateral relations. 
  These include a treaty on legal aid, accords on ecological 
problems and on the transit of special cargoes through Latvia, 
and a trade agreement for 1994. In addition, Vyacheslav Kebich 
and Valdis Birkavs signed a document on forming commissions 
designed to demarcate the border between the two countries and 
ease the rules for its crossing for those who live in the border 
areas. 
  As Prime Minister Kebich said at the news conference given 
after the meeting, the document on the transit of special 
cargoes through Latvia "is very useful for Belarus," since it 
grants Minsk the opportunity to transport through Latvia its 
weapons exported to different countries. 
  According to Kebich, the document also makes it easier to 
resolve problems connected with oil imports from the United Arab 
Emirates and other countries in the Middle East. "Belarus will 
buy the oil which is cheaper," the prime minister stressed. In 
his view, Belarus should not get tied to the Friendship oil 
pipeline. 
  Prime Minister Birkavs told the news conference that ethnic 
Belarusians living in Latvia will be guaranteed all human 
rights, even though dual citizenship will not be introduced in 
his country.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>
  [Text] The session began, as usual, with people's 
deputies' speeches delivered during the miscellaneous section. 
In general, the floor was taken by members of the parliamentary 
opposition -- Syamdzyanava, Novik, Dzeyka, Navumchyk, and 
Holubew. They sharply criticized the current political 
situation in the republic. Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw 
Hryb reported that the Supreme Soviet Presidium had received 
proposals to include certain other issues on the agenda. For 
example, draft legislation on archives, which was proposed by 
People's Deputy Aleh Trusaw, was included on the agenda. The 
issue of science and technical activities, on the other hand, 
did not receive the required number of votes and was not 
included on the agenda, as well as certain other issues. 
People's Deputy Ihar Demyanchuk approached the microphone and 
proposed to include on the agenda the issue of violating human 
rights in the Republic of Belarus. However, the issue was not 
included, because only 66 people's deputies supported this. 
Belarusian Attorney General Vasyl Shaladonaw came forward with 
a proposal to strip People's Deputy Syarhey Antonchyk of 
parliamentary immunity and bring him to administrative account. 
One hundred eighty eight people's deputies voted to include 
this issue on the agenda. Therefore, the issue will be 
addressed at the current session. People's Deputy Uladzimir 
Novik suggested that the financial credit policy of the Republic 
of Belarus be discussed first. This was the course of the 
morning session. During the recess, I held an interview with 
People's Deputy Inesa Mikhaylovna Drabyshewskaya. 
  [Begin recording] [Rutkowski] It was not a coincidence that 
the issue of implementing the Chernobyl program was also 
excluded. Inessa Mikhaylovna, what is your opinion on the 
attitude of people's deputies toward resolving problems of 
Chernobyl? 
  [Drabyshewskaya, in Russian] I was really dumbfounded when 
they excluded the debate on implementing the Chernobyl program, 
because I live in the Chernobyl zone, and I was elected to serve 
as an advocate for this program. We know that the aftermath of 
the Chernobyl disaster is evident in our oblast, with regard to 
the rate of diseases among adults and children, the 
deterioration of people's immune systems, and the rate of birth 
defects. The number of cases of oncological diseases increased 
by 6 percent last year, including among children. 
  [Rutkowski] What, in your opinion, are the reasons behind 
this specific attitude of people's deputies toward the Chernobyl 
problems? 
  [Drabyshewskaya] The Chernobyl problem is one of the most 
important economic problems. There is no money to implement 
this program. [Words indistinct] another, strictly political 
issue. The legislative body violated the law, having 
misinterpreted it. 
  [Rutkowski] Do you have in mind Syarhey Antonchyk? 
  [Drabyshewskaya] In this case this concerns Antonchyk, 
Drabyshewskaya, Kamay, and all people's deputies. This become a 
precedent. This precedent should be discussed by the 
legislative body according to a law that is called the rules. 
[end recording] 
  Now, I am talking with People's Deputy Stanislav 
Stanislavovich Shushkevich [former Supreme Soviet Chairman]. 
  [Begin recording] [Rutkowski] Stanislav Stanislavovich, with 
what opinions and feelings did you come to today's session, and 
what is your assessment on the political situation in the 
Republic? 
  [Shushkevich] I came to the session to work. The point is 
whether we will discuss economic issues. I do not know if we 
are going to address them first. If these issues are not 
discussed, other things will not have any sense. Let us say 
frankly that the government is unable to manage the state, and 
that its goal is to give up our state to Russia under any 
conditions. We must resist this, because there are enough 
people in Belarus who are able to lead the state, and we must 
make room for them. The elections must be held. I believe that 
it is a felony to delay the elections until November. [end 
recording] 
  At the end of my report I will add that people are gathering 
at Independence Square and in front of the House of Government.

  [Text] [Lyudmila Vilyuga] Today a continuation of the rally 
and strike started on 15 February at the initiative of the 
republican strike committee, the independent trade union and the 
Belarus People's Front, was expected in Independence Square in 
Minsk. The rally, which numbered about 1,500 people, however, 
did not turn into a large-scale event. It demanded that the 
government should resign, the parliament be dissolved and new 
elections to the Supreme Soviet be held. Incidentally, the last 
demand coincides with a demand put forward by the republican 
federation of trade unions. 
  Meanwhile, the people's deputies who met today after a break 
in the session were in no hurry to heed the voice of the people. 
They started with discussing the agenda. Today Stanislav 
Shushkevich, ex-chairman of the parliament, turned up in 
parliament for the first time since his resignation. Now he can 
appraise the Supreme Soviet's work under a different angle. 
  [Begin Shushkevich recording] The parliament does not want 
to 
heed the views of the minority. Its overwhelming majority is 
made up of old Communists elected when the Belarus Communist 
Party was in power. [end recording] 
  [Vilyuga] The parliamentary majority solved cadre issues 
quite efficiently today. Three generals took important offices: 
Uladimir Danko was appointed interior minister, Genadz Lavitski 
-- chairman of the KGB, and (Anatoliy Novikov) -- chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet's commission for national security and 
combating crime. Ivan Bambiza was elected new deputy chairman 
of the Supreme Soviet.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatol Hatowchyts: "One Should Not Deceive </F>
People..."] 
  [Text] No politician has recently attracted more attention 
of Homel Oblast residents than Stanislav Shushkevich, the former 
Supreme Soviet chairman. Invited by the City Council of the 
"Vyasna `94" Association [Spring], the former legislative 
speaker visited Homel and had three meetings here -- with 
activists of democratic parties and movements, with "Homselmash" 
plant workers, and with broad circles of the public. 
  The meetings evoked so much interest that the audience 
spilled from the room over to the hallways. By the way, Mr. 
Shushkevich did not come all by himself. He was accompanied by 
the deputy from Homel Aleskandr Sasnow, head of the legislative 
standing commission, and Aleksandr Dabravolski, leader of the 
United Democratic Party of Belarus. 
  It stands to reason that the current political and economic 
situation of Belarus was the focus of their attention. It is 
worsening, and people should not be deceived about this. 
Meanwhile, the old Constitution, after its Article 6 about the 
leading role of the Communist Party has been removed, specifies 
no one to control operations of the government. It has been 
three years since the Kebich government went from one extreme to 
another -- to no effect, though. It even does not allow "its 
own" newspapers to criticize it. This is easy to explain -- it 
is not capable of governing, it can only execute someone else's 
instructions. 
  To corroborate his point, Stanislav Shushkevich brought up 
three facts. Although Belarus declared its sovereignty, it now 
faces the question of abandoning it. Although a market 
transition program was adopted some time ago, it is practically 
dead now. Was the government brought to account for those 
failures? Of course, not. By giving good positions to many 
deputies, titles, and convenient land plots for houses, the 
Kebich government formed a virtually unsinkable pro-government 
lobby in the Supreme Soviet from the old nomenklatura. This 
lobby drags its feet on adopting a new constitution and many 
other things. 
  In this situation, S. Shushkevich thinks that the democratic 
parties and movements should rally around the idea of building 
Belarusian sovereignty, democracy, market economy, and force the 
Supreme Soviet to keep to its declaration on calling early 
elections this spring. This will enable a whole range of urgent 
problems, including that of the government, to be resolved as 
soon as possible. In the opinion of Stanislav Shushkevich, 
people can determine on their own who to vote for and whom to 
entrust with their lives over the next five years. 
  It was the demand for immediate legislative elections that 
moved Mr. Shushkevich closer to the "Vyasna `94" bloc, even 
though the former speaker has no intention so far of joining any 
particular party. Also, his answers show that he does not 
intend to establish his own party, either. So, this man will 
probably play a coordinating role in the democratic camp, which 
no one has played well so far. This is why Stanislav 
Shushkevich once said that he mastered another profession over 
the past three years -- that of a politician. He proved that in 
Homel -- and not only through a deep and comprehensive 
understanding of the situation and witty answers that now and 
then made the audience burst into applause. The most important 
thing is that he does not look defeated. During one meeting, he 
artistically brought to nothing attempts by several dozens of 
political hacks to obstruct the dialog. 
  I believe that many from the audience felt and realized that 
it is too early for Shushkevich to leave big politics. And as 
many, it turned out, are ready to give their votes to that 
politician with high integrity. Ridiculous accusations of 
misconduct just would not stick to him. 
  P.S. As we have just learned, Stanislav Shushkevich was 
invited to visit Baranovichi, Borisov, Orsha, and other cities 
of the Republic.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 19/2/1994 -- During Moldovan 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs delegation's visit to Poland, the 
treaty on friendship and cooperation was elaborated. The treaty 
will be signed with the occasion of President Snegur's visit to 
Poland, scheduled for April-May 1994, stated today in a press 
conference Ion Botnaru, minister ad-interim of foreign affairs. 
The protocol on consultation between the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs of the two states was also signed in Warsaw. Moldovan 
delegation elaborated a series of documents among which the 
agreement on avoiding double taxation and on protecting foreign 
investments; the documents will be signed in April-May, 1994. 
The possibility for intensifying economic relations between 
Moldova and West Europe was analyzed during the delegation's 
meetings with Warsaw officials. The opening of Moldovan Embassy 
in Poland in the first half of 1994 was also discussed. Polish 
side expressed its availability to cooperate with Moldova 
especially in commercial and economic spheres. Poland is 
interested in importing Moldovan wine, champagne and cognac for 
hard currency. Botnaru said the Dniester problem was touched 
during the discussions. He emphasized that Dniester should be 
granted a special status. "We have to find solutions that will 
undermine Tiraspol leaders' position and will attract the masses 
on our side," said Botnaru. Concerning the entitlement of 
Aurelian Danila, presently Moldovan Ambassador in Bucharest, as 
Moldovan Ambassador in Vienna, Botnaru said that he would like 
to see in Austria "a professional who knows two foreign 
languages and the multilateral diplomacy." "We are in the 
search of an Ambassador for Bucharest and we would like our 
second ambassador in Bucharest to do much more for transforming 
the agency of meetings and parties in a real embassy that would 
deal with Romanian-Moldovan relations," said Botnaru.

<F P=106> [From 23 Febraury HOMMIKULEHT, PAEVALEHT, RAHVA HAAL, </F>
POSTIMEES, pp 1,3; "News Bulletin" No. 37/94] 
  [Text] Wednesday, February 23 -- President Lennart Meri 
called a special meeting of Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Interior 
Minister Heiki Arike and Defence Forces Commander in Chief 
General Aleksander Einseln yesterday to discuss the incident at 
the Amari airfield. The Defence Ministry failed to ascertain the 
location of Defence Minister Indrek Kannik, the presidential 
chancellery press release added. 
  The meeting discussed the incident and the "unacceptable 
inefficiency" of the information services to relay information 
directly concerning Estonia's security and international 
reputation, the press release read. 
  President Meri received Russian charge d'affaires Anatoliy 
Ivanov yesterday, who relayed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
congratulations in connection with Estonia's national holiday. 
The president assured the Russian representative that a 
thorough investigation will be carried out and the guilty 
persons will be punished. 
  Russian Charge d'Affaires Ivanov also met the head of the 
Foreign Ministry political section Toivo Klaar, who expressed 
his regret with Russia linking the incident to Estonia's 
official policy and also criticised Russia's reaction to the 
picketing of its naval HQ in Tallinn on Monday [21 February]. 
High Russian officials had described it as an inflammatory 
action, leading to provocations like the incident in Amari. But 
head of the Russian Foreign Ministry information section 
Grigoriy Karasin stressed that the incident is not seen as a 
political one. Still, he described it as a provocation. 
  The Interior Ministry considers a personal vendetta the most 
likely version. The ministry press release expressed suspicions 
that persons connected with the Russian Army unit may be 
involved. Amari has been mentioned as a gateway for illegal 
immigrants to Estonia and for the removal of stolen property to 
Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 22, BNS -- Alleging that Monday [21 
February] night's attack against a guardhouse at the gates of 
the Russian air base of Amari in Estonia was an indication of 
the Estonian authorities' overall attitude toward the Russian 
troops, an aide to Russian President Boris Yeltsin today said 
the attack was another episode to reflect this attitude recently. 
  Dmitri Ryurikov, the presidential aide, in an interview with 
BNS said similar "provocations" had taken place on several 
occasions and that such action "would hardly contribute to 
progress in the negotiations" between the two countries. 
  Referring to an incident last month in Latvia, when a 
regional leader ordered two Russian generals detained and sent 
out of the country, Ryurikov called the sequence of events a 
"rather coordinated policy" of the Baltic countries. 
  He said the events were viewed by Russia as "regrettable." 
In 
his words Russia, having done "quite a lot" for the Baltics 
becoming sovereign and independent countries, "has the right to 
count on a definitely different attitude." "Russia hopes that no 
such episodes will occur in the future," he said. 
  Ryurikov said there was going to be no reaction to the 
incident from President Yeltsin. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday delivered a protest 
to 
Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn. "It is difficult to say how much 
effect such protests will have on the hotheads, on extremists, 
but one would like to trust that the authorities will implement 
measures to protect the Russian military units," the 
presidential aide said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 22, BNS -- The head of political 
department at the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Toivo Klaar, met 
with Russia's Charge d'Affaires Anatoli Ivanov in Tallinn today 
to discuss the incident that took place at the gates of a 
Russian-held air base in northwestern Estonia in early hours on 
Monday [21 February]. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry departmental head expressed 
the 
country's regret at what had happened and said the Estonian 
authorities will do everything to find out those guilty in the 
incident. The regional police of the local Harjumaa country is 
conducting the investigation, he said. 
  Klaar spoke about the initial results of the investigation. 
  But he also said Estonia considered it inadmissible that 
Russia in its recent statements has presented the incident as 
standing in connection with Estonia's official policy, the 
Estonian Foreign Ministry press office reports. 
  Klaar said that Russian troops staying in Estonia against 
the 
will of the Estonian people are a source of potential risk. 
  He expressed bewilderment over the position voiced Monday by 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krolov, who sharply 
denounced the pickets that took place in front of the Russian 
naval garrison headquarters in Tallinn. 
  Klaar said Estonia as a democratic country was guaranteeing 
the freedom of expression for its people, and that it is the 
freedom of parliament members to take part in such pickets. He 
was referring to Russia's protests over a deputy speaker of the 
Estonian parliament and the former foreign minister having taken 
part in picketing. 
  The statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry followed after 
Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn had been called to the ministry in 
Moscow Monday to be delivered Russia's protest on the attack 
against guards in the gatehouse of the Amari air base, Estonia. 
  Five armed men had attacked the guardhouse, allegedly 
searching for weapons and ordering a Russian officer and a 
sergeant to lie on the ground outside. The attackers drove away 
in their car after setting the house on fire. 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krolov turned over to 
the Estonian ambassador the protest, calling the incident a 
provocation and an "extremely dangerous, purposeful action that 
may lead to consequences difficult to predict." 
  In the words of another senior official at the Russian 
ministry, Sergei Prikhodko, Russia demanded from Estonia 
"exhaustive explanations and punishment of the authors of and 
participants in the provocation." 
  At the same time the pickets in front of the Russian naval 
headquarters in Tallinn were termed by the official an action of 
incitement. "It is namely such actions that fuel reciprocal 
hostility and serve as ground for provocations like the one that 
occurred at Amari," the diplomat said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 22, BNS -- Russia announced today it 
will begin preparatory work to mark down the current borderline, 
what it declares the official border with Estonia. 
  Estonia, sticking to the border as established by the 1920 
Tartu peace treaty, has turned down any suggestions so far to 
give the current borderline a formal status. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry and other departments involved 
in the work have started to draw up the respective documents, 
Sergei Prikhodko, head of the Bureau for the Baltics at the 2nd 
European department at the Foreign Ministry told reporters at a 
briefing in Moscow. 
  He said a situation when no clearly marked border exists in 
reality couldn't last forever. 
  The diplomat said Russia was forced to start marking the 
border unilaterally, as Estonia was not prepared to do it 
together. 
  He said a situation had emerged on the Estonian-Russian 
border that could lead to "severe consequences," adding that 
this was due to Estonia's attempts to "resurrect the 1920 Tartu 
Peace Treaty." 
  Expressing Russia's concern about frequent occasions of 
illegal border crossing and what he called "agitation carried 
out by Estonian emissaries" on the territories that were once 
part of Estonia, he said appeals to residents in those areas to 
take Estonian citizenship and get Estonian passports were "in 
violation of the Russian legislation." 
  At the same time Russia allows its citizens to have dual 
citizenship, a status that Estonian laws forbid. 
  Estonia in its official policy insists that the 1920 Tartu 
Peace Treaty remains in force and, thus, Estonia has the legal 
right for territories now formally part of Russia's Leningrad 
and Pskov regions, which went to Russia in the 1940's and 1950's. 
  Also the Estonian Constitution defines the country's borders 
as valid before the Soviet invasion of 1940. 
  Russia regards the peace treaty as having lost its validity.

  [Text] Tallinn, February 21 -- Tallinn City Court ruled 
against MP Juri Toomepuu in a lawsuit against Estonian Prime 
Minister Mart Laar and the State Chancellery over the 
controversial Israeli arms deal, concluded in January 1993 
between the Estonian government and Israeli TAAS company, judge 
Viljo Viilol told ETA, on Monday [21 February]. 
  Juri Toomepuu accused Mart Laar and the State Chancellery of 
concluding a "harmful and illegal", both towards him and the 
Estonian state, arms deal with the TAAS Israel Industries 
company and in willfully presenting wrong data. Toomepuu 
applied for compensation of "financial and moral harm" done to 
him, correspondingly 1075,86 kroons and 10 million kroons. 
  After the Riigikogu adopted the ratifying law of the arms 
deal on December 15 last year, it made the agreement lawful 
starting January 7, 1993, when it was signed, Viilol said. 
President Lennart Meri ratified the law at the end of December 
last year. 
  Thus, Toomepuu's accusations that those that signed the 
agreement had broken the Constitution and that the deal was 
unfavourable and economically disadvantageous to Estonia, 
causing him financial harm, were unfounded, Viilol stated. 
  Toomepuu has to pay 15,340 kroons to barrister Urmas Arumae 
for representing the State Chancellery. Toomepuu has the right 
to appeal to Tallinn district court in ten days.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 22, BNS -- A representative of TAAS 
Israel Industries Ltd., visiting Estonia over alleged failure of 
a part of the companys' arms consignment to measure up to 
provisions of the arms purchase agreement, said TAAS will 
unconditionally and on its own expense do away with all 
shortcomings in the shipment. 
  The Estonian side at today's talks presented its claims and 
proposals concerning the shortcomings uncovered by experts at 
the Estonian armed forces' Central Staff, a spokesman for the 
Defense Ministry said. 
  Issues over which the parties might remain diverse will be 
settled after additional expert examination, he said. 
  In order to avoid discrepancies in the future, Estonian 
representatives will inspect the weapons as to their 
completeness when the next consignments will be put together in 
Israel, the meeting decided. 
  Soviet-made trophy weapons received by Estonia as a gift 
from 
TAAS, which have caused most of the protests by Estonian as to 
their usability, are to be assessed by a commission of 
independent experts in the near future, the defense ministry 
spokesman said. 
  The Soviet-made ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns, which arrived in 
Estonia in shipments on Jan. 23 and Feb. 4, were found 
substandard by Estonian experts in a report turned in Feb. 16. 
The weapons were a gift from TAAS Israel Industries Ltd. to 
Estonia. This was also confirmed in a letter by the company's 
Vice President Razi Dotan from Jan. 27. 
  The Estonian defense forces' Central Staff in its Feb. 17 
report on expert examination pointed out shortcomings in the 
supplies of additional equipment when compared to the provisions 
of the agreement signed between Estonia and the Israeli company. 
In abidance by the stipulations of the agreement, the Defense 
Ministry on the same day notified the Israeli company of the 
shortcomings discovered. 
  The Estonian parliament's State Defense Commission in a 
statement on Feb. 17 said the Israeli state company had 
violated the arms purchase agreement with Estonia.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 22, ELTA -- After NATO had threatened 
Bosnia with air strikes, heavy weapons were withdrawn from 
Sarajevo. The efforts of United Nations, NATO, international 
organizations and the biggest countries to eliminate the Bosnian 
conflict produced the results. We support the idea of passing 
Sarajevo's administration to United Nations and expansion of the 
peace zones in other parts of Bosnia. 
  Although Lithuania is separated from Bosnia by more than a 
thousand kilometres, we are not indifferent to the senseless 
massacre in Europe. Unfortunately, in some other European 
countries the situation is not stable as well, so similar 
conflicts should be prevented beforehand. 
  Lithuania is interested in peaceful, but determined and more 
coordinated actions of the international community in regulating 
the conflict in Bosnia.

  [Text] Nikolay Obertyshev, Russian ambassador in Vilnius, 
was summoned today by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys 
concerning the illegal transit of military equipment through the 
territory of Lithuania. 
  As has been reported, a Russian train with 26 military 
armored vehicles aboard crossed the territory of Lithuania last 
weekend without informing the border guards in advance. The 
vehicles were accompanied by armed Russian servicemen who did 
not have the obligatory permission from the Lithuanian Ministry 
of Interior Affairs to transport weapons. 
  Minister Povilas Gylys voiced his concern to the Russian 
ambassador concerning the incident and asked Russia to observe 
the transit regulations in future. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska told the Baltic News 
Service correspondent that similar incidents could have a 
negative impact on the possibility of signing an agreement with 
Russia on its military transit through Lithuania. Events like 
this do not prove that Russia would observe the agreement, he 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian National Defense Minister Linas </F>
Linkevicius by TIESA chief editor Domas Sniukas in Vilnius; date 
not given: "Some People Are Serving, While Others Are Trading"] 
  [Text] [Sniukas] Although the "Partnership for Peace" 
document, signed with NATO by President Algirdas Brazauskas on 
27 January in Brussels, has already been discussed in public, I 
would suggest that we begin our conversation from this issue. 
  Society, the ruling force, and the opposition accepted this 
historical fact favorably but with no joy. 
  There are, probably, many reasons. Although boasting of this 
event as its accomplishment, the opposition did not feel 
overjoyed because the official move was made by their political 
rivals. In general, the ruling force does not like commotion. 
There have also been some doubts: Would it not have been 
better to remain neutral? Would not this political move, which 
does not yet have any definite security outlines, cost us too 
much? 
  How does the Lithuanian National Defense Ministry assess 
this 
act? 
  [Linkevicius] First of all, our ministry rates it as a clear 
and definite decision to look for collective security guarantees 
in the West. This was no sensation to me or, I think, many 
Lithuanian people. Despite the constant intimidations from the 
opposition's propagandists that the Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party [LDDP] is steering Lithuania toward the East, the 
country's integration with European economic, political, and, 
finally, military structures is consistent, and we were not the 
last to make just another step. I will remind everyone that 
ours was the first state among the former Soviet Union republics 
to be admitted to the European Council. It was also the first 
one from which the Russian Army withdrew. We fell short of 
being the first in Brussels -- only Romania outstripped us "in 
the bend." 
  Certainly, the signing of the Partnership program does not 
yet change anything the next day. We are only drafting the 
concept. This is by no means NATO membership with guaranteed 
military assistance in the event of aggression. 
  It is only clear that this agreement will bring us closer to 
NATO and Western Europe, and will require a qualitative 
transformation of the armed forces. 
  First of all, our military facilities and ammunition will 
have to be revamped according to NATO standards. The same 
applies to the training of servicemen and officers and the 
functioning of the national defense system. 
  Not everything is new here to us. We have already 
accomplished something, we have had joint military exercises and 
so on with the Latvian and Estonian Defense Ministries. 
  We will also train jointly a Baltic military formation that 
could be used under the U.N. colors. 
  [Sniukas] The president has stated that our partnership with 
NATO is a process.... 
  [Linkevicius] This process has already begun. A working 
group headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska has been 
set up at the government. The Danish and German ambassadors to 
NATO have already visited Lithuania. Integration moves are 
being discussed operatively. An officers' group is undergoing a 
training course in Denmark. British specialists have proposed 
serious assistance in military training. Sweden has offered the 
Baltic states considerable assistance in forming the 
international military corps. 
  I am not saying that this will cost Lithuania nothing. Yes, 
it will! Maybe, very much. However, how could one assess our 
security, independence, and our economic and cultural condition 
after 50 years of dependence.... 
  A conference of Nordic defense ministers will be held in 
Visby in summer which will be attended by Baltic representatives 
as well. It is there that the assistance plans will be 
specified. 
  [Sniukas] The Moscow press has reported that quite a number 
of jokes are circulating at the Russian General Staff concerning 
the Baltic states' armored bicycles, the "corn" [reference to 
outdated light planes suitable for spraying corn fields rather 
than fighting] air force, and fishing boats armed with 
machine-guns. Foreign countries are said to propose trash to the 
Baltic states which pay much for it without consideration. This 
is how Western "assistance" is presented. 
  [Linkevicius] Certainly, the military of the country in 
which 
imperialist feelings are still alive and the nuclear weapons of 
which can wipe out if not the entire world then at least its 
half, can mock the first steps of our Defense Ministry. I would 
not agree, however, that Russian soldiers are morally superior 
to Lithuanian ones. 
  Every beginning is difficult. Mistakes are made, pilferers 
take advantage of the situation, and there is much disorder. I 
do not doubt, however, that Lithuania will be proud of its Army 
shortly, while the latter will be able not only to march but 
also will not repeat the mistakes of 1940 which were actually 
dictated by politicians. 
  [Sniukas] Russian jokes are supplemented by the constant 
criticism, particularly of the arms purchase, in the Lithuanian 
press. The press does not doubt that this was a crime, but it 
is uncertain whether anyone will be punished. 
  [Linkevicius] One should not expect a Solomonic reply. I 
think that we should distinguish at least two stages in the arms 
purchase. 
  The first one would relatively include the years 1990-1991 
when we did not yet have the international recognition, when 
each day and hour were full of dangers, and when the National 
Defense Department was only emerging. Let us remember the years 
1918-1920 when the Lithuanian Army bought arms from German 
soldiers for money, fat, and vodka. The recent situation was 
also similar. 
  Certainly, the deals of the recent months must be legally 
and 
financially justified. 
  I can tell the public that the Defense Ministry leadership 
will not defend the honor of the regiment. However, it will 
observe the presumption of innocence until the court judgment. 
We have reached an agreement on job cooperation with the State 
Inspection Department and the Prosecutor General's Office. I 
think that we will learn the truth not only about the arms 
purchase but also about other deals. 
  [Sniukas] Listening to the statements by Defense Ministry 
officials about officers' low wages and poor conditions in 
units, the community may wonder whether our Army is not overly 
large. We would not resist the big neighbors even if we 
increased the soldiers' number tenfold. Should we rather 
improve its quality? 
  [Linkevicius] I think that this question should be addressed 
to our politicians. It is not the National Defense Ministry 
that defines the number of armed forces. Do not forget its 
majesty, the budget, and the finances specially assigned to 
national defense. 
  To be aware of the exact number of servicemen, the Seimas 
[parliament] should announce a military doctrine. The latter, 
in turn, cannot be drafted without a security concept. 
Unfortunately, our Seimas men and women have not yet discussed 
this issue. 
  [Sniukas] We have signed the "Partnership for Peace" program 
with NATO. However, it is difficult to predict any definite 
benefit except the political one. Meanwhile, Russia surely did 
not like this move. The community is considering now: Has our 
security improved or weakened after this? 
  [Linkevicius] We have not heard any statements from Russian 
officials after 27 January that are cause for concern. 
  First, this agreement is not directed against other 
countries. 
  Second, I think that leaders of the United States and other 
countries have fully explained the essence of this agreement to 
Russia. Furthermore, the gate is not closed to Russia. 
  True, our right-wing press, which speaks through the mouth 
of 
the opposition, is full of suspicions toward Bill Clinton and 
other Western leaders concerning the fact that Lithuania's fate 
has already been decided and so on. This does not surprise me 
because suspicion is, probably, the key trait of the current 
opposition. 
  However, if we approved of these suspicions, then there 
would 
be no sense in creating a state at all. 
  As far as I know, the Lithuanian Government trusts the 
decency of the United States and other big states. Therefore, 
it has appealed to NATO and wants closer cooperation with the 
European Union. 
  [Sniukas] Your office is a political one. Given our 
opposition's clamor, you must be scolded quite often.... 
  [Linkevicius] The press criticizes the ministry more often 
than me personally. It is difficult to tell which bitter 
article was inspired by politicians or the editorial board 
itself. 
  I know the principles of the press because I myself have 
been 
a journalist. I understand that spicy material means high 
circulation and prestige for a publication. 
  Nevertheless, before issuing criticisms, I wish reporters 
considered whether their articles would discipline an 
unsuccessful official or provide grounds for foreigners to think 
how awful the Lithuanian Army is. 
  Journalists sometimes do not realize that definite criticism 
(often without arguments!) makes all soldiers anxious, impairs 
their good spirits, and increases their nihilism. 
  I would also like to note one more issue. Journalists have 
no secrets, while we, the military, must keep many of them. We 
could reply to some articles but we would then have to 
declassify certain things. Since we cannot do this, one is left 
with the impression that the press is always right, while the 
National Defense Ministry is always wrong. 
  No matter how many troubles -- objective and subjective -- 
we 
may have in our armed forces, let us cherish them. Let us scold 
them, but let us say a few good words as well! 
  [Sniukas] Only some of the conscripts come to the Army 
today. There is a prevailing opinion among the community that 
only the children of ordinary parents (I will refrain from using 
stronger epithets) perform the duty of their homeland defense. 
They are a type of recruit. I have not heard of children of 
high officials, Seimas deputies, millionaires, and Gariunai 
[notorious market-place near Vilnius] boys serving in the Army. 
  [Linkevicius] You are correct to note this. Because we 
cannot draft everyone, various excuses and advantages ensue. 
  [Sniukas] I can again impart the public opinion, in case you 
do not know it. "Good children of good men" do not serve in the 
Army due to bribes and connections. 
  We lament that physically weak and unfit youngsters come to 
the Army. While they are living a difficult everyday Army life, 
their contemporaries with strongly built muscles are flying to 
Beijing, Istanbul, or Amsterdam, enriching themselves daily, and 
even mocking the Army. Do we not discredit the sacred duty of 
homeland defense in this way? Does not service in the Army 
become the job of simpletons? 
  [Linkevicius] I would not use such strong words. However, 
the problem is serious. Conscription commissions are 
subordinated to the Health Ministry, and we are unable to 
control bribes. I will be self-critical -- both our ministry 
and the Prosecutor General's Office are conniving. 
  We could introduce alternative service, but it is difficult 
to organize it under economic depression. Military departments 
at higher educational establishments could train officers in the 
reserve. 
  [Sniukas] I would propose the following plan of conscription 
to military service: We should draft the strongest and 
healthiest persons. If the latter did not want to serve they 
could ransom themselves for, let us say, 10,000 or 50,000 litai. 
There would be many such people, while the National Defense 
Ministry could raise another budget as the one assigned by the 
state. The money which now flows as bribes into the pockets of 
commission members would go to the National Defense Ministry 
account. 
  Certainly, all this should be fully voluntary. Then 
servicemen would not envy those who have paid the ransom, while 
the latter would not feel the humiliating superiority. Such a 
principle could be abandoned after imposing order in the 
country's legal system, and after economic possibilities for the 
expansion of Army ranks emerge. 
  [Linkevicius] This is an interesting proposal but it is the 
matter of the Seimas. 
  [Sniukas] Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb 22, ELTA -- On Tuesday the fifth and, 
hopefully, the last Lithuanian-Polish negotiation round for the 
bilateral agreement was held at the Polish Foreign Ministry. 
The negotiations were headed by the Foreign Vice-Ministers 
Vladislavas Domarkas and Iwo Byczevski. 
  On the eve of the negotiations Byczevski said that he hoped 
to reach the final solution of all disputable questions. He 
added that there would not be a separate declaration on the 
Vilnius region annexation in 1920. Byczevski also noted that 
Poland would point out requirements of the Polish minority in 
Lithuania in the agreement. 
  Members of Lithuanian state delegation also told ELTA that 
there would not be a separate declaration, but historical 
aspects important for the both countries would be mentioned in 
the preamble of the agreement. 
  On Tuesday [22 February] Polish Catholic daily THE SLOWO 
published an open letter from the federation of the Polish who 
live in the border territories in Poland (the Kreis 
organizations) to Polish prime minister. They required to 
consider the part of the agreement concerning the rights of the 
Polish minority in Lithuania in the Polish-Lithuanian 
negotiations.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 22, BNS -- "The Vilnius problem will 
surely be mentioned in one or another form in the treaty with 
Poland," said Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy minister of 
foreign affairs. 
  Januska said Lithuanian and Polish positions on the 
estimation of disputed historic events have "sufficiently drawn 
closer." Therefore it became possible "to choose formulas that 
would satisfy both sides," he said. 
  A delegation of Lithuanian negotiators, led by Vladislovas 
Domarkas, deputy minister of foreign affairs, left for Warsaw 
Monday [21 February], to continue talks on some disputed clauses 
of the Lithuanian-Polish agreement on friendship and cooperation. 
  Januska regretted that his Polish counterpart Iwo Byczewski, 
who heads the Polish negotiation team, "speaks widely about 
things that might only become a result of talks." 
  The Polish news agency PAP quoted Byczewski as saying that 
Lithuania gave up its intentions to sign a separate declaration 
on the 1920 annexation of Vilnius together with the main 
agreement. 
  Lithuanian radio said Monday that the Polish official 
expressed doubt whether history will be discussed in detail, 
except for several "general" sentences in the preamble of the 
accord. 
  In Januska's opinion, the return of history to the text is 
considered a positive step but "not just another concession of 
the Lithuanian side. 
  "It seems, we have reached a stage when a return to the 
initial formula can be made -- to include everything in one 
treaty, and this makes things more significant." 
  Lithuania sought to mention the annexation of Vilnius in the 
main agreement from the very beginning of interstate talks, but 
when Poland disagreed, the Lithuanian side suggested to move 
history to a separate declaration that would be signed 
simultaneously. 
  The Lithuanian negotiators are scheduled to return from 
Poland Feb. 23.

<F P=106> [From the "Latvian Press Review"] </F>
  [Text] Riga, February 22, LETA -- "Skrunda -- Is it a 
military or political problem" - it is the question that the 
former Latvian Defence Minister Talavs Jundzis, the Director of 
the Baltic Center for Strategic Research at the Latvian Academy 
of Science, sought to give an answer to on the pages of the 
newspaper "Diena". The regiment No. 18591 of the Russian Armed 
Forces takes up 500 hectares of land in the district of Ranki, 
county of Kuldiga, 5 kilometers from Skrunda where the 
controversial radar base is located. Such missile-attack early 
warnings radars first appeared in 1960's in the U.S. and the 
Soviet Union simultaneously. The radar base in Skrunda is only 
one of the eight similar military sites erected along the 
perimeter of the former USSR. Jundzis said that the site in 
Skrunda could be effectively substituted by radar stations 
situated in Mukachevo and Murmansk. The equipment of the base in 
Skrunda is worn-out and obsolete. The American experts who 
visited the site in 1993 were extremely surprised that the 
station was still functioning at all. 
  According to Jundzis, to keep this Russian military site in 
Latvia would mean to preserve the direct Russian military 
influence and interests in Latvia for at least five-and-a-half 
years which would result in Latvia still being included in the 
zone of direct influence of the Russian military doctrine and 
its armed forces as well. The agreement on Skrunda turns Latvia 
into a voluntary hostage for the collective security of the CIS 
countries with unpredictable consequences that makes the Baltic 
Republic to undertake a number of unsubstantiated obligations 
towards the Russian militaries and army veterans, Jundzis said. 
It would be naivete to think that in 1996 Zhirinovsky or any 
other similarly-minded person would keep to the agreement signed 
by Yeltsin in 1994. For Latvia, it would be more preferable not 
to sign the agreement as it might at least induce the 
international organizations to observe their own resolutions 
calling for fast and complete withdrawal of the Russian troops 
from Latvia.

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Excerpts] The report on the upcoming Russian-U.S. military 
exercises is an important piece of news. The fact of a joint 
operation of units of the two armies, which were adversaries in 
the recent past, is not surprising. However, details of such 
events are always interesting. Here is Colonel General Georgiy 
Kondratyev, Russian deputy defense minister, with the details 
for "Slavyanka." 
  [Begin Kondratyev recording] It is the first time in the 
existence of the Russian Armed Forces, and, beyond it, in the 
whole period of the former Soviet Union, that such exercises 
will take place. They will be joint, and will involve the 27th 
Motor Rifle Division of the Volga military district of the 
Russian Armed Forces and the 3d Infantry Division of the U.S. 
Army. 
  Currently we -- that is myself, as deputy defense minister, 
the infantry command, and the command of the Volga military 
district -- we have already designed these exercises. According 
to our design, the main aims of these exercises are: 
  First -- to jointly consider issues of a possible planning 
of 
peace keeping operations -- which documents are necessary for 
them, how the personnel should be trained -- and also, during 
the exercises themselves we will practice the real actions, an 
approximation to actions of U.S. and Russian subunits in 
conflict zones, i.e. real peacekeeping operations. 
  Not only the headquarters of those two divisions, but also 
some subunits will be involved from both sides, because these 
are command and staff exercises that also include troops. We 
agreed that from 200 to 250 men, up to two companies, will take 
part on each side and will use their usual military hardware and 
means of reinforcement. I believe that these exercises will go 
very well, and our officers will obtain certain expertise in 
planning and deploying peacekeeping operations not only in CIS 
countries but possibly anywhere in the world. [passage omitted] 
  Why has this become necessary? From 1992, as you know, we 
have deployed peace keeping operations in the Dniester area, in 
South Ossetia, and also in North Ossetia and Ingushetia to some 
degree -- there is a group of troops there. We also we took 
part, to a degree, in the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict, and the 
recent agreement between Russian President Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin and Mr. Shevardnadze in Tbilisi envisages that Russians 
may deploy a peace- keeping operation in Abkhazia under the 
umbrella of the CSCE and maybe the United Nations as well. We 
have been working toward it. 
  That is why there is an obvious necessity today to share 
experiences by way of organizing such exercises. We will 
continue to have exercises. I believe this is useful for both 
the Russian and the American sides. It is also useful for other 
countries. [end recording]

to withdraw their weapons, but they were rather cautious of the 
similar demands issued by the UN. How would you explain this? 
  [Ryurikov] Well you know, I can only say it was simply a 
matter of knowing how to negotiate, of using convincing 
arguments, finding the right tone at the right moment, and 
generally being well-skilled in the art of diplomacy. I think 
that for all these reasons our arguments were accepted this time. 
  [Mikhailov] But there are still the Muslims and Croatians. 
What will they do now? 
  [Ryurikov] We hope that they respond with goodwill gestures 
to the goodwill gesture. We also hope that our partners 
involved in the settlement of this conflict who work in close 
contact with them will ensure this in the same way as we did our 
work.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS corespondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin called to hold a summit with leaders of four major NATO 
members to "put an end to the Yugoslav conflict". 
  The Russian president said on Wednesday [23 February] that 
he 
believes it possible to sign a joint agreement between leaders 
of Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France and Germany 
which would end the bloodshed in former Yugoslavia. 
  "Russia should more courageously and resolutely join the 
European and world community and other international 
organisations", Yeltsin told reporters after laying a wreath to 
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Wednesday in connection with 
the Day of Motherland Defenders. 
  "Attempts of certain leaders to keep Russia away from 
solving 
international security issues is a discrimination. Russia has 
to and will participate in all major international events as a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council", the Russian 
president stressed. 
  He added that the NATO decision to bomb Bosnian Serbs 
"caused 
indignation not only among Russian diplomats, but among all 
citizens of Russia". 
  Russia had to resort to urgent measures which it had 
proposed 
to the United Nations a year ago. "The Russian leadership 
recommended to the United Nations to take Sarajevo under its 
administrative control as the most disputed city", Yeltsin said. 
  Russian contacts with Slobodan Milosevic and the trip of 
special envoy Vitaliy Churkin to Bosnia averted the catastrophe, 
according to the president. 
  "In contrast to NATO which announced an ultimatum to Serbs, 
Russia requested the Serbs to pull back their heavy guns", the 
president said adding that this was "a psycologically 
well-thought out move which has worked". 
  To ensure safety of the Serbs Russia sent 400 peace-keepers 
from Croatia to Sarajevo at a request of Milosevic. "Despite 
heavy snow the guys arrived in Sarajevo in time", Yeltsin said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav </F>
Kostikov by Aleksey Burmistenko, TRUD international desk editor; 
place and date not given: "President's Strong Move"] 
  [Text] [Burmistenko] What is your assessment of the 
political consequences of the Russian president's actions 
regarding the Sarajevo conflict? 
  [Kostikov] B.N. Yeltsin's initiative has led to a major 
Russian diplomatic victory not only on the European stage but on 
the world stage as well. Without a single shot being fired, 
without threatening anyone or posing a risk to our soldiers' 
lives, and without spending a single ruble, Russia has 
effectively won a most important battle for its world status. 
  It is not just that Russia has returned to the sources of 
its 
historical political role in the Balkans by protecting the 
Serbs, who are close to us in religious, cultural, and national 
terms. Russia has firmly marked out the parameters of its 
influence in Europe and the world. It has become clear that no 
small or great power can fail to take account of Russia's 
position and national interests. It has become clear that no 
international organization of a universal or military character 
can make effective decisions unless it takes account of Moscow's 
voice. 
  The illusory nature of the notion that any major problem in 
Eastern Europe can be resolved behind Russia's back has become 
apparent. 
  It has become clearer that though it is withdrawing its 
military contingents from Central and East European countries, 
in full accordance with Russia's new foreign policy doctrine, 
Moscow remains a powerful and significant presence in Europe by 
virtue of its national policy. 
  [Burmistenko] The communist opposition has recently accused 
B.N. Yeltsin of diminishing Russia's status as a great power. 
Is there any basis for this? 
  [Kostikov] The Russian president's actions and their 
consequences have revealed a fact that is extremely important 
for world politics as a whole. They have stressed the role of 
the great powers, and particularly of Russia, in resolving 
international conflicts. Let us recall how much time, effort, 
and talk have been expended by the United Nations and NATO in 
order to deal with the conflict. As a result of all these 
diplomatic maneuvers, the world very nearly found itself on the 
brink of a world crisis which threatened to spill over into war 
and drag in the major powers. 
  The Russian president has made a single strong chess move, 
and the threat has been averted and preconditions have been 
created for a definitive settlement. So I think it would be 
more accurate to talk about B.N. Yeltsin's role in restoring 
Russia's status as a great power. 
  [Burmistenko] What impact might the resolution of the 
Sarajevo conflict have on the internal political situation in 
Russia? 
  [Kostikov] Let us recall how many spiteful and often 
venomous barbs have been cast in Boris Yeltsin's direction on 
this score by our ultranationalists. There are few deadly sins 
the president has not been accused of: betraying our national 
interests, forgetting our national dignity, selling Russia off 
to the evil West, and surrendering Russian positions to the 
United States, and how much political speculation there has 
been! Only lazy people have not gone to former Yugoslavia in 
order to accumulate political capital, so to speak. 
  Without leaving Moscow, President Yeltsin has achieved what 
the political chatterers could not and did not achieve. He has 
actually demonstrated the provision enshrined in the new 
Constitution which says that the Russian president is the 
guarantor of the country's national interests. Calmly, without 
haste and without excessive publicity and ballyhoo, he has shown 
that as of today he is the indisputable leader of Russia. 
  It is sufficient to ask just one question: Who other than 
Yeltsin could currently say things, and say them in such a way, 
that he will be listened to in Sarajevo, Europe, and the world? 
Nobody else, in my opinion. This, incidentally, sheds indirect 
light on the issue which the communist opposition is currently 
making such a fuss about: Should Russia make haste to hold 
presidential elections? Should all sorts of commissions be 
established to investigate the events of 3-4 October with a 
single and clearly provocative objective -- to give the 
president a "nasty nip." 
  [Burmistenko] Can we expect some other new steps from B.N. 
Yeltsin regarding the resolution of the crisis in Sarajevo? 
  [Kostikov] The president's opponents have always maintained 
that Yeltsin is unpredictable, extravagant, and impulsive.... 
Over the past few days, during the Bosnian crisis, we have if 
you like seen a new president of Russia: A predictable, 
calculating, and crafty diplomat who is sure of himself and his 
country's policy. By his initiative, the president has created 
good preconditions for resolving the crisis. I think this 
political capital should be carefully developed and built up by 
diplomatic efforts. Without excluding the leaders of other 
countries, of course, or international organizations. It seems 
to me that an international conference at the highest level is 
called for in order to settle the issue once and for all. And 
Russians can rest assured that their national interests and the 
interests of Russia's traditional allies will be reliably 
protected.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 21 February devotes its "Details" program 
to the situation around Sarajevo, the status of Russian blue 
helmets there, and an comments by Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev. 
  Announcer Sergey Dorenko opens the program with the 
following: 
  "The top echelons of the Russian Defense Ministry are 
entirely engrossed in the problems of 400 Russian soldiers who 
became a human shield in the war in Bosnia. Here, in the 
defense minister's office, decisions are made that determine the 
lives of our soldiers in Sarajevo, the future of peace in 
Bosnia, and the fate of the defense minister himself, even if 
you are completely indifferent to it. Good evening! Four 
hundred Russian paratroopers occupied new positions on the 
southeastern front of Sarajevo. The decision to bring in troops 
contradicted Moscow's previous plans. We know that before this, 
on Friday, a sharp address with regard to NATO was to be read 
out. Moreover, the address was to be accompanied by the 
complete withdrawal of Russia's blue helmets, and also from the 
Serb Krajina in Croatia. And suddenly, everything changed. 
Moscow previously believed that troops should not be put under 
bullets until the warring sides sign a peace agreement. Here we 
are. There is no peace agreement and the decision on NATO 
bombings has not been changed. One should not fully trust what 
the Serbs or the Bosnians say, but the troops were brought in." 
  He goes on to say that the attack on the Sarajevo market 
might be repeated, but this time Russian servicemen might be 
affected by it. He recalls that the Serbs failed to complete the 
disarmament, partly because of severe weather conditions, 
shortage of fuel, and the immobility of some of the equipment. 
He recaps the movement of the Russian battalion and problems it 
encountered on the way. He says: "In Bosnia, our paratroopers 
met the Ukrainian battalion. The Ukrainians have stayed in 
Sarajevo for a long time and they said that they were often 
fired on. Even the outwardly neutral Ukrainians suffer because 
they are Christians. Thus, a handful of Russian lads turned out 
to be hostage to Balkan military passions, hostage to the 
ambitions of military generals from NATO and hostage to 
terrorist gangs that are not controlled by anyone." 
  Dorenko then interviews Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev, asking: "We have learned that the Russian Government 
intends in the near future to ask the upper chamber of the 
parliament to give a go- ahead to sending another 600 servicemen 
to Bosnia." 
  Grachev replies: "Our 27th motor rifle division of the 
Maritime district is practically ready for this purpose, and 
also 46th motor rifle division in the Leningrad district. They 
will also fulfill the task fully like 1,200 paratroopers of the 
106th airborne division." 
  Dorenko continues by saying that Russian diplomats in the 
area of the conflict advised the Russian battalion to move 
closer to the French in hope that the latter would not be 
bombed. The Russian Defense Ministry, he adds, hopes that NATO 
would not carry out "the operation of revenge that was already 
calculated in details without informing us first." Dorenko says 
today that Grachev spoke about this with his American colleague. 
  Dorenko goes on to say that there are areas where there is 
just 50 meters between the trenches occupied by the Croats, 
Serbs, and Russians and that there might be serious clashes 
there in four to six months. 
  Concluding the program, Dorenko says that "in order not to 
ruin your mood completely, I leave you in the company of a man 
who is a bit more optimistic than me, Minister Grachev." 
  Grachev's statement ends the program: "As for my proposal to 
bring an additional contingent to the territory occupied by the 
Muslims, I know that the U.S. plan does not include the use of 
ground forces, but perhaps we should propose to the British, 
French, and Germans -- they are stationed here close enough and 
have enough troops and we all know well the three defense 
ministers -- maybe we can reach an agreement on this issue at 
our next meeting?"

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 22 TASS -- The idea of averting 
threatened NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions was 
developed by Russian diplomats and military. Diplomatic efforts 
by Russia, which took an independent stand on Bosnian 
settlement, were backed by the Russian Defence Ministry's 
concrete steps. 
  When asked by TASS to comment on the latest developments in 
Bosnia, the Defence Ministry's information and press department 
said Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev had repeatedly 
called upon NATO to reverse its ultimatum threatening Bosnian 
Serbs with air strikes and to find a political solution to the 
armed conflict. 
  These appeals were voiced during recent meetings in Moscow 
with high-ranking foreign military leaders -- French Defence 
Minister Francois Leotard, inspector general of the German 
Bundeswehr Klaus Naumann and British secretary of state for 
foreign and commonwealth affairs Douglas Hurd. 
  Simultaneously, the Russian defence minister continuously 
took efforts, through both diplomatic and its own channels, to 
avert NATO air strikes against any of the warring factions. The 
Defence Ministry's initiatives were based on the February 
message by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the U.N. secretary 
general on possible ways of settling the Sarajevo crisis. 
  At his own initiative, the Russian defence minister 
discussed 
Bosnian settlement on the phone with his U.S. counterpart 
William Perry for three times last week. Specifically, during 
Monday's conversation Grachev, as the Russian president's 
authorized person, drew Mr Perry's attention to the fact that 
Bosnian Serbs were gradually withdrawing their heavy weapons for 
20-30 kilometers from around Sarajevo or hand them over to U.N. 
control. The ministers considered possible measures to ease 
tensions around the Bosnian capital. 
  According to military observers, this and other moves by the 
Russian military command rested upon the firsthand assessment of 
the situation in the conflict zone. Thus, an on-the-spot 
reconnaissance group from among staff officers of Russian 
peacekeeping forces deployed in Serb Krajina, as well as a group 
of the Russian Defence Ministry officials headed by airborne 
troop commander Yevgeniy Podkolzin were sent to the area of 
possible air strikes. The Russian military obtained guarantees 
from Bosnian Serbs that they would strictly fulfill their 
obligations on big guns withdrawal. They also looked into all 
political and organizational issues concerning the deployment of 
Russian peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, including their possible 
reinforcement. 
  As a result, 400 Russian paratroopers were stationed in the 
buffer zone between the confronting sides near Sarajevo. These 
military units were transferred here from Croatia with the 
approval of the U.N. secretary general. Russian Defence 
Ministry officials believe the presence of Russian peacekeepers 
in the epicenter of the Bosnian conflict was key to achieving an 
agreement between Russian special envoy for former Yugoslavia 
Vitaliy Churkin and the Bosnian Serb leader. 
  According to Russian military, Russia's peacekeeping troops 
transferred to the conflict zone need reinforcement. A decision 
to send to Bosnia extra peacekeepers numbering up to 300 
fighters should be approved by the Russian State Duma.

<F P=106> [Sergey Sidorov report: "Moscow Suggests That United States </F>
Send Troops to Sarajevo"] 
  [Text] "Not everyone likes the presence of the Russian 
`blue helmets' in the Sarajevo region, but the result is not in 
doubt: There are no combat operations being conducted and no 
firefights." So said Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense 
minister, to his U.S. counterpart William Perry during a 
telephone conversation Monday evening. The conversation over 
the "hot line" was conducted by the Russian defense minister 
from his office and lasted around an hour. 
  It was the latest in a series of extraordinary telephone 
contacts devoted to the situation around the Bosnian capital. 
Army Gen. P. Grachev expressed concern that he still is not 
clearly aware of the Bosnian Muslim side's intentions as regards 
the fulfillment of NATO's demands and in particular with regard 
to the Russian contingent's presence in Sarajevo. He voiced 
misgivings that provocations against Russian servicemen might 
bring a drastic deterioration in the situation and disrupt the 
efforts being made by Russia and the NATO countries. In this 
connection Pavel Grachev suggested that the U.S. side consider 
Russia's proposal for a U.S. military contingent to be sent to 
Sarajevo and stationed on Muslim-controlled territory. 
  According to Army Gen. P. Grachev, W. Perry promised to 
brief 
President Bill Clinton on this proposal. However, the Pentagon 
chief deemed it necessary to stress that the White House does 
not as yet have any plans to send its contingent to Bosnia. At 
the Russian defense minister's request his U.S. counterpart 
briefly explained the NATO Council's stance on the question of 
the Serbian side's fulfilment of NATO's demands, which 
effectively boils down to the idea that, if the Bosnian capital 
is threatened again, that may be sufficient cause for bombing 
raids. Without rejecting that approach, Army Gen. P. Grachev in 
turn again emphasized the immutability of Russia's position, 
which considers air strikes on any of the conflicting parties' 
facilities to be intolerable. 
  At the close of the conversation the ministers expressed 
their satisfaction with the level of mutual understanding and 
cooperation. It was agreed to continue their contacts on Bosnia 
once a week. 
  When asked by journalists whether the threat of bombing 
should be considered to have been removed once and for all, 
Pavel Grachev replied that he thinks air strikes "unlikely." As 
for the additional contingent from Russia that will be sent to 
Sarajevo if the State Duma gives its approval, according to the 
Russian minister, it "will not necessarily be manned by airborne 
troops." Units of the 27th and 46th Motorized Rifle Divisions 
have been trained to perform peacekeeping functions [K 
vypolneniyu mirotvorcheskikh funktsiy podgotovleni.... NB: an 
alternative reading could be "Units of the 27th and 46th 
Motorized Rifle Divisions have been readied to perform 
peacekeeping functions].

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin </F>
by Sergio Sergi in Moscow; date not given: "`It is a Mistake To 
Put Russia Out of the Game'"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- [Sergi] How was a turning point on Bosnia 
possible? How did you construct this diplomatic success? 
  [Adamishin] We had been moving toward this goal for almost a 
year and a half. At that time, we had already made a proposal 
at the UN General Assembly to demilitarize Sarajevo and place it 
under UN protection. We worked with all the sides but certainly 
used the leverage that we have had on the Serbs. I believe that 
it is difficult for anyone else to have more influence than us 
in this field. It was not that we were defending their position 
to the bitter end or that we were manifesting our pan-Slavism. 
The Serbs were aware of the fact that we supported a balanced 
political settlement. 
  [Sergi] Therefore they took you seriously. 
  [Adamishin] Now they believe in us. For this reason, when 
Yeltsin made a proposal for the unilateral withdrawal of their 
heavy weapons from the hills around Sarajevo, they said yes. It 
was the culmination of our efforts as well as a clear 
manifestation that political methods prevail over the use of 
force when settling conflicts. 
  [Sergi] This was a point of major dispute between Russia and 
the foreign governments. 
  [Adamishin] Yes. You see, we share more or less the same 
view as our partners on "what" must be done. However, the 
positions diverge on "how" it must be done. We have always been 
supporters of political methods over the use of force except for 
very specific, restricted cases regulated by the United Nations. 
For this reason we did not like the NATO ultimatum which, to 
tell the truth, shuffled the cards. The talks had already begun 
and the ultimatum made the Muslims become more uncompromising. 
The situation became difficult, there was no way out. Russia 
brought its own influence into play to find a way out. If 
things go well, if the other side now does what the Serbs have 
done, we will truly be able to speak of an opening in the 
Bosnian situation. After Sarajevo, the accord can be further 
extended. 
  [Sergi] What guarantees do you have that the Serb side will 
not have second thoughts? 
  [Adamishin] The guarantees are those of the Bosnian Serbs' 
elective assembly. The decision was not made by one man alone. 
I do not see any reason why they should break their promise. 
The weapons have been withdrawn. 
  [Sergi] Your envoy, Churkin, has said that if the Serbs were 
to change their mind, even Russia will change its position. Is 
this so? 
  [Adamishin] I do not want to consider hypothetical 
situations. And then I would not want to contradict Churkin who 
has done very well. 
  [Sergi] We have also been forced to note some rigidity over 
the past few hours. Yeltsin has given a warning, Churkin has 
again pointed his finger against the ultimatum. Strong notes... 
  [Adamishin] I have not noticed these strong notes. In my 
opinion the NATO ultimatum could be judged even more severely. 
  [Sergi] So you are still using soft notes? 
  [Adamishin] For me they are. You see, the NATO ultimatum 
took over from the United Nations to put us out of the game. Or 
rather, thinking that we would be placed out of the game. I 
repeat: the ultimatum upset negotiations. I have already said 
that the Muslims immediately became more inflexible. The 
ultimatum is a mistake. It was made on the wave of public 
indignation over the Sarajevo market massacre. I fully share 
this indignation, but taking decisions of such an importance 
with consequences that are difficult to calculate on the basis 
of emotions is a little too much. 
  [Sergi] There are reports that the massacre was the work of 
Muslim formations. What do you say? 
  [Adamishin] If the Serbs had been guilty, it would have been 
made known immediately. If there had been certain evidence, it 
would have been made known. We also have some information in 
our possession that would point to strangers not from the area 
as being guilty. 
  [Sergi] Strangers in which sense? 
  [Adamishin] I am referring to people that arrived in Bosnia 
from outside... 
  [Sergi] From where? 
  [Adamishin] What do you mean from where? It is a known 
fact that there are various kinds of mujahedin on the Muslim 
side. This is what I mean when I refer to people that came from 
outside. 
  [Sergi] Do you mean that you actually know about this. 
  [Adamishin] I would not want to swear to the leaks. But they 
do exist. 
  [Sergi] Do you have some clue if not certain evidence? 
  [Adamishin] We can judge on the basis of what the others 
say. 
We are distant from these places. The results of the 
investigations to date tell us that it is not known where the 
grenade came from. Officially I must keep to these versions. 
However I have read -- and these are leaks from Western sources 
-- about the involvement of forces that are not connected with 
the parties in question. 
  [Sergi] It has also been said that with your initiative you 
have done a favor to the West, which could not wait to get 
itself out of difficulty after the threat to bomb. Is this so? 
  [Adamishin] First and foremost, we did something entirely in 
favor of Sarajevo. If, along the way, we also did a small favor 
to the West it would not be a bad thing either. 
  [Sergi] Could there have been a secret accord between 
Yeltsin 
and Clinton? The United States could have reasoned this way: 
If Russia convinces the Serbs to withdraw we will publicly 
recognize your diplomatic success... 
  [Adamishin] You do not have a very good opinion of us. You 
think that we would act upon the suggestions of others. Russia 
has carried out an independent role, its own role, over the past 
months. We would like to see it concerted with the positions of 
the others, but it is the others that sometimes push us out. 
  [Sergi] What will the next move be? 
  [Adamishin] In my opinion it should be an attempt to go 
beyond the Sarajevo accord. That is, the search for a global 
solution to the conflict. We are close enough to the result. 
  [Sergi] Churkin has returned to the area of conflict. Why? 
  [Adamishin] He is going to Croatia where our battalion is. 
To stay there. To avoid any incitement or wrong moves. He 
will be in Sarajevo on his birthday. 
  [Sergi] If there was no secret accord with the White House, 
are we therefore witnessing the onset of a new rivalry between 
Russia and the United States? 
  [Adamishin] I would not want to light the fire on 
diversities. Certainly, as I have already said, we did not like 
the NATO ultimatum also because of the fact that it excluded 
Russia from the decisionmaking room. And all this while the 
positions on the crux of the problem were quite close. We do 
not agree that NATO should decide on these matters. If it is a 
matter of using force in international relations the Security 
Council must give the authorization. 
  [Sergi] The partnership is not in danger then? 
  [Adamishin] We want a partnership with the United States and 
NATO. But it should be seen as being a two-way street. We do 
not like this partnership if decisions are made without 
consulting Russia.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] As the crisis in Bosnia has shown, the West needs to 
learn "a new science of cooperation no less, if not more, than 
Russia does," the First Deputy Foreign Minister, Anatoliy 
Adamishin, told Interfax on Tuesday [22 February]. 
  According to him, Russia and the West will "go through 
periods of complications, since currently they are involved in 
readjusting their interests." 
  As the first deputy foreign minister said, Russia's present 
course is "to regulate the inevitable differences in interests 
by political means, through discussions, through partnership." 
"If we are pushed off this path of narrowing our differences, 
we'll have to search for other ways to uphold our interests, 
since our interests cannot be discarded. Therefore the West 
will have to reckon with us in one way or another," Adamishin 
noted. 
  "Cooperation with Russia will yield considerably greater 
results in the efforts to settle conflicts and ensure security 
in Europe, than relapses into confrontation with Moscow 
reminiscent of the "cold war," he pointed out. 
  President Boris Yeltsin's call for holding a special 
conference between the leaders of Russia, the USA, France, 
Britain and Germany to reach a political solution to the Bosnian 
issue remains in force, the diplomat stressed. 
  According to Adamishin, there is a need to find "a formula 
for consolidating cooperation." "The formats can be different. 
One of them is the Security Council and the U.N. in general. 
Another is what is taking place in Bonn, where high-ranking 
officials from 12 European Union countries, Russia, the USA and 
Canada began their consultations on Tuesday." 
  As Interfax's interviewee confirmed, at the conference 
Russia 
will be represented by the special envoy of its president, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin. The meeting will not be 
attended by the warring Bosnian sides. Its goal is to 
coordinate the endeavors of Russia and its Western partners to 
resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, who is making 
a tour of the countries involved in the "Visegrad Group," is not 
planning to visit Bonn, Adamishin said. "The conference is 
taking place on the level of experts," he explained. 
  According to the high-ranking diplomat, the turning of G-7 
into G-8 can become another form of interaction between Russia 
and the West. "NATO's Partnership for Peace program can also 
serve as an area where useful exchanges of views and 
coordination of differring stands can take place," he said. 
  With reference to problems connected with a settlement in 
Bosnia as such, Adamishin said that the withdrawal of heavy 
artillery and other military hardware from Sarajevo by the Serbs 
and Muslims is "a serious breakthrough achieved by political 
means." "Now it's essential to consolidate this first success," 
he said. 
  According to the diplomat, Russia has a clear-cut program 
for 
further actions in this direction. "It provides for a final 
demilitarization of Sarajevo. This can be achieved by means of 
placing the city under temporary U.N. administration, as 
virtually all plans for settlement envisaged," he said. 
  "The endeavors to resolve some other painful problems faced 
in Bosnia basing on the lessons taught by the Sarajevo crisis 
can pose another step," Adamishin noted. 
  He does not view the course of "further ultimatums" as "very 
productive," he pointed out. "As developments in and around 
Sarajevo have proved, the course of reaching a political 
solution to the conflict Russia has always pursued yields the 
best results. To bank on the assumption that all sorts of 
ultimatums will be repeated, and Russia will continue to break 
the deadlocks, will not lead to gaining a settlement," Adamishin 
said. 
  He said he disagrees with the allegations that "the Serbs 
would have had to yield to the NATO ultimatum anyway, and that 
Russia just helped to save their face by asking them to meet its 
request, not NATO's ultimatum." "Even though this concerns only 
intentions, nevertheless the possibility that the Serbs would 
have disregarded NATO's ultimatum cannot be ruled out. Events 
could have developed differently, which would have led to 
unpredictable consequences," Adamishin said. 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, the use of intimidation 
to achieve one's goal is not the most effective method in 
diplomacy. "This does not mean that Russia rejects the use of 
force altogether. Moscow agreed that the U.N. forces in former 
Yugoslavia can give rebuffs, if attacked. These forces include 
Russian servicemen, and we cannot leave them unarmed from this 
point of view. The question is that such decisions should be 
taken with great considerateness, through the only possible 
channel -- the U.N. Security Council," he stressed. 
  Russia's first deputy foreign minister called for a 
continuation of talks between the three warring Bosnian sides. 
"This is needed to reach a comprehensive solution in Bosnia, 
which had actually been gained. Subsequently the Muslims went 
back on it in the belief that they will gain more on the 
battlefield than at the negotiating table," Adamishin pointed 
out. "But since the ultimate goal is to achieve a final 
political settlement, Russia concedes that the plan suggested by 
the cochairmen of the international conference on settlement in 
the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, can 
be slightly and finally corrected." 
  The vice president of the Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, Aleksandr Vladislavlev, has described President 
Yeltsin's endeavors to settle the crisis in Bosnia as a 
remarkable success for Russian diplomacy. The reaction of all 
the parties concerned to the Russian president's initiative has 
proved that, "when Russia proceeds from its clearly understood 
interests and firmly upholds them, it regains the role of a 
great power," he told Interfax's correspondent. 
  Vladislavlev urged all political forces, above all the 
Federal Assembly, to discard prejudices and support the Russian 
president who has proved to be "an outstanding statesman." He 
also called upon all political parties and unions to use this 
opportunity to achieve concord in the country. 
  Russia's initiative concerning Sarajevo is a substantial 
success scored by Moscow; it proves that Russia has not 
abandoned its long- term policy in the Balkans, the well-known 
Yugoslav-born French businessman, Boris Vukobrat, who leads an 
international fund for peace and solution to critical 
situations, told Interfax. 
  Nevertheless, Vukobrat pointed out that the withdrawal of 
military hardware from Sarajevo "does not mean that peace in 
Bosnia has been achieved. However it might become a step toward 
peace, if the forces involved in it realize that the holocaust 
in Bosnia has gone too far, and that it endangers not only 
Yugoslavia, but also Europe as a whole." 
  He urged the European countries, above all Russia and the 
USA, to join their efforts to stop those who "wish to fan the 
flames in Bosnia." 
  Vukobrat called for preventing Bosnia from being divided 
into 
ethnic states. According to him, this would be "a historic 
mistake," since the liquidation of Bosnia is in the interests of 
no ethnic group living there. "A divided Bosnia will become a 
source of constant clashes, fresh wars and casualties," Vukobrat 
pointed out.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent Vitaliy Buzuyev] 
Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in a telephone 
interview with our correspondent, said the following: 
  [Begin Lavrov recording] As far as an ultimatum is 
concerned, we have already set out our position, and President 
Yeltsin and the Russian foreign minister have stressed -- and so 
has the chairman of the government -- that an ultimatum is not 
the way we consider it is necessary to act in this situation. 
We have not recognized NATO's ultimatum, and we have stressed 
the need to work within the framework of the UN Security Council 
resolutions. These resolutions, as is known, state the need for 
all sides to take measures to lift the blockade of Sarajevo and 
they warn the sides that, in the event of the UN peacekeeping 
forces coming under attack, these forces will respond and will 
receive support. Only in these instances can the use of force 
be permitted, and we have explained this in detail in our 
statements. We have also counterposed attempts to, so to speak, 
solve matters by an ultimatum with a policy toward political 
work and vigorous diplomatic actions which have, generally 
speaking, brought results. Incidentally, we put forward the 
idea of lifting the blockade of Sarajevo quite some time ago -- 
if you want to be exact, we were speaking about it last year 
when we proposed more than once that the Security Council should 
be convened precisely to examine the question of lifting the 
blockade of Sarajevo, which is the key to a solution to the 
whole Bosnian problem. [end recording] 
  [Buzuyev] In the opinion of many observers, the Russian 
initiative restores our country's position as a player which 
should be reckoned with in the international arena. Whether we 
are too late will become clear in the next few days or even 
hours.

  [Text] Bonn February 22 TASS -- A working meeting of heads 
of diplomatic services of Russia, the United States and Canada, 
as well as the EC states and U.N. representatives expressed 
concern over situation in Bosnian regions and said that 
developments around Sarajevo caused by the NATO ultimatum and 
active efforts of the Russian leadership are a major step 
towards termination of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  The Russian Federation was represented by special envoy of 
the Russian president and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin. 
  The negotiations decided to make use of the success achieved 
by joint efforts in settlement around Sarajevo and continue 
close interaction with the aim of immediate search for ways to 
settle the Bosnian conflict by all the warring sides, head of 
the German Foreign Ministry's political department Juergen 
Chrobog told a news conference here today. 
  The meeting praised possible achievement of understanding 
between the Bosnian Government and Bosnian Croats, said the 
German diplomat. 
  Possible uses of heavy armaments pulled back from Sarajevo 
in 
other Bosnian regions were described as a major problem. The 
meeting participants agreed to concentrate on the expansion of 
security zones, achieve stable truce in Sarajevo through 
efficient separation of the warring units, prevent the use of 
pulled back heavy armaments in other regions, ensure free access 
to the city of humanitarian convoys and restore normal life in 
Sarajevo with the help of U.N. units. 
  In the opinion of experts, it is necessary to replace U.N. 
personnel in Srebrenica and Jepa and ensure free access of 
humanitarian convoys to the area, immediately open the Tuzla 
airport for the delivery of humanitarian cargo, achieve truce 
and pullback of artillery and ensure access of humanitarian aid 
to Mostar, achieve efficient truce in central areas of Bosnia 
and ensure free access of humanitarian cargo in Maglaj. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS whether the Bonn working meeting 
discussed 
a summit on Bosnian settlement, whose idea was considered during 
a telephone conversation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl late last week, the German 
Foreign Ministry's political department head said participants 
in the working meeting will inform the state heads of the 
meeting discussion and results. 
  The politicians will decide what kind of meeting should 
discuss Bosnian settlement. The issue was not discussed in 
detail, meeting participants need some time to think.

  [Text] Bonn February 22 TASS -- High-ranking diplomats met 
in Bad-Godesberg in the neighbourhood of Bonn on Tuesday to look 
for new ways of reaching political settlement of the Bosnian 
crisis. Taking part in the meeting are heads of diplomatic 
agencies of Russia, the United States, member-states of the 
European Union, Canada and a U.N. delegation. The Russian 
delegation to the forum is led by special envoy of the Russian 
president and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Vitaliy Churkin. 
  Local diplomats say that the meeting has a purely working 
character. Participants are planned to discuss possibilities of 
applying measures, used for the withdrawal of heavy weapons, to 
other Bosnian regions and problems of stepping up relief 
supplies to the peaceful population of the republic. 
  An official press-release issued by the German Foreign 
Ministry says that the purpose of the meeting is to give a joint 
assessment of the political and military situation in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina on the whole. It is necessary to take advantage of 
a favorable moment in order to take joint and coordinated 
actions to improve a dangerous situation in which people in 
Sarajevo and other regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina found 
themselves, the press release said. 
  Diplomatic circles in Bonn pointed out that the meeting on 
the Bosnian crisis had been initiated by German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel. Last Thursday [17 February], after consultations 
in Athens, heads of Russian and German Foreign Ministries 
suggested an idea of holding such a conference in a joint 
telephone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  Later, this idea acquired a more concrete character in 
telephone conversations between the German foreign minister and 
his counterparts from EC countries and Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Washington Invites Kozyrev To </F>
Share in Sarajevo Victory"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Satisfaction over the victory in many 
ways depends on what it is called: a success, an achievement, 
or a triumph. Directly after the withdrawal of weapons from 
around Sarajevo became a fact and the threat of bloodshed 
receded, a pleasant scuffle began round the victory cake in 
various capitals. 
  The United States was still only just waking up when the 
mass 
media were broadcasting the news of exultation in Moscow over 
the "victory of Russian diplomacy." A little later a report 
arrived from Prague, where, according to agency reports, Russian 
Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev said that he sees no direct link 
between "our actions and the NATO ultimatum," and television 
repeatedly showed special envoy V. Churkin asserting that it was 
President Yeltsin's personal participation that was the key to 
the fact that the withdrawal of Serbian artillery passed off 
peacefully. 
  The United States had Monday off. It was Presidents Day, 
George Washington's Birthday. In view of the national holiday 
Clinton's team allowed itself a very small indulgence: to 
assemble a little later than usual at the White House -- 0900 
hours rather than 0730. 
  After the meeting with his staffers B. Clinton held a press 
conference. He was far from making any hints at revenge. On 
the contrary, he thanked his European allies, who, he said, 
unlike the United States, have many servicemen stationed in the 
combat zones of Yugoslavia, whose lives are under constant 
threat. 
  The U.S. President confidently rejected the idea of Russia's 
decisive contribution to the bloodless withdrawal of artillery 
from around Sarajevo. He again stressed that the desired result 
had been achieved thanks to NATO's decisiveness. 
  One of the most important points in the President's press 
conference was that, during the tense days and hours when the 
ultimatum deadline was moving closer and the threat of air 
strikes becoming increasingly real, the mechanism of 
consultations with Russia operated smoothly -- both at the 
presidential level, and between the leading officials of either 
country: foreign and defense ministers and UN representatives. 
  However, the victory rhetoric, fully justified as it is in 
the context of the complex internal political situation in the 
United States, and especially in Russia, has its own inertia. 
Beyond certain limits it could grow into a danger for the still 
fragile cooperation between the countries which has no deep 
traditions. 
  Hence the United States has deemed it necessary urgently to 
invite Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev for consultations in 
Washington. He is expected to arrive on Saturday [26 February].

<F P=106> [Interview with Presidential Aide D.B. Ryurikov by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- from the 
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Judging by U.S. President Clinton's statement, the 
United States is insisting on a wider use of diplomatic force to 
make good use of the precedent in Sarajevo. U.S. diplomats are 
already pressing for peace initiatives to be extended to other 
regions of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today, the aide to the Russian 
president on external issues told our correspondent in some 
detail about Russia's stance on this question. 
  [Correspondent] Dmitriy Borisovich, how will Russia further 
develop its diplomatic initiative in this area? 
  [Ryurikov] Well, Russia has not stopped its initiatives, and 
it will continue to develop them very actively. They will 
concern the creation of a stable and peaceful situation in 
Sarajevo -- that is, lifting the blockade of this region and 
possibly placing it under UN administration -- and then reaching 
agreement on roughly the same actions in other security zones on 
Bosnian territory. Of course these must be peaceful, 
diplomatic, political solutions, and the process of seeking a 
political settlement of the problems of Bosnia as a whole must 
be sharply stepped up. This must be based on the EC plan, 
possibly with certain changes, trying to achieve a settlement as 
soon as possible in order to stop all hostilities.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations February 22 TASS -- Russia has urged 
the United States and the European Union "to exert the necessary 
influence" on Bosnian Muslims in order to avoid any possible 
provocations in Sarajevo. 
  "It is crucial in this critical moment to exclude a 
possibility of any provocations and sabotage of the peace 
process. Not only Sarajevo's fate but the fate of Bosnian 
peaceful settlement on the whole depends on this", the Russian 
Foreign Ministry said in a statement distributed in the United 
Nations on Tuesday [22 February]. 
  Russia called on the West "to exert the necessary pressure 
on 
the Bosnian Government to make it cooperate with the United 
Nations in unblocking and demilitarizing Sarajevo", according to 
the statement circulated as a U.N. Security Council document. 
  If the U.S.A. and the European Union member countries press 
on Bosnian Muslims to make them help unblock Sarajevo, the West 
would act "on the same lines it declared while saying that 
political settlement of the conflict would be preferable", the 
document says. 
  It recalled the Russian initiative which made Bosnian Serbs 
pull back heavy guns from Sarajevo and added that Russia's 
"consequent line which excludes any unilateral ultimatums has 
yielded results". 
  "We are accounting that goodwill which was shown by one of 
the conflicting sides in the moment critical to the (conflict's) 
settlement will evoke equally concrete responsive moves", it 
reads. 
  Russia also proposed that after unblocking Sarajevo, the 
United Nations urgently consider ways of establishing its 
administration in the city and measures to stregthen other safe 
areas on the Bosnian territory.

<F P=106> [Sergey Sidorov article: "Threat of NATO Air Strikes </F>
Removed Thanks to Russia's Decisive Actions"] 
  [Excerpt] NATO will not have to employ its aircraft in the 
Sarajevo area, and the symbol of the averted threat is the 
handful of Russian assault troops who by their presence alone on 
the snow-covered hills around the Bosnian capital have improved 
the situation. That is the recurring theme of the reports from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina carried by the majority of the media. 
  Clearly NATO was secretly hoping for decisive intervention 
by 
Russia, knowing that it would be practically impossible to end 
the crisis situation around Sarajevo and the whole Balkan 
conflict without its more active participation. However, 
projects in diplomats' heads are one thing, real specific moves 
for which statesmen have to assume responsibility toward their 
own people and history are quite another. 
  NATO placed not just itself but the whole world in an 
extreme 
situation. Europe could have been faced with an unpredictable 
escalation of the Bosnian war. NATO could only be saved from 
itself by Russia, and Russia made that tough decision. By 
persuading the Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms or place them 
under UN control Moscow simultaneously contrasted its own 
reputation as a great world power to NATO's. A reconnaissance 
group from the staff of the Russian Blue Beret battalion 
stationed in Serbian Krajina plus a group from the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry headed by Colonel General Yevgeniy 
Podkolzin, commander of the airborne assault troops, were 
dispatched to the area of anticipated bombing. Their aim was to 
guarantee the Serbian side's fulfillment of its commitments to 
withdraw arms and to study all questions of a political and 
organizational nature connected with the Russian contingent's 
deployment, including its possible reinforcement. It should be 
specially stressed that this decision does to a certain extent 
run counter to Moscow's earlier ban on Russian assault troops' 
carrying out the order of the UN Forces Command in former 
Yugoslavia redeploying part of the force to Sarajevo. That ban 
was more than justified. Moscow could not let its soldiers pay 
with their lives for a NATO bombing decision which it had 
nothing to do with. Here the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry made efforts to prevent NATO air strikes against 
targets belonging to any side, including the Bosnian Muslims, 
both through diplomatic channels and via its own line of 
communications. 
  In a personal telephone conversation with U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry -- there had been three conversations in 
all as of Monday -- Army General Pavel Grachev, the Russian 
president's authorized representative, drew his American 
counterpart's attention to the fact that the Bosnian Serbs were 
systematically withdrawing their heavy artillery weapons 20-30 
km from Sarajevo or placing them under UN control. The 
withdrawal was being carried out in unfavorable weather 
conditions -- abundant snow and drifts on the roads -- which 
made it considerably more difficult for the Russian contingent 
to move forward and take up position. Not all the provisions of 
the ultimatum will perhaps have been met on schedule, but the 
Serbian side's firm intention to carry it out in full renders 
strikes redundant. Moreover, the Americans' attention was drawn 
to the fact that Russian soldiers in a number of spots find 
themselves on routes along which it was intended to carry out 
missile and bomb strikes. The U.S. defense secretary was 
informed of the Russian leadership's view, namely that the 
Bosnian Serbs' positive decision to withdraw their forces not 
only removed the question of using aircraft against the sides in 
conflict but also created real prerequistes for a political 
settlement of the conflict. In the Russian side's opinion, the 
positive procress now under way needs joint support. 
  As we were informed at the Russian Defense Ministry 
Information Administration, another telephone conversation will 
take place between Pavel Grachev and William Perry Monday 
evening, during which measures to relieve the tension 
surrounding the Bosnian capital will continue to be examined. 
Statements made by certain hotheads in NATO suggesting that it 
was premature to abandon air strikes and calls from them to 
"hold negotiations while simultaneously carrying out strikes" 
causes Russia special alarm. 
  Telephone contacts have also been maintained at the highest 
level. On Sunday, on the initiative of Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, a telephone conversation took place between him and 
President Bill Clinton. As a result of that conversation a 
final accord was reached on averting bombing in the light of the 
efforts made by Russian diplomats and military men. The U.S. 
President spoke highly of Boris Yeltsin's political initiative, 
which had made it possible to reduce the acuteness of the crisis 
substantially. It was confirmed during their conversation that 
all decisions arising from the development of the situation 
around Sarajevo will be made with UN mediation, as called for by 
the Russian side. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuznechevskiy article: "Yugoslavia: Moscow's Say </F>
Proved Crucial. Russia Handles Sarajevo Crisis in Seven Days"] 
  [Text] The West was unable to resolve the Sarajevo crisis 
in two years. Moscow has handled the task in seven days. 
  However two weeks ago the U.S. leadership and NATO circles 
did not even think of Russia being able to make a decisive 
contribution to resolving the Bosnian crisis. This was manifest 
particularly clearly when the ultimatum was being delivered to 
the Bosnian Serbs. Admittedly, the West suddenly had a thought 
and authorized the British prime minister during his visit to 
Moscow to slightly ease the awkwardness. Paris LE FIGARO wrote 
the following on this score: "The task facing the head of the 
British Government is no easy one: He has to find a compromise 
that will enable Moscow to save face and once again enter into 
dialogue with the West regarding a settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina after the double insult for Russia of the 
NATO ultimatum and Bill Clinton's statement to the effect that 
the Kremlin's position does not pose a 'major problem.'" 
  You can see from Western press articles how formal Major's 
mission was in this respect. The same LE FIGARO wrote in an 
article headlined "Yeltsin's Dilemma: Between the West and 
Serbia": "For Moscow it is a question of the need to find the 
elusive solution [prizrachnoye resheniye] that would enable it 
not to alienate the West and not betray the 'Slav brotherhood' 
linking Russia with the Serbs. That is why, after the 
announcement of the NATO ultimatum, Russian leaders have made -- 
so far with relative success -- a series of attempts to avoid 
inflicting air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs' positions." 
  Moscow's involvement did not, however, prove at all 
"elusive." As soon as the ultimatum was adopted the Russian 
Foreign Ministry gave notification that it regards it as 
"illegitimate and not in line with UN decisions," and during a 
conversation with John Major Boris Yeltsin spoke in even more 
forthright terms: "Some people are trying to resolve the 
Bosnian issue without Russia's involvement. We will not permit 
that." 
  Bill Clinton was forced to promise Boris Yeltsin 11 February 
during a telephone conversation that finally took place after 
several abortive attempts that he would persuade the Muslim 
government of Bosnia not to quit the negotiating process in 
Geneva in exchange for the Russian president trying to persuade 
the Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery and tanks from 
Sarajevo. 
  There is every indication that the U.S. President made this 
promise lightly since he had little faith that Yeltsin would 
indeed have any success in this endeavor. 
  However, Moscow's involvement proved more than vigorous, it 
proved crucial. 
  Thursday morning Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's 
special representative, gave Radovan Karadzic, leader of the 
Bosnian Serbs, and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic a 
personal message from Boris Yeltsin. 
  The text of the message indicated that Moscow had pondered 
everything down to the psychological nuances. 
  Treating Serbian leaders with respect, the Russian president 
made no demands on them. He asked them to withdraw their heavy 
artillery and tanks from Sarajevo and in exchange proposed that 
400 airborne troops from the Russian battalion of the UN 
peacekeeping forces stationed in Eastern Croatia would take up 
the positions they would vacate in the village of Lukavica near 
the Bosnian capital. (Incidentally, the Russian word "prosba" 
[request] sounds very mild in Serbian, where it is "molba"). 
  The Serbs realized straightaway that the Russians had 
proposed to offer their lives as a guarantee of peace in 
Sarajevo. After all, if NATO forces inflict air strikes, the 
bombs could land on Russian airborne troops and that would 
immediately bring a fundamental change in the situation 
throughout Bosnia. 
  President Clinton could not contain his amazement, primarily 
at Yeltsin's decision to send his peacekeeping contingent from 
Croatia to Sarajevo (his administration's spokesman Myers 
announced this). 
  Nor was it coincidence that Moscow did not say a single word 
about the NATO ultimatum. What is more, when the Russian Air 
Force Press Service announced Saturday 19 February that Russian 
airborne troops would not be redeployed until NATO lifted its 
ultimatum, the Russian Defense Ministry immediately issued a 
rebuttal, saying that the Russian Air Force Press Service had 
overstepped its authority. 
  At 1500 hours Thursday the Serbs gave their consent to 
Yeltsin's proposal. Friday 18 February they began withdrawing 
heavy arms from Sarajevo, and at midday on Saturday Russian 
airborne troops began moving from Croatia to Bosnia. They 
arrived on the spot Sunday evening after a day's march through 
the mountains in heavy snow. 
  As it is customary to say in such cases, there are no 
winners or losers in Sarajevo, peace is the victor. However, 
this popular expression is hardly appropriate here. Things are 
not like that in politics. 
  The Serbs have clearly won by withdrawing their heavy arms 
from Sarajevo: Now in the event of renewed explosions in 
Sarajevo no one wil be able to blame Serb artillerymen or tank 
personnel for this. 
  Having obtained peace in their capital, the Muslim 
leadership 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina has lost an opportunity to lift up its 
hands to the West asking it to inflict air strikes as punishment 
on the "infidels" who are allegedly annihilating civilians. 
  The West has obviously won; it does not now have to get 
embroiled in the adventure of outright military confrontation 
with a staunch and bellicose people, with the threat of creating 
a second Vietnam for itself (whether this applies to France or 
the United States). Henceforth efforts can be focused solely on 
finding a truly peaceful means of settling the conflict. 
  Moscow has unexpectedly found itself ahead; for a week it 
demonstrated to the international community the exceptional 
diplomatic potential of a great power. 
  So, many people have gained, although not everyone. 
  But it is nonetheless hard to get away from the impression 
that this turn of events is not to everyone's liking. 
  At first Moscow's initiative was greeted by the West with 
obvious (and seemingly sincere) relief: It would not have to 
become embroiled in an adventure involving air strikes Monday 
and put its head on the block. 
  The point is that, according to Western intelligence 
services, the Serbs' armed formations in Bosnia have a large 
number of long- range fixed-site antiaircraft missiles with a 
range of up to 40 km and an even larger number of 
shoulder-launched infantry missiles for use against aircraft. 
  What is more, the Americans well remember that in Vietnam 
the 
U.S. Air Force incurred its greatest losses not from missiles 
but from massive antiaircraft fire from the ground, against 
which the electronics that they used successfully in Iraq are 
powerless. In order to avoid losses from that kind of fire 
fighter bombers would be forced to fly at a higher altitude, but 
the accuracy of the aggressor's fire is dramatically reduced as 
a result of that kind of maneuver. 
  However, when the first shock of Moscow's resounding 
diplomatic success had passed in the West, the United States 
seemed to switch to ways of blocking the new Russian peace 
initiative. 
  In particular, when on Friday Andrey Kozyrev, building on 
the 
success achieved Thursday, forthwith suggested convening an 
international peace conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina next week 
in order to find a full solution to the Bosnian problem. The 
West attempted to "scupper" this new Moscow peace initiative: 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that long and 
careful preparations are needed for such a conference, which 
will take a great deal of time. 
  Following this Washington, the BBC reported, has made great 
efforts to persuade the Croats and Muslims to remain in a single 
Bosnian state. A very well thought-out move. If it was 
successful, the Serbs in Bosnia would be left totally isolated. 
In that case the territories they are holding could be declared 
occupied and the Serbs could thus continue to be kept outside 
the world community. They could thus be pressured with a view to 
forcing them to leave the territories they control. 
  There is every indication that Washington is trying to put 
its own plan into practice. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate 
Granic and Bosnian Prime Minister Big Haris Silajdzic had a 
separate meeting in Germany Saturday to discuss a possible 
solution to the Bosnian problem. 
  The meeting bore no fruit. That is not surprising. A month 
earlier Bosnian and Croatian Presidents Alija Izetbegovic and 
Franjo Tudjman met in Germany for the same purpose and were also 
unable to reach any agreement. It is not only that the 
interests of these two forces in Bosnia are diametricaly 
opposed. It is hard to imagine these two political forces being 
able to exist within a single state after two years of mutual 
enmity and after mercenaries from other Muslim countries being 
involved in the Bosnian Muslims' combat operations against the 
Croats. 
  The question does of course arise: What is the origin of 
this treachery? Clinton did after all promise to put pressure 
on the Muslims, propelling them toward peace, but U.S. diplomacy 
has begun to take the exact opposite course. Why? 
  The answer must be sought in public opinion. It now has a 
very strong influence on both Yeltsin and Clinton. 
  The BBC reports that, according to the results of a 
Russia-wide public opinion poll, over 66 percent of Russian 
citizens would regard NATO strikes on the Bosnian Serbs as an 
attack on Russia. And over 77 percent of respondents opposed 
NATO's threat to bomb Serbian heavy guns in positions around 
Sarajevo. 
  What realistic politician could have ignored such an 
explicitly expressed opinion from his own people? 
  It is the same in the United States. Clinton's promise to 
put pressure on the Muslims had not had time to be made known to 
the U.S. public at large before U.S. newspapers bristled with 
headlines describing what the U.S. President said as "ominous" 
and his position "an utter disgrace." 
  Nonetheless there is every indication that it will be very 
hard to stop the Bosnian peace settlement process after Russia's 
initiative. Friday Radovan Karadzic said: "We think that the 
war in Sarajevo is finally over." And Sunday 20 February 
Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special spokesman in 
the former Yugoslavia, voiced an even more optimistic opinion of 
the situation, saying that the Bosnian crisis as a whole may 
come to a peaceful close over the next few weeks.

Georgiy Shmelev] 
  [Text] Budapest, 22 Feb -- A whole range of problems linked 
with the peaceful settlement of the situation in Bosnia were 
discussed in Budapest late on Monday evening by Andrey Kozyrev 
and Beniamino Andreatta, the Russian and Italian foreign 
ministers. 
  The meeting took place at the request of the Italian 
minister, who flew to Budapest especially to hold talks with his 
Russian colleague. 
  In an exclusive interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondents at 
the end of the meeting, which had been held in the Russian 
Embassy, Beniamino Andreatta said: "I am heading for Brussels, 
and I made a request by telephone for this meeting to be 
organized so that I could discuss personally with Andrey 
Kozyrev, first of all, the situation in Bosnia and the 'happy 
ending' to the settlement of the Sarajevo problem. We agreed on 
the need for joint work on the problem of protecting other 
populated areas in Bosnia as well." 
  The main thing, the Italian minister stressed, was "not to 
lose momentum" in consolidating the good results now achieved in 
settling the situation around Sarajevo. In Beniamino 
Andreatta's view, this will be the first step on the path 
towards peace in Bosnia as a whole. Secondly, the minister 
continued, new impetus must be given to the process of finding a 
political settlement of the issue, holding various forums to 
this end. Also discussed was the "format" of some such meetings 
and negotiations. 
  In addition, we examined the European Union's plan of action 
and "worked on it" in order to determine "more realistic" 
borders and possibilities for the exchange of territories, and 
also some forms of arbitration, taking account of the region's 
particular historic, cultural, and ethnic features. In the 
minister's view, this will make it possible to arrive at a 
genuine settlement of the conflict in Bosnia. 
  It was also necessary to exchange opinions on the political 
future of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the minister continued, "and at 
least as a start we agreed on the possibility of maintaining 
Bosnia's present borders." 
  The Italian government is in favor of any settlement of the 
conflict which would predetermine cooperation at least between 
two ethnic national groups in Bosnia, and if it is impossible 
between all three, Beniamino Andreatta said. 
  Also discussed in detail was the problem of the sessions of 
countries of the Seven and the Eight, and the organization of 
genuine cooperation between the world's leading states. 
Preference must be given in this to examining economic aspects 
of such cooperation within the format of the Seven, and 
political aspects within the format of the Eight. 
  They also discussed the problems of the CSCE in the context 
of Yugoslav problems, and the situation in the Baltic countries 
(the minister intends to visit the Baltic countries in the near 
future). I believe that with the heightened activity of the U.S. 
and Russia to settle the situation in Bosnia the situation has 
significantly improved and the possibilities for a peaceful 
solution are now much more real than before, Beniamino Andreatta 
said in conclusion. 
  In turn, Andrey Kozyrev stressed in an interview with the 
ITAR- TASS correspondents that an extremely wide range of 
problems and ideas had been discussed. But above all attention 
had been focused on the question of how to move forward towards 
a settlement, in order to profit from the possibilities which 
have opened up for a political settlement and the enforcement of 
a security zone in Sarajevo and other areas. It is necessary to 
push forward the process of seeking a peaceful settlement in 
Bosnia as a whole. 
  Italy is now the coordinating country of the Seven, and we 
have examined the conditions for holding sessions of the Eight 
on political issues. We believe it is extremely important to 
establish full-scale relations of partnership with the U.S., 
Italy, and other states in the Seven on political aspects. 
Otherwise how can we achieve practical results in Bosnia or 
elsewhere? 
  Andrey Kozyrev believes that it is wrong to adopt "separate 
unilateral decisions; progress should be reached in the 
settlement of the Bosnian crisis by joint efforts." This 
constituted the essence of our meeting, for which I am extremely 
grateful to the Italian minister, Andrey Kozyrev said in 
conclusion. "Now it is my turn to catch my Italian colleague 
somewhere on the move", the Russian minister laughed.

  [Text] Budapest February 22 TASS -- "Our talks with Andrey 
Kozyrev focused on problems of bilateral relations between 
Moscow and Budapest," Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky 
told a joint press conference here on Monday evening [21 
February]. 
  According to the Hungarian minister, Russia is today the 
second largest economic and trade partner of Hungary, while the 
latter holds eighth place in the list of Russia's major economic 
partners. "Very important for the development of our cultural 
cooperation are contacts between the religious leaders of the 
two countries," the Hungarian minister said. He recalled in 
this connection that Budapest would be visited on March 3 by 
Patriarch of Moscow and All of Russia Aleksius II. 
  Dwelling on the Hungarian foreign policy's orientation, 
Jeszenszky noted that integration into the European structures 
of the North Atlantic treaty Organisation and the European Union 
were of primary importance for Budapest, as well as the 
country's active participation in the CSCE process and in the 
implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" programme. 
Touching on the situation in Bosnia, the Hungarian foreign 
minister stressed that "the stands of Budapest and Moscow on 
this question have no serious distinctions". 
  "Russia attaches great importance to relations with 
Hungary," 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told the press conference. 
"This is specially noted in the treaty between the two 
countries, recently signed at summit level." The minister 
expressed the hope that it would be ratified by the new Russian 
parliament. 
  "I wish to back my friend Jeszenszky's words about the 
prospects for relations between Russia and Hungary," Kozyrev 
stated. "Russia has no hegemonic or neo-imperialist designs in 
Central and Eastern Europe. The attraction of the peoples of 
our countries towards each other is perfectly natural," he added.

  [Text] Budapest February 22 TASS -- Hungarian President 
Arpad Goncz congratulated Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, currently here on a working visit, on success of the 
Russian initiative for peaceful Bosnian settlement. 
  He said the initiative has saved the world from troubles, 
sufferings and escalation of combat operations in former 
Yugoslavia. In the words of Goncz, the major Russian political 
success consolidated its international authority and position on 
the world scene and enabled NATO to overcome the post-ultimatum 
situation with dignity. 
  Goncz reminded Kozyrev of his latest meeting with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin when the Hungarian state head said 
Russia will continue to play a key role in solution of European 
problems. 
  On the same day, Kozyrev was received by Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross. The premier praised Russian diplomatic 
efforts to settle situation around Sarajevo and said decisive 
and constructive Russian efforts enabled Hungary to overcome a 
difficult situation, as it is geographically close to the 
Yugoslav conflict zone.

  [Text] Krakow, 23 Feb -- If all Russo-Polish talks go as 
well as the present talks, the path to friendship and 
cooperation will be covered much faster. That was how Andrey 
Kozyrev and Andrzej Olechowski, the foreign ministers of Russia 
and Poland, summed up the progress and results of the bilateral 
talks that ended here late in the evening on 22 February. 
  During the meeting, the whole spectrum of relations between 
the two states was examined, said A. Kozyrev, replying to 
questions from ITAR-TASS correspondents. A number of very 
interesting initiatives were put forward, covering the economy, 
culture and social relations between our countries. 
  Unfortunately, the Russian minister noted, many specific 
accords reached during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit 
to Warsaw last August have not been fully implemented. That is 
why the present talks are extremely important. We have met in 
order to "puff along," as Mr. Olechowski says, that is, to urge 
these processes on. We are on the right path, A. Kozyrev 
pointed out when appraising the state of bilateral relations. 
In the Russian minister's opinion, the part to be played by 
Poland and other Central European countries in building a united 
Europe is very important. Equitable Russo-Polish cooperation 
should be a substantial factor in it. 
  Our states official relations "do not look at all bad," A. 
Olechowski observed. The task now is to fill them "with 
benevolent content." Mr. Kozyrev and I have discussed a number 
of concrete actions and have made a number of concrete 
decisions: "We are thinking about some, we are working on 
others, and we have agreed on a third group." All that is the 
"puffing along," as my counterpart put it jokingly, the 
development of our relations . 
  Commenting at the request of the ITAR-TASS correspondent on 
the thoughts of the Polish mass media on the present role of 
Russia -- as "adversary or partner of Poland," A. Olechowski 
said: "Neighbors should never be adversaries. The question now 
is how to pave the way as quickly as possible from relations of 
neighbors to relations of very good neighbors, and then to 
relations of a friend." It is understandable that it is 
impossible to achieve this in a few days, but we should try to 
achieve it as quickly as possible, the Polish minister pointed 
out. 
  Speaking about Russia's attitude to the problem of Poland 
joining NATO, A. Kozyrev noted that this question had been 
discussed "in a very confidential and realistic way." It is now 
necessary to concentrate on participation in the "Partnership 
for Peace" program, the minister said. There was no ruling out 
one country or another joining NATO. And these countries should 
find their own way to making a decision. It is possible, he 
pointed out, that Russia may join NATO too. But there may also 
be other options. A machinery of interaction of the partners 
has already been created now. This is the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council, A. Kozyrev pointed out.

  [Text] NATO's Partnership for Peace program adopted in 
Brussels at the proposal of the United States has partially 
eased the tension which arose over the intention of several East 
European countries to join the bloc. Our correspondent Marina 
Chernukha asked Valeriy Manilov, deputy secretary of Russia's 
Security Council what consequences this program would have for 
Russia. 
  [Begin Manilov recording] Russia's attitude to this program 
is positive. I have in mind the fact that at no stage 
whatsoever of the implementation of the Partnership for Peace 
program will any steps be taken that will represent a threat to 
Russian security. The NATO bloc will not be expanded to the 
detriment of the interests and security of Russia. In other 
words, states will not be accepted into this organization -- at 
least not in haste. By no means all these states have assessed 
the idea of partnership and by no means all of them have 
approached the idea of partnership from the point of view of 
establishing European security as a whole. 
  The threat arose of the creation of a kind of cordon 
sanitaire close to the borders of Russia. We categorically, 
very toughly and firmly opposed such a turn of events and the 
United States and the NATO leadership have heeded our stance and 
taken account of it. And now, what is at issue -- at the level 
of political cooperation, at the level of expanding economic 
ties, at the level of developing military technical cooperation 
-- is the possibility of various states joining this program 
over a very prolonged period, as they become ready to do so. 
  The specific mechanisms for the implementation of this 
program still have to be devised in detail -- and this is being 
done both in NATO and the United States and in our country. It 
is premature to talk of any state implementing it. Russia is 
ready, in principle, for cooperation and partnership, even more 
so for the sake of peace. We are working to strengthen security 
and peace. On what principles? If we are talking of 
partnership, then on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, 
respect for one another and on no other principles. [end

  [Text] Acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Yuhym Zvyahilskyy 
who arrived on an informal flying visit to Moscow has held one 
hour of private talks with his Russian counterpart Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Russian diplomats in Moscow told INTERFAX. Soon 
after the talks, the Ukrainian official flew out to Kiev to 
continue work as usual. 
  No word was given of the details of the meeting. However, a 
senior Russian diplomat linked Zvyahilskyy's surprise visit to a 
recent stay in Moscow by pro-Moscow Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov. Meshkov had held negotiations with top government and 
parliamentary officials in the Russian capital inviting leading 
economist Yevgeniy Saburov to head the Crimean cabinet of 
ministers. 
  The two sides may have also discussed the Rbl[Rubles] 1 
Tn[trillion] debt Kiev has run for gas imports from Russia by 
the end of January, the diplomat said. Although Russia's chief 
gas exporter, Gazprom, threatened to cut off gas supply to 
Ukraine, it has so far suspended the measure. The diplomat 
believes the two prime ministers may have reached agreement by 
telephone on how to settle the debt and discussed the details on 
Friday.

  [Text] Commander of the Russian long-range nuclear weapons 
General Igor Sergeyev says Moscow is no longer in control of the 
safety of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. 
  In an interview with Interfax on Tuesday, he said that the 
missile troops deployed in Ukraine were no longer under Moscow's 
control after the commanders of the 43rd and 46th missile 
divisions took an oath of allegiance to Kiev. 
  Sergeyev spoke of being unable to control troops "whose 
officers expressed loyalty to another state". He said he 
outlined the emerging situation in letters to Ukrainian and 
Russian Defence Ministers Vitaliy Radetskyy and Pavel Grachev. 
  At the same time, the Russian official pointed to progress 
in 
the negotiations on the pullout of nuclear weapons from Ukraine. 
He said the first batch of nuclear weapons was to be 
transferred to Russia on March 28. 
  Sergeyev said that tension was also running high over the 
nuclear weapons deployed in Kazakhstan whose leadership 
prevented the transfer of weapons to Russia and opposed the plan 
for taking obsolete missiles off combat duty. Sergeyev says the 
dismantling of those missiles should have been started in 1993 
but nothing has so far happened. 
  In his words, Moscow has no problems with the servicing or 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons deployed in Belarus. "These have 
remained under our jurisdiction", said the general. He also 
said that one of the three missile divisions deployed in Belarus 
had been pulled out and disbanded as scheduled. 
  The two remaining divisions are to be withdrawn and 
demobilized in the first half of 1996. Sergeyev says the 
withdrawal process will taken in stages: four regiments will be 
withdrawn in 1994 and the other four a year later. This will 
bring an end to the pullout of nuclear weapons from Belarus. 
The two divisions are to be disbanded in the first half of 1996. 
  Sergeyev says that his troops' combat readiness is just as 
high as in the period of stagnation in the former Soviet Union 
when military supplies were good. In his words, the withdrawal 
of obsolete missiles were being carried out as scheduled.

  [Text] Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev was in Moscow on 
a visit. His meeting with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin took 
place in the Kremlin. Among the matters discussed was a 
proposal for resolving the problem of the emigration of the 
Russian-speaking population from the republic. Akayev put 
forward an initiative to conclude an agreement on the protection 
of the ethnic minorities within the framework of CIS. In the 
afternoon Kyrgyzstan's president held a news conference. It was 
attended by our correspondent Roman Babyan. 
  [Babayan] At the meeting with journalists, Askar Akayev 
stated that many problems now facing the new sovereign states 
have been brought about by the disintegration of the USSR, 
including the problem of the non-native population, such as the 
Russian-speaking population in these states. The Kyrgyz leader 
said the emigration of the Russophone population from the CIS 
countries to their historic homeland has reached a critical 
dimension. Akayev voiced his concern about the outflow of 
Russian speakers from Kyrgyzstan. Of late, some 100,000 people 
had left the republic. Among the reasons causing the Russophone 
population to emigrate from the CIS countries and, in particular 
from Kyrgyzstan, Askar Akayev noted the following: the language 
problem, the socio-economic problem, and the so called 
discomfort problem connected with interethnic conflicts. 
Speaking of the specific measures being taken by the Kyrgyzstan 
leadership to contain emigration, Askar Akayev said in 
particular: 
  [Begin Akayev recording] We are doing everything to preserve 
the role and place of the Russian language in Kyrgyzstan. We 
have preserved teaching in the Russian language in schools, 
institutions of higher learning, the training of specialists in 
Russian philology in the same volume as existed prior to 1990. 
We have opened the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavonic University, the 
first in our region and indeed perhaps the only one in the CIS 
countries, which will become the center of Russian culture, so 
as to impart promise to them, so that they will have confidence 
and not tackle the problem by emigrating. [end recording] 
  [Babayan] Continuing, Kyrgyzstan's president called on all 
leaders of the CIS countries to pool their efforts and to take 
all necessary measures to contain emigration flows.

  [Text] The forthcoming unification of Russia's and Belarus' 
monetary systems on a mutually beneficial basis requires 
development of a precise mechanism to implement bilateral 
agreements, Russia's Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin 
declared in his interview with journalists on Tuesday [22 
February]. He pointed out that experts of both countries are 
currently working out such a mechanism. 
  In Shokhin's words, the parties have actually reached an 
agreement to establish a 1:3 correlation between Russian rubles 
and the Belarusian currency. He explained the mechanism used 
for determining this exchange rate, namely by putting together 
the exchange rate and the rate based on the purchasing ability 
via the consumer basket. The fist one (the exchange rate) is 
1:4 and the second is 1:2.5. Shokhin noted that there exists an 
intention to set different cash and non-cash rates, to make it 
softer for the population and tougher for enterprises. 
  According to Shokhin, the issue of the time-frame for the 
agreement is still being debated. The Belarusian side, which 
wants to receive an access to Russian resources as soon as 
possible, advocates simultaneous implementation of agreements. 
Russia stands for a gradual one, in the course of half a year 
during which a state-by-stage reduction in customs tariffs will 
take place. 
  The minister pointed out that Russia and Belarus had made a 
preliminary conclusion at the inter-state level stating that the 
reached agreements must be ratified by both states' parliaments. 
"It means that Russia should so thoroughly develop all aspects 
of the accords that everybody can understand that it does not 
loose but also gains from the unification of two monetary 
systems," emphasized Shokhin. 
  In his words, advantages gained by Russia include solution 
of 
transit problems and direct access to Europe. This would help 
to solve the problem of Russian oil export not by means of 
inefficient rail way shipments but by means of an oil pipeline 
laid to Polotsk and Mozyr (Belarus) and then further to Europe. 
  Shokhin said that 90 percent of Belarusian industry works 
for 
the Russian market which is why lowering prices for fuel and 
energy resources would help to lower prices for goods imported 
from Belarus.

  [Text] Moscow February 22 TASS -- Legalization of ethnic 
discrimination in Latvia "becomes a prime concern of the Russian 
president, the government and the public," says a letter of 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Latvian leader Guntis Ulmanis. 
  The letter was passed over on Monday [21 February] by the 
Russian ambassador to Riga, sources at the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's press and information department told ITAR-TASS here 
today. 
  The Russian president stressed the priority of settlement of 
the citizenship problem in Latvia with a bilateral agreement. 
In his words, integration of ethnic Russians with public life 
of the independent Latvian Republic would open up a new chapter 
in relations with Latvia, "with which Russia is connected with 
thousands of ties and wants to have good-neighbourly relations 
and mutually beneficial relationship". 
  According to the letter, the Russian and Latvian delegations 
are working to achieve progress in the elaboration of a treaty 
on Russian troops withdrawal, agreements on social protection of 
Russian servicemen, military pensioners and members of their 
families, as well as on the Russian radar station in Skrunda. 
  The signing of these documents would boost settlement of 
other complicated issues of bilateral relations, stressed the 
president's letter.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Korolev: "The Prospect of International </F>
Inspections on DPRK Nuclear Facilities" from the "Today's World" 
program] 
  [Text] The final date -- 21 February -- when the DPRK has 
to give a clear answer on allowing an international inspection 
team to enter its nuclear facilities is approaching. 
  The problem lies in Washington's strict demand and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] asking Pyongyang to 
open the two facilities suspected of secretly developing nuclear 
weapons. 
  The future of the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks depends on 
the DPRK leaders' attitude toward this problem. Issues related 
to normalizing the two countries relations should be discussed 
in the talks. 
  Considering all the facts, it is of most concern that 
Pyongyang positively resolve the issue for economic reasons. 
Judging from the result of the past two rounds of talks, the 
DPRK seems to be well prepared for IAEA inspections of all 
nuclear facilities. 
  In the talks with the IAEA held in Vienna concerning the 
dispute of the details of inspections, it was agreed that two 
important facilities in the DPRK territory would not be taken 
into account [kaman haji anta]. 
  According to data in possession [kajigo innun charyo], 
weapon 
[word indistinct] needed for nuclear warheads could be produced 
at these facilities. It is worrisome [pulan hada] how Pyongyang 
will answer Washington and the IAEA. 
  It is clear that the situation in the region would be 
aggravated if DPRK does not change its attitude on the nuclear 
issue. This is because Washington, Tokyo, and some other 
countries insist that a series of sanctions be imposed on the 
DPRK. They could also bomb [pokkyok halsudo itta] the nuclear 
facilities in the DPRK. 
  On the other hand, other countries oppose such hard-line 
measures. Russia insists on the early resolution of the nuclear 
weapons issue on the Korean peninsula, constructive dialogue 
between parties concerned, and effective cooperation between the 
DPRK and the IAEA.

  [Text] Moscow February 21 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Aleksandr Panov expressed surprise at Saturday's 
publication by the Japanese newspaper MAINICHI SHIMBUN claiming 
that Japan and the United States have been trying out secret 
scenarios of invasion of Russia's maritime territory during 
their joint war games since 1985. 
  "It is hard to say anything about the trustworthiness of the 
Japanese publication," Panov told ITAR-TASS on Monday. He 
believes the situation could be cleared out by Japanese Foreign 
Ministry experts who are participating in the Russian-Japanese 
talks at the level of deputy foreign ministers in Moscow. 
  "In any event, the report confirms the correctness of the 
Russian position that the time has long been ripe for the 
Russian and the Japanese military to meet, exchange information 
and discuss the existing problems," Panov said. 
  Japanese Ambassador to Russia Kozo Watanabe who is also 
attending the talks said that he had not read the article 
carried by MAINICHI SHIMBUN and thus cannot comment on it. As 
for Japanese-American joint military manoeuvres, they are of a 
purely defensive nature and do not go beyond the concept of 
defence sufficiency, he said.

for a dialogue on international and regional issues, including 
in the military sphere, and want the talks to be held at a 
higher level," a Russian top diplomat said after the first day 
of Russian-Japanese consultations in Moscow on Monday.

everything goes pretty smoothly," Nikolay Solovyov added.

Minister Aleksandr Panov, his Japanese counterpart Hiroshi 
Fukuda heads the Japanese delegation. 
  Fukuda said Tokyo is ready to continue support for Russia's 
economic reform and called for expanding trade and cooperation 
in the sphere of investments between the two countries,

  The sides also agreed to seek to boost humanitarian 
exchanges, considering them as an integral part of 
Russian-Japanese relations.

  [Text] Moscow February 22 TASS -- A mixed Russo-Japanese 
group met today to discuss prospects for signing a peace treaty 
between the two countries. 
  "We are satisfied with the dialogue," the leader of the 
Russian delegation to the talks, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Panov told the press on Tuesday morning the 
consultations have confirmed Japan's support for Russian 
reforms. The process is already underway of turning the Group 
of Seven into a group of eight by admitting Russia to the club 
of the world's strongest powers. Japan has also showed a full 
understanding of the need to help the United Nations in solving 
international problems, Panov said. 
  As concerns the peace treaty between Russia and Japan, the 
Russian deputy minister said it was necessary to "set the scene" 
for a favourable dialogue on this subject. To facilitate the 
creation of a favourable atmosphere, the two delegations decided 
not to emphasize the territorial issue at their Tuesday meeting. 
  Panov said a decision is due to be reached on Tuesday on the 
date of the Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's visit to 
Moscow.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 21 TASS -- Scenarios of an armed 
attack on the Russian Far East which were simulated at joint 
U.S.-Japanese command and staff exercises, do not threaten the 
security and national interests of the Russian Federation, 
although they are a relapse of the Cold War, said on Monday 
representatives of the Russian chief naval staff. 
  They commented on an article in Sunday's Japanese newspaper 
MAINICHI that the United States and Japan conducted exercises 
codenamed C-1, C-2 and C-3, during which representatives of the 
Pentagon and the Japanese Defence Agency annually drafted plans 
for invading the Russian Maritime Territory, the South Kurils 
and Sakhalin. 
  In the opinion of Russian experts, the article does not 
reflect present-day realities. The world has changed, as has 
the nature of relations between countries. For instance, Russia 
and the United States will stage a joint exercise with beaching 
a landing party. 
  Russian-Japanese contacts have also become more active. They 
became more open and trustworthy. 
  Russia has adequate forces to protect its Far East both from 
land and sea, representatives of the Russian chief naval staff 
claimed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Delhi, 19 Feb -- Russia has an interest in 
maintaining stability in the Indian Ocean area to prevent 
regional conflicts here, Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in 
chief of the Russian Navy said today at the end of his visit to 
India, in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He held 
talks in Delhi with the Indian Republic's Naval Commander 
Admiral V.S. Shekhawat, was received by Defense Minister M. 
Mallikarjun, visited naval bases in Vishakhapatnam and Bombay, 
and also visited a warship. 
  It is no secret that in the past two years the level of 
military-technical cooperation between Russia and India has seen 
a decline and that the rupture of economic links between the 
countries of the CIS and the transfer to a new system of 
interstate calculations account for much of this, Gromov said. 
Therefore, the talks and meetings that have been held here have 
centered on problems connected to the resumption of bilateral 
ties on the basis of agreements arrived at during Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India in January 1993. These 
documents are now being qualitatively implemented where they 
relate to military-technical cooperation, in particular in 
weaponry matters and orders for spare parts, mechanisms, and 
materials. Furthermore, there are opportunities for organizing 
the exchange of experience in the tactics of the art of war and 
in personnel training. 
  The Russian military leader expressed hope that the creation 
in Moscow of Rosvooruzheniye with the aim of settling all 
matters from the sale of arms through to their technical 
servicing and use in one package would provide for the smooth 
functioning of deliveries. We have taken it upon ourselves to 
work more closely with this new structure in order to meet our 
obligations to India, he said. 
  The commander in chief praised the level of maintenance at 
Indian bases, ships, and training equipment and the training of 
servicemen. All categories without exception -- from admiral to 
sailor -- display a conscientious attitude to the fulfillment of 
their duties. There are elements that we could adopt during the 
transition to the construction of Russia's Armed Forces on a 
new, professional basis. 
  The entry into Bombay of a detachment of the Russian Pacific 
Fleet consisting of the large Admiral Vinogradov antisubmarine 
vessel, the large Admiral Vilkov landing vessel and the Viktor 
Kolechitskiy tanker was timed to coincide with Gromov's visit. 
By agreement with the command of India's Navy, the first 
Russian-Indian exercises since the dissolution of the USSR were 
held in the Arabian Sea, during the course of which, according 
to the admiral, individual elements of military activity were 
tested: The establishment of communications, joint maneuvers, 
work with aerial and underwater targets, and the use of 
helicopters. A decision was made to conduct similar maneuvers 
in the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Suleyman Demirel, president of Turkey, by </F>
Dmitriy Kulik, date not given: "Suleyman Demirel: `I Have 
Elevated Democracy to the Level of Poetry'" -- first three 
paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Ankara -- Suleyman Demirel is well known throughout 
the world today. He has been elected prime minister seven 
times, twice he has been ousted by the military, but history 
restores everything to its rightful place and last year he 
became president of our neighbor, Turkey. 
  His path to the top was as long and arduous as Turkey's path 
to democracy and economic prosperity. The irony is that it is 
his name specifically which for millions of Turks is synonymous 
with democracy (although Demirel translated means "iron hand"). 
  His residence today is the sumptuous "Pink House" (that is 
the nickname given to the president's palace because of the 
gaudy color of the stone with which it is finished). It is 
difficult to gain access to this building even for local 
journalists -- he has no time for interviews. However he made 
an exception for us -- Demirel has always paid close attention 
to Russia and, as it turned out, he knows our newspaper well. 
  [Kulik] The leaders of many former republics of the USSR 
regard Turkey not only as an "older brother" who will help them 
in difficult times but also as a "father," in the belief that he 
will not only bring up his poor children but will also give them 
a start in "adult life." Do people in those countries not 
overexaggerate the role of Turkey, which has a host of economic 
problems of its own, a complex political situation, and vast 
debts? 
  [Demirel] We consider it our political and moral duty to 
help the newly independent Turkic republics to strengthen their 
statehood, overcome their economic problems, and enter the 
market. 
  Our relations are based on equality of rights. That is why 
there is no question of an "older" or "younger brother." Turkey 
has signed more than 200 agreements with those countries in the 
spheres of the economy, culture, education, communications, 
transport, technical assistance, and banking. Ankara has 
granted credits totaling $935 million. In all, taken together 
with humanitarian and technical assistance, these countries have 
received $1,200 million. 
  Last year and already this year around 10,000 students from 
the Central Asian republics and Azerbaijan have come to Turkey 
to study thanks to an "educational link program" that has been 
devised. 
  We are also cooperating in air transport. Flights, including 
charter flights, have begun between Baku, Tashkent, Bishkek, 
Almaty, Ashgabat, and Istanbul. We have given those countries 
technical help to improve radio and satellite communications. 
They will now be able to link up with the rest of the world via 
Turkey. 
  [Kulik] The creation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
[BSEC] organization was received with great enthusiasm, 
although with the passage of time interest in this organization 
has gradually begun to wane. Does this mean that the BSEC has 
not lived up to the hopes of politicians and businessmen? What 
specifically is Turkey doing to develop regional cooperation? 
  [Demirel] I do not share the view that interest in the BSEC 
has waned. It is working fully -- which is confirmed by the 
number of joint decisions and technical meetings. 
  Moreover, the interest of third parties can be confirmed by 
the increase in the number of requests for "observer status" 
from various states or nongovernmental organizations. As you 
already know, I am sure, Poland, Tunisia, Israel, Slovakia, and 
Egypt have already been given that status within the BSEC. The 
same status has been given to the organization's council created 
by commercial associations from the member countries. The 
International Black Sea Club has been created. The progress 
achieved with the framework of the BSEC may be considered 
outstanding. Its structural organization has been completed and 
the transition to the level of implementing specific projects 
has been made. Cooperation in the telecommunications sphere is 
developing particulary actively. 
  [Kulik] Islamic fundamentalism is worrying the whole world 
today. Does that problem exist in Turkey? How do you regard it? 
  [Demirel] To be frank, it is hard to understand how world 
publc opinion can be worried about the activation of Islamic 
fundamentalism. After all, in former Yugoslavia and especially 
on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina it is the Muslims who 
have been subjected to attack. It is they essentially who are 
suffering genocide. More than 1 million people in Azerbaijan 
have become refugees in their own country. And it is against 
that background that the whole world is for some reason talking 
about Islamic fundamentalism. 
  On the contrary, it is the Muslims who are presently in a 
defensive position. That must be clearly seen. 
  Islamic fundamentalism in the eighties was a kind of 
reaction 
by the populations of various Muslim countries to the lack of 
democracy and to pressure from the authoriies. But if we look 
at things from today's perspective, we will see that even the 
most radical Islamic tendencies of that period which entered the 
leadership of certain countries have substantially moderated 
their position. 
  In the nineties the situation began to develop differently. 
A new world order is being formed in the process of which a 
host of problems which have accumulated since World War I have 
surfaced. In such an uncertain atmosphere, religiosity, 
micronationalism, a hostile attitude to foreigners, and other 
harmful tendencies have begun to prevail in various regions. It 
is because the world community did not prevent them in time that 
we now have the present situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  There is no need to speak of fundamentalism in Turkey: We 
do not have such a problem. Yes, of course, there are 
individual fundamentalists or fairly small and uninfluential 
groups of that kind. But you can encounter that anywhere in the 
world. But the overwhelming majority of Turks are implacable 
toward fundamentalism. The fact is that Turkey has quite 
considerable experience in the sphere of democracy and law -- we 
have accepted them as a way of life.... Go out into the streets 
and talk with Turks there and you will see that for yourself. 
  [Kulik] Last year Turkish officials were heard to say a 
number of times that the "Kurdish Workers' Party [PKK] would be 
finished off before 1994." Indeed, Ankara did conduct a number 
of successful operations against Kurdish militants both in 
Turkey itself and in Europe. However, the strength of the PKK 
has not diminished, the struggle goes on, and people continue to 
die. Do you still believe that this organization must be fought 
by strong-arm methods alone? What is the way out of the present 
situation? 
  [Demirel] I do not believe that anyone said: "The PKK will 
be finished off...." I am sure that they were talking about an 
effective and successful campaign against that terrorist 
organization and the weakening of it, which has been achieved. 
  Turkey is constantly trying to resolve this problem on the 
basis of the norms of a democratic, rule-of-law state. We are 
opposed to the destruction of the country and our villages, 
attacks on border posts and police stations, and the murder of 
people, indiscriminate murder furthermore -- of children, women, 
men, civilians or military, young or old. And Turkey's measures 
in response to all this are constitutional: We are protecing 
our democratic regime by the methods of that democratic regime. 
I do not think that there are any other means of combatting 
terrorism. 
  It would be a mistake to think that it is only people of 
Kurdish origin who are members of the terrorist PKK. In Turkey 
all people are "first class" citizens. Incidentally, there are 
more Kurds in western Turkey than in the southeast (that is 
where the war against the PKK is particularly fierce -- author's 
note). They live as they please and where they please, they 
work where they want to work. And our task is to protect them 
from the PKK, a terrorist organzation which engages in 
racketeering, drug smuggling, and other illegal activity. 
  [Kulik] The Cold War has ended, but Turkey retains its 
former military concept and there are NATO basis still on its 
territory. Do you think that it is still necessary to preserve 
this situation? 
  [Demirel] I do not believe that there is any reason to fear 
this in Moscow. There is an agreement on friendship and 
cooperation between Russia and Turkey which I myself signed in 
1992. 
  [Kulik] Since you have raised the subject, incidentally, do 
you not rule out cooperation in the military sphere? 
  [Demirel] Turkey is a part of NATO. If that organization's 
policy and doctrine allow such cooperation then of course it is 
possible. But we are already collaborating in the military 
sphere by buying your military hardware. There are 
consultations between our generals, the Russian defense minister 
has visited Turkey.... 
  Russia is no longer our enemy. We have formed good 
relations. 
  [Kulik] Sometimes the Turkish reforms are called almost an 
"economic miracle." There is also an opinion that it was only 
the army, when it held power in Turkey, which ensured stability 
and prepared the ground for successful political and economic 
transformations. As a president and a politican who has 
suffered from the army a number of times, what do you think 
about that? 
  [Demirel] The involvement of the military in politics is the 
oldest thing in the world. But sooner or later people always 
come to the conclusion that power must be civilian. Where the 
army is under the leadership of civilians, there you get 
democracy. Where the military run everything, there you get 
fascism. 
  The army cannot prepare the country for democracy. The 
people must prepare themselves for democracy which cannot 
develop "in silence." That is why I shall never agree with the 
leading role of the army in reforms. 
  [Kulik] How do you view the results of the parliamentary 
elections in Russia? Will they influence Russian-Turkish 
relations? 
  [Demirel] The elections in Russia are, of course, entirely 
Russia's domestic affair. They are a reflection of the Russian 
people's political will. These were the first free elections in 
Russia and approved the new post-communist constitution. I am 
confident that the process of reforms, which are so tumultuous 
in your country, will continue. 
  As for our bilateral relations, I would like to note that we 
perceive Mr. Zhirinovskiy's statements with apprehension. 
However, we do not believe that the many centuries old 
Russian-Turkish relations can be swayed by such utterances. 
  [Kulik] You are a well-known politician of world stature. 
Much is said and written about you. But how would Suleyman 
Demirel describe himself -- as a man and a citizen? 
  [Demirel] I have been serving my state and my people for 40 
years now, first as a technocrat, then as a politician. I first 
became involved in political activity to establish the supremacy 
of the people's will because my ideal was that of a happy, 
prosperous, and democratic Turkey built "from scratch." I am 
constantly working to achieve that ideal today. 
  I have elevated democracy to the level of my own poetry and 
I 
have always fought for it even at the most difficult times. I 
derive my determination here from the determination of the 
Turkish people. 
  If you look at the past 30 years of the Turkish Republic, 
you 
will see that the people have always been with me. I believe 
that I worked quite hard to ensable us to achieve the level of 
democracy and economic strength that we have today. 
  Of course, only the people can assess politicans and their 
actions. That is why I feel pride in and admiration for our 
people who have always rendered me my due.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] "Russia is not quite satisfied" with the rules for 
the passage of ships through the Black Sea straits, Bosporus and 
Dardanelles, established by Turkey early this year. A Russian 
delegation led by the First Deputy Director of the Foreign 
Ministry's legal department, Yakov Ostrovskiy, left for Ankara 
on Monday to discuss this problem. Interfax learned this from a 
high-ranking Russian diplomat in charge of relations with Turkey. 
  The passage of ships through the Black Sea straits is 
regulated by the Montreux Convention signed in 1938 by the USSR, 
Turkey and some other countries, he explained. "Provisions of 
that convention satisfy Russia. As for Ankara, while 
proclaiming its adherence to the convention verbally, in fact it 
interprets the document rather freely," the diplomat said. 
  The new Turkish rules, he explained, stipulate that the 
ships 
passing through the straits must necessarily be accompanied by 
pilots (Interfax's note: under the convention pilots can be 
used only with the captains' consent). 
  Moreover, Interfax's interviewee noted, Turkey's provision 
that large ships must pass through Bosporus strictly in their 
turn "is not quite in line" with the convention. "Under the new 
Turkish rules, when a large ship enters the strait, the 
remaining ones must wait. This creates numerous 
inconveniences," the Russian diplomat said. 
  Turkey established "a very complicated procedure" for the 
passage of nuclear-armed ships, he pointed out. Preliminary 
notifications and the observance of some other formalities are 
required for the passage of such ships. "This is understandable. 
Istanbul is a city populated by 12 million people, and any 
accident may result in great casualties. Nevertheless we 
believe, and our view is shared by many Turks, that such issues 
should be resolved in the framework of an international 
conference. Such a conference may be convened in the near 
future," the diplomat concluded.

endorsed as a single package, including a resolution on an 
amnesty for those who took part in the events of August 1991, 1 
May 1993, and September-October 1994. 
  Some deputies, in particular from the Agrarian faction, the

  [Text] The head of the press office of the Ukrainian State 
Committee for Oil and Gas, Stepan Yalovega, has confirmed that 
Turkmenistan cut off deliveries of its natural gas to Ukraine. 
At the same time, he told Interfax-Ukraine that Russia 
continued to supply Ukraine with gas. 
  According to Yalovega, Ukrainian consumers "have nothing 
special to worry about, for the republic's facilities store gas 
in sufficient quantities which would last until the end of the 
heating season." 
  Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Valentin Landyk told a press 
conference in Kiev today that Ukraine will send 60,000 tons of 
grain to Turkmenistan to reimburse part of its debt for Turkmen 
gas that he estimated at $150 Mn. However, Turkmenistan 
believes that the debt has already reached $700 Mn. 
  Landyk added that a telephone conversation between acting 
Ukrainian Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy and the Turkmen 
leadership failed to help resume the deliveries. 
  In 1993, Ukraine received 25.5 Bn cubic meters of gas from 
Turkmenistan and another 69 Bn cubic meters from Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Mircea Snegur by Romanian Radio </F>
Broadcasting Company Director General Eugen Preda in Chisinau on 
22 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Preda] It is Tuesday, 22 February, 1234 [1034 GMT]. 
We are in the office of the president of the Republic of 
Moldova, Mircea Snegur, who was kind enough to receive us for an 
interview intended for the Actualitati [Current Events] program 
of Radio Romania. 
  Mr. President, this is the third time you honor me by 
personally granting me an interview. I recall that on 28 July 
1991 you gave me the first. Please, allow me to quote a passage 
from the end of that interview: To the listeners of Radio 
Romania, whom I esteem very much, today, on the 28th of July 
1991, I would like to again wish you much health, happiness, and 
success. Let us remember that we are relatives, we have common 
roots. Let us hope that, by the joint actions we are 
undertaking with the Romanian party, our history will reach a 
peak in our development. Success, good luck, happiness, and let 
us cultivate our kinship. I conclude the quote. 
  A long period of time has elapsed since then. Would you be 
so kind and continue the idea you expressed then and anchor it 
to the current moment? 
  [Snegur] Of course, a great deal of time has elapsed since 
that moment, but in principle, in that context, my way of 
thinking has not changed, and if you remember, during our recent 
[5 February] congress titled "Our Home, the Republic of Moldova" 
the same things were reiterated related to our history and 
descent, as well as the need to maintain our ties and to 
cultivate our kinship, as I said at that time. Thus, in 
principle, the main idea calling for us to cultivate our ties as 
relatives remains valid. 
  However, I can also see the reason behind your question 
referring especially to that issue, and that is, I believe, the 
anti-Snegur campaign launched in the Romanian press following 
the aforementioned congress, Our Home, the Republic of Moldova. 
In connection with this I would like to point out that our 
policy is a sensible one in all domains, and it is being 
permanently adapted to the reality in the Republic of Moldova 
and to the people's wish to strengthen the state character of 
our country, to develop as an independent state, and to preserve 
our territorial integrity. At the same time, within the very 
same policy, the principal directions regarding the spiritual 
and economic integration of the Republic of Moldova with Romania 
have remained unaltered. 
  [Preda] I would like to ask you a question regarding the 
Ilascu case. What is your current assessment of that case? 
  [Snegur] Related to the Ilascu case I would like to say that 
I prefer to act, rather than talk about it, so that my 
intentions and hopes are still the same, namely that we will 
manage to transfer those political prisoners to the 
constitutional juridical bodies of the Republic of Moldova. We 
have taken measures to that end, and we have also asked for the 
support of those who can influence the mentality of the Tiraspol 
secessionist leaders. To that purpose I do not find it 
embarrassing and I do not try to avoid to meet and engage in 
dialogues, regardless of whether they are direct ones or not, 
with the Tiraspol authorities. As a matter of fact, yesterday a 
number of [Moldovan] officials held talks there on the holding 
of the [27 February] general elections in that region as well, 
and on the need to maintain our economic and other ties. During 
those talks, they again approached that issue [the Ilascu case]. 
As a result of our efforts, the Dniester leaders, Grigore 
Maracuta, for instance, made a number of declarations stating 
that they would revise the [death] sentence and adopt different 
decisions. I optimistically assess that the problem will be 
solved in the end. 
  [Preda] Recently the inter-ministerial commission met in 
Bucharest. I understand that both Bucharest and Chisinau assess 
its activity positively. What are your views regarding our 
bilateral cooperation? 
  [Snegur] I consider that our prospects are very good, 
because if one draws a balance of our ties and our actions 
undertaken last year, in 1993, one can see that a number of new 
measures and concrete directions were decided upon to enhance 
our bilateral, mutually advantageous economic cooperation. I am 
pleased to mention that, during the meeting, you mentioned they 
did not talk about politics, but rather about the concrete 
problems that ought to be solved by the inter-ministerial 
commission. This is a thing that encourages us in a certain 
way. We maintain our former position, namely that the 
establishment of concrete ties between our companies ought to be 
boosted and speeded up, and the commission is able to set up a 
certain framework promoting such ties. 
  I was briefed on the meeting thanks to you -- as you carried 
ample reports both on radio and television -- but, of course I 
was also briefed here, at home, by the head of our delegation, 
and I found that their meeting was a positive and encouraging 
one. 
  [Preda] Mr. President, the inter-ministerial meeting 
established a kind of a schedule with respect to various 
contacts. According to that schedule, this year the prime 
ministers are to meet twice, plus the two meetings of the 
inter-ministerial commission. This means that a meeting will 
take place in each quarter. Do you expect other meetings as 
well, perhaps at an even higher level? 
  [Snegur] In my opinion, the good understanding between us 
and our ties make it possible for us to meet at any time. It is 
true that the meetings we held over the past years had been 
planned and the agendas had been worked out well in advance, but 
whenever problems arise, Mr. President Ion Iliescu and I contact 
each other over the telephone and if we decide to see each other 
we meet and discuss those problems. Lately the issue of holding 
a meeting did not occur to us, but I think that a meeting at the 
highest level cannot be excluded. 
  [Preda] I would like to thank you very much and, in 
conclusion, perhaps you would like to address a few words to our 
listeners in Romania. 
  [Snegur] All right, I will do that. All I can say is that 
next time we will [words indistinct] such good wishes. This is 
welcome because a certain continuity is needed, but please 
believe me that I am making efforts to promote a consequent 
policy. 
  My best wishes to the radio listeners. May this year bring 
rain and peace. I wish that in Romania work will continue to 
further the economic reform. Thus Romania would advance a 
little bit in the promotion of the reforms. Thus we will also 
have the possibility to examine and turn to good account the 
good things they do, but also learn from certain mistakes that 
are made. We admire and watch with satisfaction the 
democratization processes in Romania and, as a result of this, 
you will be witnessing multiparty elections [on 27 February]. 
[passage indistinct] I hope that this will be a fruitful year 
in results and that the harvest will be good, which will raise 
the standard of living of the population. 
  I wish you much health and happiness. 
  [Preda] Thank you.

statement against the maintenance of the Skrunda radar station 
in Latvia for another five and a half years. This was announced 
today at a news conference by Baiba Petersone, deputy chairman 
of the LNNK board. 
  The Union of National Forces calls on the Latvian government 
delegation, the Saeima, and the state president not to accept a 
treaty with Russia if it even partly legitimizes Russia's 
military presence in Latvia. Otherwise, the statement says, the 
Union of National Forces envisages using the forms of direct 
democracy and the experience of non-violent resistance until the 
full withdrawal of a foreign country's troops.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Triumph of a `Package Method'"] </F>
  [Text] According to "Yabloko" deputy Vyacheslav 
Shostakovskiy, following a protracted discussion yesterday the 
State Duma Council decided to merge into one package two issues 
that have lately caused the deepest divisions between factions: 
on a wide-ranging amnesty and on setting up a commission to 
investigate the events of September-October 1993 in Moscow. 
Leaders of conservative factions, who have up to now demanded 
that the commission be vested with the broadest powers possible, 
agreed to persuade their deputies to refrain altogether from 
intervening in the investigation conducted by the prosecutor's 
office, and to act as if the vote on setting up a commission 
never took place. Their political rivals agreed in response to 
add a number of "political" provisions to the amnesty decree. 
The decision on the "purely criminal" amnesty, however, will 
still be made separately from decisions on the "political and 
economic" amnesty. Another participant in the meeting, however, 
told SEGODNYA that "A political amnesty does not mean at all 
that all those charged with organizing rebellions in 1991 and 
1993 and the instigators of last May's disturbances will be 
pardoned at once."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Palariya] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 23 Feb -- The U.S. Government has brought 
charges against CIA employee Aldrich Ames and his wife Maria 
Ames, accusing them of spying for the former Soviet Union and 
then Russia. The U.S. Justice Department said that Ames and his 
wife were arrested on Monday during a joint operation conducted 
by the CIA and the FBI. According to the information of the 
Justice Department, the Ames had been spying against the United 
States since 1985 and had received more than $1.5 million for 
that, which they deposited in bank accounts in the United States 
and abroad. 
  Yuriy Kobaladze, head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service press office, whom an ITAR-TASS correspondent contacted 
by telephone this morning, declined to comment on the case of 
the arrest of the U.S. couple accused of spying for Russia. 
However, he remarked that "this question should be put, rather, 
to the CIA." 
  At the same time it seems that there's no point in blowing 
up 
a political scandal out of this episode. After all, even in a 
changing world, intelligence remains intelligence with the 
specific means and interests that are peculiar to it. 
Incidentally, the leadership of the United States and other 
Western countries have confirmed on several occasions that they 
have no intention of curtailing intelligence activity against 
Russia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>
  [Text] Washington February 23 TASS -- The U.S. Government 
instituted judicial proceedings against Aldrich Ames, the former 
chief of the CIA's Soviet Counterintelligence Branch, and his 
wife Maria, charging them with spying for the former Soviet 
Union and then Russia, according to a U.S. Justice Department 
statement circulated on Tuesday [22 February]. 
  Ames, 52, a CIA employee for more than 31 years, and his 
wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, 41, a Colombian-born 
naturalised U.S. citizen, were arrested on Monday during an 
operation carried out jointly by CIA and FBI agents. 
  According to the Department of Justice, the Ames couple have 
been spying against the U.S. since 1985 and received more than 
1.5 million U.S. dollars in payoff money and deposited the money 
on accounts in U.S. and foreign banks. 
  "It is a very serious case," President Bill Clinton told 
journalists in the White House on Tuesday. When asked whether 
the cold war is over or not, Mr Clinton declined comment, 
pointing out that the matter would be tackled in the coming days. 
  White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said at a briefing on 
the same day that an Ames case probe had been launched ten 
months before and that the president had been kept informed of 
it from the very outset. 
  Ms Myers said the president instructed the Department of 
State to lodge an official protest with the government of 
Russia. Secretary of State Warren Christopher summoned charge 
d'affaires ad interim of Russia while U.S. Ambassador in Russia 
Thomas Pickering had a meeting with senior Russian officials. 
  The White House press secretary said National Security 
Adviser Anthony Lake and CIA Director James Woolsey had been 
ordered to lead a "coordinated examination of the national 
security implications of this case". 
  "We take this very seriously. We do not like it one bit," 
Myers told reporters. 
  "We are having very serious, very forthright discussions 
with 
the Russians, both in Washington and Moscow, about this 
incident... I think in terms of future relationship, we are 
having those conversations now and we shall just let those take 
place and see what goes", Ms Myers said.

  [Text] On Tuesday [22 February] Anatoliy Adamishin, 
Russia's first deputy foreign minister, reconfirmed to INTERFAX 
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's proposal to hold a 
special summit of Russian, American, French, British, and German 
leaders to solve the Bosnian issue remains in force. 
  Adamishin pointed out that the pull-out of heavy artillery 
and other arms from Sarajevo by Serbs and Muslims means "a 
serious breakthrough reached by political means." "Now it is 
important to fasten this initial success," he said. 
  In Adamishin's words, Russia has a concrete program for 
further actions. "It provides for final demilitarization of 
Sarajevo. It can be fixed by the transfer of the city to UN 
interim administration as was foreseen almost in all the plans 
for a settlement," he said. 
  "Solution of several other painful problems in Bosnia, 
minding the lessons of the Sarajevo crisis, can become the 
second step," said Adamishin. 
  He emphasized that he does not view the course for "further 
ultimatums as a very productive one." "The events around 
Sarajevo demonstrated that the line of a political settlement of 
the conflict, being pursued by Russia gives the best results. 
But one should not be sure that all kinds of ultimatums won't 
appear every now and then and that Russia will be able to pull 
the situation away from a dead alley, this will not result in 
any settlement," he underlined. 
  Adamishin expressed his dissatisfaction with the version 
being spread now, that "the Serbs had to go along with the NATO 
ultimatum one way or another and that Russia only saved their 
image (face), by asking that they fulfilled not NATO's ultimatum 
but request. Events could have taken another turn and this 
could have led to unexpected consequences," he pointed out. 
  INTERFAX's interlocutor believes that such a method as 
"shout 
and everything will be done" is not the most efficient one in 
diplomacy. "It does not mean that Russia rejects utilization of 
force once and for all. Moscow has agreed that the NATO forces 
in the former Yugoslavia can defend themselves in case of an 
attack against them. There are Russian servicemen in the 
composition of these forces and we cannot leave them armless in 
this sense. The thing is that such decisions should be taken 
cautiously and only along one possible line, namely via the UN 
Security Council," he said. 
  Adamishin spoke in favor of continuation of talks between 
three confronting Bosnian parties. "This is necessary in order 
to solve the Bosnian conflict in complex, though its solution 
has been already reached. But after that Muslims took a step 
back as they believed that they can reach more at the 
battlefield than at the negotiation table, said Adamishin. But 
as we speak about a final political settlement, Russia does not 
rule out that there can be introduced small and final 
corrections into the plan proposed by Lord Owen and Thorwald 
Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the international conference on 
settlement in the former Yugoslavia." 
  As the Bosnian crisis has demonstrated, Adamishin said, the 
West should study "a new science of cooperation more but not 
less than Russia." 
  In his opinion, Russia and the West will "experience periods 
of definite complications because they are getting accustomed to 
the interests of each other." 
  Adamishin said that Russia believes that "inevitable 
difference in interests should be regulated by political means, 
by means of discussion and partnership." "If we are pushed from 
such a way to look for a common denominator in the sphere of 
mutual interests then we shall be forced to search for other 
methods to defend our interests. As a matter of fact, interests 
will no disappear. The West is to take them into consideration 
this way or other," noted Adamishin. 
  He also emphasized that "cooperation with Russia will bring 
greater results for conflicts' solution and establishing 
European security than recurrences of confrontation with Moscow 
reminding of "cold war."

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Georgia and the breakaway 
western region of Abkhazia resumed peace talks here on Tuesday 
under UN auspices with Russian participation, in a third round 
of negotiations which started last October. 
  UN spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said the aim of the two to 
three day session was to achieve an overall settlement. Topping 
the agenda are the return of 200,000 to 300,000 refugees who 
fled Abkhazia in last year's fighting, and a discussion of 
Abkhazia's political status. 
  Under the old Soviet constitution, Abkhazia was an 
autonomous 
republic within Georgia. The speaker of its parliament in 
Sukhumi, Vladislav Ardzinba, told the press here that Abkhazia 
could choose between independence or coexistence in equality 
with Georgia. Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has insisted a 
solution must respect Georgia's territorial integrity. 
  The previous round of talks ended in mid-January with 
agreement in principle on the withdrawal of troops and a 
demilitarisation zone between the belligerents.

  [Text] First Deputy Georgian Foreign Minister, a member of 
the Georgian delegation at the Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations, 
started on February 22 in Geneva, Mikhail Ukleba, said that the 
negotiatory process was very difficult. However, there was hope 
for the future, he added. 
  He mentioned in a televised interview that Head of the 
Georgian delegation, Jaba Ioseliani, had made a statement on the 
'ethnic cleansing' carried out in the Abkhazian region of Ghali. 
Ioseliani also blamed the Abkhazian party for failure of the 
agreements on return of refugees to this region achieved at the 
previous January round of the negotiations. 
  A member of the Abkhazian delegation, Plenipotentiary 
Representative of Abkhazia to the Western Europe, Vyacheslav 
Chirikba, stressed that the negotiations were hampered by the 
categorical and uncompromising statements of the Georgian 
delegation, which impeded the negotiations and adoption of 
constructive decisions." 
  According to him, the Abkhazian party continues to stand for 
deployment of peacekeeping forces on the Georgian-Abkhazian 
border of the Inguri River. The Georgian delegation insisted 
that these forces be brought to Abkhazia to control all its 
territory. 
  Speaking on return of refugees, Chirikba said that the 
Abkhazian delegation had confirmed the preparedness to receive 
all refugees except those who had committed military crimes 
against Abkhazians. 
  Chirikba announced that the parties had put forward their 
proposals on the status of Abkhazia which was to be discussed in 
a few days. 
  The Abkhazian plenipotentiary representative's press service 
told Interfax that three main issues were to be considered in 
Geneva - refugees, the status of Abkhazia and deployment of the 
peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone. 
  The Abkhazian delegation is headed by Abkhazian Premier 
Sokrat Jinjoliya. Deputy Russian Foreign Minister, Boris 
Pastukhov, represents the Russian party.

  [Text] It has emerged that yesterday, the Geneva talks on 
the peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia examined the 
problem of the return of the refugees to their original places 
of residence and Abkhazia's political status. 
  Representatives of leading Western powers present at the 
talks reaffirmed their position as regards Georgia's territorial 
integrity, telling [Abkhaz Supreme Soviet Chairman Vladislav] 
Ardzinba, who had been specially summoned to Geneva, that there 
could be no talk of Abkhazia's secession. 
  The Georgian delegation made a statement strongly condemning 
the Abkhaz separatists' actions against civilians in Gali Rayon. 
The text of the statement was distributed among representatives 
of the mass media. 
  Georgian representatives made special emphasis on the fact 
that the Abkhaz side had blocked a visit to Gali Rayon by the UN 
mission, which was confirmed by its leader, General Hvidegaard. 
  The talks continued today.

  [Text] The U.S. spy case involving the Ames couple who, the 
Americans allege, were working for Moscow since 1985 will 
probably be discussed in detail during the forthcoming visit to 
Washington by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister 
Mamedov. It is expected that the deputy foreign minister, who 
is now visiting a number of Latin American countries, will 
arrive in Washington on 26 February. 
  According to a high-level Russian official, it would be 
possible, if we wanted to, to expose U.S. diplomats and some 
Russians collaborating with these special services working in 
Moscow, but we are not doing this. Just as the Americans were 
not doing this until now. It is not clear why they have to cast 
a shadow on their relations with Russia, which earns the highest 
number of points for Bill Clinton's administration, the 
high-level Russian official stated.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yuriy Kobaldze, head of the Public </F>
Relations Center of Russian External Intelligence; Kobaladze 
speaks in Russian with superimposed English translation; 
Kobaladze remarks recorded] 
  [Text] The United States Government has filed a law suit 
against an officer of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aldrich 
Hazen Ames, and his wife, Maria Ames, on charges of spying for 
the former Soviet Union and then Russia. The United States 
Justice Ministry claims that the Ames couple has spied against 
the United States since 1985. The U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher has lodged an official protest with a Russian 
diplomat who was invited to the Department of State. In Moscow, 
the U.S. Ambassador Pickering voiced a similar protest at his 
meeting with Russian Foreign Ministry officials. Radio Moscow's 
reporter, Aleksandr Peripetchko has asked the chief of the 
Public Relations Bureau of Russia's external intelligence, Yuriy 
Kobaladze, to comment on the arrest of the American couple on 
charges of spying for Russia: 
  [Kobaladze] Firstly, it is unclear for what reason the 
Russian external intelligence is believed to be involved in that 
affair. This question should be addressed to the Americans, 
those who made the arrest, those who formulated the charges, 
U.S. Administration officials. This is not our business. We 
never comment on such issues. This is a generally recognized 
practice for all secret services. The Russian intelligence is 
no exception. No comments are made on whether this or that 
person was, or is, involved in intelligence operations. All 
professionals are perfectly aware of that. So is the public at 
large. This is the reason why I refrain from any comments. 
  [Announcer] A BBC report said that the United States does 
not 
want another round of mutual expulsions, so frequent in the Cold 
War years. Yet it hopes that Russia will recall from the United 
States those diplomats who have worked with the Ames couple. 
Washington would also like to hear promises from Moscow that 
nothing of the sort will happen in the future. What does the 
public relations official of the Russian external intelligence 
think of that? Yuriy Kobaladze: 
  [Kobaladze] If we avoid focusing on this concrete episode 
and 
speak in broader terms, the Russian intelligence has never 
pledged to curtail intelligence activity. No other Western 
intelligence, including the American one, has ever done so 
either. Moreover, Washington keeps saying that in the wake of 
the break-up of the Soviet Union, its interest in Russia's 
problems and in the problems of other former Soviet republics 
has grown and not reduced. The Americans say they must increase 
the presence of the intelligence in that region. They have 
talked a great deal about what they call human intelligence. 
This euphemism means recruiting agents. The American 
intelligence and other foreign secret services have been very 
active in that respect. 
  [Announcer] One of Russia's central dailies, IZVESTIYA, 
earlier this month published an interview with the chief of 
Russia's Federal Counterintelligence, Mr. Golushko. In that 
interview he said outright that several people have been 
arrested on spying charges. The damage one of them has caused to 
Russia is similar only to that of the Penkovskiy affair in the 
60's. This is only one of the examples of how active Western 
secret services have been in Russia. Washington seems to be 
expecting Moscow to take certain steps to restore stability in 
its relations with the United States, the more so since the 
United States President Bill Clinton has described this as a 
very serious incident. Is that so? Yuriy Kobaladze: 
  [Kobaladze] What we would like to say is that individual 
episodes should not be used to build up tensions in Russian-U.S. 
relations. That is a Cold War tactic. If we really live in a 
new world, a world of cooperation and good-neighborliness, it 
would be senseless to fan this hysteria. 
  [Announcer] One cannot but agree that even in this changing 
world, an intelligence service will remain so. It will continue 
to have its own specific interest and use its own means. It 
remains to be seen whether this episode will have a negative 
effect on Russian- U.S. relations or not.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS -- Russian foreign minister 
said the Ames' affair should not be politicized and forefronted 
in Russian-American relations. The problem should be handled by 
people responsible for this specific sphere, who will look into 
particulars, collect comprehensive information and make 
appropriate decisions. 
  The Russian minister was referring to the case of the former 
CIA counter-intelligence department leader Aldrich H. Ames and 
his wife whom the U.S. Administration accused of spying for the 
former Soviet Union and Russia. 
  According to the Russian minister, Russian-American 
relations 
have reached a very high level of partnership and cooperation 
for "cases like this one" to overshadow them. 
  Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, Andrey Kozyrev 
admitted that "espionage stories" do crop up, regrettably, in 
relations between different countries from time to time, even if 
they are NATO allies, or between the United States and Israel. 
  Andrey Kozyrev expressed the hope that the "Ames problem" is 
in no way linked to the Russian president's latest initiative 
concerning Bosnia. It would be better, he said, not to 
politicize or ideologize the situation but let relevant services 
of the two countries handle it. 
  What is most important is for us "to continue cooperation 
and 
not to attach undue, hypertrophied significance to this case", 
Kozyrev said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Parliament Deputy Sergey Stankevich by </F>
presenter Jon Snow from the "Channel 4 News" broadcast; 
Stankevich in Moscow, Snow in London -- live] 
  [Text] [Snow] Well we're joined now from Moscow by Sergey 
Stankevich, who is a member of the Russian parliament and former 
adviser to President Yeltsin. First, Sergey Stankevich, on the 
spying matter, from a Russian perspective, how seriously would 
you assess the strain between America and Russia on this issue? 
  [Stankevich] I think that mutual spying is normal, routine 
practice, not only for totalitarian but also for democratic 
states. I am absolutely sure that we have enough American spies 
now in Moscow, maybe now even more than before, and I see no 
reason to over-dramatize this particular case. I think that if 
we use this case as a ground for revising previous long-term 
agreements and relations between Russia and United States, it 
would bring quite serious damage, not only for our bilateral 
relations but for international situations also. Strategic 
partnership is such a thing that should be preserved by all 
countries. This case should not be over-dramatized. 
  [Snow] So you don't think there is any danger that the 
Americans may move back to a rather sort of Cold War stance? 
  [Stankevich] I hope that the reception, that the estimation 
of this case will be more moderate than maybe first reaction. 
  [Snow] On what's been going on in the Russian parliament 
today, a very important session because it's giving us a clue as 
to what sort of an institution you are now sitting in, this 
pardoning of the people who staged that hold-out in the White 
House last year, does this mean we're going to see Khasbulatov 
and Rutskoy back on the streets? 
  [Stankevich] I think yes, they will be freed in several days 
as far as I can understand the result of the current decision, 
and I think it was quite reasonable decision. One should take 
into account that Russian society is deeply splitted, 
politically, ideologically and so on. We adopted new 
constitution and now it's necessary to give Russian people a 
chance for national reconciliation. It is not a one sided 
decision just to give pardon to these people, Rutskoy, 
Khasbulatov and others, it is a package of decisions and the 
appeal for national reconciliation is the essence of this 
package... 
  [Snow, interrupting] ...not good news though, for the man 
you 
used to be so close to -- Boris Yeltsin? 
  [Stankevich] I think that Boris Yeltsin also in his 
tomorrow's speech, tomorrow he will address to the Russian 
parliament, also will take some measures to guarantee that 
national reconciliation can be possible. So I think that it 
will be good initiative for him and he can use this chance to 
make his part of the way [as heard]. 
  [Snow] Now you're a reformist, a moderate. What's it like 
sitting in there with Mr. Zhirinovskiy on the far right? How far 
is he able to play fast and loose with what's going on in the 
parliament? 
  [Stankevich] Mr. Zhirinovskiy is quite exotic maybe 
demonstration of some serious political affects for Russia. 
Russia should have maybe more national interest oriented 
foreign policy. It should be strengthened as a state and it is 
up to President Yeltsin, and up to Russian democrats to show 
their ability in strengthening Russian state. 
  [Snow] That does suggest you see this institution as 
something that may well be able to take in hand the nationalist 
aspirations that this exotic Mr Zhirinovskiy has conjured? 
  [Stankevich] Yes, I think that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is a very 
serious signal and Russian democrats including Russian 
president, should take this lesson seriously and should hear the 
voice of Russia. 
  [Snow] Mr. Stankevich, thank you very much indeed for 
joining 
us.

for 1.5 Million"] 
  [Text] Russia has been "driven into" a fresh scandal. Yet 
another "sweet couple" has been uncovered way across the 
Atlantic -- a high-ranking CIA man and his Colombian wife who 
provided the USSR and later Russia with information of interest 
to the KGB-Foreign Intelligence Service for regular remuneration. 
  The Clinton administration has naturally become very upset 
at 
Russia which, poor as it is, so unproductively spent $1.5 
million to buy the informers. Therefore, they in Washington are 
demanding that all persons having a hand in such an operation 
--that is, intelligence operatives -- should of their own 
accord, with no additional prompting, leave the United States. 
Otherwise, they say, we will take some measures. It is not 
ruled out that after such an affront, the Russian special 
services will announce the detention of an American informer. 
Traditions should be kept up.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "Arrest of KGB Agents in </F>
America"] 
  [Text] Washington -- U.S. President B. Clinton has 
announced the capture of the biggest foreign spy in the U.S. 
intelligence service. Aldrich Ames, a 52-year-old CIA staffer, 
had worked since 1985 first for the Soviet KGB and then for its 
Russian successors. 
  The president called this a "very serious case" and stated 
that an official protest would be made to the Russian 
Government. Russian charge d'affaires ad interim V. 
Chkhikvishvili was summoned to the State Department where 
Secretary of State W. Christopher presented him with a protest 
note. The Russian Federation Embassy has reported that the note 
contains nothing to indicate the likelihood of a complication in 
relations between the two countries. Nor does it contain a call 
for any actions by the Russian authorities. Nonetheless T. 
Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, has been instructed to 
lodge an official protest with the Russian Government. 
  A. Ames was arrested on Monday on his way to work, where he 
headed an anti-drugs subdivision. Soon his 41-year-old wife 
Maria was also arrested at home. According to information which 
is coming in she was also a paid CIA staffer -- but also a 
better paid Russian agent. 
  In a statement issued in her name Attorney General Janet 
Reno 
also called the case "extremely serious." The majority of 
experts here agree, taking into account that before he was moved 
to the drug fighting department Aldrich Ames had for a number of 
years headed the counterintelligence service resisting the 
Soviet Union. 
  R. Kessler, author of the well-known book The CIA from 
the Inside, who swiftly questioned his acquaintances in 
that organization, believes that A. Ames was informed of all the 
CIA's secret operations connected with the USSR and Russia. 
President Clinton has ordered an immediate investigation into 
the size of the damage to U.S. national security. It could be 
colossal, considering that America has few intelligence links 
left of whose reliability it can be firmly confident. 
  Over the past decades the communist states' intelligence 
services have incurred very serious losses. Despite the high 
professional reputation of the relevant services of the GDR, 
Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, the wounds inflicted by 
traitors in high positions were too deep. The actions of V. 
Penkovskiy, who worked successfully for the West for several 
years, really shook the USSR's defensive system. The collapse 
of the KGB networks in Britain, Italy, and Sweden have been 
described in sufficient detail in Western literature. The 
impression was created that since the era of Kim Philby and his 
renowned Cambridge colleagues who were the glory of the 
NKVD-MGB-KGB all that is best in Soviet intelligence is in the 
past. 
  If all the buzzing in the U.S. mass media today is true then 
in 1985 the Soviet special services made a breakthrough to 
sources of enormous value by recruiting A. Ames and his wife. 
  In contrast to Philby, Burgess, and the other aces of 
espionage, Ames and his wife found the fascination of serving 
the Soviet Union lay not in ideological unity but in the level 
of remuneration. Radio and television reports are announcing not 
without concealed delight that the USSR and Russia paid the Ames 
over $1.5 million. 
  The generous payments, many times in excess of the family's 
official income, proved fatal to it. Calculations showed that 
in the period between April 1985 and November 1993 Aldrich was 
able to take home no more than $335,164, but during this time 
the Ames' spent at least $1.3 million. They bought a house in 
Arlington, a suburb of Washington, for $540,000. They made 
ostentatious purchases with their seemingly unlimited credit 
cards: in all $455,000. They bought a Jaguar sports car for 
$25,000 -- an automobile which is not so much expensive as 
provocatively useless for a normal working family. 
  Yet the majority of CIA employees are people of very modest 
means by U.S. standards. They do not throw money about 
themselves and are very suspicious of those colleagues who are 
inclined to luxury. 
  President Clinton said he was informed long ago that the 
Ames' were under constant observation. Top secret documents 
with no direct bearing on his activity were found in Aldrich's 
official cupboard. They managed to establish his method of 
communication with his patrons from the Russian intelligence 
services. The meetings took place after a discreet sign drawn 
in chalk appeared somewhere on a mailbox in Georgetown not far 
from the Russian housing complex. 
  Incidentally, that was the subject of the couple's "spy" 
talk 
which was recorded on tape and has been broadcast on the radio 
several times. Maria was asking angrily why he was slow in 
drawing the sign and Aldrich was trying to justify himself, 
saying that there was heavy rain and the chalkmark would be 
washed away at once. 
  By studying the contents of the trash cans outside the Ames' 
house U.S. counterintelligence agents discovered last September 
old tapes from his computer printer and (or) typewriter. 
Laboratories had no difficulty in reconstituting the printed 
texts from which advance information was obtained about a 
meeting with Russian agents scheduled in Caracas, the capital of 
Venezuela. 
  He was an experienced agent and had served in Turkey and 
Mexico and was then responsible for recruiting Soviet officials 
and in particular KGB officers. He was promoted for his 
successes in this job, heading the department for fighting 
Soviet intelligence. 
  But he probably came up against a top-class Soviet 
professional, who cunningly recruited him in turn. 
  The materials handed to the court to obtain an arrest 
warrant 
for the Ames' bear out that they had passed on to the Russian 
special services information about CIA operations and personnel. 
Their activity against the United States began in 1985 although 
the CIA suspected the existence of a well concealed Soviet agent 
in its ranks at the end of the seventies. 
  If the court fines the Ames' guilty they face life 
imprisonment and a fine of $250,000. 
  President Clinton called the exposure of the Ames' a "very 
good joint operation by the FBI and the CIA." The CIA has no 
right to operate on U.S. territory although it gave the FBI full 
assistance in exposing its employee. 
  FBI Director Louis Freeh paid tribute to his CIA colleagues 
for their readiness "to help us unhesitatingly at each step" of 
the investigation, and CIA Director James Woolsey noted in an 
official statement that "this joint effort shows how our 
counterintelligence agents and FBI employees have cooperated 
over the recent period." 
  This mutual praise is an indirect response to criticism of 
past years when differences between the two intelligence 
departments allowed CIA staffer E. Howard to flee to Moscow in 
1985 and betray several U.S. agents to the KGB. 
  U.S. observers are angered most by the perfidy of Russia 
which, they say, is seeking new aid from the United States yet 
itself spending millions of dollars on anti-American espionage. 
  The picture of intelligence hostilities since the end of the 
Cold War has become motley and chaotic. The countries with 
powerful special services -- the USSR, the GDR, and 
Czechoslovakia -- no longer exist. The successors to the GDR 
and Czechoslovakia have completely halted their work against the 
West. Russia has not and is believed to have no intention of 
doing so, primarily because such activity against it has not 
ceased for a moment. 
  The commentaries of experts, who include many former 
professional intelligence workers, contain anger at the fact 
that, tempted by the Russian millions, Ames betrayed many U.S. 
agents to Moscow. Although this claim is to all appearances 
true it also attests to the hypocrisy of this anger since Russia 
has no less right to secret operations in the United States than 
America has to espionage in Russia. 
  On Tuesday U.S. journalists laid siege to the Russian 
Embassy in Washington requesting comments on the main sensation 
of the week. In the absence of a response from Moscow this was 
impossible. Accepted practice is for governments to keep quiet 
if agents working for their countries are exposed. 
  The State Department asserts that questions connected with 
Aldrich and Maria Ames may be raised with Russian Foreign 
Minister A. Kozyrev if there is confirmation of persistent 
rumors that he is coming to Washington toward the end of the 
week.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Our Man in the CIA Was Stopped From </F>
Carrying Out a Second Five-Year Mission"] 
  [Text] A few days ago CIA and FBI officers arrested the 
Ames couple on charges of spying for Russia. 
  Prior to his arrest Aldrich Hazen Ames was chief of a CIA 
group for covert operations against the USSR (later on the CIS). 
Russian special services believe that the failure of an agent 
at such a level on one hand is certainly a disappointment, but 
on the other is an indicator of the intelligence service's 
performance: After all, the agent had worked for nearly nine 
years. Especially given that according to informal statistics 
kept by many intelligence services in the world, there are five 
unexposed agents for each one that has had his cover blown. 
  The U.S. President thanked all CIA and FBI officers who took 
part in the operation and said that the United States will 
necessarily make a protest to Russia. According to the U.S. 
Justice Department, the Ames couple received payments of $1.5 
million. 
  Judging by the way they were arrested, sources in the 
Russian 
special services suppose that the agents were "burned" while 
using a communication channel (setting or picking up "dead 
drops," and so forth). They also believe that during his visit 
to Moscow, Clinton knew about the pending arrest of a couple of 
Russian agents.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report: "Diplomatic Exposure"] </F>
  [Text] Accusing anyone of spying for a power with which "a 
strategic partnership" has just been announced is a serious 
step. Clearly, the political effects of such actions tend to be 
carefully weighed, there cannot be any coincidences here. The 
first striking thing is that Yevgeniy Primakov, director of the 
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS], and Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev are out of Moscow, and we do not have an 
ambassador in Washington. 
  There is another thing, however, that matters much more. The 
exposure of a spy has coincided with Boris Yeltsin's new Bosnian 
initiative. Some two days ago he proposed that the United 
States, Britain, France, and Germany hold a summit in a European 
capital to sign a peace settlement plan for Bosnia. Holding 
such a summit at Russia's request and, moreover, signing a peace 
plan would be inconvenient for Western leaders at this stage. 
The scandal over Ames' arrest removes the Russian initiative 
from the agenda and brings its publicity effect to naught. 
  The incident with the shooting on a Swedish UN convoy 
outside 
the Muslim enclave of Vitez, after which the command of the UN 
forces in Bosnia immediately asked NATO for air protection, 
speaks in favor of this theory. A provocation? Maybe. But no 
one will bother to find out the truth. 
  Moscow itself is to blame to some extent for such a turn of 
events: Too loudly has it celebrated its diplomatic success. 
Meanwhile, the success is far from evident. Bringing Sarajevo 
under UN control means that the Muslims must be disarmed to a 
level corresponding to that of the Serbs. The Russian partners 
have so far not coped with the task. 
  The spy scandal can also mark an end to the discussion on 
tightening Russia's foreign policy doctrine. The arrest of an 
agent is an irrefutable argument for the Americans. Not to 
speak of the huge fees paid to Ames, which would knock out on 
the spot any advocate of extensive assistance to Russia. As 
soon as the FBI starts estimating the damage done to America by 
Ames, the old outcry -- "the Russians cannot be trusted" -- will 
be revived to a new intensity. 
  But what has actually happened? Intelligence services all 
over the world operate against each other, and this does not 
harm bilateral relations in any way. For instance, the exposure 
of an Israeli spy, Pollard, has not affected the 
American-Israeli partnership. 
  What appears to be a somewhat promising sign is the fact 
that 
the Russian intelligence service, although it would not comment 
on the Ames case, does not pretend it has nothing to do with 
him, as has often been the case previously. We do not know 
whether an American spy is presently serving a sentence in 
Russia. If one is, the matter could be straightened out to the 
full satisfaction of both sides by carrying out a classical 
exchange. To do so, however, we will have to wait for a trial 
to establish Ames' guilt.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Sevryukov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- In order to "put a full 
stop to resolving the Yugoslav conflict", Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin said on Wednesday [23 February] he was inviting 
President Bill Clinton and the leaders of Great Britain, France 
and Germany to a one-day meeting. He believes this international 
peace summit might result in signing a document "which would be 
of historic importance and help cease bloodshed in Yugoslavia". 
  The necessary premises have been already created. "The 
European peace plan" to settle the crisis in former Yugoslavia, 
which was discussed at yesterday's meeting of senior diplomats 
from Russia, the United States, "the European trio", NATO, and 
the United Nations in Bonn, is based to a great extent on 
Russia's concept of stabilizing the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian peace initiatives made it 
possible to stop bloodshed in Sarajevo, to avert the NATO 
threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions and to 
take a small first step towards a final peace agreement between 
the three warring factions in Bosnia. The major success of 
Russia's foreign policy revealed the ineffectiveness of the 
"tough ultimatum" stand taken by Western countries. 
  The developments of the past few days have proved there is 
no 
need to resort to ultimatums for extending "peace dynamics" from 
the Bosnian capital to other zones of military actions. The 
Russian initiative displayed other possibilities of solving such 
problems, which can presently be exploited to open the Tuzla 
airport and to relieve Dutch peacekeepers in Srebrenica. 
  The latest events in Bosnia showed that Russia should be 
actively involved in the Balkan peace process. The world 
community is gradually coming to understand this. Thus, British 
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Douglas 
Hurd admitted in today's interview with the French newspaper LE 
FIGARO that the international community's first successful step 
towards a peaceful solution in Sarajevo had been to a 
considerable degree due to Russia's positive initiative. And 
one of the lessons to be learned by Western countries from the 
latest developments is that they should always inform Russia 
about measures they are going to take for settling the conflict, 
Mr. Hurd noted.

  [Text] Moscow February 23 (TASS) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin said on Wednesday [23 February] that the Sarajevo crisis 
was a test for the Russian foreign policy and promised to boost 
"peaceful offensive" to achieve a breakthrough in the general 
Bosnian settlement. 
  "The Bosnian crisis was a test of the firmness of our course 
in the world which showed the true potential of the Russian 
foreign policy", Yeltsin said at a meeting with Moscow teenagers 
studying in military colleges. 
  "In close cooperation with the United Nations and our 
partners we shall boost the peaceful offensive. The objective 
is that the ceasefire in sarajevo becomes a breakthrough to 
peace in the whole of Bosnia", the president stressed. 
  The crisis tested "our capability to resolutely defend the 
national and state interests of the country. Russia, as a UN 
Security Council member, as an equal participant of the 
community of democratic states demonstrated its right to 
participate in adopting key decisions of the world politics... 
which concern its lawful interests and international 
obligations. Our voice was heard in the world", the president 
said. 
  "The mechanism of partnership with the West was also tested. 
Although not immediately, with faults, but it did work", the 
president said adding that Russian stance on dialogue and 
cooperation with leading powers of the world has justified 
itself. 
  "The Sarajevo crisis has also spotlit the correctness of our 
course towards all-round strengthening of the United Nations as 
the major international organisation in ensuring peace", Yeltsin 
stressed. 
  As a result a ceasefire in Sarajevo was achieved without a 
further escalation of the military conflict, according to the 
president. "The logics of peace must, finally, win over 
nationalistic emotions which brought the peoples of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to the top limit of human sufferings", 
Yeltsin said. 
  The president expressed hope that the conflciting sides 
would 
stand up to their commitments, ensure a reliable ceasefire and 
avert provocations against international peace-keepers, 
including the Russian force in Sarajevo.

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- The creation of a 
"political coalition" to solve the crisis in Bosnia is the major 
result of the Bonn meeting of representatives of Foreign 
Ministries of Russia and the West, according to Russian envoy to 
former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin who arrived from Bonn on 
Wednesday [23 February]. 
  "The meeting demonstrated a high level of coincidence in 
approaches and assessments regarding what is to be done in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina", he told reporters. 
  The political essence of the Bonn meeting will determine 
practical steps in the near future, according to Churkin who 
said that "now we have passed the crisis situation and are 
moving to intensive political contacts". 
  He stressed that it is important to avoid new crises in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Countries interested in the settlement of the armed 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina have passed through the crisis 
stage on to intensive political contacts. The main goal of 
today is to prevent another aggravation of the situation in 
Bosnia, Russian Special Presidential Representative, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told a press conference in the 
Moscow airport "Sheremetievo-2" after his arrival from Germany 
today. 
  Churkin said the main outcome of a meeting between 
representatives of the UN, EU [European Union], Russia, the US 
and Canada in Bonn is the creation of "a political coalition for 
the settlement of the conflict in Bosnia." He added that 
meetings of this kind will be continued. "The experience 
demonstrates that such a meeting can be convoked within 24 
hours," he said. 
  The diplomat put a special emphasis on the fact that the 
Bosnian crisis was attended on the highest level both in Russia 
and other countries. "This creates pre-conditions for pushing 
the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina to a peaceful settlement. 
However, the last word rests with them," he said. 
  Speaking on the transfer of the Russian battalion within the 
UN peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia to Sarajevo, the 
deputy minister said "their security cannot be guaranteed by 
100% as they serve in the most dangerous area, on the line 
separating Serb and Moslem armed formations." 
  "Security of Russian servicemen is our priority. We have 
done our best to politically guarantee their security," Churkin 
said. 
  In his opinion, there is no need for a stronger Russian 
contingent in the region so far. "However, we need to prepare 
an additional contingent. As soon as a ceasefire is established 
in Bosnia, Russia will need to reinforce its peacekeepers," he 
was quoted as saying. 
  Churkin said he was satisfied with the contacts with the 
Serb 
political leadership and military command. "Russia lays no 
claims to the Serb side which solved issues of deblockading 
Sarajevo very flexibly," the diplomat stated. 
  Churkin said Russia's relations with the NATO "may change 
only for the better." "The present crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
has been a lesson for all of us. It must be evident for the 
Western partners that Russia's positions in Europe are highly 
influential," he said. 
  In his speech, Churkin warned against euphoria. "The 
situation in Bosnia remains tense. There are many dangers. 
However, it is important not to slow down the pace and achieve 
a peaceful settlement. If no settlement follows, the present 
psychologically favorable moment may be missed," he said. 
  Asked whether Yeltsin's initiative to convoke a summit of 
five world's leading nations interested in settlement in Bosnia 
could come off, Churkin pointed out that "it is too early to 
speak of this seriously." "There are many variants of meetings 
with the participation of Russia and other states involved in 
the peaceful settlement, including those on the highest level," 
he said. However, no specific proposals have been made so far, 
Churkin added.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Speaking on security guarantees 
for the Russian peacekeeping contingent in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Vitaliy Churkin said that regrettably there was no 100 percent 
certainty on this score. According to him, the region where the 
Russian battalion was carrying out its duties is one of the most 
dangerous in Sarajevo. At the same time, the Russian diplomat 
stressed that "every necessary step is being taken to create 
political guarantees of security." 
  With regard to the possibility of increasing the Russian 
contingent of peacekeeping troops, Vitaliy Churkin said that 
"there is no immediate necessity for this to be done." However, 
in his opinion, the need for additional peacekeeping forces will 
certainly arise in the near future, when a peace agreement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is reached. 
  The Russian diplomat believes that "there are still many 
dangers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is no place for 
euphoria. It is important not to lose momentum and get down to 
political settlement. If there is no settlement, this 
psychologically opportune moment can be lost and all sorts of 
things might yet happen in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  In Vitaliy Churkin's opinion, there are no "fundamental 
differences" in Russia's or NATO's approaches to the Bosnian 
crisis. He stressed that now everybody understands that "the 
Sarajevo experience cannot fully be transplanted to other 
regions and hot spots in Bosnia and Herzegovina." At the Bonn 
meeting, in particular, there were no calls for using strong arm 
tactics. There was full understanding of the need for political 
settlement.

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- Participating in the 
Sarajevo settlement, Russia as a member of the world community 
has upgraded its own status, Marshal of the Russian Air Force 
Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov said in an interview with TASS on 
Wednesday [23 February]. He highly praised the efforts taken by 
the Russian president and diplomats for averting NATO threatened 
air strikes in Bosnia, noting that Russia "demonstrated its 
capability of moderating by peaceful means armed conflicts 
exhausting both big and small nations". 
  Shaposhnikov expressed sincere support of Russian soldiers 
serving now in the U.N. peacekeeping forces in former 
Yugoslavia, assessing their mission as a historic one. On day 
of Fatherland's defenders, the Marshal wished Russian 
servicemen, wherever they are staying at the moment -- in 
Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina or on Afghan border -- to be 
steadfast, self-controlled and to fulfil their military duty in 
the way Russians have always done, from the time of the battle 
of Kulikovo to the Great Patriotic War.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] President Yeltsin condemned attempts by 
some Western leaders to stop Russia from resolving some 
important world issues. Here is the opinion of Boris Yeltsin's 
press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, on the latest events 
around Yugoslavia. 
  [Begin Kostikov recording] I would like to recall in this 
respect that recently the opposition accused the president of 
all the deadly sins: in betraying Russia's interests and in 
selling himself to the West, and in playing to the foreign 
policy tune of the United States... How much speculation there 
were around trips to Yugoslavia. All and sundry went there, in 
an attempt to earn some political brownie points on the Yugoslav 
crisis. 
  President Yeltsin, however, managed to succeed where our 
political chatterboxes failed -- he demonstrated in deed the 
clause, enshrined in the new constitution, that it is the 
President of Russia who is the guarantor of Russia's national 
security. 
  A few more words on the president's role in these events. 
Let us word this issue in simple terms: Who, except for 
President Yeltsin, could say today such a weighty and decisive 
word -- so that it would have been heard in Sarajevo, Bonn, and 
Washington -- in the whole world, as a fact. There is no other 
person like this now. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS--Spokesman of the Russian 
president said NATO threats to deliver air strikes on Bosnia 
show that the alliance is "still imprisoned by `Cold War' 
ideology, despite all peace-making rhetorics". 
  After the Russian initiative averted air strikes on 
Sarajevo, 
"statements came from NATO and several high-ranking diplomatic 
circles which contain barely hidden disappointment that NATO had 
not used its assault airforce. The idea is being imposed that 
the NATO ultimatum should be used to 'ensure order' in other 
places of the conflict. Moreover, attempts are made to shade 
the Russian role in initiating a diplomatic solution of the 
conflict. Special bewilderment is caused by attempts to doubt 
the capability of the Russian peace-keeping force to 
professionally and impartially fulfill its duty", Vyacheslav 
Kostikov said in a statement on Wednesday [23 February]. 
  "There is an impression that NATO, despite peace-making 
rhetorics, is still imprisoned by the ideology of the Cold War. 
Psychologically one can understand that it is difficult for NATO 
to adapt to a sharp change in political realities caused by the 
birth of a democratic Russia. However, the price in human 
lives, the risk which, as it turned out, the NATO command is 
ready to take to support its status cannot but cause concern", 
the spokesman said. 
  The Russian president is sure that Russia should and will 
participate in solving all major international problems, 
according to Kostikov who added that Russia will not allow any 
discrimination regarding itself. "However, the new Russia is not 
going to participate in any ritual sacrifices", he stressed. 
  "Russia rejects the language of military ultimatums and 
welcomes the language of diplomacy. A return to the psychology 
of the Cold War, heightening mistrust, a new wave of spy mania 
would contradict the ideas of international partnership for 
peace", Kostikov said. 
  The Russian president is convinced that "the arguments of 
peace in Europe are weightier than the arguments of war and 
invites leaders of Europe and the United States to draw a line 
under the Bosnian conflict at a table of negotiations", he 
stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, </F>
commander of Russia's Airborne troops, by Vladimir Solovyev, in 
Eastern Slavonia on 23 February -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Solovyev] Today on the Day of Defenders of the 
Fatherland at the main base of the Russian battalion in the 
former Yugoslavia in Eastern Slavonia, the traditional parade 
with presentation of medals was not held. Parades have been 
postponed until better times. Out of 1,200 soldiers and 
officers, 400 have been dispatched to Sarajevo from here. 
  [Podkolzin] Today they have already been fully deployed 
there, they have been deployed normally. There is electricity. 
So far there is no heating, but it was promised that in the 
course of the next two days they would be supplied with heating. 
  The battalion has already received a combat task. Today the 
battalion is serving in the main areas: it is guarding one area 
for the collection of the Serb weapons under an accord which was 
reached between the Muslims and the Serbs -- and one group is 
today serving at Sarajevo airport. Well, and the others have 
received the task of patrolling the separation line between the 
Serbs and the Muslims. I got in touch with General Rose, and he 
said that on the whole they would be serving in very difficult 
sectors, difficult areas. We were on the brink of this disaster 
but both the Serbs and Muslims have carried out their 
obligations as a result of which the strike was called off, and 
let's pray that there won't be another one. 
  [Solovyev] Do you think that your battalion will be there 
for 
a long time? 
  [Podkolzin] Until they set about the next stage of the 
cease- 
fire -- this is the opening of the roads for the delivery of 
humanitarian aid and other issues -- no less than two months 
will elapse -- but as a whole, it would appear that the 
contingent will have to be kept there probably no less than two 
years; this is my personal opinion.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report: "Russian Military Wary of Boris </F>
Yeltsin's Plan for Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] In the near future Russia will apparently send an 
extra contingent of peacekeeping forces to Bosnia to reinforce 
the 400 paratroopers moved from Croatia to Sarajevo. This 
matter is currently being discussed by politicians and 
diplomats. Meanwhile, the Russian military are growing ever 
more wary of various sorts of political agreements and, 
according to KOMMERSANT-DAILY reports, from now on they are 
intent on assessing the actions by politicians from the point of 
view of their readiness to heed the Armed Forces' interests. 
  Against the backdrop of universal euphoria with regard to 
the 
truce in the Sarajevo area, Russian servicemen appear to be the 
only ones who are not showing any particular pleasure in that 
regard. The top brass in Moscow has always been wary of UN 
attempts to have Russia enhance its military presence in the 
former Yugoslavia. The Defense Ministry is positively certain 
that should hostilities resume, under no circumstances will any 
Russian officers order shooting on Serbs. Accusations of 
supporting "religious brothers" that will be inevitably hurled 
against the Russian servicemen following such a refusal would 
give NATO a pretext to support the Muslims in response, 
something which may cause an escalation of the Yugoslav conflict. 
  Pavel Grachev has suggested in a telephone conversation with 
his U.S. counterpart, William Perry, that the United States send 
in its troops to observe the truce from the side of the Bosnian 
Muslims. His proposal was effectively turned down 
(KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported the talks in yesterday's issue), so 
Russia will still have to reinforce its contingent in Sarajevo 
unilaterally. 
  There is yet another reason for the army's reluctance to be 
involved in peacekeeping operations. In the Defense Ministry's 
view, particular importance should be attached to conflicts 
under way near the country's borders on CIS territory. 
Currently, over 16,000 Russian servicemen are involved in 
efforts to settle them. Unlike the "blue helmets," they have 
neither peacekeeping status, nor financial support from 
international organizations.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Tretyakov report: "`Canards' Flying in From Across </F>
the Ocean. On Russian-Polish Relations"] 
  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 21 Feb--It is planned to hold a 
Russian-Polish government-level conference under the motto "On 
the Path to New Partnership" 23-25 February in Krakow. A 
Russian delegation headed by Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev 
will take part. 
  The aim of the conference is to assess the state of 
Russian-Polish political and economic relations and elaborate 
mechanisms to strengthen mutual cooperation. This meeting could 
play an important role in eliminating obstructions in the way of 
raising the effectiveness of our cooperation and finding 
compromises for the many controversial questions which have 
emerged following B. Yeltsin's visit to Poland last year. 
  However, the prospects of a warmer climate in Moscow-Warsaw 
relations is evidently not to Washington's liking; judging by 
its actions, it has not given up plans for creating a "cordon 
sanitaire" around Russia. 
  We say nothing about how this is being done at the 
diplomatic 
level, where everything is always shrouded in mystery; but at 
propaganda level such trends can be clearly outlined. 
  You do not need to go far to find examples. Literally on the 
eve of the conference the influential WPROST periodical 
published an article by a staffer of the U.S. Hoover Institute 
in which the author, clearly distorting historical facts and 
making vague hints, dumbfounds readers with the claim that 
during World War II Krakow was saved from destruction by the 
Hitlerite invaders not through the heroism of liberating Soviet 
servicemen but as a result Vatican pressure on Berlin. [passage 
omitted] 
  What is this -- the latest attempt to falsify history, and, 
what is more, so obviously? Evidently not! This is big-league 
stuff. It even includes elements of psychological warfare, aimed 
at setting Slavs at loggerheads with each other by playing on 
religious feelings, and even using blatant lies in the process. 
They are also counting on the fact that there are few 
eye-witnesses of these events left, and indeed that anti-Russian 
sentiments, stirred up by certain political circles on the 
Vistula, have been reinforced in Poland in the past four years. 
  To follow these "sensational historical facts" the U.S. 
special services are putting new, "fresh" ones, into 
circulation. A few days ago THE WASHINGTON POST published an 
article which, citing a former high-ranking CIA staffer, claims 
that during the 1980's, without the USSR's knowledge, the Poles 
sold large consignments of state-of-the-art secret Soviet 
weapons to the Americans to the tune of over $200 million. Some 
types, notably the "Strela" missile launchers, were then sold by 
the Americans to the Afghan mojahedin, who used them to shoot 
down Soviet military aircraft. 
  Such insinuations by THE WASHINGTON POST have clearly placed 
the Polish Ministry of National Defense in an impasse. Its 
spokesmen were clearly shocked. Polish National Defense 
Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk called the article an act of 
provocation. 
  Whereas in the first case the Americans were making snide 
remarks about Poland, in the second this was obviously aimed at 
Russia, counting on the fact that Moscow was bound to be annoyed 
at the "perfidy" of its former Warsaw Pact ally. 
  It cannot be ruled out the Washington is currently going 
through a period when its head is being turned with success 
following the collapse of the USSR and the significant weakening 
of Russia, which is busy with its own serious domestic problems. 
It is trying to dictate its terms of play to the world even by 
rewriting history and spreading obvious disinformation. 
  The question is solely one of whether our two neighboring 
countries should be led by Washington and shut themselves off 
from each other by a wall of hostility. Or whether they should 
nevertheless be guided by pragmatism and reestablish relations 
on the principles of partnership and mutually advantageous 
cooperation. It looks as though the Russian-Polish conference 
in Krakow will provide some answers to these difficult questions.

Shmelyov] 
  [Text] Krakow February 23 (TASS) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev outlined a new concept of all-European 
partnership, addressing a conference of Russian and Polish 
economists and political experts "on the way to new partnership" 
held in an ancient cathedral in Krakow. 
  The most important out of the seven elements of partnership 
suggested by Kozyrev is the development of European-Atlantic 
interaction. This interaction should be based on the 
transformation of CSCE into an efficient regional political 
organisation, and the Council of North Atlantic Cooperation - 
into an independent structure of military and political 
cooperation closely connected with the CSCE. 
  The aim of this is to coordinate efforts made by NATO, EC, 
the Council of Europe, the European Union and the CIS in the 
field of strengthening stability and security, peace-keeping 
activities and defence of rights of ethnic minorities in Europe. 
  Kozyrev suggested creating a network of complementary 
bilateral agreements on partnership, cooperation and 
consultations not only between NATO and countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe. "We do not rule out that Russia might become 
part of NATO some day, but the idea of partnership is the key 
problem today," he said. 
  "The dignity and far-sightedness of the "Partnership for 
Peace" programme adopted by NATO leaders is that it works as if 
opening NATO, taking a first step on the way from changing it 
from a bloc into another form of ensuring security, thus fully 
meeting our concept of the European partnership. In 
perspective, we expect the opening of the communications channel 
"The CIS - NATO," Kozyrev said. 
  "We want to put into practice a principle of indivisibility 
of security on the entire European continent," said Polish 
Foreign Minister Andrzei Olechowski, addressing the conference. 
He said that the way to such Europe without demarcation lines 
lies through the expansion of existing Western European 
structures. 
  In Olechowski's opinion, "partnership for the sake of 
transformations" is necessary in relations between Poland and 
Russia. He called on the West to render no less assistance to 
Russia than to Poland. Russia should have a permanent seat in 
the G-7, the European Community should give Russian goods an 
access to the European market, and financial institutions and 
developed Western countries should effectively support the 
stabilisation and convertibility of the Russian rouble, the 
Polish minister said. 
  "The whole world is aware of it, agrees with it, but is not 
in a hurry to offer aid," Olechowski said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb 23 (TANJUG) -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev on Wednesday [23 February] sharply criticized 
NATO members for trying to solve the Bosnian conflict on their 
own, and called for joint actions to achieve peace in Bosnia. 
  Russia was ready to send more troops to Bosnia, if it was 
necessary, Kozyrev said in an interview to the Polish television 
in Krakow, where he took part in the [word indistinct] Russian 
confermce on the new partnership. 
  It was a big delusion to think that NATO was able to solve 
every problem unilaterally. He criticized NATO members for 
deciding about the Sarajevo action without prior consultation 
with the east. 
  NATO was last week ready to launch air strikes in the 
Sarajevo area acting on the ultimatum to the warring sides to 
demilitarize that city. In reality, the threats were addressed 
to the Bosnian Serbs alone. 
  The Bosnian Serbs started withdrawing heavy weapons around 
Sarajevo on Friday, only after the Moscow initiative and 
guarantees, and Russian peacekeepers were deployed on the line 
dividing the Serb and Moslem side.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by Boris </F>
Kalyagin in Moscow on 23 February; from the "On the Way to New 
Partnership" program--live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Kalyagin] Andrey Vladimirovich, your meetings with 
the Czech, Polish, and Hungarian leaders coincided with the 
Russian initiative in Bosnia. As one knows, the countries of 
the Visegrad group reacted differently to the NATO ultimatum, 
and how did they perceive our initiative? How close are our and 
their approach to the settlement in Bosnia? 
  [Kozyrev] I think everyone perceived our initiative 
unanimously positively. This was said in public and, in 
particular, we were discussing it in detail during our meetings. 
Why? Because, as Hungarian President Arpad Goncz said publicly 
-- and he is one of the authoritative leaders in Central Europe 
-- first of all, we have saved Yugoslavia -- Serbia -- from an 
escalation of the conflict which nobody wants, on the contrary, 
there is too much violence there and it should be extinguished. 
  Second, according to him, we have saved NATO from the 
necessity of taking the measures which are unpredictable by 
their consequences. Imagine, if the air strikes had taken 
place, what would have followed? Indeed, the situation is 
unpredictable. 
  Of course, our initiative was welcome. We are interested in 
using the momentum of the positive movement created by President 
Yeltsin's initiative not for gaining points for ourselves, but 
for uniting everyone's efforts in order to resolve the tragic 
situation in Bosnia. 
  [Kalyagin] I would like to return to the issue of our 
relations with the Central European countries which you have 
visited. You said that we have wonderful relations with all 
members of the Visegrad group. But one problem still exists -- 
joining NATO. They agreed to take part in the Partnership for 
Peace program, but they underline that they consider it to be 
the first step on the way to joining NATO. What is our position? 
  [Kozyrev] I would like to tell you that the attitude is 
already changing. We all would be bad politicians and bad 
diplomats if we thought that somebody said something and then we 
were right whatever was happening. The logic of life says that 
the diplomacy should be flexible, and we do take into 
consideration what our Central European partners are saying. 
This was the meaning of my visit -- not only to say what we 
think but also to listen to them because we should understand 
what people in Central Europe think. Life there is not the same 
either. For example, there was a news conference this morning. 
This was my joint news conference with Andrzej Olechowski, the 
foreign minister of Poland. This is the country which, let us 
say, tried most actively to join NATO. He even said that at the 
moment it is very important to have partners and then we shall 
see what to do, maybe we all join NATO -- by the way, maybe even 
Russia, we do not rule out that at some stage or after some 
stage we will also join NATO. He even said that it is possible 
that NATO will dissolve or transform into some wider system of 
security. You can see that some variations have already 
appeared. 
  [Kalyagin] You took part in a conference which focused on a 
search for ways towards a new partnership. What recipes for 
achieving a real partnership does the Polish side offer? 
  [Kozyrev] It was not to their desire to join NATO that 
Olechowski devoted most of his speech at the conference today. 
This was not the leitmotif of his speech. The leitmotif was: 
we must cooperate both in the West and in the East. You see 
what sort of an idea this is. Former COMECON links have been 
severed but we must restore them on a new foundation, on the 
basis of mutual advantage, market relations and so on. Does 
this not show that things are being seen differently now? This 
means that we have been understood, we have been heard. After 
all, NATO -- you may cooperate with it as much as you like -- 
but NATO is a military-political bloc, and where does this leave 
economy? Where does economy stand in this process, or the human 
rights, or democracy, or cultural links -- is there no need for 
these things? And now, you will have noticed that 80 percent of 
the Polish minister's speech was about economic ties, the ties 
in the East, with Russia. 
  [Kalyagin] You paid very great attention to economic 
interaction, especially in Hungary. What specific results were 
achieved? 
  [Kozyrev] I think that we need to prepare the specific 
results. We are drawing up agreements to avoid dual taxation and 
to protect investments. Just pay attention here to the words. 
It is not as it used to be -- an agreement that we would supply 
them with a certain amount of goods and they would supply us 
with a certain amount of goods. That was under the planned 
economy. Now it is a question of protection against dual 
taxation, that is to say, of the involvement of commercial 
interests on both sides. That is to say, we are not imposing 
anything on anyone, but the government must create the 
conditions for economic revival. 
  [Kalyagin] Summing up the results of your whole trip, what 
would you regard as its chief outcome? 
  [Kozyrev] I think the chief outcome is that I have managed 
to 
fulfill the task set by the president. That task lay in the 
fact that, after there had been a certain collision or clash of 
views over the question of immediate NATO membership, some 
people in Central European countries were of course insisting 
that it was essential to become NATO members immediately. We 
said: let us not be precipitate, let us think it over for a 
while. The task was to achieve a normal dialogue precisely on 
those issues about which you have been speaking: how to organize 
our security and how to cooperate economically. You see, it was 
about removing tension and arriving at a normal agenda. I think 
that we managed at least to a considerable extent to fulfill 
this task set by the president.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Gornostayev report from Athens, Prague, and </F>
Budapest, under the "Diplomacy" rubric: "Russia Hopes To Sign 
Agreement With the EU. Its Drafting Now Hampered by the 
Russia-West Problem of Nuclear Commodities Export"] 
  [Text] An important part of Andrey Kozyrev's talks with 
his counterparts from three European countries -- the former, 
present, and future EC chairmen from Belgium, Greece, and 
Germany -- is the drafting of an Agreement on Partnership and 
Cooperation with the European Union [EU] based on the eponymous 
declaration signed by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin 
with EU leaders in Brussels last December. At present, stressed 
Galina Sidorova, political adviser to the Russian foreign 
minister, it is necessary to specify the principles incorporated 
in the declaration. 
  There are a number of obstacles along this road, however. 
One moot point in the drafting of an agreement is the export of 
nuclear materials; another is the problem of Russian legislation 
in the banking sphere. According to G. Sidorova, Russia is 
assuring its Western partners that the second moot point could 
be resolved in the nearest future. 
  The problem of selling nuclear materials appears more 
difficult. There are a number of states fearing Russian import 
in this sphere. They want to assign to Moscow rather low quotas 
although this item of export is one of the most profitable for 
it. Russia is naturally unhappy with this, and is arguing for 
the removal of any restrictions in this area of trade, 
proceeding from the fact that other countries trading in nuclear 
materials are not restricted by quotas either under GATT or 
other international trade agreements. The West still continues 
to fear competing with Russia on the nuclear products market. 
Moscow, however, is hoping to sign an agreement with the EU in 
this sphere in the coming six months, even before the 
termination of the chairmanship of Greece, which has assured 
Russia that it would facilitate this in every way, something 
that was stated by Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou when 
he received Kozyrev in Athens. 
  During the talks in Athens, the Russian minister and his 
Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias discussed, in addition to 
international questions, those of bilateral cooperation. 
Kozyrev invited Papoulias to visit Moscow this coming April. 
It is perhaps then that a number of Russo-Greek documents 
regulating, among other things, consular relationships will be 
signed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Britain, which ruled nearly half the world in the 
past, is one of the countries that selects its own allies 
regardless of which country is eager to cooperate with it in the 
political, strategic, and economic fields. It seems that 
Britain focuses more attention on its long-term interests than 
on its long-term allies. So it is no coincidence that mutual 
interests have brought Britain and Azerbaijan closer. 
Considering requirements earlier this century, British 
officials have turned to Azerbaijan again, never mind that 70 
years have passed since the last time. Several officials have 
linked that with Britain's bid for Baku's oil. But Britain, 
which has established links with the Caucasus as one of the most 
developed countries, maintains more serious objectives, which 
will serve stability in the region. 
  Of course, all that will be widely discussed in the 
high-level talks between Britain and Azerbaijan in London. 
Undoubtedly, President Geydar Aliyev and Prime Minister John 
Major will deliberate on the dispute between Azerbaijan and 
Armenia and try to establish a way to remove the dispute. 
Britain's position on it is common knowledge. After Turkey, it 
was the second country to establish its final approach to the 
Karabakh dispute. And it did that long ago. Perhaps that is 
why President Ter-Petrosyan left Britain with empty hands at the 
end of his visit there 10 days ago. He visited Britain with a 
great deal of hope. 
  But malicious circles in Azerbaijan have described President 
Aliyev's visit as an effort to seek Western support. They have 
made unreasonable and wrong statements in that regard. There is 
nothing in Azerbaijan's cooperation with Britain to harm the 
interests of third countries. Naturally, Azerbaijan also wishes 
to cooperate with France, Germany, Russia, and several other 
countries. Everyone knows that those countries have adopted a 
[word indistinct] approach to Azerbaijan's sincere wish to 
cooperate with them. 
  The bilateral agreements that will be signed during 
President 
Aliyev's visit to London will further consolidate the legal and 
political basis of bilateral relations. Consequently, our 
relations will become more productive. The cooperation with 
Britain, which is a leading country in modern technology in 
industry and agriculture, will create an opportunity for 
Azerbaijan to reorganize its industry somewhat. 
  And President Aliyev's visit may lead to surprising and 
favorable developments. Naturally, all that will create a new 
opportunity for Azerbaijan to improve its cooperation with 
Western countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Representative in Azerbaijan Mahmud </F>
al-Sa'id by an unidentified TURAN correspondent in Baku on 22 
February] 
  [Text] Baku (February 22) TURAN--Question: May the NATO's 
"Partnership For Peace" be related to Azerbaijan from a judicial 
point of view? 
  Answer: I can't say anything about the programme itself for 
I am not NATO's but the UN representative in Azerbaijan. The UN 
is in close contact and cooperation with all regional 
organizations. Lately, the UN's cooperation with the NATO have 
become closer in an attempt to settle the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia. The willingness of sovereign Azerbaijan to 
participate in the Partnership For Peace is the matter to be 
settled between Azerbaijan and NATO. I'd like to add that the 
UN supports any decision which does not contradict its Charter 
and contributes to the strengthening of peace and security. 
  Question: The latest developments in Sarajevo enhance the 
possibility of bringing the NATO's peace mission to Europe. May 
such mission's coming to Azerbaijan be materialized? 
  Answer: I don't have a crystal ball. It is the CSCE which 
deals with such issues in Azerbaijan. When in New York, I met 
with the new Chairman of the Minsk Group Jan Eliasson. Now, he 
returned the Swedish Foreign Ministry. He is a very experienced 
diplomat. He has a good experience of negotiating and 
mediating. Before the last appointment, Jan Eliasson had been 
Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs. The new 
Chairman is expected to visit the conflict zone shortly. 
  Question: The mandate of the UNOMIG [United Nations 
Organization Mission in Georgia] was extended until March 7, 
1994. The UNSC Resolution 896 calls for an immediate 
determination of the political status of Abkhazia within the 
parameters of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Georgia. What do you think the political status is. If similar 
developments take place in Nagorno-Karabakh, how would you like 
to see the status of Nagorno-Karabakh? 
  Answer: I attended that very meeting of the Security 
Council. Following the report of the SG, Special Representative 
for Georgia, it was decided to increase the number of observers. 
All UN resolutions on Georgia reiterate the territorial 
integrity of Georgia. The resolution requested Georgia to 
accelerate the search for political ways of settlement of the 
conflict in Abkhazia. If the problem of Abkhazia exists then 
political ways should be found to settle it. The same idea 
could be applied to Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. If there had 
been no conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Security Council would 
have never discussed this problem. All resolutions including 
822 and the rest 3 on NK [Nagorno-Karabakh] clearly say that no 
conflict can be settled by military means but by political means 
within certain parameters. 
  As for political status, the conflict involving Abkhazia is 
one thing but Nagorno-Karabakh is something different. I have 
always said that it is very risky to compare different conflicts 
and that each conflict has its own reasons and peculiarities. 
But the principles are the same. The UN stands for the 
territorial integrity and sovereignty of both Georgia and 
Azerbaijan and seeks to promote the peaceful settlement of those 
conflicts. As far as the status is concerned, it is part of the 
negotiation process. I'd like to add that all agreements the 
parties arrive at should comply with the basic UN principles.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 23, BNS -- The CSCE High Commissioner 
for Ethnic Minorities Max van der Stoel, who leads a CSCE 
delegation visit to Estonia, said his mission had discovered no 
facts of violation against the rights of Russian-speakers in the 
country. 
  One of the key topics discussed at a meeting of the CSCE 
High 
Commissioner with Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar today was 
the issuing of residence permits to non-citizens in Estonia, 
including to the retired Russian military. 
  We had a good contact and the CSCE officials expressed their 
understanding of the issue, Laar said in a press conference. 
  The day before, on Tuesday [22 February], the CSCE High 
Commissioner had talks with municipal leaders, local school and 
municipal education board heads in the northeastern town of 
Narva. Max van der Stoel also met with the permanent CSCE 
mission in the Russian-populated town, Russia's consul general 
there, and the heads of the Narva League of Russian Citizens and 
of the former City Council. 
  Explaining the reasons why he had met the head of the League 
of Russian Citizens, Yuri Mishin, and the former City Council 
chairman Vladimir Chuikin, the CSCE high official said the 
meetings had been aimed at getting information from all sectors 
involved. 
  "This is my task," he said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 23, BNS -- The CSCE High Commissioner 
for Ethnic Minorities, Max van der Stoel, for a long time 
already has been directly interfering with the internal affairs 
of Estonia, said Tiit Made, member of the Estonian parliament's 
Foreign Affairs Commission. 
  "Last year, when the local elections law and the law on 
foreigners were discussed in Estonia, Stoel visited Narva as a 
political tourist and met there mainly with the leader of the 
League of Russian Citizens, Yuri Mishin, and former City Council 
chairman Vladimir Chuikin. Stoel then conveyed their opinions 
on to the West," the MP [member of parliament] said in an 
interview with BNS. 
  Made said it was inadmissible that the CSCE ethnic 
minorities 
high commissioner again met with Mishin and Chuikin during his 
Tuesday's [22 February] trip to Narva. 
  "Now when Chuikin is a departmental head at Narva Furniture 
Factory there is no need for Stoel to meet with him officially 
and discuss Russian affairs. Stoel can do this in his private 
capacity if he so wishes," Made said. 
  Van der Stoel himself said his meetings with Mishin and 
Chuikin were "aimed at getting information from all 
representatives of the Russian-speaking population." "This is my 
task," he said in a press conference. 
  Made in his comments said Van der Stoel had been "simply 
unable to say anything else in justification." 
  Made says the Estonian Government must give up "bending to 
Max van der Stoel and responding to his wishes." He said the 
government should "restrict interference by the High 
Commissioner into the internal life of Estonia and his 
representing the interests of Russian residents in the CSCE."

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 23, BNS -- Estonian security police 
and armed forces in a joint operation on Feb. 21 discovered more 
than 500 TT pistols near Luhamaa at the country's southeastern 
border with Russia. 
  The guns were seized and handed over to the defense forces, 
said Juri Pihl, director general of the Defense Police. Pihl 
said nobody was arrested so far, but his department has 
initiated a criminal case on arms smuggling and misprision 
charges. 
  The criminal code foresees a jail sentence of 3 to 8 years 
for such crimes. 
  Russian customs in their checkpoint of Petseri, opposite 
Luhamaa, on Feb. 21 uncovered five guns and lots of cartridges 
in a car headed from Estonia to Russia. Those who were in the 
car have been arrested.

  [Text] Lech Walesa, president of the Republic of Poland, 
met Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs today. After the 
talks the Latvian prime minister told reporters about what was 
discussed during the meeting with the Polish president. 
  [Begin Birkavs recording] The Polish president's visit is a 
new stage in Latvian-Polish relations. There is a mutual desire 
to make our relations considerably more active in two main 
spheres -- security and economy. In the security sphere, a 
deeper military cooperation is meant. We have agreements which 
have already been concluded between the ministries of defense. 
Deeper military cooperation means cooperation within the 
framework of the Union of Baltic Sea Countries, cooperation 
between the Baltic region and the (Wyszogrod) region, and, of 
course, the development of bilateral relations between Latvia 
and Poland in the security context. 
  We also discussed the problem of the Kaliningrad region 
where 
there an is extremely large concentration of armed forces, and 
about which the world knows practically very little at the 
moment. 
  In the sphere of the economy we discussed our opportunities. 
So then, we are waiting for a Polish trade visit, an 
exhibition. We are waiting for the Polish prime minister's 
visit to Latvia. We discussed development of a transport 
corridor which is extremely necessary, including reciprocal 
ferry transport between Liepaja and Szczecin or Liepaja and 
other ports, Polish ports. 
  Very good foundations have been created for Latvian-Polish 
relations, both legal foundations and also personal foundations 
in relations between the heads of the states. 
  Mr. Walesa said: If I were once again to make a revolution, 
I would not make a mistake which I made in Poland. I would 
begin privatization much sooner, I would carry out it much more 
vigorously, and I would begin with large rather than small 
enterprises. 
  I think Mr. Walesa answered precisely the question of 
whether 
the Latvian government is acting correctly when it is beginning 
a vigorous privatization process, or not. I think that this is 
Polish support for the Latvian Government. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by political scientist Borys Vasylenko: "How To </F>
Fill In a `Security Vacuum,' or a Step That Brings Ukraine 
Closer to Integration Into Europe"] 
  [Text] The end of the "Cold War," the end of the 
Warsaw Pact, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union led to 
the collapse of the bipolar system, which had determined the 
course of world events since World War II. NATO found itself in 
a complex situation. The adversary for whose deterrence the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization had been created disappeared. 
NATO became confronted with the task of finding a new objective 
for its existence and new functions. 
  The dramatic development of events in former Yugoslavia 
highlighted the "security vacuum" problem, which had taken shape 
in the Central and Eastern Europe zone. The former Warsaw Pact 
states and the newly created Eastern European states had to deal 
with the task of guaranteeing security in fundamentally new 
conditions. Some of them -- the countries of the Visegrad Group 
and the Baltic states -- see a way out for themselves in joining 
NATO and the European Community [EC] as soon as possible. One 
of their major considerations has been the hope to achieve a 
rapid economic integration into the European structure and to 
enjoy the ensuing advantages. 
  In 1993, attempts by those countries to join NATO quickly 
met 
with increasing opposition on the part of Russia. The prospect 
of finding the North Atlantic Alliance close to the country's 
borders was categorically objected to. Since the early autumn 
of 1993, Moscow's position with regard to the prospects of 
Central and Eastern European countries joining NATO became more 
inflexible. 
  It was precisely under those circumstances that the United 
States, which plays the most influential role in determining the 
future of NATO, came out with the "Partnership for Peace" 
initiative. As a matter of fact, the "Partnership" program is a 
compromise between the desire on the part of Central and Eastern 
European countries to join the Alliance and its members' 
attempts to avoid a deterioration in relations with Russia, 
something, which, in their opinion, would be detrimental to the 
position of reformers in Moscow. 
  On 10 and 11 January, a summit held by the NATO members in 
Brussels adopted a framework document "Partnership for Peace." 
In accordance with the decisions adopted at the summit, all 
European countries, including nonaligned ones, were invited to 
participate in the "Partnership for Peace" program. 
  On 8 February 1994, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Anatoliy Zlenko put his signature to the "Partnership for Peace" 
program. It must be pointed out that Ukraine was the first CIS 
country to join the "Partnership." In his speech after the 
signing, the head of the Ukrainian external political department 
stated this: "By joining the 'Partnership for Peace' program, 
Ukraine has confirmed its fundamental political priorities and 
its choice in favor of returning to Europe, from which we had 
been artificially alienated, and joining the family of European 
nations." 
  What possibilities will open up to Ukraine after it joins 
the 
"Partnership?" 
  The participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program 
will 
make it possible to achieve greater openness, will raise the 
degree of confidence in military-political relations, and will 
promote changes for the better in relations between the NATO 
leadership and Ukraine. 
  Participation in the "Partnership" will enable Ukraine to 
become active in various spheres of NATO activity and will 
facilitate the tasks of restructuring and modernizing the Armed 
Forces and raising them to the standards of NATO. 
  The program envisages cooperation in training troops and in 
preparing them for carrying out operations within the frameworks 
of the United Nations and the CSCE for the purpose of 
maintaining peace, participating in search operations, 
humanitarian tasks, and so on. 
  One of the principles of the "Partnership for Peace" is the 
treatment of every member country on an individual basis. The 
working plan, which Ukraine must devise, will conform to its 
national interests and the possibilities of financing the 
necessary transformations in the Armed Forces, exercises, 
training, and joint maneuvers. 
  The "Partnership" provides for a possibility of NATO 
consulting active participants in the program in case of a 
direct threat to their territorial integrity, political 
independence, or security. There is no doubt that the 
possibility of such consultations will contribute to 
strengthening Ukraine's security. 
  The expansion and strengthening of cooperation in the sphere 
of security is an indispensable precondition for Ukraine's 
gradual integration into European structures. When Ukraine 
achieves the status of an associate member of the EC, this will 
become yet another stage on this road. Of course, this will 
only become possible in the case of a successful implementation 
of market reforms and the country's steady development toward 
democracy. 
  The European security system is an ideal that Ukraine 
strives 
to achieve. 
  As Zlenko emphasized in his speech following the signing of 
the "Partnership for Peace," Ukraine looks upon this program as 
a "two- way road." Adapting itself to NATO standards, Ukraine 
expects that, in the final analysis, "NATO must irreversibly 
change its essence in the process of cooperation with its 
partners." In the opinion of Ukraine's minister of foreign 
affairs, precisely this will enable NATO "to play a major role 
in the new architecture of European security and form its 
foundation." It is precisely in such a security system that 
Ukraine strives to find its place.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kazimieras Klimasauskas, Lithuanian industry </F>
and trade minister, by Gediminas Koncius in Vilnius; date not 
given: "Quality Goods: Will We Have Them in Lithuania?"] 
  [Excerpts] [Koncius] Mister Minister, the TIESA editorial 
board has proposed the following regular rubric to its readers: 
"May the Words `Made in Lithuania!' Sound Proudly." We intend 
to write ourselves, and we are also inviting the readers, 
specialists, producers, and dealers to share their views on the 
production and sale of Lithuanian consumer goods. 
  In the opinion of the editorial board, the problems in this 
sphere are numerous. Why did some enterprises fail to 
restructure their production to meet market demands? Why do 
many Lithuanian quality goods not have demand on the domestic 
market? Why are imported goods so much in demand on our market, 
the majority of which are neither better nor cheaper than ours? 
We will try to stir producers' responsibility and customers' 
respect for trademarks with the inscription "Made in Lithuania." 
  [Klimasauskas] This is a good idea. I have been thinking for 
a long time that we must be a nation of nihilists. We are 
unable to rejoice at our successes, a few of which we have 
achieved. As true provincials, we loathe everything that is 
homemade. We boast only of the past, as aged people.... Many 
politicians do not even want to see the sun over their heads, to 
say nothing of the obvious economic stabilization. Nor do 
consumers value homemade goods on the commodity market due to 
the same nihilistic attitude. Without optimism and 
self-respect, however, we will not achieve anything or be 
interesting to others. 
  We really have something to boast about. Many light industry 
enterprises work stably and sell their production without 
difficulty. Those who have worn Lithuanian knitted clothes, 
eaten products from the dairy plant in Birzai, sat on furniture 
with upholstery manufactured in "Audejas" [weaver], worn suits 
made by "Lelija" [lily], drunk coffee from "Jesia's" china cups, 
will not find fault with them. "Snaige" [snowflake] 
refrigerators and freezers are in demand both on the domestic 
and foreign markets. The output of refrigerators, portable 
television sets, and bicycles climbed by 166, 110, and 107 
percent, respectively, over the last year. Our estimations are 
based not on the financial results that can be manipulated but 
on output units. Thus, they can be trusted. 
  The situation in the food processing industry is more 
difficult. The production of many food stuffs is declining, and 
they are replaced by an increasing number of imported goods. 
Lithuania is losing both the foreign market it has had and its 
own market. We used to boast about "feeding Russia," but we 
have become food importers. 
  The first reason is the improper beginning of the agrarian 
reform which was a terrible blow to food producers. The second 
reason is the outdated food processing industry. [passage 
omitted] 
  Producers have already realized that they must work not for 
"his majesty the plan" but for consumers. They must only find 
ways for pleasing the latter. 
  [Koncius] The production of quality goods requires 
investments. Where could we get money for up-to-date 
technologies and more productive equipment? 
  [Klimasauskas] Lithuania has chosen such a model of 
privatization which has actually produced no investments. 
Investment coupons for which the new owners acquired capital 
goods is not money. One cannot buy new equipment for them, 
while only traders can get bank loans with a 100-percent annual 
interest rate because turnover is faster in trade. Practically 
no one is investing in industry because this brings no profit 
today. Even a layman can notice this: New and lovely stores 
open every day, but no one has heard about the construction of 
new industrial enterprises. The exception is joint ventures 
with foreign partners who bring their own capital earned at a 
normal interest rate. 
  Incidentally, our people also have capital. I do not believe 
those businessmen who claim that there are several billion 
dollars in Lithuania. I believe, however, that the internal 
unused reserves may reach $500 million in various foreign 
currencies. 
  However, until we have a well-arranged banking system, 
admit foreign banks, and peg the litas to some stable foreign 
currency, we will have neither normal credits nor investments in 
industry. The longer this will last, the worse and more 
expensive our goods will be. 
  [Koncius] In your opinion, what should the exchange rate be 
when tying the litas to the U.S. dollar? 
  [Klimasauskas] I think that neither the sheep would be hurt 
nor the wolf would feel hungry if the dollar cost no less than 
four litai. Such an exchange rate would satisfy exporters and 
do no damage to customers in Lithuania. I believe that 
international financial organizations would also approve this 
exchange rate. 
  [Koncius] The production of quality goods requires not only 
money but also ideas. Does Lithuania have a sufficient amount 
of new ideas? [passage omitted] 
  [Klimasauskas] I have already mentioned ingenious producers. 
Unfortunately, we also have many such manufacturers who failed 
to offer anything to the market. 
  Let us take the Vilnius enterprise "Sigma," for example. I 
suppose that bright heads would have really found possibilities 
for producing personal computers there. Sadly, the slot 
machines made at this enterprise are in low demand. [passage 
omitted] 
  I understand perfectly well that bright heads are needed not 
only in production but also in the government, because a market 
economy is not chaotic, and it must be managed reasonably. The 
government has done and will do its best in supporting producers 
of consumer goods. However, it will promote only those who will 
prove that they have their own brains. 
  [Koncius] The problems in trade are no less numerous. 
  [Klimasauskas] First of all, the Seimas must speed up the 
adoption of the draft laws on trade and the protection of 
consumers' rights. Until we have them, the bazaar trade will 
flourish, and there will be no real competition. The absence of 
these laws also impairs the effective work of trade inspection 
institutions. 
  Only the law will allow us to combat piratical importers 
from 
other countries who come to us with expired goods and dishonest 
competition, and without proper service and guarantees. 
  [Koncius] Could you personally already pronounce the words 
"Made in Lithuania" with pride? 
  [Klimasauskas] First of all, I would like journalists to 
learn to pronounce these words, because the prestige of our 
goods largely depends on the press, radio, and television. 
[passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Vladimir Ardayev report: "Nursultan Nazarbayev: `It Takes </F>
Two To Tango'"] 
  [Text] Almaty -- After returning from the United States 
and France, the president of Kazakhstan communicated not only 
the results of these two visits but also his views on relations 
with Russia at a news conference Monday. 
  N. Nazarbayev's talks with B. Clinton -- at first one on 
one, 
then with the delegations -- lasted a total of three hours. In 
the estimation of the president of Kazakhstan, considering that 
this was his first meeting with the head of the present White 
House administration, the hopes that were being pinned on it 
fully justified themselves. The central place was occupied by a 
discussion of the problems of bilateral relations between 
Kazakhstan and the United States, of the situation in the CIS 
countries and in the Central Asian region, of politics in the 
world's "hot spots," and of questions of security. 
  The chief document signed as a result was the "Charter of 
Democratic Partnership Between the Republic of Kazakhstan and 
the United States of America," embracing questions of politics, 
economics, defense, science, technology, ecology, and others. 
According to Nazarbayev, it contains guarantees of security 
accorded to Kazakhstan by the United States and also stipulates 
the conditions of multilateral cooperation within the NATO 
"Partnership for Peace" program -- which in itself, he 
elaborated, certainly does not constitute Kazakhstan's joining 
the North Atlantic bloc. 
  Nazarbayev also reported that the U.S. President announced a 
significant increase in the size of financial aid for Kazakhstan 
-- to $311 million. 
  The stopover made in Paris at the request of French 
President 
Francois Mitterrand developed into a discussion of the progress 
in implementing the French-Kazakhstani accords reached earlier. 
One of the new accords consists in the fact that a renowned top 
Parisian school of management will welcome a large group of 
students from Kazakhstan. 
  "There have always been and will be Russian interests in 
Kazakhstan, just as there are Kazakhstani interests in Russia," 
Nursultan Nazarbayev said in reply to a question from REUTERS 
about consideration for these interests in the process of 
developing contacts with the United States. "Therefore we do 
not draw up a single large or small-scale international program 
without inviting the Russian side to participate in it." 
  The journalists participating in the news conference showed 
a 
lively interest in the facts cited in IZVESTIYA correspondents' 
reports (IZVESTIYA Nos. 29 and 32) concerning the Kazakhstani 
president's position during his U.S. visit -- a position 
"emphatically independent of Moscow's policy." Nazarbayev 
deemed it necessary to make his elucidations on this score after 
asking your correspondent to reproduce in the newspaper 
everything he said with the utmost accuracy. 
  The state of affairs in Russia is of interest to everyone, 
Nazarbayev said. Cadre reshuffles in the Russian Government are 
also of concern to the U.S. Administration -- what changes of 
political course might they lead to? I have always replied to 
these questions as follows: It is necessary to gamble not on 
names but on the process of democratization and economic reforms 
taking place in Russia. I do not consider V. Chernomyrdin's 
present government to be conservative -- first, because I know 
Chernomyrdin himself well; second, both Chubays and Shokhin 
remain in the government, while Gaydar and others can continue 
to exert effective influence and give assistance by working in 
parliament. Nobody will succeed in reversing the processes that 
have already been accomplished in Russia. It is essential to 
assist them, these processes -- I always emphasized this in 
America, Nazarbayev said. 
  With regard to the allegation that "Kazakhstan sold 
Baykonur without taking Russia's interests into account," 
Nazarbayev reported that only a treaty on the protection of 
"know-how," providing for the nonproliferation to third 
countries of space technologies provided by the United States, 
was signed during his U.S. visit. It was signed by the leaders 
of three aerospace departments -- U.S., Kazakhstani, and Russian 
-- and Mr. Koptev, the head of the latter, accompanied 
Nazarbayev on his trip. 
  Nor was the Semipalatinsk range "sold," Nazarbayev 
asseverated -- there was talk exclusively of U.S. technical 
assistance in conducting the necessary scientific research there 
into the consequences of nuclear tests and of giving assistance 
in rehabilitating the territory and the population affected by 
them. 
  With regard to the strategic missiles which are to be 
dismantled Nazarbayev confirmed that Kazakhstan is reckoning 
only on compensation for the value of the highly enriched 
uranium which constitutes the main "filling" of nuclear warheads. 
  According to the president of Kazakhstan, there was no need 
for Bill Clinton to convince his guest of the need to construct 
an oil pipeline from Tengiz to Novorossiysk, its construction is 
already close to completion, and Russia is one of the full 
participants in the construction. The planned capacity of the 
Novorossiysk oil pipeline, however, is just 17 million tonnes of 
oil a year, whereas, according to estimates, Kazakhstan intends 
to export 50-60 million tonnes from the North Caspian regions. 
If we look into the 21st century, Nazarbayev said, of course we 
cannot manage with this oil pipeline alone, and it is becoming 
simply essential to construct a large-capacity oil pipeline to 
the south, across Turkey and Iran, with an outlet not just to 
the Black Sea but also to the Persian Gulf. 
  Nazarbayev particularly emphasized that no documents 
directed 
against any third countries were examined or signed during his 
visit -- they all concerned exclusively bilateral relations 
between Kazakhstan and the United States. He also asseverated 
that neither Kazakhstan's enforced departure from the ruble zone 
nor any other circumstances had made him betray the principles 
of integration among the former components of the USSR which he 
has upheld throughout recent years: "Nazarbayev has not changed 
and will not change. At least not in this life. Whatever the 
press might say, Russia remains our top-priority, chief 
partner." Just a little later he made a proviso: "True, it 
does take two to tango. For proper cooperation willingness on 
the part of the partner is also necessary."

  [Text] Almaty February 23 TASS -- Kazakhstan is striving to 
get involved heavier in the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). This will be promoted by the 
opening of Kazakhstan's diplomatic missions in more European 
countries. 
  This was mentioned during a meeting on Tuesday between 
Kazakhstan Vice-President Eric Asanbayev [name and title as 
received] and CSCE Secretary-General Wilhelm Hoeynck who arrived 
in Almaty for a working visit. The sides agreed that more 
effort should be exerted to put a stop to conflicts in Central 
Asia, specifically in Tajikistan. 
  On the same day Wilhelm Hoeynck met with Kazakh Foreign 
Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov. It was noted during the 
conversation that following a meeting in Rome of foreign 
ministers of CSCE participating countries, new sovereign states 
in Central Asia, also Kazakhstan, strengthen their relations 
with that international organisation and are involved in joint 
work with CSCE. 
  In the Friendship House in the evening, Wilhelm Hoeynck met 
with representatives of non-governmental and public 
organisations and the media and answered their questions. 
  The CSCE secretary-general leaves for Bishkek on Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Kazak: "Democratic Forces Are Uniting </F>
in Order To Win"] 
  [Text] Democratic and patriotic forces of the Republic of 
Belarus held a consultative conference on 21 February. The 
conference discussed the possibilities for uniting all 
democratic forces in the Republic and coordinating their 
activities with regard to the upcoming presidential elections. 
  The representatives of parties which participated in the 
conference almost unanimously spoke in favor of dismissing the 
government and holding early elections, as well as for the need 
to unify democratic forces of Belarus. 
  According to the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly, if 
the united democratic forces can put forward one common 
candidate for the post of president, they will have a far better 
chance of winning in a coalition than if they campaign one by 
one or compete with each other. 
  The proposal was made to create a staff for supporting the 
common candidate, as well as to begin raising funds for the 
election campaign since, according to parties participating in 
the conference, all information media are almost entirely under 
government control. This opinion was also shared by Stanislav 
Shushkevich, who participated in the conference. The former 
Supreme Soviet chairman appealed to democratic forces to find a 
joint position with regard to three issues -- statehood, 
democracy, and commitment to market reforms. The specific date 
of the future elections -- 1 May 1994 -- was also mentioned at 
the conference. 
  The participants in the consultative conference agreed to 
meet in two weeks to discuss the principles of the alliance in a 
narrow circle.

<F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy Gyanadz Karpenka, by </F>
Alyaksey Syarhiyevskiy; place and date not given: "No More 
Confrontation!"] 
  [Text] [Syarhiyevskiy] The continuation of the session 
amounts to the continuation of the political strike. What is 
your attitude toward it? 
  [Karpenka] The decision to initiate a strike belongs to the 
workers and strike committees. If they believe that this can 
change the government's policy and improve the lives of their 
families, they are free to choose any form of fighting for their 
rights that does not contradict the constitution. There is 
hardly anybody today who believes that working people have no 
cause to worry about their current and especially their future 
situation. Prices are growing; social guarantees equal zero; 
pensioners are poverty stricken; the economy is on the verge of 
collapse. Once we presume that this is a normal state of 
things, then of course strikes are groundless. In my opinion, 
it is very bad that some political activists and officials who 
have been paying lip-service to protecting people's rights, 
reacted very negatively to workers' actions and resorted to 
indecent and rough attacks against those who, unlike these 
officials, are living through hard times. At the same time, I 
feel sorry that people from various political parties have been 
trying to win control over just and rightful action launched by 
the workers, and "reap profits" for their own needs. With 
regard to the eventual scenario of the strike, I believe that if 
the economic decline is accompanied by officials' passiveness, 
as has been done thus far, the number of those dissatisfied will 
continue to grow. 
  [Syarhiyevskiy] Today, the Belarusian leaders do not conceal 
that they believe a union with Russia is the only possible way 
to overcome the crisis. What is your opinion? 
  [Karpenka] Three and even two years ago we could have chosen 
alternate ways of building an independent economy. However, the 
Supreme Soviet overtly ignored economic problems and this, along 
with a certain inactivity on the part of the government, has led 
to stagnation and then, a crisis that may become a catastrophe. 
The issue is very complex and that is why I would like to be 
brief. We will not be able to do without a close economic union 
with Russia. Here are two examples from my work as chairman of 
the Molodechno City Council. By means of direct "negotiations" 
with Russian entrepreneurs, we received fuel and the city was 
able to live through the winter. It is quite warm in houses, 
schools, and hospitals. Now, we are thinking about the future 
and again, Russians are our only hope, because we are holding 
talks on purchasing flour from the farmers of Kuban. By 
projecting the problems of Molodechno on the entire state, we 
come to the conclusion that Belarus is closely intertwined with 
Russia. However, while signing any agreements and joining any 
unions, we should first of all think about the nation and not 
ourselves, and remember that our state is the only place that we 
have and that was given to us by God. Our grandchildren will 
not forgive us if we give up independence and sovereignty. 
Meanwhile, we see that certain political groups in both Belarus 
and Russia, including some Duma deputies, want this to happen. 
  [Syarhiyevskiy] What does the session have in store for us? 
  [Karpenka] I believe that it will put an end to senseless 
confrontation that has undermined the electorate's trust in the 
deputies' corps. We should honestly analyze the results of our 
work, adopt a constitution, and dissolve the legislature.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Kuts: "From Mutual Rights to Mutual </F>
Obligations"] 
  [Text] A draft agreement on border issues, which was 
discussed by the heads of Russian and Belarusian border 
departments [as published] in Minsk in mid-February, can become 
a basic document for further regulations of relations between 
both countries, including the issues concerning the external CIS 
borders. 
  If the internal CIS borders are to block a free transfer of 
goods and services, then the economic union proclaimed by CIS 
state heads will be devoid of all sense. With regard to this, 
the need for safe protection of the CIS external borders 
emerges, thus providing relations between both countries with a 
greater mutual responsibility. Now, while protecting the 
borders with the non-CIS countries, Belarus will protect not 
only its national interests, but also Russian ones. The Russian 
Federation will commit itself to analogous obligations. The 
question regards a quite different type of relations between the 
two states. These relations, as is assumed, will evolve from a 
system of mutual rights to a system of mutual obligations, which 
will help to save significant material means.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 Feb -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
addressed the Ingush and Chechen peoples on the anniversary 
today of the deportation of these peoples in 1944. The press 
service of the President of the Russian Federation has 
distributed the text of this address: 
  Address to the Ingush and Chechen peoples: Esteemed 
compatriots! Today, on the tragic anniversary of the deportation 
50 years ago of the Ingush and Chechen peoples, I offer you my 
sincere condolences and sympathy. The Ingush and the Chechens 
became the victims of the criminal arbitrary measures taken by 
Stalin and Beriya. It is particularly incredible that it took 
place when the best sons of the Vaynakh people were displaying 
their heroism and loyalty to their patriotic duty alongside 
other peoples of Russia at the front in the Great Patriotic War. 
  It is also a terrible truth that totalitarianism implanted 
"delayed-action mines" in interethnic relations. Unfortunately, 
they have started to explode in our times of nascent democratic 
change. This is especially felt in the case of the 
Ossetian-Ingush tragedy. I mourn with you over the victims of 
the armed conflict, and share the grief of those who have lost 
family and close ones, who are looking for a roof over their 
heads. 
  I want to assure you that it has been and remains my goal 
and 
concern to eradicate the grave consequences of the tragic 
events. With this in mind, I signed a decree on 13 December 
1993, the main aim of which was to return refugees and deportees 
to their original place of abode. 
  We are firmly on the road to thorough democratic 
transformation, to creating a genuinely lawful, humane Russian 
state. We are coming up against quite a few obstacles and 
problems, one of which is the unresolved nationalities issue, 
whose seriousness, even existence, were practically ignored 
before. 
  The Northern Caucasus, where dozens of peoples live in a 
small area, remains the most difficult region today in this 
respect. But problems can only be solved by political means, 
with armed force ruled out. 
  I am convinced that democratic Russia is capable of 
resolving 
any issue for the sake of a better future for its peoples and 
for each citizen. One confirmation of this is the Law "On the 
Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples", which lays down the legal 
bases for the restoration of historic justice. 
  The federal bodies of state power have directed much effort 
at improving the situation in the Northern Caucasus. The right 
of the Ingush and Chechen peoples to an independent national 
state system in the Russian Federation has been restored. They 
have been given the same opportunities for development as other 
peoples of the Russian Federation on the basis of the rights and 
freedoms guaranteed in the Russian Federation Constitution. 
  The situation now is that you yourselves must move forward 
towards national revival in all spheres of public life by 
patiently settling disputed issues with your neighbors on the 
basis of mutual accord. You can count on the help and 
wholehearted support of the Russian president, the federal 
bodies of state power and of all peoples of the Russian 
Federation. 
  I am convinced that it is only through democracy and firm 
constitutional law and order, without legal excesses or 
lawlessness, but using the wise traditions of Caucasian peoples 
tested over centuries, that peace and interethnic accord can be 
achieved in the North Caucasian region along with calm and 
wellbeing in every Ingush and Chechen family.

  [Text] Mourning ceremonies devoted to the 50th anniversary 
of the coercive deportation of the Chechen and Ingush peoples by 
the Stalin regime to Siberia and Central Asia were held on 
Wednesday [23 February] in Chechnya. 
  A memorial devoted to deportation victims was opened in 
Groznyy, the Chechen capital. About 5000 stones taken from 
cemeteries and used for road construction and other purposes 
after the Chechens' deportation in 1994 are in the center of 
this memorial. 
  Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev addressed several 
thousand 
Groznyy residents and citizens from other regions of the 
republic after a mourning and public prayer ceremony. He said 
that more than 600,000 Chechens and Ingushes perished during the 
deportation period. 
  A military parade took place in Svoboda Square in front of 
the presidential palace in the center of Groznyy. Dudayev 
commanded the parade. 
  The coffin with the body of Georgia's late ex-president 
Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia was carried on an artillery gun-carriage via the 
square before the parade. The coffin was placed in the marble 
hall of the House of Government. Gamsakhurdia's burial ceremony 
is scheduled for 15:00 local time on Thursday, February 24.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 23 Feb -- Vladimir Shumeyko, the chairman of 
the Federation Council, expressed a suggestion that this year a 
treaty may be signed between the Russian Federation and 
Chechnya, which is similar to the one with Tatarstan. Answering 
journalists' questions at today's "round table" on the situation 
in the Caucasus, he reported that the upper chamber of the 
parliament plans to hold parliamentary hearings in connection 
with the situation in the Caucasus, and all the sides will be 
invited there. "We want to hear all points of view, to weigh 
them up and to find our position," he noted. 
  According to the speaker, the issue of mutual relations 
between North Ossetia and Ingushetiya is complex, it touches not 
just on their interests, but also the problems of settling the 
situation in neighboring regions, in particular in South Ossetia 
and Georgia. As to Chechnya, this problem is "extremely complex 
and delicate." According to Vladimir Shumeyko, one needs to take 
into consideration the fact that the Chechen Republic has been 
existing for two years, and it has a publicly elected president. 
Now, he reported, a process is being observed, when the people 
are looking for ways out of the situation which has been formed. 
Not everyone believes that Chechnya should exist outside 
Russia. He also reported that the republic has public movements 
and a Provisional Council of the Chechen Republic that aim at 
resolving the issue of the coexistence of Chechnya and the 
Russian Federation. After the treaty with Tatarstan is 
concluded, one should focus all efforts on resolving the issue 
with Chechnya, the parliamentarian stressed. Russia stands only 
to gain from signing a treaty with Chechnya." 
  Commenting on the treaty with Tatarstan, Vladimir Shumeyko 
noted that he "does not see a threat in it." He hopes that in 
March elections will be held in Tatarstan, and two deputies will 
join the Federation Council. The treaty with Tatarstan "is 
executed in strict agreement with the Russian Constitution and 
the Federation Treaty," he stressed. The speaker warned against 
the opinion that "if a treaty is being concluded with a member 
of the Federation, then that member is leaving the Federation." 
"All it means is that new relations are being formed within the 
Federation at a different level", he concluded.

<F P=106> [Viktor Drozd report: "Leonid Kravchuk Is Not Afraid of </F>
Anything -- But He Does Not Intend To Run for the Post of 
President at the 26 June Elections"] 
  [Text] Kiev--In an interview for Radio "Liberty" (an 
excerpt of which was published in the newspaper DEMOKRATYCHNA 
UKRAYINA today), Leonid Kravchuk made a sensational 
announcement: He does not intend to fight for the post of 
president at the elections scheduled for 26 June this year. 
Leonid Makarovych explained his decision as follows: Given 
that it looks like the elections to the Supreme Council may 
require a second round [s pervogo zakhoda mogut i ne 
sostoyatsya], the "handing over of affairs" from the old 
parliament to the new threatens to drag on until May, and "then 
all structures would have to switch straight away to the 
presidential elections." The situation in Ukraine by this time, 
in Leonid Kravchuk's view, may be severely exacerbated. So is it 
worth getting bogged down in the presidential elections so soon? 
A complex situation, Leonid Kravchuk continued, can be 
rationalized, but to agree to participate in the elections would 
mean defending "that position -- economic and social -- which 
exists today." That is, trying to prove that it is normal. 
And, of course, those who run for the post of president will 
make every effort to prove that "I failed in my duties. I would 
then provide them with much room for political maneuver and all 
kinds of accusations." In answer to a question from "Liberty" 
journalists on whether it is possible that he is simply afraid 
of domestic strife, Leonid Kravchuk replied: "I am not 
afraid...." He added: "In principle, the concept of fear does 
not concern me as an individual." 
  It is, indeed, possible to agree with Leonid Makarovych's 
final point. His decision was most probably dictated not by 
fear, but by calculation. The number of battles he had to 
withstand last year when the miners were demanding a referendum 
on confidence in the president are still fresh in the memory. 
At that time Leonid Makarovych made considerable efforts, and 
even agreed to early elections -- provided that there was no 
referendum. The situation now is such that Kravchuk may not 
receive a vote of confidence at the upcoming elections. And 
does he really want to suffer "ignominious defeat" -- he who 
only recently proudly boasted that he had been party to the 
collapse of the Soviet Union? Especially as one of the 
"Belovezhskiy old guard" -- Stanislav Shushkevich -- has been 
ousted from office by the Belarusian Parliament. Nor, as some 
independent politicians and mass media sources assert, is Boris 
Yeltsin's position particularly firm. Here again, Leonid 
Makarovych has obviously weighed things up: It is better to 
jump from that runaway train by the name of "Ukraine" of one's 
own volition, than to fail at the presidential elections. 
  However, it is for Leonid Kravchuk to decide his own fate. 
It is only a pity that after such ardent words about respect 
for the people of Ukraine, the sovereignty of the people, and 
love for Ukraine, that the people themselves and Ukraine should 
have to learn of the president's decision from Radio 
"Liberty"....

  [Text] The Ukrainian presidential and government press 
office issued a statement explaining Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk's position with respect to the coming presidential 
elections in Ukraine. 
  According to the statement, President Kravchuk told a 
meeting 
with newsmen initiated by "Radio Liberty" and "Der Spiegel" 
about the situation in the country and said he considered his 
participation in the early presidential elections scheduled for 
June 26 1994 inexpedient. 
  Taking into account that the president's opinion has been 
widely commented on by both Ukrainian and foreign mass media, 
the press office points out that "this position of Kravchuk is 
caused by the specific situation in society and the state system 
today and prognoses of its short-term development." 
  The press office said the president motivated his decision 
by 
the fact that the period remaining until the elections is very 
short. "It cannot be ruled out that the process of electing and 
forming the supreme power bodies, both executive and 
legislative, may exceed the time limits set and overlap with the 
early presidential and local elections," the statement 
stipulates. 
  "This may lead to vacuum of power, when the Supreme Soviet 
is 
already no more, while a new one has not been created, a cabinet 
of ministers which could assume entire executive power has not 
yet been formed," according to the statement. 
  Under such circumstances, only the president can 
effectively exercise his powers. However, if he allows the 
elections at the moment, executive structures may break up and 
the control of the country lost, the statement stipulated. 
  "This is the president's main argument," the press office 
said.

<F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym </F>
Zvyahilskyy to a Supreme Council session on the economic and 
social situation in Ukraine -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, esteemed 
people's deputies! Let me inform you in accordance with 
yesterday's Supreme Council instruction about the course of 
implementing two resolutions, of 17th and 23rd December 1993. 
[passage omitted] Primarily, on the recurrent issue of 
index-linking the population's deposits in savings banks and 
insurance contributions to the former GosStrakh [State 
Insurance] institutions, as well as settling the debt in respect 
of the former Soviet Union's securities. We realize the urgency 
and acuteness of this issue in view of the lack of nonemissive 
sources to cover compensatory payments. 
  As a result of more in-depth work on the proposals put 
forward by people's deputies, citizens, and scientific 
establishments, the government has set up an interdepartmental 
working group of representatives of the Finance Ministry, 
Economy Ministry, Justice Ministry, Statistics Ministry, State 
Property Fund, National Bank, and the insurance company 
Harantor, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy. 
Specific proposals will be made ready by 2 March of this year. 
The commission has begun working. [passage omitted] 
  The next issue is that of the possibility of providing the 
population with the minimum selection of food products at fixed 
prices. Analysis shows fixing prices under the present 
conditions requires huge subsidizing funds to be set up to the 
amount of tens of trillions [as heard] karbovantsi. You all 
very well know our budgetary capabilities in this respect. 
Apart from that, to perform the functions of supervision and 
distribution centrally, the recreation of the former system of 
(?monitoring) and (?funding) will be required, i.e. virtually 
the recreation of the system of short supply. [passage omitted] 
  Another issue that has lately caused passions to flare is 
currency regulation. The government's position on this question 
is univocal: We are for the regulation of [currency exchange] 
rates, which has to take account of the state of the economy in 
real terms and, accordingly, the relationship between prices for 
the main types of products of both ours and those of our 
principal trade partners, as well as the state of the balance of 
payments in relations with them. 
  Together with the National Bank, we are constantly at work 
to 
improve the mechanism of currency regulation. That said, 
however, I would once again like to confirm the government's 
tough stance in that we will not agree to (?increasingly 
obtrusive) proposals effectively to restore the currency 
exchange activity. This in practice would legalize the 
speculative rate of the dollar, which would inevitably lead to 
prices rising steeply and the state of the economy destabilizing 
further. 
  I cannot comprehend the position of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs on this issue. Does it really 
reflect the interests of enterprises and labor collectives? 
Despite the fact that a lot has been done to implement the 
Supreme Council December resolutions, the state of the economy 
remains extremely complex, but at the same time, there is 
nothing new in it. We have come to it together, the Supreme 
Council, the government, dependent and independent trade unions, 
local presidential representatives, and managers of enterprises. 
  One thing I would like to ask you to do, however, is this: 
Let us finally stop looking for those to blame for the present 
state of affairs but honestly say that we are all to blame and 
that the economy has been taken hostage by our policies. 
  What should be done in this situation and how and where 
should a way out be found? The simplest thing is to take the 
position of wrathful denunciation, endlessly dramatize the 
situation, and undermine the remainder of the people's belief 
that the state of affairs can be rectified. There is, however, 
another approach, which is doing the heavy work, without 
gratitude, in search of ways to overcome the crisis and (?making 
an effort) to increase the creative potential despite all the 
problems and difficulties. [passage omitted] 
  So have we got any real opportunities to stabilize the 
situation? Firstly, we have to overcome the acute payments 
crisis in the national economy. It primarily reflects the state 
of the economy. Ineffective, high energy and resource 
consumption structural production, and serious drawbacks in the 
work of the banking system, as well as unstoppable cost and 
price rises, have aggravated the financial situation at 
enterprises, which under the inflation conditions has caused a 
catastrophic shortage of their working capital, the cessation of 
mutual settlements, lack of funds to pay wages, and a sharp fall 
in budget contributions. 
  There are, however, other things that caused the payments 
crisis. They have to do with the absence of elementary control 
by local authorities and banks over the timeliness and 
completeness of settlements. [passage omitted] 
  To solve the payment crisis, the government and the National 
Bank have found a compromise that makes it possible to begin to 
disentangle the nonpayment knot that was tied, insure the 
liquidity of commercial banks, and cause the actual movement of 
ready products to consumers, which would create conditions for 
the wages of enterprises's employees to be paid and payments to 
the budget insured. 
  The issue concerning the allocation of 1.5 trillion [figure 
as heard] karbovantsi to pay the pensions has been settled, 700 
billion to the wages of budgetary sectors' employees, grants, 
and benefits. Finances have also been provided for expenditure 
on the Chernobyl program, the Defense, Internal Affairs, and 
other ministries. 
  One has to bear it mind, however, that financial resources 
are not unlimited. To improve the health of the financial 
situation by unsecured financial injections is impossible. This 
is a path to inflation rocketing higher, prices rising, and 
production degrading even further. This is why I would like to 
say frankly, mainly to state enterprises managers, that we have 
approached the boundary, beyond which ineffective high resource 
consumption production facilities have to undergo the clearance 
of their funds [sanatsiya], specialize in another field, or 
close down. The government, of course, will for some time 
support and guarantee the social security of the collectives 
employed at these facilities. Everybody has to realize, however, 
that the only way for enterprises to earn profit, wages, and 
funds is by selling their products. 
  Second, the work of the agroindustrial complex and 
preparation for spring field work. I would like to note that 
last year's debts of the state [to the farmers] for the grain, 
sunflower, and sugar beet supplied, have been completely 
settled. At the same time, due to the payments crisis and 
insufficient sales of meat and diary products, there has formed 
a debt to producers from trade and processing enterprises to the 
amount of 1.5 trillion karbovantsi. This, in its turn, has 
caused a debt in terms of wages at collective agricultural 
enterprises to the amount of 1.3 trillion karbovantsi. Alongside 
of resolving the problem of nonpayments in the national economy, 
the issue of sale has to be settled. 
  Apart from that, 1 trillion karbovantsi worth of credits 
have 
been allocated to subsidized industrial centers and consumer 
cooperative organizations to purchase food and industry 
products. Within the framework of a government credit, 2 
trillion karbovantsi have been allocated mainly to purchasing 
petrol, oil and lubricants, fertilizers, spare parts, and other 
resources with the aim of financially backing the agroindustrial 
complex. Under the state contract the countryside will again 
receive around 2 trillion karbovantsi in March. [passage 
omitted] 
  An additional 2 million tonnes of white petroleum products 
has been bought, with 400,000 tonnes having already been 
received by now and sent to farms. It will have been 500,000 
tonnes by the end of the month. Fuel prices have been fixed, 
with farms being supplied with it on average at a price of 4 
million karbovantsi per tonne and the strictest control over its 
storage and use established. 
  Virtually all sowers, cultivators, and harrows have been 
made 
ready and the readiness of tractors is higher than last year, at 
over 80 percent. To purchase spare parts, 14.5 billion rubles 
and over 5.5 million German marks have been allocated. 
MinMashProm [Machine-Building Industry Ministry] has determined 
the volume of additional production to manufacture 1,600 
articles of spare parts previously imported. 
  Farms have been fully provided with seeds of grain, sugar 
beet, sunflower, potatoes, and most varieties of vegetables. To 
provide mineral fertilizers, MinSelHosProd [Agriculture and Food 
Industry Ministry] has been granted a government credit of over 
400 billion karbovantsi. [passage omitted] 
  Third, concerning the work of the fuel and energy complex: 
Last year an additional 3.6 million tonnes of coal were supplied 
by power industry workers than was envisaged by the plan. As 
regards the coke-oven industry, the plan was achieved. In order 
to stabilize the work of coal enterprises, measures were taken 
to increase supplies of timber, rubber belting strips, ropes, 
personal protection equipment, and other resources. Contracts 
have been signed for the delivery of 80 billion cubic meters of 
gas from Russia and Turkmenistan in 1994. Work is also underway 
on concluding agreements for the supply of oil and oil products. 
A new clearing system for gas has been introduced for 
enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and Ministry of 
Machine-building. It envisages that their enterprises will pay 
independently for gas supplied to them. A resolution has been 
adopted on state regulation in order to restrict the increase in 
prices for oil products. The government has practically 
established daily control over the work of thermal and nuclear 
power stations. This has enabled the work of Ukraine's energy 
system to be preserved and has prevented its collapse, thus 
avoiding catastrophic consequences in the country's economy. 
[passage omitted] 
  With the aim of stabilizing the work of sectors in the fuel 
and energy complex, we are preparing a range of measures to 
provide assistance particularly to those sectors. The building 
of new capacities for the production of electricity is being 
sought. The allocation of hard currency resources to purchase 
the necessary materials and equipment is envisaged. [passage 
omitted] 
  Fourth, trading relations with CIS and Baltic countries 
have a special place in our economic policy. These are the 
traditional markets for products manufactured by Ukrainian 
enterprises. As of today, intergovernmental agreements on trade 
and economic cooperation have been signed with all the former 
USSR states, apart from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. A list of 
the most important products and goods that are subject to mutual 
deliveries has been drawn up. With the aim of overcoming the 
crisis in mutual clearances, appropriate work is being carried 
out between the National Bank of Ukraine and the Central Banks 
of the former USSR republics. As of 1994 there are agreements 
on mutual clearances with the majority of these countries and 
work is continuing with banks of Azerbaijan, Belarus, Lithuania, 
and Moldova. Work is continuing on developing bilateral 
relations with CIS countries and in other areas where there is 
mutual interest. Thus, principles of cooperation have been 
determined with Kazakhstan in the area of heavy industry, with 
Uzbekistan in the area of elaborating innovations and 
scientifically intensive production processes, and the 
processing and exploitation of rare and precious metals, with 
Belarus on eliminating double taxation, and with three other 
states on the mutual protection of investments. 
  As before, we are paying particular attention and will 
continue to do so on the development of relations with the 
Russian Federation which is our main trading partner. Its share 
in Ukraine's foreign trade turnover is more than 72 percent. I 
recently returned from Moscow and would like to inform the 
Supreme Council of the complete mutual understanding reached 
during the talks between Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets, Fuel and 
Energy Minister Shafranik, and other members of the Russian 
Federation's Government. Apart from us Russia, is also actively 
in favor of developing bilateral cooperation. We have found 
mutually beneficial possibilities for paying off our debts for 
energy resources. We agreed on a pricing mechanism for oil and 
oil products depending on its quality and delivery conditions. 
  With the aim of developing mutually advantageous and 
long-term cooperation regarding exports of Russian natural gas 
to Ukraine and its transit through our territory, a draft 
intergovernmental agreement for the years 1994/2005 has been 
prepared. [passage omitted] 
  By way of conclusion I would like to say that the government 
is aware of the acuteness and the difficult situation in the 
country's economy. There are no illusions with regard to the 
simplicity of the issue and understanding the painfulness of 
those decisions that have to be taken on the path of overcoming 
the crisis. In carrying out the duties of acting prime minister 
and the government, we can see ways of stabilizing the situation 
and are doing everything possible in order to achieve this. 
Thank you for your attention.

  [Text] Kiev--The Supreme Council of Ukraine recently 
ratified the Consular Convention between Ukraine and the Russian 
Federation that was signed on 15 January 1993 during President 
of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Moscow, said Natalya 
Zarudna, the head of department of the Information Directorate 
at Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry, at a briefing on 22 
February. The Russian Federal Assembly has not ratified the 
document yet. 
  The consular convention is based on the principles of the 
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963. It is 
a bilateral agreement that supplements the principles of this 
multilateral international legal act. The convention determines 
the procedure for the establishment of consular offices and 
appointment of consular officials; consular functions, benefits 
for consular officials and their rights and duties as to the 
protection of their citizens' interests. 
  According to Natalya Zarudna, the ratification of the 
convention will promote the establishment and development of 
Ukrainian-Russian consular relations, as well as the protection 
of rights and interests of Ukrainian and Russian citizens. 
Ukraine has already signed such conventions with China, 
Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Kazakhstan.

<F P=106> [Article by L. Ryabchikov: "Parties Prepared To Help </F>
President"] 
  [Text] President Yuriy Meshkov dedicated last Saturday to 
talks with leaders of officially registered parties. During the 
course of the discussions, they clarified their positions and 
their attitudes toward the president's program for 
transformations in the republic, and they explained what help 
they needed. The leaders of the parties, including the PEVK 
[expansion unknown] and Ukrainian parties, declared their 
readiness to contribute to the implementation of the economic 
reforms. 
  "The meeting took place in a constructive setting," said the 
deputy chairman of the Agrarian Party, Mikhail Frolov. "We are 
in favor of social justice for the peasantry and granting them 
the benefits necessary for the advancement of agriculture. The 
president's views coincide with ours here." 
  "We came to the meeting with a package of proposals," said 
the chairman of the Party of Social Guarantees, Yefim Fiks, "and 
in turn we received a proposal from the president to prepare 
draft edicts for them." 
  Participants in the meeting spoke of the need to adopt a 
joint statement of all political forces of the republic in 
support of the president's actions. 
  Commenting on the results of the talks, the president's 
adviser for communications with parties and public 
organizations, Sergey Nikulin, noted that Yuriy Meshkov asked 
the participants in the meetings to prepare proposals for 
candidates for vacancies in all structures of state power. The 
consolidation, Nikulin thinks, will make it possible to create a 
powerful bloc supporting the president's policy in the new 
parliament. This will be a parliament of a new quality, he 
emphasized.

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS -- "For the first time, 
Russia has a specific programme of development", Vladimir 
Shumeyko, speaker of the Federation Council, said, commenting on 
the Russian president's message to the Federal Assembly. In an 
interview to ITAR-TASS he said that the discussion of Boris 
Yeltsin's message is put by deputies of the upper chamber of 
parliament on the agenda of its third meeting that opened on 
Thursday. 
  The main directions of the consolidation of the Russian 
state 
indicated by the president will undoubtedly have an effect on a 
plan of legislative work that the chamber will endorse at its 
current meeting, the speaker believes. 
  In an interview to ITAR-TASS, deputy of the State Duma, 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said that the presidential 
message should be used as the guide for adjusting normal 
mechanisms of market relations. Shokhin believes that the state 
authorities are capable of doing so. 
  The problem of Russians who constitute the absolute majority 
of the population, 83 per cent, has been raised for the first 
time in the presidential message. Commenting on this section of 
the message, Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional 
Policy Sergey Shakhray told ITAR-TASS that "all politicians 
should be constantly aware that there is direct relationship 
between a sense of well-being of the Russian people and that of 
all other peoples in the federation". 
  Shakhray said that the forming of the Russian nation should 
not be in the imperial spirit, at the expense of the interests 
of other peoples. The Russian state is a form of 
self-determination of all its ethnic groups with guarantees of 
the development of each of them. 
  Regarding Russians' positions in former union republics, 
Shakhray said that Russia has juridical obligations to them, 
also under international law. As the successor of the USSR, 
Russia must protect citizens under its jurisdiction who live 
outside Russian boundaries. 
  Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev believes that 
virtually every deputy went along with the Russian president's 
message to the Federal Assembly. It is now essential to embark 
on its implementation and to continue the economic reforms, he 
told ITAR-TASS on Thursday. 
  Tatarstan's president supported the Russian president's 
attitude that decentralisation of russian economy is needed. He 
believes that important economic matters should be tackled 
locally.

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS--President Yeltsin's address 
to the Federal Assembly "contains a rather powerful potential 
for putting into effect now the main guidelines of the domestic 
and foreign policy, which is the constitutional duty of the 
president," Aleksandr Yakovlev, official representative of 
President Yeltsin in parliament, told ITAR-TASS. 
  In his opinion, those guidelines should now be translated 
into legislative acts and in the steps to be taken by executive 
authorities. Then they will really become "actions with 
tangible results." 
  Yakovlev stressed that the putting into effect of the main 
guidelines is the task for all branches of authority. 
Legislation and its subsequent implementation should be the 
next stage. 
  The presidential address pointed to the absence of 
uniformity 
in the economic legislation and stressed that "a breakthrough in 
providing legal support for the market-oriented reform is 
urgently needed."

  [Text] Moscow February 24 -- Russian Prosecutor-General 
Aleksey Kazannik expressed his approval of President Yeltsin's 
emphasis on the strengthening of the Russian state, law and 
order, and the fight against crime, as expressed in the 
president's first annual address to the Federal Assembly. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Kazannik noted that, "Boris 
Yeltsin perfectly correctly laid out a plan of legislative work. 
Without that it will be impossible to ensure law and order". 
  The procurator-general said he was sure that, after the 
adoption of the anti-crime programme which the Russian president 
is now intensively working on, law and order bodies will find it 
much easier to increase the strength of laws in the Russian 
society. 
  The president's address emphasized that, "A law-based state 
should be a strong one in order to guarantee peoples' safety, 
strike out against crime, and begin an offensive against 
corruption. A strong state is the basis for the continuation of 
reforms, the overcoming of the country's crisis, the 
establishment of basic economic restructuring, and the creation 
of conditions for economic stabilisation and growth". 
  It was also noted in the address that, "In a law-based 
state, 
power is limited by the law, which is a necessary condition for 
such a state. For that exact reason the development of law can 
be considered a concrete policy towards the strengthening of the 
Russian state".

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- The organisers of the 
armed opposition revolt last October in Moscow may be soon freed 
from the Lefortovo investigation prison, however they will spend 
this night in jail. 
  TASS learned from the Office of the Russian Prosecutor 
General on Wednesday that the decision of the State Duma to 
pardon the revolt organisers is an order for authorities as, 
according to the new Russian Constitution, the Duma is the 
supreme legislative body in issues of amnesty. 
  However, the Prosecutor's Office has not yet received the 
necessary documents from the Duma and cannot thus free the 
Lefortovo prisoners. 
  All activities will most evidently begin tommorrow, 
according 
to the Prosecutor's Office. 
  The pardoned organisers include former Vice-President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, Former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, 
diehard opposition members Ilya Konstantinov and Viktor Anpilov, 
as well as other resolute opponents of the Russian president. 
  The Prosecutor's Office said they know about the Duma 
decision thanks to radio broadcasts and some of them had 
meetings with lawyers and relatives on Wednesday.

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS--Russian Prosecutor General 
Alexey Kazannik is ready to free anti-Yeltsin rebels pardoned by 
the State Duma on Wednesday as soon as he receives the necessary 
documents from the legislature and talks to each of the 
organisers of the October armed opposition revolt and hard-line 
May Day demonstration last year. 
  "In case the accused agree with the (Duma) resolution I 
shall 
rule to drop criminal proceedings against each of the accused", 
Kazannik told TASS on Thursday. 
  If the accused refuse to be pardoned the criminal cases 
against them will proceed in a usual way, he added. 
  Kazannik said he had not yet received the Duma decision, but 
stressed that his office does not give political assessments to 
various laws. "It ensures lawfulness and a strict fulfillment of 
all instructions of competent state bodies", he said.

  [Text] The amnesty resolution does not amount to an 
immediate release of those involved in last October's events, 
sources close to former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy told 
Interfax. 
  They say the process may take several months to implement 
despite the resolution's demand for an immediate release of 
Lefortovo prison inmates. 
  One source said the main problem was how to enforce the 
resolution in a legal way. Nor is clear how the Duma's 
constitutional prerogative of declaring amnesties will be 
interpreted, he said. The source says that the amnesty covers 
those convicted but not those under investigation or trial which 
gives a wide room for legal interpretation of the Duma 
resolution. Even if experts arrive at a conclusion that the 
prisoners must be set free immediately, there is always a chance 
of delaying the resolution indefinitely for various reasons such 
as failure to return a book borrowed from the prison library, he 
said.

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS--The Russian State Duma 
confused "pardoning" with "amnesty" and thus the Russian 
president may annul its decision to free opposition rebels 
because pardoning is his exclusive right, while the lower 
chamber can only declare an amnesty, according to an aide of the 
Russian leader. 
  "The State Duma replaced the notion of `pardoning' by 
`amnesty' thus exceeding its authority. According to the 
Russian Constitution pardoning is the right of the president", 
national security aide Yuriy Baturin told TASS on Thursday. 
  He explained that there is a big difference between 
"pardoning" and "amnesty". An amnesty frees people convicted 
for certain crimes, while only concrete people can be pardoned. 
  Baturin also said that the Duma decision is contradicting 
the 
principles of law because "there are dead bodies while there are 
nobody guilty". He was referring to over 140 killed during the 
October revolt and the policeman killed during the May Day 
demonstration last year. 
  He stressed that the principle of power sharing between 
authorities had also been violated as, according to the 
Constitution, it is only the court which can decide whether 
defendants are guilty or not. "Thus it would be better to wait 
with pardoning until a court verdict", Baturin said. 
  The national security aide believes the Constitutional Court 
could have helped in the dispute. "But as the law on its 
activities has not been adopted yet, the president, as the 
guarantor of the Constitution has the right to demand that the 
office of the prosecutor general and heads of departments do not 
fulfill the resolution of the State Duma which does not abide by 
the principles of the Constitution and Russian laws", Baturin 
said. 
  He added that the Russian prosecutor general may file a 
protest against the Duma decision which, according to the law, 
is to be considered by the lower chamber. 
  In Baturin's personal opinion the Duma decision was "a 
political-emotional act, rather that a juridical step".

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS--Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will react calmly to the Duma decision to pardon his 
opponents, according to presidential spokesman Vyacheslav 
Kostikov. 
  "The president will react calmly, without emotions. He will 
give a moral assessment of the event", Vyacheslav Kostikov told 
reporters on Thursday. 
  However, the spokesman himself believes the implementation 
of 
the Duma decision would result in "a serious destabilisation", 
will be detrimental to Russian national interests and will 
affect the foreign policy. 
  Kostikov hinted that the amnesty to rebels may not be 
implemented because of a "possible war of juridical 
interpretations". 
  "If the Constitution says that the State Duma declares 
amnesty it does not mean that it adopts a decision on it", 
Kostikov said adding that "the amnesty in its political part is 
immoral" because it frees those who are responsible for the 
death of people.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 February -- The decision of the State 
Duma on granting amnesty to the members of the SCSE [State 
Committee for the State of Emergency] and those involved in the 
October 1993 events is a challenge to Russian democracy. The 
feelings of the millions of Russians who defended democracy in 
August 1991 and in October 1993 have been trampled on. In 
initiating the adoption of this decision the Communists and 
supporters of Zhirinovskiy displayed a total unity of aims of 
getting into power by a destabilization of the situation. This 
is said in a statement issued by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the 
Russian president's press secretary. 
  There is no doubt that this decision will harm cooperation 
between the branches of power and the very idea of law and order 
because it elevates a resolution of the issue of the guilt of 
those involved in both coups from the legal to the political 
sphere. This decision is of a purely political nature -- it was 
adopted hastily, without taking the account of public opinion 
and without a preliminary research into the legal foundations 
for adopting and implementing such serious decisions. 
  At the time when the Russian president is taking decisive 
steps to reaffirm Russia's prestige and dignity in the world, 
the State Duma is making decisions which will lead to 
destabilization, and consequently, to the weakening of Russia. 
This path is dangerous and it goes against national interests. 
All the responsibility for the consequences of the adopted 
decision lies with the State Duma, and with those who initiated 
and carried out this action, the statement of the Russian 
president's press secretary says.

  The statement released by the press center to the media says 
that Vyacheslav Kostikov's statement "casts a shadow over the 
emerging constructive cooperation between the State Duma and the

consolidating all power structures and political forces, and

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS--An aide of the Russian 
president characterised the Duma decision to pardon anti-Yeltsin 
rebels as "dashing and poorly thought out" and added that the 
new Russian Constitution will not allow them to resume 
activities. 
  Member of the Presidential Council Leonid Smirnyagin told 
TASS on Wednesday that the people who the Duma pardoned can 
never change. 
  "Such people as (hard-liner) Ilya Konstantinov are 
untamable, 
do not cede to the reasons of history and will again try to 
unite the irreconcilable under their banner", he said. 
  However, Smirnyagin added that since the new Russian 
Constitution has been adopted "it leaves no room for (Ruslan) 
Khasbulatov and (Aleksandr) Rutskoy in the new Russian 
statehood". 
  The Constitution envisages no post of the vice-president. 
  Smirnyagin added that the Duma decision "doubts the 
political 
morality of deputies".

Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko told reporters on

  He stressed that the organisers are not political, but

  The revolt organisers face criminal charges and it is only 
the court which can make the final verdict, according to 
Shumeyko who said that his upper chamber does not plan to

  [Text] The decision on the political amnesty of the SCSE 
[State Committee for the State of Emergency] members and the 
participants in the October events is completely in keeping with 
the Constitution from a judicial point of view. This was stated 
by Aleksandr Yakovlev, the official representative of the 
Russian president at the Federal Assembly today. However, he 
noted, the political and social aspects in this case are more 
important than the judicial one. He thinks that an act on 
amnesty may create a false illusion of hopes for civic peace.

  [Text] According to the leader of Russian Communists, 
Gennadiy Zyuganov, political amnesty should become the prelude 
to nation-wide reconciliation. He declared this in his 
interview with Interfax in the Kremlin on Thursday. 
  He believes that a civil war "has been going on in Russia 
for 
a long time already," thousands of killed, millions of refugees, 
more than 15 Mn people with incomes far below the subsistence 
minimum are victims of this war. 
  In connection with this, Zyuganov pointed to the following 
historical parallel -- after the civil war of 1917-1920, 
national reconciliation in Russia took place only in 1941 when 
"the people willy-nilly had to struggle for their survival." 
Zyuganov believes that "today the situation is reminiscent of 
this historical parallel." 
  Zyuganov pointed out that the president and government 
should 
express their point of view regarding the amnesty. "This is not 
an issue about which only press secretaries can speak," he noted. 
  Zyuganov believes that liberation of the participants of the 
August 1991 and October 1993 events "will not bring any sharp 
destabilization into the nation's political life." "As a matter 
of fact, such people as Lukyanov, Kryuchkov, that is, people who 
enjoy a great political reputation, and are quite experienced, 
have been freed and they are productively working in Russia's 
favor," he said. 
  "We rule out the notion of "revenge" as a political term," 
noted Zyuganov. A State Duma deputy Aleksandr Nevzorov, a 
prominent TV journalist, who was nearby, declared: "We have 
granted amnesty not only to those who participated in the 1991 
and 1993 events on both sides but by means of this act we have 
granted amnesty to Yeltsin himself."

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
voted on Wednesday to declare amnesty to organisers of two 
hard-line coups and a demonstration all which resulted in 
bloodshed in Moscow. 
  Lawmakers voted 253-67 for the resolution on amnesty which 
comes into effect at the moment of publication and is to be 
implemented in six months. 
  The amnesty covers, besides businessmen convicted in Soviet 
years, also organisers of the 1991 abortive Soviet coup, the 
leaders of hard-line opposition revolt last October in Moscow, 
as well as organisers of the hard-line demonstration last May 
which clashed with police. The leaders in question include 
former Soviet top officials now facing trial, arrested former 
parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov and former Vice-President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, as well as diehard opposition members Viktor 
Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov and others. 
  "This is the beginning of a civil war in Russia", Sergey 
Yushchenkov, chairman of the Duma Committee on Defence commented. 
  He accused Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin of promoting such a vote 
by ignoring many lawmakers who wanted to speak against it. 
  Rybkin told the Duma before the vote that the amnesty was 
necessary to "escape from suspicion, gloating expectations of 
certain changes and possible settling of accounts". 
  "We are destined to accord to get out of the crisis", he 
said. 
  "The Duma is firmly convinced that Russia needs civic peace, 
accord and construction to get out of the crisis. Russians 
await from us such an accord and interaction between the 
president, the Federation Council, the State Duma and the 
Constitutional Court", he added.

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- The decision of the 
Russian State Duma to declare amnesty to anti-Yeltsin rebels on 
the eve of the presidential address to parliament is "an open 
symbolic challenge" to the president, according to Emil Pain, an 
aide of the Russian leader, who added that Yeltsin would not 
approve the decision. 
  The amnesty "puts a constructive dialogue (between the 
president and the parliament) under big doubt", Pain told TASS 
on Wednesday adding that it would not promote stability in 
society either. 
  However, he stressed that the Duma decision should not 
postpone the presidential address as it is a message "not only 
to the Federal Assembly, but to the whole society". 
  On Wednesday the Duma overwhelmingly voted to declare an 
amnesty to organisers of the 1991 Soviet coup, of the armed 
opposition revolt in Moscow last year and of the hard-line 
demonstration in May 1993. All the three events resulted in 
bloodshed. 
  Pain, who is a member of the Presidential Council, regretted 
that the faction headed by Sergey Shakhray also voted to pardon 
the rebels. "It is regretful that the amnesty for political 
adventurists was supported by the faction with the name of 
"Russian Unity and Accord".

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- Russian nationalist 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was brief in assessing the Duma 
decision to pardon anti-Yeltsin rebels on Wednesday. 
  "This is a historic moment. February 23, 1994 means an end 
to civil war in Russia", he told reporters. 
  However, a leader of another major Duma faction is of a 
completely opposite opinion. Sergey Yushchenkov of the Russia's 
Choice said the amnesty to rebels means "the beginning of a 
civil war in Russia". 
  Yegor Gaydar, the leader of the faction, said the decision 
was a move towards destabilisation and warned that the freed 
rebels would return to their activities which would result in a 
new bloodshed. "I am completely convinced that they would work 
so that new blood is shed", he said. 
  According to Gaydar, the president cannot veto the Duma 
decision. 
  Other Duma factions were somewhere in between the radical 
points of view of Russia's Choice and Zhirinovskiy's party. 
  Sergey Stankevich from the Party of Russian Unity and Accord 
said that Russia has got a chance for reconciliation, but warned 
that "it is hard to predict how the chance would be used". 
  Leader of Russian Communists Gennadiy Zyuganov told TASS 
that 
he has a "feeling of certain satisfaction" as agreement has been 
reached among most Duma factions. The Russia's Choice remained 
alone "and began to immediately intimidate by provocations", he 
said. 
  Vladimir Lysenko from the "Yabloko" bloc abstained from the 
vote. He told TASS that it was very tempting to vote for 
universal pardoning, however "if a considerable part of 
extremists is freed this can destabilise the situation".

  [Text] Leader of the Russia's Choice [RC] group Yegor 
Gaydar is "absolutely convinced that the amnesty resolution 
which also covers those involved in the events of August 1991 
and September-October 1993 is a step to unsettling the situation 
in Russia". 
  Speaking on Wednesday, Gaydar said all those people were 
most 
likely "to take newly-formed militant units to the streets in 
the next few months and I am sure there will be renewed 
violence". 
  The RC leader also said that under the new constitution, the 
president has no powers to veto the Duma resolution. 
  One other RC leader Gennadiy Burbulis who also voted against 
the resolution said: "It is very enticing to speak in terms of 
civic peace or being destined for accord but there is great 
concern when such noble ideas are being resolved with political 
impropriety and legal incorrectness". 
  For his part, Communist Party chief Gennadiy Zyuganov said 
the amnesty for those imprisoned on charges of involvement in 
last October's events meant that those people "who defended the 
Constitution will now be able to do so not in Lefortovo Prison 
but in normal conditions". 
  One other Communist deputy and defendant in the case of the 
1991 failed coup Anatoliy Lukyanov told Interfax that the 
amnesty resolution was "a logical step on the way to internal 
stability". However, he is perfectly sure that there can be "no 
genuine reconciliation unless the government changes its policy 
by dropping shock treatment of the economy". 
  Lukyanov does not believe that the situation will go out of 
hand just because about 50 prisoners will be released and 
charges against them dropped. 
  In his view, leader of the right-wing Russian National Unity 
Aleksandr Barkashov and leader of the Russian Workers' Communist 
Party Viktor Anpilov "had enough time for a rethink to prevent 
what happened from being repeated". "I am sure that fascist 
ideas will not work here", Lukyanov said. 
  LDP [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy has described the Duma resolution as "a historic 
moment of reconciliation and shedding the burden of historic 
mistakes". In a speech to the Duma, he called to close "dark 
pages and express sympathy and forgive all victims". 
  At the same time, Zhirinovskiy called on the president "not 
to sabotage the Duma resolution" and the government to take 
measures to enforce it. 
  One other deputy Vasiliy Lipitskiy says that former Vice 
President Aleksandr Rutskoy will again lead the People's Party 
of Free Russia when set free. 
  For his part, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord 
Sergey Shakhray stressed that he and the PRUC were opposed to 
spreading the amnesty for those "taking up arms and perpetrating 
criminal offences during the events of last September and 
October".

  [Text] Moscow February 23 (TASS) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin met on Wednesday with the acting chairman of the Russian 
Constitutional Court, Nikolay Vitruk, to discuss some key 
problems. 
  Vitruk told the president that at the Council of Europe's 
request prompted by Russia's intention to apply for a full 
membership in this organization, he was going to deliver on 
February 25 a report on the new Russian Constitution to experts 
of the European Commission. This commission, to which Vitruk is 
Russia's permanent representative, had carried out an 
examination of the draft Russian basic law. When speaking to 
the president, Vitruk commented, specifically, on the proposed 
report's provisions illustrating the role played by the 
Constitutional Court in implementing the principles of 
constitutionalism, separation of powers, federalism, protection 
of human rights and liberties. 
  The president and the Constitutional Court acting chief also 
dwelt upon a draft law "On the Constitutional Court of the 
Russian Federation" worked out by constitutional judges and 
submitted to the State Duma as a legislative initiative. Vitruk 
informed Yeltsin about preliminary consultations on the draft 
law with Russia's Supreme Court, the Supreme Arbitration Court, 
the prosecutor general, judges of various constitutional courts, 
Russian and foreign scholars and lawyers. He stressed that at 
the moment, the Constitutional Court was thoroughly examining 
responses to the bill provided by the presidential staff's state 
and legal directorate and by the Duma committee for legislation 
and court reform. The scientific and consultative council under 
the Constitutional Court is to gather in an enlarged meeting to 
discuss the draft law "On the Constitutional Court of the 
Russian Federation". 
  In his turn, Yeltsin assured Vitruk that the Russian 
Constitutional Court and other federal courts would be guarded 
properly. He pledged the presidential decree of October 7, 
1993, on the Constitutional Court in the part of setting up a 
department for security of supreme judicial bodies would be 
fulfilled in full. The security service will be supervised by 
the federal counterintelligence service, a Constitutional Court 
spokesman told TASS.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Military Lawyers To Handle </F>
Zhirinovskiy Case"] 
  [Text] The criminal proceedings instituted against LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy for spreading war propaganda have been handed over 
by the Russian General Prosecutor's Office to the Main Military 
Prosecutor's Office for investigation. 
  We called Valentin Panichev, chief of the Russian Federation 
General Prosecutor's Office Main Administration for the 
Supervision and Implementation of Laws in the Armed Forces, and 
asked him to comment on this fact. But the chief military 
prosecutor declined to give a straight answer to the question of 
why the Zhirinovskiy case has been handed over to military 
lawyers. He said that it had been a decision by the general 
prosecutor, who is entitled to task any law-enforcement organ 
with investigating a particular case. 
  Meanwhile independent experts believe that the Zhirinovskiy 
case has been handed over to the Main Military Prosecutor's 
Office for several reasons. One of these is the fact that the 
Ministry of Security is currently being reorganized and, 
although this is their job, nobody can currently be spared to 
deal with Mr. Zhirinovskiy. Others believe that the 
investigation has been handed over to the military because the 
most skilled specialists currently available are working in the 
Main Military Prosecutor's Office. Nor can we rule out the 
explanation that the LDPR leader was a KGB officer before he 
embarked on political activity; thus he basically remains a KGB 
officer, even though now transferred to the reserves, and his 
problems have to be dealt with by investigators from the 
Military Prosecutor's Office. 
  Whichever version is correct, it is clear that the case 
against the State Duma deputy and leader of one of the biggest 
Duma factions was instituted 26 January in connection with the 
publication of his book "Last Dash to the South," which, in the 
lawyers' opinion, contains elements of war propaganda. Article 
71 of the RSFSR Criminal Code places propaganda of this sort in 
the category of particularly dangerous state crimes and 
stipulates punishment in the form of a three- to eight-year jail 
term. 
  The editorial office has learned that investigators from the 
Main Military Prosecutor's Office have concluded their study of 
the text of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's literary work and have proceeded 
to the stage of gathering the necessary documentation and 
interrogating witnesses. The LDPR leader himself has not yet 
been summoned to the Main Military Prosecutor's Office on 
Kholzunovskiy Pereulok.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin article under "Our Commentary" rubric: </F>
"Local Authorities Trying on Red Pants"] 
  [Text] Russians will have to vote again in March and April 
-- this time for deputies to the local self-government bodies. 
  None of the past election campaigns has had such a tenuous 
legal basis as the present one. There is no federation-wide law 
on the elections -- the State Duma is only just setting about 
producing one. On the other hand the president's Edict No. 1765 
gave administration heads themselves the right to ratify local 
election statutes. You do not have to be a clairvoyant to 
predict that they will give free rein to their whims. 
  This is just what they are doing. 
  The administration in Voronezh has reserved the right to 
hold 
meetings of voters -- or not, as they please -- to nominate 
candidates for deputies, and to admit observers or not. The 
Tula administration head may himself appoint a section of the 
deputies to the representative body. The mayor of St. 
Petersburg has refused students and servicemen the right to vote 
while at the same time forbidding Federation Council members to 
stand as deputies. The Leningrad Oblast administration head will 
himself appoint municipal leaders (who should, of course, be 
elected by the people). 
  So the executive branch offensive against representative 
branch prerogatives is continuing. But there is nothing to be 
surprised about here -- this is what step-by-step constitutional 
reform amounts to. It is more to the point to ask the question: 
What will become of the country if this impromptu approach 
extends to the whole of great Russia? 
  As far as the range of views represented on the eve of the 
elections is concerned, it does differ, though not sharply, from 
that of December. All seven communist parties are vigorously 
nominating their own candidates this time (only Zyuganov's 
Communist Party participated in the federal elections), as are 
the parties with a popular-patriotic orientation. The regional 
organizations of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] 
are hedging their bets. Zhirinovskiy has stated that these 
elections have not the slightest significance for him -- all his 
thoughts are on the presidential election. But in the provinces 
the LDPR branches are not inactive and are counting on winning a 
majority of the votes cast -- which, to tell the truth, is 
hardly likely if you take into consideration the stiff 
competition put up by the left-wing and patriotic movements. 
The democratic forces, on the other hand, finally seem 
reconciled to the prospect of losing. Presidential Territorial 
Administration Chief Nikolay Medvedev even stated that a Red 
anti-presidential cordon could form around Moscow, taking in 
Lipetsk, Kursk, Orel, Voronezh, Ryazan, Mordovia, and Penza. 
Almost as in 1918: Then, if you remember, the government, 
ringed by the Whites, was forced to transfer from St. Petersburg 
to the Kremlin in Moscow. 
  You can only say one thing definitely: Whatever the results 
of the elections they will hardly provide a solid basis on which 
to extricate ourselves from the crisis. The converse is more 
likely: Yet one more leg of the presidential chair will fold 
under him. But a poor result is nevertheless a result. The time 
is coming when to dramatize the outcome of the voting, to ring 
all the bells and cry "Russia, you've gone crazy" would be 
tantamount to summoning the spirits of revolution. Enough of 
that! It would be nice to enter the 21st century in a well-cut 
rule of law suit. Let presidential power be the pants and 
parliamentary power the jacket. Or the other way around, so 
long as there are no pistol muzzles jutting from the pockets. 
The pockets should contain only handkerchiefs, and these should 
be sweetly scented.

<F P=106> [Veronika Kutsyllo report: "President's Edict on </F>
Information Technology. FAGCSI-zation of All Powers Over"] 
  [Text] The war waged for many months by the Federal Agency 
of Government Communications Services and Information under the 
Russian Federation president (FAGCSI) to be the sole master of 
the information systems catering to the top bodies of power has 
been crowned with success. Under Boris Yeltsin's edict signed 
Monday evening, the only structure opposing the FAGCSI -- the 
Administration for Information Resources of the presidential 
staff (AIR) -- has been abolished and its functions handed over 
to FAGCSI. 
  The war between FAGCSI and AIR -- the last "electronic 
subunit in the system of the supreme organs of power that worked 
with unclassified information -- had been waged for more than a 
year. Its methods were fully in line with the agency's 
background -- the former directorate for government 
communication service of the KGB. Back in summer 1993, a memo 
prepared by the Security Ministry, the Communications Ministry, 
and the FAGCSI was put on the president's desk. Viktor 
Barannikov, Vasiliy Bulgak, and Aleksandr Starovoytov hinted at 
certain "state-run and commercial organizations" that enlisted 
the services of foreign firms to create information networks 
which, in the authors' view, enabled Western special services 
"to introduce into the Russian market systems of processing, 
storage, and transmission of information enabling these services 
to monitor information." 
  The unnamed organizations implied that AIR and its chief, 
Vasiliy Kupriyanovskiy, was trying to set up a system, 
independent from FAGCSI, of information telecommunications which 
contravened the plan for the creation of "a single information 
space" in Russia elaborated in the former KGB Directorate for 
Government Communications Service. On the basis of FAGCSI, 
naturally. Starovoytov, however, needed another six months for 
finally "eating up" the last unclassified information structure. 
No proof of Kupriyanovskiy's "pro-spy" activities could be 
procured and he was fired the day AIR was abolished "for 
repeated gross violations of office discipline" -- taking a trip 
to Italy without Sergey Filatov's authorization (but with the 
authorizations of Filatov's deputies). 
  The outcome of the standoff certified by the president's 
edict makes it possible for FAGCSI, led by a former KGB general, 
not only autocratically "to protect" all information circulating 
in the top organs of power, but also, and naturally enough, to 
monitor it in the same autocratic manner.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 23 February broadcasts its regular 
10-minute "Details" program, introduced by Sergey Dorenko, which 
deals with the case of scientist Vil Mirzayanov who is accused 
of divulging state secrets connected with the development of new 
chemical weapons. 
  Vil Mirzayanov, who was detained on 27 January, was released 
yesterday on condition that he would not leave Moscow while his 
case was being reexamined. He is shown at home with his wife 
and two children. He says the conditions in the prison were 
unbearable and told a story when a fellow prisoner was severely 
beaten up by a warden. 
  In the past Mirzayanov headed a technical 
counterintelligence 
department at a Scientific Research Institute in Moscow. 
  Mirzayanov cannot explain why his colleagues in the West 
keep 
silent. He expresses the hope that scientists working on 
similar weapons for NATO will rebel against the system. He 
says: "Although my colleagues told me that there was a 
breakthrough in the field of developing new types of chemical 
weapons in the United States too, but, you see, this is nothing 
more than a guess. Of course, most likely, scientific research, 
whether we receive information about it or not, usually goes in 
parallel. I will not rule out that the United States has also 
developed similar substances." 
  According to Sergey Dorenko, Lev Fedorov, Mirzayanov's 
colleague and doctor of chemical sciences, says that Russia has 
already developed a chemical agent formula that was not included 
in the conventions prohibiting tests of chemical weapons and 
therefore, was not subject to elimination. No international 
organization can check whether that was true. In Fedorov's 
words, even Yeltsin "will never be able to check the fact that 
there are binary chemical weapons that are ready for use in 
combat operations."

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Tsarev: "State Secrets for the Masses!"] </F>
  [Text] The case of chemist Mirzayanov accused of divulging 
state secrets concerning the development of chemical weapons is 
taking a new turn. In particular Valeriya Novodvorskaya has 
issued the following statement to the POSTFACTUM agency: 
"Inasmuch as the Russian president has found the time to 
express his distress over the tribulations of our hockey team at 
the Olympics and even telephoned personally to Norway while 
being unable to find either the time or the inclination to give 
an opinion on Vil Mirzayanov's imprisonment, on 21 February I 
sent two Western powers three secret studies of a strategic 
nature. That is I have done something which comes under Article 
65 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code -- "espionage." 
  In addition V. Novodvorskaya said that unless Vil Mirzayanov 
is released by 10 March she will hand over the formula for a 
Russian binary weapon (over which all the trouble started) to a 
European Community state. Let us note that the chemist V. Uglev 
also intended to make this secret public. 
  Russian General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik yesterday 
repealed the preventive restriction measure chosen by the course 
for detaining Vil Mirzayanov. Now he must be released 
immediately on the undertaking that he does not change his 
address.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] In a memorandum they submitted to President Boris 
Yeltsin the personnel of the analytical center of the 
socioeconomic department in his headquarters suggest ways to 
overcome the payment crisis which, they believe, can lead to a 
nation-wide social upheaval. 
  The document lists the causes of the crisis: 
  1. The government promised to much to pay and so had to 
print more money, which is likely to trigger hyperinflation. 
  2. Factories transfer their own funds and credits into 
deposits, foundation capital of joint stock societies and hard 
currency reserves rather than use them to pay debts. 
  3. Factory managers cannot be made answerable for failure to 
pay debts to their suppliers or to the taxation service. 
  4. The mechanism of putting businesses in order and 
liquidating them under the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act is not 
working. 
  5. There is no supervision of the transfer and use of 
centralized credits. 
  6. The production continues to decline against a background 
of high inflation. 
  The analysts suggest that the head of state should: 
  -- Set up regional commissions which would urgently check 
the 
financial health of debtor businesses. Local administration, 
banks, taxation office and law enforcement agency officials must 
be members of the commissions. The commissions would identify 
debts which are attributable to failure on the part of the state 
to honor its commitments to the factories; identify factories 
which have hard currency accounts in the deposits in commercial 
banks, notably abroad and still are not non-payers; determine 
the export hard currency revenues of factories that failed to 
reach Russia; identify hopeless debtors and enter them in a 
special register to be handed over to the State Property 
Commission. 
  -- Approach different kinds of factories in different ways. 
The experts think that the state should pay its debts to the 
coal mining and defense industries and to the farmers shortly. 
Credits should be given to enable power stations stay in 
business until the spring starts; after power stations should 
discontinue supply of debtor factories. Managers of other 
enterprises, notably of the gas and oil mining the president 
should be made additionally responsible if the commission finds 
that they failed to pay their suppliers by used the funds to 
deposit them in banks, to buy shares of joint stock societies or 
to buy equipment or if they have funds on hard currency accounts 
but do not exchange them for rubles to pay their suppliers. 
Factories must be compelled to pay their overdue debts from 
their hard currency accounts. 
  -- Order the government to rule that every legal entity must 
have a maximum of three ruble and two hard currency accounts. 
The entity should submit data on all the accounts to the 
taxation inspection. Those who fail to do so must be forced to 
pay considerable sums. This ruling should be made consistent 
with criminal responsibility for tax evasion. In this way funds 
would be discovered that could be used for timely payment of 
debts to suppliers and tax evasion would be prevented. 
  -- Order the government to introduce a procedure of mutual 
payment of debts by using LC-contracts that are used 
internationally. The essence of this procedure is that when a 
contract on supply of products is signed, the bank freezes the 
sum of the future payment in the payer's account. Once the 
product has been shipped, the bank transfers the sum to the 
supplier. In this way the customer cannot avoid payment of 
debts under the pretext of having no funds on his accounts and 
unreliable suppliers cannot cheat the consumers. 
  -- Order the Central Bank to credit chiefly the final 
consumers so as to breath life into the chain of production 
financing and product sales. 
  -- Tighten controls over use of appropriated budget funds 
and 
centralized credits so that they are used chiefly to pay debts. 
  -- Impose stringent sanctions for delaying the payment 
documents going as far as withdrawing licenses from commercial 
banks and levying administrative punishment on cashier center 
managers. 
  -- Regard organizing circulation of promissory note a 
priority task. Make additional organizational and material 
resources available to the State Property Committee for this 
purpose. 
  -- Sell some of the debts incurred by factories to 
commercial banks, state financial institutions and foreign 
customers. Exchange the debts in some cases for long term 
liabilities of the state or state bonds at rates that vary with 
the status of the factory and chances of recovering the debt 
(the lower the chance, the lower the rate). 
  -- Following in the footsteps of Western Europe, attract 
private firms for cyclic offsetting of claims (using the system 
of clearings). 
  -- Hold an inter-agency conference of the State Property 
Committee, the Supreme Court of Arbitration, the Economy 
Ministry and the Finance Ministry with a view to working out a 
program of specific steps designed to make the Insolvency 
(Bankruptcy) Act work. No financial discipline is thinkable 
without bankruptcies.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report under the "Leaders" rubric: </F>
"Professor Yasin Has Suggested Chernomyrdin Become Marshal 
Zhukov in Order `To Create Reserves for a Decisive Offensive'"] 
  [Text] Announcing an address by Professor Yevgeniy Yasin 
at yesterday's meeting of the "Leaders Club," an elite public 
organization comprising chiefs of industrial enterprises and 
commercial businesses, the chairman -- Arkadiy Volskiy, chief of 
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs -- said 
that Yasin would soon assume a senior office at the presidential 
staff and reminded the audience of the president's message to 
the State Duma, which should dot the i's in the lengthy 
discussion on the government's new economic deal. Volskiy's 
preliminary remarks have thus added weight to the professor's 
private assessments. 
  Yevgeniy Yasin pointed to two extreme views of the two-year 
experience of economic reform. The first, set forth in the 
well-known report drawn up by academicians, is that Gaydar's 
policy was a failure. The second, monetarist one, is that there 
is a natural process under way, but the government lacks 
sufficient stick-to-itiveness in pursuing a tight monetary 
policy; that the state should learn to live within its means 
without covering budget gaps by creating extra money. 
  In Yasin's view, there has been no failure of the reform 
policy. The critics, Yasin said, do however fail to see 
important achievements, such as the stabilization of the ruble, 
which was achieved without any administrative intervention, the 
Central Bank's positive refinancing rate, and the partial 
redressing of price imbalances as a result of price 
liberalization. The crisis cannot be overcome only by skills in 
tinkering with macroeconomic indicators, he continued. The main 
problem of 1994 is the reduction in inflation rates. "The 
struggle against inflation is a necessary measure for any 
responsible government," Yevgeniy Yasin said. Attempts to manage 
the inflationary process with a monthly inflation rate standing 
at 20 percent will be doomed to failure. 
  Among priority measures to adjust economic reform Yasin 
mentioned the tightening of taxation discipline and the 
government's efforts to boost private investment in the 
production sector. 
  "We need to carry our a strategic maneuver, something Zhukov 
did in the battle of Moscow -- not to squander money to patch up 
holes, but to create reserves for a decisive offensive," was how 
Yasin summed up his address. When asked by a director whom he 
sees as suited for the role of Zhukov, he said without 
hesitation: "Viktor Chernomyrdin is quite capable of lifting 
the economy out of the crisis."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 23 Feb -- Below follows the text of the 
speech made by Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian 
Federation, at the Suvorov military school in Moscow on 23 
February where he addressed students of the Suvorov and Nakhimov 
military schools. 
  Dear Suvorov and Nakhimov students, dear cadets! Dear 
veterans, servicemen of the Russian Army and teachers! Dear 
friends! 
  You have chosen for your profession serving Russia, 
protecting Russia's people and its peaceful life. Please accept 
my warm congratulations on the Day of Defenders of the 
Motherland. From all my heart I wish you good health and 
happiness, as well as success in your noble career. 
  The military profession, the profession which defends the 
motherland has been respected and honored in Russia since 
ancient times. It has been the destiny of the Russian people to 
have to fight for its freedom and independence for centuries. 
  The valiant defenders of our native soil were always the 
first to rise up in the path of the foe. Their heroic battle 
deeds have forever become part of Russian history and have left 
a deep imprint on the whole of our culture. Many events of 
epoch-making importance for Russia resound with their glory. 
  Today we pay a tribute of respect to our veterans and to 
everyone who with their blood and by their heroism and 
incredible exertions gained victory and earned peace and our 
enormous gratitude. 
  The other day we marked the fifth anniversary of the 
withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan. That war remains 
forever in our history, which, however much one might try, 
cannot be rewritten afresh. In one way or another that war 
affected each of our hearts, and the pain still remains painful 
and the bitterness still remains bitter. 
  One should cast no doubts upon the true valor and heroism, 
and loyalty to the military oath and to their homeland which our 
soldiers and officers displayed during that undeclared war. 
  The state is indebted to these people. And we will do 
everything possible for the social protection of the Afghantsi, 
the families of the deceased, those who are missing, and the 
disabled. 
  There is no purpose in speaking about the past, about the 
great victories and accomplishments, about defeats and setbacks, 
without a firm belief in the future. 
  In its most difficult periods three things have helped 
Russia 
to stand the tests and to take heart in its great, 
indestructible foundations: spiritual might and the creative 
genius of the people, immense natural resources and the valor of 
its defenders. 
  Our generation has enormous responsibility to treat with 
care 
the legacy we have inherited and, no matter how difficult it 
might be, to multiply it and to pass the baton with dignity to 
future generations. 
  The defenders of Russia always had only one goal -- to 
protect the country and to establish the people's sacred rights 
without which a peace and stable development of civic life is 
not possible. 
  Soon, you, who bear the honorable name of Suvorov and 
Nakhimov cadets, will have to fulfill the honorary goal. 
  You are successors to the best combat traditions in the 
Russian army and fleet. You, future officers, are to carry and 
multiply the glory of Russian armor. 
  Aleksandr Vasilyevich Suvorov used to say that a good name 
of 
a man lies in the glory and well-being of his Fatherland. 
  May those voluminous words -- duty, honor and the Fatherland 
-- be your motto in life. Such is the sacred precept of many 
generations of defenders of the Russian state. So long as this 
behest is alive, so will the state remain, so will the people 
live. 
  Profound changes are taking place today in the army and 
throughout the country. It would be simply impossible 
otherwise. Our army has not been renewed throughout two decades. 
It hardly needs saying what this means to the state's defense 
capability, and to you, the people of the military. 
  That is why the country's armed forces have been given the 
task to step up the military reforms. They began in 1992, but, 
clearly, what has been done so far is insufficient. There is 
now an opportunity to act more resolutely and consistently. 
  The new Russian Constitution has been adopted. The legal 
basis of the work of the armed forces has been sealed in the 
recently adopted military doctrine. 
  I would like to stress that this doctrine is of a defensive 
nature. In other words, Russia does not wittingly treat any one 
state as its enemy. 
  Of course, the main points of the doctrine are not dogma. 
They will be amplified as the situation unfolds. But the 
country has designated clear objectives in the sphere of 
security and the means to achieve them. And the armed forces 
have received clear guidelines for their development. They are, 
as follows: 
  -- flexible organization; 
  -- compactness; 
  -- mobility; 
  -- being equipped with the latest technology and weaponry; 
  -- being staffed with highly professional personnel. 
  Of course, it will take time and a lot of effort to achieve 
these guidelines. It is even more so since the country received 
an extremely deranged military legacy. 
  Russia bears on its shoulders the heavy burden of providing 
accommodation and amenities for the formations and units that 
are being withdrawn from abroad. There are problems with 
financing the troops' vital activities and their supplies. The 
social protection of servicemen, the providing of accommodation 
for them, etc. are becoming very acute issues. 
  More important is the role of a meticulous and lucid Russian 
defense policy. 
  As one knows, with the withdrawal of troops from East 
European countries, the first defense echelon of the former 
Soviet Union has disappeared. The troops of the second echelon 
have now come under the jurisdiction of Ukraine and Belarus. 
Their withdrawal from the Baltics is under way. 
  As a result, the Moscow, Leningrad and North Caucasian 
military districts, which were previously internal ones, have 
now become border military districts. The Urals and Volga 
military districts are becoming a base for the preparation of 
mobilization resources and the basis for the creation of a new 
operational strategic formation. 
  To all intents and purposes, the groupings of conventional 
armed forces in the territory of the Russian Federation will 
have been created afresh before 1995. The overall number of 
groupings and formations is to be sharply reduced. At the same 
time they will be provided with the most up-to-date and 
efficient armaments and military equipment. The military will 
have reliable weapons in their possession. 
  The groupings being created will be capable of rebuffing 
aggression in local and regional wars and military conflicts. 
  If a large-scale war is unleashed, they will ensure the 
strategic deployment of the armed forces. 
  In line with this, a whole defense infrastructure on Russian 
territory will be essentially changed (and to a considerable 
degree created anew). 
  It is particularly important to resolutely renounce the 
residual principle with regard to the officers' corps and all 
the personnel which has already become a tradition. 
  The armed forces are experiencing a chronic lack of 
attention 
from the state and the entire society to its needs. This is an 
unwholesome practice. It demoralizes people and makes them 
doubt the importance of their military service to the state. 
  Therefore, the vital goals of the reform's present stage 
include the following: 
  -- creating and consolidating legally a system of social 
guarantees for the servicemen, members of their families, 
servicemen transferred to the reserve and retired military 
(including those who took early retirement); 
  -- switching over to a combined system of enlistment for the 
Army and Navy; 
  -- introducing alternative forms of service. 
  One of the priority tasks for the coming year is to create 
mobile forces, capable of rapid deployment, redeployment, and 
carrying out combat operations in any areas and regions where a 
threat to Russia's military security may arise. 
  It was necessary to transfer the battalion to the area of 
Sarajevo, and in accordance with the Minister's order, after 
negotiating six passes in 24 hours, it was at the appointed spot 
and carried out a crucial task which the whole of the world is 
applauding. 
  Today many of our soldiers have to serve outside Russia -- 
in 
the border states and in Yugoslavia, where the flames are raging 
of an interethnic, fratricidal war. The mission of these 
Russian sub-units is a noble and peacekeeping one: to stop the 
bloodshed and restore peace and stability in these regions. 
They are serving Russia, and its security is being guarded on 
its distant approaches. There our soldiers are having a more 
difficult time of it than inside Russia where no fires of 
interethnic conflict are blazing. 
  Speaking of which, I cannot help mentioning the event which 
in the past few days became especially important for the world 
community. I mean the Bosnian crisis. 
  It has tested the strength of our course by demonstrating to 
the world the true potential of the Russian foreign policy. 
First of all, our ability to firmly defend the national and 
state interests of the country. 
  Russia, as member of the UN Security Council and an equal 
member of the democratic world community, demonstrated its right 
to participate in adoption of the key world policy decisions, 
especially, if these involve its legitimate interests and 
international obligations. 
  And the world listened to our voice. The mechanism of 
partnership with the West has been tested. It did work, albeit 
not immediately, and with some interruptions. The fundamental 
principle of the Russian foreign policy -- dialogue and 
cooperation with the leading states -- has proved right. 
  The Sarajevo crisis also revealed that our course aimed at 
the strengthening of the United Nations in every possible way as 
the principal international organization for maintaining peace 
was right. 
  The result of these efforts is a cease-fire in Sarajevo 
without a new escalation of the military conflict in Bosnia. 
  The events around Sarajevo is a call for common sense to all 
those involved in the conflict. The logic of peace should, at 
long last, gain victory over nationalist emotions which have led 
the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the limit of human 
suffering. 
  I hope all the parties in the conflict will fulfill their 
obligations to the United Nations, ensure a reliable cease-fire 
and not allow provocations against the international peacemaking 
forces, inter alia against the Russian contingent currently 
deployed in the Sarajevo. 
  We shall increase the peaceful attack in close cooperation 
with the United Nation and our partners. The aim is to make the 
cease-fire in Sarajevo a turning point to peace in the whole 
Bosnia. 
  The power of the army is in its high moral spirit which is 
based on the continuous ties with the society, the strict 
discipline, and the subordination to the law, the high battle 
training, and the psychological readiness. 
  This is a well-known fact to the elderly people, our 
veterans, who all their lives served their country and their 
people faithfully and truly. 
  Let us bow low to them for this. The new generation of 
defenders of the homeland has an example to follow. 
  You, the young servicemen, are the hope of the Russian Army 
and Navy. Be worthy of your forebears' glory, study well, 
prepare yourselves morally and physically to defend our 
Motherland. You have good conditions for all this, though I 
agree that you need some help now and then -- all the more so 
that your school will soon celebrate its 50th anniversary. 
  I congratulate everyone present on today's holiday -- the 
Day 
of Defenders of the Motherland. I wish good health, happiness 
and success to all of you, your teachers and your families!

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
said on Wednesday that Russia wants to minimise the number of 
its troops which are acting as peace-keepers in war-hit regions. 
  "We are worried for our guys and adopt all political and 
diplomatic measures so that there are as few Russian troops 
abroad as possible", Yeltsin said during a meeting with Moscow 
teenagers studying in military schools. 
  The Russian Army would become in the coming years a "mobile, 
well-organised (force), equipped with latest weapons and 
armaments and with highly professional personnel", according to 
the president. 
  Yeltsin called to accelerate the reform in the Armed Forces 
which he said is going not actively enough. 
  He said that the structure of the Armed Forces would be 
considerably changed. The number of major units and formations 
will be reduced, while the remaining ones will be reinforced 
with personnel and modern weapons and hardware. 
  "Only in this case they (units) will be able to localise any 
conflicts", the president said.

  [Text] Moscow 23 Feb--Russian President Boris Yeltsin has 
sent greetings to the personnel and veterans of the Armed Forces 
of the Russian Federation on the occasion of the Day of 
Defenders of the Fatherland, which is marked on 23 February. 
  The president's press service has circulated the text of the 
greetings, which say: 
  To the personnel and veterans of the Armed Forces of the 
Russian Federation: With all my heart, I congratulate 
servicemen and members of their families, veterans of war and 
the Armed Forces, and the civilian staff of the Army and Navy on 
the Day of Defenders of the Fatherland. 
  The Day of Defenders of the Fatherland holds a special place 
in the calendar of festivals. All the people celebrate it, 
paying a tribute of respect and gratitude to Russian servicemen. 
  It is they who were the first to stand up against those who 
tried to destroy our state with fire and sword and to enslave 
our people. During the most difficult, mortally dangerous 
moments of the war, they bore the salvation of Russia without 
sparing their lives. 
  Today it is you, servicemen of the Army and Navy, who are 
the 
worthy heirs and successors of martial traditions. Under 
difficult conditions, you are displaying steadfastness and 
endurance and are honorably carrying out your professional and 
civic duty. 
  Like the whole of the country, the Armed Forces are 
currently 
going through a period of deep transformation. The Army is one 
of the main foundations of Russian statehood, the guarantor of 
peace, the guarantor of stability in the country and of the 
people's democratic gains. It is for this reason that it must 
be mighty and mobile, equipped with the most effective weapons 
systems. The state will do everything so that servicemen and 
members of their families will feel protected in social terms, 
in order that the prestige of the military profession is 
enhanced. 
  I have no doubt that the personnel of the Russian Armed 
Forces will continue to be faithful to the Constitution, to 
their oath and duty, and will cherish the military vocation and 
military comradeship. 
  I wish you, dear servicemen, your families and friends, 
veterans and civilian staff of the Army and Navy, robust health, 
happiness and prosperity. Honor, glory, and immense gratitude 
to you for your difficult military labor. I wish you success in 
your service and lives! 
  [Signed] B. Yeltsin

  [Text] Army reform "is going tough, lagging behind the 
plans we drew up, but it is still going," Russia's Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev told Interfax on Wednesday. Yet, he 
stressed that "over almost two years Russia had managed to 
create a strong army," although, by his admittance, not the army 
he dreams about. 
  At this complex time for the Russian army, Grachev remarked, 
about 16,000 Russian servicemen are on peaceful duties in 
Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan and other countries in CIS and 
elsewhere. 
  He recalled that several days ago Russian troops 
demonstrated 
their power in former Yugoslavia, where they marched along bad 
roads in heavy snow and after covering 500 kilometers ahead of 
time reached Bosnia's capital Sarajevo. 
  "I have met with foreigners in CIS and other countries, and 
I 
can say that they are sympathetic toward our army," the 
minister said. 
  The Army and Navy Day, observed on February 23, is a holiday 
not only for servicemen but for the entire people, Grachev 
stressed. "Those who slander the army are simply ignorant people 
or those who hate not only the army but our Russia," the defence 
minister declared.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told a 
meeting of veterans and servicemen in Moscow Wednesday [23 
February] that none of the former Soviet republics had a proper 
army. He attributed this to shortage of skilled men and absence 
of command structures or deployment systems. This is the reason 
why Russia has undertaken to send troops on peacekeeping 
missions to `hot spots' in the former USSR. "There are numerous 
Russians residing in conflict areas and we must protect their 
interests," the minister said. 
  He said that the reform of the Russian armed forces had run 
into problems in terms of the financing and construction of 
homes for servicemen. He hoped nevertheless, that the compact 
and mobile forces that are required by the new military doctrine 
would be set up.

<F P=106> ["Order No. 49 of the Russian Minister of Defense," signed </F>
by Army General P. Grachev, Russian Federation minister of 
defense, dated Moscow, 21 February 1994] 
  [Text] Comrade soldiers and seamen, sergeants and 
noncommissioned officers, warrant officers, petty officers, and 
other officers! 
  Comrade war, labor, and Armed Forces veterans! 
  On 23 February 1994 the Russian Federation celebrates a 
remarkable day -- Defenders of the Fatherland Day. 
  Throughout history the Army and Navy have served the people 
and the Fatherland, and they continue to serve them today. Many 
events in Russia's history are adorned by the valor and glory of 
the Armed Forces. The feats of the soldiers of the Great 
Patriotic War, who liberated many countries from fascism and 
militarism, will remain in the people's memory for centuries. 
Their selfless devotion to the Motherland, their ardent 
patriotism, military skill, and loyalty to their duty and oaths 
of allegiance are an unfading example for servicemen of the 
Russian Armed Forces on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the 
Great Victory. 
  The consolidation of unity, esprit de corps, and military 
comradeship in military collectives and the people's respect for 
the honor and dignity of the defenders of the Fatherland are 
today an important factor in the internal stability of society, 
a pledge of the successful performance by Army and Navy 
servicemen of tasks aimed at safeguarding the defense and 
security of the country. War, labor, and Armed Forces veterans 
make a significant contribution to strengthening the 
motherland's defense capability and to young people's patriotic 
education. 
  I salute and congratulate you on Defenders of the Fatherland 
Day, dear comrades. 
  I wish Army and Navy personnel every success in 
consolidating 
the Motherland's defense capability, increasing combat readiness 
and the quality of professional training, and strengthening 
organization and military discipline. 
  I wish war, labor, and Armed Forces veterans good health and 
happiness, and success in raising the rising generation in the 
traditions of loyal service to the people and for the good of 
Russia. 
  To commemorate Defenders of the Fatherland Day I order: 
  That festive firework displays take place 23 February 1994 
at 
2100 hours local time in the hero-city of Moscow, capital of our 
motherland, and in the hero-cities of St. Petersburg, Volgograd, 
Novorossiysk, Tula, Smolensk, and Murmansk, and also in the 
cities of Kaliningrad, Rostov-na-Donu, Samara, Yekaterinburg, 
Novosibirsk, Chita, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and Severomorsk. 
  [Signed] Army General P. Grachev, Russian Federation 
minister 
of defense

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS--The Russian Navy denied 
reports that a nuclear submarine from the Kamchatka flotilla of 
the Pacific Fleet had been netted by a Russian seiner 10 miles 
off the coast of the peninsula on Sunday. 
  "Submarines of the Pacific Fleet have nothing to do with the 
incident near the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula", the press 
service of the Russian Navy told TASS on Thursday. 
  According to the military, only one nuclear submarine of the 
Kamchatka flotilla was at sea during the time. After its return 
to the base representatives of the company which owes the 
fishing vessel checked the U-boat and did not find either the 
net or any traces of damage. Besides, a detailed investigation 
which also studied the submarine's register and other documents 
confirmed that the U-boat was not involved in the incident. 
  The Kamchatka-based VESTI newspaper reported on Wednesday 
that the Russian "Kamsudo-3" seiner had netted a nuclear 
submarine which safely escaped together with the net worth 20 
million roubles. 
  The ship mistook the submarine for a big shoal of fish. The 
submarine turned out to be right under the fishing vessel and 
had it surfaced there would have been a shipwreck. 
  Astonished fishermen watched the surfaced conning tower of 
the U-boat pass along their vessel and disappear together with 
the net, the newspaper said. 
  It added that this was the second incident of the type. The 
first one was registered in 1976. 
  Now it remains to clear up who the submarine belonged to.

<F P=106> [By V. Lavrushenko, including recorded remarks by A. Zhokin, </F>
deputy chief of GosAtomNadzor; from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Lavrushenko] The production of nuclear weapons 
still remains a very well-kept secret--not only for the 
uninformed population, but also for the federal radiation safety 
control bodies. The All-Russia Conference of GosAtomNadzor 
[State Committee for Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety] that was held in Novosibirsk stated this fact with 
alarm. Now the regions that produce nuclear weapons have the 
added problem of storing radioactive materials that have been 
taken out of service. It is proposed to set up one of the 
storage depots in Tomsk-7. 
  [Zhokin] It must, naturally, be stored in a dismantled 
state, 
and it must further be regenerated and processed once again in 
the place where it was produced. There are no other places; 
they do not exist. 
  [Lavrushenko] This is regarded as an unconvincing argument 
by 
the population of areas where bombs have been assembled for many 
years without the population's knowledge, and where--on the 
basis of this argument--unexploded bombs will now be stored 
again for many generations, even though the military and the 
Ministry of Atomic Energy are trying to win the Tomsk and 
Siberian residents' agreement by offering large sums of money. 
  The explosion in Tomsk-7 last year was a much more 
convincing 
argument.

  [Summary] Slavyanka is to run a regular feature on the 
fourth Wednesday of each month entitled "The Russian Arsenal" 
devoted to Russian advanced weaponry. 
  The Su-34 front-line bomber is to replace the Su-24 and 
Su-24M. It has a range of 4,000 km. Its on-board computer and 
other radio-electronic equipment with multiple back-ups can 
bring the aircraft to its destination in any weather conditions 
with a precision of one meter. Its homing missiles and bombs 
can be launched from a range of up to 250 km. The two-man crew 
sit alongside each other in a comfortable air-conditioned 
cockpit. It has an artificial intelligence, an active safety 
system which allows acrobatic maneuvers at a speed of 1,400 
km/hr and at very low altitudes. It can overcome air defense 
systems. The cockpit has 17-mm armor to defend the airmen from 
stray bullets. 
  Many of the aircraft's other features are still classified.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report under the "Reform" rubric: "Council </F>
of Ministers Meeting Postponed Over Premier's Flu. Ivan Rybkin 
Wants To Set Up Government"] 
  [Text] It became known yesterday that the Council of 
Ministers' enlarged session was postponed from Friday 
tentatively to Thursday, 3 March, due to the premier's illness. 
  On 21 February, Viktor Chernomyrdin was diagnosed as having 
flu with acute inflammation of upper respiratory tracts. Flu of 
this variety is usually over in a week's time; at worst, it can 
take one and a half or two weeks. Chronic pneumonia is among 
possible complications. 
  Apparently not yet aware of Chernomyrdin's serious ailment, 
Ivan Rybkin, opening the Duma plenary session on Wednesday, put 
forward the idea for a national accord government (this is the 
second "encroachment" [nayezd] at Chernomyrdin on the part of 
those willing to form a government -- the first one came from 
Yavlinskiy). 
  Speaking before the discussion on a package of decrees on 
amnesty and the memorandum "On Accord in Society," Ivan Rybkin 
declared: "We are condemned to agreement in order to pull out of 
the all-pervading crisis.... Young energetic economists have 
elaborated a program for bringing Russia's economy out of 
crisis, and it could become a basis for forming a government of 
national accord. That government could have a firm majority in 
the Duma, which would, in the final analysis, lead to the 
stability of executive power." 
  In the given case the "young and energetic economists," the 
guiding lights [vershiteli] of the report "The Guidelines for 
the Forming of Economic Policy," are understood to be Sergey 
Glazyev (Economic Policy Committee head); Yuriy Petrov, 
laboratory head of the Central Economic-Mathematical Institute; 
and Aleksandr Ageyev, head of the MAPO [expansion unknown] 
analytical service. This report is also known as "Glazyev's 
report" and "the economic conference report" (the autumn 
conference -- not to be confused with the summer conference 
report).

"The State Duma Needs People Who Know the Army's Problems. In 
the Opinion of the Member of the State Duma and Chairman of the 
Subcommittee on the Activity of the Armed Forces, Other Troops 
and Troop Formations, There Is an Acute Dearth of Professional 
Military Men Among the Deputies"] 
  [Text] In conversation with your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
correspondent, Yuriy Rodionov stressed that a considerable part 
of the questions which are examined by the lower chamber of the 
Federal Assembly require professional knowledge in the sphere of 
defense. This is particularly true of the Defense Committee. 
However, in the deputy's words, the State Duma has a shortage of 
servicemen, that is, of people who know the Army's problems 
other than by hearsay. It will take time for the defense 
committee to become really capable of work. Although, according 
to Yuriy Rodionov, there are "intelligent civilian specialists" 
on the committee who are seriously intent on getting to grips 
with the problems of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. 
  Colonel General Rodionov considers the active involvement of 
servicemen in the campaign for election to the local organs of 
representative power to be essential. "The situation today is 
such," he says, "that servicemen themselves are currently the 
best representatives of their own interests in the organs of 
power. However, it is essential not to make the wrong choice. 
The experience of previous election campaigns shows that some 
candidates based their programs on a conflict with the command 
and were thus less inclined to get involved in legislative 
activity, expending their energy on making political statements 
instead. The experience of service combined with general human 
qualities is the guarantee that our elected representative will 
not forget the interests of his voters. 
  As for the legal basis of the serviceman's period as a 
deputy, Yuriy Rodionov said that a group of deputies have put 
forward a proposal to introduce amendments to the Law on the 
Status of the State Duma Deputy. The amendments envisage the 
secondment of the serviceman deputy for the period of the 
discharge of his duties as deputy. According to the 
parliamentarian's proposal, the relevant statute could specify 
the mechanism for the exercise of that right: the servicemen 
would be excluded from the roster of a unit (establishment or 
enterprise) but would remain on the roster of the Armed Forces, 
in other words they would not be discharged and would retain all 
their legally enshrined benefits. In that event the rights of 
servicemen would not be inferior to those of miners, oil 
workers, and so forth.... At the end of his term as a deputy the 
serviceman would return to his unit.

  [Text] Aleksandr Nazarchuk, head of the Agrarian Committee 
of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, 
said on Wednesday that the draft government resolution "The 
Economic Conditions for the Functioning of the Agroindustrial 
Complex of the Russian Federation in 1994" was signed late on 
Tuesday night. The document caused disagreements at a February 
3 government presidium meeting. 
  Nazarchuk said at a news briefing that Russia's agrarian 
sector had this year received a credit of only 270 Bn rubles at 
213 percent interest. Altogether the sector is to receive under 
the government resolution "five trillion rubles instead of the 
six trillion necessary to carry through the spring sowing and 
end the wintering of the livestock," he said. 
  The agroindustrial complex demanded a credit of 14 to 15 Tn 
rubles for this year, and those were the figures indicated in 
the original version of the resolution, Nazarchuk said. But in 
the version signed on Tuesday all the figures are much lower, he 
said. 
  Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy, chairman of the Agrarian Policy 
Committee of the Federation Council, the upper house of the 
legislature, in this connection expressed skepticism about "the 
hopes of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food to produce 85 Mn 
tonnes of grain this year" (Russia produced 100 Mn tonnes last 
year and 106 Mn tonnes in 1992). He does not expect this year's 
harvest to top 60 or 70 Mn tonnes, "which would last Russia 180 
to 200 days, and then it will be living on doles." 
  Zvolinskiy said Federation Council deputies might propose a 
vote of confidence in the government if it did not change its 
agricultural policy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under "In the State Duma" rubric: </F>
"Parliament Changes Address"] 
  [Text] By fall the State Duma will move to its permanent 
residence -- a complex of buildings along the capital's Okhotnyy 
Ryad thoroughfare and Georgiyevskiy Pereulok. Repairs are under 
way in these buildings to replace old fire-hazardous partitions. 
This was reported in an interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents 
by Sergey Filatov, leader of the Russian President's 
Administration. In his opinion "the Russian Federation 
president's edict has written the final chapter in the epic of 
the State Duma's accommodations." 
  The lower house of parliament will be temporarily 
accommodated in the Russian Management Academy in the 
southwestern part of the capital. The president's 
administration has counterarguments against protests from the 
Russian Management Academy collective. The point is that the 
audit carried out by the Control Administration under the 
Russian Federation president revealed numerous infringements of 
tax discipline by the Russian Management Academy leadership. 
Thus, numerous commercial structures which rent the academy's 
premises are either not officially registered at all or do not 
pay taxes to the state budget. 
  As is known, under the Russian Federation president's edict 
the Russian Management Academy will move to the parliamentary 
center building on Tsvetnoy Bulvar.

  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry said a balanced and quiet approach is necessary to the 
scandal over the arrest of CIA agent Aldrich Ames on charges of 
spying for Russia and said it has a number of questions which 
need to be clarified. 
  "A balanced and quiet approach, devoid of excessive 
political 
emotions" is necessary in the case, spokesman of the Foreign 
Ministry Grigoriy Karasin told TASS on Wednesday. 
  He added that the Foreign Ministry learned about the arrest 
from official information from the United States. 
  "It is quite natural that we have questions about the merits 
of the information. Many things are to be clarified. This is a 
job for corresponding special services of Russia and the United 
States", Karasin said. 
  He added that "as far as we know, cooperation (between the 
services) is being developed in such spheres as anti-terrorist 
and anti-drug fight and these contacts should be used". 
  Ames and his wife were arrested on Monday during a joint 
operation of the CIA and the FBI.

<F P=106> [Andrey Streletskiy report under the "Secret Services" </F>
rubric: "High-Ranking CIA Official, Who Worked for Soviet Union 
and Russia, Arrested. His Recruitment and Long-Time Work May 
Undoubtedly Be Recognized as Domestic Intelligence Service's 
Success"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The press bureau of the 
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] would not give 
official comments on the arrest of Aldrich Hazen Ames. A 
"no-comment" response in such cases means an indirect 
recognition of an uncovered agent's cooperation with one secret 
service or another. An informed intelligence expert, who asked 
not to be identified, answering your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent's question whether this incident is the FIS' worst 
setback recently, said: "I would look at the incident from a 
different side and I would say as follows: The fact that our 
intelligence service has had such an agent for such a long time 
is undoubtedly a great success. Undoubtedly, he was worth the 
great amount of money that was paid to him. The situation 
should not be dramatized and the scandals should not be blown 
out of proportion. No one has yet canceled intelligence 
activity after all. Our agents do in the United States just 
what theirs do here, nothing more. As a matter of fact, when we 
catch their spies we do not demand that their diplomats be 
expelled. It would be most unwelcome if this episode causes 
tension in Russian-American relations. The United States needs 
us just as we need them."

  [Text] London February 23 TASS -- "I am very pleased with 
my visit and hope that it will be successfully completed," said 
Azeri President Geydar Aliyev in Wednesday night, addressing the 
British Royal Institute of International Relations. Aliyev is 
currently on an official visit to Great Britain at the 
invitation of the British Government. 
  Aliyev said that on Tuesday, he had talks with 
representatives of different British companies and British 
entrepreneurs. On Wednesday, Aliyev met with British Prime 
Minister John Major. "The talks were held in a friendly 
atmosphere and I believe that they were a success," Aliyev said. 
  During the talks the sides signed a number of bilateral 
documents, and the most important is a declaration on friendship 
and cooperation between the two countries. 
  Aliyev pointed out that it was the first visit of the Azeri 
president to Great Britain. "We attach great importance to the 
visit since we look upon Great Britain as a country which has a 
great political weight on in the international arena, 
long-standing traditions and which plays an important role in 
the world economy," Aliyev said. 
  The Azeri president called upon British and international 
companies to develop mutually advantageous cooperation with 
Azerbaijan, which possesses not only oil, but other valuable 
mineral resources. 
  The Azeri president promised to give investment guarantees 
from the Azeri Government and the president. Aliyev pointed out 
that Azerbaijan had given up Communist ideology, socialist 
economy adding that there would be no return to the past. 
  The Azeri president said that it is ready to develop 
relations of equality with all countries, attaching special 
importance to relations with neighboring countries. "We have 
normal relations with Russia, Turkey, Iran, Georgia," the Azeri 
president said. 
  Aliyev paid particular attention to the armed conflict 
around 
Nagorno-Karabakh. He accused Armenia of aggressive intentions. 
"However, we have not taken an aggressive and intolerant stand 
and believes that the two neighboring countries can live in 
peace and accord as it was in the recent past. Azerbaijan 
firmly abides by the principle of the peaceful solution of the 
conflict and believes that the United Nations and the U.N. 
Security Council, the CSCE Minsk Group and such leading 
countries as Russia, the United States and Great Britain can 
make a tangible contribution to the peaceful settlement."

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 23, BNS -- "The border was of course 
violated in this case," Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gylys said, 
commenting on unauthorized transit of a Russian echelon through 
Lithuanian territory Feb. 19. 
  The Russian echelon crossed the Lithuanian border from the 
side of the Kaliningrad region last Saturday [19 February] 
without any official permission of Lithuanian authorities and 
even without an advance warning. The train carried 26 infantry 
fighting vehicles, which were escorted by armed Russian 
soldiers. The Russian servicemen did not have special 
permissions for carrying weapons on Lithuanian territory. 
  Lithuanian authorities let the echelon pass, to avoid any 
accumulation of military equipment near the state border. 
Lithuanian border officials followed the echelon until it 
crossed the country's eastern border and entered Belarusian 
territory. 
  On Tuesday, Gylys called in Nikolai Obiortyshev, Russian 
ambassador to Lithuania, to explain the incident. 
  "I spoke with Ambassador Obiortyshev, we analyzed the 
happening and I asked that the Russian side pay attention to 
this unpleasant event and that such cases are not repeated 
again," Gylys told Lithuanian TV. 
  Judging from the interview, Lithuania did not register any 
official protest over the incident. 
  The Lithuanian minister noted that Lithuania and Russia do 
not have any treaties on military transit. Russian military 
transit from the region is carried out in accordance with the 
established order of Russian transit from Germany via the 
Mukran-Klaipeda ferry. 
  But Gylys pointed out with satisfaction that Russian transit 
is mainly outward bound, i.e. moves from the region to Russia. 
The minister said "only fuel and other goods, food but not 
weapons, not soldiers" move in the direction of Kaliningrad.

  [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur received Eugen 
Preda, general director of the Romanian radio station, at his 
Chisinau residence today and gave an exclusive interview. 
  President Mircea Snegur said, among other things, that at 
the 
recent congress entitled Our Home, the Republic of Moldova, he 
mentioned, as he had done before, the same historical events and 
the need to preserve our brotherly ties, and, as he specified, 
to stick to our kin. 
  At the same congress, he emphasized that the policy promoted 
by the Republic of Moldova is consistent in all areas and is 
linked to reality and the nation's desire to consolidate its 
statehood and to develop as an independent state. 
  Speaking about the same policy, Snegur mentioned that the 
directions of economic and cultural integration between Moldova 
and Romania remain the same. 
  In connection with the Ilascu case, the Moldovan president 
said that he prefers to act rather than talk and that his 
intentions remain the same, namely to have these political 
detainees transferred to the constitutional legal bodies of the 
Republic of Moldova. 
  In connection with the meeting of the interministerial 
commission, recently held in Bucharest, Snegur affirmed that it 
has opened up very positive prospects for mutual economic 
cooperation. It is necessary to speed up and activate tangible 
relations between economic units; the meeting was assessed as 
encouraging for the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Gornaya: "Entrepreneurs Suggest That the </F>
President `Shower' Russia With Flowers"] 
  [Text] At the end of last work week, on Friday, there was a 
meeting between Yu. Meshkov and representatives of the Union of 
Entrepreneurs of Crimea [SPK]. Crimean business is actively 
establishing closer ties with the new authorities. Actually, 
they looked pretty good sitting at the same table during this 
meeting--the president of the Republic of Crimea, Yu. Meshkov, 
and the president of the Union of Entrepreneurs, A. Dudko, a 
gifted economist and the same kind of "generator of ideas." 
  From the first minutes of the meeting a completely friendly 
atmosphere was established (to be sure, after a time of tense 
anticipation: The president was detained), and then it was 
reinforced by assurances of mutual support. 
  A. Dudko gave a short briefing to the president of the Union 
of Entrepreneurs, which unites 14 regional divisions and more 
than 2,000 enterprises with hundreds of thousands of workers 
and, together with the leasing collectives, it is larger than 
the state sector. In addition to enterprises, the SPK includes 
banks and funds (including the recently created imeni E. Memetov 
insurance fund for fighting terrorism), and social 
organizations, and the Crimean Institute of Economics and 
Business Law, which it founded. The union maintains close 
business contacts with a number of far- abroad countries, 
particularly the Bavarian Academy of Management, where Sergey 
Shuriga and Aleksandr Dudko defended their doctoral 
dissertations. At the present time, the SPK is faced with the 
task of reorganizing itself to meet European standards in order 
to gain the opportunity to conclude tariff agreements with 
unions of employers of Europe. 
  Regarding the current economic situation, A. Dudko noted 
that 
the entrepreneurs were especially alarmed by Ukraine's 
forthcoming monetary emission of 30 trillion, which can be 
advantageous only to the military-industrial complex of the 
continental part of the state and could bring complete ruin to 
Crimea. It will be pointless to do planting in the spring, 
because the production cost of agricultural products will rise 
so high that it will be much less expensive to deliver them from 
abroad. As immediate measures the entrepreneurs asked the 
president to issue edicts that would make it possible to 
stabilize the financial situation in our republic to a certain 
degree. 
  SPK members who spoke at the meeting-conference expressed 
ideas and proposals aimed at economic improvement of Crimea. 
Naturally, the first thing all of them mentioned was the urgent 
task of reforming the tax system. They also spoke of the need 
for all- around support for small and medium-sized business in 
the situation of practically complete collapse of industry that 
has developed. The entrepreneurs are prepared to suggest to the 
president the corresponding programs and a package of normative 
documents. 
  They also discussed concrete assistance to our republic, 
which can be provided because of personal contacts with 
entrepreneurs in Russia. In particular, P. Sukholeyster, a 
member of the council of the League of Entrepreneurs and 
Cooperators of Russia, reported that there is an agreement with 
the Republic of Komi for the delivery of 250,000 cubic meters of 
timber to Crimea. 
  An original idea was expressed by Professor N.M. Pavlenko, 
first vice president of the International Intergovernmental 
Organization of Grapes and Wine. As he sees it, flower growing 
could be a real Klondike for Crimea. Half of Holland's economic 
prosperity is based on this branch. And what do they have that 
Crimea does not? A warm climate, a good scientific base--the 
Botanical Garden--and a large airport. President Yu. Meshkov 
liked the idea and, incidentally, he reported that there is a 
preliminary agreement on the creation of the Crimea-Russia 
airline company, which has been backed up by the delivery of 
aircraft fuel. Briefly, there will be technical possibilities 
of showering Russia with tulips, carnations, and Crimean roses. 
  Those in attendance were very excited over the presence of 
the chairman of the republic Unity trade union, Ya. Reznikov. 
This time he not only spoke about his pet idea of tripartism, 
but also mentioned that there is a unique plan of "crazy fans 
from Alushta" to hold the Olympic Games in Crimea. Delirium? 
But no Winter Olympics has ever been held with a view of the 
sea. It is also possible to show off with the hypothesis that 
the legendary Atlantis is not far from Crimea. But to consider 
practical things, hosting the Olympics could bring Crimea the 
kind of investments that would make it a center of international 
tourism and a flourishing health resort for all time. Of 
course, one is almost automatically reminded of New Vasyuki.... 
But sometimes absolutely improbable things happen in real life. 
And indeed, why not? If there were the desire and enthusiasm. 
At least this idea seemed to evoke enthusiasm from the 
president, and he has proved to us through action that the 
person capable of original thinking will win. 
  Yu. Meshkov expressed his readiness to consider attentively 
the prospects for entrepreneurial activity proposed by the SPK 
and their vision of changes in the areas of economics, law, and 
state structures. He emphasized that the Bavarian contacts of 
the Union of Entrepreneurs and the proposed rate agreements were 
especially valuable to the republic. 
  The president also stated that strict steps would be taken 
to 
subdue mafia structures, which are not halting their activity. 
Honest entrepreneurs have a right to count on reliable 
protection from the state.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Boris Yeltsin to the Federal Assembly </F>
in Moscow -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed chairmen of the Federation Council and the 
State Duma, esteemed members of the Federation Council, esteemed 
deputies of the State Duma: It is with special feeling that I 
have stepped to this podium. Today's address is an 
extraordinary event in my life and in my political career. It 
is the first time that the new Russian parliament is to hear the 
president's address. 
  Russia begins to chart its policy in a new way. Writing this 
address was not an easy task. The difficulty was because I 
wanted to put too many things into it. We need to accomplish 
still more. Therefore, it is important not to dissipate our 
efforts and concentrate everything--our resources, political 
will, intellectual potential, and the people's enormous desire 
to live better--on the key areas in order to achieve the results 
together. 
  This is why not only the present situation but also the 
ideas 
for the future proposed by you--including those put forward 
during the election campaign--are reflected in this address. 
  Regrettably, in 1993 a lot of energy was expended on tough 
political confrontation. Extreme measures could not be avoided, 
either. But we prevented civil war. People could see for 
themselves that there would be no winners in an irreconcilable 
struggle. It can have only one result--the destruction of 
Russia. The time of internecine strife has expired completely 
for Russia. 
  There were successes and profound disappointments on the 
path 
of reforms. But if you ask me today if I would start these 
difficult changes again, the answer will be unequivocally yes. 
Both then and now I am convinced that there was no other path. 
In January 1992 we were forced to start something we could not 
avoid. 
  We are gradually learning lessons during every month of our 
lives. It is impossible to transform a country like Russia in 
one attempt. What is needed is a flexible, long-term, 
anticipatory policy that takes into account Russia's 
peculiarities, the national character, and changes in the public 
interests and moods--the mentality of the people of 
Russia--which for decades was being molded in a different 
direction. 
  In the last few months we have come to understand better one 
important truth: In order to achieve success, we need to bring 
into play tremendous and so far almost unused reserves--the 
reserves of cooperation in constructive work. This is an 
indisputable requirement for all of us, for those who have 
entered parliament, for those who are prepared to share the 
responsibility for Russia's destiny. 
  Let us be realistic and let us acknowledge that a part of 
the 
opposition still wants to take revenge by force. On both sides 
there are those blinded by the need to take revenge on their 
ideological opponents. However, hatred and the thirst for 
vengeance can only worsen Russia's serious illness. 
  I want to say another thing: Social accord is not 
forgiveness for all. Compassion is compassion only when it does 
not contravene the law and moral standards. There is a 
foundation for accord in Russia today: the 
Constitution--adopted by a popular vote. Let us ask ourselves: 
Is there another, more solid foundation? There is not. 
  No one party, no one movement, no one group of 
intellectuals, 
no one politician or statesman has the same degree of support 
today as the Constitution. It won the votes of people of the 
most varied convictions and outlooks. Having lost faith in many 
things, they nonetheless went to the polling stations and gave 
to the state a law that is binding, above all, on those who are 
in power. 
  Our country is experiencing today one of the most complex 
moments of its history; however, Russia did not begin with Peter 
the Great or the October Revolution of 1917. It does not end 
with the collapse of the communist superpower. The empire that 
not long ago intimidated all of mankind while suppressing real 
life for the Russian people and all of its other peoples is no 
more. 
  The Russian state, however, has still not taken a worthy 
place in the world community. We no longer have the state that 
acted as a strict supervisor and ruthless judge toward its 
subjects. We should also acknowledge, however, that there is 
still the absence of a fully democratic and lawful state in 
Russia. 
  Most people are constantly worried about what tomorrow will 
bring, about the future of their children and their elderly 
parents. But the authorities, both in the center and in the 
regions, seem not to notice the rapid stratification of society. 
One has to act responsibly and acknowledge that we are 
underestimating all the dangers this stratification brings. 
  I am not calling for a return to universal egalitarianism in 
poverty, to the notorious dispossession of the kulaks. But in 
this matter, in this extremely fine matter so painful for 
society, one should not allow the process to be totally 
spontaneous and uncontrolled. 
  We are painfully learning that a bureaucratic and 
self-devouring economy, in which 10 people are doing what one 
person can normally do, has no future. But so far we do not 
have a normal market economy either. It is those who cheat and 
use violence who are at ease. The honest, enterprising people 
who are not afraid of working and taking risks find it extremely 
difficult today to start their own business and grow. 
  All these are today's realities, however hard it is to admit 
it. True, our country has greater freedom, but this is not 
enough. Our task is to ensure that Russia has greater justice, 
security, and confidence in today and tomorrow. We have already 
seen that it is impossible to build Russia properly at the will 
of some manager, party, or individual. The time has come for a 
new political style of trust and constructive cooperation, 
mutual understanding, and agreed action. The time has come for 
a nationwide action that can unite efforts of all of us. We 
have such an action. It is the strengthening of statehood, the 
strengthening of the Russian state. Let's acknowledge at last: 
As long as we have a weak state, there is no basic law and 
order in the country. All residents of the country and all 
peoples of Russia are interested in a stable and strong state 
because all of us, irrespective of our nationality or place of 
residence, need civil peace and not interethnic conflicts. All 
parties and political movements and all factions of the State 
Duma should be interested in strengthening the state. It is 
only in a sound and strong state that they can count on an 
honest implementation of the interests of their supporters. 
  Our closest neighbors have a vested interest in the Russian 
state being stable and strong, for it is precisely a strong 
Russia that is the most reliable and realistic guarantor of 
stability for the whole territory of the former USSR. 
  The world community also needs a strong Russia; otherwise, 
it 
will be a permanent source of threat to security and to mankind. 
A strong and vigorous state is a most important condition for 
the continuation of transformations in our country. A healthy 
and civilized market will not gain a firm foothold without such 
a state; nor will democracy reveal its true worth or the great 
Russian culture and morality be reborn. The strengthening of 
our state is an indisputable goal that can and should unite all 
Russian people in this dramatic period the country is going 
through. 
  The strengthening of the state is a task for us all. It will 
make it possible for the president, the Federal Assembly, the 
government, and the constituent parts of the Federation to all 
channel their energy for the good of Russia. 
  We began this work many times over the past few years; 
however, until now it had no legal basis to underpin it and was 
carried out in a chaotic and inconsistent manner. The state, in 
its current configuration, fails to cope with its most important 
functions. This pertains, above all, to safeguarding order and 
the rights and safety of citizens. 
  The country is being engulfed by crime. To this day, the 
existing state structures are permeated by a spirit of 
irresponsibility and arbitrariness. Life in our country is 
still bound up in innumerable petty restrictions and 
limitations. The work of both central and local authorities 
suffers from much confusion and incompetence. The army of 
bureaucrats is rapidly growing. In a situation of heightened 
financial tension, the federal authorities, with amazing ease, 
are spending vast sums of money on themselves. This growing 
appetite is doing more to undermine the state's reputation than 
any mistakes or miscalculations. This is not to mention the 
taxpayers' pocket: It is their money that supports all of us. 
  All this testifies to the fact that a new alienation between 
the authorities and the everyday needs of the people is 
appearing and has appeared. If bureaucracy previously stood 
between them and the nomenkatura caste, then today money must be 
included as well. 
  It is precisely the disgrace of corruption that is 
increasingly often the gulf preventing a solution to many 
issues. This is what I was speaking of: the grave illness of 
Russian statehood. The task to unite us today--the president, 
parliament, and government--is to stop these destructive 
processes. We do not have to create anything. We have only one 
effective medicine and that is to strengthen the state on the 
basis of the Constitution. 
  This will produce a result if we work together. We need a 
common program of state reforms in the Russian Federation. Its 
strategic aims are: 
  First, the state authorities should work not for themselves 
but for the precisely identified and formulated interests of 
Russia and its citizens. This means a shift away from the 
policy of impulsive reactions toward a strategy of considered 
anticipatory actions. 
  Second, power should be effective. This means the desire and 
ability to finish off what has been started and to assess very 
toughly any possible shortcomings in the decisions made. 
Judicial reform occupies an important place here. A strong 
third estate does not weaken but, on the contrary, strengthens 
the other estates. I attach particular importance to the 
Constitutional Court, which should objectively interpret the 
Constitution. Local self-government needs to be developed and 
provided with legislation. In this connection, perhaps there 
could be joint consideration of the timing of elections. 
Serious attention needs to be paid to reform in the army, to 
regulating the state border regime, and much more. 
  Third, an end must be put to the apparatus free-for-all, in 
which any sensible decision or initiative is stifled in the 
death grip of the apparatus. The method is known: the clear 
regulation of functions and responsibilities. Unfortunately, 
this is absent thus far. 
  Fourth, power must become open and understandable for 
people. 
This means that dialogue needs to be developed, the formation of 
a civic society needs to be promoted, and we should not cut 
ourselves off from the mass media, but rather help them to 
pursue the policy of constantly removing state control from the 
press--although, there needs to be moderation here as well, of 
course. 
  The television channel that, via the Orbita system, 
preserves 
the integrity of the Russian information zone and encompasses 
the near abroad and European countries, should have the state as 
its proprietor. 
  A strong state is essential, above all, to combat crime. 
This is the most important issue of the year. In this respect, 
our cooperation is especially necessary. The public awaits from 
the Federal Assembly laws on which the state can rely to defend 
their safety and tranquillity. I think that it is correct to 
combine two ideas here. The first is to continue preparation of 
new criminal legislation. The current legislation is hopelessly 
out of date, and it is increasingly difficult for the 
law-enforcement agencies to use it to oppose criminality. The 
second is to adopt laws designed to resolve urgent issues of 
providing the law-enforcement agencies with the essential 
statutory documents. 
  Rapid drafting and adoption by parliament of a law on 
extraordinary measures to suppress crime should be the first 
move in this direction. Russians will accept such a decision 
with understanding. The law-enforcement system is also ready 
for its implementation. Our mutual task in this area is not to 
sink into a state of affairs in which extraordinary emergency 
measures are again becoming institutionalized. We should not 
allow any infringement of citizens' rights. We should give 
necessary powers to the law-enforcement agencies. We should 
also mobilize all the state and public institutions for fighting 
crime and clearly define their tasks and their responsibilities. 
  Tired of waiting in vain for the federal legislative acts, 
authorities in a number of regions have already started 
implementing similar measures themselves. By doing this, they 
have succeeded not only in putting criminal situation securely 
under control, but also in improving it. 
  We have no right to economize on ensuring a secure 
environment for our people in the present day situation. 
However, we should finance only the clearly-defined areas and 
programs aimed at fighting crime. A number of these have 
already been drawn up and adopted. Together with long-term, 
wide-scale measures, it is urgently important to implement 
measures to combat street violence. Organized crime needs 
special attention. Today its aim is to strangle the country. 
Only by joint, decisive, and consistent actions will it be 
possible to protect Russia from it. Specialists have been 
suggesting such actions for a long time. 
  One of those measures are enshrined in law is to allow 
law-enforcement bodies to use the potential amassed in the last 
few years to launch sustained blows on organized crime and 
corruption. 
  For all the people of Russia, strengthening the state has an 
additional profound meaning. We are talking about preserving 
the country. Russia is too dear to us to even think about its 
disintegration. Unity cannot be ensured by force or deceit. It 
cannot be preserved by setting some peoples against others. A 
path of federalism is a path toward truly strengthening Russia. 
It is clearly outlined in the Constitution. This does not 
mean, however, that a federation has already been built. 
  The delimitation of powers and property between the federal 
authorities and the constituent parts of the federation is 
proceeding extremely slowly. During this year, this matter must 
be sorted out. 
  Another no less important task is to build the vertical 
structure of federal power in Russia. It is in the interests of 
the federation that regions are granted maximum opportunities in 
governing, but the functions retained by the federal authorities 
must be performed in a coordinated manner throughout the 
country--be it the system of national security, in the power 
engineering complex, in the communications network, in the 
information network, and so on. 
  It is the task of the year to surmount the clear injustice 
with regard to regional benefits and privileges. Standard 
criteria for the extension of benefits from the federal taxes 
and credits are needed as the very air we breathe -- the clearer 
they are, the less abuses there will be. 
  Interethnic conflicts, both within the country and near its 
borders, pose a real threat to the stability of the Russian 
Federation. Such conflicts are the result of previous 
injustices and mutual grievances. Internecine strife and the 
number of such conflicts grow day by day, hour by hour -- and 
the longer this goes on, the more complicated it becomes to find 
a way out and to heal the new and deep wounds. 
  Our country is more interested than anyone else in 
eliminating interethnic conflicts. For as long as Russia feels 
that it is a frontline state, there will be neither peace nor 
prosperity in Russia. Practice has shown that apart from 
Russia, no one is ready to take upon themselves the heavy burden 
of peacemaking in this area of the world. Hence, our country's 
role is all the more important and responsible. 
  Time is inexorably moving on. It is already 50 years ago 
that one of the most monstrous crimes of the Stalinist regime 
was committed -- repressions against whole peoples. 
Deportations added shameful pages to our country's history. 
  On behalf of the Russian Federation, the successor of the 
former Soviet Union, as head of state, I apologize to all the 
citizens of Russia and their families who suffered from the 
deportations. It is our civic duty to eradicate the 
consequences of those terrible events. This difficult and 
delicate work should unite and not divide, us. It should bring 
people together and not breed further strife. 
  It is our duty to make 1994 a year of undivided attention to 
the problems of the people of Russian origin who are living in 
neighboring states. We have at our disposal a great number of 
facts that are clear proof that our compatriots are being 
subjected to discrimination. It is Russia's obligation to 
strive -- not in words, but in deeds -- to ensure that such 
practices are stopped. If one is talking about an infringement 
of the lawful rights of the Russian people, it is not the 
exclusively internal affair of one country or another, but it is 
our own, state, national affair. I ask -- I even demand -- of 
all branches of Russian state power that they follow this 
principle rigorously. 
  I would also like to speak about our compatriots who are 
returning to Russia from the new neighboring states to their 
permanent homes. For the present they are not the children but 
the stepchildren of Russia. There is no let-up in the flood of 
settlers and refugees, but this means that one must no longer 
accept the fact that no one takes their problems seriously or 
carries true state responsibility. This is an immense problem. 
A special program has already been worked out, and it will be 
submitted by the government for endorsement by the Federal 
Assembly. But in order for it to be implemented, what is 
necessary is a pooling of our efforts and a concentration of 
means. 
  Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of 
the State Duma: We have learned from our own experience that we 
will not overcome the economic crisis or ensure the genuine 
market order or make the economic situation predictable or 
create prerequisites for the economic growth without a strong, 
able state. 
  I know that after the December elections and changes in the 
government, people both in Russia and abroad became worried 
about the country's future economic course. I want to dispel 
these worries. As long as I remain the president I will defend 
and maintain the policy of economic transformations. In 1994 a 
continuation of the economic reform will be one of the most 
important directions of Russia's domestic policy. 
  Some important elements of market relations have already 
emerged, such as economic freedom, the right to own property, 
and working markets of goods and services. However, it is too 
early to say that the Russian economy lives by laws of the 
market. Now we have a combination of new market trends, which 
are still weak, and of old command levers. The system of 
administration and distribution has not disappeared without 
trace: It has reshaped itself. Bureaucrats who used to deliver 
plans and allocate funding have now entered the market and are 
now distributing and often even trading in centralized credits, 
export quotas, and licenses. 
  There is a continuing and strengthening trend toward 
lobbying. Reform of the economic mechanism is proceeding very 
unevenly. 
  The result is well-known; the crisis is abating slowly. 
Output is continuing to fall, viable enterprises are closing 
down, the country is tormented by inflation, and tension in 
society is consistently high. The greatest mistake that could 
be made today is to offer the public false alternatives: the 
previous state-run command economy, or the so-called pure market 
that is absolutely independent of the state. Both options are 
ruinous for Russia and for the Russian economy. 
  The task is to find a sensible correlation between the speed 
of reform and the realistic social price to be paid for it, to 
enlist the powerful but as yet poorly used reserves within the 
reforms, and to seek the optimum form of state involvement in 
economic processes. 
  The past two years have shown that not only reform incurs a 
social price. Still greater damage is being done by an economic 
mechanism that is long overdue for change. It is time to 
establish an effective state regulation that is compatible with 
market mechanisms. This is one of the most important threads of 
the current phase of the reforms. 
  The state should treat the state sector of the economy as an 
owner, otherwise the confusion will not be overcome and the 
squandering of the state sector by certain economic managers 
will not be halted. The policy toward liberalization of exports 
needs to be continued while, at the same time, state control 
over the export of strategic raw materials and energy resources 
from the country needs to be toughened. 
  It is vital that the government strengthen currency controls 
and sanctions against offenders who are illegally concealing 
currency resources abroad. Legislation needs to be changed. 
Standards designed for an economy of centralized planning and 
financial autonomy [khozraschet] are of no use now. Russia 
needs an up-to-date and effective civil code. Its general 
section has already been prepared, but I would ask the 
government--which is conducting this work--to take account of 
the provisions of presidential decrees, primarily those 
concerning the economy. I intend to send the draft civil code, 
as a whole, for examination by the Federal Assembly this year. 
  The year 1994 should be the year of the start of real 
structural reorganization of the Russian economy. Russia should 
only produce what is required by the individual, state, or world 
market. The country should stop producing products nobody 
needs. Of course, this is a very complex and costly task. It 
cannot be solved in a short period of time, and especially, by 
bans. This does not mean, however, that one should keep 
avoiding it. Can it be that the government is still not 
convinced that the absence of structural policy will bring about 
structural degradation? It is already happening. We are 
gradually losing modern technological infrastructure and most 
valuable productions--first and foremost, hi-tech productions. 
We are lagging behind not only world achievements, but we are 
already lagging behind ourselves. The principle that says that 
those will survive who can survive is ruinous. It is not those 
who produce the best-quality output with the consumer in mind 
who currently survive in Russia, but those who enjoy the most 
perks and privileges, those who enjoy the authorities' 
protection, and those capable of beating money out of the 
government. If this tendency continues, the Russian economy can 
and will become a market-based economy, but it will be primitive 
and inefficient at the same time. It is high time the 
government decide on structural priorities and act proceeding 
from this. 
  Is there anything that prevents us from clearly defining 
the membership of a group of producers which are of strategic 
and great social importance to Russia, producers which are 
highly competitive in the world markets? Specialists estimate 
that this kind of group would not account for more than 10 
percent of what is produced in Russia. It is precisely such 
producers that must be given normal state support over the next 
few years, while others should find this support substantially 
cut within specific limits. 
  It is time to define what output is needed by the state and 
in what volume. I have here in mind defense orders, too. 
Directors of major enterprises have repeatedly put the same 
request to me: to influence the government, so that the 
government may let it be clearly understood to them whether or 
not to produce this or that kind of output. It is just a yes or 
a no. A yes means that financial obligations taken upon oneself 
are fulfilled; a no means that no impediments are placed in the 
way of the process of conversion. 
  A demonopolization of production in Russia is a most 
important reserve of reforms. You cannot have normal economy 
while one enterprise dictates to others its own conditions, just 
because it happens to be the only one of its kind, producing its 
particular line of goods. Monopolism in Russia took decades to 
take shape. It was, in fact, a state policy, costing gigantic 
sums and resources. Demonopolization will, likewise, require 
tremendous effort and time. It must be started in real terms. 
  Investment policy can also be implemented during reform. 
There is talk of an investment crisis and a lack of state money 
to support industry, yet vast sums are being pumped into 
selected sectors and enterprises. Meanwhile, as before, there 
is no real investment activity. Order can be imposed only on 
the basis of a clear investment policy, the role of which is 
greatly magnified in conditions of crisis, inflation, and the 
state's highly restricted financial possibilities. 
  It is high time for the government to establish a single 
procedure for the granting of state support and to strictly 
monitor how such support is used. 
  We hear endless talk about inflation being incompatible with 
the process of investment. With so much talk, there is almost 
no time to form the necessary institutions and structures to 
develop legislation in this sphere. Little practical work is 
being done to create real conditions for attracting foreign 
investments. This is the criticism I hear at every meeting with 
foreign businessmen, be it in America, in England, in Japan, in 
China, or elsewhere. 
  At the same time it is obvious that as long as our own 
entrepreneurs do not start to invest in Russia's economy, 
foreign partners will refrain from making major investments. 
  The Russian state has to be consistent in defending the 
interests of Russian companies in the domestic and world markets. 
  There are other reserves. After the completion of the 
voucher stage, privatization has to be taken resolutely into a 
new mode. It should attract investors, both Russian and 
foreign. This year the privatization should give the economy 
much more than before. 
  The year 1994 should become the year in which the state 
gives 
real support to the producers. In a system like this, any 
honest enterprise or entrepreneur can only die a painful death. 
It is impossible to live honestly. Nor is it possible to 
collect all that is due to the state. Last year, the budget 
revenue was to have been between 24 and 25 trillion rubles, but 
in actual fact it amounted to 17 trillion. That's what high 
taxes have achieved. The system of taxation should become 
simpler, easier to understand and, most importantly, stable -- 
at least in the next couple of years. 
  In 1994, it is time to embark on drastic changes in state 
support for the agricultural sector. Rather than meeting all 
the demands from the sector, the main principle should be a real 
reform of its economic mechanism, above all ensuring the right 
of private ownership of land. 
  The country has been living for a long time in the 
conditions 
of constantly high inflation. Until the inflation is curbed, 
the crisis cannot be overcome. 
  Any actions by the federal authorities in the area of 
economic policy must undergo an inflation safety test. The 
maximum allowed level of inflation must not be exceeded. This 
demand will be ensured also by the constitutional powers of the 
president. The economic reform is never painless. Its social 
cost is significant. We should focus on poverty, on striking 
inequality, and employment. They cause the greatest concern. 
The president, the Federal Assembly, and the government should 
constantly keep in mind hardships experienced by workers of 
enterprises coming to a standstill--who may become unemployed 
tomorrow--the poverty experienced by many scientists and staffs 
of higher educational establishments--which makes unbearable the 
lives of many young families--and also difficulties experienced 
by a significant proportion of farmers. 
  Millions of people in our country are living below the 
poverty line. It is unacceptable to adopt for implementation 
state programs that cause a further decline of essential 
standards of living. However, we have such programs. 
  Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of 
the State Duma, everything I am describing is part and parcel of 
tense, day-to-day work that should now be seriously addressed. 
There is vast room for action here for ministers, deputies, and 
staff of the apparatus--for everyone, in a word. If we really 
come to grips with it, then all political discord, offenses, and 
empty disagreements will be forgotten. Everyone will benefit 
from this, and primarily Russia. The main thing is not to stop 
and not to waste time. 
  In strengthening the Russian state, we should all pay 
particular attention to culture, science, and education. These 
are vital conditions for our country's progress. One has to 
admit with bitterness that this area has become a disaster zone 
today. Without strong state support, spiritual freedom turns 
into the destruction of talent and into intellectual poverty. 
It is time to admit that culture will not survive without the 
state actively participating in its future. It is the state 
that should preserve the common cultural heritage in all its 
wealth and diversity, and it is the state that should provide a 
specific program for the development of the multinational 
Russian culture. 
  Yes, there is an acute shortage of funds today; however, the 
state should pursue the kind of policy that would make the 
spiritual sphere one that powerfully attracts financial and 
material resources. In 1994, this sphere should become a zone 
with most-favored status. Federal, regional, and local 
authorities, and any entrepreneur should receive real incentives 
to providing active backing for this. I support setting in 
motion a system for capital to flow into culture, education, 
science, and health care and, let me add, ecology. Not only we 
will benefit from this. Above all, it will be our descendants 
and the Russia of the future that will benefit. 
  To continue reform of Russian foreign policy is one of the 
guidelines for strengthening Russia. Over the latest period, it 
is not only Russia that has changed beyond recognition. The 
whole world has become more complex and unpredictable. 
Consistent promotion of Russia's national interests is the main 
task of our foreign policy. Openness and cooperation are prime 
means for achieving it. But if required to protect the state's 
legitimate interests, Russia has a right to act firmly and tough 
when it is really necessary. Until recently our foreign policy 
lacked initiative and creative approach. Russia's prominent 
peacemaking initiative in the Bosnian conflict has been an 
exception, regrettably, so far. Meanwhile, the present-day 
world needs a novel look at the global problems and goals of the 
21st century, and Russia is capable of generating new major 
original ideas. 
  We like to repeat that it is a great country, and this is a 
fact, indeed. So let us always maintain this lofty standard in 
our foreign political thinking as well. We have clear 
priorities in international policy--the most important being the 
prevention of a new global war, either cold or hot. It is for 
this purpose precisely that we are coming out unequivocally in 
favor of strengthening the regime of non-proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and the latest military 
technologies. We share this principle as one that is mandatory 
for all--not only for Russia, as some people would like to 
believe. 
  In 1994, we have to put an end to the vicious practice of 
unilateral concessions. This also relates, inter alia, to the 
defense budget. One should not forget the fact that defense 
expenditures are something totally different from expenditure on 
war. 
  These resources are being used to finance a major part of 
our science sector, these resources are being used to build 
housing for homeless officers' families, these resources are 
being used to provide for our children serving in the armed 
forces. 
  There must be order in international arms trade. The most 
important condition for this is observance of Russia's 
commercial interests. They have suffered considerably in recent 
years. 
  We are for being realistic when dealing with the problems of 
European security and we are for the Partnership for Peace, open 
to all states of great Europe without any exceptions. 
  However, while respecting the sovereign rights of states and 
organizations, Russia is against the expansion of NATO through 
some or other countries of the European continent without Russia 
itself. This is a path toward new threats to Europe and the 
world. Russia is not a guest in Europe, but an equal 
participant in the community of Europe, interested in its 
prosperity -- and it is this premise that we will proceed from. 
  We are for developing partnership with both West and East. 
But for us, partnership is not an exchange of niceties during 
negotiations but real cooperation and interaction, in all 
spheres from high politics to friendly social contact between 
people of different countries, in all spheres at state and 
national level, at the level of enterprises, companies, 
organizations, and individual citizens. The obstacles to such 
wide-ranging partnership should be removed as soon as possible. 
  Russia did not take part in the race to be the first to 
leave 
the USSR and to become the most independent state. Now many are 
gradually being cured of the euphoria of being able to swim in 
the raging sea at will. We are returning to one another within 
the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia 
is for the strengthening of the Commonwealth, above all through 
the establishment of an economic union, a common CIS market, and 
the establishment of a system of collective security and the 
strengthening of guarantees of human rights. 
  However, there exist factors which it is always essential to 
take into consideration. Integration should not damage Russia 
itself, nor should it be effected at the cost of our forces and 
resources, material and financial alike, being stretched to 
breaking point. This would only entail new disappointments and 
it would not bring our states closer, but pull them apart from 
each other. 
  Russia's foreign policy will be strong and effective if 
interaction between various state bodies in its implementation 
is secured as something tangible. I address this request, in 
equal measure, to the relevant departments of the executive 
authority and to the Federal Assembly -- we have one country and 
it will only gain from this kind of interaction. 
  Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of 
the State Duma, I regard it as essential to spell out the most 
essential things, on which concern, including my concern, will 
be focused this year. 
  First: Law and order must gain a firm foothold. We are not 
just talking of adopting high quality laws; we must also aim at 
their implementation. Without that, it will not be possible to 
put an end to official abuses, nor will it be possible to ensure 
guarantees for people's legitimate rights. 
  Two: the fight against crime. We won't make life more 
peaceful for the people of Russia if we confine ourselves to 
emergency half-measures. We need a complex of legislative, 
economic, organizational, and social measures. To fight crime, 
one has to change conditions in society and in the state as a 
whole. 
  Three: the economy. I intend to resolutely continue and 
develop the reform started in 1992, using its reserves to the 
maximum, fully keeping in mind the price that has to be paid on 
this path. 
  Four: concern for the country's spiritual future. The 
current state of culture, science, and education is, as I have 
already mentioned, extremely alarming. This year an upturn 
should be ensured in these spheres. 
  Five: Support for the regions and territories and the 
protection of their interests. Much has already been said on 
this matter. I can add that last year the drafting of the 
principle of a new regional strategy in Russia began. This year 
the strategy will be actively implemented. It is on this basis 
we shall be able really to ensure the unity and integrity of 
Russia. 
  Six: the future of Russians in the near abroad. This 
problem requires constant and painstaking work, combining 
firmness with delicacy, being consistent and reacting precisely 
to the changing situation. I believe it is my duty to defend 
the prosperity and dignity of our fellow countrymen wherever 
they may live. 
  Seven: stepping up Russian foreign policy. Here the 
qualitative parameters of equal partnership are coming to the 
forefront. The key area is strengthening the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  We have established normal relations with the majority of 
world states and have joined the main international 
organizations. Now the main thing is, proceeding from national 
interests, to make the potential of these ties fully effective 
in Europe, in America, in the Asia-Pacific region and in other 
areas. 
  Russia has the opportunity for beginning a qualitatively new 
stage of its development. The period of total destructive 
processes of the previous system is ending. We are laying the 
economic, legal, and social foundations of a new Russian 
society. Having received your proposals in response to my 
message, I am addressing you with a specific plan of my actions 
to put it into practice. 
  I know that there are those among you who doubt whether we 
will be able to cope with these tasks, given the spiritual and 
ideological discord that reigns in society and in our hearts 
today. But we must provide an answer to this question together 
-- not in tedious and fruitless debates but in real 
collaboration. Only in common work will we be able to overcome 
mutual suspicion and bring back trust in one another. Only by 
common work will we be able, once and for all, to push back from 
Russia the threat of confrontation and to achieve stable civic 
accord. Only in common work will we be able to tear through the 
black shroud of uncertainty and restore spiritual balance and 
find ourselves in the new conditions. 
  Russian citizens expect cooperation from us. I am confident 
they will support us because they want security on the streets 
and in their homes; they will support us because they want 
Russia to be peaceful and prosperous. I hope that in a year we 
will all be able to look those who elected us in the eye and 
say: Things were difficult for us, but we did in the space of 
this year all we could, and it is not in vain that we lived 
during these past 12 months. 
  For my own part I will do all I can toward this end. Thank 
you for your attention.

  [Text] Moscow 24 February TASS -- "President Yeltsin's 
message to the deputies fully suits Russia's needs. It 
reflected topical matters of Russia's development, consolidation 
of the state and all its institutions, stregthening of law and 
order in Russia", Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's Choice 
parliamentary faction, said on Thursday. He spoke at the 
colloquium "The future of reform in Russia" held in St. 
Augustin, Germany. The colloquium was organised by the Konrad 
Adenauer foundation close to the Christian Democratic Union. 
  The Russian president could have spoken more definitely on 
economic matters, believes Georgiy Zadonskiy, influential deputy 
of the State Duma. "I followed closely Boris Yeltsin's message 
to the Federal Assembly. I believe it has not set out a firm 
economic course", he told ITAR-TASS. "This can be used both for 
continuing the deepening of reform and for trying to consolidate 
the power of bureaucrats which the president mentioned". 
  Zadonskiy said he has no sense that the president and the 
government have adopted a common stand for adjusting reforms. 
He believes Yeltsin remains on positions of reform, but 
vagueness on matters of state regulation of the economy is quite 
dangerous. 
  "The president's message to parliament leaves an ambiguous 
impression", said chairman of the communists faction in the 
State Duma, Gennadiy Zyuganov. Nevertheless he welcomes 
Yeltsin's ideas for the consolidation of statehood and 
separation of powers between subjects of the federation. 
Zyuganov told ITAR-TASS that the meeting between the head of 
state and parliament on Thursday "looked like a dialogue". He 
said the report did not have signs of the search of an enemy. 
Quite the contrary, it was an attempt to rally forces for the 
sake of normalisation and reconciliation. 
  Zyuganov still believes the Russian Federation will be 
unable 
to cope with any of its problems unless there is a renewed 
union. From this viewpoint he approves of the fact that the 
president attaches priority to the strengthening of ties within 
the Commonwealth of Independent States. Zyuganov again deplored 
the fact that Russian leaders had not set themselves this task 
earlier, in the framework of the union.

<F P=106> [Feature consisting of two reports under the rubric </F>
"Attention, Danger!" First report by Igor Mosin: "Shivering by 
Nuclear Stove." Second report by Vladimir Gubarev: "Fission as 
Social Disease"] 
  [Text] Desnogorsk, Smolensk Oblast -- The first step has 
been taken toward shutting down Russia's nuclear complex. The 
Smolensk AES [nuclear power station] has reduced electricty 
production by 30 percent. The Kursk, Leningrad, and 
Novovoronezh AES's will be forced to follow its example in the 
coming days. 
  I walk down the AES' long deserted passageways together with 
its director. Now only duty personnel and security are working 
here. 
  "Where does the paradox of the current situation lie?" A. 
Zemskov, chief of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy public 
relations board, asks. "In the fact that AES's provide 
consumers with electricity which is half as expensive as that 
produced by thermal power stations. But the `YeES Rossii' 
Russian joint-stock stock company -- the organization involved 
in the distribution of electric power and collecting money for 
this -- `treats' its consumers as if all power is produced at 
thermal stations. And continually raise their prices. Typical 
monopolist mentality. If we had the opportunity to supply power 
directly to consumers, it would cost them exactly half as much." 
  There is a normal working atmosphere at the power station's 
control desk. The director requests personnel to prepare to 
reduce capacity. They show no concern. 
  Five, 10, 20 minutes pass. The operator pulls some levers 
and presses some buttons. Figures flash up on a monitor. 
Capacity has begun to be reduced. Somewhere behind the nuclear 
reactors' very thick walls the nuclear processes have begun to 
slow down. You see it is all very simple and commonplace. 
  How might events develop in the future? Today AES's are 
shutting down because they do not have the money to buy fresh 
nuclear fuel. The "YeES Rossii" Russian joint-stock company is 
50 billion rubles [R] in debt to the Smolensk AES alone. In all 
this respected monopoly is more than 350 billion in debt to the 
nuclear complex. To be fair I must say that consumers are 
considerably in debt to the "YeES Rossii" Russian joint-stock 
company as well. This is another of the age's economic 
paradoxes. Gasoline is selling like hot cakes but the oil 
refineries are shutting down. Electricity is in a similar 
situation. 
  If the AES's do not get the money owed them in the near 
future, they will reduce their capacities to 40, then 50 [figure 
as published], then 20 percent. Then a full shutdown will 
occur. [end of Mosin report] 
  The crisis in Russia's nuclear power industry is increasing 
-- you can count the days the fuel will last at the AES's. 
  Enterprise directors have been meeting for several days now 
at the "TVEL" concern, which produces nuclear fuel, in order to 
find a way out of the crisis. 
  What has the nuclear power industry thought up? 
  Uranium pellets are produced at a combine in 
Ust-Kamenogorsk, 
Kazakhstan. From there the pellets have to get to 
"Mashinostroitelnyy Zavod" in Elektrostal, where rods are 
produced, and only then do the rod assemblies go to the 
Leningrad AES. This well-known AES worked "for nothing" last 
year -- it produced electricity but received no payment. 
Consequently, it is unable to pay for the fuel from 
Elektrostal, which in turn is not paying for the uranium tablets 
to be produced. What is more, Ust-Kamenogorsk is now in a 
foreign country, so that there are in addition all sorts of 
interstate complications here.... 
  The "new economic plan" devised at the "TVEL" concern is as 
follows. The Ust-Kamenogorsk combine is in debt to Kazakhstan's 
power system for electricity, the latter is in turn in debt to 
YeES Rossii, and it has already built up a debt of many tens of 
billions of rubles to Leningrad AES. Mutual clearing 
settlements are made along this chain. Plants in Izhora are 
also not settling their electricity bills. Now Izhora is going 
to give away its excavators which Kazakhstan needs and which it 
cannot pay for, and in their place uranium pellets will go to 
Elektrostal. The only thing is that you cannot pay the 
enterprises' workers either in uranium pellets or excavators. 
  Superficially, the "new system" of payment looks attractive: 
The plants work and the AES's are not shut down. But it was 
barter which was preeminent in the feudal period, and which 
finally made that state system collapse. 
  The Russian nuclear power industry produces the cheapest 
electricity. According to the conclusions of international 
experts, it worked in as reliable and efficient manner last year 
as the Japanese, and according to the majority of indicators 
surpassed the French and in particular the Americans. I must 
repeat that these figures come from international organizations! 
The only thing is that we and the government are making 
incredible difficulties for it (seemingly deliberately!). 
Unfortunately, we simply have not heeded the lessons of 
Chernobyl and are unable to learn from our own misfortunes.

  The Federal Assembly is beginning its work at a crucial and 
dramatic period of Russia's history. The decisions to be 
adopted by the legislative and executive organs of power will, 
to a large extent, determine not only Russia's future but also 
whether we will remain plunged into crisis or whether a slow and 
painful recovery will begin -- this is the question. Let us 
recall that 1992 has gone down in Russia's history as the year 
when mortality rate exceeded birth rate for the first time ever 
in peacetime. The situation deteriorated still further during 
the first nine months of 1993 -- deaths have already exceeded 
births by 500,000. The existence and survival of the 
nation itself is in jeopardy. 
  Before a cure can be started, it is necessary to arrive at 
an 
accurate diagnosis, in other words to appraise soberly and 
without prejudice the situation in which the country finds 
itself. To understand the causes of such tragic events. It is 
necessary to abandon the habit of making analysis and appraisal 
fit in with the goals pursued by different political parties. 
The interests of the country and of the people as a 
whole must, at long last, come to the foreground in deed 
and not just in words. 
  On this basis it will become possible to take the path 
toward 
accord between different political forces. After all, due to 
the existing split, it is impossible to elaborate a correct 
policy and pool efforts to implement a joint program for 
extrication from the crisis. 
  The following must be one of the main principles of state 
policy at this stage: Protection of the country's national 
interests on the basis of science, pragmatism, and national 
accord. 
  The authors' collective does not in any way claim that the 
material it offers is consummate or complete. We have attempted 
to identify approaches toward the solution of problems. Some of 
them are only outlined in the text. The important point is that 
those in whom the right to make decisions is vested should be 
given an opportunity to choose from the broadest possible 
range of substantiated proposals. 
  Unfortunately, today there are frequent occasions when 
incorrect and wrong decisions are not only proposed but are also 
adopted, with the consequence that the state and society suffer 
afterwards. In order to avoid this, it is necessary to 
encourage by all possible means the elaboration of various 
drafts and options for political decisions by independent 
experts and submit them for broad discussion. 
  Such an approach is especially important when working on the 
complex problems of the state's security and development 
strategy since many important questions have hitherto been 
studied and practically resolved in isolation, and this has 
caused and continues to cause enormous harm. It would seem, for 
example, that the correct decision to attain parity with the 
NATO countries has resulted in a sharp weakening of economic 
security. The pursuit of gross indicators and the lack of a 
systematic and intelligent concept of the habitat have produced 
ecological disasters with the most serious impact on the 
biosphere as a result of anthropogenic activity (Chernobyl, 
territories in the Far North, and virtually all industrial 
regions). 
  All this was apparently undertaken for the sake of the 
security of the country as a whole, although it had a negative 
effect on it, let alone the irrational expenditure of vast 
quantities of material resources. 
  Look at the latest examples. While talking about conversion, 
we have in reality ruined the military-industrial complex, 
withdrawn from the world arms markets, and are now incurring 
huge foreign currency losses because the market has been 
captured by the Western countries. 
  To curb inflation.... How could anyone object to this? But 
the methods used to implement this concept have become one of 
the factors paralyzing the economy, which has led to strikes and 
the shutdown of enterprises with all the ensuing consequences. 
  Neither the president, nor the Federal Assembly, nor the 
government, nor any other state organ, comprising the most 
competent and experienced people, could elaborate in depth and 
comprehensively consider and adopt substantiated decisions on 
questions of state security unless the sessions of these organs 
are preceded by a thorough scientific elaboration of the 
problems under consideration. 
  There is also a need for consultations with scientific 
institutions and leading scientists and specialists. A series 
of questions also require international cooperation, because in 
our time it is impossible to contain the elaboration of security 
problems only within the national framework. 
  History has proved that it is impossible to achieve 
security for the country and peace and tranquillity for its 
citizens by military force alone. This is easy to comprehend if 
the term "security" is extrapolated to the individual, the 
nation (the people, the state), and the international community. 
  A nation can achieve tranquility and function normally only 
if it is confident that it will not be subjected to devastation 
by war and that it will not die out from an AIDS epidemic or as 
a result of an ecological crisis; that its economy will undergo 
stable development and will not only save the country from 
famine and ruin but will also prevent any potential aggressor's 
illusions about the likelihood of winning a war against it; that 
a developed system of legislation and legality will protect the 
nation from unbridled crime and will ensure the harmony of the 
interests of all strata of society, of all peoples of Russia, 
and of each individual. 
  In this special supplement to the RAU Corporation's 
information and analysis weekly OBOZREVATEL-OBSERVER, experts 
from centers and authors of the journal offer their 
own alternative strategy for Russia's extrication from the 
crisis. It is meant for people elaborating and adopting 
political decisions or actively participating in their 
preparation. Primarily for deputies of Russia's Federal 
Assembly. Thus, this supplement is a concept of Russia's 
development in 1994 and a kind of digest of ideas and materials 
by the Corporation's creative collectives. 
  With most profound respect for our subscribers, readers, and 
opponents, 
  [Signed] Doctor of Historical Sciences A. Podberezkin, RAU 
Corporation president and academician of the Russian Academy of 
Natural Sciences 
<H5>  National Security: Russia in 1994 </H5>
  Today, more than ever before, we need a critical analysis of 
the path we have traversed and a clear objective for society's 
further development. After all, we find ourselves at an 
historical crossroad: There is no turning back, but we still 
have to choose the new road. Within a very brief period of 
time, the country has moved from one historic period to another: 
  -- there has been a radical change of state structure; 
  -- an end has been put in Russia to the previous political 
system, which was underpinned by the CPSU's monopoly of power 
and ideology; 
  -- a headlong change is under way in the correlation of 
forms 
of ownership in Russia and, correspondingly, in the entire 
system of social interrelations; 
  -- there is a growing accumulation of interethnic 
contradictions within Russia and of problems with former USSR 
republics which are now sovereign states; 
  -- there has been a fundamental change in Russia's position 
in the world community and in its mutual relations with foreign 
states. 
  In this context it is necessary to clearly define the 
current 
and long-term Russian national interests which correspond with 
the interests of individual citizens and of society as a whole. 
It is necessary to highlight those on which the very existence 
of our state depends. 
  In our view, the main point today is to prevent the 
weakening 
and collapse of the Russian State. But how is this to be 
avoided? 
  Having defined the priorities, it would be expedient to 
elaborate a program of reforms in the interests of society as a 
whole and not in the interests of individual groups. This 
program will obviously be nationwide. It must be comrehensible, 
realistic, and pragmatic, it must not be burdened by any 
political bias. Citizens have the right, and even the duty, to 
know what kind of "bright" future they are offered, how will 
reforms be implemented, and how long they will take. They are 
fully entitled not only to ask questions about all this but also 
to altogether disagree with the proposed program and ultimately 
to demand an account of the government's activity. 
  The way to national accord must be sought on the basis of 
respect for the individual and each citizen's rights regardles 
of party, religious, or national affiliation. 
  What we need today is a government capable of finding a way 
out of the crisis. Only a program geared to the needs of the 
majority of the population will enjoy the population's support. 
This is also the only way to achieve the consolidation of all 
progressive forces. It is necessary to curb inflation, restore 
confidence in the ruble, and create a normally functioning 
financial-state mechanism geared to support for producers rather 
than for dealers. 
  How do we propose to begin? 
  FIRST, to abandon the excesses of political struggle and to 
strengthen legality, law and order, and elementary executive 
discipline without which any power is doomed to anarchy, in 
other words to strengthen the state. 
  SECOND, to undertake a series of measures to improve living 
conditions for the Russian Federation's citizens, and primarily 
for the least well-off section -- pensioners, children, the 
sick, and those unable to work. 
  THIRD, to uphold Russia's unity and its economic and 
political independence. 
  FOURTH, to revive Russia's spiritual potential. 
  THE MAIN THREAT is the weakening of power and statehood. Any 
weakening of any of the branches of power means the weakening of 
power and statehood as a whole. It is extremely shortsighted to 
sow the branch on which you are perched. It would be much wiser 
to reciprocally strengthen the representative, executive, and 
judicial branches of power. 
  We offer for your attention an analysis of the situation and 
a package of measures to strengthen the state. 
<H3>  Section I: I. Preservation of Civil Peace, of an Integral 
and Independent Russian State </H3>
<H6>  1. Preservation of Civil Peace and Accord </H6>
  Armed conflicts and local wars are increasingly often waged 
along Russia's borders. The fatherland is on the threshold of a 
war which could begin either on its borders or beyond them. It 
has, in fact, already begun. Therefore, the main 
task today is to prevent its escalation into all-out 
war. For this purpose we need primarily national 
unity and accord. No matter how the situation in the 
country may develop, it is impermissible to make the state 
dependent on "victory" by different views or political forces. 
Politicians and their ambitions, even the most outstanding 
ones, come and go, but Russia lives on. Any political victory 
would turn into defeat if a blow is dealt on statehood and 
society slides toward confrontation. 
  It is impossible to achieve stability and accord in society 
unless an end is put to the division into "ours" and "theirs," 
into "correct" and "guilty." There is already widespread use of 
the terminomoly and methodology of psychological warfare, which 
are used during preparations for the conduct of combat 
operations against opponents who will have to be sooner or later 
destroyed. The division of citizens into "victors" and 
"vanquished" is a state crime, because it leads directly to 
civil war. 
  In order to avoid this and halt this movement toward direct 
confrontation, leading politicians should be made to, 
first, abandon personal (party) interests 
in the conduct of affairs and promote state interests 
to the foreground. Second, to find within themselves 
the courage to cease the endless search for "enemies" and 
declare the responsibility and repentance of all for 
the catastrophe which has befallen Russia. Our history shows 
that precisely this spiritual-moral approach has always 
underpinned Russia's extrication from crisis. 
  In this context it is necessary to impose a direct 
legislative ban on the propaganda of enmity equating 
it with calls for civil war, and introducing penalties for 
the publication of unverified information detrimental 
to the state and to civil peace (but without preventing 
journalists engaging in criticism based on facts). 
Democracy and its principles must become a means for 
strengthening rather than weakening the state. 
  Not a single political force can or should claim 
to be absolutely correct, and consequently to exercise absolute 
power. It is necessary to consolidate all forces in society 
without dividing them into "reds," "whites," "browns," and so 
on. This approach has proved pernicious for our statehood over 
the last few decades. 
  The economic chaos today has been compounded by interethnic 
conflicts, the collapse of moral foundations and cultural 
heritage, and finally the crisis of political power. 
  Instead of a middle class which, in all civilized societies, 
comprises the scientific, technical, and creative 
intelligentsia, skilled workers, and entrepreneurs, we have 
created a minute privileged stratum of dealers while the 
remaining strata are undergoing headlong lumpenization. At no 
time and in no place has this path ever created a reliable 
support for democracy and state power in society. It is 
paradoxical but for many years on end the state has 
pursued an antistate policy aimed at the disintegration and 
elimination of its most important institutions: the Army, 
national domestic policy, and the state security system. 
  The most acute problems facing the state today are: 
  a) to prevent a civil war; b) to strengthen 
the state institutions; c) to prevent Russia's 
collapse; d) to overcome the socioeconomic crisis and 
save the nation; e) to preserve science, culture, and 
education. 
  Cadres pose an especially acute problem. When promoting 
people to the levers of state administration, society envisages 
a system of measures to train administrative cadres. All over 
the world (including prerevolutionary Russia), any citizen who 
wishes to become a professional politician has to go through the 
school of upbringing, education, and practice before he is 
allowed access to political activity in local organs of power. 
In order to be launched into state-level orbit, the candidate 
has to climb a long ladder of practical work and training. In 
the United States, before a citizen can hold prominent office, 
he is polished in a prestigious university and in the course of 
work abroad, in the ministries (including the State Department 
and the CIA) or party apparatus, in Congress, and so on. The 
result is a skilled functionary meeting the needs of his 
society's ruling circles, but even here mistakes cannot be 
avoided. 
  The polarization of political forces and their growing 
confrontation (taking the most uncivilized forms in Russia) not 
only did not end with the elimination of the Russian Federation 
Supreme Soviet, but are actually intensifying. The 
election campaign considerably stimulated this 
process. Consequently, it is probable that one section of 
the ruling elite will succeed in crystallizing into a clearly 
defined party structure which will attempt to establish control 
first over the government and then over the president, de 
facto reviving the one-party political system. The 
accession of such a party to power will, in turn, inevitably 
lead first to a clash between the president and the Federal 
Assembly, and then to a leadership struggle within the ruling 
party itself. Unfortunately, the history of the USSR and the 
CPSU offers us numerous tragic examples of such development of 
events. 
  In this context, from the state's point of view, there is 
need for measures for legislative and political regulation 
of party activity, making provision for temporary 
suspension of the activity of all parties and 
sociopolitical organizations in the event that the nature of 
their political activity becomes damaging to the state's 
security. 
  This kind of decision -- and this is of fundamental 
importance -- must be made and monitored by the supreme organs 
of state power subject to one immutable condition: 
Political decisions must under no circumstances 
become the prerogative of executive and monitoring organs 
like the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the Ministry of 
Security, the Prosecutor's Office, and so on. In our view, the 
ideal authority to make such decisions would be the 
judiciary. 
  The real strengthening of the aithority and potential of 
the judiciary must become a priority task in Russia's 
state building. 
  Basing our analysis on the supreme interests of the state 
and 
the nation, we have concluded that firm authority is 
needed today. The most effective, indisputable, and 
bloodless form for Russia could be an interim presidential rule 
monitored by the Federal Assembly. 
  If we were to leave aside political bias and the ambitions 
of 
political leaders and forces desiring to make capital out of 
discord in Russia, we are confident that many of our fellow 
citizens would agree: Even an imperfect leader of the nation is 
better than a group of political leaders looking primarily after 
their own interests and corrupt elements straining to come to 
power. 
  During the most difficult times in Russia's history (feudal 
strife, invasions, the Time of Troubles), the country emerged 
victorious having mobilized all its resources and the 
spiritual potential of the masses under a single leader's 
leadership. The Soviet era was no exception, seeing that 
Stalin's dictatorship was objectively a positive factor of 
victory in World War II and of the country's reemergence from 
the ruins. 
  The press occasionally writes that Russia today feels not 
only the urgent need but even the inevitability of the 
appearance of an authoritarian regime capable of extricating the 
country from the crisis. 
  Some people assume that Russia has already taken this path 
and therefore the question is not how to avoid a transition to 
authoritarianism but to choose its most acceptable form 
and the method for transition. We, it is said, have 
already diverged from the possible forms and norms of a 
developed democratic state in the transition period. It is 
therefore necessary to accept this fact as an objectively 
existing reality and, second, to try and find a method -- 
peaceful and the one most acceptable for the state -- of 
transition to one of the more preferable forms of 
authoritarianism. 
  This assumes that new qualities will be demanded of the 
representative of the authoritarian form of rule: Leader of the 
nation rather than of a party; staunch defender of the state and 
its interests rather than leader of reformers; a builder rather 
than a destroyer, in other words a major revision of the 
priorities and values which have been dominant in the last few 
years. 
  The list of these character qualities could be logically 
extended to include a serious change in the disposition of 
political forces: The transformation of recent allies and 
friends into political opponents and the obverse -- the 
attraction of broad strata of professionals and specialists not 
committed to any one political party or movement. 
  It may happen that, instead of authoritarianism, we could 
end 
up with incessant struggle, intrigues by different groupings, 
parties, and juntas, and attempted coups -- with the State and 
the Nation at stake. Any such struggle, which has become an 
accepted form of existence for these leaders and a part of their 
essence, will inevitably and for a long time to come 
hinder and delay the stabilization of the situation in the 
country and will weaken our might. 
  The country's earliest possible extrication from the crisis 
and the gradual formation of durable democratic foundations of a 
civil society are important for Russia because real democracy is 
possible only in a society where there are no mortal 
threats against the State and the Nation. 
<H6>  2. Improvement of the Federal Structure, Prevention of 
Regional Fragmentation </H6>
  What should Russia be like following the disappearance of 
the 
superpower -- the Soviet Union -- from the world map? Its 
former Constitution calls it the Russian Federation. But is 
this really true? 
  A genuine federation is possible only when two or 
several states are united and, as a rule, it is based on 
lasting integration without the right to "secede." The autonomy 
of a union state's components is guaranteed insofar as it does 
not threaten the state's unity. Precisely this principle was 
used in forming the majority of federal states existing today: 
the United States, Switzerland, Canada, Germany. 
  True enough, some other states also style themselves as 
federations -- Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, India, and 
Spain, for example. Essentially, however, they are unitary 
states with a certain amount of autonomy for their provinces -- 
pseudofederations in the classic sense of the word. World 
experience has shown that a durable federal state is possible 
only when it is formed by autonomous states keen to 
unite by dint of various vitally important reasons. More 
recent historical examples already prove that any attempts to 
create a federation out of immature national and territorial 
formations inevitable engender instability and disintegration, 
which swiftly lead to the collapse of newly formed states or the 
formation of a unitary state. 
  The Soviet Union was a federation only in name, proclaimed 
by 
its Constitution, but in essence was, in our view, a typical 
pseudofederation. It is well known that a treaty between a 
series of republics was concluded in 1922. But, in the strict 
juridical and legal sense, not a single one of the components 
agreeing to the union was a state. 
  As for the RSFSR [Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic] 
as one of the contracting parties to the creation of the USSR, 
from the very beginning it was also a pseudofederation -- both 
in form and in its inner composition. 
  The conclusion of the Federation Treaty in its present form 
did not solve the problem, either. With whom did the Federation 
components conclude the treaty? With the federal state 
structures, to be precise. If they represent a single state, it 
emerges that the Russians -- its numerically largest people, 
comprising more than 80 percent of the population -- are 
dispersed among the Federation components since their own 
statehood is not even mentioned. Furthermore, Tatarstan and the 
Chechen Republic did not sign the Federation Treaty, while the 
stance of a series of republics and regions as regards the 
distribution of powers is threatening the Russian Federation's 
unity. It is fair to ask: Is the newly emerging Russia not a 
worse variation of the same old pseudofederation? 
  It has to be objectively noted that, ever since the collapse 
of the Russian Empire, the ethnic Russians have been 
gradually losing their statehood. 
  This is the fundamental question of our community's 
development: In view of all that has been said above, will 
Russia be able to become a genuine federal state? 
  The fatherland's history contains several examples of 
attempts to impose a federal unification of territories -- 
during the Kievan period right until the invasion by the Golden 
Horde, during the Suzdal-Muscovy period, during the Time of 
Troubles, and in 1917 right after the February Revolution. 
  It is, of course, possible today to blame the Soviet power 
for failing to take everything into consideration when forming 
the sovereign republics, but the main point is that many 
peoples acquired or restored their statehood precisely thanks to 
the Soviet power. 
  The pull toward integration and unity of the peoples of both 
Russia and the former USSR stems from numerous factors. The 
territory which they inhabit -- Eurasia. Throughout the many 
centuries of their existence, these peoples have on many 
occasions united within state formations and have produced 
unique cultures and single spiritual areas. They perceive 
Eurasia as their "motherland-continent" whose fate is 
inseparable from the fate of each one of its peoples. 
Experience shows that whenever the Eurasian ethnic groups have 
failed to reach accord, their lands have become easy prey for 
aggressors. The struggle for Eurasia's repartition could 
disrupt the world geopolitical equilibrium and cause a global 
catastrophe. 
  Another common feature of Russia's peoples is the highly 
polyetnnic nature of all newly formed states. Only six of the 
multitude of Russian peoples claim more than 50 percent of 
indigenous population in their republics (the Chuvash account 
for 69 percent, the Tuvinians for 64 percent, the Komi-Permyak 
for 60 percent, the Chechen for 58 percent, the Buryat in 
Aga-Buryat Autonomous Okrug for 54 percent, and the Ossetians 
for 53 percent). The average "indigenous population" in all 
Russian Federation republics is 32 percent, and even less -- 
10.5 percent -- in autonomous okrugs. It is simply impossible 
to divide all this into some sort of state formations. The 
following conclusion suggests itself: Russia's peoples are 
destined to live in one state -- federal in spirit and form. 
  So, what are the ways to solve the national-state 
question in Russia? There are two main dangers apparent in 
the possible development of nationality processes today. The 
first is the uncontrolled explosion of Russian nationalism 
as a natural defensive reaction to the threat of Russia's 
fragmentation and to the insult of national dignity, taking 
the form of the Russophobia and chauvinism typical of some 
former Union republics and of individual national regions in 
Russia itself. But the establishment of nationalist 
dictatorships is no solution. The lamentable experience of such 
dictatorships and regimes in a series of states which emerged on 
the territory of the USSR offers convincing proof of this. 
Territorial and state collapse is, as a rule, the price that 
has to be paid for the triumph of "national ideas." 
  The second danger lies in the attempts to turn Russia back 
to 
its prerevolution state structure, dividing it into guberniyas. 
In practical terms, this would mean the forced colonization of 
national republics. The rights which non-Russian peoples have 
acquired can no longer be withdrawn or curtailed without 
tragic consequences for them and for the Russian nation. 
Russian or any other nationalism will not only lead inevitably 
to the destruction of Russia's integrity but will also render 
the statehood of these very peoples just a pipedream. 
  The ideal way to a genuine federal state is to conclude 
a full-blooded federation treaty between the 
republics. 
  Russia's krays and oblasts as Federation components 
must enjoy equal rights with the republics, with a 
possible subsequent establishment of new integrational 
formations (guberniyas, laender). The more extensive the level 
of self-government, the more lasting will be the real 
integration between Federation components, including the 
"Russian regions." 
  The comprehensivess of this integration eliminates the 
problem of the Russian nation's possible "self-dismemberment" in 
the event that krays and oblasts are elevated to the level of 
republics. Thus, federalism could be founded simultaneously on 
the national-state, national-territorial, and territorial 
principles, which would be most in line with Russia's specific 
features. There is need to constitutionally enshrine the rights 
of national groups and the guarantees of cultural autonomy. 
  In this process it will be important to sensibly 
distribute powers between central and local organs of power and 
administration. 
  Since the two organs of power -- parliament and government 
-- 
combine all the original features of a multinational state in 
the persons of deputies and members of the government, they 
would appear to personify to a large extent the components of 
the Federation and their peoples, and then the center's 
authoritarianism within the limit of its powers would be 
accepted with understanding. 
  On the other hand, authoritarianism in the form of a 
presidential republic in Russia's specific conditions could 
spark off conflicts which would be diffitul to overcome and, in 
the event of the adoption of decisions which may be 
disadvantageous for some of its components, it may even prompt 
national agitation and protest. 
  Nonetheless, experience shows that, at critical 
moments in history, authoritarianism as a temporary 
measure may be necessary and, furthermore, justified. 
  The formation of a genuinely federal Russian state will 
offer 
an opportunity to revive the largely lost ties with nearby 
foreign countries. The timing and extent of this new 
rapprochement of peoples from the former USSR will depend 
primarily on Russia's stability and prosperity. This will 
happen sooner or later and, when it does, the Eurasian continent 
will see the emergence of a new community of free peoples and 
states, qualitatively different from all others in the past, 
mainly due to the genuine federal principle underpinning its 
building. 
  If oblasts, even enlarged ones (Ural Republic, Far East 
Republic, and so on), were to be given the right to have their 
own parliaments, constitutions, embassies, and so on, this would 
run contrary to both international experience and common sense. 
Any sovereignization of administrative oblasts in today's 
conditions will lead to the Federation's transformation into a 
confederation. In light of the current weakening of power, this 
would be the quickest way to the state's collapse with all the 
ensuing economic and social consequences which would be 
extremely serious for all. Evidence of this can be seen in 
the consequences of the Soviet Union's collapse. 
  A strengthening of separatism is also possible even if 
components do not formally secede from the Federation, something 
which can already be noticed today. 
  What attitude should be taken toward the striving of the 
leaderships of some sovereign republics to take advantage of the 
federal state's weakening so as to expand their rights still 
further and acquire a special status in the Federation, 
something like "associate" members? 
  Practice has convincingly confirmed that any excessive 
expansion of components' rights leads to a weakening, and 
even the collapse, of the federation. Cases of secession 
from the federation by joint accord of all interested sides are 
isolated (the State of Singapore from Malaysia). Other 
attempted secessions have usually been put down by force (the 
Sonderbund in Switzerland, the southern states in the United 
States, Biafra in Nigeria, and so on) and, even if they did 
succeed on occasion, this was the result of military operations 
against the federation (the separation of Bangladesh from 
Pakistan in 1970). Naturally, this way to preserve the state's 
unity is unacceptable to us. 
  The states, laender, or provinces comprising federations 
abroad usually exercise only the rights which have been 
either vested in them by the central power or enshrined in the 
constitution on the basis of agreement between the 
components. There is a tendency toward curtailing the 
scope of these rights. They do not enjoy independence in 
international affairs. There are numerous instances when 
decisions by the supreme courts of such federations directly 
indicate that their components are not sovereign (Canada, 
Australia). In Nigeria, and with a view to blocking any ethnic 
separatism, the states' territory has been reshaped in such a 
way as to give them a nationally heterogeneous population mix. 
  Neither the Constitution nor the Federation Treaty of the 
Russian Federation makes provision for the components' right to 
secede from the Federation, and self-determination is exercised 
within the framework of a federal state which is not bound to 
unconditionally grant to a republic's population the right to 
separate, even if such a demand has been backed by the majority 
of the population in a referendum. Any such referendum is 
unlawful, and its results can have only a political, not a legal 
significance. 
  The threats to secede from the Federation which can be heard 
every now and again run contrary to both the Constitution and 
the Federation Treaty, therefore they have no legal effect, and 
-- in our view -- ought to be resolutely cut short. 
  Bearing in mind the vast advantages which the republics have 
already gained thanks to their membership of the Russian 
Federation, their leaders ought to abandon their attempts 
to further expand their rights to the point which is tantamount 
to secession, while the legitimate rights of republics and 
oblasts ought to be covered by additional treaties with the 
Federation. The force of law is better than the law of force -- 
the law enabling its use. 
  The extent of Federation components' rights is determined 
not through barter or some sort of deal resulting in their 
curtailment or expansion. It is clearly predetermined by 
the demands stemming from the principle of self-determination: 
It is impermissible to expand the rights of components at the 
expense of the interests of other nations and all peoples of the 
Federation, which also enjoy these rights. 
  The principle of self-determination protects the interests 
of 
all peoples and curbs national egotism. This is precisely why 
it remains the basis of nationality policy both in the Russian 
Federation and in the world community. 
  Life has proved that any rejection of the Federation on a 
national basis is, in our country at least, impossible today. 
Further advance toward the Federation can take the form of 
more effective protection of individuals' national rights, 
education of people in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity, 
use of two or even three official languages, the strengthening 
of legality, and so on. 
<H6>  3. Elimination of the Seats of Interethnic Conflicts </H6>
  The present status of interethnic relations in the Russian 
Federation and throughout the former Soviet Union's territory 
can be described as a zone of ethnic calamity 
undergoing a complex crisis, where domestic and geopolitical 
factors are intertwined. The economy's normal structure is being 
destroyed (irreversibly in some places) and, from the strategic 
viewpoint, this is more dangerous than the simple slump in 
production to which attention is primarily drawn. State 
institutions are being denigrated, and there is a decline of 
confidence in them and in their authority, which underpins the 
legitimacy of any democratic power. This applies not just to 
any single branch of power but to state power as such, 
without any distinction being drawn between "progressive," 
"democratic," "conservative," legislative, executive, or 
judiciary. Their fruitless confrontation only aggravates 
the discrediting of the state and of power as such. 
  It appears that the collapse of the USSR was neither 
predestined nor inevitable, despite claims by the "architects" 
of the collapse. 
  The selfsame processes of disintegration are today gathering 
pace also in the Russian Federation. In addition to the most 
complex knots of interethnic contradictions we have inherited 
from the past, equally acute problems develop as consequences of 
the current state of the economy, social life, politics, and the 
law. These conflicts are reproduced with growing acuteness and 
on an expanding scale. 
  A most important role here is played by political and 
ideological factors. The shoots of democracy and of 
civilized economics and politics, together with the people's 
hopes for national rebirth, have in many instances become 
hostages of extremist forces, sundry political 
adventurers, and criminal and corrupt structures. Many 
national movements, which emerged as forces pursuing the goal of 
preserving and reviving their people's spiritual originality and 
ensuring their social, cultural, and linguistic survival, have 
now descended to political radicalism and extremism. 
Anarchy and squabbles at federal level lead to the emergence of 
would-be local dictators playing the card of separatism, which 
often conceals nothing but a yearning for absolute power. 
  The ideologists of national "revival" go to extremes in 
their 
relentless battle for power and for access to assets being 
privatized or key positions. They are trying to assert the 
freedoms and rights of one people by trampling the 
freedoms and elementary human rights of other peoples and of 
people from other nationalities living next door to them. 
The leaders of national-democrats, who until only yesterday 
accused the Union center -- and at times even the whole Russian 
people -- of colonizing them and trampling their national 
rights, are today cynically taking actions which transform 
people of other nationalities and primarily the Russian-speaking 
population into second-class people, into outcasts. 
  Experience shows that unless the nationality problems, with 
which the extremists speculate, are resolved "from above" in 
relatively civilized forms, they will be resolved "from below" 
in distorted forms. 
  Despite all the criticism of the Federation Treaty, it is a 
compromise, an attempt to consolidate the balance of interests. 
On the one hand, it is intended to guarantee the process of 
self-government by peoples living in Federation components 
against unjustified administrative-bureaucratic interference by 
the center while, on the other hand, it is intended to prevent 
any national or religious diktat on the state and offer a 
guarantee against any actions ultimately leading to Russia's 
destruction as an integral unified state. Encroachments against 
the Federation Treaty continue to this day. Its destruction 
will pave the way to a new round of political 
confrontation and fruitless struggle. 
  Russia's traditions, even under the toughest regimes, have 
always included the preservation of diversity in the 
self-government of peoples and territories. 
  This political diversity is attainable only if the nations' 
interests are painstakingly taken into consideration and 
coordinated, and if their democratic cohabitation within the 
Federation's framework is guaranteed. At the same time, 
consideration for this originality should not become a cover for 
infringement of the interests of ethnic minorities and of human 
and civil rights and freedoms. The coordination of interests 
and the achievement of agreement presuppose mutual 
responsibility by all parties -- the federal power and the 
organs of power in republics and regions. A real obstacle to 
agreement is created not by the preservation of diversity but by 
the interests of narrow political and national elites pursuing 
goals which are far removed from their officially proclaimed 
ones. 
  On the geopolitical plane, interethnic strife only goes to 
promote the country's transformation into a raw-materials 
appendage of the world economy, a cesspool for the waste of mass 
culture, and a test site for ecologically dirty and dangerous 
technologies, and lead to loss of identity and of Russia's role 
in world politics. Integration in the world's culture 
must not have an obverse -- scorn for one's own history 
and the national dignity of one's own peoples. 
  It would appear that people who determine policy in the mass 
media are deliberately implanting the idea of despondency and 
hopelessness, trying to convince their audience that we are 
living in an uncultured state and only thanks to the 
West's humanitarian aid. 
  A scornful attitude toward history and disregard for the 
traditions, forms of economic management, ways of life, and 
rights of peoples and individuals can be discerned in numerous 
constitutional and political innovations. The ongoing 
destruction of the single constitutional area is alarming. 
Whereas politicians find it easy to adapt to any conditions, 
ordinary citizens are falling victim to constitutional arguments 
and political disturbances, and the price they are paying takes 
the form of loss of jobs, of property, and at times even of life 
itself. 
  The citizens' real participation in political decisionmaking 
is a most important political problem, on which the country's 
future democratic development depends. It is necessary to 
expand the opportunities enabling representatives of different 
peoples to publicize their own interests and their vision of the 
way out of the prevailing crisis. The representation of 
regions and republics as Federation components is not a proper 
substitute for the representation of peoples, be it at a 
constitutional conference or at some other forum. Suffice it to 
ask: How many peoples and how many Federation components do we 
have? After all, the interests of small peoples, divided 
peoples, and other communities must also be reflected in the 
constitutional and political processes. 
  There is a pressing need for a special forum of 
Russia's peoples to examine strategic, political, and legal 
questions from the angle of interethnic relations. Of 
course, this means not the restoration of totalitarianism but 
the restoration of the traditional, tried and tested values of 
the friendship of peoples, of values capable of rallying the 
representatives of all nationalities. 
  At present it is necessary to take advantage of any 
opportunity to halt the processes of disintegration and rally 
the representatives of various nationalities and political 
forces, parties, and movements around positive and constructive 
tasks. There can be no simple solutions to highly complex 
tasks although, unfortunately, illusions to this effect are 
still being nurtured at high levels of power. The solution of 
the nationalities question is one such super-complex task, 
demanding the mobilization of intellectual and political energy. 
Tomorrow the quest for acceptable solutions will be more 
complex, the price will be higher, and the costs will be great. 
  The actual transplanting of the philosophy of "national" 
state ("Russian," "Tatar," "Chechen," and so on) on Russian soil 
is potentially dangerous for interethnic peace in Russia. 
  The causes of conflicts vary: 
  -- historical specific features of the formation of 
territories which have today proclaimed themselves independent 
republics (the sources of conflicts in the Dniester Region, in 
Ossetia-Ingushetia); 
  -- the "automatic" recognition of state border status for 
administrative borders within the USSR is fraught with conflicts 
for all former republics; 
  -- acute confrontation between lay and religious components 
in the new political elites and in former and new political 
groupings (Tajikistan); 
  -- historically aggravated ethnopolitical problems (the 
Baltic countries); 
  -- revival of historical territorial disputes (the Karabakh 
and Crimea problem) 
  -- struggle around the problem of state languages (Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan, a number of now independent republics); 
  -- disputes over the division of Union property, including 
Army property (Russia-Ukraine); 
  -- ethnoconfessional disputes and trends toward the 
formation 
of theocratic states. 
  The cumulative outburst of national feelings 
following the release of communist "clamps" and the uncontrolled 
liberal democracy leading to extreme manifestations of militant 
nationalism underpin the growing national conflicts and clashes 
in the geopolitical area of the former Soviet Union. 
  It is possible to forecast three models for the 
development of potential meganational conflict in the future. 
  The first is associated with the exacerbation and 
growth of ethnic conflicts with differing typology. The lowest 
common denominator comprises violent armed attempts to reshape 
the existing ethnopolitical area. It is obvious that this 
development leads to disintegration of all political, social, 
and technological ties (contemporary Yugoslavia is an example). 
  The second model is associated with the 
reintegration of totalitarianism. This violent way of dealing 
with the nationality problem can take the form of 
military-nationalist regimes ("ethnojuntas"). The most negative 
consequences would stem from the establishment in Russia 
of a nationalist regime with the ensuing restoration of a 
neo-imperial system throughout the geopolitical area. 
  The third model is the sole peaceful alternative, 
presupposing a democratic development. Ethnic tension is eased 
through the building of federal states in a series of former 
Union republics on a democratic rather than a national basis. 
In this process, ties between the independent republics could 
be built according to the model of "permeable" and tolerant 
sovereignty. The desire to prevent an economic collapse in 
post-Soviet states and a complete break of technological ties 
between them and to ease pressure by the "Russian factor" in 
former Union republics will intensify in the face of the threat 
that nationalist regimes may be established. 
  It would be possible, within the third model's framework, to 
halt the catastrophic disintegration of the "Union" economic 
area and to prevent the violent armed dismemberment of the 
single ethnic area on the territory of the former USSR. 
  In our view, it is from these positions that the 
Russian state position on the question of the "Russian diaspora" 
in nearby foreign countries must be elaborated. The USSR's 
disintegration has shifted the Russian nationality problem onto 
a new plane. In the "imperial" Union, the Russians played the 
role of the ethnic integrational components of Union statehood. 
At the same time, an "expansion" of the Russian ethnic habitat 
occurred within that state's framework (more than 50 percent of 
migration flows in the USSR involved the movement of persons of 
Russian nationality). 
  For the first time ever in Russia's entire history we have 
witnessed a breakdown of the Russian ethnic area on a massive 
scale, which in itself is fraught with potential conflicts. In 
several instances the currently independent states are 
forming not democratic but purely national states. This 
inevitably leads to large-scale discrimination against the 
Russian population. We see a "Russian problem" emerging before 
our very eyes, a problem which involves: 
  -- artificial dismemberment of the formerly common Russian 
ethnic area; 
  -- transformation of a considerable mass of Russian 
population in nearby foreign countries into either 
"second-class" citizens (this began everywhere with the laws on 
state languages) or altogether stateless persons; 
  -- the squeezing out of Russians from a series of newly 
formed states; 
  -- potential nationality conflicts in these states and 
intensification of Russophobia; 
  -- inevitable emergence of Russian national movements in 
these states; 
  -- fusion of these movements with a Russian national (or 
nationalist) movement in Russia itself; 
  -- transformation of the "Russian problem" into a decisive 
factor of domestic political struggle in Russia. 
  Two extreme opposites are possible in the development of 
this 
process: 
  a) large-scale interethnic conflict (a series of 
national wars) across part of the former USSR's territory with 
the ultimate establishment of a nationalist neo-imperial Russian 
domination; 
  b) further disintegration of Russia itself along 
nationality lines, which would render the future of 
Russians as a single people extremely uncertain. 
  A third option would be desirable and would result 
in the minimum possible conflicts. It presupposes: 
  -- establishing in the post-Union geopolitical area not a 
national but a multinational statehood taking the form of 
democratic federations (wherever conditions for it exist); 
  -- abandoning the absolute form of asserting the sovereignty 
of the "indigenous nation" and switching to positions of 
tolerant sovereignty of the whole people and all ethnic 
groups; 
  -- squeezing out of power any extremist nationalist 
groups (which has partly happened in Lithuania, for 
example); 
  -- forming an active Russian democratic political 
factor in all post-Union states; 
  -- pursuing a purposeful and thoroughly considered 
Russian policy on these questions. 
  The following guidelines for Russian policy are possible: 
  1. Introduction of state bilingualism in all newly 
formed states (primarily in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, 
Moldova, Latvia, and Estonia). 
  2. Active support for the creation and consolidation 
of Russian-speaking communities including, in several cases, 
their cultural and national autonomy. 
  3. The granting by nearby foreign countries of dual 
citizenship on request to all persons who are citizens of Russia 
by birth, as well as to Cossack representatives. 
  4. Support of initiatives to form local national 
organs of administration and create Russian national local 
"communal administration" in places densely populated by 
Russians. 
  5. Appropriation of funds to support Russian culture 
and education (creation of Russian and Slavic universities, 
schools, newspapers, and so on). 
  6. Pursuit of a tough policy, even including economic 
sanctions, toward former Soviet states where civil rights are 
violated; adoption of a standard "package" of guaranteed rights 
and freedoms for all citizens of the republics, including the 
Russian population, with provision for the granting of 
preferential economic treatment (especially in relations 
with Latvia and Estonia). 
  7. A stepping up of Russian foreign policy efforts in 
support of justified demands for the obesrvation of human rights 
and freedoms in nearby foreign countries. 
  8. Immediate signing of agreements with former Union 
republics on questions concerning citizenship, protection of 
national minority rights, migration, legal aid, pension 
provision, reciprocal recognition of educational diplomas, 
opening of consulates. 
  9. Regular monitoring of positions taken by leading 
political forces in the republics on the "Russian problem. 
  10. Elaboration of short-, medium-, and long-term 
programs for the solution of the "Russian problem" throughout 
the post-Soviet geopolitical area. 
  These are just a few reflections on the conflict-free 
resolution of the "Russian problem." It is obvious that the 
Russian leadership will have to be prepared for counterdemands 
in connection with ethnic problems on Russian territory. 
<H6>  4. Russia Within the System of Newly Independent States </H6>
  Following the Union's disintegration into 15 so-called Newly 
Independent States [NIS], the words written by political 
scientist D. Simes (NEWSDAY) are still valid today: "...the 
`evil empire,' where power was based on violence and compulsion, 
has been replaced by several evils: the emergence of 
interethnic hatred and the clashing ambitions of different 
political elites. Millions of people have suddenly been deprived 
of a community. In these conditions, they have come up against 
intolerance and extremism. Bloody wars, accompanied by 
thousands of victims, are raging in different parts of the 
former Soviet Union." 
  It can hardly be expected that peace, prosperity, and 
tranquility will come to Russia or the other NIS in 1994. 
  Thus, according to data of the U.S. Department of Defense 
Defense Intelligence Service, there are forecasts of 12 
potential armed conflicts on the territory of the former USSR. 
It is estimated that 523,000 persons may be killed in military 
operations during these conflicts, 4.24 million may die of 
diseases, 88 million may be hit by famine, and the number of 
refugees may reach 21.67 million. 
  Ensuring their own safety and that of their families and 
friends is becoming an increasingly topical problem for 
Russians. Whereas this problem worried 31 percent of Muscovites 
in May 1993, this figure had already risen to 42 percent in 
September. 
  The economy is aggravating the situation, and it is still 
hard to expect any swift and major changes for the better here. 
Indeed, according to IMF data, virtually all basic indicators 
in the NIS had declined by an average of one-fourth in 
comparison with 1989-1990, while consumer prices increased 
1,284.6 percent in 1992; in 1993 the volume of GDP will decline 
by 13.7 percent and prices will increase by 940.6 percent. 
In Russia: GDP declined by 12.9 percent in 1991, by 18.5 
percent in 1992, and by 14.9 percent in 1993; monthly inflation 
in the Russian Federation stood at 18 percent in 1993. 
  Unemployment in Russia will affect 3.5-6 million persons 
according to government data and 10-11 million persons according 
to International Labor Organization data; the number of people 
employed in material production in Russia will be reduced by 26 
million in 1991-1995, according to forecasts by the Russian 
Academy of Sciences National Economic Forecasts Institute. 
  The restoration of the protective and reproductive 
functions for Russians is the sovereign state's basic task. 
  In what forms should these functions be restored on a new 
basis? On the basis of democracy and market relations. 
  However, commitment to democracy and market relations by 
itself is not a state idea which can unite multinational Russia 
in a unified state. The birth of specific methods of 
transformation, just like of a state idea, is painful nowadays, 
having to fight through the complexes of the past and the 
contradictions of the present. 
  The basic criteria in this process could be the minimization 
of social losses; the spiritual, humanistic, and moral 
orientation of transformations; and the balancing of the 
interests of the world community and of the Russian Federation's 
peoples. 
  Today, just like in 1991, Russia is facing the task of how 
to 
really become sovereign. An analysis of the past two years 
shows increasingly clearly that not a single one of the NIS, 
including Russia, was prepared either politically, or 
economically, or psychologically for sovereign existence. 
  The end of 1991 saw the formation of 15 protostates without 
borders, armies, monetary systems, infrastructures, state or 
national interests, full-blooded economies, and so on. It ought 
to be concluded that, even today, not a single one of these 
states is "full-blooded" in this sense. Consequently, in 1994 
just as in the two preceding years, their development will be 
determined by the following blocks of problems: 
  a) completing the formation of sovereign states with all 
state attributes; 
  b) creating an effective system of mutual relations between 
the NIS; 
  c) joining the political, military, economic, and other 
systems existing in the world. 
  "Openness" presupposes meeting the other states halfway, 
establishing new mutual relations with them, and expanding the 
sphere of these relations. Conversely, sovereignization of each 
NIS and its separation from the Union would mean drawing away 
from its former neighbors in the "communal state," a certain 
stepping up of autarky, breakdown of existing ties, and 
alienation. 
  This contradiction determined the logic of mutual relations 
between the NIS, which developed in two opposite directions. 
  First, there was an increasingly noticeable 
manifestation of interstate relations: establishment of customs 
regimes and borders. Most republics -- the Baltic countries, 
Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan -- are introducing either national currencies or 
ersatz money on the basis of autonomous emission. The financial 
system is being structuralized. Balances of payments and trade 
are being determined, the former USSR's foreign debt assets and 
liabilities are being divided, debt accounting is being 
established, and so on. 
  Second, integrational feelings are growing, or at 
least the desire for an early break is weakening, in most former 
republics (except Latvia and Estonia, and partly Lithuania and 
Turkmenistan). 
  Nonetheless, today it is still premature to talk of 
integration or disintegration. What we are observing for the 
time being is the coexistence not of the NIS but of real 
authorities at different levels in these NIS. For example, how 
is it possible to treat as part of Russian-Kazakhstani relations 
the tripartite political-economic "union" of Kazakhstan, 
Tatarstan, and Bashkortostan, which was signed in August 1992 
and under which Bashkortostan ceased delivering oil products to 
Russian departments? 
  In 1994 it will be necessary either to make efforts to place 
Russia's relations with the NIS on the firm basis of 
international law, or to create "suprastate" structures with 
powers of authority. 
  It is more than likely that both forms will develop. In the 
immediate future, the formation of civilized relations between 
the NIS will be influenced by the following factors: 
  -- the incomplete disintegration of the USSR, as a result of 
which the subjects of interstate relations have not been finally 
defined. It is possible that their number may be either 
increased (if separatism intensifies in Russia, Moldova, 
Georgia, Ukraine, and so on) or reduced (if the processes of 
integration are intensified). Two fundamentally different 
principles are clearly manifest: the national-territorial 
(separation into autonomous republics and national-territorial 
formations) and the regional (separation into purely Russian 
regions). 
  Analysis shows that the Russian Federation's disintegration 
will hardly end up as a "sovereignty bandwagon" of autonomous 
formations. The "indigenous" etnnic groups represent even a 
relative majority in only 11 out of the 31 national-territorial 
formations. 
  Separatist moods are intensifying in proper Russian regions: 
in the Far East, the Urals, Kuban, Siberia. This has not been 
observed either in the NIS or in East European countries. 
  The following forecasts can be made for 1994: 
  -- retention of an economy with a price structure out 
of kilter with world prices. In 1993 Russia supplied 
products to the NIS at prices equivalent to 30-40 percent of 
world prices while purchasing from them at prices equivalent to 
70 percent of world prices, and consequently Russia had a 
positive balance of about 750 billion rubles in trade with the 
NIS in the first six months; 
  -- deterioration of the situation of etnnic Russians in 
the NIS, having become an ethnic minority there. The 
situation is being aggravated by the fact that virtually all the 
NIS, being multinational, have opted for the nationalist idea in 
strengthening the state. 
  -- "lukewarm" attitudes of the world community, 
primarily of the G-7 countries, toward individual NIS and 
the structure of mutual relations prevailing in the post-Soviet 
area. It ought to be noted in this context that, first, in 
1992-1993 the majority of NIS lost their illusions about Western 
aid but certain hopes remained that some would be integrated 
within the EC while others would draw closer to Asian countries 
and would enjoy their support; second, there is a steadily 
growing economic dependence on the West; and third, there is an 
increasingly clearly manifest tendency by the West to pursue 
mainly its own interests in relations with the NIS (for example, 
squeezing Russia out of the arms market and other technology 
markets, increasing purchases of energy sources from Russia at 
the expense of deliveries to nearby foreign countries, and so 
on). 
  Several systems of collaboration between the NIS will be 
formed in 1994. In one way or another, priority is being 
given to the problem of structuralizing the geopolitical area 
with the aim of boosting stability in the region and the 
management of political processes. 

<H6>    5. Ways to Form a Civil Society </H6>
  Terms like "civil society" and "citizens" have been 
increasingly actively used in our vocabulary recently, whereas 
in the past these terms were virtually unencountered in the mass 
media. And the word "citizen" was used primarily by law 
enforcement organs. At best it was taken to mean the juridical 
unit of the state system. 
  Civil society became the topic of study back in the late 
17th 
and early 18th centuries, in the works of Hobbes, Locke, and 
Hegel. These thinkers perceived the possibility of a relatively 
autonomous social life existing outside state control. 
  There are two approaches toward the civil society in world 
science today: 
  1. As a package of social relations counterposed to the 
state, in other words everything that cannot properly be 
described as state, power, politics, and bureaucracy. 
  2. As a form of existence for a bourgeois 
(market-democratic) society. 
  We support the first approach. 
  Civil society is a systemic element of a single metasystem 
(socium). It is that part of society which stands outside 
political authority, upholds primarily private interests, and 
guarantees the inviolability of private life. 
  Civil society and the state are two sides of one and 
the same coin. They complement one another. 
  Civil society includes: 
  -- voluntarily and spontaneously formed primary 
self-governing communities of people (family, cooperatives, 
associations, economic corporations, public organizations, and 
professional, creative, sports, ethnic, confessional, and other 
associations); 
  -- the totality of nonstate (nonpolitical) economic, social, 
spiritual, moral, and other public relations; 
  -- the productive and private lives of people, their 
customs, 
traditions, and morals; 
  -- the sphere of self-government of free individuals and 
their organizations, protected by the law against direct 
interference therein by state power and politics. 
  It is the civil society that destroys the statesmen's 
monopoly on power and balances state power with the power of 
private individuals and independent organizations. 
  A highly developed civil society in many advanced 
countries has ensured considerable protection of the 
private spheres of man's life against rigid regulation by the 
state. For this purpose, powerful protective associations 
have been formed within its structure (societies for the 
protection of human rights, societies for the protection of 
consumers, and so on). 
  Citizens of countries where a civil society has formed very 
rarely come in contact with their state. In the rest of the 
world, the population is forced into constant contact with it: 
The state constantly regulates something, it allows or bans 
things, even including people's place of residence and work, 
travel for leisure or education purposes, the acquisition of 
goods, and so on. 
  Following the October Revolution and the first steps in the 
implementation of the New Economic Policy [in 1921], our society 
adopted a line toward affirming geunine social protection for 
our working people. Generally speaking, despite all the 
complexities and deformities of subsequent development, these 
principles had a beneficial effect on our life. But left-wing 
orientations prevailed soon afterwards; a military-bureaucratic 
state was established in practice and the upper hand was gained 
by administrative power methods of government, bringing forth a 
series of phenomena alien to a civil society: global 
statization of economic and social life, mass repressions, and 
working people's alienation from ownership, the results of their 
labor, and political power. Virtually all citizens' association 
which were not approved by the top were destroyed, banned, and 
driven underground already by the late 1920's. This resulted in 
undermining the economic and social foundation of the civil 
society's vital activity and in destroying its social sphere, 
thus leading to serious stagnation. But totalitarianism failed 
to completely destroy all the institutions of civil society. 
Some of its structures proved amazingly durable and adaptable. 
  We have to form a civil society as a ramified network 
of social relations and institutions independent of the 
state, expressing the will and protecting the interests of 
citizens. Bearing in mind the population's low standard of civil 
culture and the bureaucracy's resistance, this process will be 
extremely protracted and very painful. 
  These are the conditions of a civil society's vital 
activity: 
  -- all its members must own specific property and 
the right to utilize it and dispose of it as they see fit. 
Thus, the foundation could be provided by privatization, which 
will lead to the creation of self-organizing structures of small 
and medium businesses independent of the state; 
  -- the existence of a developed and rich social 
structure, reflecting the diversity of the interests of 
different groups and strata. Life has confirmed that 
poverty and an undeveloped social structure have always provided 
a breeding ground for dictatorial regimes. 
  The social base of a civil society is the so-called middle 
stratum (middle class). It includes scientific, 
engineering-technical, management, and administrative personnel 
(not holding top administrative positions); salaried 
intelligentsia; urban and rural small owners (farmers); highly 
skilled workers; and some workers from the services sphere. The 
middle stratum in developed countries comprises 60-70 percent of 
the population. It is the middle stratum which not only ensures 
scientific and technical progress but also imparts economic and 
political stability to society; 
  -- sufficiently high level of development of 
individuals themselves, their inner freedom, and the ability to 
participate in the civil society's institutions. 
  Civil society is a self-organizing and self-developing 
system. Society itself will, to a large extent, create favorable 
conditions for it either through the state or despite 
it. Through the state -- via the adoption of necessary 
laws, the formation of democratic state structures, and the 
strict observance of universally accepted democratic norms and 
procedures by the state. This requires a strong state power. 
In the majority of European countries, civil society 
emerged in the conditions of authoritarian regimes actively 
supporting the institutions of civil society. 
  Its development can also occur despite the state -- through 
the formation of counterweights within the Constitution's 
framework, taking the form of independent associations and mass 
media and of oppositionist public democratic movements. By 
creating institutions of self-government, civil society also 
takes on a series of state functions, which could promote 
stabilization in our country. 
  The building of a democratic society presupposes the 
narrowing of the sphere of state regulation of citizens' vital 
activity, rather than the opposite. 
  Civil society is the supreme stage and most modern form of 
human community. Progress is associated with the withering away 
of the state, with its being absorbed within a civil society. 
<H6>  6. The Status of Crime and Russia's Security </H6>
  It is no accident that these two ideas have been juxtaposed. 
For a long time the concept of the struggle against crime in the 
country was officially built upon the "withering away" of 
criminal phenomena during the process of socialist and communist 
building. The struggle against it was assigned mainly to law 
enforcement organs, in other words it was based on repressive 
criminal law methods. The prevention of crime, which was 
discussed at such length, was never properly launched. This 
soft approach toward crime as a phenomenon without any deep 
economic and sociopolitical roots only drove the problem deeper. 
  The law enforcement organs were forced to manipulate 
statistics by artificially inflating or deflating the real 
indicators. 
  Crime in Russia reached an unprecedent scale in 1992. About 
2.8 million crimes were committed, and this figure included a 
more than 40-percent rise in the number of premeditated murders 
and an increase in the number of assaults and robberies by a 
factor of 1.6. The number of crimes per 100,000 members of the 
population increased from 1,467 to 1,857, in other words an 
increase by virtually one-third. 
  This trend persisted also in 1993, but the number of 
recorded crimes hardly reflects the true picture. 
According to some experts' estimates, recently there have been 
some 10-12 million crimes committed in Russia each year. The 
statistics do not include 80 percent of embezzlement cases, 90 
percent of fraud cases, and the overwhelming number of rape 
cases. 
  Some 352,000 persons have been killed or maimed by criminals 
during the last four years. More than 172,000 persons have been 
killed in road traffic accidents and fires. These figures 
are comparable only with war casualties. 
  The criminal world is becoming more professional and is 
acquiring modern technology and weapons. 
  The rising crime poses a real threat to national 
security and the policy of implementation of reforms. 
  It is perfectly obvious that crime, like a mirror, reflects 
the general condition of our society and primarily of its 
foundation -- the economy. Organized crime is 
becoming a special danger for society in the period of political 
and economic changes in the country. The Russian mafia is 
becoming more cruel and more brazen than its counterpart abroad. 
  More than 4,000 origanized criminal communities have been 
exposed in Russia, including over 1,000 with international and 
interregional links. One out of every four groups is protected 
by corrupt functionaries in different structures. According to 
experts' estimates, these relations involve up to 40 percent of 
entrrepreneurs and two-thirds of all commercial structures. So 
far the efforts to combat this growing threat have failed to 
produce any tangible results. 
  This threat has not even been legislatively defined. 
Therefore, we feel that the best possible definition is 
contained in the UN secretary general's report: 
  a) organized crime is the activity of associations or 
criminal individuals or groupings united on an economic basis. 
These groupings are highly reminiscent of gangs during the 
feudal era, which existed in medieval Europe prior to the 
emergence of the state. Economic benefits are gained by the 
supply of illegal services and goods, or of legal services and 
goods using illegal methods; 
  b) organized crime presupposes conspiratorial criminal 
activity, an hierarchy of structures, and coordination of the 
planning and execution of illegal acts; 
  c) organized criminal groupings strive to establish a 
monopoly or an almost complete monopoly on the supply of illegal 
goods and services to consumers; 
  d) organized crime is not limited just to pursuit of 
obviously illegal activity or the supply of illegal services. 
It also includes sophisticated types of activity like money 
laundering via legitimate economic structures and manipulations 
effected with the help of electronic means. Illegal criminal 
groupings infiltrate many profitable legitimate types of 
activity; 
  e) the criminals organized within groupings use cruel 
methods 
like threats, violence, and corruption. These methods can be 
either sophisticated and refined or, conversely, gross, direct, 
and blatant. They are used to gain economic benefit through the 
establishment of monopoly on the supply of illegal goods and 
services or by infiltrating legitimate types of activity and 
corrupting officials. Thus, whenever persons involved in 
organized criminal activity start engaging in legitimate 
commercial activity, they normally bring into it the methods of 
violence and intimidation. 
  There is an expansion of criminal organizations in Russia, 
and this is preconditioned primarily by the growth of 
sociopolitical instability and the weakening of state structures 
in the country at a time when the new democratic institutions 
are still weak. 
  The new categories of criminal activity include: 
  -- the illegal sale of weapons in conditions of instability 
both in Russia and in nearby foreign countries. The volume of 
illegal weapons sales has increased also as a result of ethnic 
and nationalist outbursts (Northern Caucasus, Georgia, 
Azerbaijan, Tajikistan); 
  -- the theft of and trade in stolen cars; 
  -- the theft of cargoes carried by railroad and motor 
vehicle transport; 
  -- the embezzlement and illegal exportation of historical 
and cultural valuables; 
  -- crimes committed with the help of electronic means; 
  -- fraud associated with credit cards and other financial 
documents; 
  -- the illegal disposal of dangerous waste; 
  -- the trade in human organs; 
  -- the "laundering" of illegally earned money; 
  -- the embezzlement and illegal exportation of raw 
materials, energy sources, and rare-earth and nonferrous metals; 
  -- the large-scale production of and trade in drugs; 
  -- insurance frauds; 
  -- money forgery; 
  -- smuggling; 
  -- fraudulent bankruptcies. 
  According to experts' estimates, the illegal circulation of 
drugs in the country amounts to 50-60 billion rubles a year, 
while more than 1.5 million Russian citizens regularly use drugs 
for nonmedical purposes. 
  An intensive process of fusing general criminal activity and 
economic crimes, drugs trafficking, and corruption is under way 
in the country. 
  There is no doubt that the negative effect of organized 
crime 
on our society is growing and affecting all its 
structures at individual, collective, and state levels, being a 
cynical form of lawlessness which maliciously violates citizens' 
rights and constitutional guarantees. 
  In this context, a special danger is posed by corruption and 
its consequences. The taking of illegal advantage of state 
office to gain personal benefit is a "breeding ground" for 
criminal groupings whose leaders consider the payment of sundry 
bribes to officials as one form of investing their funds. 
  We have at present a fine-tuned system of bribery in the 
credit-finance sphere, the trade network, transportation, and 
the organs engaged in foreign economic activity, licensing, and 
privatization. Going bribery rates have been established for 
allocation of land parcels, reregistration of enterprises, 
evasion of military service, assistance in concealing revenue 
from taxation, avoidance of customs regulations with impunity, 
and other illegal operations. Therefore, the corruption of 
officials from law enforcement organs and other state 
institutions engenders among the public profound mistrust 
in the authorities and undermines people's faith in the laws and 
the state. 
  Organized crime is manifesting a growing desire to 
infiltrate 
the country's economy. Arguments have been heard recently 
claiming that the investment of illegally earned funds in the 
legitimate economy would help its stabilization. But this is 
nothing but a myth. World experience shows that organized 
criminal activity destabilizes all economic spheres and disrupts 
the natural effect of market forces. The revenues of organized 
criminal groupings are suffuciently high, but these funds are 
withdrawn from normal circulation. All this gives urgency to 
the elaboration of specific long-term measures to combat 
organized crime. 
  Criminal groupings continue to actively penetrate society's 
social and political life. While pursuing their objectives, 
they are now influencing both election campaigns and the 
legislative processes by corrupting politicians and officials. 
Organized criminal groupings are also trying to extend their 
influence on the mass media. Thus, a process of organized 
crime's evolution into an antisocial system claiming leadership 
in the economy and in politics is now under way in Russia. 
<H6>  Some Conclusions </H6>
  The unchecked spread of crime in our country is a 
consequence of the overall weakening of the state and its power 
structures. The solution of this problem is a 
statewide task, whereby the actual plan of struggle against 
crime must become part of a program for strengthening and 
developing the Russian state, based on nationwide accord. 
  Of course, the specific activity to curb and uproot crime 
must be conducted and improved in parallel with all measures to 
strengthen Russian statehood, but must be implemented much 
faster and more efficiently. 
  There must be no delay in elaborating and implementing this 
plan. The present conditions in Russia and the CIS countries 
are creating a situation which is unique in human history and 
typical only of the former USSR republics in the light of the 
specific economic and political aspects of their history, the 
contemporary period of transition, and the future prospects. 
Organized crime and corruption are most dangerous by dint of 
their destructive long-term consequences for the individual, 
society, and the state. 
  The accumulation of vast wealth by individuals and clans in 
the world of organized crime inevitably leads to the need to 
politically protect their interests. Hence the 
desire to control power in the state, bribe 
high-ranking officials, and promote the recipients of bribes to 
higher positions. 
  Russia and the CIS countries are experiencing a 
multiplication of established criminal communities which either 
have, or are in the process of establishing, a financial base 
for the attainment of their goals, major arsenals of weapons, 
hierarchical structures, far-reaching conspiracy, and rigid 
discipline with vertical subordination and the use of terror, 
even including the physical elmination of people. 
  Organized crime, relying on general criminal activity and 
corruption, is beginning to permeate all cells of society and 
the state organism, extending to vitally important centers and 
spheres: the economy, finance, science and technology, culture, 
the Armed Forces, and so on. Therefore, the plan for struggle 
against crime must be specifically geared without 
overlooking a single one of these spheres. 
  Organized crime recognizes no borders. It is increasingly 
becoming not only interregional but also transnational, and 
therefore the struggle against it requires the pooling of the 
world community's efforts. 
  The primary task is to create a firm legislative basis, 
enforce respect for the law, and ensure the law's implementation 
by all citizens, social associations, and state structures -- 
primarily by the law enforcement organs themselves. For 
this purpose it is necessary to adopt the most radical 
measures, even though they may be unpopular. Russians will 
support them if they perceive that this is not just another 
campaign but a state policy which really ensures the 
security of the individual and society. 
<H3>  Section II: II. Formation of Genuine Spiritual Principles 
and Values of the Russian People </H3>
<H6>  1. Need for a National Idea </H6>
  During the most critical periods of our fatherland's 
history, 
the nation has been saved thanks to the vast reserves of the 
Russian people's spiritual strength. A most important role here 
is played by the Russian idea. 
  The Russian idea comprises primarily Orthodox spirituality 
which is distinguished by its refusal to rationalize faith and 
its acceptance of God with the soul, with love, and with a 
selfless perception of beauty. It is underpinned by the concept 
of conciliarism [sobornost] as the unification of 
people for the sake of the Orthodox faith's revival and the 
fatherland's prosperity. 
  The Russian people's commitment to the idea of 
statehood is historically established. Only the moral 
authority of state power is capable of containing the anarchic 
quests for the kingdom of truth within the confines of the 
evolutionary path. 
  Another key aspect of the Russian idea is the 
universality of the Russian national character, in other 
words its tolerance for and acceptance of other ideas and 
traditions, its ability to coexist with neighboring peoples. In 
all probability, this quality is exploited, more than any other, 
by those who would like to dilute the universal love for one's 
neighbor into abstract universal human values. 
  There has been a long pressing need to start talking about 
statehood on a state level. By dint of its unique 
geopolitical situation, Russia has an opportunity to take its 
proper position in the community of the 21st century and turn 
into a really highly developed world power. One of the mistakes 
of our government, the president, and his entourage is the fact 
that they hardly ever discuss this with the people. The 
nation must regain its dignity, clearly perceive its 
historic prospects, and acquire confidence in its future and its 
own strength. 
  It is necessary for the idea of statehood to become state 
ideology and political practice and, ultimately, state policy. 
All citizens, state institutions, and branches of power 
must support the idea of statehood by all possible means. 
  The great Russian philosopher Vl. Solovyev emphasized: 
"Individual human beings and entire nations alike face the task 
of complementing each other without losing their originality 
but, on the contrary, expressing it to the utmost. The true 
unity of peoples is not homogeneity but pannational spirit, in 
other words interaction and solidarity by all for autonomous and 
full life by all." 
  These are truly sacred words, calling for unity. Everything 
that has happened over the last few years is at times 
reminiscent of the flight of troops, abandoning behind them to 
the vagaries of fate 25 million captives -- Russians and 
Russian-speaking compatriots who have suddenly found themselves 
in alien countries nowadays dubbed nearby foreign countries. 
  Now, drawing parallels with the USSR, Russia itself is 
already "at breaking point." The question of its integrity and 
its future faces us with utmost urgency. 
  There are quite a few "time bombs" along the path which 
Russia has taken. The unequal status of peoples without their 
own statehood, and primarily the Russian people. The 
centrifugal tendencies stemming from the national-economic 
separatism of some Federation components. The growth of 
religious-nationalist separatism. Administrative borders are 
being reshaped at the will of irresponsible politicians and are 
acquiring the status of state borders, which history and the 
peoples will hardly accept. 
  Scientists and politicians pondering these problems today 
single out several paths and several models of development. 
They include dictatorship on an imperial scale, the emergence 
of numerous "ethnojuntas" and enclaves, spontaneous or 
artificially provoked outburst of Russian nationalism leading to 
the revival of unity by force and uprooting all separatist 
tendencies, military intervention by other states, artificial 
creation of a separate "Russian Republic," and enforced 
colonization of the etnnic groups and nations inhabiting the 
country's territory. And yet, some time ago, the Russian 
thinker I. Ilin warned: "Those who would dismember 
Russia...dream that, after the bolsheviks' fall, the citizens of 
united Russia will again slide into chaos and anarchy, will 
decompose their state with impunity...and, with total disregard 
for everything, will set up as many new `statelets' as they 
fancy, each one of these new formations having its own army, 
currency, and diplomacy.... This is why they want to see the 
`Russian national groups' discarding the existence of a single 
Russian people and state and, taking advantage of the 
postbolshevik chaos, bringing about universal arbitrariness and 
collapse..., they dream of turning Russia into a multiplicity of 
pitiful and strategically impotent pigmies -- thus leaving it 
open to conquest and enslavement by western and southeastern 
states." 
  The guiding idea of "pannational spirit" -- unifying, 
reconciling extremes along Russian lines, and creating 
conditions for peaceful democratic development -- can lead to 
Russia's deliverance, revival, and future prosperity. 
  One of the main obstacles, in our view, is the fact that 
today's national-state structure of the Russian Federation does 
not guarantee the rights of different nationalities and does not 
promote the preservation of the state's integrity. Not all 
Federation components enjoy equal state-legal status. Some 100 
nationalities living in Russia still have an undefined status. 
  Both national experience -- the Russian Empire and the 
Soviet 
Union (despite all past mistakes and shortcomings of 
nationalities policy, this historical experience contains much 
that is positive), and international experience -- China, the 
United States, and Switzerland, offer much that is of interest 
in matter of state building. "All men are born free and equal 
in status and rights," according to the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. Each person must enjoy all rights and freedoms 
regardless of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or 
other beliefs, national or social origin, and class or other 
status. This should be the basis when forming the structures of 
a state system guaranteeing equality for all Russians. 
  A breakup of the Russian ethnos is now under way, or rather 
its violent split, with the formation in former Union and 
autonomous republics of Russian national minorities, at times 
accounting for up to 50 percent of the population, and this in 
itself is already fraught with catastroiphic conflicts. Any 
attempts to concentrate in Russian communities the millions of 
people who have ended up as refugees in their own country or as 
the hostages of ambitious politicians, would have virtually the 
same result. Abandoned homes and hearths, migration of the work 
force which would be fatal for the national economies, grief and 
death for people. The years of labor by tens of millions of 
people are being erased as a result of the repartition of ethnic 
habitats. 
  Russian people, regardless of where they live and provided 
their national awareness is maintained, are the driving force of 
Russia's revival. The state strategy of the Russian great 
power must be based on the historical and spiritual heritage of 
its people. Russia will never be revived unless the world 
outlook and national awareness typical of our people are 
recreated. 
<H6>  2. The Role of Science. Russia's Scientific and Technical 
Priorities </H6>
  The strategy of national security must take into account, as 
some of its most important priorities, the development of 
culture, science, and education as the foundations of the 
nation's development and spirituality. 
  History has proved that, thanks to scientific and technical 
progress, efficient socioeconomic growth has been graphically 
achieved by states with the most diverse social systems, 
territorial size, and reserves of natural and labor resources. 
  Virtually all industrial countries actively finance the 
institutions of national science, whether administered by state 
ministries and departments or the private sector. They 
create powerful centers for the gathering, processing, analysis, 
and dissemination of scientific information. They participate 
in capital construction and the outfitting of research centers 
and laboratories with modern equipment, reagents, and 
instruments. In the United States, for example, the 
federal government finances about 50 percent of the national 
total of expenditure on all scientific research and development 
and about 80 percent of the national total of fundamental 
scientific research. 
  The most important factor is the desire to enhance the 
science-intensiveness of the national product. The dynamics of 
prices in the civilized world market unambiguously proves the 
advantages of marketing the products of science-intensive 
sectors. 
  The state is aware of the priority of scientific and 
technical progress also as regards the fast pace of development 
of the "military branch" of the global scientific and technical 
revolution. Both today and in the future the state's defense 
capability will be determined by the qualitative parameters of 
arms and military equipment. 
  Today's world is on the verge of a new stage of the 
scientific and technical revolution, which will be distinguished 
by an even greater wealth of information. As competition forces 
the economies of advanced countries into an accelerated 
development of science-intensive sectors, the latter will 
increasingly supplant sectors based on the utilization of 
unskilled labor and energy- and materials-intensive production 
units. They require vast quantities of raw materials to ensure 
that their plants do not shut down -- iron, steel, cement, 
timber, oil products, and so on. They are the main sources of 
pollution and other ecological problems on the planet. 
Furthermore, they need markets for the export of mass 
production output. 
  The economies of "third generation" countries will depend to 
an incalculable degree on the availability of territory suitable 
for agricultural production. In contrast with the 
"industrialized countries," they will not be so strongly 
dependent on their own sources of energy and foodstuffs. What 
they will need first and foremost will be knowledge -- the 
actual "hard currency" of the era of the scientific and 
technical revolution. These countries will need access to and 
control of data banks and telecommunications networks. They 
need markets for commodities and services, management 
consultancies, computer programs, and financial and economic 
statistics. There will also be a need for reliable protection 
against piracy of intellectual property. 
  The main objective of Russia's scientific and technical 
policy is to ensure conditions, commensurate with the country's 
geopolitical and economic status, which would guarantee the 
fullest possible utilization of already accumulated scientific 
potential and its further growth in the interests of the 
development of the country's economy, its foreign policy 
positions, and its defense capability. 
  Social calamities have not bypassed the sphere of science, 
either. This is indicated primarily by the decline of its 
national-state prestige and the sharp cutbacks in finance for 
it. Expenditure on science has been reduced from 5.1 percent of 
national income in 1991 to 3.1 percent in 1993. 
  Is this accidental? 
  Its development has been mainly determined by the state's 
political stipulations. Science in the USSR has not always been 
a direct productive force, but it did remain a factor of 
national prestige until just a few years ago. It was not 
customary in this sphere to consider expenses and take account 
of losses when performing state tasks, such as creating a 
powerful research and experimental base for nuclear physics, 
developing ICBM's, and exploring space. 
  Financial cutbacks in 1990 showed that the state was no 
longer capable of playing the role of a generous patron. There 
is a real danger of ruin for many famous scientific schools, 
creative collectives, and important scientific avenues which are 
a matter of national and worldwide pride. 
  At the same time, there has been a sharp deterioration in 
the 
already inadequate provision of material and technical backup 
for science. In this regard we have always lagged behind 
industrially developed countries and, while science in the West 
was retooling, the lag from which we suffered has turned into a 
gap which is difficult to close. By the late 1980's the 
fixed assets of science represented less than 2 percent of the 
national economy's fixed assets. The gap between the level 
of the material, technical, and information base and the tasks 
of modern science is one of the most substantial factors of the 
general crisis in Russia's science. 
  The economic decline in 1991-1993 has virtually 
eliminated our country's instrument making -- it has proved 
to be unprofitable. There is no foreign currency to purchase 
imported instruments. The information backup for science can be 
said to be at almost zero-level, and Russia's scientists appear 
to be cut off from the world's data banks. More than 
two-thirds of polled leaders and associates of leading academic 
institutes in Moscow believe that the situation in this sphere 
is catastrophic. The mothballing of the existing material and 
technical base cannot be ruled out in the immediate future. 
Here we have reached a "lag threshold" beyond which any 
realistic activity within the framework of the world's 
scientific system would become problematic and even impossible 
along many avenues. 
  The numerical strength of specialists engaged in research 
work in the sectors of science and scientific services declined 
by approximately 12 percent in 1991 alone. The scientists' 
labor has been devalued. By the end of 1992, for example, their 
salaries were 30 percent less than the average in the national 
economy. According to Goskomstat [State Committee for 
Statistics] data, the "Science and Scientific Services" sector 
ranks only 11th out of the 13 basic national economic 
sectors. The situation has changed somewhat recently, but 
is far from stable. 
  Public opinion did not shift in the scientists' favor, 
either. The bulk of the population has always perceived them as 
social parasites. The situation was aggravated by the wholesale 
recruitment of scientific workers by the government apparatus 
and sundry commissions and committees. 
  All this prompted scientists to leave the confines of their 
laboratories and even the state's borders. The average monthly 
number of cadres leaving the sectors of science and scientific 
services in 1991-1992 was double the number of new recruits. 
Postgraduate study has lost its prestige. 
  According to Russian MVD Visas and Registrations 
Administration data, taking into account only people who have 
emigrated on a permanent basis, 4,572 persons engaged in science 
and national education emigrated from the country in 1992 (7.8 
percent of the total number of emigrating ablebodied adults). 
The ones who are leaving are, as a rule, either already 
established persons or the young and most promising ones. The 
youngest generation in Russian science will soon end up being a 
generation of 40-year olds. Using UN methodology, it has been 
calculated that the losses which Russia will incur as a result 
of the brain drain will amount to $60-70 billion a year. 
  The development of Russia's statehood, economy, and 
society is inseparably linked with and, moreover, unimaginable 
without, the development of science. Given a sensible 
utilization of its potential, it is capable of enriching society 
and the state. But: Science in Russia, having taken the path of 
re-forming, was from the very beginning excluded from the number 
of spheres on which the top leadership and authorities at all 
levels focused their attention. The situation has also changed 
in the military-political sphere: The authorities' interest in 
the defense sector, including its fundamental basis -- defense 
science which is nurturing many fields of knowledge -- has 
significantly declined. 
  International experts recently drew the following 
conclusion: 
Russia's scientific potential represents its 
second-largest national asset after its natural resources. 
  The scientific prestige and creative potential of academic 
colectives engaged in fundamental reesearch were created by many 
generations. We have no right to squander this capital. 
  Its is clear that a natural integration is needed in the new 
economic conditions. We ought to concentrate on the 
assimilation of academic elaborations in the applied science 
sphere and provide various work and services of a scientific and 
scientific-technical nature helping the implementation of major 
projects. There is demand for highly professional expert 
evaluation of projects and elaborations, as well as for the 
development and utilization of training and information centers 
for the training and retraining of scientific cadres. Life has 
proved that many research workers are only vaguely aware of the 
key problems of the market -- its requirements, the conditions 
of competitive struggle, questions of profitability, and so on. 
  Sectoral science, covering almost 70 percent of Russia's 
entire research infrastructure, has firmly embarked on market 
relations. But it has also suffered serious blows inflicted by 
market elements. The USSR Law on the State Enterprise, which 
also extended to sectoral scientific and technical 
organizations, failed to take into account the fundamental 
differences between the process of creating scientific-technical 
output and the process of creating industrial output. 
Unfortunately, Russian legislation extended this tradition. 
  OECD experts offer radical methods: It is necessary to cut 
the number of persons employed in science and scientific 
services in Russia by two-thirds, to the level of 300,000, at 
the expense of sectoral science. Is this not a mechanistic 
approach? 
  There is also the inarguable conclusion that sectoral 
science 
is overweighted in favor of the defense, space, nuclear, and 
machine building complexes. The conversion now under way will 
actually solve this problem by gearing science in the defense 
sectors to civilian needs. Of course, there is a far from 
inarguable claim that the output of this complex is currently 
unsuitable for market conditions. On the contrary, we are 
obviously unwillingly -- due to fear from competition -- allowed 
to take advanced technologies to the world market where there is 
considerable demand for them. This is the essence of the Western 
"recommendations." 
  It is well known that the most significant discoveries in 
science occur at the juncture of its different sectors. It 
seems that the quest for the best possible organizational 
structures in science during its transition to a market economy 
must also be nurtured by ideas from both flanks -- science and 
production. Any unilateral organizational and economic 
transformations are fraught with the loss of scientific 
potential. 
  Privatization in science is also necessary. But, as 
specialists assume, it must be regulated by the provisions of a 
special program based on general principles but also taking into 
account the specific features of scientific activity and geared 
to the efficient reorganization of the sphere of research work. 
  At present more than 45 percent of the network of 
organizations engaged in scientific research and development in 
Russia are situated on the territory of nine regions. These are 
the city of Moscow and Moscow Oblast; the city of St. Petersburg 
and Leningrad Oblast; Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk, Rostov, and 
Nizhniy Novgorod Oblasts; and the Republic of Bashkortostan. 
  Unfortunately, until the last few years, Russia lacked a 
regional scientific policy. The main point here is to avoid 
going to extremes: Shifting all responsibilities for its 
implementation either to the center or to local authorities, 
either of which will lead to undesirable consequences in the 
development of both science and the regions. 
  It is necessary to show concern for the future of closed 
science cities like Arzamas-16. Having a unique scientific and 
technical potential at their disposal, science cities could 
become centers for the development of new knowledge, 
technologies, and modern education, conduits for technical 
innovations in all spheres of the national economy, and the 
basis for the development of state scientific centers and the 
conversion of industrial production units. 
  The draft working program of the Russian Federation Council 
of Ministers-Government for 1993-1995 "Development of Reforms 
and Stabilization of Russia's Economy" contains numerous 
provisions addressing science. This is promising. It is, of 
course, important to ensure that plans do not remain just good 
intentions. Much will depend on the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Science and Technology Policy, which has been given extensive 
powers. 
  In accordance with strategic objectives, Russia's 
scientific and technical policy ought to be formulated by the 
legislative organs and adopted as an unconditional priority by 
the country's government. 
  This will require: 
  -- That specialized committees (commissions) for problems of 
the country's scientific and technical development be created in 
the legislative chambers of Russia's future parliament, 
assigning to them, among other tasks, the preparation of regular 
analytical reviews for the elaboration of appropriate 
legislative acts. 
  -- That the government's statistical records organs are 
obliged by appropriate decisions by the chambers of Russia's 
parliament to publish statistical material on the country's 
economy, including the collection and analysis of statistical 
data on the numerical strength of the contingents of scientific 
cadres, the amounts of state budget financing and other sources 
of finance for our country's science for the practical 
attainment of the strategic goals of scientific and technical 
development. 
  -- That Russia's government eliminates the prevailing 
imbalances in the remuneration of scientific and other workers 
in the country. 
  -- That funds are ensured for the financing of state 
budget-financed scientific research organizations at the level 
necessary to maintain their productivity. 
  -- That in 1994 the country's organs of legislative and 
executive power find methods and means to prevent any 
further decline of the science-intensiveness potential of 
Russia's national product and ensure preferential development 
for our country's science. 
  -- That Russia's government ensures state budget financing 
for the country's science in 1994 at a level of at least 
2.3-2.5 percent of the country's GNP and ensures conditions for 
further raising this indicator in the next few years. That 
the decline of the proportion of scientific associates among the 
other categories of hired workers employed by state organization 
be halted. 
  -- Without excessively diminishing the importance of broad 
international cooperation, it is necessary to create all 
conditions (salaries, equipment, libraries) to ensure that 
our scientists work effectively in their own country. 
<H6>  3. Guidelines for Politicians in the Education Sphere </H6>
  The Russian mathematician Nikolay Ivanovich Lobachevskiy, 
while holding the post of rector of Kazan University, frequently 
addressed students with speeches about man's purpose and his 
creative potential. Man, he emphasized, "was born to be master, 
conqueror, and king of nature. But the wisdom with which he 
ought to rule from the throne he has inherited is not given to 
him by birth; it is acquired by study." Lobachevskiy was a 
confirmed advocate of the development of all gifts of the 
individual in the process of training and education. Only thus 
will man develop as an individual and will expand the horizons 
of his intellectual might. 
  The scientific and technical progress influences not only 
equipment and technology. It promotes the headlong progress of 
productive forces as a whole and man's development, it demands 
comprehensive and complete utilization of man's abilities which 
is impossible to achieve without improving education. 
  Spiritual and intellectual perfection are not automatically 
acquired. Britain has the Open University with 250 branches, 
Germany has the Westphalian Correspondence University, Japan has 
the Radio University, Israel has the Everyman University, and so 
on. It is time for Russia to seriously tackle the radical 
renewal of the entire reserve of knowledge and intellectual 
potential. 
  Our society's reform must presuppose a fundamental reform of 
the education system, beginning with the objectives of 
education, its economic foundation, and the management of the 
education system, and ending with the system for training and 
retraining of specialists, the schools structure, and the 
content and technology of training. 
  The development of modern society is determined mainly by 
the 
scientific and technical revolution. This takes the form of the 
vast flow of information, the rapidly changing production 
technologies, and the equally rapid obsolescence of the 
knowledge and habits of specialists at almost all levels. Any 
country's position in the world community is directly associated 
with its achievements in the elaboration of qualitatively new 
technologies and activity systems. Autonomous thought and 
the ability to make decisions are irreversibly demanded of each 
member of society. Today's mass schooling is in principle 
not geared to the cultivation of these qualities in individuals. 
  The utilitarianism which dominates society has resulted in a 
considerable dehumanization of culture and has destroyed many 
spiritual values, offering almost nothing in exchange. The 
traditions underlying the formation of previous generations' 
spiritual world and the ability to reproduce the people's 
culture have been either largely broken or altogether lost. 
  Today, following the loss of the time link and the world's 
integrity as necessary conditions for culture's reproduction and 
development, the school's most important task is to 
restore continuity between generations and implant in the school 
pupils' minds the historical roots linking them with the past 
history of their own people and the whole of mankind. 
  Unfortunately, over the last few years the prestige of 
secondary education has fallen to its lowest level ever in 20th 
century history. Polls in 1993 showed that only 20 percent are 
fully satisfied with the standards of education, 70 percent of 
teachers and parents believe that schools are in the deepest of 
crises, 50 percent of teachers are not satisfied with their own 
training and work, and 85 percent of young specialists believe 
that the education they have acquired is not in line with the 
latest achievements of science. The following are identified as 
some of the causes of the crisis in schools: the surplus 
principle for finance and material backup, the declining value 
of education, the weakening of discipline and law and order in 
the country, bureaucracy in the management of education, and the 
low standing of teaching as a profession. 
  The situation in higher education is equally 
complex, even though selfless and knowledgeable 
professionals are working there. Thanks to their heroic efforts, 
the decline has been halted to some degree. The edict "On 
Measures To Support State VUZ's [higher educational 
institutions]" has been signed, giving them land for indefinite 
free use. 
  Nonetheless, Russia's VUZ's are losing young lecturers, the 
prestige of this profession is declining, and the socioeconomic 
situation of scientific, pedagogical, and research cadres has 
deteriorated. 
  The depth of the crisis in education is determined not by 
the 
state's poverty but by the inability to match the citizens' 
requirements, demands, and wishes with the potential of the 
country's teachers corps and the standards of programs. 
Adequate funding and the replacement of fundamentally old 
schools will not produce quality education. It can be produced 
only by the appropriate content of education, the technology of 
training, and the professional standards of teacher trainers. 
  There is a need for a state strategy for the 
development of education, elaborated in detail. A very 
important step has been taken -- the Law on Education has been 
adopted. This law has emancipated and deideologized the 
schools. But it is still in our schools that we are less 
prepared for freedom and creativity than in any other sector of 
production, science, and culture. 
  Work must be done along two avenues: scientific 
substantiation of all fundamental provisions of reform and 
elaboration of appropriate legislation. 
  The centralized financing of schools from the state budget 
has become an objective hindrance to their development. Of 
course, even now part of the expenditure should be borne by the 
state budget. This applies primarily to capital construction. 
The other part should be covered by municipal funds. Russia 
does have such experience. It ought to be revived in the law on 
local self-government. A great role in the financing of schools 
can be played by local education funds and school supervisory 
councils, provided a sensible system of tax benefits is 
elaborated. 
  Fundamental changes are also necessary in the management of 
the education system. Many relevant provisions have been made 
in the Law on Education. There is a need to considerably 
reduce the management apparatus and to fundamentally change its 
functions. 
  Hitherto all changes in the management system have been 
implemented by management officials themselves and in their own 
interests. The total number of managers per pupil has been 
steadily growing. The new management system must be structured 
for the children's benefit, with a view to their more 
comfortable life and best possible development. 
  Schools must become fully autonomous in all regards and must 
be fully responsible for the quality of children's training and 
education. The quality of training could be monitored by 
supervisory councils using tests which determine whether 
knowledge and habits are in line with state standards. This 
will enable schools to become a self-regulating system, with 
self-development providing the basis for the mechanism of their 
functioning. In these conditions, schools will begin to 
actively form the best possible infrastructure and educational 
environment for their pupils. 
  Without putting matters off until the more distant future, 
resolute steps ought to be taken already in 1994-1995 toward a 
more efficient utilization of higher education's educational and 
scientific potential and an expansion of already existing forms 
of integration between science and higher education. This means 
fundamentally new forms of mutual relations between science and 
VUZ's -- the creation of scientific education complexes, the 
preparation of joint scientific programs and projects, and the 
training of pupils for schools and VUZ's. 
  Transformations in schools -- both general educational 
and higher educational -- must be geared to the awakening of 
cognitive activity in each individual and to teaching him how to 
acquire knowledge autonomously. 
<H6>  4. Culture in Russia </H6>
  It can be said that Russia's cultural figures now enjoy more 
creative freedom and political independence than ever before in 
its thousand-year long history. And yet, these figures 
increasingly often proclaim that the last few years have become 
the era of "the country's deculturization," "the denigration of 
talent," and the impoverishment of writers, painters, humanists, 
and museum workers to a level already approaching that of the 
Civil War and Great Patriotic War years. 
  On the other hand, Minister of Culture Ye. Sidorov shocks 
the 
country by announcing that about 80 percent of icons in Russia 
have been exported in the last few years. If truth be said, it 
is hard to imagine who has calculated this, and how, seeing that 
records of cultural assets in the country have always been badly 
kept and nowadays are in a state of total disarray. Book 
publishing statistics in our country are also deceptive, but 
specialists claim -- not altogether groundlessly -- that the 
works of Pushkin, Blok, L. Tolstoy, and Gogol are today 
published in smaller print runs than during the years of 
postrevolutionary devastation or after World War II. Never 
before have so many cultural monuments been destroyed in Russia, 
and it is impossible to imagine that the state budget was "not 
in a position" to appropriate a few million rubles to restore 
the monument on Chekhov's grave at Novodevichye Cemetery, which 
is today badly in need of repair. 
  A multitude of people -- from the president down to the 
merchants specializing in the marketing of folk art and craft 
products -- assure Russia of respect for the originality of 
national culture. But television's weekly popular education 
programs abound exclusively with foreign titles. 
  A "top level" decision has been made in Russia to elaborate 
a 
program for the privatization of culture and art institutions 
(theaters, museums, buildings, country estates), taking into 
account the interests of the legitimate heirs of their former 
owners. And yet that selfsame document "decrees" a ban on any 
privatization whatsoever in the cultural sphere. The president 
has prescribed a policy of returning to the church all buildings 
and other valuables originally intended for religious purposes. 
He has also promulgated an edict granting the status of 
national cultural monument to a series of especially outstanding 
cultural institutions, which would render inviolable the 
collection of, for example, the Tretyakov Gallery which owns a 
huge collection of icons, or the Russian State Library with its 
unique collection of religious books and manuscripts.... 
  There is a vast multitude of similar contradictions in plans 
and actions, and it is increasingly difficult to answer the 
question: What has happened and what is happening to Russia's 
cultural policy, and is there any cultural policy at 
all? 
  Our country has already crossed the line marking the start 
of 
an era of historical ruin, comparable in scale with the 
Tatar-Mongol invasion. The "culture problem" is far broader 
than the problem of the present political power, of economic 
reform, and of state reorganization: The nation must find the 
strength and methods to comprehend and resolve it regardless of 
what the authorities might do. Especially since culture is more 
viable than all political regimes, ideologies, and states. It 
is a question only of the price and methods of culture's 
self-preservation as a condition for the nation's survival. 
  The questions of preserving the monuments of the Soviet era 
and the cultural heritage of those years as a whole are being 
raised especially urgently (maybe deliberately?) today. But 
no matter what political, economic, social, and any other 
renewal may be yearned for by any country, its desire can be 
satisfied only by reliance on the past. It was said a 
long, long time ago: "They fire at the past and kill the 
future." But the process of "overcoming the past" and "bringing 
the fatherland's culture back to the mainstream of world 
development" soon enough took a "special path" again. This has 
proved to be the path of leveling the fatherland's culture. 
Politics has once again, stealthily and "on the quiet," 
assumed the functions of culture, deciding once again on 
the latter's behalf what from the past is suitable for the 
"civilized society" model and what has to be excised, 
cauterized, and ridiculed. 
  The stormy changes which occurred in our society in the last 
few years did not result in any noticeable creative 
productivity. Spiritual life is flooded with nothing but 
the monotonous flow of previously "forbidden fruit." Literary 
journals are slowly sinking into oblivion. It is not so much 
that viewers are deserting the theater, but that the theater is 
deserting viewers: It has nothing to say. National 
cinematography is in a state of coma. The humanities and social 
sciences are ravaged. Philosophers have been squeezed out by 
chiromancers and sundry other charlatans. 
  The "former Soviet intelligentsia" is increasingly often 
sighing: It was better in the past, they dictated to us but at 
least we got paid. Until quite recently Federico Fellini's 
reflection was considered a bad joke, but now people seem to 
comprehend its meaning: "I fancy the order which caused 
suffering to artists in the past: A pope, a duke, or a viceroy 
commissioned a work and did not feed the artist if the work was 
not completed. Had it not been for those tyrants, we would not 
have enjoyed the hundreds of great works." In actual 
fact, freedom as such does not in any way guarantee the 
flourishing of creativity. Nowadays many people repeat the 
old truism: Poverty is the worst form of slavery. Creative 
people are becoming hostages of commercialism; the naive 
political faith of many intellectuals in politicians has proved 
fatal: How many notable figures are now silent, having been 
traumatized by the fact that they perceived as beacons some 
politicians who proved to be nothing but deceptive 
will-o'-the-wisps. 
  At the same time, in a situation whereby we are more than 
likely not only to experience a buildup of catastrophic tension 
in all spheres of society's life but also to see the people 
driven into apathy and listlessness, right up to the point where 
the desire and actual will to live are dulled and society is 
paralyzed because nothing is sacred and mandatory for people -- 
in this situation we are beginning to see the emergence of a 
stratum of people with the qualities and functions of a new 
intelligentsia. 
  The intelligentsia is not affiliated to any political 
stream, 
it does not serve either the state, or the parties, or the 
church, or even the people. Intelligence as a human 
quality does not speak on anyone's behalf but its own, based on 
the theoretical principles of knowledge. 
  The theoretical nature of the new intelligentsia's judgments 
does not at all mean that it is aloof from the realities of 
life. Now, for example, it cannot adopt an indifferent attitude 
toward the Russian Government. In this regard, the 
intelligentsia does not fit anywhere within the range of 
viewpoints held by various political groups and various social 
strata of the population. From a sounder point of view it can 
be seen that a change of government and of authority in general 
will inevitably result in replacing the immature, inconsistent, 
at times simply foolish and clumsy democracy -- but democracy 
nonetheless -- with a quasi-democracy. This is the ground on 
which intellectuals determine their attitude toward the 
government today. But from the fundamental position, the 
present situation calls more for understanding rather than for 
approval or condemnation. To comprehend and to announce 
its conclusions to society -- this is the function of the new 
intelligentsia. Politicians, intellectuals, parties, and 
movements want success, a member of the intelligentsia wants the 
truth. By its very nature the new intelligentsia needs, more 
than anything else, the fullest possible democracy, and it is 
the one that can utilize it best of all. This means that it is 
capable of being a kind of regulator of the degree and form of 
democracy. 
  The new intelligentsia is also the "bearer" of optimism in a 
society of skepticism and cynicism, of gloom and pessimism. Its 
optimism is based on its ability to perceive the contemporary 
social processes in the context of world problems and their 
history. Any "party approach" evaluates events and their 
consequences in terms of years or decades, while the new 
intelligentsia's supraparty and apolitical approach enables it 
to think in terms of the world and of centuries. The new kind 
of intelligentsia presupposes an independent morality. It 
scorns moral prejudices and the dominant spirit of the time. In 
the conditions of "generally accepted" deceipt and camouflage, 
it is capable of sincerity, of the salutary self-restriction to 
nothing but implacably pointing out any manifestation of 
immorality to others and, in all other instances, imputes to 
dissidents nothing but intellectual confusion. 
  The intelligentsia's morality rules out the most permanent 
disease of intellectuals -- egotism, and it preaches the 
principle: Love not me but mine. 
  At a time when malicious intent, selfishness, and deception 
in actions are becoming an everyday occurrence, the morality of 
a member of the intelligentsia calls for inaction as the last 
means of demonstrating disagreement. 
  This very intelligentsia will become the "third force" 
which, 
in conditions of mass hostility to all parties, programs, and 
everything else that divides and embitters, will mediate in 
relations between the people and the authorities, will 
comprehend and explain their role and limits, and will bring 
about a mutual sensible moderation. We see the role of 
prosecutor being played even by many "generals" of literature, 
the arts, the humanities, and the social sciences who, until 
quite recently, strove to grab a seat on honorary presidiums as 
close as possible to Politburo members, glorified "socialist 
realism," and headed creative unions, scientific research 
institutes, and newspapers and journals. We see such a great 
multitude of cultural figures who had always been "against" not 
only "mentally" but also openly, that it is already hard to 
imagine who was ever "in favor" and who produced the thousands 
of novels, poems, movies, and monographs comprising "the world's 
most advanced socialist culture." 
  For the time being, many of our intellectuals are living 
just 
for the day, carried away by an exaggerated impression of their 
own importance in the fatherland's spiritual ruin. This is what 
the authorities value. But time is passing, and they need 
more and more people capable of building rather than 
destroying. There are very few of them and they, made 
wiser by experience, are trying to keep their distance from the 
authorities. This offers that much more scope for those who are 
diligent in seeking the blessings of the powers that be. But 
any authority's "special treatment" of the "masters of the word" 
has always and everywhere been like a royal court's relations 
with jesters. 
  Russia's geopolitical position is such that it enables it to 
occupy a most befitting niche in the planet's community in the 
21st century -- befitting its people, its culture, and its 
history; it can turn into a really first-rate power. This is 
important for all, because it will guarantee people's stability 
of existence, prosperous life, and opportunity to effectively 
exercise their own intellectual and moral potential. This goal 
is attainable. The nation must be aware of its own dignity, it 
must be confident that it is capable of achieving a lot, that it 
has not been cast on history's scrap heap as some people try to 
imply. This applies to all spheres of human activity, but 
especially to sophisticated instruments of manifesting national 
self-awareness like science, education, and culture. 
<H6>  5. The Growing Role of the Orthodox Church </H6>
  Russian statehood is just one century older than the Russian 
Orthodox Church, if we take as our starting point the date when 
Christianity was adopted as the state religion of Rus by Kievan 
Grand Prince Vladimir in A.D. 988. Nonetheless, it was this 
step that largely promoted the cause of Russian state building. 
  Simultaneously with Christianity, Rus also adopted Byzantine 
Law which had incorporated all the best points of Roman Law 
which had been further fecundated by the Church's conciliarist 
experience over the centuries. The state importance of the 
Church for Rus during the Kievan period of its history was 
largely determined by the fact that, to a considerable extent, 
the Church was also the judiciary. As a matter of fact, right 
until the Conciliar Code was compiled in 1649, church rules 
often filled in the gaps in state laws comprising the princely 
jurisdiction. 
  It is understandable that this great importance of the 
episcopate's judicial power was based primarily on its 
moral authority. During the pre-Mongol period, the 
metropolitan and bishops often had to reconcile princes at times 
of civil strife. Essentially, the Orthodox Church at the 
time played the role of a most important factor of 
national unity. 
  Let us recall that during the sad days of the October (1993) 
crisis, it was the Orthodox Church that again took on this 
historical role. And it is not to blame for the fact that the 
voice of reason was not heeded. 
  It is necessary to dwell on the following fact. Grand Prince 
Ivan Danilovich Kalita of Muscovy invited Metropolitan Petr of 
Kiev and All Rus to settle in his capital. The foundations of 
the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Holy Mother of God were 
laid in the Kremlin. This made Moscow the permanent center of 
the Russian Orthodox Church, giving it at the time the 
significance of a nationwide center. 
  The 25 years during which the Russian Church was ruled by 
Prelate Aleksiy (1354-1378) were the time of Russia's 
unification [sobiraniye]. During the minority of Grand 
Prince Dmitriy Ivanovich, the head of the Russian Church was de 
facto ruler of the Grand Principality of Muscovy. His missions 
to the Golden Horde produced a lengthy respite from devastating 
raids. And when in 1380 the Tatar warlord Mamay moved against 
Rus, it was Grand Prince Dmitriy of Muscovy who, having been 
blessed by the Venerable Sergiy Radonezhskiy, succeeded in 
bringing together a united Russian host to deliver the Land of 
Russia from destruction. 
  Russia's history offers numerous instructive examples of 
state organization. In parallel with the monarchical nature of 
power in the majority of Russian lands during the period 
preceding the formation of the unified Moscow State, we can also 
see the experience of the lengthy existence of the Novgorod 
Republic, where the three branches of power -- governor 
[posadnik] (the administration), archbishop (spiritual 
leadership and a large proportion of judicial procedures), and 
prince (protection from external danger) -- had their origins in 
the expression of the people's will. 
  G.P. Fedotov, the remarkable Russian thinker from our 
century, perceived Novgorod -- the "Republic of Holy Sophia" as 
he described it -- as the prototype of Russia's future 
democratic structure, underpinned by the primacy of Christian 
values. 
  But no matter what attitude we may adopt toward Russia's 
history following the unification of Rus under the authority of 
the grand prince of Muscovy, it is necessary to admit that 
the Orthodox Church continued to play an important role in 
the consolidation of Russian statehood. 
  The 17th century proved to be especially important. The Time 
of Troubles immediately following the reign of Boris Godunov, 
which was marked by a series of disasters and mainly a 
devastating famine, again brought forth the Orthodox Church as 
the most important factor of national self-awareness, without 
which it would have been impossible to pursue state 
building in Russia. Thus, the Church's blessing of the 
Nizhniy Novgorod resistance made it possible to preserve Russian 
statehood in 1612. 
  In 1613 the Holy Synod, in other words the episcopate of the 
Russian Church and leading representatives of its clergy, 
launched the initiative of convening an Assembly of the Land 
to elect a head of the Russian state. This assembly, 
at which the estates of the Russian Land were represented, was 
an original form of representation of the people, unknown 
in the rest of Europe. After all, the representatives of 
the estates gathered at the Assembly of the Land not to play 
political games or exact privileges from the supreme authority, 
but to answer the question of how the Russian state should be 
structured. At that time the election of Mikhail, the first 
czar from the Romanov dynasty, was conditioned by the fact that 
his father, the prestigious boyar Fedor Romanov, who had been 
forced to become a monk by Boris Godunov and later became 
Metropolitan Filaret of Rostov and Yaroslavl (patriarch of all 
Rus in 1619-1633), was an oustanding spiritual leader of the 
building of the emerging Russian statehood. It is no accident 
that thereafter, and throughout the reign of Mikhail Fedorovich, 
Assemblies of the Land were convened by the supreme authority 
virtually every year to ensure that its initiatives could be 
backed by the Church's authority and become an expression of the 
people's aspirations. 
  A special importance in the cause of state building attaches 
to the 1649 Assembly of the Land, which compiled the Conciliary 
Code which laid the foundation for the codification of Russian 
laws. 
  When Peter the Great started implementing the transformation 
of Russian statehood on the principles of enlightened 
absolutism, he assigned a special role to the church 
administration. Having abolished the patriarchate and halted 
the convening of Holy Synods as the supreme organs of church 
power, he showed concern for forming a permanent supreme 
administration of spiritual forces which was named the Holy 
Governing Synod. In parallel with the Governing Senate, which 
promulgated imperial laws on behalf of the supreme power and was 
also the supreme judicial organ in the country, the Synod -- if 
the monarch was unable to exercise his rights and duties -- 
exercised supreme power in the country until such time as the 
legitimate claimant to the throne was sworn in as head of the 
Russian state. It must be especially noted that the Russian 
[Church] hierarchy played an extremely fruitful role in 
lawmaking activity, in which it was brought by the supreme state 
power, also in the 18th century. 
  Later on, when a representative organs of the people -- the 
State Duma -- emerged in Russia in 1905, it was no rare 
occurrence to see among its deputies bishops and clergy of the 
Russian Orthodox Church, elected mainly by the peasant strata 
which had entrusted them with the protection of their interests 
and the expression of their aspirations. 
  The 1917-1918 Local Assembly became an important landmark in 
the history of the Russian Orthodox Church, restoring the 
Patriarchate of All Russia and the principle of conciliarism in 
church life. Its opening coincided with preparations for the 
Constituent Assembly, which was intended to establish new 
principles of Russian statehood. In this context, the [Local] 
Assembly had a working section on "The Legal Status of the 
Orthodox Church in the Russian State," which based the documents 
it elaborated on the fact that "the Orthodox Church is a most 
sacred object for the vast majority of the Russian people" and 
therefore the state must give it legal protection and patronage. 
  The country's historical fate during the postrevolution 
decades developed in such a way that the Orthodox Church was not 
only deprived of its traditional historical role but, under the 
slogan of its "separation from the state," was also subjected to 
the most blatant persecution; that was a time when its paramount 
concern was the problem of survival in an atmosphere of 
artificially implanted militant atheism. But, despite 
everything, the Russian Church managed to survive and, with the 
passage of time, even to accumulate a certain amount of social 
potential. 
  The word "crisis" is nowadays one of the most frequently 
used 
words in the mass media. But let us ask ourselves: What sort 
of crisis is Russia experiencing now? Economic? It would be 
strange that a country with such natural and industrial 
potential would be incapable of swiftly dealing with it. 
Political? The multiparty system, which is capable of 
producing a serious struggle for power, is still at its 
embryonic stage, as it were, in our country. Nonetheless, we are 
indeed at a stage of crisis at present. And this crisis 
is moral. 
  The main question facing Russia now is: What should be 
the moral guidelines of its future state building? This 
question has to be answered by the people themselves. It would 
be appropriate to recall the traditional form of dialogue 
between the supreme power and the people by convening an 
Assembly of the Land which could comprise authoritative 
representatives of all social and professional groups and the 
traditional religious confessions in Russia. This Assembly 
would not claim state power and would not compete with the 
existing representative organ. It will not adopt any acts for 
mandatory execution. But it will be able to identify the 
sore spots in our people's life today, on which those who have 
been tasked with state building in Russia should focus attention 
in the first place. 
  As regards the participation of the Russian Orthodox Church 
in this Assembly, this will not mean that it is regaining any 
state functions or privileges. But, being an authoritative 
social institution in the country today, it will thus fulfill 
its purpose and will help the Russian people to preserve 
their identity and create their state. 
  The government and the new Federal Assembly are called upon, 
in the very near future and jointly with the Russian Orthodox 
Church, to compile a program for the restoration and 
refurbishing of cathedrals, churches, and monasteries. 
  An end should be put to all attempts at religious invasion 
from outside, no matter how plausible their motivations might 
appear. Missionary activity by foreign citizens in Russia must 
be legislatively regulated. 
<H3>  Section III: III. Stabilization of the Socioeconomic 
Situation in the Country </H3>
  An analysis of the socioeconomic situation in the 14 former 
Union republics of the USSR by international organizations 
indicates that these countries are on the threshold of "a 
large-scale social explosion." 
  The incomes of workers and employees have declined by 21-27 
percent in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and by 59-60 percent in 
Kyryzstan and Tajikistan. The rural population's incomes have 
declined still further: by 33-35 percent in Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan, and by 64-70 percent in Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, 
and Tajikistan. 
  Wage increases cannot keep up with the steady growth of 
consumer goods prices. (Footnote) (According to EEC data, the 
increase of the population's incomes in the CIS is lagging 
behind inflation, and consequently real wages have dropped by 
30-50 percent.) 
  The situation on the market for foodstuffs is especially 
alarming. Even the high prices have failed to solve the problem 
of normal supplies of meat, vegetable oil, and sugar for the 
population. Consequently, "a sizeable proportion of the 
population in the CIS is threatened by famine. Millions of 
people eat irregularly and there is excessive consumption of 
bread and potatoes. The situation is fast deteriorating," 
UNICEF emphasizes, "and three-fourths of the population in many 
regions are living in poverty." 
  The production of consumer goods has significantly declined 
in the CIS countries, including foodstuffs by 22 percent, light 
industry goods by 17 percent, and articles for cultural and 
everyday life use by 14 percent. 
  The commissioning of housing in the CIS as a whole has 
declined by 27 percent, of general educational schools by 33 
percent, of preschool institutions by 32 percent, and of 
hospitals by 37 percent. 
  There has been an acute deterioration in the health care 
system: The appropriated funds are sufficient to cover just 
one-third of requirements. 
  A "new" phenomenon, long-forgotten by generations of 
Russians, has emerged -- unemployment. It is expected 
that the army of spare labor in the CIS will have reached 12 
million persons in the first quarter of 1994. 
  The number of recorded crimes has also increased sharply in 
the Community states -- by 30 percent on average. The highest 
increase is in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan by 50 percent, in 
Azerbaijan and Armenia by 33 percent, and in Russia by 28 
percent. 
  Thus, not a single one of the new sovereign states on 
the USSR's territory has been able to guarantee the life and 
safety of the majority of its population. 
  The absence of guarantees creates a fundamentally new 
sociopolitical situation in the CIS countries, where residents 
in the past felt that they were citizens of a great state. 
  These new conditions will dominate the development of 
sociopolitical events in the CIS also in 1994. 
  It is not only the population but also the authorities that 
feel uneasy in the face of new realities. The problem of 
consolidating power, which is in a state of unstable equilibrium 
in the overwhelming majority of states, will be the main problem 
in 1994. 
  The reforms being implemented by the authorities of the 
sovereign states are inadequately backed by the population, as 
can be seen from the Eurostat data (see Table 1).

|(Footnote) (These data correspond fully with the results of the All-Russia r-| 
|eferendum, when only 34.9 percent of the total population approved the socia-| 
|l policy implemented by the Russian Federation president and government.)    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Thus, almost everywhere (with the exception of Georgia and 
Estonia) the majority of the population expect "harm" rather 
than "benefit" from market economics. In actual fact we can see 
that, first, society is split as regards the essence of reforms 
and, second, there is a low level of approval for them. 
  Western political scientists are seeking the causes of this 
phenomenon. Will Hutton (THE GUARDIAN), for example, having 
analyzed the processes in the former Union, draws the following 
conclusion: "Hardly ever have economists been so involved in 
the sphere of politics with an opportunity to compile plans and 
programs which are far removed from the cultural, social, and 
political context in which they exist. The process of reforms 
has evolved into a technical problem and its success depends on 
the existence of political `will.' It is hard to imagine a more 
simplistic concept." 
  This view is not altogether groundless. 
  The question is: How can sociopolitical processes in the 
CIS countries develop further with today's situation as a 
starting point? There is no doubt that they will have their 
specific aspects everywhere. But there are also common trends. 
The complexities of the problems of authority are largely 
conditioned by the following contradiction. The political 
forces (Footnote) (Meaning the Democratic Congress [Democratic 
Russia, Rukh, Berlin, and so on] and the People's Fronts) which 
brought the incumbent leaders of sovereign states to the summits 
of power, proved capable of destroying the former one-party 
political system, but have so far been unable to create a new 
pluralistic system. As destroying parties, they did not enjoy a 
mighty social base. The current need of all CIS leaders for 
such a social base clashes with the course of reforms being 
implemented, which harm the vital interests of a large 
proportion of the population. 
  The consolidation of democratic power is hindered by the 
marginalization of society and the disintegration of its social 
structure. The "crystallization" of the social structure can 
have a different base in different countries: nationalism, 
religious fundamentalism, patriotism, corporate principles, and 
so on. 
  UNICEF and WHO have forecast massive social explosions on 
the 
ground of dissatisfaction with reforms. The socioeconomic 
tension in Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan 
has shifted to the level of territorial-ethnic conflicts. Such 
conflicts could intensify in Russia and Ukraine. In the Baltic 
countries these conflicts have been moved to the plane of 
relations with Russia and turned into the problem of the 
Russian-speaking population. 
  Similar scenarios in the same or different forms are 
possible 
in virtually any one of the 14 former Union republics. 
<H6>  1. Stabilization and Recovery of the Economy </H6>
  Do we have a chance to revive the economy in the majority's 
interests? Yes, we do. The only problem is to switch on the 
mechanism for rational utilization of Russia's national wealth: 
its intellectual potential and its natural resources. 
  Privatization or nationalization, plan or market -- these 
cannot be examined as the ends of the new economic 
policy. They are only the means. 
  It is necessary not only to simply proclaim the value of 
man, 
his dignity, and his inalienable rights and freedom, but also to 
guarantee them economically for the overwheleming majority of 
citizens. We cannot allow ourselves to "consume" the heritage 
of our grandchildren and ruin our country by selling off the raw 
materials, land, and intellectual property, reducing the level 
of production and the standards of morality, education, health 
care, and ecological safety, and allowing crime to rise. 
  Therefore, the following are suggested as end objectives of 
the new economic course: 
  1. To ensure not just Russia's survival as a unified 
autonomous state, but also its rebirth. 
  2. To occupy a leading position in the group of the world 
community's leader-countries. 
  3. To ensure a befitting quality of life according to world 
standards. 
  Such an effective economic course would require a 
substantial 
revision of federal priorities, a sharp increase 
in the proportion of production investment, enhancement of 
their efficiency, and implementation of state regulation of 
structural changes in production. 
  The distribution of labor, material, and financial resources 
between the civilian and military spheres is one of the most 
important national economic proportions. In view of all the 
peculiarities of Russia's geopolitical situation, it is 
important to bear in mind that military expenditures in 
developed countries account for less than 5 percent of GNP. A 
desire to reach approximately the same degree of nonproductive 
utilization of resources in Russia by the end of this century 
would reduce to a minimum the negative economic consequences of 
military expenditures. 
  The short-term plans should be to ensure the 
economy's stabilization with priority development for the 
sectors geared to satisfying primary vital needs. At the same 
time, investment opportunities for the retooling of production 
should be boosted. 
  The medium-term plans should aim for structural 
changes and renewal of the base resource-saving technologies, 
which will be largely geared to the consumer market. 
  The long-term plans should be to implement a 
transition to an innovation economy, when acceptable losses in 
the rate of economic growth should be the price to paid for the 
pursuit of a policy aimed at social progress and ecological 
safety. 
  A program for the economy's revival must provide guidance 
for actions. Its coordinated principles and guidelines should 
provide the foundation for the authorities' legislative 
activity. Only then will the economy, "working" within a 
legislative framework which promotes its development in the 
interests of the majority of citizens, become really free. 
  In order to gain the people's trust, the government is bound 
to publicize its plans and the progress in their 
fulfillment. Its activity should be judged not only by the 
improved quality of life but also by the protection of the 
interests of all of society's citizens, which should become the 
norm. 
  The question of the optimal pace of transformations remains 
as acute as ever. This pace must not be arbitrarily set, it 
ought to correspond with society's real potential rather than 
with the wishes of the initiators of reforms. The experience of 
Russia and other countries testifies that it is impossible to 
effect privatization and introduce the market at a stroke, or to 
create within a year or two a quantity of private farms which 
could succeed in solving the food problem. At least 10 years 
will be needed to modernize indistry, transportation, and 
agriculture. 
  Any delay in the implementation of pressing transformations 
is equally impermissible. 
  There is no need to conceal from the people the full gravity 
of the situation prevailing in the country. The best possible 
way for extrication from the crisis can be found only by facing 
up to the truth, otherwise we will once more end up with 
numerous promises followed by explanations why they were not 
honored. 
  So far there has been no success in halting or even slowing 
down the slump in production which has been going on for 
three years now. It is approaching 50 percent in industry 
(in other words, production is being almost halved, which would 
bring it down to the level of the 1960's). December 1993 alone 
saw a 12-percent slump. The opposition's claims that the 
country is being deindustrialized reflect not only the 
sharply contested election campaign but also the real 
"development" trends. The situation is equally alarming 
in agriculture and especially in breeding 
stock, where production has declined by 42 percent. 
  The main harbinger of disaster is the fact that the 
foundations of growth have been undermined, since capital 
investments in the national economy have undergone such sharp 
and manyfold reduction, and the renewal of equipment and 
technology has been halted. 
  The slump in production also leads to a decline of the 
population's living standards and a sharp deterioration of the 
population's physical conditions of existence. According to 
data from Russia's Sanitation and Epidemiology Service, 20 
percent of the population suffer from energy famine due to 
inadequate nutrition. It is not in vain that people are already 
talking about the problem of physical survival. 
  A reduction of capital investments and defense expenditures 
will only partly soften the blow on living standards, but it is 
fraught, first with accelerated slump of production and, second, 
with a decline of the country's defense capability and security. 
  The sharp exacerbation of the foodstuffs crisis in the last 
two-three years was conditioned not only by the decline of the 
production of agricultural output. Former and existing 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes and their transformed production 
structures are in a most serious financial situation; they are 
overstocked with output which either fails to reach the consumer 
or, having made its way to him, its price has increased manyfold. 
  It would appear that the following causes have led to the 
sector's stagnation: 

  -  The sharp and sizeable reduction of all types of state 
support for the agro-industrial complex and the elimination of 
the state system for material and technical supplies. 
  -  The disruption of the equivalence of agriculture's 
intesectoral 
and interregional relations with resource-supplying and 
servicing sectors. 
  -  The collapse of organizational structures with organized 
production and the attempts to replace them with new structures 
without the necessary conditions for their effective operations. 
  -  The decline of scientific and technical standards in the 
agro-industrial sector and the degradation of science through 
inadequate funding, which deprives the agro-industrial complex 
of any development prospects. 

    Energetic measures of state protectionism will be 
required in the next few years so as to develop and economically 
consolidate the agro-industrial complex. 
  The sociopolitical situation. Although a 
sizeable proportion of the population remains politically 
indifferent, the last few years have seen an intensive political 
polarization of forces in the country, which has brought 
forth the growing threat of civil war. The events in 
October 1993 most graphically demonstrated this danger. When 
analyzing the causes, it is impossible to allow simplistic 
interpretations and reduce everything to just the activity of 
extremist elements. A considerable role in the 3-4 October 
events was played by the calamitous situation and despair of 
many people, whose living standards have sharply declined and 
whose life's aspirations have collapsed. 
  The causes also include instances of insults against the 
national and patriotic feelings of Russia's population, which 
are frequently encountered in the mass media. If the word 
"patriot" becomes an insult, if Russia's history is grossly 
discredited, if the national culture's world-standard 
achievements are denigrated as being third-rate, and if the idea 
of the people's inadequacy is openly proclaimed, this will 
provoke racial and national enmity. An end must be put to 
this by using the force of the law. 
  The Federal Assembly can serve society's sociopolitical 
consolidation and the pooling of efforts by different political 
forces. There are great opportunities here, since the current 
polarization stems not so much from objective processes but from 
subjective efforts by different political parties and movements. 
<H6>  2. Structural Reorganization of Russia's Economy </H6>
  The crisis in the socioeconomic system is directly reflected 
in the structural and investment crises. 
<H5>  Need for and Problems of Structural Transformations </H5>
  Structural imbalances are the consequence of the economic 
development strategy geared mainly toward maxium growth of the 
state's resources potential and its defense capability. 
  But a noticeable sectoral differentiation is occurring 
against the general background of the slump in production in the 
Russian Federation in 1992-1993. Specifically, there are 
substantial reductions of the volumes of output in the light and 
food industries -- the basis of the consumer complex. 
  The long-term task is to radically renew technologies and 
switch to the science-intensive and ecologically safe variety of 
economic growth. The saving and the more rational and more 
efficient utilization of investment resources are highly 
important for the structural restructuring. This presupposes a 
"revision" of the resource potential of the investment complex. 
  Savings of investment resources are practicable, for 
example: 

  -  in the machine bulding complex via reliance on end 
products and consumer goods; 
  -  in the metallurgy complex via sharp reduction of demand for 
series-produced metal output and the switching of metal from the 
defense complex to civilian machine building; 
  -  in the fuel and energy complex via more rational selection of 
projects for the extraction, transportation, and thoroughness of 
refining oil, gas, and coal. 

    The policy of state regulation of investments could yield a 
positive effect subject to "offensive" and "defensive" measures 
embracing all sectors of the economy and maintaining its 
structural and technological integrity. State support must 
encourage the development of high-tech, science-intensive, and 
competitive production. 
  The strategic line of the sectoral structure's restructuring 
must be the consistent renewal of sectoral technology. 
Priorities must be determined accordingly. It is primarily 
necessary: 

  -  to modernize the production, technical, and scientific 
base in the primary sectors of the fuel and energy complex, 
machine building, agriculture, and transportation via the 
utilization of state and foreign investments, including those 
from nearby foreign countries; 
  -  to create export-oriented production in machine building, 
primarily on the basis of leading military enterprises, and to 
ensure the development of machine tool and instruments 
production, instrument making, electronics, and electrical 
engineering; 
  -  to create import-replacing production in the light industry 
and 
reorientate (replace) the weakened production-sharing links; 
  -  to ensure a reduction of the losses of energy and timber 
resources and agricultural raw materials via high-tech 
processing. 

    In the process of structural reorientation, the state 
cannot be allowed to retreat from the management of economic 
development. It is called upon to elaborate the strategy of 
the conversion of military production and the preservation and 
efficient utilization of the military-industrial potential; to 
pursue a regional policy coupled with the structural 
restructuring of industry; to accumulate material, technical, 
and financial resources for the development of the economy's 
social and cultural sectors (ensuring the social orientation of 
reforms). It is necessary to take stock of industry's 
production, resource, and technology base. 
  The transition to the system of market relations has 
created the most complex survival conditions for virtually all 
industrial production. The prolonged absence of 
formulated priorities in sectoral policy and of a considered 
regional policy has also aggravated the difficulties in the 
modernization of Russia's industrial structure. In the 
conditions of market relations, certain advantages have been 
gained by those who have managed to achieve the narrowest 
possible specialization in production and have then brought 
their output up to modern standards. Of course, in this case we 
are talking about a rational perception of the problems of 
narrow specialization in production, which is not tantamount to 
monopolism. For example, no other country in the world 
practices the utilization of basic production waste by raising 
such waste to the level of consumer goods. It is only in our 
country that the production of consumer goods as a way to 
utilize basic production waste from the country's industrial 
giants has become dominant. 
  The future production of consumer goods by base and defense 
sectors would appear especially problematic in the light of the 
lifting of restrictions on the importation of foreign-made 
consumer goods and of the planned commodity 
"intervention." It is easy to forecast a crash in the 
event of nonspecialized production of consumer goods: A crisis 
of overproduction will occur. In these conditions it is worth 
noting the possibility of manufacturing "dual purpose" articles. 
This will enable the national industry and science to actively 
compete for consumers at the products market and, at the same 
time, will encourage the utilization and improvement of our own 
technological potential. 
  In addition to the fact that industrial enterprises in the 
base sectors will become suppliers of material and social 
consumer goods for the domestic market, they are also mass 
consumers of these goods in the conditions of exacerbating 
economic crisis in the country. What we mean is the adverse 
trend toward the barter of their output for consumer goods, in 
other words the withdrawal of sizeable consignments of goods 
from the market. 
  Unfortunately, the curtailment of supply is gathering pace. 
Consumer goods are at present actively bought for 
intradepartmental distribution. The economy's 
liberalization by the methods of "shock therapy" has resulted in 
major economic and political errors and massive decline of the 
population's living standards. A catastrophic distortion 
has been allowed to occur in the consumer sphere: As a result 
of the reduction of effective demand, noawadays only one person 
out of 1,000 can allow himself, subject to rigid savings from 
the family budget, to buy the cheapest of refrigerators or 
television sets. This imposes restrictive bounds on the 
progressive structure of demand and supply (production). 
  Some people think that there has been and there is no 
alternative to the chosen course. Of course, initially the 
situation was extremely depressing and precluded any swift and 
serious progress. But the weakening of the economy, the 
disintegration of traditional economic ties, and the growing 
inflation -- all this actually generated the need for radical 
measures to restore the manageability of the national economy 
and the utilization of all levers of state influence compatible 
with the process of transition to the market. 
<H5>  Conversion in the System of Structural Changes </H5>
  In the conditions in Russia, which has inherited from the 
USSR a hypertrophied military industry, conversion emerges as a 
major reserve for the country's economic development and for 
substantially boosting the manufacture of civilian commodities 
for consumption and investment purposes. 
  But the switching of military enterprises to civilian tracks 
will require considerable time and major funds. Essentially, 
conversion is an investment process requiring short-term 
expenditure for the sake of long-term benefits. Investment 
decisions affecting the conversion of production, new 
construction, and the organization of supply and marketing have 
always involved risk. The risk associated with the 
implementation of large-scale conversion projects can be reduced 
by in-depth technical and economic studies of the transition to 
the manufacture of new output. 
  The country is profoundly concerned about the progress and 
prospects of conversion activity. In many instances it has 
hardly produced any results, having traversed the path from 
"conversion by edict" to "free-for-all conversion." 
  It would seem expedient to conduct a state inspection 
of major conversion projects in 1994 involving independent 
experts in the analysis of financial and other problems. A 
special government decree could be adopted on the basis of a 
summation of the inspection's results. This is also 
necessitated by the ratification of the Russian Federation's 
military doctrine, whose provisions make it possible to 
determine the scale and pace of the release of resources from 
the military sphere and, correspondingly, of conversion activity 
in the coming years. 
<H5>  The Modern Course of Industrial Policy </H5>
  The objective of the state's selective structural 
policy, in line with the 12 April 1993 decree of the 
Russian Federation Council of Ministers-Government, is to 
ensure the enhanced efficiency of social production via targeted 
changes of its structure, technological standards, and lists of 
items produced, and the stabilization and growth of the 
financial and economic interest of enterprises and 
entrepreneurs. With a view to financial stabilization, the 
government has planned a series of measures regulating the 
federal budget's relations with territorial budgets and so on. 
Credits for industry play a special role in this process. On 
the one hand, the mass provision of credit for enterprises has 
slowed down the accelerating slump in production but, on the 
other hand, it has intensified inflation and has led to the 
stabilization of the flawed structure of production with which 
we are living today. 
  The government took the path of detailing a selective 
structural policy which presupposes choice from options which 
have not lived up to expectations. But our country's 
inefficient economy makes it very difficult to pick a sector 
which can be painlessly abandoned. 
  The selectiveness of structural policy is also based on 
financial levers. The unconditional and efficient utilization 
of limited financial resources presupposes their targeted 
utilization and rigid choice of priorities. At the same time, 
the proclaimed priorities essentially extend to all sectors of 
the national economy. "Capital investments in priority sectors" 
(the fuel and energy complex, the chemical industry, the 
agro-industrial complex, transport and communications, the 
military-industrial complex, and science) account for 70 percent 
of capital investments. If we add to this the investments in 
housing construction, the government intends to control about 90 
percent of all capital investments. The implementation of this 
program will lead not to any enhancement of the state's role, 
but to preservation of its monopoly status in the sphere of 
investments and state control of the formation and distribution 
of financial resources. 
  The state's selective structural program says nothing about 
the economic criteria for assessing the efficiency of investment 
programs and projects. 
  The proposed criterion for sectoral affiliation will lead to 
wholesale provision of credits for sectors regardless of their 
technical standards and production efficiency. The program does 
not reveal the organizational plan of structural policy. In the 
past this was done during the elaboration of state plans which 
included resource indicators, end results, and efficiency levels. 
  In our opinion, the structural investment policy must be 
built on the basis of directive and indicative plans. Moreover, 
the sole criterion of efficiency must be the technical standards 
and competitivenss of production and the extent to which output 
meets world standards. Budget appropriations and credits could 
be allocated for the implementation of such projects. 
  It is well known that a leading position among the 
priorities 
of structural policy is assigned to the development of the fuel 
and energy complex, on which the provision of vital services for 
the economy and the development of export potential depend. 
Here it is necessary to be aware of the danger of hypertrophy 
and the possible transformation of an economy, which may not be 
efficient but is nonetheless industrially developed, into an 
energy and raw materials appendage of the world economy. In 
this context it would appear expedient to elaborate a 
concept of Russia's economic security and its participation in 
the system of international division of labor -- taking 
into account the entire complex of national-state interests, 
including strategic interests. 
  Despite the numerous attempts to stabilize the ruble, 
Russia is in a financial blind alley today. The 
government's anti-inflation measures produce the diametrically 
opposite results. According to our forecasts, the Goznak [Main 
Administration for Production of State Bank Notes, Coins, and 
Medals] printing presses will inevitably work harder in 1994. 
There is a view that an extrication from the crisis is possible 
through the creation of a new ruble. 
  Drawing parallels with the two hyperinflations in Germany, 
for example, we will be unable to cope with this problem without 
international assistance. A Russian international bank ought to 
be set up in Switzerland by decision of the Russian Federation 
Government and the IMF. The IMF could provide the promised $6 
billion as a foreign currency backup for the new ruble. 
  Over a period of 6-12 months Russia will earn a similar 
amount, including earnings from exports, payments for which will 
be paid directly into this bank's account. Having accumulated 
$12 billion, the bank will embark on the launch of a new ruble 
and will begin using the new currency for partial settlement 
with exporting enterprises. The new Russian currency will be 
gradually transferred to the Central Bank of the Russian 
Federation. It will be converted into dollars at the rate of 
1:1. The old and new rubles could circulate in parallel. 
  At the same time, the Russian Federation Government ought to 
launch a large-scale program to combat unemployment. 
The labor force being released could be channeled into the 
building of highways, railroads, and airports. The new rubles 
will be initially concentrated around exporting enterprises, 
enabling them to recruit the most skilled personnel. This will 
serve as an incentive for other enterprises holding foreign 
currency to repatriate it and convert it into new rubles. 
Consequently, the circulation of the new Russian currency will 
be stepped up and this will lead to economic recovery. Once 
Russia has repaid the $6 billion to the IMF, the Russian 
international bank can be moved to Moscow. 
<H6>  3. Agrarian Reform </H6>
  For the fourth year running the economy's agrarian 
sector is experiencing the growing effect of the irreversible 
processes of breakdown of production and its material and 
technical base, impoverishment of the peasantry itself, and 
degradation of the countryside. 
  The socioeconomic situation in the agro-industrial complex 
testifies that the economic reforms being implemented in the 
country have led to a slump in production and have disrupted the 
economic parity prevailing in the early 1990's between rural 
commodity producers and industrial enterprises, and this in turn 
has led to the countryside's devastation, accumulation of debts 
owed by all farms, and protracted crisis. 
  This extremely dangerous situation stems from reforms which 
have not been properly thought out, the price disparity between 
industry and agriculture, and the constantly rising prices of 
all means of production, fuel, and construction and other 
materials used in the countryside. 
  We are seeing primarily the ruin of large-scale specialized 
production which, for the most part, has been up to world 
standards in terms of its efficiency. In stockbreeding, for 
example, these powerful production units are working at just 
one-third of even less of their capacity through the lack of 
feeds. Losses in the stockbreeding sector could be recouped by 
at least 12-15 years of extremely intensive work. 
  The intensification of long-term negative trends, primarily 
the decline of the agrarian sector's production potential, is 
especially alarming. There is a catastrophic decline of soil 
fertility, and virtually all social programs for the 
reorganization of the Russian countryside have been cut back. 
  The rural population's mortality rate in Russia as a 
whole is 32 percent higher than the urban population's. 
Not a single state has ever suffered such losses. 
  Passions have been raging in society over the last few years 
about the right to privately own land and turn it into a 
commodity to be sold and purchased. This most complex 
question ought to be seriously examined. The mass media are 
using the terms "private ownership" and "personal ownership" as 
interchangeable. Nobody objects to the right to privately own 
land in the form of peasants' yards or land parcels for use as 
gardens or kitchen gardens by urban dwellers. On the whole, 
however, land for the commodity production of agricultural 
produce can belong only to those who cultivate it with their own 
labor. P.A. Stolypin, in his 9 November 1909 manifesto, 
allocated a vast quantity of new lands for peasants but did not 
once use the words "private ownership" but spoke of personal 
ownership, in other words possession and utilization, but not 
disposal. 
  Profitability levels should not fall below 75 percent in 
order to ensure the normal functioning of all forms of economic 
management in the countryside. If there is no success in 
establishing control over the formation of prices for the 
countryside's means of production, it will be necessary to 
immediately release the prices of agricultural produce. After 
all, the freedom of some commodity producers should not turn 
into economic bondage for others. 
  Unfortunately, the cancellation of all forms of subsidies 
will only step up the degradation of the countryside and of 
agricultural production. 
  Such irreparable damage must not be allowed to occur. It is 
necessary to use all available and sensible means to prevent the 
collapse of Russia's agro-industrial complex, to radically 
change the financial and credit relations between the state and 
the farms producing agricultural produce, and to put an end to 
government support for the commercial banks' predatory policy. 
Financial and credit policy ought to be in the state's hands. 
  The following must be inalienable components of the 
program for boosting the agro-industrial complex: 


    -  Forming on a voluntary basis a mixed economy in the 
agro-industrial sector and providing state support for 
agricultural enterprises under all forms of ownership and 
management. 
  -  Ensuring price parity in agriculture's intersectoral 
exchange with other sectors of the national economy, and 
establishing stable incomes for agricultural commodity producers 
making it possible to conduct expanded reproduction. 
  -  Ensuring fulfillment of the Law on Grain as regards support 
for grain producers. 
  -  Ensuring transition to a standard land tax for agricultural 
commodity producers, state protectionism in financial policy for 
the agrarian sector, and preferential credits. 
  -  Creating a state food fund. Produce for it could be 
acquired in exchange for resource materials at agreed prices. 
  -  Ensuring in January-February 1994 resources for rural 
commodity producers for the spring sowing campaign: seeds, 
equipment, spare parts, fuel, and lubricants. A decision must 
be adopted on preferential state credits, to be repaid by 
agricultural produce. 
  -  Accelerating the creation of an extra-budget fund for 
financial support for the agro-industrial complex. Special 
attention must be given to the countryside's social development, 
the enhancement of soil fertility, the development of land 
reclamation, machine building, and the processing and food 
industries, and the production of mineral fertilizers and plant 
and animal protection agents. 
  -  Ensuring state support for agrarian science and the 
assimilation of its elaborations in production, and for cadre 
training. 
  -  Reviewing the state's export and import policy as regards 
purchases abroad of agricultural produce produced in the Russian 
Federation. 
  -  Putting a stop to the export of mineral fertilizers needed 
to satisfy domestic demand. 

<H6>    4. The Stabilization of Finances </H6>
  The financial and banking system is in a state of crisis. 
The current problems are largely and historically rooted in 
problems existing earlier in the USSR. The collapse of the 
USSR, together with other political, social, military, and other 
factors not directly associated with finances, has aggravated 
this package of problems severalfold. There is no doubt 
that all these negative factors and their impact on the 
financial system will persist also in 1994. 
  At the same time, there are also the mistakes and errors 
committed recently, which call for special mention. 
  The last two years have shown that the overcoming of the 
slump in production and the acceleration of structural changes 
in Russia's national economy cannot be guaranteed exclusively by 
the means of monetary and credit policy. Furthermore, such an 
approach is flawed in its very foundations. 
  In the conditions of inflation, the capitals of enterprises 
and banks are being swiftly devalued while credit operations are 
being essentially curtailed, even though the indicators -- 
without any adjustment for inflation -- speak of an apparent 
growth of credit operations and foreign currency on balance 
sheets. If they were to be adjusted for inflation, they would 
be sharply reduced. 
  The main causes of inflation are the sharp decline of 
production, the arbitrary prices set by enterprises in 
conditions of monopolism and commodity shortages, the budget 
deficit, the breakdown of economic ties with enterprises in 
former Union republics and CEMA countries, and the exportation 
of Russian commodities at dumping prices. These are the 
factors that lead to an imbalance between the money in 
circulation and the commodities avilable for purchase. 
  Errors in the implementation of economic reforms and the 
super-rigid monetarist credit policy, together with confusion in 
calculations, have intensified the slump in production and 
fueled inflation. The main lever for holding inflation back 
ought to be the credit support for viable enterprises. If 
enterprises do not receive credits to meet production costs and 
cover deferred payments, they would be altogether unable to 
function and, due to mass production stoppages, inflation would 
be many times greater. 
  In conditions that encourage incessant price 
increases and decline of the ruble's purchasing power, it is 
impossible to achieve normal commodity-money circulation, 
including the maintenance of balance between the total price of 
commodities in circulation and the total amount of money 
released into circulation. What should be the specific measures 
that would make it possible to satisfy the commodity market at 
prices acceptable by the majority of the population? 
  One of the strategic solutions is to restrict the amount of 
money in circulation. Last year, this resulted in a huge total 
of reciprocal nonpayments. Prices went up and the enterprises' 
money evaporated. But credit emission is still being curtailed 
by whipping up interest rates. The ruble's purchasing power is 
falling uncontrollably because prices are rising without 
restraint. The imbalance between the value of commodities in 
circulation and the total amount of money in circulation is 
widening. In a normal economic process, money serves as a 
technical means of payment when exchanged for commodities. If 
there is no money, commodity-money circulation is slowed down 
and disrupted, since commodity production is curtailed. 
Although everyone cites the need for credit emission to be held 
back by the Central Bank, commodity producing enterprises are in 
debt. This is confirmed by the correlation of the growth of 
prices and of money in circulation: Over a two-year period the 
former increased by a factor of between 100 and 1,000, while the 
total amount of money increased only by a factor of 10 to 15. 
  While commodity producers are cutting back and curtailing 
production, the budget deficit is growing at a mad pace each 
year. But how are the state's inordinately rising expenses to be 
covered if the enterprises' revenues are falling and, 
consequently, budget revenues from taxation are reduced? The 
difference (approximately 20 trillion rubles) will have to be 
covered by money emission. This reveals the main cause of 
inflation -- budget expenditures are beginning to exceed the 
total value of commodities produced for circulation. 
  But we cannot avoid deliberate and controlled 
inflationary expenditure on investments and the production of 
commodity produce. Even five years ago, the country would 
have needed trillions of rubles to replace worn out equipment 
and thus ensure simple reproduction. This accounts for 50 to 60 
percent of all fixed assets in production. At today's prices, 
the amount of money needed would be 1,000 times greater. 
Without restoring the fixed assets, we will be unable to build 
a market economy and solve social problems. Meanwhile, 
investments in the last two years have been scanty. 
Furthermore, a sizeable proportion has been devalued because 
the investment period spans several years. Investments in 
production have been reduced by a factor of about five compared 
with the minimum that is necessary. Enterprises are 
consuming their depreciation reserves, let alone their profits. 
This is yet another consequence of irresponsibility and the 
false perception of economic freedom. 
  Evidently, we should not count on the foreign credits that 
have been promised. Therefore, in order to revive the 
economy, we will be unable to manage without inflationary credit 
emission, but a credit emission that is accurately verified 
and controlled. It must be noted that in a healthy economic 
system, high interest rates are set in order to reduce 
inflation. In our own conditions today, high interest rates 
prompt a faster pace of price increases and further devaluation 
of money. Fast growth of commodity production can be 
achieved by lowering interest rates while accelerating the 
turnover of funds and providing targeted credits for the 
economy. This means an economic effect for both creditor 
and commodity producer. This is the way to extricate ourselves 
more swiftly from the grip of inflation. 
  But we will change nothing in our life today without solving 
the general questions of financial and economic policy, without 
establishing firm rules of the game. It is, after all, no 
secret: Many people are in favor of a market without rules. 
Primarily middlemen, traders, and dealers. As well as some 
commercial banks with their high interest rates for credits 
funded by their borrowing from the Central Bank, which itself 
sets the tone in this sphere. 
  The rules of the game in the market today can be established 
only by general agreement between all sides. This is normal 
behavior in developed countries. The destruction of what has 
already been created will continue without such an agreement, 
without any organized principles. 
<H5>  The Monetary-Credit System </H5>
  The disparity between the banking system models in Russia 
and 
other countries is the main cause hindering their 
integration in a single financial area. The models applied 
in Russia are substantially different from the models of the 
world's banking business and encourage the 
speculative-commercial accumulation of capital rather than its 
investment in production supplying commodities to the market. 
  The second important reason hindering the 
integration of the Russian and the world's monetary-credit 
systems is the underdevelopment of modern long-term forms of 
settlement in Russia. 
  In these conditions, the attempt to elaborate the best 
possible course in credit policy and reform the system of 
settlements in the national economy is perceived by the Central 
Bank of Russia as a priority task. 
  The objectives of the Bank of Russia's monetary-credit 
policy 
are enshrined in the Basic Guidelines of Monetary-Credit 
Regulation in 1993, ratified by the Supreme Soviet, and in the 
24 May 1993 Economic Policy Statement by the Government and the 
Central Bank. Both documents set the main task of slowing down 
inflation which devalues the population's money incomes and 
savings, deforms production and trade, and distorts economic 
guidelines for participants in economic relations. 
  Proceeding from the premise that the rate of inflation 
depends on the rate of money supply, it ought to be expected 
that, after a certain time lag, credit restrictions should 
result in a slowing down of price increases. But inflation 
stood at 20 percent in June, 22 percent in July, 26 percent in 
August, and 23 percent in September. During the first nine 
months of 1993, wholesale and consumer prices increased by a 
factor of 7.3 and 6.3 respectively. Thus, the basic approach 
toward the curbing of inflation has proved useless. 
  The rising prices of energy sources (of gas in February and 
of coal in July) remained the main factor of inflation. 
  The monopoly status of individual groups of producers 
provided the main cause of the accelerated increase of wholesale 
prices and, after a brief interval, of consumer prices as well. 
Inflation in Russia is expected to reach 900 to 1,000 percent 
in 1993 as a whole. 
  The state of the monetary-credit sphere remains very 
complex. 
It is not only instability in the economy but also uncertainty 
as regards the state budget that hinder any forecast of the 
future dynamics of growth of the money in circulation and, 
consequently, any effective regulation of its level. 
  In order to ensure a stable reduction of the rate of 
inflation, the Central Bank's actions ought to be backed by an 
appropriate budgetary and taxation policy. The inefficient 
distribution of centralized credits is fraught with the danger 
that a new crisis of nonpayments might develop; large-scale 
financial injections might be required in order to avoid it and 
this, in its turn, will lead to an expansion of unsatisfied 
effective demand and higher rates of inflation. The gravity of 
this threat is proved even more graphically by the fact that 40 
percent of centralized credits received by enterprises are used 
by them to cover current debts. 
  It is necessary to enhance the efficiency of 
supervision and control of the activity of commercial banks. 
  When financing regional programs, it is necessary to utilize 
the potential of credit partnerships and the advantages of 
mortgage credit, and to create municipal banks. As regards 
targeted state credits, these funds ought to be primarily 
channeled into the implementation of specific projects 
associated with the development of market infrastructure at 
regional level. 
  The most important prerequisite for an efficient credit 
policy and the improvement of the payments and settlements 
system is to preserve the common economic area and the unified 
monetary-credit and banking system within Russia's framework. 
<H5>  Settlements Between CIS States </H5>
  One of the most complex problems concerns settlements with 
the CIS states, many of which have either switched, or are in 
the process of switching, to their own monetary systems. The 
regulation of interstate settlements is hindered by the ruble's 
uncertain status and by the difficulties standing in the way of 
coordinating the monetary-credit policy of central or national 
banks in the former USSR republics. 
  Russia must build its relations with former USSR republics 
with due consideration for their policy aimed either at 
preserving the single economic and currency area or at 
withdrawing from it. 
  The agreement between Russia and Belarus on the unification 
of their banking systems could serve as a prototype of new 
financial relations in the CIS. 
<H5>  Taxes, Credits, Banks </H5>
  Taxes, credits, consumption funds, and wages remain the main 
levers for state regulation of market relations. Taxation 
policy must limit the volume and size of these taxes and must 
encourage and stimulate coomodity producers not in words but by 
lowering the tax liability of those who boost production and by 
giving preferential credits, while the banks should amend the 
normatives for the formation and utilization of these funds. 
The banks must stimulate and encourage them to boost the volume 
of investments in production. 
  If we were to admit today that commodity producers must be 
supported, these specific amendments must be enacted in current 
legislation and any additional laws that might be needed must be 
adopted. 
  A major mistake is being committed today: Attempts are made 
to restrain inflation by virtually nothing but monetarist 
methods -- by raising the base rate and rigidly limiting the 
credits for enterprises. And yet the ruble's strength depends 
mainly on the status of material production and the balance of 
the state budget. So far, the economy in Russia has not been 
functioning as a self-tuning mechanism. Therefore, it is of 
course a mistake to apply all the methods which operate in a 
developed market economy. In these conditions, a moderately 
tough credit policy would be the most appropriate. It must be 
tough but, nonetheless, we have no right to deprive the healthy 
nucleus of the country's economy of credit overnight. 
  There is the especially urgent question of the 
concept of the further development and building of our 
national banking system. Russia has approximately 1,800 
commercial banks, 88 percent of which are small and medium banks 
with a registration capital of up to 100 million rubles. Their 
interests must also be taken into account. After all, there is 
no uncommitted money in Russia, no such money is held by the 
enterprises and organizations which are the main founders of 
banks. 
  The Economic Market Conditions Center under the Russian 
Federation Council of Ministers-Government conducted a study of 
the business activity of Russia's commercial banks. There were 
173 banks taking part in the poll: 79 small, 46 medium, and 48 
large ones. An analysis of the replies showed that the majority 
of bankers believe in an opportunity to improve the situation of 
both their own banks and of the banking system as a whole. 
Higher profits are anticipated by 92 percent of them. Nine out 
of every 10 banks expect to boost their reserves. None of the 
banks has any intention of reducing its staff numbers, while 
some even expect to increase their staff. 
  Nonetheless, about 40 percent of bankers report 
possible cutbacks in their services for state enterprises: 72 
percent believe that the financial-economic situation of their 
clients in the state sector will deteriorate; more than 
one-third of banks do not expect their deposit base to be 
boosted by state enterprises. 
  Almost all banks reported that they do not plan any 
cutbacks in credits for commercial structures in 1994. In this 
process, they will give preference to short-term credits. 
  The commercial banks are striving to expand the sphere of 
their operations. But the investment of the banks' own funds in 
commercial enterprises is a high-risk operation that could lead 
to a reduction of their capital availability and the emergence 
of difficulties with liquidity and solvency. Furthermore, in 
individual cases, the banks use for such purposes not only their 
own funds but also funds attracted from their clients, thus 
exposing not only themselves but also their depositors to 
additional risks. 
  In this context, the Bank of Russia plans to submit a 
proposal on amendments to banking legislation as regards 
limiting the proportion of the bank's own capital being utilized 
and the formation of registered capital by other nonbanking 
legal entities. 
  We need to work on a law on banks and banking operations and 
the central bank and, in all likelihood, it will serve a dual 
purpose. 
  Many of the administrative measures today are essentially 
antimarket, antientrepreneurial, and antistate. There is 
a trend toward transforming the Russian economy into an economy 
dependent on the world market and the developed countries. 
  It is necessary to change the course of economic policy and 
the strategy and tactics of economic reforms; we should bring to 
the foreground the priorities of our own country's 
industrialists, entrepreneurs, agrarians, private farmers, and 
workers. This means amending all the components of 
financial-credit policy, including taxation, budget, foreign 
economic activity, and privatization. 
  Destatization and privatization must be 
conducted on legitimate grounds and in the interests of the 
widest possible social strata. But the means and methods of 
privatization being applied today are a retreat from Russian 
laws and a disregard for the interests of our country's 
industrialists and entrrpreneurs. Controlling blocks of shares 
in many privatized plants and highly profitable Russian 
enterprises are often acquired by foreign capital through 
proxies. 
  The strengthening and stabilization of the Russian 
ruble is the most important condition for the national 
economy's revival. The policy being pursued today certainly 
needs amendment, because it is making the Russian national 
currency dependent on the demand for and supply of foreign 
currencies, on the dollarization of the Russian market. 
  The strengthening of the ruble will also be served by the 
imposition of order in foreign economic activity, 
which incurs major losses of foreign currency. But even here 
the government still retains unjustified import subsidies and 
increases duties and taxes which raise prices still higher and 
fuel inflation. 
  Now it is already perfectly clear that the period of 
transition to the new economy will take years. Bearing this 
fact in mind, the government and the Central Bank must elaborate 
a long-term economic and credit-monetary policy, in which 
a central position should be assigned to the state regulation of 
the economy and the creation of favorable conditions for 
the development of productive and entrepreneurial activity. 
  In the long term, financial stabilization lays the 
foundations for growth of investments, but for the short term it 
can be confidently forecast that there will be a further 
reduction of investments in the national economy which, in the 
conditions of high degree of wear and tear or obsolescence of a 
sizeable proportion of fixed assets, could lead to a decline of 
technological discipline, accidents, substandard output, and 
breakage of technological links. 
  Among the questions of foreign currency-financial 
policy the main problem is not the choice of a rate of 
exchange system but the creation of economic prerequisites for 
its stabilization. We deem it expedient to aim for a 
breakthrough in the movement of the ruble's rate of exchange 
exclusively through official foreign currency investments. The 
use of intervention could be aimed at smooting out any excessive 
short-term fluctuations of the rate of exchange. 
  It is necessary to adopt substantial measures to impose 
effective foreign currency control in the Russian 
Federation, specifically to set up a Russian Federal Foreign 
Currency Control Service. 
  The Bank of Russia must organize more effective control over 
the movement of funds to correspondents' accounts held by 
Russian commercial banks for foreign banks. Legislative 
provision must also be made ruling out the transfer of foreign 
currency by natural persons to banks abroad and stepping up 
liability for breaches of foreign currency and customs 
legislation. 
  There is another important problem. Russia lacks funds for 
financing capital investments and the elaboration of 
innovations, which have a vast potential. This question must be 
solved in a largely decentralized manner. The banks 
participating in venture operations can earn sound returns, but 
their efforts must be channeled toward the coordination of 
resources. 
  We believe that the funds of commercial banks held in the 
Central Bank's reserves must be utilized for investments rather 
than for refinancing or for covering the budget deficit. This 
is yet another source of inflation. 
  Information about the status of finances, money circulation, 
and the credit market is highly important for the successful 
development of the new credit system and the stabilization of 
finances. 
<H6>  5. Social Policy </H6>
  Last fall a session of Russia's Ministry of the Economy 
Collegium examined the question "On the Draft Balance of the 
Population's Money Incomes and Expenditures in 1994." It 
analyzed the dynamics and structure of the formation and 
utilization of the population's money incomes in the past and 
the prospects for any possible changes in the future. 
  The liberalization of prices and the restraints on increases 
of wages and social benefits have resulted in a sharp decline of 
the real value of the population's money incomes. The 
earnings of Russia's population fell short by about 900 billion 
rubles [R] while the losses incurred by depositors, according to 
data of Russia's Goskomstat, amounted to R460 billion. 
  According to experts' estimates, the population's 
money incomes in 1994 will reach R68,300 billion. Bearing in 
mind that consumer prices are estimated to increase more than 
10-fold, the real value of money incomes will be significantly 
reduced. 
  A further growth of the population's nominal money incomes 
is 
planned for 1994. The average monthly wage in material 
production sectors will reach R350,000 (it is estimated that the 
average wage of workers in Russia was about R80,000 in September 
1993). Thus, there will be no success in slowing down the 
decline of the population's living standards. 
  Errors and mistakes in the elaboration and implementation of 
economic policy in the last few years have resulted in a 
catastrophic decline of living standards. Thus, compared with 
the end of 1991, the nominal increase of the population's money 
incomes managed to provide only 50-percent compensation for the 
increase of prices. In terms of the level of consumption of 
material goods. Russia has found itself (in terms of different 
categories of products and nonfood goods) thrust back by 10-20 
years. 
  There is also a deterioration of the structure of services 
rendered to the population, a structure which remains extremely 
defective. According to data of Russia's Goskomstat (based on 
results for the first nine months of 1993), dominant position 
was still held by passenger transport services, which currently 
account for 40 percent. The proportion of paid services by 
cultural institutions is declining due primarily to the reduced 
number of vistors. The high costs of travel and stay and the 
unstable situation in many of the traditional tourist resorts 
have curtailed the opportunities for meaningful rest by the 
population. Expenditure on payment for recreational services 
account for only 8.9 percent of the total expenditures by the 
population (against 9.7 percent in 1992). The housing and 
municipal services complex accounts for 12 percent of the total 
volume of services, 7 percent of which represents payment for 
housing. 
  One of the most negative results of the current economic 
policy is the sharp decline of the real value of the 
population's money savings. The GDP deflator increased by a 
factor of 430.8 between 1991 and mid-1993. As regards the 
population's financial deposits held by the Savings Bank, they 
have increased by a factor of only 6.5. Thus, taking into 
account the decline of the ruble's purchasing power, the 
population's money savings have been devalued by 98.5 percent. 
  According to Ministry of Labor calculations, Russia now 
has a stratum of superrich people -- about 3 million 
persons. They are mainly leaders of brokerage firms, 
commercial banks and exchanges, and individuals engaged in 
export-import operations. This group also includes criminals -- 
corrupt representatives of executive power and the bosses of 
organized crime who belong to the population group enjoying 
superhigh incomes. The main sources of the initial accumulation 
of capital are speculation, usury, appropriation of rent 
revenues formerly paid to the state, and criminal activity. 
Thus society is being rapidly stratified into a relatively 
small prospering stratum and the bulk of the poor mass of the 
population. According to Ministry of Labor data, "the poorest" 
comprise 40-50 percent, and the "simply poor" comprise 30-35 
percent of the population (see Table 2).

  *(Footnote) (The Dzhini coefficient shows the nature of the 
distribution of the population's total incomes among its 
individual groups. The higher the degree of society's 
polarization by level of income, the closer this coefficient is 
to 1. Conversely, in conditions of equal distribution of 
incomes in society, the Dzhini coefficient equals 0. 
[Rossiya-93, Ekonomicheskaya Konyunktura (Russia-93, Economic 
Market Conditions), Third Edition, Center of Economic Market 
Conditions under the Russian Council of 
Ministers-Government)] 
  The middle stratum of the population, which was numerically 
the largest in the past, now comprises only 10-15 percent. At 
the same time, it is undergoing a sharp deterioration of its 
professional and social structure. Formerly the middle class 
consisted mainly of skilled workers, the intelligentsia, and 
managers. Now all these strata have dropped to the social 
bottom. The growing difference in the sphere of material goods 
depends very little on personal effort. Some people are 
enriching themselves on a hitherto unprecedented scale at the 
cost of other people's impoverishment. 
  The level of the education and skills of the overwhelming 
part of workers and employees does not correspond with the level 
of their wages, since the ongoing social stratification -- in 
terms of scale and of orientation -- does not correspond with 
the changes in the economy and the employment of the population, 
whose parameters are comparable with those in the majority of 
developed countries. 
  1994 will see a continuation of the formation of a 
lower stratum of the population which is numerically large but 
lacks sufficient purchasing power, whose family members are 
forced to channel almost all of their money incomes into the 
satisfaction of primary needs rather than into the acquisition 
of consumer durables and savings, in other words the 
prerequisites for creating a firm base for stable long-term 
economic growth are being undermined. 
  The rising prices of the output of the fuel and energy and 
raw materials complexes have resulted in headlong increases of 
the prices of all other goods and services. This is the 
determining factor of the growth of both wholesale and consumer 
prices. 
  Thus, two years after the announcement and start of 
implementation of stabilization measures in Russia, there have 
been no positive changes in the race between consumer prices and 
the population's money incomes. 
<H6>  6. Toward Realism in Economic Policy </H6>
  Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Federation 
Council of Ministers, and Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the 
Central Bank of Russia, adopted the joint "Statement on the 
Economic Policy of the Government and Central Bank of Russia." 
This document defines the basic guidelines which the government 
and the Bank of Russia intend to follow when pursuing the policy 
of financial stabilization and market development through the 
end of 1993 and in 1994. The official joint statement omits to 
appraise the economic policy being pursued. 
  In 1992-1993 state enterprises strove to compensate the 
growing shortage of means of payment primarily by raising the 
prices of their manufactured output. Furthermore, deliveries 
were effected despite the fast growth of reciprocal nonpayments. 
Essentially, the enterprises' indebtedness started playing 
the role of additional money in circulation, seriously weakening 
the financial restrictions of price increases. Thus, 
restrictive measures in the financial-budget and monetary-credit 
spheres of economic regulation proved ineffective. 
  The progressive decline of the volume of output of 
industrial 
production and the rash abolition of state controls over incomes 
and prices not only prevented a substantial reduction of 
effective demand but also encouraged the widening of the 
previously formed gap between total demand and supply. This gap 
acquired qualitatively new features, causing an inflationary 
growth of prices and a corresponding decline of the population's 
real incomes and living standards. 
  The snowballing destruction of economic ties, the decline of 
contractual discipline, and the substantial deterioration of the 
enterprises' financial positions have aggravated the situation. 
  The enterprises' mass indebtedness necessitated a choice 
between tough "monetarist" policy at any price, even including 
the closure of numerous production units, and support for 
investment and consumer demand and business activity. The 
development of events forced both the government and the Central 
Bank to urgently adopt measures and economic decisions along 
frankly proinflationary lines. There were reciprocal write-offs 
of nonpayments and enterprises were given financial 
"sustenance," which somewhat eased the nonpayments crisis. 
  But the reduction of inflation remains the fundamental 
objective of economic policy. Quantitative restrictions have 
been substantially eased. The plans were that the monthly rate 
of inflation would be brought down to below 10 percent by the 
end of 1993, and that price stabilization would be attained in 
1994. 
  The Statement does not contain any quantitative restrictions 
on the amount of budget deficit, and this is a clear retreat 
from previous intentions. 
  The Statement lays down that the total budget deficit will 
be 
limited by quarterly guidelines which, in their turn, ought to 
correspond with the Central Bank of Russia's quarterly limits on 
the total growth of credits. 
  Russia's government and Central Bank agreed with the 
proposal 
to gradually abandon the provision of all categories of targeted 
credits along Central Bank lines and to switch to the provision 
of subsidies only from the budget. With a view to implementing 
monetary-credit policy on a market basis, the Central Bank of 
Russia will substantially increase the proportion of credits it 
gives to commercial banks either through credit auctions or on 
market terms. The Central Bank also pledged to refrain from 
distributing targeted credits on a sectoral or regional basis 
and to give credits directly to specific enterprises. 
  In the sphere of currency exchange rates it was confirmed 
that the government perceives the creation of a standard market 
rate for the ruble as a key element of the transition to market 
economy. The Statement evades the question of the ruble's 
convertibility, noting that the transition to a stable exchange 
rate is a strategic task. 
  Thus, it appears that there is a gradual movement 
toward a strategic course whose objective is to enhance the 
manageability of the national economy and formulate a sober 
policy of state regulation of economic processes. The 
means are: selective support for production, moderately rigid 
monetary-credit policy, and manageable inflation even at the 
cost of budget deficit. Only then will it be possible to boost 
output, which ought to produce a stabilizing effect. 
  In order to change the overall socioeconomic situation in 
the 
country for the better and overcome the economic crisis of the 
last few years in 1994, it will be necessary to resolve 
the following key tasks: 
  1. To halt the slump in production which has been continuing 
for three years running. 
  Sectors of the fuel and raw materials complexes, sectors 
producing semimanufactured goods, and agriculture will find 
themselves in an especially difficult position. The reasons are 
the shortfall in investments in these sectors in previous years 
and the curtailment of effective demand. This negative trend 
can be overcome only if the state steps up its structural 
regulation of the economy. It is necessary to define 
macroeconomically effective investment projects and finance them 
from centralized sources. 
  2. It will also be necessary to elaborate effective 
measures to ensure that the population continues to keep savings 
in the banks, even in conditions of declining levels of real 
money incomes. 
  3. To formulate and consistently implement a policy of price 
control, combining the regulated and free sectors in price 
formation. 
  The implementation of the proposed measures will, to a 
certain extent, make it possible to ease the acuteness of 
unemployment, which will be the main problem in the social 
sphere next year. At present, despite the sizeable slump in 
production, the unemployed represent only 4-5 percent of the 
able-bodied population. The stepping up of investment activity 
will lead to a revival of production and, consequently, to the 
maintenance of employment. This could be the only method for 
compensating the further decline of living standards. Due to 
the shortage of resources, the state will be able to help only 
the most deprived strata of the population -- pensioners, the 
disabled, and young families with children -- and only at 
minimal levels. 
  Only the fulfillment of these conditions will make it 
possible in 1994 to ensure stabilization of the economy, satisfy 
the population's most important vital needs, and create 
prerequisites for further stable economic development. 
<H3>  Section IV: IV. Protection of the Interests of 
Russian-Speaking Population </H3>
<H6>  1. The Contemporary Status of Russians </H6>
  The status of Russians today could become the most 
probable cause of local civil wars. People in a 
series of new states have moved from words and slogans to actual 
deeds. Latvia and Estonia, for example, beneath the banner of 
protecting the "indigenous population," have started introducing 
restrictions on the rights of the nontitular population, 
primarily via legislation on citizenship. 
  Let us recall that about 40 percent of the population 
in Latvia and Estonia are Russian-speakers, with 10 percent in 
Lithuania, while the total number of Russian-speakers, mainly 
Russians, in the Baltic countries approaches 2.5 million. 
Now they all are an ethnic minority. 
  There are about 950,000 Estonians and at least 600,000 
"foreigners" living in Estonia at present. This separation was 
effected on the basis of a juridical act adopted by parliament 
-- the decree bringing into force the Law "On Citizenship" as it 
stood on 16 June 1940, in other words the day when the Red Army 
entered the republic. The residence qualification is two years, 
with another year before citizenship is acquired. 
  The law adopts a rigid approach toward representatives of 
the 
nonindigenous population who are already residents and 
have spent many years working for the benefit of Estonia. 
Now they have to undergo the two years' residence qualification 
period and a further year on probation, and must pass 
examinations in the language and their knowledge of the 
republic's history and culture. 
  Under the laws, more than 1.5 million people, who are 
automatically deprived of citizenship in the Baltic republics, 
could find themselves outside the political process. Their 
interests will not be represented by anyone. 
  Even the previous elections to Latvia's Supreme Soviet 
demonstrated the radical politicians' obvious desire to squeeze 
Russian-speakers out of the political process. By simply 
manipulating the organization of electoral districts, they 
ensured that the "indigenous" Lettish population 
representing just over 50 percent, won two-thirds of seats 
in the Supreme Soviet. 
  Under the new citizenship laws, the Russian-speaking 
population in Latvia and Estonia will not be represented 
at all in the organs of state power. 
  There is a sharp reduction of television and radio 
broadcasts 
from Russia. It is planned to legislatively deprive major 
Russian communities in the Baltic countries of the right to 
acquire higher education in their native language. A unilateral 
curtailment of the network of Russian secondary education is 
under way. 
  The offensive against Russian culture and the Russian 
language is one of the avenues of massive pressure on the 
Russian-speaking population of the Donbass, accounting for 50-75 
percent of the total population in different rayons. Moreover, 
the fact that this offensive is carried out on such a massive 
scale and with impunity makes it possible to describe it as 
Ukraine's state policy in a region with its own history, 
culture, and real bilingualism. The task of leveling the 
national-cultural situation in West Ukraine and the Donbass by 
force has been set at state level. 
  This is proved by numerous facts. All the educational 
establishments are sharply and groundlessly reducing the number 
of study periods for Russian language and literature, while the 
study of the Russian language is altogether ruled out at teacher 
training institutes' nonspecialized faculties. Thus, the 
Lugansk Teacher Training Institute's Russian Philology Faculty 
has been persistently instructed by ministerial circles to 
delete from its curriculum the practical training in folklore 
and dialectology (gathering examples of folk art and Russian 
dialects). The reason given is that there are no regions where 
Russian culture has developed in the Donbass, even though 
years-long expeditions prove something completely different: 
Russian folk songs, tales, poems, and so on are widespread in 
the region, and so are Russian dialects associated primarily 
with the historical proximity of the Don Host. 
  There is a noticeable trend toward the creation of unequal 
conditions for tuition: The number of pupils at classes taught 
in the Ukrainian language is lower than that of pupils in 
classes taught in the Russian language by a factor of between 
three and five, but the teaching of a foreign language from the 
first grade is introduced mainly in classes taught in the 
Ukrainian language, and so are the new and promising cirriculums 
in general. The new forms of educational establishment are also 
geared to instruction in the Ukrainian language -- in Lugansk's 
only high school, for example, classes studying language and 
literature in depth are geared almost exclusively to the 
Ukrainian language. 
  Psychological pressure is exerted on lecturers teaching 
their 
students in the Russian language, and incentives are offered to 
those who teach specialized subjects only in the Ukrainian 
language. This naturally produces a drain of skilled 
specialists. 
  At the same time, people are deliberately keeping silent 
about the fact that the Union republics, thanks to efforts by 
the entire former Union and the Russian Federation's decisive 
contribution, created modern sectors of the national 
economy using technology that was at times more advanced than in 
the Russian Federation itself. The best forces of the 
entire country were thrown in to ensure higher and faster 
development rates for the former Union republics' economies, 
thus creating more favorable prerequisites for the 
formation of production and social infrastructures actually 
there, rather than in the Russian Federation. 
  The national intelligentsia, actively influencing the 
self-awareness of the peoples, perceived the Russians as 
the most substantial obstacle to the republics' sovereignty 
and to the manifestation of nationalist ambitions. 
  The status of Russians in Kazakhstan is indicative in this 
regard. The introduction of a discriminatory law on languages 
in the republic prompted a huge wave of dissatisfaction among a 
large proportion of the population. Russians and 
Russian-speakers, deprived of any real opportunity to study the 
Kazakh language in the past, are unable to actively participate 
in the various spheres of society's life -- production, 
education, science, management, the services sphere, and so on. 
The present language tuition system falls short of the demands 
posed by life. Dissatisfaction with the law is also expressed 
by 40 percent of Kazakhs who are not fluent in their native 
language. 
  The discriminatory nature of the state program on the 
language is boosted by the policy of state publishing houses. 
Thus, under the subject-matter plan for literary publications, 
the republic's "Ana Tili" Publishing House should have published 
79 titles. The plans included the publication of nine books in 
the Russian language and nine in the Russian and Kazakh 
languages -- these are dictionaries. The remaining titles -- 61 
books in all -- are in the Kazakh language. The proportion is 
identical at other publishing houses. And yet it is emphasized 
that the republic is multinational and that Kazakhstan has 
signed the Human Rights Charter. 
  The situation prevailing in the education system is no 
better. Secondary schools are increasingly often converted and 
are switching to tuition exclusively in the Kazakh language. 
Furthermore, this is being done without augmenting the 
educational premises, thus overloading the schools where tuition 
is in the Russian language. No Russian, German, Ukrainian, or 
other schools are being opened at all. 
  Prospering enterprises are under attack by the nationalist 
mafia. Following several attacks, there are neither Russians 
nor Germans left any more at the "Pravda" Sovkhoz, the best in 
the republic. Here is a typical case: There was an explosion 
at the Ust-Kamenogorsk nuclear fuel plant's beryllium production 
unit, and 120,000 persons suffered as a result. A session of 
Kazakhstan's Supreme Soviet, taking into account the 
"separatism" of Ust-Kamengorosk's residents who demanded 
bilingualism, refused to proclaim the oblast an ecological 
disaster zone. 
  The galvanization of the Cossack movement is encountering 
sharp reaction. Kazakhstan contains the lands of four Cossack 
hosts -- the Ural, Orenburg, Siberian, and Semirechensk. 
Cossack organizations are not being registered by the 
Kazakhstani authorities at present, while local courts have 
firmly ruled that "there are and there will be no Cossacks in 
Kazakhstan" and they are not allowed to wear their uniforms. 
Cossack publications are banned and they are illegally imported 
from Samara and Orenburg. A draft law is being prepared, under 
which work in Cossack organizations will be punishable. 
  The results of inequality are obvious: More than 200 of the 
Kazakhstani parliament's 360 deputies are Kazakhs, and so are 23 
of the Presidential Council's 30 members, even though Kazakhs 
constitute significantly less than one-half of Kazakhstan's 
population. 
  Academician Sartayev, adviser to Kazakhstan's president, 
declares: "Kazakhstan's lands must belong to the Kazakhs," 
forgetting that, back in the 1920's, the Union leadership's 
decisions on the creation of the Republic of Kazakhstan spoke 
openly of transferring to it a series of Russian oblasts. 
  There have been numerous attempts to insult the Russian 
people's heritage: Names that have been Russian since time 
immemorial are dsiappearing from geographical maps, the church 
at the village of Kotelnikovskaya has been burned down, the 
monument to Yermak the Great has been barbarously destroyed, all 
Russian names are being systematically eliminated in 
Kazakhstan's Guryev and other oblasts, while Guryev itself has 
been renamed Atyrau. 
  The falsification of history is becoming increasingly 
blatant: "Russia conquered and enslaved Kazakhstan" and so on. 
S. Akatayev, leader of the "Azat" movement, would allow 
Russians, Germans, and Uygurs to live in Kazakhstan because "we 
need someone to milk the cows, till the soil, and cast the 
metal." He is backed by S. Yermekova, representative of the 
"Alash" party: "You are allowed only to work in Kazakhstan. 
Keep your noses out of management." 
  The question of citizenship ought to be resolved in early 
1994. The republic's Russian-speaking population will have to 
make a choice: Either to accept citizenship and legally lose 
any hope of help from Russia, or reject citizenship and be 
deprived of all political and economic rights. Therefore, a 
sizeable proportion of the Russian-speaking population is 
inclined toward the idea of migrating to Russia, especially 
since Russia has already adopted laws regulating the legal 
status of refugees. 
  A sizeable proportion of the Russian population living on 
the 
territory of former Union republics no longer comprises 
first-generation migrants and has, with perfect 
justification, considered these republics to be its 
motherland. Thus, more than one-half of Russians in the 
Baltic countries have been born there. Approximately two-thirds 
of them in Latvia either are natives of the republic or were 
brought there as children. The majority of the remaining 
one-third arrived in Latvia not of their own free will but 
were posted there on the republic's request as specialists in 
the national economy, or were ordered to go there as 
officers. They restored the war-torn towns and villages, 
rebuilt the plants and factories, or performed their military 
duty. Their children and grandchildren were born there. 
  Fear for their nearest and dearest and uncertainty about the 
future are forcing Russians to leave the Baltic countries and 
Moldova where the Declaration of Human Rights is crudely 
trampled and there is overt discrimination against the 
Russian-speaking population. Huge masses of people in these 
regions believe that they have been abandoned to the whims of 
fate and that Russia is incapable of upholding their 
interests. 
  Migration processes in the Central Asian and Transcaucasian 
republics depend on the overall status of interethnic problems, 
and any interethnic clash threatens to bring forth an exodus of 
the Russian population. 
  Thus, the protection of the rights and legitimate 
interests of the Russian diaspora in nearby foreign countries is 
the only farsighted long-term policy. The strategic task 
along this avenue is to achieve guaranteed living and working 
conditions for Russians outside the Russian Federation which not 
only would rule out any encouragement of their departure but 
also would really create prerequisites for the preservation of 
their national traditions, language, culture, and national 
self-awareness. We perceive this prospect as the development of 
economic, cultural, and political trends aimed against any 
attempts to establish reactionary ethnocratic regimes on the 
vast spaces of the former Union. 
  It is, of course hardly possible to rely on objective 
reintegrational tendencies for reviving that which has collapsed 
under the weight of accumulated contradictions and gross errors 
by shortsighted politicians. There is no subjunctive mood in 
history. 
  There is, however, an alternative to such a development of 
events. But it is lamentable. It is, first, the 
loss of economic independence by the newly formed states, 
including Russia, following the disintegration of the single 
economic area and the national economic complex which was 
unified until the recent past; their distinctive 
"Westernization" and their transformation into underdeveloped 
appendages of major Western countries with a mafia-criminal 
domestic economic and political structure. It is, 
second, the intentional or unintentional flare-up of 
inter-nation or interethnic conflicts either as a result of the 
exacerbation and deterioration of the socioeconomic situation 
and the impoverishment of broad strata of the population, or due 
to the insolubility of questions pertaining to national-state 
belonging of various territories, military property, and other 
categories of former Union property. 
  If the gravest of consequences for all our peoples are to 
be avoided, it is impossible to ignore in politics the 
thousand-years old trend toward ethnic and ethnocultural 
development and collaboration, as a result of which a 
special type of Eurasian civilization started developing a 
long time ago across the spaces of Russia and its associated 
territories. The preservation of one's own state identity today 
is a question not only of human dignity but also of political 
wisdom. 
  All these changes will inevitably have an impact on millions 
of Russians and their relatives in Russia. It is natural that 
such a turn of events will inevitably prompt a social explosion 
including -- and let us have no illusions on this account -- in 
Russia itself, and will become a powerful factor for the 
development of interstate conflicts. Pretending not to realize 
this means directly encouraging such a development of events. 
<H6>  2. Political Aspects </H6>
  A legitimate way out of the situation, from all points of 
view, could be provided only by restoration of the common 
economic, cultural, and legal area; unconditional removal of 
trade barriers; introduction of benefits for members of the new 
economic and defense union; adoption of common citizenship. 
  In the ninth year of "perestroyka" and after three years of 
"democratization," Russia lacks a clear foreign policy 
concept. There has been no definition of Russia's priorities or 
a concept of the new integrational cooperation across the former 
USSR. This is precisely why the sluggish activity of the 
CIS has produced no positive results. 
  Russia's national priorities must indeed be the 
interests of the peoples of the Russian Federation and of the 
largest among them, the Russian people, which has for centuries 
been Russia's unifying nucleus and has already proved its 
consolidating role. 
  Consequently, all diplomatic, foreign political, and foreign 
economic efforts must focus primarily on Russia's alliance 
with the former Union republics which have a large proportion of 
Russian and Russian-speaking population. They are 
primarily Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova. This will make it possible 
to solve the problem of almost 90 percent of ethnic Russians and 
of many Russian citizens who are residents in these states. It 
is in Russia's national interests, and regardless of the Russian 
diaspora's size, to further strengthen the alliance with Central 
Asian republics which have proved their commitment to the idea 
of unity at the most critical times for Russia. 
<H6>  3. Toward Integration Via Coordination </H6>
  There is an impression that, out of the entire package of 
problems on whose solution the CIS ought to be working, 
attention today is focused only on two aspects: The 
supply of Russian raw materials and fuel to the NIS, and the 
combat involvement of Russian troops under CIS auspices in 
conflicts on the territory of the former USSR. 
  And yet the questions of paramount importance for the 
peaceful period of development -- settling the issue of 
citizens' rights -- are hardly ever on the agenda. The CIS 
today certainly needs an organ capable of coordinating 
humanitarian questions and easing the pressure of state borders 
on the collective and individual rights of citizens of any 
nationality. 
  The CIS collective organs could also coordinate the process 
of reforms. It is hard to revive our economic mechanism while 
different parts of the CIS implement divergent concepts of 
transition to market economy. Like, for example, when the 
Western republics adhere to the genuinely sensible limitations 
of initial privatization while Russia is engaged exclusively in 
"macroprivatization" -- the destatization of harbors and 
airports, oil and gold fields, and industrial giants. 
  The problems that could be resolved only within the 
framework 
of a single socioeconomic area are considerably more numerous 
than it might appear at first glance. The problem of 
refugees whose solution presupposes, specifically, a system 
of sanctions against republics whose 
"democratization-liberation" policy poses a threat to people's 
survival and to the guarantees of their elementary rights. As 
well as the provision of complete secondary and higher 
education in the native language, together with questions 
concerning the pension provision for people who worked in 
the USSR and are now living in CIS states. 
  No matter how sad this may be to admit, but the initially 
built-in disintegrational factor still dominates the concept of 
the CIS two years later. The reason is the lack of a 
concept of unification, of a backbone around which a real, as 
opposed to a nominal, "community" may be developed. 
Russian and European experience alike show that a real and 
dynamic foundation for the re-creation of a single humanitarian, 
economic, and defense area can be provided by the 
interests of ethnic minorities detached from their nucleus, 
including the largest among them -- the Russian. A concept 
capable of switching the CIS to the tracks of constructive 
collaboration will emerge only when we abandon the demagoguery 
abour Russian chauvinism and all the other tags recently 
attached to the nation which succeeded in really rallying the 
peoples on one-sixth of the Earth's surface. 
<H6>  4. Problems of Migration </H6>
  Without a forecast of the true extent of migration, it is 
difficult to determine what financial resources will be required 
to compensate refugees and forced migrants for the damage they 
have suffered and to provide facilities for new settlers, the 
number of jobs that will have to be created for them, the real 
burden that will be imposed on the social infrastructure at 
places where migrants will concentrate, and so on. 
  The return of Russians from former USSR republics and the 
migration of representatives of non-Russian peoples to Russia 
began long before interethnic tension reached the stage of 
open conflicts and became a bargaining chip in political 
struggle. Even back in 1979-1988, the positive balance of 
the migration to Russia by Russians who had formerly actively 
resettled in other republics was in excess of 300,000. 
  The growth of the scale of migration was also affected by 
the 
outflow of "nonindigenous" peoples from regions where 
non-Russian titular ethnic groups had concentrated in Russia 
itself -- the Northern Caucasus, the Volga Valley, the 
Siberian-Transbaykal region, and the northern belt of the 
Federation. 
  In essence, these regions showed the selfsame symptoms of 
discrimination against representatives of nontitular ethnic 
groups as in nearby foreign countries. 
  Among the adverse consequences of mass migration, really 
great importance attaches to the growth of social 
stress. There is a significant deterioration of the social 
awareness of migrants themselves, who have lost their former 
status and, quite often, the prospects of social success. There 
is also dissatisfaction among the residents of towns and 
villages where they live. 
  Unfortunately, the help given to forced migrants or refugees 
by the local organs of power and population is clearly 
inadequate. The attempts by migrants to acquire a social niche 
in the new localities come up against serious objective 
difficulties. The level of social tension has increased 
wherever refugees are concentrated as soon as they have 
appeared. This is noted both by the migrants themselves and by 
local residents. 
  The social and psychological atmosphere in which refugees 
find themselves is also indicated by the results of a poll of 
the population in 13 Russian Federation regions. When asked 
"What policy do you support?", the answers were distributed as 
follows (as percentage of the number polled): 
  Accept citizens of all former USSR republics regardless of 
their nationality -- 36 percent 
  Accept only Russians by descent -- 51 percent 
  Do not accept anyone -- 11 percent 
  Did not answer -- 2 percent 
  One out of every 10 persons polled is against the 
acceptance of migrants, while one-half of those polled are 
inclined toward dividing refugees and migrants into "our people" 
and "foreigners." These stereotypes of mass and individual 
awareness cannot be ignored. They were graphically demonstrated 
in practice in Saratov and Volgograd Oblasts during the 
discussion of the question of settling Germans there and 
re-creating a German autonomous formation in the Volga Valley. 
  The local population's unwelcoming attitudes toward migrants 
will intensify as the shortages of foodstuffs, housing, 
and so on worsen. This can already be seen at present. 
  Respondents of the all-Russia poll were asked: "What will be 
your attitude if refugees which may appear in your region are 
allocated housing out of turn, are given jobs, and are helped 
with money from the state budget?" The answers were as follows:

  The acuteness of the housing problem in Russia, where the 
number of people waiting for housing is in excess of 9 million, 
was clearly manifested by the fact that less than one-third of 
those polled are inclined to support the policy of priority 
housing allocation for forced migrants. 
  This indicator of potential conflict rises 
sharply when the ethnic composition of migrants does not 
coincide with the titular ethnic group at their new place of 
settlement. In other words, mass migration is fraught 
with a "chain reaction" of interethnic conflicts, the symptoms 
of which can already be seen. Specifically, they take the 
form of growing nationalism and attempts to initiate pogroms 
against people of different nationality or religion in oblasts 
which have taken in large numbers of migrants. 
  There are different forecasts about the migration of 
Russians 
to Russia. The number of potential migrants could include 
virtually all 25 million Russians living in nearby 
foreign countries. Some 4-5 million people in the next 
5-10 years -- this is the maximum size of the migration flows 
which could be prompted either in the event of exacerbation of 
interethnic relations or as a result of the start of combat 
operations on the territories of former Union republics. 
  According to Federal Migration Service data, over the next 
12-18 months we can expect between 650,000 and 1.2 million 
people to arrive in Russia from nearby foreign 
countries: 300,000-400,000 from Ukraine and Belarus, 
250,000-550,000 from Central Asia and Kazakhstan, 40,000-100,000 
from the Transcaucasus, and 25,000-45,000 from the Baltic 
countries. 
  The mass migration of Russians from Ukraine and Belarus to 
Russia and of Ukrainians and Belarusians to Ukraine and Belarus 
can happen only in the event of military conflict between 
the republics. Although in Ukraine, for example, there are 
even now forces prepared to instigate this process. 
  The situation with Russians is even more complex 
in Kazakhstan, where there are about 6 million of them 
(one-fourth of all Russians living in former Union republics 
outside the Russian Federation). There is a large flow of 
Russian migrants from kazakhstan. This trend is growing. 
  It is possible to forecast three avenues and, 
consequently, three periods of the migration of Russians to 
Russia. An active migration of first- and 
second-generation Russians is expected from Turkmenistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. 
Between 30 and 50 percent of the Russian-speaking 
population intend to emigrate from there. 
  Some 18-20 percent of Russians intend to leave Latvia, 
Estonia, Lithuania, Moldova, Georgia, and Armenia. Up to 
11 percent of Russians express desire to leave Ukraine and 
Belarus. 
  According to poll results, about 2 million Russians 
intend to move to Russia today because they feel persecuted 
along national and linguistic lines. 
  Both now and in the future the forced migrants from Union 
republics are mainly engineers, technicians, skilled industrial 
workers, teachers, and physicians, in other words strictly urban 
people who will be unable to settle in the large cities because 
of residence permit problems. They cannot buy or build housing 
in towns because the law forbids it. This is why many of 
them perceive their situation as hopeless. There is hardly any 
need to comment on the political views of present and future 
migrants or their attitude toward the new political and economic 
realities which have turned them into outcasts. 
  There are six specialized and transit reception points for 
refugees open and functioning on Russia's territory. There is 
discussion of the possibility of setting up similar points and 
regional migration services in every oblast. 
  The Committee for Migration Affairs proceeds from the 
premise 
that this is not only a calamity but also, to a certain extent, 
a benefit for Russia. The government is beginning to realize 
that the reception and settlement of migrants will require large 
investments, but those returning to their historical motherland 
are almost the most enterprising, skilled, and industrious part 
of the nation. 
  A Public Committee for the Settlement of Forced Migrants is 
functioning. In just under one year it has "processed" about 1 
million persons and has helped 20,000. 
  But the work on migration problems is fragmented, there 
is no coordination at state level, and resources are being 
wasted. Many categories of migrants have found themselves 
altogether outside the sphere of state regulation. It is 
clear that the Federal Migration Service will not be able 
to cope with the swelling flood of migrants on its own. 
  The situation calls for immediate action. There is need for 
a package of interlinked measures and coordinated actions by 
state migration organs, the Foreign Ministry, the Committee for 
Emergency Situations, the State Committee for Nationalities 
Affairs, and the public organizations. In other words, there is 
need for a nationwide federal program for help to our 
compatriots. Furthermore, this program must be given 
top priority from the material-financial and the 
political-diplomatic points of view alike. 
  The state's policy toward migration needs more than just 
serious amendments. Bearing in mind the provisional qualitative 
and quantitative appraisals of migration and its sociopolitical 
consequences, we are talking about actually elaborating a 
new, all-embracing, and effective migration policy. Its 
main actions and principles would appear to be the following: 
Help for forced migrants must include not only the provision of 
compensation, land, credits, and employment information, but 
also the lifting of all restrictions on residence permits and 
the choice of place of residence. Migrants, together with all 
other Russians, must be given equal rights to buy and sell at 
Russia's housing and labor markets and not be made hostages of 
"supreme state interests." 
  The swelling or subsidence of migration processes will 
depend, at the very least, on political decisions by the 
leaderships of various republics about protecting the rights of 
ethnic minorities and the pace at which the "indigenization" of 
the republics' populations proceeds. 
  There must be no delay in elaborating more precise 
guidelines in mutual relations between former USSR republics and 
components of the Russian Federation. 
  It is obvious, without any additional research, that today 
we 
need: 
  -- to conclude between the sovereign states -- former USSR 
republcis -- a treaty on the rights of ethnic minorities 
to work, education, and cultural and national autonomy; 
  -- to do some additional work on the Federation Treaty 
between components of the Russian Federation. It is necessary 
to define and unconditionally ensure economic, social, and 
political guarantees for refugees, victims of interethnic 
conflicts, and forced migrants regardless of their nationality, 
religion, ideological beliefs, or the regions whence they have 
arrived; 
  -- to conclude between the Russian Federation components an 
agreement defining the amount, procedure, and mechanism of 
compensation for refugees and forced migrants and having the 
damage they have suffered compensated either by the responsible 
side or from the state budget; 
  -- to legislatively guarantee the representation of 
different ethnic groups in the Russian Federation at the organs 
of power, taking more effectively and more deeply into 
account the ethnic problems and interests of different peoples 
in economic, social, and cultural policy; 
  -- to constitutionally define the diverse national 
movements reflecting the interests of various ethnic groups, 
including those without their own national and ethnic formations 
on the Russian Federation's territory; 
  -- to proclaim a moratorium on the transformation of 
the territories of former autonomous formations whose objective 
is to reshape existing borders 
  -- to implement measures to equalize and raise living 
standards in different national-state formations; 
  -- to elaborate unified programs for the socioeconomic 
and cultural development of regions where different ethnic 
groups are concentrated (the Northern Caucasus, the Volga 
Valley, the Northwestern region, and others); 
  -- to define the geography of a better resettlement of 
repatriates and the amount of resources needed for providing the 
necessary facilities; 
  -- to prevent the excessive concentration of migrants 
in individual regions of the country like, for example, 
Stavropol and Krasnodar Krays and some others; 
  -- to promote an improvement of the psychological 
climate surrounding migrants and to define sanctions 
against organs of power and citizens fanning enmity between the 
local population and migrants; 
  -- to make much better use of the professional 
potential of workers and engineers from among forced migrants 
and refugees; 
  -- to organize the retraining of migrants with a view 
to reducing the army of forced unemployed; 
  -- to encourage entrepreneurial activity by 
migrants (temporary benefits in the taxation of small 
business); 
  -- to form special budget and extrabudget funds for the 
effective resolution of these and other emerging problems. 
  The republics' parliaments must revisit the problem of the 
Russian language's status. It must be given the status of state 
language wherever it is used by the majority of the population. 
This approach is in line with international norms and would 
obviously promote the further harmonization of interstate 
relations. 
  There also is a pressing need to conclude interstate 
agreements on human rights with all former Union republics. 
Monitoring of their fulfillment could be carried out at both 
state and public level. The status of economic relations with 
various states must depend on the observance of these 
international agreements and the principles of international law. 
  It is expedient to support the creation of trade and 
economic 
centers in Moscow and Russia for Russian communities abroad, to 
assist Russians in enrolling in higher and specialized 
educational establishments, and to sponsor and support Russian 
schools and the Russian language and culture. 
  All peoples of Russia are fraternal for the Russian people. 
Our people desire to live in peace and friendship with the 
peoples of all other countries. Our concern about the fate of 
Russian people is not aimed against other peoples and states. 
  Russia's path leads through peaceful solution of 
problems and mutual cooperation to universal and just peace. 
<H6>  5. Problems of Russia's Economic Mutual Relations with CIS 
Countries </H6>
  The rate of the slump in production and inflation 
continued to grow in CIS countries in 1993. The government of 
not a single CIS republic succeeded in halting the process of 
economic decline. On the whole, the total volume of industrial 
production in the Community was reduced by 20 percent in 
comparable prices over the year. 
  The "shared" slump was not affected to any large degree by 
the different nature and pace of economic reforms in different 
countries. In the conditions of "transparent" borders and 
unified money circulation within the ruble zone, the lack of 
coordination in economic activity hurts the finances of 
"neighbors." The imbalance in reciprocal deliveries has already 
evolved into an imbalance in the international settlements of 
CIS countries. 
  On the whole, it is possible to agree with the opinion of 
World Bank associates K. Mikhalopoulos and D. Tarr: "The 
situation as regards trade and payments in the former Soviet 
republics was distinguished by chaos, which reflected the 
existence of a series of problems. The disorganization of the 
credit, monetary, and payments system was at the heart of these 
problems. 
  "The main problem is that the reduction of interrepublic 
trade will promote the further decline of the volume of output 
and incomes. Therefore, political strategists will have to 
create mechanisms for the transition period which would 
help the new states to restore the effective flow of trade and 
avoid further serious breaches of this flow in the short term, 
supporting in the longer term the restructuring of their economy 
and its integration in the world economy." After all, the 
sharply increased dependence of each CIS state on the external 
markets becomes a condition for the functioning of their 
economies. As a matter of fact, these realities are only 
just being realized and taken into account in the economic 
practice of CIS countries. 
  On the whole, as 1993 has shown, the stepping up of the 
economies' "external" dependence will continue. This dependence 
will be most graphically demonstrated in the sphere of 
satisfying the CIS countries' energy needs. 
  "Sovereignization" has undermined Russia's potential as 
energy supplier. Let us add for objectivity's sake that 
cutbacks in the rate of oil extraction started four years ago. 
According to estimates by Russia's Ministry of Fuel and Energy, 
oil extraction dropped by a further 50 million tonnes in 1993, 
in other words will reach only 340 million tonnes. If this pace 
of reducing the extraction of black gold is maintained, then in 
the very near future the fuel and energy complex will be working 
to meet only Russia's own needs, which today stand at 240 
million tonnes. 
  Oil exports increased more than threefold, but 
this increase was accompanied by a reduction of deliveries to 
CIS countries by an average of 50 percent. In this context, 
Russia could be suspected of waging a "cold war" against Ukraine 
and the Baltic and Central Asian countries. But such an 
approach would be based on inertia of thought. Facts prove 
whether it is advantageous for Russia to deliver oil products to 
the former republics. Russia delivered its output (primarily 
raw materials which are competitive on the world markets) to 
nearby foreign countries at prices equivalent on average to 
30-40 percent of world prices, and acquired from nearby foreign 
countries output at prices equivalent to about 70 percent of 
world prices. Moreover, in many instances Russia often failed 
to receive any payment at all for its exports. For example, 
having delivered to nearby foreign countries about 50 million 
tonnes of oil to a total value of $6.5 billion, by way of 
payment it received machinery and equipment worth only $700 
million. 
  But Russia's external economic dependence was also 
increasing and has almost trebled, having reached 14-15 percent 
of GNP. This is more than in India and Japan, let alone the 
United States. External dependence demands additional foreign 
currency resources for the economy's functioning. Naturally, 
some of the sources are gas, oil, and oil products. 
  Coming back to the idea of "cold war" against Ukraine, it is 
appropriate to recall one contentious problem: Last year 
Ukraine sold abroad, at world prices of course, 8 million 
tonnes out of the 33.5 million tonnes of oil it had received 
from Russia. According to some estimates, the amount earned 
from this deal is equal to, for example, the costs of building a 
major international airport at, say, Novosibirsk, capable of 
earning an annual profit to the tune of $700-800 million. 
  Russia's economy today bears the heavy burden of additional 
export and import expenditures associated with transit charges 
for crossing the territory of neighboring states, but the safety 
of goods in transit is not guaranteed, not even by Ukraine. Of 
course, the press cites numerous facts about Russia's debt to 
other CIS republics, but the overall balance is this: 
Russia had a positive balance of about R750 billion. 
Similar trends will also persist next year, even though the 
government has taken a series of measures to put an end to 
nonpayments. 
  Appraising the situation in Russia's economic ties with 
nearby foreign countries, it can be said that 1993 saw the 
"start of sobering up from euphoria" in the CIS. It is, of 
course, premature to conclude that the balance of centrifugal 
and centripetal forces shows that the latter are stronger. But 
this awakening, coupled with disappointments and lost illusions, 
has also brought in a certain proportion of common sense. 
<H3>  Section V: V. The Creation of Favorable International 
Conditions for the Implementation of Reforms in Russia </H3>
<H6>  1. Existing Realities </H6>
  In order to elaborate Russia's strategy in the sphere of 
national and international security, it is necessary to analyze 
the position it occupies in the world and the essence of its 
international interests as determined by the profound 
changes of the last few years. There are four main factors 
making up the system of Russia's policy guidelines at least for 
the 1990's. 
  THE FIRST is the fact that the Soviet Union has 
disintegrated, thus putting an end to the world's bipolar 
structure. There has been a radical change in the 
geopolitical role played by Russia, which has become a component 
of the world community. Russia has inherited from the USSR 75 
percent of its territory, 51 percent of its population, 60 
percent of fixed production assets (in terms of value), and 76 
percent of enterprises producing means of production. It 
accounts for 90 percent of oil extraction, 73 percent of gas 
extraction, 63 percent of electricity generation, 80 percent of 
crude oil exports, and almost 100 percent of natural gas 
exports. It procuces more than one-half of the GNP produced in 
the USSR in 1990. 
  But Russia is not just smaller than the USSR in size -- it 
has found itself in a fundamentally new environment to the west 
and to the south, where the former Soviet republics lie. 
Furthermore, some of them have been profoundly hit by domestic 
instability, they are extremely susceptible to external 
influences, and are in conflict with one another. The paradox 
is that formally these are foreign countries as far as Russia is 
concerned. In fact, however, they remain inseparably linked 
with it both by their common historical past and by the 
multitude of living economic, cultural, social, and 
psychological bonds. 
  THE SECOND FACTOR. Russia is experiencing a most 
profound economic and sociopolitical crisis whose solution still 
lies far into the future. At the same time, by dint of its 
size and of the political and strategic legacy inherited from 
the USSR, Russia remains one of the world's leading countries. 
  It will not be at all simple for Russia to find its place in 
the international arena. 
  Russia's new leadership bears the burden of a difficult twin 
task: To create a new system of foreign and domestic policy, 
turing it into a catalyst of radical market reforms, and at the 
same time to overcome the burden of problems inherited from the 
past. 
  THE THIRD FACTOR. The Russian Federation as a 
genuinely democratic republic. Russia no longer has a 
planned economy, but it still has not acquired a market economy. 
The unitary state has collapsed, but the best possible balance 
between central and local power has yet to be found. 
Furthermore, the Federation today faces the threat of disunity 
and fragmentation into "separate principalities." 
  Finally, THE FOURTH FACTOR is associated with 
changes in the surrounding world. 
  We are witnessing the onset of a more traditional but 
also a much more complex time of multilateral diplomacy, 
intricacy of contradictions and coincidence of states' 
interests, shifting coalitions, and limited political 
goals. The threat of a universal war is declining, but 
there is a growing danger of local conflicts fraught with 
escalation of combat operations in various regions. 
  All this indicates that the maintenance of peace in the 
future will require active work by international and regional 
organizations to ensure collective security, as well as joint 
peacemaking actions by the powers. 
  Proceeding from what has been said above, what are our 
fatherland's main foreign policy priorities? 
  At present Russia has three interlinked supreme foreign 
policy priorities. 
  The first is to ensure political stability in the 
country, prevent war, and settle armed conflicts on the 
territory of the former USSR, both within and between individual 
republics, primarily by political means. 
  The second is to prevent the emergence of 
hegemonic powers in Europe, South Asia, and the Far East which 
would strive to extend their influence to regions in the former 
USSR where the situation is unstable. 
  The third is to preserve the status of a great 
power occupying a special position in the world's geostrategic 
structure. 
  The main point for Russia is to ensure political stability 
and to prevent and settle conflicts across the former USSR. 
Should instability and potential conflicts there grow further, 
this would threaten both Russia's territorial integrity and its 
economic and democratic reforms. The maximum (desirable) task 
is economic and political integration on the basis of equal 
rights, voluntariness, and mutual advantage for CIS countries, 
primarily Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. If the 
desirable proves unattainable, then the vitally important 
minimum task for the Russian Federation is to prevent the 
creation of a hostile coalition. 
  Russia is proceeding from the premise that the Helsinki 
principle of the inviolability of borders must provide the 
foundation of mutual relations between the former USSR 
republics. Any revision of borders would be permissible 
only via peaceful talks. Sanctions, including the use of force, 
would be permissible only in the event that a country's 
leadership pursues a policy of genocide toward ethnic 
minorities, and this is recognized and defined as genocide under 
UN rules. 
  Germany, Turkey, Japan, China, and others are potentially 
capable of posing the threat of regional hegemony to Russia in 
the 1990's. Of course, nobody is accusing the aforementioned 
countries of currently acting along this avenue. But a sober 
forecast of the shifting balance of forces and of the 
geopolitical situation makes it mandatory to consider the 
possibility of changes in their policy which are not even 
contemplated at present. 
  The United States is Russia's most important partner in 
countering regional hegemony. The remaining centers of power 
are still not capable of really influencing the situation in hot 
spots, be they in the Near East, Angola or Yugoslavia, the 
Caucasus or Afghanistan. 
  Russia is planning to pursue this priority using different 
methods in different regions. In Europe, for example, the 
guarantee for preventing any military-political expansionism by 
leading states is perceived in the development of European 
integration and the stregnthening of the CSCE as an organ of 
collective security and collective response to any potential 
aggressor. 
  In the past, the USSR used to advocate the simultaneous 
disbandment of NATO and the Warsaw Pact Organization [WPO]. Not 
only has the NATO bloc not been disbanded, but is is actually 
building up its might. This organization cannot be smoothly 
transformed into a European security structure. We believe that 
a stabilization of the situation in the Russian Federation on 
the basis of market economy and the development of democracy 
will create the need for a fundamentally new international 
organization, possibly on the basis of utilizing and developing 
elements from the structures of the EC, the West European Union, 
NATO, and the CSCE and with participation by Russia, the United 
States, and Canada. 
  The Russian Federation's policy in Asia Minor [Malaya Aziya] 
and South Asia could take the form of direct, including 
military, resistance to outside interference by agreement with 
the republics under threat. The nature of the multipolar world 
adjoining the Transcaucasus is much more complex. Russia's 
partner here is objectively Iran, and Turkey in South Asia. The 
maintenance of a certain balance between them is in line with 
Russia's interests, despite the fact that the West would 
obviously give preference to Turkey as a member of NATO. 
  The maintenance of the U.S. military presence in Japan is 
in line with Russia's interests in the Far East. In the event 
of withdrawal by the United States and of China's headlong 
economic and military strengthening, Japan's reaction could only 
take the form of accelerated remilitarization. A clash between 
the two huge powers over Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Southeast 
Asia could also involve Russia in the conflict. 
  Any sharp change of the balance of forces in favor of China 
or Japan and the emergence of hegemonic aspirations in one of 
the two powers could pose a direct threat to Russia's Far East. 
  It is obvious that Russia needs to retain its positions as a 
great world power. This means Russia's participation in the UN 
Security Council as one of its permanent members and its role in 
other international structures. It also means participating, as 
far as possible, in the maintenance of peace and the repulsion 
of aggression, including along the lines of peacemaking forces 
within the framework of the Security Council, the CSCE, and 
others, and genocide-terminating operations sanctioned by the 
United Nations and regional international organizations. 
  Russia advocates active prevention of the proliferation of 
nuclear and other mass destruction weapons, a tougher regime to 
control the deliveries of missiles and missile technology, and 
the elaboration of agreed quotas and restructions on the arms 
trade as a whole. 
  The problem of Russia's military-strategic parity with the 
United States deserves special mention. It will be necessary to 
continue the mutual balanced reduction of Russian Federation and 
U.S. strategic nuclear forces on new terms. Here we need a 
transition from mutual deterrence through the ability to deliver 
a crushing counterstrike on the aggressor to joint management of 
strategic stability. This is why talks will constitute the 
sphere of special mutual relations and mutual interests between 
Russia and the United States. 
<H6>  2. National Interests </H6>
  Let us examine Russia's specific national 
interests from the viewpoint of international security. 
  Retaining the great-power status. This is 
Russia's natural right, vested in it thanks to its economic 
potential, the successes it has achieved in science, culture, 
military might, and so on. 
  Guaranteeing Eurasian stability. Whenever the 
Eurasian balance of forces has been disrupted, Russia has 
traditionally been the main victim. 
  Therefore the desire by any one state or coalition of 
states to dominate Eurasia will not be in Russia's fundamental 
national interests. 
  Nor can our interests be served by attempts to isolate 
Russia, squeeze it out of the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, 
reduce foreign economic commodity turnover, change its 
structure, and so on. 
  Ensuring political and economic stability in states all 
along Russia's borders. This is a key interest for any 
power, but the problem of preventing the emergence of conflict 
zones along the borders is especially important for Russia, 
which has the world's longest land border, and with its complex 
relations with neighbors which are rooted in the past. 
  Parrying and preventing potential threats. The 
world in which we are living now is a world of power 
partnerships and power rivalry within the framework of rigid 
durable structures. 
  Despite the changes which have occurred in the last few 
years 
-- especially the end of the "Cold War," the improvement of 
relations between the United States and Russia, the 
rapprochement to a certain extent between East and West Europe, 
and so on -- more sophisticated principles of power balance and 
power collaboration still remain the foundation of contemporary 
international relations. Indicators like economic, scientific, 
and intellectual potential play a greater role in the system of 
state might. But the military component still 
dominates the structure of interstate power. 
  Real military nuclear-missile confrontation on a global 
level 
remains only between Russia and the United States for the time 
being. The continuation of nuclear confrontation between our 
countries is objective and inevitable in the foreseeable future. 
Furthermore, the growing nuclear-missile potential of the PRC 
and West Europe also poses a military threat for Russia in the 
1990's. 
  Finally, Russia's cultural security and its 
originality are threatened by the West's liberal individualistic 
ideology, to the exent that collectivism still dominates 
awareness and thinking and today's Russian reality. 
  At the regional level it is necessary to proceed from the 
fact that, in the event of exacerbation of the domestic crisis, 
virtually all of Russia's neighbors could potentially raise 
sundry territorial claims. Although the economic, cultural, and 
other categories of security are not obviously linked with 
military security, many armed conflicts have started with 
mistakes committed in nonmilitary spheres. Therefore the 
prevention of threats to Russia must be actively waged across 
the entire spectrum. This is Russia's main national interest. 
<H6>  3. Foreign Policy </H6>
  We deem it important to single out the following basic 
objectives and guidelines for defining the strategy of Russia's 
development and behavior in the world community of peoples. 
  The Russian Federation is constantly present in the arena of 
world political life. It is a different matter that Russia's 
domestic situation and its geopolitical environment at present 
do not favor the pursuit of an active global policy, and its 
regional interests will call for the greatest of efforts in the 
next few years. The possession of a mighty nuclear potential 
does not change the situation, either. For the first time in 
many years, our country is in a situation whereby it does not 
face any definite or in any way significant external military 
threat. 
  Territorial disputes involve countries which will certainly 
not resort to military force for their solution provided, of 
course, Russia remains a united state. All this is 
exceptionally advantageous for concentrating the country's 
efforts on the solution of the domestic tasks concerning radical 
transformations and the problems constantly emerging in mutual 
relations with CIS countries. 
  Relations with Germany, at least over the last two 
centuries, have occupied a central position among the 
priorities of Russia's foreign policy. But the experience 
of the 20th century, with its two world wars, the cruel battles 
without precedent in history, and the huge sacrifices and 
destruction suffered by both sides, would seem to indicate the 
irreconcilability of the two countries' interests. True enough, 
the period between the two wars produced a whole range of 
mutually advantageous economic -- and even military-technical -- 
cooperation. That was the period when the average German 
realized that the situation in Germany develops well whenever 
its relations with Russia are good. 
  Russia needs a new East Asian and Pacific policy. 
Its backbone must be provided by relations with China as its 
main partner not only in the region but also in the broader 
global context. The positive potential in the history of 
Russian-Chinese relations is much more powerful than the 
negative. Both countries' interest in the preservation of each 
other's integrity is a most important factor of Russian-Chinese 
collaboration. The complexity of the problem of the Korean 
state's unification also prompts China and Russia alike in the 
direction of a unified approach toward maintaining the 
immutability of World War II's results in the Far East. Both 
countries are reliable partners in the cause of unconditionally 
observing the Yalta Conference decisions on the Far East, in 
other words confirming Outer Mongolia's status and the fact that 
the Kuril Islands and South Sakhalin belong to Russia. 
  It is possible to define the following long-term 
interests of the security of the Russian Federation: 
  -- Preserving general stability in the world, capable of 
resisting local armed conflicts. 
  -- Eliminating the seats of tension close to the Russian 
Federation's territory and fraught with the explosion of armed 
conflicts. 
  -- Maintaining normal relations with all states, primarily 
with European and Asian states, and elevating these relations to 
the level of partnership. 
  -- Strengthening and developing the peacemaking potential of 
the United Nations, the CSCE, and others with a view to the 
earliest possible political settlement of conflicts threatening 
to evolve into armed clashes. 
  -- The further deepening of the process of disarmament 
offers 
an opportunity to reduce the Russian Armed Forces to the minimum 
level necessary to ensure external security and honor the 
Russian Federation's international commitments. 
  -- Restoring the Russian Federation's international prestige 
as the legitimate heir of the former Soviet Union and a great 
power recognized by the world community. 
  The fewer the forces being diverted externally, the faster 
will the establishment of Russian statehood proceed. In the 
conditions of the world's deepening interdependence, this can 
happen if the international situation remains stable for a 
number of years on end, without armed conflicts capable of 
shaking this stability. 
  At the same time, it is impossible to rule out the 
probability of local conflicts flaring in regions where there 
are confrontations along religious, nationalist, or other lines. 
Unfortunately, these regions lie along the former Soviet Union's 
southwestern and southern borders. 
  It is in Russia's interests to eliminate any local conflicts 
developing in the world by political means and as swiftly as 
possible. This is why the Russian Federation must support by 
all possible means the political peacemaking potential of the 
United Nations, the CSCE, and other international organizations. 
  It is in our interests to follow, jointly with the other 
powers, the path of deeper reductions of armaments and armed 
forces, guided by the principle of sufficiency for defense. 
Sensible reductions of Russia's Armed Forces and armaments will 
not only ease the economic burden but will also make it possible 
to utilize the high technological potential of defense 
enterprises for the Russian economy's recovery. When 
determining the size of the armed forces Russia needs, it is 
also necessary to consider its commitments for the maintenance 
of universal peace. 
  Russia's medium-term interests include normalizing 
and stabilizing both its domestic situation and the situation in 
its immediate environment -- the CIS countries, Yugoslavia, and 
Afghanistan. They include: 
  -- Normalizing and stabilizing relations with CIS countries, 
reaching agreement with them both on the coordination of common 
policy and on specific actions in the sphere of mutual security. 
  -- Elaborating and introducing a system of collaboration 
with 
NATO countries, strengthening ties between CIS countries in the 
defense sphere. 
  -- Achieving an accord, acceptable to Russia, on settling 
the 
question concerning the southern islands of the Kurils chain so 
as to lift the barrier to the development of relations of 
cooperation with Japan. 
  -- Agreement with the PRC, enshrining the fact that the 
sides 
have no reciprocal territorial claims. 
  -- Normalizing relations with the Afghanistan-Pakistan-Iran 
triangle with a view to elaborating an agreement on mutual 
recognition, inviolability of borders, and establishment of 
cooperation, including in the defense sphere, but without in any 
way infringing upon the close relations with India. 
  -- Establishing normal relations with all states which will 
emerge in the place of the former Yugoslav Federation. 
  Special attention must be given to conflicts flaring both 
within and between CIS countries, including armed conflicts. 
  There is no time to be lost, therefore the task of 
normalizing and stabilizing relations with the CIS countries 
cannot be put off and must be included among medium-term tasks. 
  Awareness of the community of interests in ensuring 
collective defense will be an important factor of the 
development of centripetal forces. 
  The next two to four years will be especially important 
for the Russian Federation's future. It will be virtually 
impossible to resolve the tasks of economic revival without 
eliminating conflicts and their potential sources. Proceeding 
from this premise, it is possible to define the following 
short-term interests of the Russian Federation's 
security: 
  -- Terminating interethnic conflicts in regions adjoining 
the 
Russian Federation's Caucasian border. 
  -- Reaching accord on an economic area within the framework 
of the former Soviet Union and the appropriate border regime 
between states. 
  -- Implementing the accord concerning the state border 
security regime along the entire perimeter of the former Soviet 
Union. 
  -- Reaching accord between the Russian Federation and other 
CIS states on questions of protection against nuclear attack and 
of strengthening the international regime for the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  The sobering up which is occurring in CIS states in the 
economic sphere and the growing awareness of the consequences of 
the breakdown of economic ties indicate that this avenue could 
successfully serve the solution of the tasks of ensuring 
Russia's general safety and security. It is obvious that, in 
order to organize a single economic area, it will become 
necessary to solve the questions of border regimes both between 
CIS states and along the former Soviet Union's perimeter. 
Unless this is done, it will be impossible to avoid economic 
sabotage, close the external borders (otherwise the Russian 
Federation's borders will also be penetrable), halt the rise of 
crime and especially of organized crime, and so on. 
  The most vulnerable sector of the Russian Federation's 
border lies in the regions of interethnic conflicts. It is 
therefore in our national interests to extinguish all 
interethnic conflicts along the Caucasian border and achieve the 
restoration of peace and tranquility there. 
  In today's conditions it is impossible to ensure the 
security 
of borders between CIS countries without help from the Armed 
Forces. From the political viewpoint it would be 
disadvantageous for Russia to become the first to introduce 
armed protection of borders with CIS countries. It would 
therefore be expedient to begin with a general accord on border 
regime: What will be the nature of borders, the extent to which 
Armed Forces will participate in their protection, and so on. 
  It would be expedient if the new states were to use their 
own 
forces to protect their borders. This applies especially to the 
southern borders. This section of the border has been closed in 
Russia's interests, but it is unfair for Russia alone to bear 
the responsibility and costs. 
  It is in the CIS states' national interests to receive 
guarantees against nuclear attack, the likelihood of which 
has to be taken into consideration in today's world. The 
Russian Federation is in a position to back up such guarantees. 
At the same time, however, we are interested in having all CIS 
states join the regime of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  The nuclear powers today are interested in strengthening the 
regime of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and ruling out any 
access to them for adventurist and irresponsible politicians. 
Furthermore, joint actions by all nuclear powers in this sphere 
promote the development of relations of trust between them, 
which is also in line with the Russian Federation's interests. 
<H6>  4. Threats to the Preservation of State Stability and 
Security. Measures for Their Neutralization. </H6>
  The idea of "superpower status," based upon unrestrained 
militarization, was the primary cause of the Soviet Union's 
defeat in the "cold war" and its subsequent collapse. The 
Russian Federation's return to such a policy would pose the 
greatest threat to its statehood and security. 
  As for the external threat, its nature has changed. Whereas 
previously the armed threat originated primarily from the West, 
there is no worry originating from this direction at present. 
At the same time, it would be premature to rule out military 
danger from the southwest in the event of any protraction of the 
armed conflict in Yugoslavia, capable of involving neighboring 
countries. The conflict's religious aspect is especially 
dangerous, because we are talking about three faiths with 
adherents in many countries, including the Russian Federation. 
  Romania could also produce a seat of tension, or rather an 
outburst of Romanian great power chauvinism which has not 
abandoned the idea of re-creating a "Greater Romania" 
incorporating Moldova and the Dniester Region lands. Should 
this happen, any such actions by Romania will inevitably prompt 
reactions in Bulgaria (the Dobruja question), in Hungary 
(Transylvania), and even in Russia (the Dniester Republic). 
  A dangerous seat of military threat could develop in the 
region adjoining the Caucasian and Central Asian CIS states. 
Islamic fundamentalism comprises mighty forces and, in today's 
situation, it nurtures the hope of creating a bloc of Islamic 
states under the auspices of Pakistan, Iran, and -- less likely 
-- Turkey. Such a bloc will inevitably try to include in its 
orbit Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. It 
cannot be ruled out that it might attempt to influence 
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan as well. 
  When evaluating this danger, it is necessary to take into 
account the changed nature of mutual relations within the 
triangle of the Russian Federation, the Arab countries, and 
Israel. The normalization of the Russian Federation's relations 
with Israel and the latter's "sustenance" through emigration 
from Russia, coupled with the fact that the Russian Federation 
has to a certain extent distanced itself from Libya and Iraq, 
are providing grounds for growing anti-Russian feelings in the 
Arab countries. 
  Finally, it would be a mistake to completely rule out the 
possibility of military pressure from the southeast or from 
China. Should this happen, demographic pressure will not be the 
only factor in operation. 
  Elaboration of national consensus on foreign policy 
questions. 
  It is an axiom that a state is strong through the unity of 
its citizens' positions. States have overcome the difficulties 
facing them most easily when there has been a community of views 
among their citizens. 
  It is important to make the majority of the population aware 
of the benefits and even the inevitability of Russia's present 
course of friendly relations with all countries while reducing 
the volume of its external commitments, primarily those imposed 
in the past for ideological reasons. 
  Continuation of the course of achieving accord on 
disarmament questions. 
  The widespread differences of opinion on whether the course 
of achieving accords on further reductions of armed forces and 
armaments is advantageous for Russia are, to a certain extent, 
harmful to the elaboration of national consensus on foreign 
policy questions. 
  The time has come to abandon propaganda declarations like 
the 
complete ban and withdrawal of nuclear weapons and to take a 
realistic point of view: A certain quantity of nuclear 
potential is a guarantee of security both for the Russian 
Federation and the CIS states. 
  In addition, it is necessary to aim, both now and in the 
foreseeable future, for a rational regulation of the balance of 
the nuclear missile potentials of Russia, the United States, 
Britain, France, and China, which remains the stabilizing 
foundation of the contemporary world order. This regulation 
ought to be implemented through deep cuts of nuclear arms, the 
strengthening of the regime of nonproliferation of mass 
destruction weapons and missile technologies, and the creation 
of a global system for the world community's protection against 
nuclear missile attack, as proposed by us. 
  The switch to this point of view will facilitate talks with 
the other nuclear powers, including talks on the most rational 
level of nuclear deterrence. 
  It is also important to emphasize that we are hoping for 
understanding of our desire for real nuclear disarmament by 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. We are counting on their 
joining as soon as possible the Treaty on the Nonproliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons as nonnuclear states, and ratifying the START 
I Treaty. Unless this is done, the new treaty's future will be 
problematic. 
  Utilization of NATO's experience. 
  In the process of coordinating defense and military 
organizational development with the CIS countries, it is 
necessary to take into account the experience of both the WPO 
and NATO. The development of political ties in NATO started 
considerably earlier and along a multitude of avenues, including 
ties with the public through the North Atlantic Assembly. 
Consequently, the weak ties within the WPO did not withstand 
the political trials, whereas ties within NATO enabled this 
organization to adapt to changing circumstances. 
  Shifting the provisions of the Fundamentals of Military 
Doctrine to the practical plane. 
  A cementing role in mutual relations with CIS countries in 
the military sphere could be played by shifting the Russian 
Federation's defensive doctrine to the practical plane. Joint 
peacemaking operations by the armed forces are most profitable. 
The need for such operations in the short and medium term will 
remain great in the light of the dangerous instability in a 
series of regions of the former USSR. 
  A considerable role in the maintenance of normal mutual 
relations with nearby foreign countries could be played by the 
pooling of efforts to create a common system of CIS air defense, 
as well as a missile early warning system utilizing missile 
early warning facilities sited in regions of the former USSR 
(the Crimea, Moldova, Belarus, and elsewhere). 
  Transition to mixed manpower acquisition for the Armed 
Forces: on contract basis and under the Law on Military 
Service. 
  The growing complexity of combat equipment raises with 
increasing urgency the question of the Armed Forces' 
professionalization, and this line must be adopted as the main 
line for all military organizational development plans. At the 
same time, it must be borne in mind that the country must train 
a reserve for the event of unforeseen circumstances, and this 
demands the retention of the military service draft on certain 
conditions. 
  Such a dual structure could also prove suitable for the 
Internal Troops: Supplementing the cadre stength from the 
reserve. Such a structure has been successfully functioning for 
a long time now in the United States and Britain. The 
attachment of the reserve to territories would help solve 
political-nationality tasks by creating a sense of confidence 
and self-respect among ethnic groups and nationalities. The 
attainment of this goal will also be promoted by the Cossack 
movement's revival. The inclusion of Cossacks in the general 
reserve will make it possible to consolidate the Cossack 
movement's positive aspects. 
  Final uprooting of wars as means for solving 
international and interethnic conflicts. 
  The development of collaboration between states, the 
elaboration of mutually acceptable positions on key issues, and 
economic and political integration are increasingly becoming the 
predominant trend in international relations. Military force is 
correspondingly and gradually losing its importance as an 
instrument for exerting direct influence. It is becoming 
more of an "ultimate" means for preventing any destabilizing 
development of events and for containing or terminating any 
aggression threatening our national security. 
  This trend is exceptionally important for Russia. At present 
we cannot rely on the Armed Forces alone. They were created 
primarily on the basis of global strongarm confrontation between 
East and West and are not adequately capable of meeting the 
changed spectrum of threats to our national security. The 
current transition period in military organizational development 
is associated with the disintegration of the former USSR Armed 
Forces, the difficulties of establishing new relations between 
the republics in the defense sphere, the complexities of 
material backup for the disarmament and conversion programs, and 
finally the launch of military reform. 
  Russia military strength will, without any doubt, 
continue to serve as an "ultimate" means of deterrence against 
external threats and of ensuring our national security. 
  Taking into account the objective reduction of the role 
played by military strength as the main instrument for 
protecting Russia's national interests, the foremost task now is 
to create a system of collective responsibility by CIS states 
and by states -- former USSR republics -- which have not joined 
the Community for the maintenance of peace in the region, the 
earliest possible resolution of conflicts on its territory, and 
the elimination of seats of armed confrontation. Russia could 
initiate the creation of a Regional Security Council which, in 
its activity, would implement the UN ideas of collective 
security. 
  It is well known that the breeding ground for ethnic 
conflicts is created primarily by violations of human rights, 
the trampling of ethnic minorities' interests, the insulting of 
national dignity, and the most acute problem of protecting the 
rights and interests of the Russian population in nearby foreign 
countries. It is necessary to juridically formulate 
guarantees of legal defense, including the right to hold 
dual citizenship. This would be promoted by the creation 
of an International Commission for the Scrutiny 
[identifikatsiya] of National Legislations. 
  There have been forecasts of the inevitability of ensuring 
collective security by force and using peacemaking forces in hot 
spots on the territory of the former USSR. Without ignoring the 
role of the United Nations and the CSCE, it has to be clearly 
realized that the conflicts are occurring within the zone 
of Russian interests. This is admitted by the parties to 
the conflicts themselves when appealing to none other but 
Russia. Proceeding from this fact, it is necessary for the 
United Nations and the international community to give Russia's 
peacemaking forces a mandate to operate in the region's 
conflicts zones under UN auspices and with the status of "blue 
helmets." 
  One of Russia's most important foreign policy objectives is 
its participation in the strengthening of Eurasian security. 
Russia cannot accept the tendency toward NATO's expansion via 
the admission of East European countries to the bloc. This 
approach is akin to the building of a new "movable Berlin wall." 
  This would require the solution of many questions, both 
purely military and economic. The strategic grouping of 
Russia's troops in the West now is such that the potential 
admission of former WPO countries to the North Atlantic bloc 
would necessitate its radical restructuring involving huge 
economic expenditures, let alone any other losses the country's 
national economy will incur. 
  The formation of a collective security system must be 
switched to a new track: By proposing the disbandment of NATO 
and the formation of a new, broader, and more open structure 
with participation by Russia and the East European countries 
(possibly through the CSCE). 
  The positive experience accumulated by the CSCE must be 
extended to other regions in the world. On the basis of Russian 
interests, primarily to the Asia-Pacific region. By galvanizing 
its foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region, Russia could 
initiate the launch of a process similar to the CSCE in this 
region and the holding of a summit conference (following the 
Helsinki model). One of the stages of this process could be the 
convening, on Russia's initiative, of the first Asia-Pacific 
interparliamentary conference in, for example, Vladivostok. 
  Two specific initiatives are proposed: To hold talks to 
define quotas for the arms trade and to create a permanent 
Conference of Arms Exporting Countries within the framework of a 
new international organization to be set up in the place of 
COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls]. 
  There is full justification for placing ecology 
issues among the series of international security problems. 
The conclusion of an international convention on liability for 
damage dome to the environment as a result of the nuclear arms 
race could be an effective measure for the maintenance of 
"international ecological security." 
  Two main trends dominate the West's policy at 
present: 
  a) To use all possible means to push Russia into copying the 
Western, primarily the U.S., model regardless of any 
consequences for the country and the population. 
  b) To prevent Russia from taking full advantage of the 
West's 
modern technological achievements and drive it mainly toward the 
production of raw materials, fuel, and semimanufactures, in 
other words to sink the country in backwardness, in the "third 
world." 
  Many people believe that any expectations that the West and 
the United States will help the revival of a mighty and 
independent Russia are at best naive. The West is increasingly 
losing its interest in us because, first, we have lost our 
former economic and military strength and, second, we are no 
longer claiming to be creating a social alternative to the West. 
At the same time, as can be seen from B. Clinton's speeches, in 
the long term and by attracting resources for its modernization 
from Germany and Japan and possibly from France, Italy, and 
Britain, Russia could weaken competition between the Western 
powers in the economic sphere. 
  It is also worth noting the question of reviving the bipolar 
system but on a completely new basis. The idea of forming a 
"second pole" is certainly not the product of abstract 
imagination or a speculative project. The shortcomings and 
dangers of the "monopolar system" make it necessary to consider 
the alternative idea of a "second pole": The U.S. monopoly as 
the sole world leader could tragically destabilize international 
relations. By its very nature, the bipolar system offers a more 
stable basis for cooperation between the centers of world 
politics. 
  It will enable the "third world" countries, China, and 
Russia 
to protect their common and individual interests in a more or 
less organized way and, consequently, to guarantee the greater 
effectiveness of their efforts. 
  The creation of a "second pole" could also strengthen 
military-political stability in the countries adjoining it and 
could become an instrument for settling conflicts without the 
West's interference. 
  A serious motivation for this could be provided by the need 
to protect national cultural assets, to counter the expansion of 
Western mass culture, and at the same time to pool efforts for 
the shaping of competitive national cultures on the basis of the 
peoples' own vital values and the renewal of their traditions. 
Equal collaboration between all cultures could serve as a 
counterweight to the hegemony of Western mass culture which is 
being implanted. 
  Finally, a substantial justification for forming a "second 
pole" is provided by the quest for a new type of civilization to 
replace the dominant industrial-capitalist one, whose exhaustion 
and crisis are increasingly obvious and universally recognized. 
This objective could attract sympathy for the "second pole" 
among many progressive streams in the West, which are concerned 
with the quest for a new way of life. 
  Collaboration between the two centers would most probably 
lead to positive changes in the nature and content of the first 
pole's activity and give it a more realistic orientation. Even 
the actual discussion of the problems of creating a "second 
pole" could lead to favorable, albeit partial, positive changes. 
In our opinion, bipolarity will accelerate the process of 
forming a global system on the basis of the balance of interests 
and become a step in that direction. 
  All of mankind, including the Atlantic center, is interested 
in creating the "second pole" because it offers a program for 
extrication from the crisis being experienced by the whole 
world. Although the "second pole" is needed partly as a 
counterweight to the first, their relations need not be 
antagonistic but could be built on the principle of cooperation, 
including cooperation between the United States and Russia. 
  A return to the bipolar model of the world is not the only 
possible option. The multipolar system also has its advantages. 
In any case, it is important to ensure that this system 
guarantees stability and Russia occupies in it a position 
befitting the status of a great power. 
<H6>  5. Disarmament Problems </H6>
  Russia did not inherit any military-political allies from 
the 
USSR. It is objectively unable to maintain the mighty armed 
forces which the Soviet Union had. In many directions, the 
parameters of Russia's defense were moved far beyond the limits 
of its state borders. Now the country either has no such 
parameters, or they have ended up being unusually close to its 
central regions. 
  The end of the "great confrontation" between the two 
superpowers did not lead to the triumph of the principle of 
nonuse of force in international affairs as proclaimed by the 
United Nations, or to the disbandment of military-political 
alliances created, or so the explanation went, to parry "the 
Soviet military threat." Moreover, the sole remaining 
"superpower" displays a noticeably stronger desire to impose its 
will wherever it feels that U.S. interests exist, including the 
Baltic countries. 
  There is no need to explain that if Russia intends to solve 
its own problems guided by its own national 
interests, it must be strong in every respect including -- 
by no means least -- in defense questions. We have the full 
potential to do so. 
  This does not run counter to the long-term peacemaking 
guidelines proclaimed by Russia's president in his January 1992 
message to the UN Secretary General. The "principles of 
effective global and regional military-political stability" 
declared in this message also presuppose measures for mutual 
disarmament. This is precisely why Russia officially took over 
from the USSR the baton of reducing the military potentials of 
states and easing the level of international tension, it 
confirmed the commitments under international treaties and 
agreements to which the Soviet side was a party, and also signed 
in January 1993 the Russian-U.S. Treaty on the Further Reduction 
and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START II). Thus, 
the track taken by Russia in the sphere of the disarmament 
process is in line with the one which the USSR followed during 
the last years of its existence. But the different 
military-strategic conditions in which Russia now finds itself 
demand of it the elaboration of new concepts and approaches 
toward the solution of problems concerning the arms limitation 
and reduction. 
<H5>  Nuclear Disarmament Problems </H5>
  The SALT I and SALT II Soviet-U.S. agreements in the 
strategic arms limitation sphere were underpinned by the 
principle of equality and identical security which was agreed by 
the sides. Its main criterion was the ensuring of 
military-strategic equilibrium. This, in the sides' opinion, not 
only coincided with the security interests of the partners in 
the talks but also promoted the stabilization of the world 
situation. 
  But the last Soviet-U.S. Treaty on the Reduction and 
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START I) contained 
provisions making it possible to bypass this principle if 
necessary. 
  The Treaty's shortcomings included not only the universally 
known notional count of weapons which totally negated the sides' 
initially proclaimed intention to reduce their strategic 
potential by one-half, but also a series of provisions placing 
the sides in unequal conditions. 
  For example, the Treaty imposes stricter limitations on 
land-based ICBM's which have traditionally been the foundations 
of the USSR's (and now of Russia's) strategic might. At the 
same time, the most liberal interpretation has been applied to 
reduction requirements for heavy bombers, in which the United 
States enjoys a threefold advantage. 
  There is absolutely no justification for excluding from the 
Treaty's effect the strategic sea-launched cruise missiles, 
which are objectively more advantageous for the United States. 
  The Soviet side simply failed to obtain agreement from its 
partners at the talks that the ABM Treaty should be observed 
while the START I Treaty is in force. Consequently, the United 
States retained the possibility to change the strategic 
potential to its advantage by implementing the SDI program. 
  The START I Treaty has still not come into force. Despite 
this, a new -- now Russian-U.S. -- Treaty on the Further 
Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Weapons (START 
II) was signed in January 1993 following comparatively brief 
talks. But this treay is not flawless. 
  Suffice it to mention its provisions on the procedure for 
the 
conversion of ICBM's and submarine-launched ballistic missiles 
from multiple-warhead to single-warhead and the "reorientation" 
of 100 U.S. heavy bombers "for the performance of nonnuclear 
tasks." 
  The START II Treaty's provisions potentially offer the U.S. 
side an opportunity to re-install more than 4,500 nuclear 
warheads on strategic delivery platforms within the briefest of 
time frames. Bearing in mind that the total number of nuclear 
warheads the sides may hold after the reductions should not 
exceed 3,000-3,500 units, Russia runs the risk of finding itself 
in a situation whereby the United States, having for some reason 
denounced the START II Treaty, could very quickly double its 
strategic nuclear potential. Under the terms of the Treaty, 
Russia, should it wish to do the same, would not be able to 
boost its potential by more than 900 units the same way. 
  Nonetheless, Russia has ratified the START I Treaty and has 
expressed rediness to ratify the START II Treaty with all their 
shortcomings and positive aspects. 
  At the same time, it is perfectly clear that the process of 
the limitation and reduction of strategic arms will be 
continued. At some stage it will be joined by other nuclear 
powers. On what basis should these talks be conducted? What 
should be their ultimate goal? 
  The question of complete elimination of nuclear weapons will 
hardly be raised in the foreseeable future -- the other nuclear 
powers are not raising this task even as an idea. The agenda 
will evidently include the question of arriving at some maximum 
level for strategic nuclear arms to correspond with the 
so-called "minimum nuclear deterrence." Back in the past the 
USSR expressed readiness to support this idea and to discuss and 
agree its strategic meaning and basic criteria. It might 
possibly be useful to repeat this attempt. Nevertheless, 
regardless of whether this concept will be discussed on a 
multilateral or bilateral (with the United States) basis, 
Russia will have to determine: What, in its 
military-strategic position, should be meant by "minimum nuclear 
deterrence," and this should be the subsequent guiding principle 
when elaborating positions for talks on strategic nuclear arms 
and on nuclear arms in general. This will help prevent any 
reduction of Russian nuclear forces below a certain critical 
limit. It would not go amiss to also appraise the extent to 
which this criterion corresponds with the START I and START II 
Treaties. 
  When accpting the concept of "minimum nuclear deterrence" at 
the talks, it is necessary to bear in mind that this decision 
will inevitably necessitate the examination -- either in 
parallel or jointly with strategic nuclear arms -- of the 
questions of tactical nuclear arms, especially if they are 
deployed so as to reach targets on the other side's territory, 
including ship-based weapons, as well as the unconditional 
observance of the ABM Treaty. 
<H5>  Limitation of Conventional Armed Forces and Their Armaments </H5>
  The consistent process of disarmament must certainly become 
the normal policy of any peaceloving state in the 
post-confrontation period. Furthermore, the outbreaks of 
interethnic and other regional conflicts testify that the 
reduction of the potential of conventional armed forces and 
armaments is a task as important as that of reducing strategic 
and tactical nuclear potentials. 
  The continuation of talks on conventional armed forces and 
armaments is especially topical for Russia. It is necessary not 
only because it is becoming increasingly difficult to man and 
maintain such large armed forces, but also because we will have 
to honor committments under the 1990 Treaty on Conventional 
Armed Forces in Europe, the party to which was the Soviet Union 
and not Russia. This is not the same thing. 
  Therefore, strictly speaking, following the disappearance 
from the military-political arena of one of the collective 
parties to the Treaty -- the WPO -- and later on of the USSR, 
new talks ought to be held on the reduction of conventional 
armed forces in Europe and a new accord ought to be reached 
taking into account the sharp changes in the situation in this 
important region of the planet. 
  On 8 July 1992 Russia ratified the Treaty, under which it 
also committed itself to the stage-by-stage reduction of 
the numerical strength of its Army and Navy from 2.8 million to 
2.1 million men by 1995 and to 1.5 million men by the year 2000. 
At the same time, the NATO states did not embark on any 
limitation and reduction of the numerical strength of their 
armed forces and firmly refused to take naval forces -- one of 
the most important components -- into account when determining 
the military-strategic balance. Enjoying undisputed 
superiority in naval armaments capable of delivering strikes 
against land-based targets (carrier-borne aviation, sea-launched 
cruise missiles), NATO was unwilling to lose this "imbalance." 
This position is most typical of the entire "Western" approach 
toward talks on the limitation of conventional armed forces in 
Europe -- it envisaged the elimination of "imbalances" but only 
in those categories of armaments where the WPO enjoyed the 
advantage. 
  It is clear that any potential future talks cannot 
leave the question of naval armaments outside the scope of 
agreement, especially as regards armaments designed to strike 
against land-based targets. 
  The very fact of the acceptance of commitments under an 
accord elaborated for another state (the USSR) and for different 
military-strategic conditions really goes beyond the framework 
of ordinary common sense, which indicates that Russia 
ought to accept and honor only commitments which have been 
thoroughly and specifically elaborated for the Russian 
conditions. Otherwise the situation may reach the point of 
absurdity, as it did in 1993 during the withdrawal of troops 
from Germany and the attempt to deploy them in the North 
Caucasus Military District. It emerged that Russia could not do 
this without breaching several provisions of the treaty it had 
ratified. It also emerged that Russia cannot show any concern 
for its southern flank as it sees fit, since it is constrained 
by limitations under this treaty. 
  Much has been and is being said about the principle of 
"sufficiency." There is hardly a single state in the world 
which would declare that the military organizational development 
of its armed forces is guided by the principle of 
"insufficiency" or "supersufficiency." Therefore, the term of 
simple "sufficiency" is meaningless. The term "defensive 
sufficiency" or "sufficiency for defense" would be more 
appropriate to the concept of Russia's defense policy. But the 
meaning of even this term demands thorough elaboration. 
Only when this term has been given specific content, in line 
with the Russian state's military doctrine, it can and must 
provide the basis of positions for subsequent talks on arms 
limitation. 
<H6>  6. The Need To Improve the Mechanisms for Managing Military 
Organizational Development </H6>
  Any political programs of the leadership need a finetuned 
mechanism for their implementation, otherwise they will remain 
nothing but wishful thinking. In the sphere of military work, 
we are still nurturing the illusion that we are talking only of 
a partial reduction of the Armed Forces and a partial switch of 
the military economy to the manufacture of national economic 
output, and that the actual mechanism for managing military 
organizational development can remain basically the same. 
  Fundamental documents in the defense sphere are being 
implemented with difficulty. There is no doubt that the basic 
provisions of the military doctrine will create the necessary 
prerequisites for the organizational development of de facto new 
Armed Forces for Russia, for the reliable protection of its 
interests, for the elaboration of long-term military-technical 
policy, for the creation and further development of 
qualitatively new forces, and for the training and education of 
the personnel. The military doctrine approved by the 
president basically ensures that Russia will honor its 
international commitments on the reduction of armaments and 
Armed Forces and the maintenance of peace. 
  The specific application of the military doctrine in the 
sphere of the military economy is defined in the president's 
special edict No. 1850 of 11 November 1992. 
  Whereas only certain clarifying remarks can be made as 
regards the doctrine's military and military-technical aspects, 
there are doubts arising as regards the economic mechanism. 
This is because attempts are being made to retain the old 
methods of management and adapt them to the completely different 
socioeconomic conditions now developing in Russia. 
  Under the former administrative edict system of management, 
when all elements of the economic organism were not only 
subordinate to the state but also belonged to it, the main 
"mechanisms" of management were programs and plans (five-year, 
annual, and so on). The plans' ratification was followed by the 
implementation of the principle that "The plan is law and must 
be fulfilled at all costs." At times it was wrecked, more often 
than not it was fulfilled, but the "mechanism" functioned. 
  Now the situation has changed radically. Completely 
different laws operate in the market economy. Even the Law on 
Defense, adopted in 1992, enshrines that the state order, in 
other words the plan issued from above, calls for mandatory 
fulfillment only in wartime. Financial and economic incentives 
should be used in peacetime. The budget and the taxation 
system become the main instruments of management. 
  It is therefore anachronistic for the military doctrine, in 
its section on military-technical and economic foundations, to 
rely on "elaboration and implementation of long-term (up to 
10-15 years) programs for armaments and military equipment on 
the basis of state defense orders financed by the state." 
  Attention must mainly be given to a comprehensively 
substantiated and balanced defense budget. It is the budget 
that brings together the contradictory interests of various 
departments involved in the solution of tasks concerning the 
country's defense. Suffice it to recall the August-September 
1993 outburst of passions surrounding the budget at the highest 
level in Russia. This is why the budget needs independent expert 
appraisal. It will help the practical implementation of the 
doctrine's military-political provisions, and it is through the 
budget that civilian control will be exercised over the activity 
of the "power departments." 
  This is why representatives of various nonstate institutions 
advocate a public discussion of the defense budget, 
comprehensive control, and prompt accountability for its 
fuilfillment. 
  The Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine also contain 
other weak points, which prompt criticism by the opposition. 
Indeed, a series of provisions need clarification and amendment 
to the extent that life and Russia's military-strategic 
situation will change. 
<H5>  Challenges and Potentials </H5>
  History's main lesson is that we won World War II but lost 
the leadership race which is run according to economic rules. 
Having lost its superpower status, Russia slid headlong to the 
ranks of developing countries, and now even of regressing 
countries. For the first time in the last 40 years, we are not 
threatened by the permanent danger of global military conflict. 
But the domestic instability, the chaos, the devastation 
in the economy, and the mentality of losers pose an equal threat 
to national security. 
  The fundamentally new political reality of which our 
country's citizens are becoming painfully aware is that, for the 
first time throughout its thousand-year history, Russia 
has become a dependent country. It depends at least 
on foreign creditors, the dollar-ruble rate of exchange, foreign 
aid and investments, import deliveries, and raw material prices 
on the world market. The Russian Federation's foreign policy is 
no longer fully autonomous. International banks and agreements 
are largely trying to dictate even our domestic policy. We are 
virtually without allies in the world. 
  On the other hands, there are fewer external enemies, too. 
Russia has joined the system of multipolar coordinates of 
international security. 
  The situation is significantly worse within the area of the 
former USSR. Interethnic conflicts have flared along the 
borders. The former military-political and economic alliances 
and institutions have been destroyed, new ones have either not 
been created or are not functioning. The national pride of 
Great Russians has been denigrated. 
  The choice that society and the state now have to make is 
not 
free, either. Today we have to choose from a very limited 
number of options: 
  -- either Russia will remain a fully dependent 
country, 
  -- or it will remain partially dependent, 
  -- or Russia will strive for full independence. 
  Having decided this crucial issue for ourselves, we will be 
able to choose the sole scenario for the further development of 
events. 
  It appears that only the second option is the most 
realistic. It presupposes development based mainly on reliance 
on our own strength, but with a high degree of external aid. 
But our future freedom in decisionmaking will be limited in 
proportion with the degree of dependence. 
  To paraphrase W. Churchill's famous sentence, it can be said 
about Russia that we no longer have any friends, we have only 
partners. Whether we like it or not, this world is based 
on respect for the strength of authority and the might of the 
state. Unfortunately, we cannot expect the former respect 
without having the former might. Consequently, the most 
important task of Russia's leadership over the next few years is 
to restructure the economy, modernize fixed production 
assets, and reduce the energy- and materials-intensiveness of 
production. 
  The economic, financial, political, and military might can 
be 
boosted only on this basis. Only a program for steady economic 
growth over the next 10-15 years can ensure significant progress 
in the Russian economy's successful reform. 
  Democracy is fragile. All countries that have traversed the 
long path of nurturing genuine democracy know that a young 
democracy, unless it is legally, economically, and 
sociopolitically protected, is as a rule doomed to degenerate. 
  This is the mortal danger at present. 
  All this is aggravated by the fact that the new structure of 
life we are building in Russia is still far away from genuine 
diversity. The social base of reforms remains narrow. The 
shaping of a genuine middle class -- the foundation of future 
stabilization -- took the wrong path from the very beginning. 
  The restoration of our domestic viability in the sphere of 
productivity, investments, technology, education, and 
energy is the most important task for ensuring both 
domestic and external security, stability, and independence. 
This is the basis on which the new nationwide 
ideology should be formulated. 
  The government, local administrations, and Federal Assembly 
deputies must realize: We are living in a changed and changing 
world. The independent states' economies can no longer remain 
strictly national. Differences between domestic and foreign 
policy are fading. In our relations with CIS states it is 
important to convincingly demonstrate the role of 
destructive economic nationalism and cooperate with 
them in the quest for peaceful ways to resolve ethnic crises 
threatening stability in Russia, Europe, and the world. 
  It is also necessary to be aware that, having failed to 
organize our own efficient production of competitive goods, we 
are forced to import them from abroad thus creating additional 
jobs over there rather than at home and dooming our own workers 
to unemployment and poverty. The opposite also applies. This 
is why the majority of social problems and crises in 1994 will 
be associated with the economy and with domestic and foreign 
policy. The realization of this is already halfway to solution, 
and the adoption of correct decisions is halfway to success. 
The other half will be determined by Russia's citizens -- their 
mood, new incentives for labor, discipline, and 
entrepreneurship, respect for the law, and faith in reform. 
Hundreds of correct laws may be promulgated, the world's best 
constitution may be adopted, but we will not extricate ourselves 
from the system's crisis unless man feels the need to live and 
work better. 
  The central problem in 1994 is to restore the prestige 
of state power and create an effective mechanism for the laws' 
operation and for monitoring the fulfillment of adopted 
decisions. 
  National security begins with reliable protection of 
Russia's 
citizens against any attacks and infringements. It is necessary 
to radically review the attitude toward this question, because 
the problem of human rights stands right behind it. 
Why should the assassination of one U.S. citizen in any country 
immediately result in inevitable and effective sanctions, while 
the assassination of Russian officers in Georgia and Tajikistan 
goes unpunished? The state's might was not created in order to 
remain inactive. The experience of the latest mass operations 
to impose elementary order in the capital and the country shows 
that the population will understand and support any actions by 
the authorities to put an end to crime. This does not in any 
way contradict the norms of democracy. 
  Moreover, it ought to be borne in mind that the authority of 
the Russian Federation's government, Federal Assembly, and 
president is largely determined by the quality of our 
ideas, values, and leadership and the competitiveness of our 
goods in the world market, rather than by superior military 
might. 
  We will have to solve the budget deficit problems, curb 
inflation, strengthen the regime of savings, and increase 
capital investments. We also need a taxation system and a 
legislative system capable of boosting production rather than 
hindering it. The lost heights in the spheres of health care, 
education, vocational training, and social security must be 
regained step by step. 
  Following the disintegration of the former economic ties, 
there has been a sharp deterioration of the condition of the 
Russian infrastructure as a whole, and targeted investments will 
be required there. 
  The following problems will be inevitably exacerbated in 
1994: 
  -- inflation will evolve into galloping 
hyperinflation; 
  -- the rising prices of energy sources will produce a 
"domino effect" -- a race in prices of foodstuffs, commodities, 
and services; 
  -- there will be a further slump in production and a 
series of sectors will come to a halt on a nationwide scale; 
  --there is a threat of social explosion in the further 
growth of the strike movement, whose participants will 
increasingly often, and in parallel with economic demands, make 
strictly political demands: the government's resignation, the 
president's impeachment; 
  -- society's corruption will reach an 
unprecedented scale; 
  -- the rise in crime will take mainly the path of growing 
numbers of economic crimes and gangster-like 
formations; 
  -- demographic regression: higher mortality rate, 
reduced life expectancy, declining birth rate; pensioners and 
declasse elements will die off on a massive scale; 
  -- unless effective changes are introduced in tax 
legislation, the gap between the richest and the poorest strata 
of the population will widen and will exceed all world 
indicators; 
  -- we can expect a significant increase in the number 
of Russian-speaking refugees from nearby foreign countries to 
Russia which will significantly complicate the social 
atmosphere in many regions. The government will have to firmly 
apply economic sanctions against neighboring states where the 
rights of the Russian-speaking population are violated; 
  -- new seats of interethnic conflicts will possibly 
emerge; 
  -- 1994 will see a higher proportion of private trade, 
free enterprise, and the private sector of production in 
general. But the banking system will have to be made more 
flexible and efficient with a view to encouraging the 
development of production, rather than redistribution; 
  -- potential economic progress in Russia in 1994 will depend 
largely on the restoration, at a qualitatively new level, of 
regional and international ties, partnership, and cooperation; 
  -- as national currencies are introduced in a series of CIS 
countries and the single ruble zone is being destroyed, it 
is forecast that they will be swiftly devalued against both the 
ruble and the dollar. Russia could be swamped by the flood of 
Russian bank notes being sent back. This could be worse 
than the size of any emission in terms of its inflationary 
consequences. There will be a need for emergency monetary 
reform and the introduction of a new ruble backed by the 
International Russian Bank; 
  -- fresh attempts may be made to secede from the 
Federation and the separatism of its components may be stepped 
up; 
  -- Russia today has been bled almost dry and it cannot 
continue to act as a selfless donor for nearby foreign 
countries solely on the strength of the inertia of the 
"proletarian internationalism" ideology. It can be forecast 
that there will be a tenfold increase of the number of 
attempts to illegally export commodities and raw materials from 
the Russian Federation; 
  -- in 1994 the government will inevitably face the problem 
of 
building hundreds of border checkpoints along Russia's new 
state border with all former Union republics, including 
Cossack detachments and settlements and a firm rejection of 
border "transparency." Full-scale consulates and embassies will 
have to be open and a large number of bilateral treaties and 
decisions will have to be adopted; 
  -- in contrast with the majority of government organizations 
and institutions, we are forced to forecast something which has 
been disregarded hitherto: Russia is approaching an 
ecological disaster; 
  It is necessary to promptly introduce in Russia tough 
standards of environmental quality and sanctions for 
their violation, even including criminal liability; 
  -- Russia's talents have always been and still remain 
one of its categories of national wealth. The so-called 
brain drain abroad has reached unprecendented levels at present. 
The national science, culture, art, and literature have been 
shunted to the preiphery of state interests. It can be said -- 
not just about oil and gas fields but also about the Russian 
talents -- that, by silently backing this antinational policy, 
we are "selling off" our grandchildren's heritage and depriving 
them of prospects for their intellectual and spiritual 
development; 
  -- Russia's successes in the exploration of space 
have always been and still remain a matter of national pride. 
It is necessaty to adopt a targeted program for the 
long-term preservation of science-intensive production units and 
space reasearch. To encourage private and foreign capital 
investments in space research and to create new jobs. If we 
miss the opportunity to adopt radical decisions about the future 
of science and space research, their degradation will 
become irreversible and this, in its turn, will slow down 
the growth of our country's economy and the development of its 
scientific, engineering, and industrial base. 
  Thus we can imagine what Russia's future can be 
like. We want to and can ensure that our great country is 
dominated by Peace, Spirituality, Democracy, Love for the 
Fatherland and our neighbor, in accordance with the genuine 
laws of the development of civilization. 
  In order to ensure that the proposed strategy becomes 
reality 
and part of all citizens' world outlook and is given a chance to 
succeed, it must be constructively discussed. 
  Of course, its realization will demand FAITH in our 
future, TREMENDOUS COURAGE, and mainly PATIENT AND SELFLESS WORK 
and INSPIRATION. All these qualities are inherent in the 
Russian people. 
  Let us then make our Dream a Reality! Russia is a great 
country, with a great history, a harsh present, but also a great 
future. We believe that the coming 21st century will be 
Russia's century.
