  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called 
for a general stocktaking in society at the forum "Safeguarding 
Germany as a business and investment location" in Bonn today. 
Even an improved economic situation, which is already emerging, 
cannot alone remove the structural failings of past years, the 
chancellor stressed. Important reforms, such as the reform of 
the railways and the postal service, have been delayed for 
decades. At the same time, during the good years unions and 
employers nowhere near managed to exploit to the full the legal 
scope for more flexible working hours and longer machine running 
times. 
  Kohl described as a priority "completing economic and social 
unity in Germany." The people in eastern Germany today are 
going through a "difficult and far-reaching structural change at 
a breathtaking pace." Much less radical changes in western 
Germany would put people very much on the defensive, he said.

<F P=106> [Report signed "Th.": "Kohl Sees Reason for `Realistic </F>
Optimism'"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- "I am quite pleased that confidence is 
growing." With these words Chancellor Helmut Kohl commented on 
the recession at the forum "Safeguarding Germany as a Business 
and Investment Location," organized by Economics Minister 
Guenther Rexrodt in Bonn. The majority of the structural 
problems that we have to settle today have "nothing whatsoever" 
to do with German unity. In the next tax reform, clear priority 
must be given to families with children. Safeguarding Germany's 
attractiveness as a business location includes improving the 
climate for progress and technology, Kohl pointed out. The 
chancellor sees reason for "realistic optimism." Rexrodt 
stressed that the inflexibility that is currently prevailing 
might ultimately mean the end. [as published]

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Following the failure of pay 
talks in Cologne for the engineering industry, IG Metall has 
called around 20,000 workers in over 30 factories in Bavaria out 
on token strike. According to the Bavarian region of the union, 
those affected include the car manufacturer Audi in Ingolstadt 
and Bosch in Bamberg, as well as Siemens and Siemens-Nixdorf 
plants in Upper Bavaria. Rallies and demonstrations are planned 
outside the workplace in Ingolstadt, Waldkraiburg, and Bamberg. 
Among the factories affected by the token strikes is the 
Zeuna-Staerker firm of Hubert Staerker, the president of the 
Bavarian Engineering Association, in Augsburg.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt has described the fight against unemployment as "the 
government's most important goal." The fact that over four 
million of their fellow citizens do not have jobs is one of the 
greatest challenges for society and the state, since the 
founding of the Federal Republic, Rexrodt said today in response 
to the latest labor market figures from Nuremberg. This is not 
one of the usual economic crises, but "a deep structural crisis." 
  Rexrodt resolutely rejected "political demagogues" with 
"patent prescriptions." Rather, it is necessary to embark "upon 
the stony path of structural renewal." 
  The economics minister called upon companies and unions to 
keep a sense of perspective in pay disputes. "Both sides in the 
current [engineering] pay dispute can signal common sense."

<F P=106> [Report signed "ps": "Highest Number of Unemployed Since </F>
the End of the War; Over 4 Million People Without Jobs"] 
  [Text] Nuremberg -- The number of unemployed in Germany in 
January exceeded 4 million for the first time. On 31 January, a 
total of 4,029,491 million were registered as unemployed in 
eastern and western Germany. This is an increase of over 
340,000 since the end of December. The rise in the old laender 
was about 222,400. Unemployment increased from 8.1 percent to 
8.8 percent in western Germany, and from 15.4 percent to 17 
percent in the east of the country. The president of the 
Federal Employment Office, Bernhard Jagoda, stressed that the 
rise has mainly been caused by seasonal factors. Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt spoke of the greatest challenge for the 
state and the society since the founding of the FRG. 
  Without allowing for the impact of special seasonal factors 
on developments in the labor market, the number of unemployed 
rose by 27,000, Jagoda announced in Nuremberg on Tuesday [9 
February]. The economic difficulties were particularly felt in 
western Germany whereas structural adjustments continue to 
influence the labor market in eastern Germany. In addition, the 
number of jobs declined again in the old laender. At 28.8 
million, there were 600,000 fewer employees at the end of the 
year than in December 1992. 
  Despite the new record of 2,736,068 million unemployed in 
the 
old laender in January, and in spite of the general decline in 
employment, the increase in unemployment has been slightly 
slower since autumn 1993. Compared with the previous January, 
the number of unemployed had risen by about 479,000. Last 
October, the increase from the same month in 1992 was over 
528,000. Jagoda stated that he proceeds from the premise that 
the situation will "improve tangibly" in the course of the year. 
This would mean that average unemployment would remain below 4 
million in 1994. 
  Short-time work was also reduced in eastern and western 
Germany. In the west, the number of those affected by regular 
work shortages dropped from 556,192 to 517,374. In the east, 
the number declined by 10,000 to 115,900 in January. The 
decline is even clearer if one compares last year with the 
previous year. The number dropped by 340,000 in the west and by 
nearly 99,000 in the east. 
  Jagoda believes that the rise of unemployment in the new 
laender by 118,000 to 1,293,400 is also mainly due to seasonal 
factors. However, the number of jobless also rose because the 
impact of job creation measures, advanced training, and other 
instruments of labor market policy has weakened. 
  Thus, the number of jobs created within this scheme dropped 
from 325,510 last year to approximately 223,000 in January 1994. 
Early retirement has also declined sharply. If one includes 
short-time work, the measures by the labor offices have 
prevented about 1.3 million unemployed in the east. In January 
1993, the number was 1.7 million. 
  The number of employed in the old laender did not drop as 
much in December as it had in the previous year. However, 
according to a report by the Federal Statistics Office in 
Wiesbaden released on Tuesday, at 28.437 million, their number 
had still decreased by 621,000 or 2.1 percent from last year. 
In October and November, a decline of 2.2 percent was 
registered. Taking into consideration seasonal factors, 
employment declined by 6,000 in December from the previous year. 
One year ago, the figure was 39,000. 
  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany) described the negative record as "one of the greatest 
challenges for the state and society" since the founding of the 
FRG. The social spokesman of the Bundestag Group of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany, Ottmar Schreiner, accused the 
government of manipulating the statistics. He stated that, 
through joint projects, it wants to introduce "some kind of 
voluntary labor service" for the unemployed, and to eliminate 
them from the unemployment statistics. The Bundestag Group of 
the Alliance 90/Greens spoke of a complete failure of the labor 
policy of the coalition.

<F P=106> [DPA report: "A Total of 3,300 Jobs Will Be Lost at </F>
Grundig"] 
  [Excerpts] Fuerth -- The Dutch Philips Corporation, which 
took over the management of Grundig 10 years ago, has decided to 
divide Grundig AG in Fuerth into 11 independent companies. 
  A management umbrella organization will continue the 
traditional name, Pieter D. Harmsen, chairman of the board of 
directors, announced after an extraordinary meeting of the board 
of governors in Fuerth on Friday evening [4 February]. The 
restructuring entails a reduction of jobs by 3,300 to 11,400 in 
the corporation by mid-1995. 
  The corporation managers justified the profound 
restructuring 
by pointing to the development at Grundig, which is practically 
an "almost-collapse." The basic reason for this is the decline 
on the European market for entertainment electronics. [passage 
omitted] 
  About 2,200 of the jobs will be abolished in Germany, where 
currently 8,900 people work for Grundig, company spokesman 
Roland Stehle announced on Saturday. [passage omitted] 
  Nine of the 11 new Grundig companies will remain in Germany, 
including the Grundig Bildprodukte GmbH. In 1994 it plans to 
produce 2.5 million television sets. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed P.-H.D.: "The `Foch' in the Adriatic"] </F>
  [Text] France has decided to reinforce its presence in the 
Adriatic. The Foch aircraft carrier is expected to leave for 
the Adriatic sea tomorrow morning at the latest, with an escort 
consisting of the Suffren missile-launcher frigate and the Meuse 
refueling ship. 
  The three ships will join with the Ouragan landing-barge 
transporter -- which has been carrying out the "Balbuzard" 
national mission -- as well as the Cassard antiaircraft frigate 
and the Commandant de Pimodan destroyer -- which have been 
participating in Sharp Guard, the embargo control operation of 
the WEU [Western European Union]. 
  The Foch's air strike capabilities will include some 20 
Super 
Etendard jets as well as a number of Alize aircraft and 
helicopters. 
  These will complement the French Air Force already present 
in 
Italy: 10 Mirage 2000 RDI air superiority fighters based in 
Cervia (Italy); five Mirage F1 CR reconnaissance aircraft and 
eight laser-guided assault Jaguar aircraft based in Istrana 
(Italy); one C-35 refueler aircraft and one AWACS radar aircraft. 
  In addition to shipboard aircraft such as those on the U.S. 
Saratoga carrier, over 120 U.S., British, French, Spanish, 
Turkish, and Netherlands aircraft are based ashore around the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  In total, it is estimated that NATO has over 160 aircraft 
under its command in the region. The departure of the Foch for 
the Adriatic sea will therefore assume a primarily political 
meaning. 
  This meaning is meant to be all the stronger since the 
government had to suspend the second testing campaign of the 
marine version of the Rafale fighter aircraft on the Foch, which 
was to take place mostly this week.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Aftermath of Horror"] </F>
  [Text] In the days following a bloodbath, silent dignity 
can sometimes be more appropriate than powerless indignation. 
After the latest slaughter in Sarajevo, nothing would be worse 
for Western credibility than a fleeting burst of anger. Indeed, 
it will be easy to stress that previous UN or NATO admonitions 
to the belligerents remained devoid of any consequences. 
  This powerlessness in implementing decisions actually made 
stems from Western disagreements on ways to bring the conflict 
to an end as well as on the political objectives to pursue. 
Should the standing threat of selective air strikes be carried 
out? Military officials do not relish this solution because, 
beyond the risks it implies for their men, they fear military 
activism may only be a smoke screen for the inertia of 
politicians. 
  For such strikes to be meaningful, they must be part of an 
overall strategy which provide very clearly for a "second 
strike," the one that may become necessary if the first one -- 
regardless of its degree of success on a technical level -- does 
not bring the expected political result. In other words, the 
international community must ask itself how far it is ready to 
go and for what ends. 
  Objectives can range from putting an end to the shelling of 
Sarajevo and lifting the siege of the city to achieving a 
general ceasefire leading to renewed and serious negotiations; 
the targets will then vary accordingly, as will the extent of 
the resources used and the duration of the operation. 
  Until now, Western nations have disagreed on just about 
anything, be it the importance of the conflict in the definition 
of the post-Cold War world, the allocation of mutual 
responsibilities, the solutions to be implemented, or even the 
necessity to act. They tried to alleviate the situation through 
means often courageous, sometimes hazardous, and perchance 
effective from a humanitarian viewpoint, but which only 
contained the pain as they could not cure it. 
  Some may deem it positive that the conflict has not 
extended, 
that foreign powers have not contributed, as they did before, to 
a new Balkan war, that the European Union has somehow preserved 
its unity, albeit at the cost of its credibility. 
  Can one stick contentedly with such modest objectives and 
not 
attempt to impose rules of good neighborly conduct to peoples 
bent on mayhem? Even retreating to our ivory tower -- however 
inglorious a proposition -- would be less of a disgrace than 
useless swagger. However, if we believe action is the right 
choice, then we must stop talking about what we will not do, and 
then suit our action to our word.

<F P=106> [Frederic Bobin commentary: "`Corsica Issue' in the </F>
Republic"] 
  [Text] How far away seem the separatism proceedings on the 
Corsica issue conducted against the socialist governments by the 
right! Although [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua does not 
want to admit officially that he benefited a great deal from the 
work accomplished by his predecessor, Pierre Joxe, the 
institutional boil has been lanced and the nationalist family 
has exploded. One cannot help but notice that the government's 
continuity of attitude toward Corsica scorns changeovers. By 
formally establishing the islands specific nature in terms of 
fiscal structure and language, Edouard Balladur has once again 
shown that the "center" is intelligent enough to make 
concessions to its "periphery." The reason of state includes 
that kind of common sense. 
  However, nothing has yet been signed and sealed. The fate of 
Messrs. Balladur and Pasqua's gentle approach still depends on 
two unknowns. The first unknown stems from the reception given 
it by the nationalists. It is obvious now that the government 
has taken over part of their rhetoric on the "Corsica issue" -- 
the part that can be best reconciled with the imperative of the 
"unity of the Republic" -- so that it can do a better job toning 
down its originality. After playing the game so far, could they 
accept -- in the long term -- this kind of erosion of their 
ideological capital? 
  The reaction of "A Cuncolta Naziunaliste," a legal movement 
close to the historic FLNC-Canal [Corsica National Liberation 
Front], denouncing the "appearances of change" and the "reality 
of dependence," bears witness to genuine confusion. The state 
most certainly provides less opportunity for their criticism 
than during the touchy Jacobin period, but there is nothing to 
say that these nationalists will not rebound off other 
resentments and, in particular, the blunders that could be made 
by their local opponents. That is the second unknown. Will the 
traditionalist elected representatives, who bear a great deal of 
responsibility for the troubles afflicting the island, be up to 
the task? While the guerilla war surrounding the succession of 
Jean-Paul de Rocca Serra, the RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
speaker of the Corsica Assembly, gets under way, will they yield 
to the poisoned delicacy of the "combinazione" [combination] 
which they habitually delight in, thus letting precious time 
slip away? Will they make good use of the 3 billion francs 
which Paris and Brussels are going to shower on them between now 
and the end of the decade? 
  The past tends more toward skepticism, and we can understand 
that Mr. Pasqua wants to hasten the change of generations. 
Otherwise, the nationalists, which have always lived on the 
denunciation of the "clan," will find an unexpected mainstay in 
it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the French </F>
Central Bank, by Lorenz Winter in Paris; date not given: 
"`There Must Not Be a Brutal Break When Euro-Currency Is 
Introduced'"] 
  [Text] Since the beginning of the year, the French Central 
Bank, the Banque de France, has been independent -- that is, it 
is no longer subject to directives from the Paris government. 
WELT AM SONNTAG was the first German newspaper to be granted an 
interview by the head of the French Central Bank, Governor 
Jean-Claude Trichet. 
  [Winter] Mr. Trichet, the French economics minister said 
that the Banque de France's new freedom of action is "at least 
equal to that of the German Bundesbank." Do you regard this 
evaluation as justified? 
  [Trichet] Well, the minister certainly did not want to say 
that the Banque de France would have more powers than the 
Bundesbank in the future. However, one thing is clear: The new 
statutes of the French Central Bank guarantee its independence 
with rigorous strength. The law neither allows the governor nor 
his deputy or the members of the banks' monetary advisory 
council to receive instructions from the government or anyone 
else or request such instructions. 
  [Winter] So, can one say that the Banque de France will 
speak with the same authority as the Bundeswehr? 
  [Trichet] Authority cannot be decreed; it has to be gained 
in practice. Yet, one can now say with certainty that the 
credibility of the Banque de France has made a quantum leap 
thanks to its new status. Besides, I believe that observers of 
the French economy and currency have noticed an constant 
increase in credibility of our house for several years. 
  [Winter] Really? Is this credibility, particularly in 
Germany, not still suffering from France's reputation of being a 
country with inflationary tendencies and an instable currency -- 
caused by years of index-linked incomes and a -- at least 
consciously tolerated -- deterioration of the exchange rate of 
the franc? 
  [Trichet] I should be most surprised if such ideas were 
still widespread in the German public after many years of 
monetary stability, which asked great efforts from our country 
and its citizens; in fact, I can hardly believe it. 
  The instruments and methods that you mentioned might have 
played a role in the postwar era, whereas today they have been 
absolutely eliminated from the French economy. Besides, in the 
long term, monetary stability has had a great tradition in 
France. Not only has France never experienced hyperinflation 
comparable to Germany but between 1700 and 1914, the value of 
the French currency remained unusually constant. This proves 
how strongly our country was committed to a culture of monetary 
stability. 
  [Winter] Still, before the first independent resolutions of 
the Banque de France's monetary advisory council of late 
January, requests were increasing again for abandoning the 
policy of a "strong franc," and Banque de France was asked to 
use its new freedom of action "generously" from the very 
beginning. 
  [Trichet] True, but as you know, such views ultimately 
failed to get sufficient support -- and, in my opinion, this is 
what matters. 
  [Winter] Are some observers not simply waiting for a 
possible budget crisis or a new monetary crisis to see whether 
the Banque de France will not lose its balance on the slippery 
path of virtue? 
  [Trichet] No, I do not think so, because there is one thing 
that you must not forget in this connection: In France you do 
not have, on the one hand, a government that is lax in terms of 
monetary policy and, on the other hand, a central bank that 
thinks and acts along orthodox lines. I believe that the idea 
of a conceptual conflict that might erupt openly one day is 
wrong. 
  [Winter] Is this a consequence of the disciplinarian corset 
of Maastricht? 
  [Trichet] Maastricht certainly played an important role for 
drawing up our new statutes, even though it was by no means the 
only reason for releasing the Banque de France into 
independence. The liberalization of our economy and the 
increased international credibility of our currency came 
together to encourage the French Government to present an 
amendment of statutes that was adopted by a majority in the 
National Assembly and the Senate. 
  [Winter] How would you now assess the position and the tasks 
of your house in the concert of European central banks? 
  [Trichet] Please, let me say just one thing in this 
connection, and that is that in the circle of European central 
banks, there are institutes today that have their independence 
guaranteed by law as we do, while others do not. Yet, the 
latter are also trying just like the Banque the France to boost 
their credibility and authority and -- if you will -- their 
prestige toward the inside and outside. 
  [Winter] What about the central banks of countries seeking 
European Union membership? 
  [Trichet] These countries will be required to respect the 
Maastricht Treaty, including all rights and duties. So, if 
their central banks have not -- or not yet -- been granted 
independence by law, one of the duties of these countries is to 
make them independent under the treaty. 
  [Winter] How will the Banque de France fashion its own 
monetary policy under this aspect in the future? Along a German 
or rather an English pattern? 
  [Trichet] Instead of risking a possible inappropriate 
comparison, let me just point out the following: The very first 
lines of our statutes commit us to preserve price stability. 
The first resolution of the monetary advisory council set a 
clear limit of 2 percent both for 1994 and the following four 
years. Our strategy could have hardly been formulated more 
explicitly. 
  [Winter] At the first meeting of the European Monetary 
Institute in Frankfurt, its president, Alexandre Lamfalussy, was 
skeptical about a single currency by the year 1997. Do you 
share his pessimism? 
  [Trichet] Everyone has the right to make his or her own 
judgment and assessment of the chances of this difficult issue. 
So, what can be said objectively? For the commission, the 
council of economics and finance ministers, the European 
Council, and the central bank governors, Maastricht provides a 
detailed list of mandatory criteria, decision procedures, and 
rules of conduct. 
  There are two crucial years: 1997 and 1999. The first one 
requires a majority of countries that must fulfill all 
Maastricht criteria to permit the issue of a single currency. 
Particularly if one looks at the public deficits of many EU 
countries, I understand that some observers are skeptical 
regarding 1997. As far as 1999 is concerned, a majority is no 
longer a condition. Then even a "hard core" of countries that 
fulfill the convergence regulations might introduce a single 
currency among them. 
  [Winter] People, particularly in Germany, keep asking what 
this day X should look like. Will everyone get 40 ECU in their 
hands comparable to what was done at the time of the German 
monetary reform in 1948? 
  [Trichet] When I recently gave a lecture on the future of 
the European Monetary Union to the Finance Committee of the 
German Bundestag, I was dazzled by similar questions asked even 
by committee members. This is why I think that the following 
information can be quite useful. First of all, governments and 
central banks must define and settle the transition process as 
precisely as possible from the very beginning so that all future 
users of a single currency -- and senior citizens, in particular 
-- will not get confused. Moreover, it has to be clear that by 
issuing a currency of its own, Europe will not draw a line under 
its past or will even try to punish a failure but, by merging 
its best currencies, it is simply taking one step ahead -- 
toward more economic prosperity and more personal freedom of 
movement within the Union, and more monetary authority toward 
the outside. 
  [Winter] So the transition to the European currency would 
take place gradually? 
  [Trichet] That is what I personally expect. As far as I am 
concerned, there must no be a brutal break; for a certain 
period, the national and EU currencies might even circulate side 
by side. Particularly also regarding German fears about he 
future of the mark this would have the advantage that one could 
demonstrate to everybody that the new currency is not "worse" 
than the old one, but at least as good. Otherwise, the 
experiment of issuing a European currency would not make any 
sense at all. 
  [Winter] What would be a conceivable name for the "new" 
currency? 
  [Trichet] All parties still have to think about this 
important issue together. Regarding the name of the future 
single currency, one should proceed as pragmatically as possible 
and, if possible, ask the users for their opinion, and, respect 
it -- whenever technically possible. 
  Personally, I am saying this also with a view to the worries 
of the German population regarding the future of the mark, of 
which I know, and which, incidentally, are shared by others. 
After all, people in other countries are also emotionally 
attached to their individual national currencies. 
  This is why I did not rule out the simultaneous circulation 
of national and EU currencies during a transition period before. 
The Maastricht Treaty provides for such a period. Its authors 
also wanted to make sure that the old and the new currencies 
were equally good. Germany and France, together, should now 
make sure that this will is respected.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri by </F>
Toni Fontana in Rome; date not given: "The West Should Show 
Resoluteness, Like in Kuwait"] 
  [Text] [Fontana] Minister Fabbri, these are crucial hours 
for Bosnia. 
  [Fabbri] It is up to the UN Secretary General to make a 
decision; this time he can take this step without the Security 
Council pronouncing on the issue first. 
  [Fontana] Butrus-Ghali seems to have decided. 
  [Fabbri] The green light has not yet been given. The tragedy 
of the marketplace in Sarajevo seems to have brought some 
prospect of a slackening of the tension. There could be a 
chance that Sarajevo might be demilitarized. If there is, we 
must do all we can to find a settlement. But there is one 
nonnegotiable point: Even in the face of this potential opening, 
the West must demonstrate that it really is ready to use 
military force as well. 
  [Fontana] There are those who compare the European 
democracies' attitude toward Bosnia to their behavior toward 
Nazi Germany. 
  [Fabbri] I will note what we Italians will do. Our bases are 
ready to support military initiatives, as they did with the 
"no-fly-zone" operation. As a politician, I do not want to feel 
ashamed in a few years' time of having retreated into 
realpolitik in the face of an unparalleled tragedy, the only 
precedent for which is the Holocaust. We must show the same 
determination displayed in Kuwait, otherwise the free western 
democracies and the international community will have no excuse. 
  [Fontana] Is military intervention, in other words bombing 
the artillery posts that are pounding Sarajevo, "technically" 
feasible? 
  [Fabbri] We must use all the means at our disposal, 
including 
military means, as the foreign affairs minister has rightly 
said. Italy backs the "Juppe ultimatum." 
  [Fontana] But is intervention possible? 
  [Fabbri] There is no decisive or conclusive intervention. 
One might imagine military initiatives triggered by failure to 
comply with the ultimatum or by the UN ascertaining that the 
entire responsibility for the marketplace massacre is to be laid 
at the Serbs' door. Military experts, too, have mentioned the 
possibility of air strikes against the main "sources of fire" 
that are strangling Sarajevo, the helpless victim of genocide 
from above. Of course, we cannot rely too much on the 
investigation into the marketplace massacre; there may be no 
"technical proof," as lawyers used to call it, but there is no 
lack of "deductive proof" that the bombs were fired by the 
Serbs, as they always have been. 
  [Fontana] So what sort of military operation might be 
decided 
on? 
  [Fabbri] One might imagine air strikes against the gun posts 
and air raids in support of the UN forces, if they come under 
attack. NATO has been asked to plan an operation and it has 
done so, and the Italian bases are ready. 
  [Fontana] Would Italian planes take part in the operations 
too? 
  [Fabbri] We have been asked to provide logistic and 
operational support, which is in place and is complete. This is 
no negligible contribution, and we are ready to provide 
effective support both for the air strikes and for the other 
operations. 
  [Fontana] So there is no talk of troop intervention on the 
ground? 
  [Fabbri] None at all, at the moment. We have to see which 
targets might be knocked out with air strikes, whether the 
fighter planes have to hit "top priority" targets, by which I 
mean the gun posts, or "secondary priority" targets as well, 
munitions dumps and so on ... These are the options open to us. 
The United States is right to ask Europe to do its duty. This 
time we cannot delegate everything to the United States; in the 
face of a war on our own doorstep, Europe must play its part. 
  [Fontana] How might Italian public opinion react to the 
decision to carry out air strikes? 
  [Fabbri] The operation would be authorized by the United 
Nations and carried out by NATO. The Italians would welcome it 
as a rightful decision, there would be a sense of relief. No 
one is pretending there would be no risk, no danger, no 
consequences; but we must not forget the lessons of the thirties. 
  [Fontana] However, Moscow does not agree. 
  [Fabbri] We in the West must not allow ourselves to be 
unduly 
swayed by Russian diplomacy's benevolence toward Serbia. Russia 
has condemned the massacre in the marketplace, but we know what 
Moscow's position has been in the long Yugoslav tragedy. Let us 
take it into account without giving it too much weight. The 
West cannot betray its duty. Last but not least, I should like 
to repeat that the Italian navy and air force are ready to step 
up their humanitarian aid operations, transporting civilians and 
the wounded. Peace is not just around the corner. We must get 
ready for a massive humanitarian aid operation. 
  [Fontana] Minister Fabbri, another Italian has fallen in 
Somalia. They are shooting at the soldiers. A few days ago, 
you said that "intelligence sources" gave grounds for fearing 
this sort of thing. What is happening in Mogadishu? 
  [Fabbri] There are attacks and assaults on the UN forces, 
protest marches. The tension is mounting again. The Italians 
have carried out widespread operations confiscating weapons from 
the factions. The Somali armed groups think that once the 
western forces have left they can resume their armed warfare, 
and they are trying to get back the weapons that we have taken. 
The moment of withdrawal is the most sensitive and difficult 
moment. Unfortunately, we were expecting these fresh outbreaks 
of guerrilla warfare. We have planned withdrawal according to a 
schedule that we will adhere to. There are those who say, 
"Bring them all home immediately," but we cannot because we have 
agreed our schedule with UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] and 
the Germans, who are unarmed and are leaving with us. We shall 
be keeping our eyes wide open.

<F P=106> [Renato Caprile report: "End of High-Risk Mission"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- It has certainly been no picnic. This can 
be testified by the blood spilled so far: 10 deaths and some 40 
wounded. However, the worst could be around the corner. The 
final weeks of the Italian mission in Somalia promise to be very 
risky indeed. 
  [Senate Speaker] Spadolini has understood this and has asked 
for a rapid end to a match that started off badly, "without any 
particular willingness on our part," and got worse, "involving a 
diplomatic relationship -- including the United Nations -- that 
was always tense and painful." For some time now Defense 
Minister Fabbri has been echoing these sentiments. Some 
objective consideration is called for, independently of the fact 
that the day before yesterday 29-year-old Giulio Ruzzi lost his 
life there: Operation Restore Hope has not untied any of the 
knots in the Somalia crisis. 
  According to a report from the UN security forces, General 
Aidid is actually planning a major attack against the UN troops 
once the Westerners have left. His main enemy, Ali Mahdi -- the 
interim president whose men control the area around Balad -- 
would like to get back the hundreds of pounds of old guns that 
were seized from him by the Italians, since he is convinced that 
after 31 March he will have to defend himself -- with arms -- 
against his eternal enemies. 
  General Carmine Fiore, the commander of Ibis 2 confirmed 
from 
Balad that the danger was real. 
  "I have a problem admitting," he said on the telephone, 
"that 
the days between now and 31 March could be tough days." Indeed, 
this was predicted. Nevertheless, we were not expecting an 
attack of the kind which took place Sunday [6 February] and 
which cost the life of one of our men, but we did know that it 
would be tough. With the Somalis you must always be on your 
guard. 
  [Caprile] General, why this ambush along the Imperial Road? 
  [Fiore] I have been given an explanation. A dozen families 
all belonging to the same clan -- the Abgal, which is also Ali 
Mahdi's clan -- live in that area. Recently, a district 
commissioner (a sort of governor -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) 
was elected who appears to be favoring those in his family a bit 
too much. So where do we come in? Some people got it into 
their heads that we have sided with that man. That is why they 
shot at us on Sunday. 
  [Caprile] What do you intend to do now? 
  [Fiore] I have convened the heads of these families for a 
meeting tomorrow: I want to make it clear once and for all 
where things stand. I hope to succeed. But I repeat: With the 
Somalis you can never tell. 
  [Caprile] What will happen in Somalia once you have left? 
  [Fiore] If I had been asked that question a week ago I would 
have been able to give an optimistic reply. Now, I am decidedly 
pessimistic. I am not saying that things will end up badly, but 
I fail to see -- no matter how you look at it -- how things can 
be put back together. It is nothing more than a squalid 
struggle for power. 
  [Caprile] How is the morale among the troops? 
  [Fiore] Great, despite everything. They are well-trained men 
who are used to this kind of stress. [Fiore interview ends] 
  From Fiore we move on to Bruno Loi, the former Italian 
commander in Somalia, who was often targeted by Butrus-Ghali for 
his "attempts" to find a political solution to the Somalia 
puzzle. He has made a list of all the mistakes, 
underestimations, and omissions that can be blamed on the United 
Nations in the management of Operation Restore Hope. According 
to the commander of the Lightning Force, the most serious 
mistake was "believing, in bad faith, that the Italians cheated 
and that they wanted to increase their prestige for who knows 
what purpose." 
  According to the general, the fact that someone at UN 
Headquarters thought that the Italians were "stacking the deck" 
was a "mistake" caused by jealousy about our successes, as well 
as by the need to maintain specific interests in the region. 
The list of UN gaffes, which is signed by Loi, begins with the 
fact that "it did not believe in the mediation capability of 
Italy, which has had a presence in that area for about a 
century." Another disastrous decision was to occupy only the 
southern part of the country, thus allowing the warlords to 
continue increasing their war arsenals in the center and north. 
  According to Loi, the mission command is also responsible 
for 
"failing to fully exploit the element of surprise to disarm 
armed gangs." Initially, too much credit was given to General 
Aidid, thus failing to comply with the requirement of 
impartiality. The same Aidid was then "excessively demonized," 
when it became clear that he could not be a reliable ally. 
According to Loi, when the decision was made to carry out 
reprisals for the damage done by his militia, Aidid's political 
image was blurred and the "wildly delivered blows" against him 
ensured that he was reassessed as a genuine hero. 
  Other UN mistakes denounced by Loi were: believing that only 
the leaders of the political factions were reliable 
interlocutors; failing to take account of the fact that the 
model of democracy proposed to the Somalis was in the Western 
mold and could therefore cannot be exported to that environment; 
and the fact that no provisions were made for the country's 
economic reconstruction. Loi also accused the United Nations of 
creating an excessively bureaucratic military command and of 
putting together contingents that were too different and 
therefore unmanageable. 
  One final mistake was the reprisal for the massacre of the 
Pakistanis in June 1993. "We have never been against the use of 
force, but between a slap in the face and the atomic bomb there 
are a great many intermediate degrees of force that could be 
used effectively."

  [Text] Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri has confirmed that the 
Italian contingent in Somalia will be withdrawn by the end of 
March. Fabbri also said he is worried by the worsening of the 
conflict between the Somali factions. 
  [Begin Fabbri recording] The army and defense chiefs of 
staff 
have planned our homecoming in agreement with UNOSOM [UN 
Operation in Somalia] and have taken the needs of the other 
contingents, such as the German one, into consideration, in 
order to be able to guarantee an environment of maximum security. 
  In order to verify from the ground that everything is 
proceeding according to plan, today I made arrangements for a 
mission [as heard] under the command of Deputy Chief of Staff 
General Zoldan. I have confirmed that a naval flotilla will be 
sent offshore near Mogadishu, and that aircraft will be 
redeployed in Nairobi. We are doing everything we can think of 
to guarantee maximum security during the withdrawal phase. The 
mission is practically over. There are some technical time 
limits which are obligatory in relation to agreements that we 
have made with the United Nations. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Diakron Poll Has Silvio Leading The </F>
Charge"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi's 
entrance into politics is seen as a good thing by 62.9 percent 
of all Italians. This was one of the results of the Diakron 
poll released yesterday by Gianni Pilo, Berlusconi's polling 
"wizard" at the Forza Italia convention. In addition, 75 
percent fear for democracy in the country and 70 percent feel 
that the leaders of the traditional parties are not capable of 
dealing with the situation. Thus, just 17 percent of the 
population has any faith in the old party system and 70 percent 
want to see new men. Some 80 percent, on the other hand, are 
confident and believe that the crisis will soon be over. Pilo 
also quoted from a CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] 
poll which gave Silvio Berlusconi 52 percent of the vote and 
recorded an increase in support for Forza Italia from 7.4 
percent in September 1993 to 25.5 percent today.

<F P=106> [Report from Brussels by correspondent Nacho Hernandez] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Hernandez] For the Spanish authorities there 
must be a warning to the Serbs so that they will lift the siege 
of Sarajevo. For Foreign Minister Javier Solana the solution to 
the conflict in Bosnia is not military, although he has faith in 
the deterrent effects of a decision within NATO. 
  [Begin Solana recording] So that those responsible for the 
massacres of the last few days will receive an unequivocal 
signal from the Atlantic alliance of its readiness to raise the 
siege of Sarajevo. And I believe I can tell you that I believe 
there will be a sufficient consensus today within the Atlantic 
alliance and within the European Union for a clear, firm 
decision to be taken with regard to Sarajevo. [end recording] 
  [Hernandez] A formula could be sought for Sarajevo to be 
defined as a UN-protected zone. The foreign minister confirmed 
that there are measures to protect the troops, relocating them 
according to the proximity of the danger -- we mean the UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] forces which are now carrying out 
humanitarian aid work in Yugoslavia. We must cooperate, the 
foreign minister said, to end the siege of Sarajevo. In his 
opinion there is a sufficient consensus to make a decision and 
give a forceful response. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas 
expressed his skepticism about the efficiency of possible air 
strikes on Serb positions in ending the Bosnian conflict. Garcia 
Vargas says he understands the need for firm action on the 
international community's behalf because of the very serious 
situation in Sarajevo. However, the minister admits that for 
various military and technical reasons a possible NATO air 
strike will not be enough to lift the siege of the city. 
  [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] There is a request 
formulated 
by the international community asking for the siege to be 
lifted. The possibility exists that force may be used in a very 
selective and specific way. That is to say that lifting the 
siege without deploying ground forces would be very difficult. 
Why? Because the mortar sites cannot be attacked from the air, 
the planes cannot see them from the air. So, air strikes would 
be a warning and an expression of the international community's 
will to put pressure on the areas that right now have the most 
responsibility in the conflict, and specially on those who are 
carrying out these unacceptable massacres in the city of 
Sarajevo. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cuevas Fears Danger of Trade Unions </F>
Transferring Conflict to Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- CEOE [Spanish Confederation of Employers 
Organizations] Chairman Jose Maria Cuevas stated yesterday that 
the prime minister has adopted the only possible stance toward 
the trade unions, and added that if the trade unions bring 
enterprises into situations of extreme conflict, not only an 
atmosphere of social deterioration but also job losses will come 
about. Cuevas made this comment after meeting with Gonzalez for 
just over an hour and a quarter, together with Manuel Otero, 
chairman of the Spanish Confederation of Small and Medium-Sized 
Enterprises. 
  The employers' organization's top leader said that he is 
prepared to meet with the trade unions at any time and with any 
agenda, but he emphasized that the labor reform process is now 
in a different sphere from that of the social interlocutors. In 
Cuevas' opinion, the essential thing is that the new legislation 
is in the parliamentary groups' hands, and the system's channels 
must be respected. He therefore specified that the prime 
minister has opted for the only stance that he could adopt with 
respect to the trade unions. 
  In short, Cuevas sought to clarify his previous statements, 
which were interpreted as a refusal to negotiate. In fact, it 
is a matter of emphasis. The employers' organization chairman 
said the same thing yesterday as on previous days, but changing 
the stresses and emphases. Cuevas did not wish the 
interpretation to be made that the CEOE is being inflexible with 
the trade unions. Thus he maintained that he is prepared to 
talk with them, but proceeding from one premise: Everybody must 
accept his responsibilities, and the social agents must not 
supplant parliament. 
  "The responsibilities of the government and parliament and 
those of the social agents must be delineated. This must be 
scrupulously respected throughout this process. However, this 
does not limit at all the possibility of the parliamentary 
groups being able to receive information and proposals from 
everybody regarding these very important bills." Cuevas also 
emphasized that, in the employers' organization's opinion, the 
useful thing would be for the trade unions to come and negotiate 
now the application of the labor reform to the various sectors. 
The employers' organization views this as the real key to the 
reform, which can be more or less important, depending on its 
specific application. 
  In short, the CEOE believes that the appropriate thing is to 
turn over the page and get down to business -- namely, the 
negotiation of the collective agreements. "Let there be no 
confusion," Cuevas said emphatically at one point, "because 
there is a process here which cannot be stopped. If it stopped, 
that would damage everybody's credibility, but let it also be 
clear that the most important thing about the reform is not its 
text, or the very slight amendments which have been made 
concerning dismissal. Neither. The most important and 
significant thing is the discussion which will be held on the 
agreements on the organization of work in enterprises."

<F P=106> [Interview with President-Elect Martti Ahtisaari by Isabelle </F>
Graviere in Helsinki; date not given: "Ahtisaari: `Finland Must 
Become Active Member of European Union'"] 
  [Text] On Sunday [6 February], his son's 25th birthday, 
Martti Ahtisaari became the new president of the Finnish 
Republic with 53.9 percent of the votes compared with 46.1 
percent to his rival, current Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn. 
After a tight electoral campaign between the two candidates, 
both of whom were clearly pro-European, the success of Social 
Democrat Ahtisaari -- a diplomat who had been long removed from 
the national political arena -- seems to stem from his 
commitment to the fight against unemployment (in a country where 
over 20 percent of the population is out of a job) as well as 
the population's discontent with its traditional politicians. 
  To the population's double appeal for more jobs and more 
innovation in politics, the new president -- who will take 
office on 1 March -- has this answer: "Europe." According to 
him, only the European Union will make it possible to create the 
new economic and political framework that Finland needs. 
  However, it seems that the negotiations currently in 
progress 
in Brussels between the Twelve and four candidate members -- 
including Finland -- will be particularly tense with respect to 
matters such as agriculture, regional aid, or the contribution 
of candidate members to the Community's budget. Indeed, the 
deadline for the completion of the negotiations, which remains 
scheduled for 1 March, appears problematic despite the two 
additional sessions announced last week by the Greek presidency. 
  [Graviere] What is the first priority for Finland's new 
president of the Republic? 
  [Ahtisaari] Employment is undoubtedly our society's main 
challenge. As president of the Republic, I have a duty to help 
return Finland as quickly as possible to a state of economic 
development likely to ensure a strong reduction in unemployment 
over the next few years. To achieve this, we must, among other 
things, implement economic support measures, diversify our core 
industrial production, and become an active member of the 
European Union. 
  [Graviere] You find yourself in a "French-style" situation 
where the president and the prime minister do not belong to the 
same political groups. How will you cooperate with current head 
of government Esko Aho, especially in economic matters, where 
your analysis differs from his own? 
  [Ahtisaari] In Finland, the government is clearly 
responsible for the country's economic policy. However, I said 
that I consider the president to be responsible for the welfare 
of the citizens. My role will not be to prescribe -- even less 
so since the government enjoys the support of a parliament 
chosen by a broad majority of the Finnish people -- but to 
influence and to convince. The government can alter the course 
of its current policy; I shall work toward this goal. 
  [Graviere] You have always stressed your commitment to 
European membership. Why is this so important for Finland? 
  [Ahtisaari] The main motive is economic. The European 
economic space, of which we are already a member, does not make 
it possible to exert significant influence on the European 
construction process. We need to be present inside the European 
Union, make our positions heard, prevent decisions which run 
counter to our interests. Also, another pro-European argument 
often heard concerns security. I my opinion, this argument is 
also based on economic grounds, since economic cooperation 
strengthens security, whereas isolation fosters insecurity. 
  [Graviere] The current negotiations with Brussels are 
proving particularly difficult. Do you think Helsinki can reach 
an agreement with the Twelve before the (early March) deadline? 
  [Ahtisaari] The main stumbling block today is unquestionably 
the farming issue. Everything considered, what we want can be 
summed up in one sentence: To be granted the same conditions as 
other member states are currently enjoying, in particular with 
regard to the their less-favored regions, which indisputably 
also apply to our northern regions. However, I am convinced 
that an agreement will be found, even if the negotiation 
deadline is delayed.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Bo Stenstrom: "Ahtisaari's Long Final Dash </F>
Worked!"] 
  [Text] It was the undecided voters who yesterday 
determined the election outcome in Martti Ahtisaari's favor. On 
the day the trend was against Elisabeth Rehn, even though no 
other candidate could have offered better resistance! 
  Anyone who thinks that there will be improved employment and 
a decreased need for local government savings because Ahtisaari 
is entering office is going to be disappointed, even though 
sufficient people have felt enough of the effects of the current 
crisis not to be able to vote for an incumbent minister. 
  Rehn might have been able to strengthen her incredible 
campaign with a little more social liberalism alongside her 
concern for the activities of small businessmen; these can 
easily be reconciled. 
  Unfortunately not even the economic upswing will be 
sufficiently visible in the employment sector. On the other 
hand mistaken action could widen the gulf between a public 
sector deficit economy and a growing market economy. 
  Something important has happened on the political scene, 
even 
if Elisabeth Rehn did not make it all the way. The fact that 
she got as far as she did is confirmation of a change which will 
also have an effect on Ahtisaari's republic. 
  Despite the fact that the language question was one of the 
marginal factors that toppled Rehn, her success showed how 
widespread bilingualism and the openness that also exists among 
monolingual citizens actually are. 
  The Social Democratic Party's campaign for Ahtisaari was 
able 
to play on both strings of the language issue, and this had a 
not unimportant effect in northern and eastern Finland, despite 
the Center Party's support for Rehn. If Ahtisaari himself had 
been linguistically narrow-minded, this would have prevented him 
from becoming president -- something for the supporters of 
"Finnishness" and future presidential candidates to ponder. 
  A large -- but not large enough -- number of women were 
carried along by the "Rehn phenomenon." There is always a 
minority above the mumbling masses which leaves its mark on the 
spirit of the age. It is a sign of the times that there are now 
more girls than boys in senior high school, more women than men 
in colleges. Growing numbers of women are living in one-person 
households and growing numbers of women are shouldering an often 
heavy economic and social responsibility for their own lives. 
Why should they not help themselves to their share of political 
life? 
  More than different halves of the brain, changes to the 
traditionally so hierarchical management structures of companies 
and organizations are having their effect. With a new company 
culture women now have a more level playing field. 
  Rehn has inspired women for the March elections next year 
and 
they have at the same time become a more attractive proposition 
for the political parties, even though this will not mean that 
the problems will be easier to solve. 
  As the new president, Ahtisaari will have more to learn than 
did Mauno Koivisto. Koivisto had been prime minister at a time 
of change and he had been prime minister on another occasion. 
  Coming from what is potentially the biggest party does have 
some political advantage, but it also represents a risk. 
Koivisto had a striking degree of personal integrity -- 
something that Ahtisaari should also demonstrate for his own 
reckoning after an election campaign that does not make this 
task any easier. 
  The most important current issue is the EU [European Union] 
negotiations. Will the president give in to a EU offer or will 
he remain firm on government demands -- and to what extent? 
Will he be able to help the prime minister to keep the 
government together in the conflicting pressures that will 
surround an offer from the EU? 
  How will he deal with a possible delay to membership or a no 
to membership from the government? 
  Given the greater degree of parliamentary government and the 
changed foreign affairs arena it would be good if Martti 
Ahtisaari were to begain as soon as possible to create his own 
Foreign Affairs Council as a forum in which the party leaders 
can reach agreement on fundamental foreign policy questions so 
that they do not become a source of divisive political 
disagreements. 
  The people have had their say. Martti Ahtisaari as head of 
state is a new element in the picture. The new presidential 
election system could have divided the country if there had been 
other finalists in the second round -- now it is back to 
everyday life in a united Finland!

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Advantages and Risks of Peace Partnership"] </F>
  [Text] Having just drafted its proposal for a so-called 
peace partnership, the NATO Western alliance has set matters 
swiftly in motion. Agreements are also being offered to 
traditionally neutral countries like Sweden and Finland, in 
addition to those East European countries that want membership 
in the alliance. Russia too has received an invitation, and it 
is in principle favorably disposed to it. 
  NATO has its own grounds for regarding the participation of 
countries like Finland and Sweden as desirable. Then too, broad 
participation will reduce the former East bloc countries' fear 
that partnership is only a polite way of leaving them to fend 
for themselves. 
  Finland has to carefully consider its own advantage. A 
partnership arrangement with NATO is not a first-class security 
policy issue for us. If we take the right action, we can derive 
a modest benefit from it, but one worth aiming for. If we act 
clumsily, we will end up a member of the wrong group in the 
wrong context. 
  Before the end of last year, the government was still 
vacillating to a great extent, but now it seems to be making up 
its mind. The government Foreign Affairs Committee said on 
Wednesday [19 January] that it in principle takes a positive 
view of the goals of this partnership since the NATO initiative 
is aimed at stabilizing conditions in Europe, not creating new 
dividing lines. 
  A report is now being drafted on the matter. Cooperation, 
especially with Sweden, is considered to be important, and our 
own contribution is seen as lying primarily in peacekeeping, an 
area in which Finland has experience. According to the 
committee, Finland is not interested in military cooperation 
proper. 
  Whether partnership is a NATO waiting room for the East 
European countries or not, Finland's proper place is clearly not 
on the same bench. Finland's current interests do not lie in any 
military alliance, but in the European Union (EU) membership for 
which we have applied. The EU will also be the first and most 
natural frame of reference of our future cooperation on security 
policy. 
  However, the mere idea of a "peace partnership" need not 
frighten people. After all, the term itself is a typical product 
of the military policy poster paint shop, bland and without 
content. Nevertheless, if Russia and most of the former 
socialist countries agree on their own arrangments and if our 
neighbor, Sweden, is also interested, it will be worth Finland's 
while to be among them, if only because of their discussion 
contacts and the publicity that NATO meetings bring with them. 
  The wisest thing for us to do is to bear in mind that haste 
makes waste and be selective about choosing those forms of 
cooperation that are suitable for us in particular. Peacekeeping 
is a very appropriate area even if the whole way it operates has 
to be reconsidered following the painful experiences of the 
Balkans and Somalia. If the network of partnership agreements in 
time achieves an improvement in the flow of information and 
understanding across Europe's old dividing lines, so much the 
better. 
  The idea of a peace partnership arose in NATO when the East 
European countries wanted security guarantees from that 
organization that it could not provide. The initiative is as as 
far as NATO's unity and political determination will go at the 
present time. The East European countries will have to be 
content with it. Partnership promises Finland a new form of 
cooperation that is not very central, but which will 
nevertheless make it possible for us to attain some limited 
advantages.

  [Text] The Swedish Government might accept air strikes in 
Bosnia despite the fact that Swedish UN soldiers are present in 
Bosnia. This was said by Ulf Dinkelspiel, minister of foreign 
trade and European affairs, at a meeting of the EU Council of 
Ministers today. Dinkelspiel also said that it is not the time 
to withdraw the Swedish soldiers even though air strikes could 
lead to retaliation attacks from the Bosnian Serbs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Wachtmeister To Leave Politics"] </F>
  [Text] New Democracy party chairman Ian Wachtmeister is 
resigning. Nor will he run in this fall's elections. The 
reason is that he does not feel he has the party's support for 
the tough, straightforward policies he wants to pursue. 
  "New Democracy is moving toward something we already have 
too 
much of -- vote maximization," he said in a television interview 
on Saturday [5 February] evening. 
  By this he means that too many people in the party are 
keeping an eye on the opinion poll figures. They are attempting 
to put forward proposals that will win as many votes as possible 
instead of pursuing the right policies. 
  He admitted that the criticism from Bert Karlsson, New 
Democracy's deputy chairman, is one of the reasons for his 
resignation. 
  "If you cannot lead the party in the right way then you 
should resign." 
  Wachtmeister believes that New Democracy will run in the 
election without him, but "it will probably be with what in part 
at least is a different program." 
  Bert Karlsson does not want to lead the party himself. And 
party secretary Marianne Ostlund is shocked. 
  "I have difficulty in envisaging a future of which Ian is 
not 
a part," Marianne Ostlund told DAGENS NYHETER. 
  In recent opinion polls New Democracy has been dangerously 
close to the 4-percent threshold for representation in the 
Riksdag.

  [Text] The government maintains an extremely reserved 
position on Rauf Denktas' sincerity and believes that its fears, 
which have already been conveyed to the UN secretary general, 
should be erased by the Turkish Cypriot leader himself during 
the talks. This came out in a statement this morning by the 
government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, who stressed that 
President Kliridhis is still awaiting clarifications he 
requested through his letter to the UN secretary general. 
  Mr. Kasoulidhis recalled that in the past too, Denktas 
appeared to have accepted some things, while in practice it was 
established that this had not been the case. 
  Mr. Kasoulidhis further noted that at the president's 
private 
meetings with the political leaders, DISI [Democratic Rally], 
AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People], and DIKO 
[Democratic Party] maintained that the Greek Cypriot side cannot 
refuse to go to the talks.

  [Text] In a statement at the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation program "Enlargements" last night, Gustave Feissel, 
the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in 
Cyprus, reiterated that the confidence-building measures [CBM's] 
aim to facilitate the promotion of the basic goal -- an overall 
solution. He added that when he refers to Varosha he means the 
entire fenced-off area, which will be opened up in two phases: 
The first phase will begin two months after the package is 
approved and the second at a date to be agreed upon later. 
  Speaking at the Larnaca Rotary Club last night, Feissel said 
the financing of Varosha's reconstruction and the travel 
documents that Turkish Cypriots will use are two issues that are 
still pending and the two leaders will need to decide on this. 
  [Nicosia CYPRUS NEWS AGENCY in English at 0916 on 9 February 
carries a Larnaca-datelined report on Gustave Feissel's 8 
February speech to the Larnaca Rotary Club, which adds the 
following: "After outlining the CBM's, Feissel explained that 
the advantage with the reopening of Varosha is that its 
inhabitants and property owners will be able to return. It will 
also increase tourism capacity on the Greek Cypriot side by 
about 15 per cent of what it is now and will provide a 
`significant stimulus' through what is envisaged would be at 
least one billion dollars worth of investment in order to bring 
back the area into a reconstructive form. 
  ["For the Turkish Cypriots, he said, the benefits will be 
jobs and the opportunities for services during the 
reconstruction phase during both the opening of Varosha and the 
NIA, Nicosia International Airport. `It is estimated that this 
process could generate as much as 9,000 jobs, of which both 
sides would benefit,' Feissel said. 
  ["He also said the tourism industry in the Turkish occupied 
areas, which is less than one tenth of that of the Greek Cypriot 
side, will open up as there will be direct airlinks to all 
destinations." 
  [CNA adds: "Responding to questions, the U.N. envoy said the 
reports of the U.N. teams of experts on the package serve only 
to `shed light.'" 
  [CNA continues: "Asked with what papers the Turkish Cypriots 
will travel abroad, Feissel said the Turkish Cypriots already 
travel to the United Kingdom and the United States 'by using a 
piece of paper which is given to them by the British and 
American embassies' and which substitutes for passports. There 
are ways of doing things without creating difficulties for 
either side," Feissel said.] 
  The international community believes that implementation of 
the CBM's will open the road for talks on an overall Cyprus 
solution. This is the conclusion we draw from statements by the 
ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members in 
Nicosia on the "Enlargements" program. U.S. Ambassador Richard 
Boucher reiterated that the measures are a unique opportunity 
for the two communities to cooperate in a way that has been 
impossible for the past 20 years. He said that people who focus 
more on benefits for the other side than on the prospects that 
are being created are the ones impeding the CBM's. 
  Russian Ambassador Boris Zenkov described the current phase 
of the Cyprus issue as very critical. He said the CBM's will 
help keep the Cyprus issue alive, adding that the entire issue 
will be lost if they are rejected. 
  British High Commissioner David Dain said he considers the 
measures as a way to overcome the current status quo and create 
a new atmosphere of cooperation toward an overall Cyprus 
solution. 
  French Ambassador Gerard Pavret de la Rochefordiere said 
Cyprus' current division is unacceptable and should end as soon 
as possible. He added that the CBM's are a catalyst that will 
facilitate discussion on the substance of the set of ideas that 
will follow. 
  Chinese Ambassador Chen Zhenyou said he was satisfied 
because 
both sides accepted the CBM's in principle and expressed 
readiness to examine ways for its implementation. 
  Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said the CBM's 
philosophy is to create some activity and utilize it to discuss 
the substance of the Cyprus issue. He added that the measures 
are neither an overall Cyprus solution nor a partial one, but 
they offer possibilities to Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots 
to meet and communicate, thus proving unfounded Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas' argument that there is lack of confidence. 
Mikhailidhis said that talks on the substance of the Cyprus 
issue will begin as soon as an agreement on the CBM's is reached 
and they begin to be implemented. 
  Speaking at the same program, Mikhailidhis said that if an 
agreement is reached on the CBM's, the road to the European 
Union will open up because it will be persuaded to set a date 
for the beginning of accession negotiations. He said: If 
efforts fail due to Turkish rejection, the UN Security Council 
will be asked to find alternative procedures. Therefore, during 
the entire course of the talks the Greek Cypriot side must be 
consistent and persuasive. 
  Asked whether he is optimistic about the outcome of the 
talks, Mikhailidhis said that unfortunately there is no 
indication that the Turkish side has changed its stance.

  [Text] Lord Finsberg, rapporteur for the Cyprus problem to 
the Political Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe 
Parliamentary Assembly, has stated that he observed a sincere 
goodwill on the part of the Turkish Cypriots with regard to 
assisting the UN secretary general in his efforts to assemble 
the confidence-building measures package. Lord Finsberg left 
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] after concluding 
his contacts. 
  In a statement he issued to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News 
Agency], Lord Finsberg stressed that he had observed 
considerable goodwill on the Turkish side. Stating that 
constructive and useful exchange of views were conducted while 
he was in the TRNC, Finsberg said he observed that the Turkish 
side assisted the UN secretary general in assembling the 
confidence-building measures. 
  Stating that north Cyprus would benefit from successful 
negotiations, Finsberg stressed that he encountered the same 
goodwill in north Cyprus as he did in south Cyprus. Reiterating 
his decision to advise the COE Parliamentary Assembly members in 
favor of hearing the Turkish Cypriots' voice, Lord Finsberg 
added that work will be undertaken to enable the TRNC political 
party leaders' participation in the parliamentary assembly. 
  Reiterating that it is impossible to fill the chair 
representing the Turkish side for the time being, Lord Finsberg 
added that he believes that the TRNC political party leaders 
will be invited to the parliamentary assembly once progress is 
made on the confidence-building measures and on a solution to 
the Cyprus issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>
  [Text] The Cypriot Government has prepared a list of issues 
and questions to discuss at the proximity talks. The list 
includes issues of security and legal aspects that may create 
danger from the pseudostate's direct or indirect recognition. 
The United Nations has also submitted a list of issues in 
preparing the agenda for the talks that will begin late next 
week. 
  According to reliable I SIMERINI information, the government 
will raise the following issues and questions: 
  First: The simultaneous opening of Varosha and Nicosia 
Airport. The president will set a period of 18 months for the 
implementation of these measures. 
  Second: There must be no occupation army around the 
Famagusta 
fenced-off area. This falls under the "security" aspect. 
  Third: Access to the fenced-off area must be possible from 
the free areas. The Greek side wants a road through Dherinia 
but there is also talk of a passage through the British bases 
(in Ayios Nikolaos). This is also a security issue. 
  Fourth: The issue of travel documents. The passports that 
the Turkish Cypriots will use when traveling from Nicosia 
Airport and how they will be stamped. 
  Fifth: Who will have control of the sea area around Varosha? 
  Sixth: How will the Cypriot Government transfer control of 
Nicosia Airport to the United Nations? 
  Seventh: The Cypriot Government will not pay even one cent 
to 
repair the airport and Famagusta's neighborhoods that will be 
placed under UN control. 
  The United Nations yesterday submitted their own list of 
issues. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate 
special representative in Cyprus, and UN Political Adviser John 
Paul Kavanagh yesterday met President Glavkos Kliridhis and 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas. The key points, as they 
have described them, concern security issues raised by both 
sides, access to the fenced-off area, movement from and to 
Varosha, passports, stamps, authorities and how they will be 
transferred to the United Nations, who will have the right to 
land and take off at the airport (Turkish Cypriot Airlines), and 
timetables.

  [Text] A reliable source today said that proximity talks on 
the confidence-building measures [CBM'S] based on the three 
documents submitted by the UN secretary general to the two sides 
will begin in Nicosia on 17 February. The source added that Joe 
Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in 
Cyprus, is expected in Cyprus on Saturday [12 February] 
accompanied by a group of UN experts. The same source clarified 
that it is not the same group of experts who visited Cyprus 
earlier and prepared reports on the fenced-off area of Famagusta 
and the Nicosia International Airport. 
  Referring to the UN secretary general's two-month deadline 
for the Nicosia-New York talks to conclude, government spokesman 
Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the government believes this is the 
maximum period that should be allocated, adding: Discussion on 
the substance of the Cyprus issue should begin immediately 
afterward. 
  The spokesman said that negotiations are now being held with 
the UN secretary general's representatives to prepare a list of 
points described as key positions--the answers to questions such 
as how the Nicosia Airport will operate and how the fenced-off 
area of Famagusta will be opened up. Kasoulidhis added that 
this list will remain open until late next week for suggestions 
to be added by both sides. 
  Answering another question, the spokesman said the National 
Council members will have the opportunity to express their 
positions on the points in the list before it is finalized.

  [Lefkose], Feb 8 (AA) -- President Rauf Denktas of the 
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus said on Tuesday [8 February] 
that the whole of Cyprus can not enter to European Union (EU) 
before we say "yes." 
  Denktas, evaluating EU's message to Greek Cypriots which 
said 
if the concerned sides reach an agreement, pre-studies will 
begin on Cyprus' membership to the EU, said the two sides living 
in Cyprus should hold separate referendums on the issue and 
should apply for the Union's membership. 
  Denktas answering questions on the issue said accepting 
Greek 
Cypriots as the responsible "nation" was a mistake adding that 
the whole Cyprus cannot enter to EU before an agreement between 
the two sides.

  [Text] The Free Democratic Party [FDP] has decided to wage 
a campaign against Britain due to that country's stand toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. 
  In a statement he issued today, FDP leader Ismet Kotak said 
that his party wants Britain, which is on the side of the 
wrongdoers in Cyprus and Bosnia-Herzegovina, to get up and leave 
the bases in Cyprus. Kotak urged the Turkish Cypriot people to 
take a stand against every British action in Cyprus, stressing 
that there is no room for a third state in Cyprus. 
  The FDP leader pointed out that the world must condemn the 
stand before clear massacres of those who are opposed to the 
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. He urged the world to 
protest the present British Government.

Venizelos said the communique issued by the European Union [EU] 
Council of Ministers, which conferred in Brussels yesterday, 
does not contradict Greek positions. He said the firm Greek 
view--not just the government's--that Balkan countries should 
not get involved in any war remains firm. He added that Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias' handling of things was calm and 
responsible. [passage omitted] 
  Asked whether the Greek presidency contacted the Serb 
leadership immediately after the EU foreign ministers communique 
was issued, Venizelos said Greece has the capability to contact 
and pressure all sides for a solution. He added: This 
capability is not limited to Serbia.

  [Text] Athens, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Greece, current holder of the 
revolving EC presidency, was congratulating itself Tuesday [8 
February] for having managed the Bosnian crisis coolly in 
Brussels and keeping advocates of force under control. 
  "Greece has given proof of its sang-froid and 
responsibility, 
as opposed to the hysterical improvisations made by many 
(participants)" in the wake of a weekend mortar attack that 
killed 68 people in Sarajevo, government spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos said. 
  "The government has reason to be satisfied (...) that no 
step 
was taken towards supporting airstrikes." 
  Greece presided over a meeting of EC foreign ministers in 
Brussels on Monday, which turned down French proposals to issue 
an ultimatum to Serb forces besieging the Bosnian capital. 
  There has been growing international pressure for immediate 
airstrikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) 
following the bloody attack on a Sarajevo market. 
  The EC meeting called for lifting the siege "by all possible 
means, including aerial." According to Venizelos, this implied a 
rejection of any immediate intervention. 
  Greece is alone among EC member states in its pro-Serb 
sympathies, and has backed Serb arguments that the attack was a 
Moslem provocation. 
  In Athens on Tuesday, there were headlines saying "Stop 
Airstrikes" and "No to Military Intervention" in newspapers 
supporting the Socialist government of Andreas Papandreou. 
  Greece, the only Balkan country in the EC, claims that 
military involvement would unleash an inferno and that a 
negotiated settlement is the only answer. 
  Foreign minister Karolos Papoulias has reaffirmed that 
Athens 
would not allow its NATO bases at Preveza, opposite the island 
of Corfu, to be used for any air operation and would withdraw 
its NATO airforce personnel. 
  "It would be a symbolic decision without any operational 
importance," a European military expert close to NATO told AFP. 
  Greece is at loggerheads over the issue with fellow NATO 
member Turkey, which is sympathetic to the Bosnian Moslems. 
  But despite earlier objections Athens has now agreed to join 
Turkey in attending a meeting of countries bordering on the 
former Yugoslavia, called for Wednesday by international peace 
negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report from the "Views" column: "A `Solution' </F>
of Massacre"--capitalization as published] 
  [Text] IT IS TRAGIC that at the end of the current 
century, which has been marked by the horror of two world wars, 
that human blood does not yet matter. 
  IT IS TRAGIC for the European Union and the international 
community to express abhorrence at the bombing of civilians in 
Sarajevo while, at the same time, they threaten a massacre 
through air raids against the same place where the blood was 
shed. 
  IT IS TRAGIC for the bombing, which will certainly kill 
people and cause bloodshed and will most probably mean an 
extension of the Balkan war, to be regarded as one of the 
"measures" that "would be a first step toward realizing the 
European Peace Plan." 
  IT IS TRAGIC to express abhorrence for the ongoing 
bloodshed, 
to discuss peace plans at the table while under the table arms 
are being passed to all the belligerent parties. 
  IT IS TRAGIC for people who desire peace to play games 
behind 
their backs and the same people pay the price with blood, the 
blood of civilians, the blood of children. 
  IT IS TRAGIC for human logic not to find a solution, the 
solution that the people desire, and in the name of these people 
to commit crimes with the same people as victims. 
  IT IS TRAGIC for everyone, both Europeans and non-Europeans, 
to know that here are the Balkans, and the Balkans are the 
powder keg of Europe and still, those who make any decisions for 
air raids and the like do not realize that they are paving the 
road to a new Vietnam. 
  So, IT WOULD BE tragic if in the end the international 
community did not avoid "the major evil" to which it will be led 
with the air raids by ignoring the value of human life and the 
blood that will be shed. 
  FOR THIS "major evil" the expression of any abhorrence would 
be the glorification of hypocrisy and cynicism. Greece, since 
both the government and the parties agree, ought to react in 
every way against such a "solution." The presidency of the 
United Europe offers to Greece additional possibilities.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Between Peace and War"] </F>
  [Text] The massacre of civilians in Sarajevo last Saturday 
[5 February] took Washington and the strong ones in the European 
Union [EU] by surprise at a time when, after two years of 
regressions and contradictions, the Western powers seemed to be 
formulating a joint course toward the confrontation in Bosnia: 
The United States had made it clear that its vital interests 
were not at stake in the Bosnian confrontation, Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl had opposed any form of military intervention either 
by air or land, and Britain saw its initial reservations 
justified. 
  The initial reaction by the West to the Saturday tragedy 
proved that the dynamic of a blunt clash, of a "dirty war," 
could at any time upset the priorities and planning of 
diplomacy: The open wound of the battlefront in the besieged 
Bosnian capital means not only terror and blood for the civilian 
population but, at the same time, it is a time bomb capable of 
blowing up all that has been achieved through difficult 
negotiations among the three opposing sides. Therefore, defusing 
this time bomb becomes an urgent priority. The fact that not 
only the international community but also the Serbian leaders in 
Bosnia seem to realize this is a message of optimism. 
  At the same time, it is obvious that every time the strong 
ones in the West are obliged to deal with the feasibility of a 
military intervention in Bosnia, an open war front, they add to 
the repercussions of every decision they make the potential 
confrontation fronts in the Balkan south. 
  It is clear that even hostilities on the most limited scale 
against Serbian targets would give a "green light" to all those 
who like to revise the status quo that was formulated with the 
Bucharest treaty in 1913: The vision of a Greater Albania and a 
Greater Bulgaria, and Ankara's irredentist legacies [ipothikes] 
in Bulgaria would cease to be the "worst possible scenario" of 
the NATO staff maneuvers on paper and would become the result of 
an uncontrolled Balkan complication. 
  Of course, the planning with which the "12" foreign 
ministers 
yesterday approached the dramatic developments in Bosnia does 
not mean that the nightmare of a general conflagration in the 
Balkans has been removed once and for all. This likelihood will 
remain open until a final settlement, with the guarantee of the 
international community, of the pending issues that emerged from 
the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation.

Ladoues: "Alain Juppe's European High Mass in Athens"] 
  [Text] After taking over the presidency of the European 
Union with a bang, Greece has reverted to a behavior more in 
keeping with its partners's expectations. Forgotten, the 
acrimonious exchanges between Greek European Affairs Minister 
Theodore Pangalos and his French and German counterparts. Alain 
Juppe, whose comment on the return of PASOK [Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement] to power had been a scathing "how people 
forget!," came to Athens on Thursday [3 February] to celebrate 
the high mass of European solidarity. "Full French support to 
the Greek presidency": The French foreign minister did not fail 
to embrace the soothing European discourse. Just like German 
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Helmut Schaefer, who came 
a few days earlier to insist that there was not "the shadow of a 
cloud" between his country and Greece. Invectives against 
Germany seen as "a country with brutish power and the brains of 
a child" were seemingly just as faraway as their author, 
troublemaker Pangalos, gone to Africa... 
  Since 1 January the Greek Government has done all it could 
to 
be accorded its good behavior credentials. Over and done with, 
the dream -- openly flaunted by Greek officials until the end of 
December -- of replacing the embargo against their Serb ally 
with one against the Bosnians, should they refuse to compromise 
at the peace table. Theodore Pangalos will only repeat that 
"the use of violence must stop" in the former Yugoslavia. He 
hardly even questions any more the principle of air strikes, 
which he judges would be fruitless and ineffective. "As the 
Americans and the French found out in Indochina!," he taunted on 
Thursday. Consigned to oblivion -- for the duration of the 
presidency? -- Athens' rhetorics on the Republic of Skopje's 
resolve to call itself Macedonia. Athens seems to have sized up 
the decision of six of its European partners to establish 
diplomatic relations with the former Yugoslav republic in 
December. 
  Since early January, the Greek Government has shown some 
eagerness to have its presidency taken seriously and to complete 
by 1 March the Union enlargement process as regards four 
countries: Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. While it seems 
unlikely that the four rounds of talks can be completed in time 
for these countries to sign the Union treaty in early 1995, as 
scheduled, Greece appears determined to advance the process as 
much as it can. To this end, it has called two meetings of the 
Council of Foreign Ministers for 21-22 and 25-26 February in 
Brussels. Athens clearly expects to benefit should one or 
several of these countries successfully complete the fast-track 
membership process, but this would also afford it an opportunity 
to push for the admission of a candidate particularly dear to 
its heart: Cyprus.

  [Text] Commenting on a recent statement by the Turkish 
Foreign Ministry alternate spokesman accusing our country of 
alleged violation of the Muslim minority's human rights, Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Kostandinos Bikas said that the government 
condemns Turkey's attempt to intervene in Greek decisionmaking. 
  The spokesman said: Greece is a just state and fully 
respects human rights. Turkey is neither concerned nor 
interested in alleged violations of the Muslim minority's human 
rights in Greece. It is merely seeking excuses, encouraging 
nationalistic extremism, distorting situations and facts, and 
unhesitatingly using the minority issue, obviously realizing the 
damage done to Greek-Turkish relations and stability in the 
region.

<F P=106> [Article by Notis Papadhopoulos: "Andreas' Maneuver and </F>
Dialogue with Skopje"] 
  [Excerpts] In recent days, [Prime Minister] Andreas 
Papandreou has repeatedly used the expression "irony of history" 
when addressing the Skopje issue. This phrase faithfully 
reflects reality. [Former Prime Minister] Konstandinos 
Mitsotakis, who wanted to settle the Skopje issue any old way, 
failed to achieve his goal because of Andonis Samaras' internal 
resistance in the New Democracy (ND), the Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement's (PASOK) "hardline" stance, and public opposition. The 
PASOK government, which inherited an issue rife with "faits 
accomplis" is thus compelled to follow a defensive policy on 
this issue, since Greece lost the possibility of a veto it held 
in the European Union (EU) following Skopje's entrance into the 
UN. 
  However, why did the PASOK government postpone the procedure 
of UN intervention, which the ND had agreed to? 
  From the very beginning, the PASOK government was opposed to 
the name of "Macedonia" for Skopje. This position was developed 
by Mr. Papandreou both during political leaders' meetings and in 
his pre-electoral campaign. While the UN procedure that the ND 
had accepted reinforced the three conditions demanded at this 
time by Mr. Papandreou from Mr. Gligorov, it resulted in the 
name of "Nova Makedonia." The former government had proposed to 
the UN secretary general the name of "Slavomakedonia," which 
Skopje rejected. Both names used the term "Macedonia," and 
therefore were contrary to PASOK's expressed policy. Hence, the 
PASOK government expected nothing from that UN procedure. 
  Which are the three conditions set by the government to come 
to the negotiating table with Skopje? 
  The first is changing the preamble of the Skopjean 
Constitution, the second is a clear statement by Skopje 
regarding the inviolability of Greek borders, and the third is 
the removal of the Veryina star from Skopje symbols. [passage 
omitted] 
  Why did Mr. Papandreou mention at this time that the name 
issue is included in the negotiations as well, since, as he 
himself stressed, Greece will not recognize a state with the 
name of "Macedonia"? 
  Mr. Papandreou's tactical maneuver was undertaken to bring 
Skopje to the negotiating table. And, of course, because the 
differences between Greece and Skopje center essentially on the 
name. Therefore, no dialogue could take place under a UN aegis 
if--at least in theory, the name issue was not one of the 
elements of this dialogue (something that, according to 
information, the UN transmitted to Athens through the United 
States). Additionally, Mr. Papandreou wants to make clear that 
if the Skopjeans agree to the three conditions, this does not 
mean that the differences between them and Athens cease to 
exist. Simply, the issue of the name can be settled at a later 
time. Yesterday's statement by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Theodhoros Pangalos is characteristic: "We can live without the 
immediate settlement of the name issue." 
  Does a dialogue in which Greece negotiates--but does not 
discuss the name issue--mean that it is aimed at normalizing 
relations between the two countries, with the name issue in 
abeyance? 
  As long as the Skopjeans are not convinced by Greek 
arguments 
(political and economic) to change their name and the present 
impasse on the name persists, then naturally the dialogue with 
Skopje has no other objective than to promote a peaceful 
coexistence between the two countries. 
  Could the Greek side exert pressure on Skopje--on a 
bilateral 
level--so that it will change its name? 
  Greece could use a number of severe measures against Skopje, 
such as not allowing goods to reach this country by closing the 
border or the Salonica port. However, this measure would have 
negative consequences for Greece now that Skopje is a UN member 
and has been recognized by every country in the world. This 
would show that Athens is a destabilizing influence in the area 
and flouts international legality. Secondly, it would create 
enormous legal problems for Greece within the Community, for 
Athens has no right to obstruct intra-EC trade. Thirdly, because 
Athens-Skopje relations will become very tense, with Skopje 
henceforth depending on Bulgaria, Albania, and Turkey, which 
would like to play a primary role in the region. If Greece 
closes the border, it will throw Skopje into the arms of the 
countries nourishing designs on it. On the contrary, if a 
hardline stance had been adopted since the beginning of 
Yugoslavia's dissolution, perhaps things would be different 
today. 
  So, is Greece condemned to live peacefully with Skopje? 
  It is. Because stability in the region mandates the 
continued 
existence of the statelet, given that Skopje's neighbors (with 
the exception of Greece), nourish territorial ambitions against 
it. However, the dismemberment of the statelet (between Serbia, 
Albania, Bulgaria) would both strengthen these countries and not 
change the borders in the area, thus opening Pandora's box.

  [Text] Ankara, Feb 8 (A.A) -- Premier Tansu Ciller on 
Tuesday [8 February] sent a message to the U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, French President Francois Mitterand, German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, and British Prime Minister John Major on the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Ciller in the message conveyed her impressions to the 
leaders 
she viewed during her visit to Bosnia on Feb 2 saying "the 
developments in Bosnia up to now showed that the aggressor was 
allowed to gain territory by force." 
  The message went on saying "the aggressive powers continue 
their actions to devastate the multi-cultural structure of 
Bosnia and a mortar attack of Serbians which killed 68 people 
and wounded 200 others targeted the Bosnian civilians. She 
added that the attack was a challenge to all civilization values 
and initiatives for a peaceful solution. 
  Ciller described the recent letter of the UN General 
Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali sent to NATO which called for an 
air operation and protection of Sarajevo against Serbian attacks 
as "late but favorable." 
  Ciller said such an air operation will protect Sarajevo from 
Serbian attacks and will give an open message to the aggressors. 
  She said if NATO fails to take necessary measures after this 
letter, it will lose its credibility.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev has arrived in 
Ankara. Aliyev, who arrived in the capital at a time when 
Russia is forging its new policy on the Caucasus, is trying to 
reestablish trust between his country and Turkey. 
  [Begin Metin Corabatir recording] Aliyev landed at Ankara's 
Esenboga Airport this morning to eliminate Turkish apprehensions 
of the Azerbaijan Administration that emerged after the removal 
of Elchibey as president, and to reestablish Turkey in the 
balance of power against increasing Russian demands. 
  That Aliyev gave importance to this visit was obvious from 
the very large delegation he brought with him. The delegation 
was made up of his daughter, six ministers, the leader of 
Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, numerous officials, 
intellectuals, and artists. Two planes were needed to transport 
them. 
  Diplomatic sources noted that Russia, which failed to 
prevent 
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to Turkey last 
month, also tried to prevent Aliyev's visit. 
  Acting in line with the new protocol, President Demirel, who 
was prime minister when Aliyev was the leader of Nakhichevan and 
from whom Aliyev received great support, did not wait for the 
formal reception in the afternoon at the Cankaya presidential 
palace and instead went to Esenboga to welcome his Azerbaijani 
guest. 
  The official talks, which the two sides headed by Demirel 
and 
Aliyev started, basically aim at renewing trust. 
  During the welcoming ceremony Demirel said that Turkey will 
always support Azerbaijan. 
  Russia's latest proposals on the Karabakh problem are at the 
top of the agenda to be discussed at the talks. Oil 
prospecting, transportation, and the sale of military equipment 
are also to be discussed at the Turkish-Azerbaijani talks. 
  During the talks Turkey will convey its wish to Aliyev that 
the democratic process in Azerbaijan not be disrupted. [end

  [Text] Ankara, Feb.8 (AA) -- Premier Tansu Ciller said 
today that the plan formed during the Brussels meeting of the 
permanent representatives of the NATO a day before, could only 
be an "intermediate formula." 
  Support grew for a plan to demilitarize the Bosnian capital 
Sarajevo after a weekend mortar attack of Serbs killed 68 people 
and pushed the West closer to military intervention in Bosnia as 
the European Union backed the use of NATO air strikes to relieve 
the Serb-besieged city. 
  Ciller told journalists, before the executive board meeting 
of her True Path Party (DYP) that, "what's needed to protect 
these people is to conduct an air strike or to remove the arms 
embargo." 
  On the visit she and Pakistani Premier Benazir Bhutto paid 
on 
February 2 to Sarajevo, Ciller said "a violence of humanity was 
underway in Sarajevo. There, we called on the world to first 
support the basic right, the right to live of people, if we are 
to mention human rights." 
  "The decision taken by the permanent representatives of the 
NATO is a favorable steps, but not a sufficient one. 
  "The decision gives the impression of making a compromise," 
she said. 
  "I hope the plan does not prolong the existing situation 
there. Otherwise, this will be written to history not only as 
the disgrace of humanity, but of Europe," she added. 
  "The agreement reached in Brussels could be assessed as one 
which consumes time. And we hope it does not," she said.

  [Text] German Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth has 
stated that violence and terror cannot achieve any political 
aims and added that only stopping the bloodshed can achieve the 
development of cultural identity. Concluding her contacts in 
Turkey, Suessmuth returned to her country. Suessmuth and 
Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly, held a joint news conference at Ankara's Esenboga 
Airport. 
  Stating that very useful exchange of views were conducted, 
Suessmuth said that primarily the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] terrorist organization issue was discussed. 
Explaining that views were also exchanged on Turkey's cultural 
mission in the Asian countries, the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, 
and the situation of Turks living in Germany, Suessmuth said 
that there was agreement on the PKK terrorist organization 
issue. Recalling that the PKK was banned in Germany, Suessmuth 
added that terror and violence cannot achieve political aims and 
that the development of cultural identity can be achieved only 
after bloodshed is stopped. 
  Suessmuth explained that during her visit, the two 
countries' 
parliaments had established working groups to put into order the 
citizen and voting rights of the Turks living in Germany. 
  Cindoruk, in turn, said that Turkey's aim -- since Ataturk 
-- 
is to unite with Western democracies thus becoming a European 
country. Explaining that Turkish and German parliamentarian 
workings groups were established during the guest speaker's 
visit, Cindoruk stated these groups will make every effort to 
solve the problems existing between the two countries. 
  Cindoruk further stated that Turkey is not only a country 
which aims at democracy but it is a country which is getting on 
with democracy and added that this gives his German colleagues a 
feeling of security.

  [Text] Turkey will purchase 19 MI-17 helicopters from 
Tatarstan. The helicopters will be assigned to the General 
Command of the Gendarmerie Forces. It has been ascertained that 
the talks on the purchase of the helicopters have entered their 
final stage. In a statement to INTERFAX, Aleksandr Lavrentyev, 
director of Russia's most important helicopter manufacturing 
installations in Tatarstan, has said that Turkey decided to 
purchase 19 MI-8 and MI-17 helicopters for its gendarmerie 
forces in 1993. Stressing that another Turkish delegation 
visited Kazan early in January, Lavrentyev said that it held 
talks for the purchase of several more helicopters in addition 
to those that Turkey planned to buy for $65,000,000. 
  The helicopters Turkey will buy for its gendarmerie forces 
are capable of flying 225 km per hour. They can fly and land on 
any terrain 4,000 meters above sea level.

<F P=106> [Sezai Sengun report: "We Have Become Interested in Junk </F>
From Russia"] 
  [Excerpt] Turkey has reached an agreement with Russia to 
buy 110 BTR-80 armored vehicles from that country, regardless of 
the fact that Ankara has decided to replace the engines and 
transmission units of the BTR-60 armored vehicles it purchased 
from Russia some time ago. The decision Turkey made to change 
the engines and transmission units of the BTR-60 vehicles, which 
are used in southeastern Turkey, was made only six months after 
the vehicles were put into service. Consequently, the decision 
to buy Russia's BRT-80 armored vehicles adds to Ankara's string 
of wrong decisions. 
  Meanwhile, Turkey has also reached an agreement with Russia 
to buy 19 MI-27 general purpose helicopters. The preliminary 
agreements for the purchase of Russia's armored vehicles and 
helicopters were concluded when Lieutenant General Teoman Ekan, 
under secretary of the Ministry of National Defense, visited 
Russia in January. The cost of the armored vehicles and 
helicopters was also established in the talks Erkan held with 
the officials in Russia. Turkey will pay $1,650,000 for the 
armored vehicles and $65 million for the helicopters. The 
agreements will be signed when Minister of National Defense 
Mehmet Golhan visits that country. 
  Recalling that the BTR-80 vehicles have diesel engines, 
several arms experts have said that a very important factor has 
been overlooked. Stressing that the BRT-80's will be used 
against the Kurdish Workers Party militants in southeastern 
Turkey, they noted that they are very wide and cumbersome 
vehicles with limited maneuvering capability. Meanwhile, the 
question of how successful the Turkish pilots will be in 
Russian-made helicopters, which are not as advanced as the 
helicopters manufactured by the Western countries, has prompted 
anxiety. The experts have stressed that the technology used in 
Russian-made helicopters and the supply of spare parts may 
create a problem in the future. [passage omitted]

"The PKK Is Reluctant To Leave Zhalah"] 
  [Excerpt] A team from HURRIYET has succeeded in traveling 
to the Zhalah Camp in northern Iraq, which was bombed by Turkey 
last week. The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] militants were 
reluctant to show the current situation of their camp to the 
correspondents. They claimed, however, that only seven of their 
colleagues were killed in the air attacks and noted: "We are 
not afraid of bombs. As you have observed, we are still here in 
the camp." 
  We reached the vicinity of the camp with great difficulty. 
We arrived in an area that had many craters created by 
exploding bombs. That area was 500 meters from the Zhalah Camp. 
One of the PKK militants who blocked our way identified himself 
as the person in charge of the camp. He claimed the Turkish 
newspapers are being used as an tool, and said we could not 
enter their camp. The correspondents said: "If you claim the 
Turkish Government is lying, then you should allow us to enter 
to determine the true state of affairs." However, the PKK 
militants were determined not to allow us into their camp, which 
had been destroyed by the military aircraft. 
  Two buildings close to the entrance of the camp seemed to be 
intact. However, the main camp was hidden deep in the canyon. 
The PKK militants refused to show us the results of the bombing 
raids. 
  Although the PKK militants claimed that no damage was caused 
to the camp, a resident of Shele village, which is near the 
Zhalah Camp, said: ``The Turkish aircraft dropped many bombs. 
It was like hell. Even Saddam Husayn was not bombed by the 
United States to that extent. I saw buildings collapse." He 
also said he was in the camp when the Turkish aircraft attacked. 
  It has been ascertained that the bombing of the camp 
frightened nearby villagers a lot. However, residential areas 
and civilians around the camp were unharmed except for some 
individuals who were smuggling contraband goods on mules. The 
journalists did not observe any damage in the villages around 
the camp. 
  The PKK militants claimed that the Turkish aircraft dropped 
their bombs from an altitude of 20,000 meters [as published] to 
stay out of range of their antiaircraft guns. They also claim 
that they shot down two aircraft, but were unable to describe 
exactly where they crashed or to provide any evidence to confirm 
their claim. 
  Several Kurdish sources in northern Iraq have said: "The PKK 
militants have not been completely evicted. Although 
significant damage has been caused in the camp, the PKK 
militants are still there. However, they are demoralized. The 
air attack was a very serious deterrent measure." 
  It has been ascertained that one of the villagers who 
transported goods from Iran to northern Iraq on mules was 
injured. The air operation caused significant anxiety in 
northern Iraq. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, Feb 9 (AFP) -- NATO sought Wednesday [9 
February] to reach a consensus on airstrikes against the Bosnian 
Serbs, with sentiment growing for giving them a warning to 
withdraw their artillery from Sarajevo, alliance sources said. 
  A NATO source said "a majority, not everybody" in the 
16-member alliance was in favour of putting the Serbs on notice 
following the mortar attack last weekend that killed 68 people 
in Sarajevo's central market. 
  But NATO requires unanimity to take a decision and Greece 
has 
come out strongly against the airstrikes. Canada has also 
expressed strong reservations for fear of reprisals against its 
troops serving in Bosnia. 
  In Washington a U.S. official said the United States would 
ask its NATO allies to authorize bombing raids against the 
Bosnian Serbs unless they pulled their heavy weapons back from 
the hills around Sarajevo. 
  The NATO source said two proposals were on the table at a 
meeting of NATO ambassadors here, one by the United States and 
France and the other by Britain. Both contained the notion of a 
warning but avoided the word ultimatum. 
  The aim would be to give the Serbs seven to 10 days to 
withdraw their heavy weapons at least 20 kilometers (13 miles) 
from the predominantly Moslem Bosnian capital. The Bosnian 
army's artillery would be put under international control. 
  The source expressed optimism for reaching a consensus. 
"Last 
night we were closing together," he said. 
  The alliance was to consider a request by UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to authorise the use of its 
warplanes for a punitive action to deter future attacks such as 
Saturday's slaughter in Sarejevo's market. 
  But NATO, stung to action by the worst incident in the 
22-month-old conflict, appeared to have a broader purpose in 
mind: lifting the siege of Sarajevo immediately as urged Monday 
by the European Community. 
  In Washington Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
emphasised that the military threat was paired with a vow to 
step up pressure on Bosnia's three warring factions to reach a 
political settlement. 
  Christopher said the military and diplomatic initiatives 
were 
"very closely interrelated. They are interlocked. One does not 
take the place of the other. They go together." 
  Clinton approved the twin-pronged response to the grizzling 
[as received] shelling of Sarajevo's market on Tuesday. 
  During the day he talked by telephone to French President 
Francois Mitterrand, French sources said, but declined to give 
details. 
  Clinton also telephoned Canadian Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien, and tried but failed to contact British Prime Minister 
John Major, said a senior administration official who asked not 
to be identified. 
  Canada and Britain, the largest contributors to the UN 
Protection Force in Bosnia after France -- which has deployed 
6,000 blue helmets, are reluctant to back Paris' call for an air 
strike, fearing it might expose their own troops to Serbian 
retaliation. 
  Washington hopes to find "an agreeable position" with Paris 
on a minor sticking point relating to the distance to which the 
Serbian artillery should pull back from Sarajevo, the senior 
administration official said. 
  But as far as an agreement within NATO in the Brussels 
meeting, "I don't know if this will happen tomorrow," he added. 
  The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John 
Shalikashvili, warned a Senate committee on Tuesday that air 
power was limited. 
  "Air power alone can not bump someone into a peace treaty," 
he said. 
  He said NATO's North Atlantic Council would discuss "whether 
you can use limited air power not to stop, but to reduce, the 
chance of a tragedy that occurred in Sarajevo the other day."

  [Begin Collenette recording] We haven't changed our position 
since the prime minister announced it last month, which was that

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Thomas Mayer; </F>
place and date not given: "`Practitioners Will Ultimately 
Create Path for EU Accession'"] 
  [Text] [Mayer] Minister, great significance has been 
ascribed to the foreign ministers' meeting scheduled for 
Tuesday. What will be so decisive about it? 
  [Mock] Each session that is now held will be significant, 
because we are getting close to the end of the negotiations. 
Thus, the session is, naturally, of particular importance. 
  [Mayer] There are still fundamental differences on important 
basic positions. One issue is the single market, which the 
European Union requests immediately, while Austria is against 
it. Do you expect flexibility on this position? 
  [Mock] Yes. In the sphere of agriculture we will have to 
focus on specific structural questions: For example, what about 
the farmers in mountain regions, the milk quota, and similar 
issues? One will try to advance on a pragmatic course and not 
discuss the basic concepts for the fifth time. 
  [Mayer] How will that look in concrete terms? 
  [Mock] I think that Brussels will become more flexible. 
Life does not work on the basis of purely theoretical teachings. 
  [Mayer] Where will Brussels have to give in? 
  [Mock] For me there can be no doubt that there will have to 
be concessions regarding the protection of the food industry and 
regarding the farmers. Under what title this will take place is 
irrelevant. It is ultimately the practitioners who will create 
the possibilities for membership. 
  [Mayer] Where will Austria give in? Will you accept 
principles of the Union such as the reduction of border checks 
in the single market or the regulation that bans discrimination? 
  [Mock] If we want to join the European Union because we 
expect advantages, then one has to realize that one joins a 
community that is guided by certain principles. We must accept 
the issue of abolishing national borders because it is one of 
the Community's essential principles. The abolition of 
discrimination is also an important fundamental principle. This 
will, of course, not remain without consequences; The validity 
of the eco-point system [regulating transit traffic through 
Austria], for example, will also apply for bilateral traffic. 
Nevertheless, it will not prevent interim solutions. 
  [Mayer] Brussels can expect that we will not oppose these 
principles, while Austria will ask for financial compensation in 
return. Is this interpretation correct? 
  [Mock] Yes, particularly in the agricultural sphere. 
  [Mayer] Many people in Austria complain that they no longer 
understand the situation regarding the permanent succession of 
positive and negative information they get. Have the 
politicians not failed in this respect? 
  [Mock] If one has to deal with these issues on a daily 
basis, then there is a danger that one becomes incomprehensible. 
That is a problem. After all, the people are doing something 
else than thinking about political problems all the time. 
However, there is always also the danger of becoming a 
manipulator by presenting things that are, in reality, 
complicated in too simple a way. It is a tightrope walk. 
  [Mayer] How can one avoid mudslinging before the referendum? 
  [Mock] There is a fair chance that we will not see the usual 
political squabbling, that people are aware that this decision 
is of national importance. 
  [Mayer] Would you propose a fairness agreement before the 
referendum? 
  [Mock] Well, it is a possibility. I do, however, hope that 
we can do without one. 
  [Mayer] Let me ask you a personal question now: Would 
completed Austrian EU membership be the achievement of a 
personal objective for you? 
  [Mock] It is of vital importance for me because I do not 
want Austria to play second fiddle, but, according to its size 
and history, to get a fair chance to participate in the 
decisionmaking process in a historic process. 
  [Mayer] That does not quite answer my question. What does 
it mean for Alois Mock personally if he can put his signature to 
the membership treaty? 
  [Mock] It means a great deal to me because a lot will then 
have been achieved for the future of the country. I do admit 
that this has always been a special desire of mine. 
  [Mayer] Would you then still have different aims for your 
political life, for example in the EU Commission or the United 
Nations? 
  [Mock] No, I am not thinking of that. Besides, one does not 
have to work a certain number of hours each day until the very 
last day of one's life. At one point, one might also take life 
more easily.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Heinz Klaus </F>
Mertes, Helmut Markwort, and Claus Larass in Bonn; date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mertes] Another 250 days to go before the 
Bundestag elections, which will be held on 16 October. They 
will be the political highlight of super election year 1994. 
Then we will know whether Helmut Kohl's chancellorship will end 
after 12 years, or whether he will continue to lead German 
politics at home and abroad. Or will a decision be made 
earlier? Chancellor Kohl, how sure are you that you will not 
lose power before election day? 
  [Kohl] I must say that I do not understand your question. 
Parliamentary elections will take place on the day mentioned by 
you. Do you expect a revolution or what? 
  [Mertes] Elections will take place in Lower Saxony on 13 
March, for example. If this should turn out to be a defeat for 
the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], 
this means that men like Biedenkopf will raise their voices 
throughout the country the following Monday, 14 March, asking 
whether it is still possible to win the Bundestag elections with 
the chancellor. 
  [Kohl] Well, you know, I have been in office for such a long 
time, and I have won so many elections. I also lost elections. 
The procedure is always the same. If election results are 
positive, we are all responsible. Yet this does not only apply 
to the CDU/CSU, but to all parties. If election results are 
bad, only a few are responsible. One must get used to that. I 
am still in office, and I intend to wage an intensive and very 
dedicated election campaign. I also intend to win the elections 
with the help of numerous good friends and with the support of 
the citizens. 
  [Markwort] Yet polls have never been so poor for the CDU/CSU 
and you prior to elections. You are facing two major tasks, and 
I would like to know how you want to tackle them. First, you 
have to overcome despondency in the CDU/CSU. There are many who 
say that we have nearly lost the elections. Second, you must 
bring about a change in public opinion. Do you have a special 
message, a special thesis, or a decision? 
  [Kohl] First of all, I would like to tell you that I am not 
particularly impressed by opinion polls. 
  [Markwort] Yet the public is impressed. 
  [Kohl] This is another matter. Let me first answer the 
first part of your question. If you remember the polls before 
the first free elections in the GDR, which took place barely 
four years ago, if you remember what was said and written in 
January and February four years ago -- the CDU and I were not 
given the slightest chance. Still, we scored a remarkable 
victory. 
  [Mertes] Well, there will not be another German unification. 
  [Kohl] I am not speaking about German unification. I am 
talking about the first free elections to the People's Chamber. 
In elections in Lower Saxony, which took place a little later, 
we did not achieve good results either. One should not forget 
that. We will know the results on election day. Until then, we 
must fight for every vote. It is stupid to speculate about 
coalitions -- about a possible grand coalition -- for example. 
This is not my style. I want to continue the work with the 
coalition consisting of the CDU/CSU and Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP]. I see good opportunities for that, and I will 
advocate this idea and fight for it. We have accomplished a 
great deal of good work in the past few months. Step by step, 
we have taken more positive decisions for the future than any 
other German government within such a short period. We must now 
make this clear to the public. We will receive a positive 
response. As far as despondency in the CDU/CSU is concerned, 
you will have to live with that. We are a German party, and the 
German parties are all characterized by enormous changes of 
mood. If everything goes well, they are up, and if things do 
not work out so well, they are down. We have enough supporters. 
There are always a few who assume controversial positions, but 
that is not so important during an election year. Those who are 
not loyal to the party must know that they will later have to 
face the consequences within the party. Thus, I am quite calm 
in view of possible developments in the coming months. 
  [Mertes] Is this a threat? 
  [Kohl] This is not a threat but a statement. 
  [Mertes] Are you not afraid of a domino effect, that is that 
election results in Lower Saxony might influence the general 
mood if the CDU/CSU does not achieve good results? 
  [Kohl] How can you know the results at this point? The 
election campaign has not even started. It will be opened in 
the next few days. Let us first wait and see how the voters 
will decide and not talk about results that do not even exist. 
I refuse to do so. 
  [Larass] Still, I would like to discuss this issue. 
According to scenarios that are being drawn, the results for the 
CDU/CSU will certainly not be overwhelming in Lower Saxony, as 
far as one can see at this point. For the following European 
elections, preconditions for the CDU/CSU are not optimum either. 
You might be held responsible for that. 
  [Kohl] I want to stress that you are talking about 
forecasts. Your forecast for the European elections reminds me 
of the last European elections. Polls predicted miserable 
results for us, but we still emerged as the strongest party. We 
achieved a much better result -- which is difficult because of 
the low voter turnout -- than many assumed. Talking about these 
things -- during the previous European elections, there were 
also voices among the public and the party leadership who 
claimed that something would have to happen after the elections. 
I opened the session at the time and asked who had something to 
say. Nobody replied. 
  [Larass] Let us leave forecasts aside. Token strikes are 
currently taking place in Germany -- 100,000 or 200,000 are 
taking to the streets every day in a sensitive economic 
situation. What can you tell these people, without interfering 
in the wage negotiations? 
  [Kohl] What I can and want to tell them is that this is not 
really the right time to trigger large-scale disputes. All 
those concerned -- employers and employees -- should get 
together and find sensible solutions, which is possible. The 
other large trade union -- the trade union of chemical workers 
--has just shown that by adopting very sensible wage 
settlements. I am not only referring to the extent of the wage 
increases but also to the numerous details that allow more 
flexibility. If one discusses wages today, one must know that 
priority is to be given to safeguarding jobs and creating new 
ones. Then we can talk about the extent of increases. What I 
can say is that we are jointly launching an initiative designed 
to create jobs. Efforts are required in the sphere of politics 
and of the economy. Comparing the situation with other 
countries, I would like to tell you the following: We have just 
amended the job promotion law to create more part-time jobs. 
This measure will quickly lead to new developments. If we 
compare our situation with that of other countries, we see that 
every third employee works part-time in the Netherlands, every 
fourth in Sweden and Great Britain, and every fifth in Japan, 
but only every seventh in Germany. In the old laender, 2 
million full-time employees would prefer to work part-time. In 
the new laender, their number is 500,000. If we had the same 
number of part-time jobs as in our neighboring country, the 
Netherlands, we could offer jobs to another 2 million. This is 
a sensible instrument to improve the situation quickly and in a 
sensible way. 
  [Markwort] Is there still too much bureaucracy? 
  [Kohl] No, not at all. The law is absolutely okay. It 
grants additional social security to those who look for 
part-time jobs. Action is now required. 
  [Markwort] People would like to work part-time in all 
spheres, including the public sector. Do you believe that 
changes are possible there? 
  [Kohl] Your question is absolutely justified. At this 
week's second cabinet meeting, I initiated a number of measures 
in this respect. We want to achieve a breakthrough in the 
public sector -- at least at the federal level -- as soon as 
possible. The same applies to the laender and communes. We 
might set a clear sign in 1994. The government will do 
everything it can. 
  [Mertes] The wage dispute in the metalworking industry has 
been triggered by the following question: Is a reduction of 
real and nominal incomes and of social benefits possible and 
reasonable? 
  [Kohl] Why reasonable? We must view the situation in our 
country realistically, and at the state level, we must act in 
the same way as in our private lives. If you are facing the 
situation in your private life that you do not have a higher 
income, you must try to make ends meet. The state must behave 
in the same way. We must and want to help our compatriots in 
the new laender. This will cost the taxpayers between 140 and 
150 billion German marks [DM]. This capital will be raised in 
the west through taxes and revenue and transferred to the new 
laender. Thus, developments will be made possible there from 
which we all benefit. This can already be felt at this point. 
We can spend this sum only once. As far as new indebtedness is 
concerned, we have reached the limit. We are not only concerned 
about debts, but the stability of the mark is also at stake. 
This is the most important thing. If we want to keep the mark 
stable, we must keep the budget in order. Thus, we cannot spend 
more, but we have to save an additional DM26 billion in 1994. A 
number of expenditures that we would like to carry out must be 
postponed in all spheres. Every individual must do what the 
state is doing, particularly since the general income situation 
in Germany -- though poverty exists in some places in Germany -- 
makes that possible. I plead in a very realistic manner for a 
tight budget policy on the part of the state and general 
solidarity with a view to the new laender. 
  [Larass] The people would possibly like to participate 
and, even though not gladly, they would participate in certain 
savings. This is all right. But one sometimes has the 
impression that politicians also take a delight in negative 
figures. That is to say, as soon as an austerity round is 
announced and pushed through, there is the next one, the next 
paper is presented and increases are made here and there. Can 
this not be concentrated? I think that it is simply becoming 
too much for the people. 
  [Kohl] You are quite right. But it is strange if we 
mutually put the blame on each other. Not only the politicians 
have to answer for the fact that reports and considerations that 
have not yet been made are, of course, published. However, I do 
not want mutual scolding here because in principle you are 
right, but, simply speaking, the course of things cannot be 
concentrated. 
  My philosophy is rather simple. I am saying that the citizen 
has a wallet, out of which he has to pay everything: municipal 
taxes, whether the garbage collection, the sewage bill, the road 
tolls, or something else. He has to pay this or that in the 
land and he also has to pay federal taxes. 
  [Larass] There are many families who are saying: We cannot 
pay any longer. It need not be the majority. But if one talks 
to the people, a large part of them says: We simply cannot do 
it any longer. The husband works, the wife works, they have two 
children and they say: It is no longer possible. 
  [Kohl] This certainly happens. But we have to have a look 
at the specific case, the income situation, social welfare, and 
all that belongs to it. I do not accept a generalized answer. 
  [Larass] At least, the fears are very great. One has the 
feeling... 
  [Kohl] This is something completely different. 
  [Larass] ...that the people also get little support from 
politicians. 
  [Kohl] Well, I have to tell you that politics is not there 
for everything. If there are fears, there are many reasons for 
them, in the fewest cases these are really political reasons. 
It has meanwhile become a practice in our country that someone 
takes credit for every problem that has been positively settled 
and politics is blamed for every problem that is currently not 
solved or can perhaps not yet be solved. 
  [Larass] Let us take a positive sign. BMW is buying the 
Rover works in England. Is this already a sign of a slow 
improvement, that the situation of the German economy is better 
than it is sometimes said? Is this actually a sign of hope or 
is it...? 
  [Kohl] First of all, this is very good because I think that 
it is very good that in the European Union [EU], in the economic 
development -- I explicitly include the United States -- we also 
make investments on this side and on the other side and that we 
closely cooperate economically, if possible. But it is out of 
the question, this can be perceived by everyone -- without being 
a prophet, we are -- though slowly -- on the point of getting 
out of the economic low. The problem is again that we will get 
out of the economic low more quickly than we will be able to 
reduce unemployment because, according to all experiences, this 
is a process. There is no doubt that 1994 will be a better year 
from the economic point of view. You only have to listen to the 
stock exchange gurus and to have a look at what is going on 
there. There is no doubt about that. We have a stable 
currency. We have an enormous success that is left unmentioned 
almost everywhere. The fact that we are further reducing the 
inflation rate, that this year not four but three will be before 
the decimal is the best social policy that exists because high 
inflation rates burden the small incomes, including and above 
all the retirees. I think that this is one of the great 
achievements because in 1990, in the economic and monetary union 
with the former GDR, an enormous inflation wave was 
internationally predicted for Germany. It did not come. Four 
was too much and now we are reaching a reasonable ratio. 
  [Markwort] As far as the topic of negative headlines is 
concerned, I also do not want to blame anybody. But I think 
that, for example, the parties themselves were responsible for 
all the to-and-fro regarding the nursing-care insurance. Almost 
every holiday has already been under discussion. Is that not a 
matter where the chancellor -- let us get down to business, Mr. 
Chancellor -- convenes a meeting? Do the people not expect him 
to put his foot down? 
  [Kohl] But all that has been done. It is not a question of 
putting one's foot down. 
  [Markwort] But without any result. 
  [Kohl] Excuse me, this is a question of majorities. If the 
CDU/CSU had the majority in the Bundestag, the law would have 
been adopted long ago. But the voters decided on the majorities 
in the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. Thus, one cannot say that 
it depends on the chancellor. Regarding this matter, I am the 
one who can understand it least. I think that it is completely 
absurd that, considering the Germans' dimension of leisure, we 
have to quarrel over two days. What is the problem? The 
problem is that the number of older people is dramatically 
increasing. It is very gratifying that the people are 
healthier, also in their old age. However, if I know that in 
our time, in these years, we have 3 million citizens who are 
older than 80 years and that for 30 years we have been among the 
two or three countries with the lowest birthrates, that in many 
big German cities more than 50 percent of the owners of 
apartments are single and this behavior will not change in this 
respect, the conclusion is that we have to do more for nursing 
care, by the way, not only for the people who are now 80 years 
old, but the relevant development will continue. 
  By the way, the idea of the nursing-care insurance is also 
overdue. It has been under discussion for two decades. It has 
also been neglected. This belongs to what I said before. What 
a strange quarrel we are now having! On an average, we have 30 
days of annual leave. Then we have 10 to 13 holidays. If this 
is taken together, we have more holidays than in any other 
country in Europe. So we can really discuss the provision of 
two days for the securing of old age. 
  [Markwort] This has been discussed for ages. I think that, 
on the whole, it contributes to the weariness concerning 
politics and that journalists are relatively innocent in this 
respect. 
  [Kohl] I am not in favor of abusing journalists. First of 
all, this would be wrong because it is a sweeping judgment. 
There are neither stereotyped politicians nor stereotyped 
journalists. I am of your opinion. But if you provide me with 
the majority in the Bundesrat, the business will be over today 
at noon. I think that this quarrel on the back of the older 
people who are currently the generation of the people to be 
nursed -- by the way, this may be on our backs tomorrow -- is 
absolutely unacceptable. I also do not understand it. By the 
way, the majority of the population does not understand it 
either because I am sure that we would have a clear majority for 
it if a referendum were held on it. In view of 30 days of leave 
and 10 or 12 holidays, this can be settled. At the moment, 
however, the matter is stalemated by completely nonsensical and 
innumerable protective positions. 
  [Mertes] I think that, with Minister Ortleb's resignation, 
the 10th minister has left your cabinet since 1990. Will there 
soon be an 11th, that is, Minister Bluem, who has connected his 
political fate with the nursing-care insurance? 
  [Kohl] Not at all. But I really ask you not to compare 
colleague Ortleb, who is ill, suffered from this disease, 
recovered again, and made great efforts, and, by the way, is a 
really great man, with political events. What has to be said in 
connection with colleague Ortleb is something completely 
different. This depresses me. It is not connected with 
ministers. You can also observe it with my colleagues in the 
Bundestag, that is, that everything is unbelievably more 
difficult here for the men and women who come from the new 
laender, who had a completely different life, and who suddenly 
assumed political offices and responsibility after 1990 because 
they do not have any antecedents and experiences and have great 
difficulties in the merciless everyday political life, which 
cannot always be understood by outsiders, and they often cannot 
carry the burden. This is a very dismaying experience for me. 
  However, as far as the resignation of a large number of 
ministers is concerned, this is definitely no different from 
anywhere else in the world or in former governments, considering 
Helmut Kohl's 12 years as chancellor -- it will be 12 years in 
the autumn. When you talk about the number, you have to say how 
many governments have been elected and newly constituted in the 
meantime. 
  [Mertes] Let us once again come back to the nursing-care 
insurance. Do you proceed on the assumption that it will still 
be adopted now? In other words, if if is not achieved in this 
legislative period, what social policy projects of the past four 
years where progress has been made in the welfare state can you 
present to the voters? 
  [Kohl] Well, first of all, I want to say once again that, as 
far as this special question, which is very important to me 
personally in view of the older generation is concerned, I will 
try to do what is humanly possibly to achieve it. I cannot 
predict anything now in this respect. 
  Having a look at the past four years, I first of all have to 
say that these are the four years of German unity. Of course, 
the focus of social policies has been in the new laender in 
these four years. This is only right because we have always said 
that they are our brothers and sisters. And now we are asked 
whether this is true. Here I give one example for all: In early 
1990 a retiree in the new laender, which were still called the 
GDR at that time, had a monthly pension of 450 to 500 East 
German marks after 40 years of work. The same retiree with 40 
years of work now gets DM1,250 this month, in January 1994. You 
can see from this difference that there have been fundamental 
changes in the field of social policy. 
  [Mertes] It is the same everywhere, Mr. Kohl. What you 
say is plausible and one can check this calculation. 
Nevertheless, approval of your government is declining strongly 
in particular in eastern Germany. 
  [Kohl] We would like to wait for the elections to see about 
that. 
  [Mertes] How do the people react when you go to the east? 
  [Kohl] Excellently. I have to distinguish where I am -- 
whether I am going there, whether I have been announced 
properly, whether the appropriate extras have been deployed, and 
whether the television cameras have put the demonstrators in 
their places in time. 
  [Mertes] Who do you think is deploying these extras? 
  [Kohl] Well, that is quite easy; there are no problems. You 
will find the very old structures that are active there. Then 
there are mobile demonstration groups, which are sent out from 
certain places. There are a lot from the west. Quite often I 
meet the same people again and again. And certainly there are 
also people who are spontaneously outraged. However, if the 
four of us sitting here got into a helicopter now, went to any 
place, which you yourself specify from the air, where people are 
walking in the streets, for example, in the weekly market, and 
we walked among the people -- I experienced this just last week 
again in a town....[sentence as heard] 
  [Markwort] Nevertheless, the polls -- I have to get back to 
that -- which are done scientifically, are believed by 
everybody, and also influence the mood, are bad for you, in 
particular in the new laender. Is this not tragic, that the 
chancellor of unification, who essentially contributed to 
freeing the people, suddenly has a bad reputation among those 
whom he freed? 
  [Kohl] First of all, I do not like these terms at all. 
  [Markwort] Well, it is a little exaggerated. 
  [Kohl] I do not like it at all. I really look forward to 
the elections in the new laender on 16 October with great calm. 
I have said that I will stand in all the places where I stood 
in 1990 and I will hold rallies everywhere. And then we will 
see what the people really say. For instance, how do you know 
who the pensioners will vote for, whom we just discussed and who 
know from very personal experience what their lives were like 
and what they are like now? How do you know -- and this is 
something that is no longer included in the discussion at all -- 
in what way the people have not forgotten the most important 
thing, namely that they are genuinely free citizens in a free 
country? 
  [Markwort] Of course, I do not know and I cannot ask 
everyone. 
  [Kohl] That would be good. 
  [Markwort] But I do rely on the premise that prominent 
opinion research institutes, which talk to 2,000 
representatively chosen people, correctly present the prevailing 
mood. Of course, one can turn the mood around. After all, an 
election campaigner must be able to do that. However, I do rely 
on them to tell me what the mood in the country is like. And 
these are floating voters, who do not have any firm ties with 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] or the CDU; they do 
not yet have any experience with voting. 
  [Kohl] I agree, and therefore, because things are as you 
correctly describe them, I suggest that you wait calmly, just as 
I am. 
  [Larass] What do the people tell you when you meet them in 
the market place? What do you hear from them? 
  [Kohl] I hear the following: First of all, a very high 
percentage -- both young and old people -- are grateful for 
German unification. This gratitude has not declined at all. 
This is a very important basic feeling. They say: We thank 
you that unification has come. 
  At the moment this is even increasing, because the insight 
that things might get worse again in Moscow is intensifying the 
fears that we discussed earlier. These fears are now also 
giving rise to the insight that there were, perhaps, only a few 
months during which the door was open and this guy -- myself -- 
made the best possible use of them. 
  Second, there is another thing: People are now suddenly 
discovering that many people lied, also in Germany, people who 
did not want unification at all. It is now increasingly being 
discovered who, in reality, had actually defected to Honecker, 
either directly or indirectly. The people also know that I did 
not defect. Some considered me to be an idiot, because I 
advocated the old-fashioned ideas of freedom and unification. 
  Third -- I have just had a discussion in the street -- the 
people naturally see that there will be flourishing landscapes, 
that the basic idea is not wrong at all, but that there will 
only be a difference of a few years. And then I explain to 
people where I made a mistake, namely that in 1990 I naturally 
assumed -- just as anybody in the world; I do not know anybody 
who thought differently -- that the Soviet Union would remain in 
existence and not collapse overnight, as it did a year later, 
that is, that the economic relations between the then-GDR, the 
new laender, with the Soviet Union would remain as they were, 
that we did not have to replace the old structures overnight, 
that we could catch up slowly on the world market with other 
products of the companies of the then GDR, the subsequent new 
laender, without this dramatic reduction of jobs. This was my 
mistake. I admit this. 
  In summer 1991 I was still negotiating with Mikhail 
Gorbachev 
about the delivery of goods worth between DM30 and DM40 billion, 
and now we have DM4 billion this year. And when I say this, I 
get very much understanding for it. 
  [Markwort] We are talking business here with the 
chancellor, but I would like to ask the historian Helmut Kohl a 
question for once. How do you assess the new insights from the 
1970s, the coming to terms with the past of the crumbling Brandt 
government, and the influence that the Socialist Unity Party of 
Germany [SED] had on the SPD? 
  [Kohl] Well, I think that what is emerging now is extremely 
shameful, and I would like to make it quite clear that I do not 
feel any joy at all about it. I think it is shameful, also 
regarding our relationship with our foreign partners and 
friends, that it is now becoming clear how many people here in 
the west had defected intellectually, how many people had long 
given up on the unification of the nation and had betrayed the 
wonderful idea of a unified fatherland just because of 
advantages gained in everyday politics. I find that very bad. 
  I predict that this feeling will greatly intensify among 
many 
people, the feeling that in a stormy period of German history 
many -- perhaps not all, I do not even know whether there would 
be a majority, as public opinion research does not help me in 
this -- had long given everything up. I am not happy about 
that. By the way, this will find its way more and more into the 
minds of the people in the new laender. I can see this from the 
letters that I get every day. 
  In my toast during Honecker's visit I said nothing that was 
different from what I had always said. I never held 
negotiations or talks or ordered talks to be held by others with 
the goal of making concessions. 
  There were two questions that were of existential importance 
for me out of my understanding of human rights as a German. 
First, the demand Honecker always made right at the beginning, 
namely that the small documentation center -- it really was not 
large -- in Salzgitter be abolished, which recorded human rights 
violations in the prisons of the then GDR as far as they became 
known. He always wanted to get rid of Salzgitter. I always 
felt that it was a scandal that the SPD-ruled laender stopped 
financing Salzgitter -- it was only a few marks -- to do 
Honecker a favor. The office was then maintained by the other 
laender. 
  Second, and this is the central issue, that Honecker's other 
demand, namely that we should accept two citizenships, was taken 
into consideration to such an extent. This is something quite 
different from a juridical procedure, nor is it the same as 
holding official talks. This meant depriving 17 million Germans 
of their original citizenship. 
  And those who do not want to understand at all what this 
meant must know that it was decisive also for the collapse of 
the GDR regime that in summer 1989 the Hungarian Government, the 
communist Hungarian Government, which did not want to continue 
such a Stalinist policy in Honecker's style, said that there is 
one German citizenship and, therefore, we will let the Germans 
go, regardless of where they come from. And this was the 
beginning of the end. In Prague and in Hungary the Germans 
could not have crossed the borders if they had had GDR 
citizenship. The matter would also have been different in this 
respect. 
  Therefore, it is a shame and a scandal that it was possible 
that people held negotiations on this matter. 
  [Mertes] How would you explain the fact that the 
reassessment of the past -- of the most recent past -- is 
assuming so much significance again? Has this something to do 
with election year? 
  [Kohl] No. 
  [Mertes] Do you see a risk that mud slinging might be 
triggered by old files? 
  [Kohl] There is no such risk. I believe it would be stupid 
to wage an election campaign characterized by mud slinging. 
Somebody who runs for the president's office and whose party 
has massively participated... 
  [Mertes] You are referring to Johannes Rau. 
  [Kohl] Yes. He himself was not so much involved, but he 
watched his party attacking a candidate from another party, the 
CDU/CSU, a candidate from the new laender, from Dresden, with 
the most disparaging and, in my view, unacceptable remarks and 
statements. If somebody presents himself as the candidate of 
German unity and as the candidate of the people in the new 
laender, too, while pointing out that we do not need a candidate 
from the new laender because he will safeguard their interests, 
he must face the question, not about a sin committed as an 
adolescent, but about what happened in the past 10 years. The 
candidate made no positive contribution in his land at the 
office for the registration of GDR crimes, for example. After 
all, he was and still is minister-president. As a social 
democrat, his supreme goal should be to fight for humanity, for 
justice, and for the poor. Second, I have not heard any 
statement from him massively rejecting different citizenships. 
He did not do so in his capacity as candidate for chancellor, 
either. As far as the files are concerned, I did not look for 
them, but they simply exist, and he will have to deal with them. 
  If I remember what questions I have had to face constantly 
during my political career since I became party chairman -- 
during the past 21 years -- I do not know why others simply 
ignore the facts. 
  [Mertes] Have we seen the campaigner Kohl, who wants to be 
tough, in the past three minutes? What will be your personal 
style during the election campaign? 
  [Kohl] I will not change my style during the election 
campaign. I will not be a different person then. I will talk 
to the people as I always do. I will advocate and explain my 
policy. I will not run around with a sledge-hammer all the time 
and bang it on people's heads. I will not put up with offense, 
and I will certainly not offer my left cheek if somebody hits me 
on the right one. I would like to stress this here as chairman 
of the CDU. [unintelligible interjection] This need not be a 
duel. You know, this has something to do with the fashionable 
word feelings. I do not like this word at all. It sounds 
terrible and does not mean very much. Yet if we are talking 
about my feelings, I think it is very good for my health if I do 
not swallow everything. 
  [Markwort] There are other issues, apart from the election 
campaign. You have visited the United States, and you 
frequently talk on the telephone with Yeltsin. How come you 
have always had a good relationship with Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and 
the U.S. Presidents Reagan, Bush, and now Clinton? Your 
relationship with Clinton seems to be excellent. 
  [Kohl] It is difficult for me to answer this question. You 
should ask those affected. You know, I have always tried to 
apply the principles of private life to political life, too. I 
have never advocated separate political morals. Experience has 
taught me several things. I adopted two very important 
sentences from my mother. She used to tell us children: In 
life, you must always be aware that one meets people at least 
twice. Thus, during the first meeting, you must behave in a way 
that you can still look them straight in the eye the second 
time. The other sentence is: Visit people when they are not 
doing so well. If they are doing fine, they have lots of 
friends. You can see that very well in politics -- on elections 
days, after election defeats. Many people act in accordance 
with this principle. 
  Let us take the example of Boris Yeltsin. Boris Yeltsin 
knows that Mikhail Gorbachev is my friend. Yeltsin is also my 
friend. I have never tried to hide this fact. He knows very 
well that George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev did more than 
anybody else to bring about German unity. It would not have 
been possible without the two. I believe that a man must be 
able to tolerate somebody else's friendship with those who are 
no longer in power. 
  I can give you another fantastic example of fairness that I 
experienced on Monday morning this week [31 January]. When I 
arrived at Bill Clinton's office, and after he had welcomed me, 
the first thing that he said was: I think it was great of you 
to arrange this ceremony for George Bush, his predecessor and 
competitor during the election campaign, yesterday evening. It 
is true that no other American did more for German unity and the 
Germans than George Bush. During the ceremony, George Bush was 
presented with the Great Distinguished Service Cross of the FRG, 
awarded by the federal president. During his term of office, 
Bush did not accept any decorations. Thus, I organized a small 
ceremony for him and the secretary of state and conveyed thanks 
in a speech. This did not have a negative impact on my 
relationship with Bill Clinton. Quite the contrary, as you can 
see. He is quite a normal man with human feelings for 
togetherness. 
  [Markwort] Apart from your friendship with Clinton, U.S. 
politicians have leveled massive allegations that the Europeans, 
including the Germans, are not doing enough to stop human rights 
violations at their front door -- in the former Yugoslavia. 
What is your opinion? 
  [Kohl] First of all, it was not difficult for me to explain 
why we are not intervening with German soldiers in the former 
Yugoslavia. It is not possible for us because we have not yet 
amended our constitution, which is urgently needed. One cannot 
be a member of the club of the United Nations and enjoy the 
rights but reject the obligations. Yet even once the 
constitution is amended, we are not the right partners because 
of our historical experiences during the 1940s in the war in 
Yugoslavia. We cannot send soldiers there, not even for 
humanitarian missions. I have always rejected that. By the 
way, I have not met anybody in the United States who does not 
understand these two arguments. 
  [Markwort] The chancellor of the largest -- and most 
important -- European nation has now stated that Europe is not 
doing enough for the protection of human rights. Who should do 
something? The smaller states? Who makes a decision in Europe? 
Every country is probably waiting for another. 
  [Kohl] To be honest, there is no simple solution to the 
problem that we are facing. Those who advocate the dispatch of 
soldiers -- I am addressing the German public here -- must be 
aware that someone has to issue the order. My Spanish 
counterpart and friend Felipe Gonzales had to mourn 27 deaths in 
a humanitarian mission. Thus, if a young Spanish soldier from 
Bilbao, for example, is shot dead, Felipe Gonzales must tell his 
mother, his father, his bride, or his wife why he sent the 
soldier there. Those who advocate military measures must be 
aware that several hundred thousand soldiers would be needed. I 
do not know anybody who would issue such an order. I would not 
recommend it to any of my counterparts or expect him to do so. 
This is the truth. What we have to try once more is to use the 
authority of the leaders and of the large countries to arrive at 
an acceptable compromise. We have achieved some progress 
concerning a new order. We have entered the final phase. We 
also discussed this in Washington. Yet I cannot offer a 
panacea. All who claim that we should drop bombs should not 
forget the pictures of civilian casualties with which we will be 
confronted afterward. We are facing an unholy alliance of the 
worst factors here. 
  [Mertes] You say unholy alliance. Of course, this is a 
conflict that goes on and on. Can it be that the economic 
problems that oppress us suddenly look very small in view of the 
foreign policy dangers that are emerging? 
  [Kohl] Yes. This is a development that has been under way 
for a long time and that has a lot to do with public opinion and 
changes in public opinion. Bismarck's sentence that foreign and 
security policy -- and nothing else -- decide the fate of a 
nation is a sentence that has been ridiculed by many in this 
country over the past years. We knew everything better, so to 
speak. Now we have again got into the thunderstorms of history. 
  However, compared with 1914, we have a completely different 
situation. Today there is an international community, today 
there is the community in Europe, which is even more important 
in this case, if you take, for instance, the Charter of the 
Council of Europe, which clearly condemns everybody who changes 
borders by force. If we had had that set down in international 
law in 1914, the world would have taken a different course. 
  [Mertes] Even then no one was fond of war. 
  [Kohl] Yes, but the forms were completely different at that 
time. This is what is happening in Yugoslavia just now and that 
is why I am categorically in favor of making it known to those 
who change borders by force there that, as soon as the civil war 
is over and borders changed by force remain in effect, this FRG 
-- at least with Chancellor Kohl -- will not pay a single mark 
for reconstruction. I think that we should have used this 
threat, if you like, much more in Europe. I have always said 
that. 
  Because there are many people in this region -- not only 
from 
one group, which one must say for the sake of fairness -- who 
think: Now we are doing this, we are shifting borders, we are 
terrorizing the people, we are carrying out ethnic cleansing, 
and then, in the end, they will give in for the sake of peace, 
and then everything will have been destroyed and gigantic 
billion sums --six-digit billion sums -- will be required. And 
then they will have to help us. 
  We do not have to do anything. I favor making it clear that 
those who work with the methods of international political 
gangsterism -- what we experienced during the first half of the 
century in the German name and to the detriment of the Germans 
-- cannot be subsidized and supported by us any more. 
  As regards Russia, we have to support the reform forces and 
make sure that those who see the dangers and know that their 
future is impossible without foreign aid and that foreign aid 
and also German aid depends on sticking to the principles that I 
have just mentioned, that reforms are slowly advanced, no matter 
how difficult they are.... [sentence as heard]. 
  [Mertes] You continue to believe in Yeltsin? 
  [Kohl] I am firmly confirmed that Boris Yeltsin first wants 
reforms -- not as some Harvard professor draws up in a model but 
under the current conditions in Russia. This will work far more 
slowly. 
  After all, how else should it work after 80 years of 
communism? You know, when I talk to Boris Yeltsin I feel in him 
and in many others that they are proud people, a proud nation, a 
proud country, with a great history and tradition, and they all 
see in the pictures how five, six, or seven years ago half the 
world made a pilgrimage there, some of them on their knees. I 
still remember the undignified pictures, for instance at 
Andropov's funeral. And now the same people who came crawling 
on their knees at that time to pay homage are now talking 
arrogantly. 
  I think it was one of Bill Clinton's best deeds of the past 
few weeks that, when he visited Moscow, he honored the Russians 
by making it clear: You are the other great country, nobody 
wants to patronize you, we want to help you, but it must be help 
for self-help. 
  [Mertes] In conclusion, let us come back again to domestic 
policy, to the gray domestic policy. 
  [Kohl] It is not gray at all. 
  [Mertes] Okay. But I do not know whether you want to deny 
that the cohesion of the CDU, your party, leaves a lot to be 
desired at the beginning of the election year. What do you want 
to do at the party congress in Hamburg at the end of February in 
order to improve cohesion? What will you call for? Will you 
also call for the chancellor's election campaign? What will be 
the issues? 
  [Kohl] The party must know that we can win the elections 
only if we are cohesive, and the party certainly knows that. 
Already the formulation is incorrect. It is not true that the 
party does not want to struggle, nor that the party is torn by 
strife. There are relatively few who do that. 
  [Mertes] Do you want to stop those at the party congress in 
Hamburg? 
  [Kohl] You ask what I am going to tell the people in 
Hamburg. I will say: People, this is the direction in which we 
are moving, and I support it. Whoever wants something else is 
welcome to get up on the rostrum here and say so. This is the 
hour of truth. 
  And I can predict what will happen then, but I am not going 
to tell you now. We will talk about that after the party 
congress. 
  [Markwort] Mertes mentioned the chancellor's election 
campaign. Do we have to assume that only Helmut Kohl will be 
seen on the billboards? Which of the CDU politicians would you 
like to present in addition? 
  [Kohl] No, not at all. We have never done that, with the 
exception of the 1990 elections, which were the elections of 
German unification, because we had the same posters and in 
Rostock it was rather clear who would be stressed. In all the 
election campaigns -- after all this is not the first election 
in which we are running -- we have always stressed the top man. 
  [Markwort] Who would you like to see on the posters apart 
from yourself? 
  [Kohl] The candidate is well known. We will certainly not 
stress an enormous number of people. However, we will stress 
some and they must be men and women and this must be discussed 
in the party bodies, because if I say it here, you will have a 
wonderful journalistic message, but the party will say: He has 
not asked us at all. 
  [Mertes] But actually these people should be known. 
  [Kohl] They are known indeed. I may assure you that they 
have already been sired, they have already been born, and they 
are already of age. 
  [Mertes] You have not only been born, but you will be 64 
this election year. This is a good age, but, of course, this 
will also be a year that enormously drains one's strength. Do 
you feel physically fit and healthy enough to go through this 
election campaign? 
  [Kohl] In everyday life I get the impression that a number 
of younger people moan at my physical fitness. This is not my 
achievement. I can only think God every day that this is the 
case. This year I really want to know it, and this year I really 
want to struggle for every single vote -- in the streets, in the 
squares, at many opportunities. And, above all, I want to 
struggle for a political conviction, for a direction of German 
politics, in which we understand history, act on the basis of 
history, but orient ourselves toward the future by not sticking 
to the status quo in all matters and say: This was so in the 
past and it must remain so, but in which we carefully examine 
what is solid -- and these things must remain. But a lot of 
things must change. 
  By the way, the elections will be won by those who believe 
that we have a realistic reason for optimism. 
  [Mertes] Thank you very much, Mr. Chancellor.

  [Text] -- Mr. Giscard d'Estaing asks for an "immediate air 
strike." In a communique released on Sunday 6 February, former 
President of the Republic Valery Giscard d'Estaing states the 
following: "We are horrified and revolted by the massacre on 
Sarajevo's marketplace. Any further talk is now futile. Now is 
the time for decisions to be made. Resolution 836 of the UN 
Security Council dated 4 June 1993 provides us with legal means 
of action. We now await the urgent implementation of these 
decisions, consisting in an air strike against the batteries of 
artillery which fired on Sarajevo's marketplace." 
  -- Mr. Longuet wants "reprisals." Republican Party 
President and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet on Sunday on RMC 
[radio station] expressed his hope that "the United Nations will 
authorize NATO forces to perform retaliatory strikes in order to 
end the massacre" in Bosnia. He added: "We cannot send troops, 
we cannot be present in the field and at the same time appear to 
condone ever-increasing displays of violence." 
  -- Mr. Kouchner, former humanitarian action minister, 
regretted on Sunday at the "maison de la chimie" [convention 
hall], where he was attending a convention on social change, 
that France "should believe the blame can be evenly apportioned 
among everyone, as if there was not one person who is hit by a 
bomb and another who throws it, as if there was not on the one 
hand people who are dying and on the other people who are 
killing them. This is biased diplomacy." 
  -- Socialist Party Leader Michel Rocard said on Sunday 6 
February on 20:00 news on TF1 [television network] that it was 
"now absolutely necessary for our countries to call on their 
governments to force a ceasefire" upon the belligerents, which 
requires "the support of air strikes." 
  -- The Communist Party leader Robert Hue announced on Sunday 
on France 2 [television network] during the "Heure de verite" 
["Hour of Truth"] that his party was calling for a "large rally" 
in Paris on 10 February at "place de l'Opera" to call for peace 
in Bosnia. He added that a negotiated settlement must be found 
as a military solution would be "disastrous."

<F P=106> [Eduardo Mascarenhas report: "Army Closer to NATO"] </F>
  [Text] The Defense Ministry is studying the possibility of 
incorporating the Portuguese mainland territory into one of the 
NATO areas. The Army advocates turning Cinciberlant [Commander 
in Chief, Iberian-Atlantic Area] into an integrated command, and 
has in mind assistance for infrastructures. The United States 
will be looking at Tancos. 
  Madeira and the Azores are the only Portuguese territories 
formally coming under both a national and a NATO military 
command. Their respective integrated commands answer to the 
Armed Forces chief of staff, who appoints them, and the 
Cinciberlant, who in turn comes under Saclant -- Supreme Allied 
Commander. 
  As far as the mainland territory is concerned, there has 
recently been a situation of dichotomy. The Iberlant command, 
which from the setting up of the alliance's military structure 
held responsibility only for the territory's maritime defense, 
has for several years had an Air Force "antenna," and forms the 
link with Saceur -- Supreme Allied Commander, Europe -- as far 
as air defense is concerned. Defense of the "ground" remains a 
wholly national responsibility, which is not the case for any 
other member of the allied military structure on this side of 
the Atlantic. 
  The alliance treaty says that an attack on any one of the 
member countries is an attack on all of them, but it also states 
that the defense of their respective territories is primarily a 
national responsibility. That is, it pledges assistance, but in 
terms of "reinforcement." All the European countries in the 
allied integrated military structure are covered by plans to 
that effect, and the forces assigned to each of them are known, 
except for Portugal. And for a simple reason: They do not 
exist, despite Portugal's having units assigned to the ground 
defense of its allies (the Separate Mixed Brigade and the 
Airborne Brigade). 
  Portugal, a founder of the alliance which has always been a 
member of its integrated military structure, thus finds itself 
in a situation almost comparable with that of France and Spain, 
which, not belonging to that structure, have introduced into it 
the idea of a "NATO a la carte." 
  The situation stems from the strategic stance adopted by 
Salazar (to be in it, without being in it...), which, in a 
scenario of a limited to the integrity of the mainland 
territory, had two other instruments: The Iberian Pact and the 
ZIC [expansion unknown] Agreement, which linked Madrid and 
Washington, was in force until Spain's entry into NATO and 
envisaged an operations area which covered Portugal. The 
situation is also partly a result of the Army's involvement in 
Africa from the beginning of the sixties. 
  Today, following the experience of taking part in meetings 
at 
the headquarters of Saclant (Norfolk), under which the Azores 
and Madeira come, and the increasing presence in NATO's command 
bodies in Europe, the Army has "woken up." It advocates the 
mainland territory's incorporation into a NATO command. It also 
advocates that Cinciberlant, which currently has air-sea 
characteristics, be turned into an integrated command in the 
"full" sense of the term. 
  NATO's new military structure has already been redesigned. 
NATO's Atlantic command experiences no changes; the Channel 
command, which used to cooperate with the European command with 
respect to air defense, disappears; and it is in the 
last-mentioned command (Allied Command Europe) that changes are 
noted, as well as an increase in Britain's responsibility in the 
northern areas. The center command (Commander in Chief, Allied 
Forces, Central Europe) acquires responsibility for air defense 
over the Baltic. This structure has already achieved consensus 
in NATO but is not yet official. In allied military circles, it 
is maintained that the Portuguese initiative, if it 
materializes, is unlikely to be taken into account now, owing to 
the delay with which it comes about. 
  In Portugal, the last word will rest with the government, 
and, in particular with the defense minister, under whose aegis 
studies are taking place. In advocating the mainland territory's 
incorporation into one of the NATO commands, the Army has in 
mind not so much the assigning of allied forces for its defense 
as securing financial assistance for infrastructures such as the 
bases of Sao Jacinto or Tancos, which it has just received from 
the Air Force and where it has installed the new Airborne 
Brigade. 
  "Why should the Italian command, under which the brigade 
comes for NATO purposes, benefit from all the assistance? Why 
does use of the brigade have to pass previously through Italy?" 
an Army general asked, talking to DIARIO DE NOTICIAS. In that 
officer's opinion, the mainland territory's incorporation would 
make it possible not only to secure funds to which the Army does 
not have access at present, but also for Portugal to be viewed 
in a different light in the alliance, owing to a "total 
presence." 
  However, according to a well-placed source, there are those 
at the Defense Ministry, whose minister has not yet made a 
pronouncement, who maintain that the initiative could help 
destabilize the traditional Portuguese geostrategic position in 
the transatlantic axis. It is asserted there that the solution 
to the Army's needs could be found in another way: The United 
States will certainly be looking at Tancos in the framework of 
its plans for the forward defense of its own interests.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar Hardens His Line Following 27 </F>
January"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar 
yesterday accused Felipe Gonzalez of "evading his 
responsibility, even after the general strike." He also warned 
him that he cannot "be constantly throwing life belts to a 
government intent on drowning; there are not enough life belts." 
  Aznar made these statements at the closing session of the 
Madrid New Generations regional congress, at which he pledged to 
continue with "the same line of responsibility," although he 
warned: "My responsibility is also to make it clear that I 
cannot be devoting myself every day to plugging the leaks of a 
government which is constantly springing them." 
  The conservative leader said that the government "cannot be 
criticized for what it does but rather for what it does not do," 
because since the elections it has done nothing. "I regret 
that, following the general strike, the government has no 
appraisal, is not appraising this, accepts no responsibility, 
and is saying nothing." 
  "Gonzalez has evaded his responsibility for too long, like 
[Deputy Prime Minister] Serra or the economy minister, who is as 
if he did not exist; I believe that he has taken a decision not 
to exist politically," Aznar said. 
  The People's Party chairman pointed out again Felipe 
Gonzalez' inability to reach a social pact, when he has always 
presented this as a prerequisite for beginning the country's 
economic recovery. 
<H5>  Disappointment </H5>
  In the People's Party chairman's opinion, "the government's 
inaction since the last general election is causing among the 
public a deep feeling of disappointment and dejection which 
makes pressing and necessary the change proposed by the People's 
Party, a view which more Spanish people are approaching each 
day." 
  In view of this situation, he asserted that the People's 
Party will continue with its policy of dialogue and consensus 
with all the economic agents, because the best solution for the 
country is a major agreement in order to pull through. "Let 
everybody forgo what he must forgo in Spain's interest -- both 
the employers' organization and trade unions," Aznar asked. 
  "Emerging from the crisis," he added, "requires everybody's 
efforts and all Spanish people's responsibility, but never from 
a partisan viewpoint but by regarding this as the major national 
task remaining to be performed by us." 
  In the People's Party chairman's opinion, "it is absurd, and 
from the viewpoint of our international image, grotesque, that 
those who voted for Felipe Gonzalez in June should be staging a 
general strike six months later." 
  He warned that the People's Party will continue with its 
responsible policy, because the solution is not to play more or 
less rough but to offer a path of hope to the majority of 
Spanish people, who are very disappointed. "I prefer to give 
the Spanish people hope, rather than a dissatisfying, merely 
critical exercise," he said. 
  He also had a message for the Catalan and Basque 
nationalists, whom he told that "there is no territorial 
interest which deserves to be defended at the cost of Spain's 
general interest." 
  Aznar wound up his speech at the closing session of the 
Madrid New Generations congress by warning that the day of 
political change is near, but he pointed out that that day will 
not be a mere change of ruling party but a national task of 
Spain's recovery which transcends the People's Party and 
requires not a party but a national effort. 
<H5>  People's Party Blueprint </H5>
  He reiterated that the People's Party blueprint is the only 
solution "for the economic, social, and ethical transformation 
of Spanish society." Last, he exhorted young people to take 
part increasingly actively in that task of change, because "in 
the rising generation lies the driving force to promote a new 
outlook in the country's leaders and citizens." 
  The meeting was also attended by Mayor of Madrid Jose Maria 
Alvarez del Manzano, who called on the People's Party youth in 
this autonomous community to work diligently and demandingly and 
to do everything possible to ensure that the People's Party 
leader becomes prime minister, "because he deserves it."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said the 
government is not prepared to discuss any changes to the 
provisions in the confidence-building measures [CBM's] for the 
return of the entire fenced-off area of Famagusta. Speaking 
after a meeting with the Famagusta mayor and municipal 
counselors, Mikhailidhis said the government is not discussing 
the contents of the measures package, but its implementation. 
He added: These measures very clearly refer to Famagusta's 
fenced-off area. 
  Asked about the safety of Famagusta's residents, 
Mikhailidhis 
said this is one issue that will be discussed. He said: We 
want enough security so that whoever returns to Famagusta will 
feel that they are returning to their homes permanently. 
Mikhailidhis said the implementation of the CBM's would allow 
15,000-16,000 residents to return to Famagusta. 
  Famagusta Mayor Andreas Pouyiouros said the citizens of 
Famagusta number 60,000, adding that the Municipal Council's 
position is that the whole town should be returned in accordance 
with UN Security Council Resolution 550. Pouyiouros described a 
UN experts' report on the implementation of the CBM's as 
unacceptable and intolerable, adding that the world's powers and 
the United Nations see the measures as the first step toward an 
overall Cyprus solution.

issued a statement today calling on the government to use its 
veto at the NATO conference, even at the last moment, as it 
says, to prevent any decision to undertake military operations 
in the area of Bosnia. The KKE Political Bureau also demands 
the immediate convening of the Chamber of Deputies to debate the 
situation. 
  KKE's assessment is that military intervention has been in 
preparation for a long time and it holds the government 
responsible for putting its signature on the latest decision by 
the European Union's foreign ministers, which it describes as 
criminal.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The West's new hard-nosed approach towards Bosnia 
appeared tonight to have forced a remarkable peace settlement in 
the besieged capital Sarajevo. Serb and Muslim military 
commanders agreed to a ceasefire and the Bosnian Serb army 
pledged to withdraw its artillery guns from around the city. 
  However, NATO members remained cynical about the 
effectiveness of the ceasefire given the notoriously short time 
previous deals have lasted. 
  The agreement came as NATO threatened air strikes if the 
Serbs did not withdraw from Sarajevo. Following a meeting of 
NATO ambassadors in Brussels, the alliance agreed to threaten 
air strikes unless the Serbs withdraw heavy weapons from around 
Sarajevo within a maximum of 10 days. 
  Tonight, the ambassadors were still discussing whether to 
describe the threat publicly as an ultimatum, said one alliance 
source, adding: "But there is now agreement in principle that a 
deadline will be set, beyond which air strikes will be used. 
The rest of the discussion concerns details, not the principle." 
  The agreement came only a couple of weeks after the arrival 
of Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose as the new UN commander 
in Bosnia. With the unqualified backing of the Government for 
tough action, the former SAS [Special Air Service] chief has had 
a dramatic effect on Serb intransigence. An impressive figure 
with piercing, cold blue eyes and an equally impressive military 
record, he has warned the leaders of the warring factions that 
he will no longer tolerate interference in UN operations. But 
above all, he has convinced them he is not bluffing and that he 
is not a man to be messed with. 
  It was clear tonight that Sir Michael's tough new stance 
together with the West's determination to use the savage 
marketplace massacre in which 68 civilians died at the weekend 
to force a peace accord in Sarajevo had placed the Serbs on the 
back foot. 
  The talks in Sarajevo were attended by Muslim army Gen Jovan 
Divjak and Bosnian Serb Gen Manojlo Milovanovic. Sir Michael 
reportedly shuttled back and forth between the Muslim and Serb 
representatives in separate rooms at Sarajevo airport. 
  It is proposed that UN soldiers will take over sensitive 
positions in and around Sarajevo, he said. 
  In Brussels, the NATO meeting opened with a general debate 
about delivering an ultimatum to the Serbs, giving them a 
timetable for withdrawing from Sarajevo or face air strikes. 
The most reluctant participants in such a threat remain the 
Canadians, Spanish, Greeks and the British, although Mr Major 
has made it clear the Government is ready to support a 
"muscular" response. He is willing to endorse an ultimatum, 
with the threat of air strikes to follow, "provided the 
commanders judge it appropriate." But Britain's NATO ambassador 
John Weston was at pains to emphasise that Britain remains 
convinced a negotiated settlement of the war in the former 
Yugoslavia is the only long-term solution. 
  The political implications of any NATO action are still 
being 
analysed -- but today's talks indicate overwhelming agreement 
that last Saturday's [5 February] market massacre marked what 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called "a turning point" in the 
22-month war. 
  President Clinton called Mr Major and had a 30-minute phone 
conversation this afternoon to discuss the Bosnia situation in 
detail, Downing Street said. It was learned later that Mr 
Clinton tried to telephone the Prime Minister last night. But 
Mr Major was aloft in a helicopter at the time and the call was 
rescheduled for this afternoon. 
  Downing Street said of the call later: "This was a very good 
and productive conversation. The Prime Minister and President 
agreed that what was needed was a clear decision from NATO for 
the use of air power to support UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force] 
efforts to stop the bombardment of civilians in Sarajevo. The 
President acknowledged that the safety of British and other 
UNPROFOR troops on the ground was a very important 
consideration." 
  Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, commenting on 
today's developments, said: "This shows that a tough attitude 
towards the Serbs would have yielded dividends before. It is 
vital that the pressure is kept up on the Serbs and that the 
United Nations maintains its initiative. The right next step 
would be to open Tuzla Airport."

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today refused to 
rule out sending more British troops to Bosnia if there was 
retaliation for United Nations air strikes. He also insisted 
there had been no change in Government policy over Bosnia. He 
ridiculed the idea that he and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
had been overruled by the Prime Minister in agreeing to the 
ultimatum on air strikes to protect Sarajevo. 
  Mr Rifkind was speaking after the NATO allies served a 
10-day 
notice on the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo that air strikes 
would be launched on behalf of the UN unless they withdrew. The 
ultimatum, following 12 hours of talks in Brussels, paved the 
way for the first military action in NATO's history. 
  It was reinfoced by President Clinton who said: "NATO is now 
set to act. Anyone, anyone, shelling Sarajevo must recognise 
this fact and be prepared to deal with the consequences. 
  "No one should doubt NATO's resolve," he told a White House 
briefing. 
  Sarajevo was quiet overnight, apart from isolated bursts of 
small arms and machinegun fire. A ceasefire in the city, 
negotiated by the British commander of United Nations 
peacekeeping forces, Lt Gen Sir Michael Rose, was due to take 
effect by noon (1100 GMT). 
  The NATO ultimatum, after tortuous negotiations and detailed 
consideration of all military and political implications for the 
West, requires a withdrawal out of the Bosnian capital of all 
heavy artillery by at least 13 miles, or the handing-over of 
weaponry to UN forces. It also threatens air strikes immediately 
if any shelling resumes in the wake of last weekend's street 
market massacre which killed 68 civilians. One effect of the 
ultimatum in Sarajevo was a promise by the Bosnian Serb army 
last night to withdraw its big guns from around the city. 
  Mr Rifkind stressed that the UN had not taken sides against 
the Serbs and that the ultimatum to stop firing around Sarajevo 
applied to the Bosnian government forces as well. He said 
Britain and France already provided most of the UN forces in 
Bosnia. But he added: "There is clearly a possibility that the 
UN may require some extra forces in order to monitor the 
ceasfire between the Muslims and the Serbs in Sarajevo. 
  "We obviously would want to see what other countries are 
doing, who was pulling their weight and who wasn't. That would 
have to be the basis of any future position." 
  He admitted the situation in Bosnia was now dangerous for 
British forces, but added: "It has been dangerous throughout." 
He said: "The objective is to make the Serbs carry out their 
promise and if they carry out their promise there will not be 
any air strikes," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He 
denied British Government policy over Bosnia had changed, after 
initial emphasis on supplying humanitarian aid and not getting 
involved in a civil war. "What we have accepted right from the 
very beginning is that there are ways in which the use of 
military force can reduce suffering in Bosnia." 
  The soldiers had prevented atrocities just by their 
presence, 
he said. "What we agreed yesterday was an extension of that 
because what we are anxious to do is to end the kind of atrocity 
we saw in Sarajevo last weekend." 
  Britain's Ambassador to NATO, John Weston, endorsed the move 
on the Government's behalf after assurances that the decision 
will not endanger three key goals: 

  -  The continuation of 
humanitarian aid supplies to the besieged citizens of 
Sarajevo. 
  -  The maintenance of the peace process. 
  -  The containment 
of the 22-month conflict within the borders of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Lord Owen, peace negotiator on behalf of the European Union, 
said today: "The Bosnian Serbs told us before the artillery 
shell dropped in the market place so tragically on Saturday, 
that they were ready for what is called a `Sarajevo first' 
policy of UN administration and demilitarisation. 
  "So I think there is a fairly good chance this agreement 
will 
now stick." 
  The three warring factions in Bosnia -- Serbs, Muslims and 
Croats -- will be holding more talks on Geneva today to try to 
find a negotiated peace.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government welcomes the 
NATO decision to impose an ultimatum on the attackers in 
Sarajevo, giving them 10 days to withdraw their heavy weapons 
outside a radius of 20 km around Sarajevo. Otherwise, NATO is 
threatening to destroy Serb positions with air strikes. Federal 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told the press in Bonn today that 
everything must be done to end any further bloodshed: "There has 
to be an end to the siege of Sarajevo." 
  Kinkel spoke of "decisions with very far-reaching 
implications." However, a political solution still has priority 
over a military one, he said. NATO hopes that there will be no 
need to implement the decision it has made. A peaceful solution 
cannot, however, be achieved against the wishes of the three 
warring parties -- the Moslems, Serbs, and Croats. He therefore 
appealed urgently to the three warring parties to do their 
utmost for a peaceful solution.

  [Excerpts] Paris, Feb 10 (AFP) -- France late Wednesday [9 
February] hailed the NATO decision to issue Bosnian Serbs with a 
10-day deadline to withdraw their heavy weapons from around 
Sarajevo, saying it was based on its own proposals for action 
following the marketplace slaughter. 
  A statement issued by the French foreign ministry called on 
the three warring sides -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- "to pull 
back to avoid an escalation" of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "France welcomes the firm and clear decision taken by the 
Atlantic alliance which was made necessary it following the 
drama in Sarajevo. 
  "As it (France) proposed, the decision makes demands, fixes 
a 
deadline and sets out sanctions," the statement said. [passage 
omitted] 
  "France, which is the main contributor of (UN) troops in 
former Yugoslavia and notably in Sarajevo, notes the gravity of 
decisions taken. It also wants the Bosnian government to trust 
that a peace settlement will be put into action." 
  The ministry also welcomed the willingness shown by the 
United States to work with Europe in trying to resolve the 
conflict. 
  The statement added: "This start by the international 
community has to be followed through. It must now prove that it 
has the same determination to put into effect the decisions it 
adopted today (Wednesday). 
  "France and its European and American partners have to 
redouble their efforts in liaison with Russia in order to 
rapidly bring about a peace agreement based on the European 
Union's plan of action. 
  "France calls on all parties to pull back within the time 
limit fixed by NATO to avoid any escalation and to act 
responsibly in the search for a negotiated peace settlement."

  [Text] "It is a first, significant step forward in sorting 
out the affair." This is how Foreign Minister Andreatta 
commented on the Bosnia ultimatum decided by the NATO Council. 
  Andreatta, who is attending the Geneva conference of 
countries bordering the former Yugoslavia, added: "There are 
still some unanswered questions." He cited problems concerning 
the international administration of Sarajevo, disarmament, and 
the coexistence of different ethnic groups in single districts 
of Sarajevo.

  [Text] The Prime Minister takes the view that NATO must be

Silva believes that NATO should proceed calmly so as to spare 
the civilian populations' greater suffering: 
  [Begin Silva recording] There is a debate going on in NATO 
even as we speak, and -- Portugal's being merely one voice among 
many -- I cannot anticipate the outcome. However, Portugal will 
not oppose air strikes if those countries which in particular 
have troops on the ground -- Britain, France, Spain, Canada, and 
others -- believe that such strikes are the adequate means to 
bring to an end, or mitigate, the slaughter that is taking place 
on the ground. 
  But I repeat, the goal is the provision of humanitarian aid 
to the population and ending the war that has hit that part of 
Europe. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] NATO members are all agreed: More 
pressure on Bosnian Serbs is needed. [passage omitted] 
  Today, NATO ambassadors are discussing how long the Serbs 
should be given to lift the siege of Sarajevo. [passage 
omitted]. 
  We have Foreign Minister Durao Barroso on the line from 
Brazil. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Can you comment on this 
situation? What attitude will Portugal take as a member of NATO? 
  [Barroso] We agree that it is time to act. At the same time, 
we seek to do it with clear and well-defined objectives. We 
think that it is important to stress that the situation we seek 
is not exactly a military one, but, quite the contrary, we seek 
to exercise military pressure to achieve a negotiated solution. 
Portugal's objective, the same as that of the European Union 
[EU] and we can say of all the international community, 
continues to be peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina and not a 
declaration of war against any of the sides. 
  [Correspondent] Do you share the view that it is necessary 
to 
give the Bosnian Serbs an ultimatum now? 
  [Barroso] The expression ultimatum is perhaps not the most 
appropriate. And perhaps the Bosnian Serbs should not be 
singled out. In our opinion -- and it is not only our opinion, 
everyone is responsible in that situation -- the blame does not 
fall on one side only. What could be done, and what we would 
like to see happen, is that a deadline should be set, a date 
beyond which no heavy artillery can be found in a certain 
region. No matter who it belongs to. 
  [Correspondent] How long before the deadline? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Barroso] That is a technical, a military matter. I cannot 
define it here. It is up to NATO to decide after hearing views, 
above all those of the military, the views of the NATO Military 
Committee. These are issues concerning military tactics, and it 
is not up to us. It is up to us to define the political line, 
and this is the political line: we are going to use, if 
necessary, air strikes to bring about an accord, but we are not 
going to here, publicly, define deadlines or targets, obviously. 
  [Correspondent] As you know, we are talking about deadlines 
because that is one of the differences between NATO members. 
But what you are telling me, really, is that as soon as it is 
possible to remove all weapons, that is what is desired, that is 
what you would like. 
  [Barroso] The idea we supported at the EU ministers' meeting 
is that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted. That is, to make it 
possible to enter and leave Sarajevo freely, to distribute 
humanitarian aid, and to put an end to this horrible situation 
that the city is experiencing where the civilian population is a 
target for snipers who surround Sarajevo. This is the 
objective. As for the deadlines, I repeat, it is a matter to be 
decided, above all after hearing the military experts. It is 
not up to us on a political and diplomatic level to decide. At 
least in my opinion, that discussion like that should not be 
carried out publicly. 
  [Correspondent] If there is a military intervention, if 
there 
is the need for a military intervention, will Portugal 
participate with its air force? 
  [Barroso] In principle, that is not on the cards. 
  [Announcer] That was Minister Durao Barroso speaking to us 
from Brazil. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana by </F>
correspondent Ramon Pellicer; Solana at Congress of Deputies in 
Madrid, Pellicer in studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Pellicer] Mr. Solana, good evening. 
  [Solana] Hello. Good evening. How are you? 
  [Pellicer] We have just heard a moment ago that the use of 
the word ultimatum is one of the reasons that the meeting of 
NATO ambassadors went on all day. Does Spain agree to using 
this term to threaten the Serb militia? 
  [Solana] The fact that the meeting was prolonged is not 
directly related to that term. It has to do with some of the 
technical aspects that took longer than expected. However, I 
can tell you that there is a basic consensus about the general 
idea of how to answer the letter sent by the UN secretary 
general to NATO requesting help in solving the Sarajevo problem. 
This basic consensus will become apparent in the next few hours. 
  [Pellicer] But will Spain agree to use the term ultimatum if 
need be? 
  [Solana] Spain agrees to the resolution that is being 
debated 
right now. It will incorporate a delay of approximately seven 
to 10 days so that the heavy weapons that are now threatening 
Sarajevo can be withdrawn to an approximate 20 or 30 kilometer 
perimeter from the city. These are the topics that are now 
being debated. These are technical topics as I said, topics in 
which the military command has to give its opinion since it has 
to decide whether 20 or whether 30 kilometers are enough to 
solve the problem we want solved. The problem we want solved is 
the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo. Sarajevo is today a 
divided city, but a city divided physically as well as morally, 
spiritually. We have to be able to overcome this physical and 
moral division that now exists in Sarajevo. We will do whatever 
is in our means to help. At the same time we have to give the 
necessary protection to our Armed Forces deployed in the field. 
I can also tell you -- and through you tell the Spanish citizens 
now listening to us -- that the government and the armed forces 
-- their command -- as well as the UN military command, are 
doing all they can to protect our blue helmets in the field. 
  [Pellicer] Is there an agreed protection plan in case the 
Serbs attack? 
  [Solana] Logically, all the measures have been taken. The 
necessary alerts have been made too. The defense minister 
[Julian Garcia Vargas] said it clearly yesterday and I do not 
have to repeat what he said. 
  [Pellicer] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana, thank you 
for answering our questions. 
  [Solana] Thank you.

  [Text] A few minutes ago, as soon as NATO's demand that 
Bosnian Serbs lift the siege of Sarajevo was made public, 
Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said in a statement to 
Radio Nacional that contrary to what one might think, warning of 
air strikes is a move toward peace. 
  [Begin Solana recording] It is a decision that is, or 
should, 
be understood in the context of a peace process. The logic that 
all of us are still backing is the logic of peace, not the logic 
of war. Unfortunately, what is happening is that sometimes one 
has to threaten with a specific military action, with a concrete 
one, one that has a specific timeframe and in a specific area to 
reach one's aim, peace, so that it happens more rapidly. [end

  [Text] Asked what Greece would do if the permanent NATO 
members today decided to use force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: We will not 
allow the NATO base in Aktion to be used, we will withdraw the 
Greek crew members from the AWACS [Airborne Warning And Control 
System], and demand that no Balkan country participates in 
military operations in the former Yugoslavia. Venizelos 
stressed that this is the unanimous view of all political party 
leaders; it was expressed at a meeting under President 
Konstandinos Karamanlis on 10 May 1993. 
  Venizelos added: These positions are firm and our permanent 
representative Ambassador Zafiropoulos will convey them to NATO. 
We hope that a diplomatic solution to end this bloody war will 
be found, that is, an immediate and viable solution. 
  Answering another question, Venizelos said Greece is not 
willing to veto a decision on military operations because, as he 
explained, the international common view would see Greece as 
part of the Yugoslav crisis. The spokesman concluded: On the 
contrary, the international community should realize that our 
country is a factor of stability in the Balkans.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] According to reliable NATO 
sources, Greece and Canada were expressing opposition to air 
raids until the last minute. The decision was unanimous, but 
the Greek permanent representative, Ambassador Vasilios 
Zafiropoulos, submitted the following statement to the Council's 
minutes: 
  The Greek presidency stresses that in view of the latest 
developments--the decision of the Serbs and Muslims to withdraw 
their heavy weapons--and based on information supplied by 
international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg on 
Sarajevo's demilitarization, it believes that pursuing the same 
goal through violent methods is not only illogical but also 
unavoidably creates the danger of a negative outcome. 
Therefore, in addition to expressing general reservations about 
the purpose of air raids, the Greek Presidency separates 
[dhiakhorizi] its position.

  [Text] Ankara, Feb 9 (A.A) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Wednesday [9 February] said that if the decision taken 
by the NATO permanent representatives meeting is encouraging for 
the aggressor in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Turkey will not accept it. 
  Ambassadors from the 16 North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
(NATO) states are meeting in Brussels to discuss measures 
against Serbs, following their mortar attack in Sarajevo last 
week. 
  Speaking to reporters, Cetin said a plan drawn by the United 
States and France is well below Turkey's expectations adding it 
has repeatedly called for a "direct air operation without any 
waiting period." 
  Under the proposal, Serb artillery would have to be pulled 
back at least 20 km (12 miles) from Sarajevo and all heavy 
weapons belonging to Serbs and Muslims in the area would then 
have to be handed over to the United Nations. 
  The United States and France have proposed a deadline of 
between seven and 10 days for besieging Serb forces to withdraw. 
  Failure to comply would mean NATO air strikes. 
  Cetin said if a resolution is taken without the backing of a 
power to enforce it, it has no meaning, and stressed that 
sanctioning measures must absolutely be applied if the 
resolution is not followed. 
  He added that further delays should be prevented, 
underlining 
the fact that if these sanctions are not applied, further 
violence will start. 
  Sixty eight helpless civilians were massacred and 200 
wounded 
when Serbian mortar turned a market place in central Sarajevo 
into a pool of blood.

Spokesman Ferhat Ataman] 
  [Text] It was reported that Turkey expects the NATO 
Council in Brussels to take concrete and decisive measures as 
soon as possible regarding the Bosnia issue. 
  In answer to a question at his weekly news conference, 
Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Ferhat Ataman pointed out that 
it is obvious there is a general and strong will toward speedily 
implementing violence-preventing measures. Explaining that new 
plans for an air operation are not needed since NATO already has 
access to plans for an air operation, Ataman said they will 
reply favorably in case NATO headquarters have a request from 
Turkey.

  [Text] Tugay Ozceri, Turkey's permanent representative to 
NATO, has said that the NATO Council decision on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is clear and that there is no need for a new 
UN Security Council resolution to undertake an air raid against 
the aggressors. 
  In a statement to ANATOLIA Agency at the conclusion of the 
NATO Council meeting, Ozceri assessed the developments saying 
that the removal of heavy weapons from a radius of 20 kilometers 
within 10 days has been envisaged. He noted that the deadline 
is 20 February and that the heavy weapons will either be pulled 
back from the region or handed over to the UN peacekeeping 
forces. Ozceri noted that the heavy weapons belonging to the 
Bosnian Muslims will remain in the region under UN 
responsibility. He added that a very close relationship has 
been formed; a decisionmaking mechanism has set up between the 
commander of the NATO southern Europe allied forces in Naples 
and the commander of the UN peacekeeping forces within the 
framework of the principles and methods developed at the 
military committee since August in a bid to speedily activate 
the air strike system in the event the aggressor does not comply 
with the ultimatum. He stated that no one doubts the system 
will function very well, adding, however, that the command 
should come from the United Nations. 
  Ozceri said that the UN secretary general will have to 
authorize the first raid, and the subsequent orders will come 
from his representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Expressing the 
wish that the NATO decision will have an effect on Serbia and 
Bosnian Serbs, Ozceri said: This is a satisfactory decision 
from Turkey's viewpoint. Turkey had been predicting every stage 
since August 1992 and had, therefore, put forward an action 
plan. Unfortunately, our warnings were not heeded. At this 
point we have passed through all the stages predicted by Turkey 
and we have reached that point which we envisaged to be the last. 
  Ozceri noted that the decision is beneficial from the 
viewpoint of preserving NATO's credibility as well.

  [Text] Speaking in Madrid on RNE-1's breakfast program, 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko said that a NATO air 
strike on Serb positions in Sarajevo might worsen the conflict 
and entail serious consequences: 
  [Begin Zlenko recording, in Spanish] I believe that aerial 
bombings or air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina could cause more 
victims among the civilian population. And they could also 
cause, or bring about, more victims among the blue helmets. [end 
recording] 
  The Ukrainian foreign minister, who has negotiated a 
bilateral cooperation agreement with Javier Solana, his Spanish 
opposite number, also referred to the agreement on dismantling 
Ukraine's nuclear weapons and spoke of the need for external 
financial cooperation in the task of dismantling long-range 
ballistic missiles. 
  Regarding the risk of Crimea's secession, the Ukrainian 
foreign minister reiterated that the Crimean peninsula is an 
integral part of his country.

  [Text] Copenhagen, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Danish Foreign Minister 
Niels Helveg Petersen said Wednesday [9 February] the European 
Community "still envisages introducing sanctions against 
Croatia" because of its involvement in the Bosnian conflict. 
  Petersen told a press conference he had raised the question 
of sanctions against the Croats at a meeting in Brussels Monday 
of European Community foreign ministers, but added that the 
matter had been sidelined by the massacre in Sarajevo and 
discussions on airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs. 
  "The member states agree that the question of sanctions will 
be discussed soon," he said. "What we are looking at is either 
trade sanctions or, alternatively, the possibility of 
withdrawing the preferential status Croatia enjoys in its trade 
with the Community."

  [Text] Pakistan has again urged India to hold plebiscite 
in occupied Kashmir and to allow the Kashmiri people to decide 
their future by themselves. Addressing the Human Rights 
Commission meeting in Geneva, the leader of the Pakistan 
delegation, Mr. Iqbal Akhund, said the only possible solution to 
the Kashmir dispute is the one which is acceptable to the people 
of Kashmir. He said that it will bring peace to the people of 
the subcontinent and strengthen the forces of democracy and 
progress in Pakistan and India. The Pakistan delegate said that 
over the last 45 years, India has maintained its occupation of 
occupied Kashmir, but has been unable to win the support of the 
Kashmiri people. At present, there are 600,000 Indian troops in 
occupied Kashmir engaged in suppressing the popular uprising 
against Indian occupation.

  [Text] India has called upon the European Union to provide 
better market access and enhance economic cooperation. During 
his meeting with the European Union troika foreign ministers in 
Brussels, the external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, 
explained the new opportunities for long-term partnership with 
India following economic liberalization. 
  Informing New Delhi's view on the expansion of the UN 
Security Council, Mr. Dinesh Singh said the aspirations of 
developing countries should be taken into consideration. He 
briefed them about India's efforts to strengthen secular 
democracy and steps taken by it to enforce human rights. 
  The minister also informed the EC ministers of New Delhi's 
offer to Pakistan of a comprehensive dialogue and its proposals 
to resolve all outstanding issues. Mr Dinesh Singh hoped that 
EC will ask Pakistan to desist from aiding terrorist activity in 
Kashmir. Referring to New Delhi's commitment to revive the 
democratic process in Kashmir, the external affairs minister 
said Pakistan's attempt to misuse human rights issue for 
political ends should be discouraged. He noted that Pakistan's 
own human rights record is poor. 
  The European Union welcomed India's economic reforms and the 
setting up of Human Rights Commission. The foreign ministers 
said that India can play a major role in world trade and 
stressed the need for strengthening mutual cooperation. 
  The European Union troika includes foreign ministers of 
Greece, Belgium and Germany. The meeting assumes significance 
as it was the first since the Maastricht Treaty came into force 
and after India signed an agreement for partnership and 
development with the union.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/PESC/94/10: "Declaration by the </F>
European Union on Sarajevo"] 
  [Text] The European Union expresses its revulsion at the 
renewed brutal shelling of civilians in Sarajevo which has taken 
place in recent days. 
  Bearing in mind the relevant resolutions of the UN, the 
decisions of the North Atlantic Alliance most recently 
reiterated at the NATO summit of 11 January, and the recent 
request of the UN Secretary-General, it supports a very early 
meeting of the North Atlantic Council. In concert with the UN 
Secretary-General, the aim should be to bring about the 
immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, using all the means 
necessary including the use of air power. 
  The measures taken would be the first step in the 
implementation of the action plan of the European Union. The 
European Union reiterates its support for the efforts of the 
co-chairmen to place the administration of Sarajevo under the 
authority of the UN.

Severely Criticizes `Inability' of Twelve in Bosnia"; as 
released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 8 Feb (Belga) -- Leo Tindemans, 
president of the European Parliament's Christian Democrat group, 
on Tuesday [8 February] severely criticized the inability of the 
"Twelve" of the European Union (EU) to take a joint stance in 
the light of the tragic unfolding of events in Bosnia. 
  Reacting in Strasbourg to the conclusions of the Council of 
Foreign Ministers, which on Monday in Brussels had asked for the 
"immediate lifting" of the siege of Sarajevo but did not issue 
an ultimatum and left the decision to NATO, Mr. Tindemans 
stressed that the Europeans remained divided. 
  "This inability strips the Maastricht Treaty of its 
credibility: the treaty precisely provides for the application 
of a joint foreign and security policy, starting this year," 
underlined the former Belgian prime minister. He went on to 
qualify the stance taken by the "Twelve" as "an example of cheap 
phraseology." 
  Mr. Tindemans observed that the EU member states were 
sheltering behind NATO. "That organization is at least 
credible," he said, "but the same cannot be said of Community 
policy." 
  The leader of the Christian Democrat group has for a long 
time been saying that other measures ought to have been taken to 
end the carnage in the former Yugoslavia. "If no measures are 
implemented, then we should lift the arms embargo on Bosnian 
Muslims," he said.

<F P=106> [Article signed CET: "European Union Calls For the Lifting </F>
of the Siege of Sarajevo, But Sets No Ultimatum"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 7 Feb (BELGA) -- Lifting the siege on 
Sarajevo would be the first step toward a political solution, as 
the European Union (EU) has suggested, added Belgian Foreign 
Minister Claes. 
  It is important in that connection that the United States 
and 
Russia become more involved in the peace negotiations. 
Washington seems ready to play a more prominent role in this 
connection, said Claes. He did not wish to make any statement 
about Moscow's attitude. 
  Claes said he was aware of the risk posed by military 
action, 
also with respect to the UN troops on the ground. We need 
military advice to keep the risk to a minimum. However, there 
comes a point in time when one can no longer remain an onlooker, 
but must take action, said Claes. Supposedly, even Butrus-Ghali 
considers that the situation has now gone "too far," otherwise 
he would not have requested NATO to send in the air force. 
  According to Claes, it is virtually definite that the 
murderous attack on Saturday [5 February] was the work of the 
Serbs. There is little doubt about that, but we are not 
absolutely certain, said the minister. However, this lack of 
absolute certainty does nothing to alter the attitude of the EU. 
It must be clear to everyone that this kind of atrocity is 
inadmissible. 
  From the statements made by Claes it was clear that European 
negotiator Lord David Owen was not in favor of imposing an 
ultimatum on the Serbs. 
  At a separate press conference, Lord Owen said that the 
Serbs 
would never agree to withdraw from Sarajevo if there was a 
chance that the Muslims would seize the opportunity to reconquer 
the liberated territory. Consequently, the Muslims of Sarajevo 
would also have to hand in their weapons, said Lord Owen. 
  Lord Owen also tabled the idea that the EU should pay the 
Serbs for withdrawing their troops, for example by easing the 
economic sanctions against Serbia. I was certainly not the only 
person to reject that idea categorically, said Minister Claes. 
  The fact that some member states of the EU stil have doubts 
about imposing an ultimatum on Serbia is not doing the image of 
the EU any good, said Minister Claes. It is now up to NATO to 
show its teeth. A harder attitude would not have done the EU any 
harm at all, said Minister Claes.

<F P=106> [Article signed EHK (JBP): "Leo Delcroix Has Reservations </F>
Regarding Air Strikes in Bosnia"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 7 Feb (BELGA) -- Belgian Defense Minister 
Leo Delcroix has certain reservations concerning the suggestion 
to carry out air strikes against Serbian positions. Belgium has 
considerable numbers of blue helmets in Bosnia and Baranja, 
which is why he remains very aware of what may follow, he 
explained in substance to a journalist from the BELGA agency who 
contacted him on Monday [7 February] during the minister's 
working visit, accompanied by a parliamentary delegation, to 
Belgian soldiers in Germany. The minister also believes it is 
impossible to continue as we are: Something must change, 
perhaps a more energetic intervention in order to once again 
give the mission a perspective. 
  "I hope that the European Union and NATO will arrive at a 
common point of view with respect to the three parties to the 
conflict, possibly concerning a large area around Sarajevo or 
perhaps more energetic intervention." 
  Mr. Delcroix believes that something must be done but doubts 
whether air strikes will provide a solution, even if he does 
understand the statements made on this subject by his colleague, 
Willy Claes. Mr. Delcroix is considering certain questions. Is 
it not possible that such bombings could lead to renewed 
nationalism, also in other countries? Would air strikes in an 
area around Sarajevo actually provide protection? Would it 
subsequently be possible to provide humanitarian aid? 
  Mr. Delcroix expressed the hope that the European Union and 
NATO will adopt a common position. In the meantime, 
consultations are continuing to see what measures should be 
taken. The defense minister did not, however, want to say what 
this might mean in practice. Does it mean a strengthening of 
the arms available to the blue helmets? "Allow me not to be too 
expansive concerning concrete possibilities," he replied.

  [Text] Bonn -- As a result of the massacre in Sarajevo, 
the Chancellor's Office is advocating a clearly tougher position 
but not necessarily air strikes. Shortly before the meeting of 
the NATO Council in Brussels today, senior officials hoped for 
the full implementation of UN Resolution 836, which asked NATO 
to establish protection zones. According to the officials, this 
also includes protection of convoys transporting humanitarian 
aid, which has not been guaranteed so far. 
  Officials believe this would also mean clearing the path for 
the convoys by forcibly removing blockades. Combat helicopters 
might be used for this purpose ("close air support"). Unlike 
air strikes, these measures would be covered by the existing 
mandate and would not require a new Security Council resolution, 
which would be difficult to achieve at the moment in view of the 
negative attitude of Russia and other permanent members. 
  According to the Chancellor's Office, the full utilization 
of 
the existing mandate would improve the credibility of the West, 
and a higher deterrence effect would be achieved. Public 
demands for large-scale air strikes, recently voiced on 
television by Bernd Schmidbauer, the minister in the 
Chancellor's Office, who is responsible for the intelligence 
services, have met with great reservations. Schmidbauer's view 
is not shared by others at the Chancellor's Office, it has 
become known.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton held an extensive telephone conversation 
last night to discuss the two countries' policy in Bosnia. As 
government spokesman Dieter Vogel reported in Bonn, Kohl 
emphatically supported the U.S. position, which is largely 
identical with French ideas. After the NATO decision Clinton 
warned the Bosnian Serbs and others against continuing to shell 
Bosnia's capital. Everyone who violates the decision, which is 
also largely based on U.S. proposals, "must be prepared for the 
consequences," Clinton said. The conflict itself "must be 
solved by the parties involved at the negotiating table," 
whereby the United States will take over a more substantial role. 
  According to Minister of the Chancellery Friedrich Bohl, the 
FRG has a "decisive share in the implementation of the ultimatum 
to Bosnia." On the ARD "Morgenmagazin" program, he explained 
that "behind the scenes and via diplomatic channels we made 
great efforts to come to this result." The minister of the 
chancellery does not see any parallels with the situation that 
led to World War I. In contrast with 1914, the international 
community this time is in complete agreement. The threat must 
be upheld at all costs, however. Germany must "provide moral and 
political support."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
"categorically" welcomed the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian 
Serbs. At a news conference in Bonn on Thursday [10 February], 
however, he stressed that the final decision about potential air 
strikes remains with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. 
According to the most recent information he has obtained, 
Butrus-Ghali did not state -- in contrast to press reports -- 
that decisions have to be delegated to the UN Security Council, 
Kinkel said. In the view of UN experts, there they would 
probably be blocked by a Russian veto. 
  Kinkel explained the two stages of decisionmaking as 
follows: 
  1. If Sarajevo is attacked again before the deadline 
expires, British General Michael Rose, the local UN general, 
would order countermeasures in coordination with NATO. It is 
not certain whether General Rose has to consult with 
Butrus-Ghali in this case. 
  2. If the heavy Serbian weapons are not withdrawn by 20 
February, as demanded by the ultimatum, NATO will launch air 
strikes as threatened, if such strikes have expressly been 
demanded by the UN secretary general. 
  Kinkel placed great hopes on the possibility that the three 
parties to the conflict, who met for a new round of negotiations 
in Geneva on Thursday, will give in. Without the Serbs, the 
Croats, and the Bosnian Muslims a political solution is 
impossible. At the same time, the foreign minister announced 
new contacts with the Americans, who, with the European Union, 
are examining approaches for political solutions and want to 
include the Russians, who strongly oppose military strikes, in 
this. 
  An 18 February meeting in Athens between Moscow's Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and a delegation of European Union 
ministers is still being examined. The so-called troika 
consists of the foreign minister of the country that holds the 
Presidency, that is, Greece, his predecessor, Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes, as well as his successor, Klaus Kinkel, 
On 1 July, Germany will take over the Presidency. Diplomats 
indicated that a meeting with Kozyrev will probably not be 
possible two days before the expiration of the NATO ultimatum. 
  Kinkel said a repetition of the massacre of Sarajevo will 
"not be tolerated." As soon as the deadline expires on 20 
February, "unauthorized weapons systems will become the target 
of air strikes." German participation, which goes beyond the 
current help in air and sea monitoring as well as in 
humanitarian supplies, is impossible because of the legal 
situation and because of German history. Kinkel pointed to 
military information, according to which NATO's AWACS 
reconnaissance planes, which also carry some German crew 
members, do not have anything to do with leading potential air 
strikes. 
  So far, by paying 612 million German marks, Germany has 
provided more help than any other nation, with the exception of 
the United States. The FRG has accepted more than 400,000 
refugees, Kinkel stated.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: U.S., France Pushing for </F>
NATO Ultimatum"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 9 Feb (ANSA) -- United States and French 
ambassadors to NATO were leading efforts today to overcome their 
Canadian and Greek colleagues' concern over an ultimatum to 
Bosnian Serbs to lift their siege of Bosnian capital Sarajevo, 
French sources reported. "Either there will be a decision 
today, or there will be none. There will be no half-measures," 
the French sources said during a break in the Atlantic Council 
to allow the 16 ambassadors to consult their governments. 
  According to the sources, the U.S.-French ultimatum proposal 
made this morning would give the forces which have been 
bombarding Sarajevo for 22 months 7-10 days to withdraw their 
heavy artillery to 20-30 kilometres from the perimeter of the 
city, or else face air strikes. Most NATO countries have 
expressed support for an ultimatum in response to the worst 
single civilian atrocity of the Bosnian war: the mortar shell 
that killed 68 and wounded over 200 in a Sarajevo market on 
Saturday [5 February]. 
  But Canada is particularly concerned about the possible 
repercussions on its large peacekeeping contingent, encircled at 
Srebrenica, in the wake of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic's threat that "no foreigner will be safe" if air 
strikes are ordered. Greece fears that an escalation of the 
Bosnian war would dangerously raise tensions in Kosovo and the 
rest of the Balkan area. 
  The Council is meeting to respond to United Nations 
Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's call for a NATO green light on 
threatened air strikes to halt the massacre of Sarajevo 
civilians. If the Council approves the ultimatum, the last word 
as regards launching the strikes lies with Butrus-Ghali. 
  (In Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported that Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had written to Butrus-Ghali 
warning of the "extremely serious" consequences of "any air 
strike, even limited to providing air cover" for UN forces. 
Kozyrev was quoted as saying that air strikes "would jeopardise 
the entire UN aid operation." Stressing the priority of a 
political solution to the Bosnian crisis, he reiterated Russia's 
view that before ordering strikes Butrus-Ghali must consult with 
the UN Security Council, where Russia has indicated it will veto 
such a move.)

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Andreatta Warns Against </F>
Building `New Walls'"] 
  [Excerpt] Munich, 6 Feb, (ANSA) -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta today warned the Munich conference on 
international security of the dangers of the West "defending 
itself" against the "uncertainties" of the transition process in 
East Europe and against the difficulties facing the countries in 
the southern rim of the Mediterranean. This twin mistake would 
be "an irresponsible, blind and crucial error" that "we will 
surely pay for", he said, stressing that new international 
security arrangements should offer no scope for "new walls or 
old nuclear umbrellas." 
  "The future of security in Europe depends on the success of 
the development of market economies in East Europe and along the 
southern coasts of the Mediterranean," he said. If this process 
should collapse, he warned, all attempts to "build up 
institutions" or "enact diplomatic designs" are doomed to 
failure because "stable democracies do not bloom amid declining 
economies, growing unemployment and poverty." 
  The West should not take fright at the difficulties of East 
Europe and the southern Mediterranean, he said, recalling that 
just a few decades ago it was unrealistic to aspire to the 
levels of stability and prosperity achieved by the West thanks 
to the determination and cooperation of all Western countries. 
"The disappearance of the Soviet Union may have given the 
impression that this close cooperation is no longer 
indispensable. That is a mistaken impression," he said. 
  Andreatta went on to warn against a growing "nationalisation 
of security perceptions. Dangers, of a lesser intensity than in 
the past but not necessarily less imminent, are perceived 
differently in different capitals," he said, explaining that 
this posed difficulties in presenting a common front, as had 
proved the case regarding former Yugoslavia. 
  Another key concern expressed by the minister is that 
"transatlantic relations should not return to conflictual 
games." He hailed the successful outcome of the GATT 
re-negotiation talks as a move in the right direction, but 
called for a sort of arbitration court (along the lines of the 
European Court of Justice) to rule on trade and legislation 
disputes between the United States and the European Union. 
  Returning to his central theme, Andreatta drove home the 
need 
for a recognition that "economic factors have become a component 
of security, and not merely one of its instruments. The new 
world order we are trying to build, with less optimism but no 
less enthusiasm than a couple of years ago, cannot ignore 
economic considerations," he said, pointing up the importance of 
the new Partnership for Peace with East Europe including 
economic programmes. This, in turn, called for a deepening of 
links between the European Union and East European countries, he 
said, recalling the recent Italo-British proposal to extend 
cooperation to the second and third pillars of the Maastricht 
Treaty, regarding political and justice links. 
  As for the Mediterranean, Andreatta said that the creation 
of 
a single market spanning its northern and southern rims should 
be one of the main international objectives of this decade. He 
stressed the importance of Western assistance -- with the 
security pay-off this can bring -- being in the form of "trade, 
not aid. The best form of assistance we can give is access to 
our rich markets," he said. 
  He rejected the charge of Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, that the West's assistance to Russia masked 
"colonisation" goals, stressing that its aim was to "expand the 
global market. Having stable and satisfied neighbours" would 
then contribute to greater security, he reiterated. 
  Moving closer to home, he said that "the end of Eastern 
Socialism must not be replaced by the end of Western Socialism," 
explaining that the role of government should be one of 
"support" that however stopped short of "interference" in the 
workings of the market. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Andreatta on Russian </F>
Stance, Meets Silajdzic"] 
  [Text] Geneva, 9 Feb (ANSA) -- Russia's firm stance against 
NATO air strikes in Bosnia has changed, as Moscow realises that 
such a move would be "aimed at getting positive results," 
Italy's Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta said Wednesday [9 
February]. 
  Speaking after a meeting with Bosnian Premier Haris 
Silajdzic, where Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin was also present, Andreatta said "my impression was that 
the tension which has risen over the past few days has now 
subsided a lot, and that the Russians realise that NATO action 
(in Bosnia) would be aimed at getting positive results." 
  "It is not our job to use weapons simply for the sake of 
using weapons," Andreatta told the press. "They must be used as 
a political tool for achieving a certain solution. If, as it 
seems, heavy weapons are to be withdrawn, this has already been 
achieved and in this case arms will not be used or will be used 
only where heavy weapons remain in place." 
  The Italian diplomatic chief was referring to a UN-brokered 
ceasefire agreement reached Wednesday afternoon between Bosnian 
Serb and Moslem forces. 
  Andreatta described his talks with Siladjzic as "long and 
complex", with the Bosnian premier offering a view of peaceful 
co-existence between Moslems and Croats "which differed from 
that of peace negotiators and which had both interesting and 
problematic aspects which will have to be studied further."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italian Doctors Treat Victims of </F>
Bosnia War"] 
  [Text] Rome, 7 Feb (ANSA) -- Twelve people among more than 
200 wounded in Sarajevo Saturday [5 February], when a mortar 
round killed 68 people in the city's marketplace, are expected 
to arrive in Italy today for hospitalization here and a team of 
Italian doctors, surgeons and paramedics will be in place in the 
Bosnian capital by the end of the week for the treatment there 
of victims of the violence, the Foreign Ministry reported. 
  A communique issued today said Italy will also send first 
aid 
medical supplies in coordination with the World Health 
Organization. As announced Saturday by Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta, the head of the emergency intervention unit 
at the ministry's Department for Development Cooperation, 
Minister Vitaliano Napoleone, and Agostino Miozzo, a medical 
expert on the department staff, arrived in Sarajevo yesterday. 
  The Italian surgeons will work in the main Sarajevo general 
hospital, the Kosovo Hospital, in conjunction with WHO and will 
be equipped with medical kits sent over. 
  Ten days ago, the communique disclosed, Doctor Miozzo was in 
Sarajevo where he conferred with Bosnian authorities who 
requested pediatric surgeons and specialists in facial and jaw 
surgery, neurosurgeons, and those with experience in 
rehabilitation surgery and war wounds. 
  Following the arrival yesterday of the doctor and the chief 
of the emergency unit, the two Italians made arrangements for 
sending twelve of the victims of the Saturday shelling to Italy, 
where they will be placed under the care of the Social Affairs 
Service of the premier's office. 
  (Reported today in the central Adriatic port city of Ancona, 
near the Falconare Marittima Air Base, were preparations for the 
arrival of a Canadian Air Force Hercules C-130 transport plane 
with 15 of the people wounded in Sarajevo Saturday. 
Accompanying them on the flight, conducted for the United 
Nations High Commission for Refugees, will be an unknown number 
of relatives of the victims. 
  (The first six, all between ages 17 and 25, were scheduled 
to 
leave Sarajevo in the early afternoon and the second group some 
time later in the day, the Social Affairs Service and Italian 
Red Cross said. 
  (It was also learned that an 11-year-old, Vladan Rajcevic, 
who was among those wounded in the marketplace, was still in 
critical condition in Ancona's Salesi Hospital where he is under 
treatment for a perforated lung. The boy's parents, Danilo and 
Retina Rajcevic, deaf mutes, arrived here yesterday.)

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Twelve Agree on Program of Greek </F>
Presidency"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] The president of the Union Council, Theodoros 
Pangalos, briefly presented his colleagues the priorities of the 
Greek presidency, at the now traditional session open to the 
public at the beginning of the "General Affairs" Council. 
Noting that work in the coming half-year would have to be 
greatly accelerated due to the European elections (the last 
parliamentary session will take place early May), Mr. Pangalos 
said in particular that the presidency wanted, before the Corfu 
Summit, to make "great progress" in implementing the 
Commission's White Paper in a concrete manner. Mr. Pangalos 
stressed the importance of the European elections (if the 
citizens are not interested in them, it will be "fatal," he 
said) and considered that the role of the European Commission 
would have to be strengthened. He also reaffirmed that the work 
of the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 on institutional 
reform should begin in good time, reason why the presidency is 
proposing setting up a working party with representatives from 
the Commission, member states, European Parliament [EP] and 
observers from countries wanting accession. As for enlargement, 
he pointed out that, if we want to remain within the deadline 
the dossier would have to be handed to the EP by 10 March at the 
latest. 
  Mr. Pangalos (who informed his colleagues over lunch about 
his rounds of the capitals of the candidate countries) also 
repeated that there were "two small countries in the south that 
had a right to full membership of the Union," i.e. Cyprus and 
Malta. 
  During the nearly two-hour long public session, all the 
ministers stressed the need to: 

  -  Relaunch employment and 
growth by implementing the White Paper; 
  -  Succeed in the Uruguay 
Round in all its details; 
  -  Conclude accession 
negotiations; 
  -  Tighten links with Central and Eastern 
countries; 
  -  Achieve the Common Foreign and Security Policy [CFSP]. 
  Britain's Mr. Hurd urged the member states to do more for 
the 
economy's competitiveness, on the basis of the White Paper: 
"There is no point in accepting the prescription and failing to 
take the medicine." He also said "we should not become fixated 
with institutional problems," as there was a "danger of 
indigestion." Luxembourg's Mr. Poos agreed with this: According 
to him, we should not embark on such a "perilous path" which 
risked compromising the referenda in the candidate countries. 
As for the rest, Mr. Poos insisted on the need really to 
achieve the free movement of goods in the Single Market, while 
strengthening security and cooperation between the forces of law 
and order. Dutchman Mr. Kojmans however was in favor of the 
proposal of setting up a working party on institutional reform 
with the participation of representatives from the European 
Parliament; this would be a demonstration of openness to 
Parliament, which according to him is absolutely vital. The 
Minister recalled that the Netherlands had fought for 
transparency and "true openness in the decisionmaking process": 
We are not satisfied with the results obtained, he said. Mr. 
Kojmans also pleaded in favor of "total free movement," 
regretting the slowness in Maastricht's "third pillar" being 
implemented. Denmark's Mr. Petersen also insisted heavily on 
transparency and Citizens' Europe, and found the Greek 
presidency's program a little weak as regards the introduction 
of the tax on CO2 and energy. Germany's Mrs. Sailer-Albring 
(Mr. Kinkel arrived later) set the problem of the contributions 
by member states in the Community budget (the United Kingdom's 
"rebate" has recently been put into question in Bonn, especially 
by the Social-Democrats -- editor's note), pleading in favor a 
"fair distribution of the charges" which, she said, is a 
commandment of solidarity." Indirectly addressing France (which 
will not ratify the decision on the number of EP seats as long 
as Mr. Klepsch has not signed the lease for the new hemicycle in 
Strasbourg -- editor's note), she stressed the need for all 
member states to adopt the increase in the number of seats in 
time for the European elections. 
  Spanish Minister Mr. Solana was among those who stressed 
the importance of the European elections, saying that the 
European Parliament should make full use of the new competencies 
given it by the Maastricht Treaty. As for enlargement, he said 
that the southern countries should not be forgotten. This was 
also mentioned by Italy's Mr. Andreatta (who in particular 
mentioned Malta), and who moreover stressed that enlargement 
would pose an institutional problem, and spoke in favor of 
Greece's proposal of setting up a working party to prepare for 
1996. The minister, moreover, said that in the enlarged Union 
all farmers will have to be treated equally, whatever the region 
they came from or lived, and that thus the regulations over 
Mediterranean products would have to be renewed. Finally, he 
insisted on developing relations with the East, noting that, 
according to some calculations, only around 1 fifth of trading 
possibilities with these countries are currently being taken 
advantage of. French Minister Mr. Juppe said discussions must 
not get "bogged down" but that the prospects for future 
enlargement of the Union to East Europe must not lead to neglect 
of the south because "the European Union is also a European 
power." Regarding Algeria in particular, he said that if this 
country is not helped, the "domino effect" in the region will be 
"dreadful." Belgian minister Mr. Claes also mentioned the 
situation south of Europe, saying that European security is 
threatened in the South by fundamentalist threats and in the 
East by nationalism. Portuguese minister Mr. Barroso also 
insisted on relations between the Union and the southern 
Mediterranean countries and sub-Saharan Africa, stressing the 
importance of the negotiations with the ACP states to begin 
under the Greek Presidency for a partial review of the fourth 
Lome Convention. Irish minister Mr. Spring called for greater 
participation by the Twelve in the peace efforts in the Middle 
East (which prove, he said, that when there is a will for peace, 
seemingly insoluble disputes can be settled). Mr. Spring also 
recalled that Ireland has begun giving concrete effect to the 
positions set out in the Commission's White Paper, especially 
those concerning the reduction of wage costs. Vice-President 
Manuel Marin said that, for the European Commission, the timing 
of implementation of the White Paper is "of vital importance." 
The member states, which have developed an operational plan 
from the frame of reference set out by this document, must now 
move into action. Mr. Marin highlighted the Commission's will 
to meet the deadline for conclusion of the enlargement 
negotiations but warned that this would take "great efforts" by 
everyone, because "there are numerous obstacles and time is 
flying." The Greek presidency's priorities are the same as the 
Commission's in this period when it is important for the 
institutions to cooperate closely, said the Commissioner. 
  Regarding the finalization of the Uruguay Round, he said the 
Commission is "concerned about the difficulties that have arisen 
in the last few days." As far as external relations are 
concerned, Mr. Marin said the European Union must be able to 
"offer association" to the southern Mediterranean countries and 
underscored the need for a "comprehensive analysis" of relations 
with East European countries.

<F P=106> [Article by West Europe editor Leonard Doyle: "Dutch Fight </F>
EU Code on Secrecy"] 
  [Text] The Dutch European Affairs Minister yesterday 
condemned a new secrecy code restricting access to European 
Union [EU] documents as "worse than the behaviour of NATO at the 
height of the Cold War." 
  Piet Dankert spoke as the Dutch government began legal 
proceedings at the European Court of Justice, challenging a 
Council of Ministers decision greatly restricting public access 
to documents. 
  The Council in December imposed a blanket secrecy order over 
a whole range of documents and proposals from the burgeoning 
Euro-bureaucracy, despite earlier promises of openness. The 
decision caused outrage in the Netherlands, which sees its 
much-praised open system of government being eroded by European 
integration and the secrecy of the Council. 
  The "code of conduct" was agreed by majority vote over 
Dutch, 
Danish and Greek objections, rather than by unanimous assent, 
which Mr Dankert says is required for issues affecting European 
citizens' rights. 
  This bout of Euro-censorship has made the EU even less 
accessible to citizens than before, Mr Dankert believes, and by 
taking the issue to the Court the Netherlands hopes to force a 
wider public debate about the secretive nature of the EU. 
  The Maastricht Treaty put EU justice, foreign, security and 
immigration measures outside the reach of national legislatures 
and the European parliament. Now the latest gagging order has 
smothered hopes of more accountability. Ironically, these were 
expressed in a Council document, which hoped that the public 
would in future be given "the widest possible access to 
documents held by the Commission and the Council." 
  What began as a U.S.-style Freedom of Information Act to 
grant widespread public access to all documents except where 
public safety, monetary stability, privacy, the EU's foreign 
policy, commercial and industrial secrets were involved, was 
overturned by objections from Britain and Germany. Instead, a 
sweeping catch-all provision was inserted allowing the EU to 
refuse requests for information that are deemed "contrary to the 
efficiency and good order of the institution." 
  The Dutch government, alone in the EU, provides its 
parliament with copies of confidential documents so that debates 
can take place before decisions are taken by the EU. This is in 
sharp contrast to Westminster and other EU parliaments where the 
general rule is that confidential Council documents are never 
made available to parliamentarians.

<F P=106> [Report by John Carvel in Brussels: "French Threaten </F>
Euro-Poll Fiasco"] 
  [Text] British elections to the European Parliament are in 
danger of turning into a fiasco because of a row about the 
future location of the parliament between Edouard Balladur, the 
French prime minister, and the majority of MEPs [Members of the 
European Parliament]. 
  Orders will be passed through the Commons this week to fix 
the boundaries of 87 Euro-constituencies to replace the United 
Kingdom's present 81 seats, for polling on June 9. However, 
ministers have been warned the old boundaries may have to be 
reinstated unless the Balladur row is resolved, forcing new 
candidate selections weeks before the election. 
  The Edinburgh summit in 1992 agreed to increase the number 
of 
MEPs to allow representation for eastern Germany. Britain and 
other states upheld national pride by ensuring they too could 
elect more MEPs. 
  Under European Union [EU] rules, the deal falls if not 
ratified by all 12 states. Mr Balladur has told Helmut Kohl, 
the German Chancellor, that France will withhold ratification 
unless the French city of Strasbourg becomes the parliament's 
permanent home. He is demanding Egon Klepsch, the German MEP 
who is the parliament's president, sign a binding contract to 
lease a 225 million pound building which the French want to 
construct in Strasbourg. 
  Non-French MEPs think it would be folly to build another 
parliament. They would prefer to be in Brussels, to oversee the 
Commission, where 600 million pounds is being spent on a 
building already partly completed. 
  Mr Klepsch cannot sign without the approval of various 
parliamentary committees which have not even started to consider 
the matter. 
  The member states' 12 ambassadors to the EU decided last 
week 
it was inconceivable that the elections should leave out eastern 
Germany. It is likely that governments will put heavy pressure 
on MEPs to give way to Mr Balladur.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Membership Negotiations Confirm </F>
Differences With Four Applicant Countries"; as released by 
Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] The new phase of membership negotiations between the 
Community and the four applicant countries, which were held this 
Tuesday [8 February], confirmed the existence of difficulties 
between member states (in defining the "common positions") and 
with the applicants (which reject certain aspects of these 
"common positions"). On Tuesday morning, member states had: 
  (a) defined their position on agriculture by accepting the 
Commission proposal on the immediate alignment of prices (with 
the possibility of transitional national compensation payments); 
  (b) noted certain differences over regional policy 
(definition of regions of Nordic countries falling under 
Objective 1); 
  (c) confirmed their position on the problem of transit 
through Austria. 
  In the afternoon, these total or partial positions were 
presented to the applicant countries in four separate successive 
sessions. The applicants confirmed that: 
  (1) they reject the Community position on agriculture; 
  (2) Austria does not accept that the current transit 
agreement would expire three years after membership and asks 
that it remain valid until 2004; 
  (3) all four maintain for the most part their demands on 
regional matters.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE/RAY: "Pawlak Traces Path for Poland's </F>
Future European Union (EU) Membership"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 3 Feb (BELGA) -- Polish Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak set out on Thursday [3 February] the future 
course for his country's accession to the European Union (EU), 
stressing that while "Poland's political will has already been 
clearly expressed," there is a need to develop in the shortest 
possible term economic relations that will allow Poland to meet 
competition from EU member states. 
  The leader of the Polish Government, who has been in 
Brussels 
since Wednesday, met European Commission's President Jacques 
Delors at noon on Thursday to discuss in particular prospects 
for an association accord uniting the EU with Poland and Hungary 
as well as the "pact for development" as recommended by Warsaw 
to further strengthen the economic ties between the EU and 
Central Europe. 
  "The association accord is of essential significance to us, 
because Poland has been seeking since 1989 to expand all of its 
contacts with the EU. We have thus proposed to supplement the 
Partnership for Peace, which binds us to NATO, with a 
partnership for development," Mr. Pawlak explained at a news 
conference. 
  "We propose an open formula, and we stress the regional 
dimension of this pact, which could take the form of a free 
trade area within the Visegrad group and could strengthen 
economic cooperation with the EU," such as in relation to trade 
in transportation and telecommunications infrastructures, he 
added in substance. 
  But "this cooperation must not solely benefit those sectors 
where profits are most easily obtained," the Polish prime 
minister added, stressing the need for closer cooperation in 
areas such as the processing of agricultural products or coal. 
  Mr. Pawlak and Mr. Delors also spoke of the EU's PHARE 
[Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program of 
economic aid for the countries of Central and East Europe. An 
"overall assessment" of the effectiveness of this program is 
called for, the head of the European executive indicated. 
  Jacques Delors also stressed the need to help the Polish 
authorities to "solve the crucial problem of agriculture, which 
is suffering from internal problems and difficulties in finding 
external markets." The Commission president expressed his 
understanding of the hopes for future membership expressed by 
Poland. "I am not able to say in advance when the conditions 
for Poland's membership will be fulfilled, but the EU has 
already made an unreserved political commitment on its future 
enlargement to include the countries of East Europe. It has the 
historical responsibility to respond to the appeals of these 
countries," he stated. 
  In the meantime, Mr. Delors has given his commitment on 
behalf of the Twelve to increase political contacts with Warsaw 
over the coming months. 
  He believes Poland already fulfills the first condition for 
membership of the Community club by having acquired a democracy 
which is "pluralist and respects human rights." But it will be 
up to the Polish people themselves to say when they will be able 
to satisfy the second condition, which involves an open economy 
that is able to "stand up to the Community economy," he added in 
substance.

<F P=106> [Article signed SDC: "Netherlands Air Force Trains for </F>
Attacks on Bosnia"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Text] The Hague, 9 Feb (ANP) -- F-16 pilots from the 
Netherlands Air Force are to begin exercises -- with real bombs 
-- on Monday [7 February] on the island of Vlieland for two 
weeks. The pilots will soon be serving over Bosnia. 
  During the exercises, the pilots will drop a total of 30 
500- 
pound bombs. Beginning on 1 April the pilots will be flying out 
of the Villafranca base in Italy for missions over Bosnia. 
  The NATO operation over Bosnia is intended to maintain the 
no- fly zone over the war zone by giving air support to the UN 
ground troops and, perhaps, by carrying out air strikes. These 
kinds of offensive actions will be the subject of in-depth talks 
today and Wednesday within NATO as a means of breaking the siege 
of Sarajevo. 
  Regular exercises with real bombs are very controversial for 
the population of the islands of Vlieland and Texel due to the 
noise and damage to the environment and houses. For that 
reason, the Defense Ministry has decided that the exercises will 
be restricted to just half an hour twice a day and not at all on 
the weekends. On both islands there are measuring posts for 
establishing the noise and vibrations caused by the explosions. 
If there is demonstrable damage then the exercise is suspended. 
The same also happens if weather conditions are unfavorable.

<F P=106> [Article by James Adams: " Kneecapped! How Gerry Adams' </F>
U.S. Visit Crippled the `Special Relationship'"] 
  [Text] It looked as though it was going to be a productive 
holiday for Edward Kennedy. As his plane touched down at Dublin 
airport for a Christmas break with his sister, the veteran 
Democratic senator had a hunch he was about to achieve a 
long-held ambition. 
  For years, Kennedy, brother of the assassinated president, 
scion of the premier Irish-American family and prominent 
supporter of a united Ireland, had lobbied to get a lasting 
peace agreement. For years, successive Republican 
administrations had refused to negotiate with terrorists or to 
whisper a word against America's closest ally in this most 
sensitive area of policy. 
  But now the whole political climate had changed. During the 
previous month, it had emerged that the British government had 
been in secret talks with the IRA over a possible ceasefire. 
Then John Major and Albert Reynolds, the taoiseach [Irish prime 
minister], announced their joint declaration, giving Sinn Fein 
the chance of joining the peace process if the IRA stopped its 
terrorist campaign. 
  Kennedy was convinced that he now had the ammunition to get 
his way; he had a powerful ally in his sister. Jean Kennedy 
Smith had been appointed American ambassador in Dublin in June 
last year on her brother's recommendation; in that short time 
she had made an impressive power play to control American policy 
in the whole of Ireland, attempting to wrest control of policy 
in Ulster from Ray Seitz, the American ambassador to London. 
  The Kennedys got to work, organising dinners with Reynolds, 
Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the mainly Catholic Social 
Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), and Brian Lenihan, the 
former Irish foreign minister, at the taoiseach's house. Later 
Kennedy met John Hume, the SDLP leader who had launched his own 
peace initiative with Gerry Adams, the IRA's political front 
man, and Mary Robinson, the Irish president. 
  By the time he headed home on January 2, Kennedy was well 
satisfied that if he pushed for a visa for Gerry Adams, the 
Irish govemment would not stand in his way -- he might even have 
convinced himself that an Adams visit to America might help move 
the stalled peace process forward. 
  As it turned out, the opposite happened. Adams's 48-hour 
trip to America last week ended up as a humiliation for the 
Kennedys, a publicity coup for the IRA and a public relations 
disaster for the British government. It also crippled the 
special relationship which the two nations had cherished for 
half a century. 
  The first sign that Adams might be on his way to America 
came 
at the beginning of January, with a call to the British embassy 
in Washington asking for Sinn Fein's fax number. It came from 
the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a think-tank 
run by an Irish-American businessman, Bill Flynn, which, unaware 
of the Kennedy initiative, had decided to set up a conference in 
New York to bring together all the political parties in Northern 
Ireland. As the alarm bells rang in London, Belfast and 
Washington, the Foreign Office contacted Kennedy's office and 
asked if it knew about the conference. "There was complete 
surprise," said a Foreign Office source. "They were upset as 
they had not yet got their own plans ready and thought the 
invitation had come too early." 
  But Kennedy was not one to waste an opportunity. His 
lobbying had begun a month earlier, after President Clinton had 
written to the then New York mayor, David Dinkins, saying Adams 
would be denied a visa because of his "involvement in terrorist 
activity." That was the eighth time Adams's visa application 
had been turned down. 
  Kennedy mobilised his well-organised staff to set up an 
assault on the administration. Forty Congressmen including 
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York signed a letter to 
Clinton supporting the application. Kennedy himself spoke to a 
number of senior officials and in particular sought out Nancy 
Soderberg, his former foreign affairs aide, now number three in 
the National Security Council (NSC). 
  In her late 30s, with the blond hair of her Swedish 
ancestors, Soderberg is a strong backer of a united Ireland and 
for years has been a point of contact between Kennedy and 
supporters in Northern Ireland. Her appointment to the NSC was 
in part a payoff to Kennedy for his support during the 
presidential campaign. 
  In September, four prominent Irish Americans had visited 
Northern Ireland and met Adams. They returned convinced that an 
earlier administration proposal for a Clinton peace envoy to 
visit the province would not work. Instead, they thought they 
could persuade Clinton to grant Adams a visa. They met 
Soderberg, who agreed to support the application. That time she 
was overruled by the president. This time, she was determined 
to make it happen. 
  Initial soundings by the Foreign Office suggested that the 
Americans' usual opposition to the visa request would hold 
solid. American intelligence had access not only to Adams's 
record of terrorism but also to the current British assessment 
of his influence on the IRA army council, where he is one of 
seven members. 
  More recently, offlcials at the American embassy in London 
had visited Belfast and been briefed by British intelligence on 
Adams's role in organising and ordering recent terrorist 
attacks. The Americans were told that Adams would not accept 
the peace proposals and had no intention of stopping the 
violence. This view was accepted by the Americans and passed to 
Washington. 
  "But there was a different tone this time," said a Foreign 
Office official. "We had the peace proposals and the fact that 
we had secretly been talking with the IRA. That gave the IRA's 
allies (in America) some powerful levers and it was clear we 
were going to have a fight on our hands." 
  Sir Robin Renwick, the mild-mannered yet tough British 
ambassador to Washington, had been preparing for such a 
confrontation ever since he arrived three years earlier. He 
came from the turmoil of South Africa to steer the 
Anglo-American relationship through what was to become the rocky 
road of the Clinton administration. A formidable operator with 
a dry sense of humour, he had assiduously courted senior 
administration officials and his dinner parties had achieved 
legendary status for the range and distinction of their guests. 
  Last month, he hosted a dinner in honour of Michael Howard, 
the home secretary, to which he also invited Louis Freeh, the 
director of the FBI, and Janet Reno, the attorney general. In 
his after-dinner toast, Renwick stressed the role America had 
played in countering IRA terrorism, a message later underlined 
by Howard. In reply, Reno promised that the support would 
continue. 
  Now it was time for Renwick to cash in some of those chips. 
In the course of four days, he contacted Reno, Freeh, Sandy 
Berger, the deputy national security adviser, and Peter Tarnoff, 
the undersecretary for political affairs at the State 
Department. Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, called Warren 
Christopher, his counterpart in the State Department. All 
assured the British officials of their full support: Adams would 
not come. 
  The one holdout was Tony Lake, Clinton's national security 
adviser, who was unconvinced when called by Renwick. The 
position of national security adviser is traditionally held by a 
man with strong views on foreign policy. But Lake has proved 
the exception to this. He has emerged as a conciliator between 
different departments, a man, like the president himself, who 
searches for the middle ground. For months he had been 
criticised for his weak leadership and many of his staff had 
become thoroughly demoralised. Renwick was unable to get a firm 
commitment from Lake. 
  At the same time, lobbying by Kennedy, Ray Flynn, the former 
mayor of Boston and now the Vatican ambassador, Soderberg and 
Jean Kennedy Smith was beginning to pay off. Kennedy had made 
clear that if Clinton wanted his vital support on health care 
and welfare reform, the visa would have to be issued. In an 
administration obsessed by domestic policy, health care clearly 
mattered more than upsetting America's oldest and most faithful 
ally. 
  In cables to Washington, Kennedy Smith said that an Adams 
visit would help the peace process. She also said that the 
Irish government was strongly in favour of a visa being granted. 
This stretched the truth, as Reynolds was largely neutral on 
the matter and Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, assured 
the British that there was no active campaign by the Dublin 
government to get the visa. George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's 
closest adviser, saw the issue as a simple calculation between 
the president's need to keep Congress happy and the marginal 
concerns of a British government to which they owed no favours. 
  The British government's actions during the presidential 
campaign still rankled strongly with Clinton. It was bad enough 
that Conservative Central Office had sent over two officials to 
advise President Bush on the best tactics to win. But Clinton 
was particularly peeved that the government had also launched a 
search of Home Office files to check for evidence of his 
activities while a student at Oxford and whether he had ever 
sought British nationality to evade being drafted for the 
Vietnam war. Such evidence would have sunk the Clinton campaign 
-- it was not something he was going to forgive lightly. 
  The coolness showed when Clinton travelled to Europe for the 
Nato summit on January 10. Major saw the opportunity to press 
his case against Adams being allowed into America and officials 
from the Foreign Office began to push for a bilateral meeting 
between the two leaders. But it was a measure of the state of 
relations between the countries that this was not automatically 
granted. Instead, at the last minute and sandwiched between 
other meetings, a grudging 10 minutes was given to Major. 
Clinton listened to the case but, to the prime minister's 
disappointment, made no promises. 
  In Washington, some administration officials argued to 
Clinton that by letting Adams in, he would play a key part in 
securing peace in Northern Ireland. The president had just 
returned from a successful trip where he had met President 
al-Asad, of Syria, to discuss peace. He had also brokered the 
famous handshake on the White House lawn between Yasir 'Arafat 
and Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister. 
  By January 26, it was clear that the White House was not 
going to be deterred from granting Adams a visa and so the 
Foreign Office agreed a compromise. Adams would be asked: 
Would he personally renounce violence and work to end violence 
in Northern Ireland? Would the IRA and Sinn Fein work for peace 
on the basis of the proposals evolved by Major and Reynolds? 
The British knew that if Adams answered either question 
positively it would be a big step forward. He had never 
renounced all violence and had refused to sign up to the peace 
proposals with unspecified "clarifications." London was 
confident that he had been cleverly boxed in. 
  On Friday, January 28, Adams was summoned to the American 
consulate in Queen Street, Belfast, for a 90-minute meeting with 
Valentino Martinez, the consul-general. Faced with the 
questions, the Sinn Fein leader replied: "If I accept those, I 
might as well retire to the mountains." Martinez pressed Adams, 
but he refused to either condemn all violence or accept the 
peace proposals. In a cable to Washington that afternoon, 
Martinez firmly recommended denying the visa. 
  But immediately after he left the consulate, Adams gave an 
interview to NBC news in which he said that he did indeed 
condemn violent attacks on innocent civilians and that the peace 
proposals were a useful framework. It was this form of words, 
rather than those given to Martinez, that was relayed by 
Soderberg to senior officials in Washington later that day. 
  The British embassy received a copy and was asked for its 
comments. It pointed out that nothing Adams had said was new 
and that he had very specifically not accepted the two questions 
that had been put to him by Martinez. 
  A further wrinkle to the drama was added on Friday afternoon 
when three disarmed grenades were found in San Diego. The 
southern California branch of the Provisional IRA claimed 
responsibility and warned that more would follow if Adams were 
not granted a visa. 
  News of the spoof attack caused near-panic in the 
administration, where there were absurd visions of a full-scale 
campaign against targets in America. But officials also 
recognised that if a visa were granted under such a threat, then 
Clinton would be seen as a weak leader who had caved in to 
blackmail. 
  Fearing that the fight was about to be lost, an 
administration official contacted Adams to alert him to the 
problem. He had heard nothing about the dummy bombs, which had 
received no publicity, apan from a brief mention in the local 
San Diego paper. Adams was only too happy to condemn an attack 
he knew nothing about if it would save his visa application. 
So, once again, Soderberg was able to produce "evidence" that 
Adams was on the side of the angels. 
  Last Sunday morning, in the Oval office, Clinton held a 
meeting with his senior foreign policy advisers. In a heated 
exchange, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, continued 
to oppose the visa, while Lake thought Adams should be allowed 
in. The NSC argued that Adams had complied with all the 
conditions the Americans had set. Although Christopher still 
opposed the visa, he was under the impression, because of that 
NBC interview, that Adams had indeed renounced violence, a lie 
skillfully propagated by the NSC. 
  It was on the basis of this deceit that Clinton went ahead 
and authorised the visa. Adams would be allowed into America 
for 48 hours, prevented from fundraising and ordered to stay 
within 25 miles of New York. Naively, it was believed these 
restrictions would restrain the media circus that the British 
had warned the Americans was certain to be unleashed. 
  Within minutes, news of the decision had leaked -- the White 
House believes from the NSC -- and it was running on the wires 
by Sunday afternoon. To the fury of the British embassy, 
officials heard about the decision not from the administration 
but from the media. It was the start of a week that was going 
to convince some British officials that the administration was 
run by naive incompetents who had little or no understanding of 
foreign policy in general and Irish politics in particular, and 
cared little about tossing the special relationship overboard. 
  With his dark suit, carefully combed hair, manicured teeth, 
white shirt and conservative tie, Adams arrived at Kennedy 
airport to be treated not as a visiting terrorist but as a 
conquering hero. 
  For the next two days the American press indulged in a 
sycophantic orgy of coverage, allowing Adams free rein with his 
Goebbels-like propaganda spree. There was scant mention of the 
IRA, of which he is in charge, or the death toll of innocent 
people, for which he is responsible. The Irish novelist Edna 
O'Brien described Adams in one American paper as "thoughtful and 
reserved, a lithe, handsome man.... Given a different 
incarnation in a different century, one could imagine him as one 
of those monks transcribing the gospel into Gaelic." 
  At each stop, his message was the same and little different 
from the language he used back home. "The largest military 
presence in the north of Ireland is the British army followed by 
the allies of the loyalists and then the IRA. I want to see 
them all disarmed." 
  To the British, this was little more than Orwellian 
doublespeak, at which Adams had become a master. American 
journalists could not grasp that when Adams spoke of peace, he 
meant surrender by his enemies. He was winning the propaganda 
battle and the British appeared helpless to do anything about 
it. By coincidence, Douglas Hurd was in America to visit 
officials in New York and Washington. There is, rightly, a 
standing policy that government ministers do not appear on the 
same programme as terrorists. But instead of finding other ways 
to put the truth about Adams across, Hurd showed almost a 
patrician disdain for becoming involved in the debate. At a 
press conference he said he did not want to answer questions 
about Adams, thereby missing the chance of a robust attack on 
Adams. Nor did the British authorities put up a tough official 
critic to counter Adams's carefully chosen yet meaningless 
phrases about peace. 
  Adams had decided to pack as many appearances as possible 
into his brief visit and each one was carefully selected to 
reach the maximum audience, preferably with a "soft" interviewer 
like Larry King on CNN. He was driven from one studio to 
another with an entourage of bodyguards. No matter that his 
chauffeur was a convicted IRA bomber who had entered America 
illegally and been granted political asylum, the media lapped up 
his every word. At each appearance, the soft-spoken Adams 
preached the same message: it was the British government and not 
Sinn Fein that was the real obstacle to peace. 
  As the extent of the coverage emerged, it began to dawn on 
the White House that it had blundered and a disaster was 
unfolding. "They were warned what would happen but they honestly 
believed nobody would pay any attention to the visit," said one 
British official. "That may be hard to understand but it is 
true and a measure of just how ignorant the officials are." 
  Here was Adams, making speech after speech, but there was 
none of the public commitment to stop all violence that Kennedy 
and his allies had been promising. There was nothing, either, 
about accepting the terms of the peace accords agreed last 
December. 
  With rising alarm, both the White House and the NSC made 
calls to Kennedy, insisting that Adams had to make a positive 
statement that could be presented as some kind of breakthrough. 
First, the reply came that Adams would renounce all violence 
before he left. Then he was going to announce a three-month 
ceasefire during his speech at the conference on Tuesday. 
Finally, Adams promised a dramatic announcement before he took 
the aircraft home on Wednesday. As each opportunity passed with 
another promise broken, the administration began to understand 
it had been duped. 
  When Hurd went to see vice-president Al Gore on Tuesday he 
brought with him the headiines from the British papers which had 
been united in their condemnation of the visit and of the 
Clinton administration. Gore, who had favoured the Adams visit, 
was shocked and immediately issued a statement which called on 
the Sinn Fein leader to accept the framework of the 
Major-Reynolds peace proposals. Later that day, the president 
backed that line and announced that any idea of sending a peace 
envoy to Northern Ireland had been dropped. 
  "Part of the incompetence is that the administration had no 
idea what the impact of the visit would be," said one Foreign 
Office official. "To puncture your relations with your closest 
ally and not realise you are doing so is quite a spectacular 
feat." 
  As he headed back to Ireland on Wednesday, Adams promised 
that he would be looking at the peace process "in a more 
concrete way." The phrasing ofthis statement was designed to 
appease his American supporters and act as the important 
statement he had promised Ted Kennedy. In fact, he achieved 
neither. 
  To Clinton and the Adams supporters in the administration, 
the visit was a profound disappointment. Instead of the 
breakthrough they wanted, Adams, the consummate political 
operator, made fools of all of them by promising everything and 
delivering nothing. 
  Officials spent the end of the week running for cover. 
Gore's office leaked that the trip was nothing to do with him; 
the State Department made clear that it was all the NSC's fault; 
while Soderberg was nowhere to be seen. "There is a smell of 
burned fingers around town," said one senior British official. 
  As usual, it was a glittering occasion when Robin Renwick 
hosted a dinner party last Thursday in honour of Lady Thatcher, 
who was visiting America to be enrolled as chancellor of William 
and Mary College. The guest list was a distinguished one, with 
Dick Cheney, the former defence secretary, Bob Gates, the former 
head of the CIA, Brent Scowcroft, the former national security 
adviser, and other senior officials from previous Republican 
administrations. 
  The talk was all of how things used to be, when Britain and 
America stood shoulder to shoulder against the Soviet Union. It 
was a paean to a bygone era which the British government would 
like to think will return, but most now accept has gone, perhaps 
forever. 
  To Thatcher, the visit had a particular piquancy. The next 
night she gave the toast at a dinner to celebrate the 83rd 
birthday of Ronald Reagan. Over a decade, the two had forged an 
extraordinary friendship that had brought Britain and America 
closer together than at any time since the second world war and 
had played a crucial role in bringing the cold war to an end. 
  Friends were quick to point out that Thatcher would never 
have allowed the Adams visa to have been issued without picking 
up the phone and calling "Ron" to demand a hearing. It is 
striking that Major failed to do that, recognising perhaps that 
he would be rebuffed. His only recourse was to call in Seitz, 
the ambassador, to remonstrate with him over American policy. 
It was, as The New York Times commented, "a diplomatic demarche 
virtually unknown in recent memory." 
  While last week's fiasco over Adams may have been the symbol 
that finally laid to rest the special relationship, the 
destruction of its foundations began the day Thatcher was 
toppled from power. It was undermined still further when 
Clinton entered the White House a year ago. 
  Although the 47-year-old president had been a Rhodes Scholar 
at Oxford, he has no particular fondness for Britain. Other 
"Rhodies" around him, including Stephanopoulos and Strobe 
Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, regale friends with 
stories of the slights they received as "Yanks at Oxford." 
  Culturally, too, Washington has begun a divorce from London. 
The generation in power today is the first to have no 
representatives who fought alongside the British in war. This 
is also a generation to whom Europe, and particularly Britain, 
are seen as a kind of cultural theme park that has been left 
behind by the economic tide. Brought up without the "baggage of 
history," their eyes are focused instead on the American economy 
and domestic affairs. 
  As a result, their gaze, when it is lifted from the 
minutiae of health and welfare reforms, looks in only one 
direction: to the Pacific Rim. They believe that America can 
only boost its recovery and secure its long-term economic future 
by focusing on the Pacific "tigers" which are bounding ahead in 
economic growth. This new America wants a slice of the action 
and looks hungrily at markets in the vast economy of Japan a 
booming China and South korea. 
  Clinton and his advisers believe these markets were largely 
ignored by Reagan and Bush and are determined not to repeat the 
mistake. Today, the Pacific Rim contains almost half the 
world's GNP, $120 billion of American exports, keeps 2.3 million 
Americans in jobs, is three times America's trade with Latin 
America and accounts for 50 percent more trade than America has 
with West Europe. 
  To underline this shift in policy, Clinton hosted a summit 
in 
Seattle last November of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum designed to find new ways to develop an economic and 
security relationship among the 14 members. There is even talk 
that Nafta, which brings together the United States, Canada and 
Mexico in a trade pact, could be extended across the Pacific to 
some of these countries, creating a formidable rival to the 
European Community. 
  Normally, the United States is careful to play down these 
realities so as not to alarm its European allies, but in a 
significant statement last year Christopher admitted that "West 
Europe is no longer the dominant area of the world." Stung by 
European criticism, he is now more diplomatic, saying that 
America is seeking only a "new balance" in its relations with 
Europe and Asia. 
  It has been hard for British officials to adjust to the 
change. Both Reagan and Bush were on the phone every week to 
Thatcher when she was prime minister, discussing all aspects of 
world affairs and allowing Britain to "punch well above its 
weight." But her departure meant a subtle Atlantic sea change: 
suddenly Britain was run by a grey figure who lacked the iron 
lady's chutzpah. 
  That change was abruptly and rudely reinforced by Clinton. 
Here was a new president intent on not allowing his domestic 
policy-- which won him the election and may secure a second 
term--being sidelined by foreign affairs unless it could boost 
his standing and that of the American economy. 
  Britain, as part of a self-preoccupied continent in 
recession, barely "featured on his radar screen." Acutely aware 
of the Tories' role in trying to disrupt his campaign, he also 
personally had no fondness for Britain or its leader. His 
relationship with Major is at best "respectful but not close." 
At worst, according to one White House aide, "it is lousy. He 
doesn't like Major and never thinks of asking his views." He 
also knows the prime minister is in political trouble, and this 
in turns further weakens his international standing. 
  The contacts are now strictly rationed, with barely a 
monthly 
phone conversation between the two leaders. In one celebrated 
incident, Major rang the president to congratulate him on the 
signing of the Nafta agreement. Clinton was "unavailable" and 
did not bother to ring back until three days later. 
  Bosnia has served all too clearly to expose the rifts. 
America wants bombing raids on Serbian forces and the lifting 
of an arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims, policies that have 
been opposed by Britain. Here, too, Clinton has succeeded in 
humiliating Major: in talks last year Clinton made an 
embarrassing aside about how Major had privately confessed that 
he could not support lifting the arms embargo because his 
government might fall; it was hardly the stuff of a special 
relationship. 
  In truth, when he does turn his mind to foreign affairs, 
Clinton concentrates on Asia. His policy in Europe is to keep 
out of trouble and hope Russia does not explode. The only two 
leaders he is comfortable with are Boris Yeltsin and Helmut 
Kohl, with whom one diplomat wittily commented he shares the 
same healthy appetite. 
  When Major comes to Washington to meet Clinton at the end of 
this month, there will be much talk about Bosnia, Russia, trade, 
the success of Gatt and so on. It is unlikely that they will 
dwell too long on the Adams affair, but the scars will be 
profound. 
  By the end of last week, a senior State Department official 
dismissed the row as a mere "blip" in an enduring relationship. 
That analysis is not shared by the British. Even experienced 
diplomats talk derisively about the "incompetence" and "naivety" 
of senior officials. Where once there was forgiveness for 
mistakes in places like Somalia and Haiti, there is now a clear 
judgment that this administration is both unprofessional and 
dangerous. 
  Maybe the Americans will, as has happened in the past, find 
their new friends far from reliable in a crisis, and come 
running back to embrace sturdy, loyal Britain. According to 
this fantasy--for that is all it is at present--once again the 
telephone lines will start humming and the warmth will return to 
melt the ice. But as one diplomat said last week, "I wouldn't 
bet my last buck on it."

  [Text] Bratislava -- The strength of the Bundeswehr will 
probably be reduced to about 300,000 men over the next few 
years. DPA learned this today on the sidelines of Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe's visit to the Slovak Army in Bratislava. 
He stressed that, because of the bad financial situation, the 
strength of the German armed forces can "by no means" be kept at 
the level of 370,000 men, as agreed between Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl and the former Soviet State President Mikhail Gorbachev at 
their meeting in the Caucasus. 
  In the future, the Bundeswehr's personnel might consist of 
about 200,000 in the army, approximately 80,000 in the air 
force, and 20,000 in the navy. At the "Munich Conference for 
Security Policy" last weekend [5-6 February], clear differences 
of opinion emerged between Kohl and Ruehe over the future 
strength of the German armed forces. Contrary to his former 
attitude, Kohl insisted on 370,000 soldiers. This was 
interpreted as efforts "designed not to lose any votes" in 
election year, despite the tight financial situation. 
  Ruehe demonstratively refrained from mentioning figures, and 
he smiled meaningfully at the chancellor's statements. Recently 
the minister has stressed that he does not think much of the 
"ongoing speculations about figures." However, when he 
presented his ideas last week as to how he wants to handle 
further cuts in the defense budget involving 1.25 billion German 
marks, he made it clear that the Bundeswehr will not have 
370,000 men by the end of this year, as originally planned, but 
at most about 345,000. 
  Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD], explained in Munich that there are "not really 
any serious differences" between his party and the government on 
foreign and security issues. At the SPD congress last autumn, 
the SPD spoke in favor of a Bundeswehr of 300,000 men.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has assured 
Algeria that it will not tolerate criminal acts by Islamic 
fundamentalists. As the Bonn Foreign Ministry reported on 
Tuesday [8 February], FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel promised 
this in Brussels on Monday during a meeting with his Algerian 
counterpart, Mohamed Saleh, which focused on the ban on 
political activities by Rabah Kebir, which had been announced by 
Bonn. Kebir, who has applied for asylum in Germany, belongs to 
the leadership circles of the extreme, militant "Islamic 
Salvation Front" (FIS) in Algeria, which the government holds 
responsible for numerous murders of foreigners.

<F P=106> [By Gabrielle Grenz] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, Feb 9 (AFP) -- The January 1, 1995 
deadline for bringing Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into 
the European Community looked increasingly problematic Wednesday 
[9 February] after each nation hit EC negotiators with demands 
for aid and protection for key lobbies. 
  For all but Sweden, the first major problem encountered in 
negotiations here Tuesday was the candidates' refusal to 
immediately align their heavily subsidised farm sectors with the 
EC common agricultural policy (CAP) because they fear prices 
will plummet by 50 percent, with income following suit. 
  Only Sweden agreed to comply on this point here on Tuesday. 
  Helsinki, Oslo and Vienna have ruled out the idea of a 
transition period during which they would pay compensation -- at 
their own expense -- to their farmers. 
  "Never has the European Community agreed to see farm prices 
plunge by 50 percent from one day to the next. Even under CAP, 
it allowed three years to reduce subsidised beef prices by 15 
percent," Norwegian Commerce Minister Grete Knudsen thundered 
after the meeting. 
  Compensation should be financed by the EC budget, to which 
Norway and the other three candidates will become net 
contributors, she added. 
  Norwegian farms are mainly small and scattered through the 
countryside. They suffer from difficult geographic and 
climactic conditions -- summer is very short. "That's why we 
want access to Community funds to maintain our long-term aid, 
which the Community has rejected," the minister said. 
  She recalled that Norway offered an "attractive market for 
European exporters." 
  EC Council President Theodore Pangalos, answered for the EC: 
"Of course, farmers will be hit by the drop in prices, but for 
the consumers it will mean cheaper food products, and a rich 
country like Norway can cope with that." 
  Oslo also wants to use Community aid funds to prevent the 
desertification of its polar region, which has a population of 
four residents per square kilometer and shares a common border 
with Russia, Knudsen said. 
  Helsinki used the same argument about the need to maintain 
security in the far north of Europe to call for part of the EC 
structural funds reserved in principle for areas that are 
backward in development. 
  For Brussels, however, the Arctic regions do not qualify as 
backward areas because their gross national product per 
inhabitant is more than 80 percent of the Community average. 
  Stockholm also sought generous aid for its Norbotten region 
near the polar circle "so as not to be left behind" in case its 
two neighbours got their requests satisfied, said Swedish 
European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel. 
  "We are investing a lot of money in this region and we're 
counting on Community support to recover it," he said. 
  Austria's problem is with its high level of support for 
Alpine agriculture. Vienna wants the Community to accept its 
definition of mountain farming as starting at 500 meters (1,625 
feet) altitude, compared with the EC's current 800 meters (2,600 
feet). 
  Devoted environmental protectionists, the Austrians also 
want 
to maintain their current limits on European trucks using their 
roads even after joining the Community. 
  Brussels is ready to allow a three-year transition period, 
until 1998, but Vienna wants to continue the limitations up 
until the year 2004, in a bid to reach its target of reducing 
pollution by 60 percent. 
  Opposing this effort is the EC's principle of free 
circulation. 
  Another inacceptable demand from Austria is the country's 
prohibition on non-Austrians buying holiday homes in the country 
on grounds this could cause real estate prices to rocket, as has 
been the case in the Tyrol, a favourite holiday spot for Germans. 
  Meanwhile Norway wants to be allowed to continue hunting 
whales. It has asked the EC to cross whales off its list of 
endangered species. 
  The ministers are due to meet again on February 21 and 22 to 
continue discussions. A final meeting could be held from 
February 25-28, diplomatic sources said. 
  The negotiations with the four must be concluded by March 1 
under an EC timetable fixed to allow membership agreements to be 
drawn up before European elections in June.

<F P=106> [Christopher Lockwood report: "EC Applicants Reject </F>
`Unfair' Terms of Entry"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Plans to add four new members to the 
European Community were in crisis last night as all the 
applicants condemned the terms of the offer. 
  Austrian, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish diplomats all 
confirmed that their foreign ministers had raised objections to 
the package. 
  "We are very disappointed and deeply concerned," the Finnish 
Foreign Ministry said after hearing the final offer made 
yesterday. 
  A senior Austrian negotiator said the EC position was 
"completely unacceptable." 
  The two key areas of concern are agriculture and regional 
aid. The EC has demanded that the four must harmonise 
agricultural prices with EC levels from the moment of entry, 
which poses enormous problems for Norway and Finland, where farm 
subsidies push prices far higher. In Finland prices are roughly 
twice the EC level. 
  The cost of any transitional relief payments to farmers 
would 
also have to be met by the individual governments. 
  The four countries were also disappointed that the EC 
rejected a list of regions which they said should receive 
development aid. 
  The three Nordic countries proposed their Arctic regions, 
and 
Austria its Alpine ones. All four governments need to show 
voters they are getting a healthy slice of money in return for 
funds paid in. Otherwise, referendums on EC entry are likely to 
produce a "No" vote later this year. 
  The problem is that the proposed regions are too rich to 
qualify for aid, but the four argue that the rules discriminate 
against them, and that the EC has regularly breached them 
anyway. Spain and Portugal, major beneficiaries of the fund, 
blocked acceptance of the list. 
  Austria also has a problem with a system that limits the 
number of lorries which use it as a short cut to East Europe. 
It won the right to keep the system until 2005, but the EC 
wants to cut this back to 1998. 
  It also bans foreigners from owning holiday homes in its 
Tyrol region, and has been told -- principally by Germany -- 
that this must stop.

<F P=106> [Article by Aslak Bonde: "Svalbard Demands Will Not Be </F>
Raised"] 
  [Text] Norway will not bring up the problems concerning 
Svalbard in the European Union (EU) negotiations. Our demands 
have met with so much opposition that we do not dare raise them. 
  "Norway thinks the area between Svalbard and the Norwegian 
mainland is part of Norway's continental shelf, but inquiries 
have shown that the EU countries do not share this view. 
Therefore we suggest that this problem not be taken up in the EU 
negotiations." 
  That, in plain language, is the conclusion concerning the 
Norwegian list of demands with respect to Svalbard--in addition 
to making a request that Svalbard be kept outside the EU, as we 
did in 1972 and in the EEA negotiations. The latter is not 
particularly controversial, but it is surprising that we will 
not take up the problematic issues where Svalbard is concerned. 
  In the fishing section of the EU negotiations, Norway has 
made demands that logically lead to a new demand to retain full 
control over the fishing resources around Svalbard. 
  In addition, Norwegian senior officials spent several months 
visiting the capitals of all the EU countries in order to 
ascertain the possibility of taking up the unsolved Svalbard 
problems in the EU negotiations. Norway was considering asking 
the EU to accept the Norwegian interpretation of the area 
covered by the Svalbard treaty. So far Finland is the only 
country that supports us. 
<H5>  Interpretation Dispute </H5>
  The divisive issue is this: Norway thinks the Svalbard 
treaty 
applies only to the islands and a small strip of coast around 
them, while most other countries think the treaty also applies 
to the ocean areas off Svalbard. These contain rich fishing 
resources and possibly other potentially valuable resources. If 
the Svalbard treaty applies in this area, all the countries that 
have signed it (around 40 so far) have an equal opportunity to 
utilize the resources. 
  The interpretation dispute arose in the 1970's, and since 
then Norway has behaved as if the area around Svalbard is 
Norwegian. We have established a protected zone for fish where 
we have assumed/usurped full administrative responsibility. This 
has been accepted in practice by most other nations, but both 
the Coast Guard and the Ministry of Fisheries wanted Norway to 
use the EU negotiations to secure better international legal 
protection for the ocean areas off Svalbard. 
  Thus the government's decision not to bring the problems 
into 
the negotiations may be initially controversial. However, there 
is little to indicate that there will be loud protests. 
  This is because of the reasons cited by the government: If 
we 
had taken up these problems in the negotiations, we would have 
lost. There was a big risk that we would have actually forced 
the EU to formulate written standpoints that are directly 
opposed to the Norwegian position. Today the opposition is only 
tacit. 
  The list of demands concerning Svalbard refers to the short 
timetable for the EU negotiations. The Norwegian consultations 
in the EU countries apparently showed that much more time would 
be needed to win support for the standpoints that are 
specifically Norwegian in terms of international law. 
  An overall evaluation of the negotiation situation also 
indicated the advisability of dropping the Svalbard problems. 
Norway has enough problems with its uncompromising demands with 
respect to fishing and agricultural and regional subsidies. 
There was a reluctance to introduce new ones unnecessarily. 
  Those who are most concerned with maintaining Norwegian 
sovereignty over the ocean areas around Svalbard can also point 
out that Norway actually does establish Norwegian sovereignty in 
the document of demands. All we are saying is that we will not 
fight for it just now. 
  One can also point to the Norwegian demand to manage all the 
fish resources in northern waters. It is only logical to assume 
that Norway has the same view when it comes to fish in the 
northern waters around Svalbard. It is true that the European 
Commission did not interpret it that way in its reply to the 
Norwegian fishing demands, but that is of secondary importance 
in this context.

<F P=106> [Article by Morten Fyhn: "Big European Economic Area Package </F>
Ready"] 
  [Text] Brussels--There has been a breakthrough in the tough 
negotiations between the European Union (EU) and the European 
Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries on a big package of 
supplementary regulations that will be included in the European 
Economic Area (EEA) agreement. 
  Completely overshadowed by the negotiations on EU 
membership, 
the EFTA countries and the European Commission have now reached 
agreement on the big package of approximately 400 EU directives 
that will become part of the EEA agreement. The so-called EEA-II 
agreement can now be submitted to the EU and EFTA countries for 
final approval before it goes into effect, probably on 1 July of 
this year. 
  "We feel very relieved," Foreign Ministry Deputy Secretary 
Per Ludvig Magnus told AFTENPOSTEN. He stressed that the 
commission and EFTA now have the final political framework for 
EEA-II ready, but that nothing will be settled until the 
countries have debated the matter. The supplementary package 
must receive final approval from the EEA Committee on 8 March 
before it is ratified by the European Parliament and the 
national assemblies in the EFTA countries. 
  EEA-II consists of all the new directives the EU has adopted 
between 1 August 1991 and the end of this year. The EFTA 
countries will not really be able to reap the benefits of the 
EEA agreement until this package has received final approval, 
the EFTA pointed out. Norway has been particularly concerned 
with shipping and the rules on harmonizing standards for plant 
and animal health. EEA-II also, however, involves free market 
access for large parts of the service sector, transportation, 
and mutual approval of qualifications and job training 
certificates for nonacademic occupations. 
  Norway and the EU have still not resolved the remaining 
problems connected with transporting fish and antidumping, while 
Austria lacks agreement on the transit of heavy vehicles. 
<H5>  Timetable </H5>
  Having a complete EEA agreement in place appears 
increasingly 
important as a result of new signals that the EU membership 
negotiations will probably take longer than planned. Hans van 
den Broek, the European Commission's foreign affairs 
commissioner, has now said openly that the European Parliament 
cannot count on being presented with the full text of the 
agreement with the applicant countries by 1 March. 
  He hopes the parliament will agree to begin its 
deliberations 
on the basis of a general summary of the results of the 
negotiations so that the finished texts can come at a later 
date. The European Parliament must approve the agreement with 
applicant countries by 4 May at the latest. If this deadline is 
not met, the debate will not take place before fall with the 
result that new members cannot be accepted before the summer of 
1995 at the earliest.

  [Text] The Swiss foreign minister Flavio Cotti says there 
is no alternative for Switzerland than to eventually join the 
European Union [EU]. Mr. Cotti, speaking at Zurich University, 
said such problems in Europe as crime, transport, and 
environmental policies could no longer be solved on a national 
or regional basis. He said the EU was still far from being a 
perfect organization, but was already a crucial guarantor for 
regional stability.

  [Text] Basel, Switzerland, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Frenchman Robert 
Raymond has been appointed managing director of the new European 
Monetary Institute [EMI] by its Board, the latter announced here 
on Tuesday [8 February] after a meeting. 
  The Board consists of the 12 European Community central bank 
governors and of institute president Alexandre Lamfalussy of 
Belgium. The institute is the forerunner of the European 
Community's central bank. 
  Raymond, 60, is managing director for credit at the Bank of 
France, the French central bank. 
  The institute Board also appointed the heads of three of the 
five departments within the European Monetary Institute. 
  Dutchman G.P.J. Hogeweg, coordinating director at the Dutch 
central bank, will head the Economics and Statistics Department. 
  Hanspeter K. Scheller, from the secretariat of the E.C. 
governors' committee, will head up the general secretariat. 
  And J.S. Etherington of the Bank of England will manage the 
Department for Communication and Information Systems. 
  Lamfalussy told correspondents that "one or two appointments 
have not yet been decided on at this stage." The institute also 
has an Administration Division and a Finance Division. 
  On another matter, Lamfalussy said the European Community 
central bank governors were not much worried about consequences 
of the mild increase in U.S. interest rates announced on Friday 
by the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
  He said after a meeting in Basel with governors of E.C. 
central banks that "The consensus was that some such measure had 
been expected, and that it was not really a surprise." 
  "The majority of the governors thought that, so far, the 
financial markets' reaction had been relatively calm. The 
governors did not express any major worries about the conduct of 
European monetary policies, at this stage."

  [Text] Aggressors only understand the language of 
violence. As soon as it became clear that NATO was heading for 
an ultimatum to the murderous Serbian gunners around Sarajevo, 
the Bosnian Serbs speedily prepared to withdraw their heavy 
weapons before the adoption of a resolution. Here only the 
threat with the ultimatum worked. For the time being. If the 
pressure on the Serbs decreases again, they will again strike 
like birds of prey that have been driven away. On the other 
hand, the Muslims want more than only not to be massacred any 
longer. This is Clinton's hour. He worked toward the 
ultimatum. At full risk: His presidency can be destroyed if he 
gets dragged into a Balkan war. This will surely be the case if 
the threat with the ultimatum is not implemented. Aggressors 
only understand the language of violence -- if the preparedness 
for action is behind it.

<F P=106> [Robert Stoppacher report on news conference by Austrian </F>
Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak on 10 February; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The Antiterrorism Task Force has struck again. 
A 24-year-old right-wing extremist has been arrested in 
connection with the series of letter bomb attacks. Interior 
Minister Franz Loeschnak confirmed this today. He did not want 
to disclose any details on the man's role. [passage omitted] 
  Reportedly, the recently arrested man is part of the 
leadership of the terrorist group called Extraparliamentary 
Opposition Loyal to the People, with which Peter Binder and 
Franz Radl Junior are also affiliated. These two right-wing 
extremists have been imprisoned for many weeks. Loeschnak says 
that they are supposedly behind the wave of terrorism. By the 
way, the interior minister also talks for the first time of 
concrete proof against the suspects, not mere circumstantial 
evidence. 
  At any rate, right-wing extremism in Austria has altogether 
become more violent. This is also shown by the criminal 
statistics presented by the Interior Ministry, which, however, 
in general indicates a gratifying reversal of the trend. After 
years of increasing crime rates, the figures for 1993 show, for 
the first time, a slight decrease. The number of crimes and 
criminal offenses is just under 500,000, as compared to 502,000 
the year before. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Christine Domforth: "Republic of Austria Resumes </F>
Guarantees for Credits to Poland"] 
  [Excerpt] A few years ago following U.S. pressure, Poland 
was granted a 50-percent reduction of its foreign debts. For 
Austria, which had 40 billion schillings in claims in export 
credits, the redemption of these debts means a burden on our 
budget of between 2.5-2.8 billion schillings a year. In the 
meantime, however, Poland's credit rating has significantly 
changed. 
  As Gerhard Praschak, managing director of the Austrian 
Control Bank (OeKB), told DIE PRESSE, guarantees for Poland 
credits are available again. "Experience in new transactions is 
excellent, the Poles are fully rehabilitated," Praschak said by 
way of explaining this decision in terms of economic policy. 
Although export guarantees are handled by the OeKB, it is the 
Federal Government, and thus ultimately the taxpayer, that 
assumes the liability. Still, liability fees for Poland are 
relatively high, namely 3 percent, while for exports to Slovakia 
they are only at 1.5 percent. 
  There are still no guarantees for exports to Russia, while 
Iran and Algeria have become new "problem cases." In both 
countries, credits granted by Austria amount to some 12 billion 
schilling. In the case of Iran, which is paying back debts only 
very slowly, Praschak expects a "de facto rescheduling of 
debts," since, owing to political resistance from the United 
States, an official one is hardly possible. Algeria is also 
again and again being regarded as a rescheduling candidate, even 
though Austrian credits have hitherto always been serviced. 
  In the past few years, the OeKB had to put up with a 
50-percent reduction of its export guarantee turnover. In 1990 
the figure was still 95 billion schillings, and in 1991 81 
billion schillings. The loss of exports to the USSR and 
Yugoslavia, the decrease in project deals and exports to the 
Arab countries, which declined as a result of lower oil prices, 
resulted in a reduction of the guarantee turnover to 48 billion 
schillings in 1992. Guarantees went down further to 45 billion 
schillings in 1993, Praschak said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "SN": "Recession in Industry Seems To Have </F>
Bottomed Out"] 
  [Excerpts] Vienna -- Judging by the order books it looks 
as if the recession in the Austrian industry might bottom out in 
the course of the year. According to calculations by the 
Economic Research Institute (Wifo), companies received more 
orders on an average over the past few months than one year 
earlier, and in November order books, for the first time, were 
fuller than in the previous year. 
  The economy further consolidated in the fall. Industrial 
production remained almost stable,, falling short of production 
figures of one year ago only by about 1.5 percent between 
September and November. The economic researchers have based 
their optimism mainly on the recovery of the sector of products 
for further processing, which tends to precede economic 
developments. The textile and clothing industry and the 
producers of capital goods once more had to significantly cut 
back production. 
  The negative developments in last year's export figures 
improved over the past few months. Remarkable results were 
achieved by Austrian exports overseas (Southeast Asia and the 
United States, in particular): November exports to the "Four 
Dragons" increased by 19 percent, and to the United States by 28 
percent over the previous year. The increase in orders from 
abroad in a number of industries gives rise to the hope that the 
export industry will soon free itself from stagnation. One 
important condition for it is a stable upward trend in Germany. 
Developments in the German economy have been relatively 
favorable in the past few months. There is, however, a major 
discrepancy between increasing orders from abroad and a weak 
demand at home. The risk that lack of confidence among German 
consumers might impair the recovery must not be underestimated. 
[passage omitted] 
  In Austria, the rate of inflation remained at 3.5 percent in 
December, too, falling by only about 0.5 percentage points in 
the course of 1993 despite the recession. The increase of 
prices for industrial products (plus 3.2 percent) and private 
services (plus 5.7 percent) remained almost undiminished. 
Public rates increased more strongly in the course of the year 
(reaching plus 4.9 percent in December). Prices for energy and 
food were tending to check price rises. 
  On the labor market economic recession and the pressure of 
rationalization measures resulted in a major reduction of jobs 
in industry (October: minus 37,000 or minus 7 percent). Total 
employment, however, remained virtually stable due to additional 
demand for labor by the public sector, the health sector, 
economic services, and the construction industry. The increase 
in registered unemployed continually diminished: from plus 
40,000 in March 1993 to plus 11,000 in January 1994.

<F P=106> [Article signed GF: "PS and PSC Willing To Discuss Amnesty"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- The PS [Socialist Party] and PSC [Social 
Christian Party] are willing to have a discussion on amnesty. 
Yesterday, the party executives of both French-speaking parties 
unanimously approved a statement to that effect. The word 
amnesty is not pronounced, but during a press conference after 
the weekly meeting of the PS party executive, PS Chairman 
Philippe Busquin used the word without any hesitation. This had 
never happened before within the PS. The PSC is willing "to 
examine the family consequences of the postwar measures case by 
case." 
  The PS party executive subscribed to the words of Arthur 
Haulot, "the conscience of the resistance to fascism." In an 
appeal published in LE SOIR, Arthur Haulot stated he was no 
longer opposed to a "case by case investigation of those who ask 
for compassion," in a spirit of peace on the occasion of the 
fiftieth anniversary of our Liberation. As a resistance 
fighter, Haulot was arrested by the Gestapo in 1941, and 
survived three and one-half years at the concentration camps of 
Mauthausen and Dachau. By referring to the very old Haulot to 
tone down its implacable position on amnesty, the PS secures 
itself the best possible guarantee against protests by its rank 
and file. 
  The PS statement says that "social consequences for the 
relatives of the condemned people can be seriously examined case 
by case." This sentence is very similar to that of the PSC text. 
  In the PS' and PSC's view, amnesty is rejected for 
collaboration with the enemy, and only applies to the social and 
family consequences of collaboration. 
  The PS also emphasizes that it continues to be committed to 
"the democratic values." Busquin explained that after the 
elections, the PS will not form any coalitions with 
ultra-rightwing parties.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Rolf Falter: "A Late Gesture"] </F>
  [Text] Is the position taken yesterday by the bureau of the 
PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] on King Albert's call for 
national reconciliation, fifty years after World War II, a new 
feature? Undoubtedly, even though its effect will be minimal. 
  The core of the amnesty issue concerns the question of 
whether, in Belgium's name, injustice occurred when 
collaboration was punished. And if yes, how should that 
injustice be made up for? Luc Huyse's pathbreaking work three 
years ago showed that in the first months repression was far 
stronger than afterwards, far more severe on political compared 
with economic collaboration, and partisan in its attempt to 
remove Flemish nationalism as a political factor. 
  Anyone with doubts after this report should then read the 
memoirs of Eyskens senior: He thought that it was normal for 
any self-respecting state to punish collaboration severely, but 
at the same time described the many occasions he had to 
intervene to prevent excesses and help those condemned, even 20 
years after the war. 
  In Flanders in the decades after the war, immediate amnesty 
was presented as a means to compensate for these injustices; 
this would entail the pardon of all those condemned. But in 
recent decades this demand became excessively associated with 
extreme right-wing groups in Flanders. At the same time every 
French-speaking politician was all too eager to translate 
amnesty as unacceptable moral forgiveness of collaboration. 
Therefore first Hugo Schiltz, then Luc Huyse sought compromise 
formulas: The famous "measures which can contribute to the 
reconciliation of the citizens" mentioned in the governmental 
agreement of the Martens VIII government (1988) and the King's 
speeches of 21 July 1990 and 1 February 1994. 
  Fifty years after the war, the number of people and amount 
of 
suffering involved are no longer unduly large. A report by the 
Flemish Council in 1985 talked about several thousand pensions 
and 1,800 other cases. Such cases range from descendants who 
are still required to pay back debts from 1944 to the Belgian 
state through to civil servants who were refused medals. 
Between 1980 and the end of 1990 the Belgian state gradually 
allowed 96 people who were still making payments because of a 
postwar condemnation to have their punishments reduced. Between 
1975 and 1990, 71 people appealed on the grounds of the law of 
30 June 1961, which allowed the restoration of civil rights. 
Ten applications were actually rejected because those involved 
had been condemned to more than 10 years in prison during the 
repression. 
  It is a new feature that the PS's bureau, which in the past 
received any change in this question with an unswerving no, is 
now ready to "investigate" the social consequences of the 
condemnations after the war. It shows in that in the south of 
this country as well, people are beginning to realize that it is 
necessary to remove the main difficulties presented by this 
question, which always gave tens of thousands of people in 
Flanders a good argument to hate Belgium. It must be hoped that 
this new position will still give something to the last few 
hundred victims of the injustice which took place in 1944 and 
1945. But it is probably a little too late to restore the 
political damage to this unsteady country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Brinkman: Root Out Illegal Entry of </F>
Foreigners"] 
  [Excerpt] The Hague -- During a speech delivered yesterday 
evening in Apeldoorn, L.C. Brinkman, who heads the CDA 
[Christian Democratic Appeal] list of candidates, feels that 
illegal foreigners "must be rooted out." In order to prevent 
illegals from entering the Netherlands, foreigners, as it were, 
must be checked on the ramp to the airplane before it departs 
for the Netherlands, Brinkman said. 
  According to Brinkman, a "precise" asylum policy is needed 
in 
order to prevent Netherlanders from blaming foreigners for all 
their problems. If we are clear about who is rightly here, 
Brinkman said, than nobody has the right to say "You don't 
belong here." 
  The tone of Brinkman's speech elicited criticism from 
coalition partner, the PvdA [Labor Party]. M. van Traa (of the 
PvdA), a member of the Lower House, spoke of "a mistaken use of 
words. You only use the term `root out' in connection with 
weeds. On this subject matter, you must pay close attention to 
your choice of words. Politicians have to understand that." 
According to van Traa, illegality is not to be totally 
discouraged, "unless you want to build a wall around the 
country. You must therefore fight illegality where it causes 
the most trouble, for instance within the context of 
criminality." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Jeroen Trommelen and Erik van Venetie: "Brinkman </F>
Drives Away CDA Voters" -- Intended Top Candidate Scores Badly 
in Polls] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague -- Voters who are not planning to vote 
for the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] in the upcoming 
elections to the Lower Chamber are doing so primarily out of 
dissatisfaction with CDA party leader and intended Prime 
Minister Brinkman. Between one-fourth and one-third of former 
CDA voters find Brinkman an unapproachable figure, or are of the 
opinion that he is not a good successor to Lubbers. 
  This finding, to the detriment, of the CDA emerges from an 
election poll commissioned by DE VOLKSKRANT and carried out by 
the NIPO [National Institute for Polling Public Opinion], in 
conjunction with the University of Amsterdam. According to the 
poll, as things stand at present, the CDA stands to lose 16 
seats in the Lower Chamber. The two-day CDA party election 
conference starts in Rotterdam today. 
  Brinkman's poor standing is apparent from the fact that 
one-fifth of faithful CDA voters regard him as the weak link in 
the party. Twenty-one percent of those asked cited the fact 
that Brinkman is not a good successor to Lubbers as a reason not 
to vote for the CDA. 
  The CDA's supporters rank as the third most dissatisfied 
with 
their party leader: However, the VVD [People's Party for 
Freedom and Democracy] are more unhappy with their leader 
Bolkstein, and the Center Democrats [extreme right-wing party] 
rate their leader, Janmaat, even less. 
  On average, there is even greater dissatisfaction with 
Brinkman among the former CDA voters than among the electorate 
as a whole. Especially older voters (aged 55 and over) cite 
Brinkman decidedly more often as a reason not to vote for the 
CDA. 
  As the intended prime minister, too, Brinkman scores lower 
among CDA voters than some other politicians. For instance, the 
CDA voters have considerably greater confidence in ex-VVD leader 
Wiegel as prime minister than they have in Brinkman. [passage 
omitted] 
  Among the doubting CDA voters, D66 [Democrats 66] top 
candidate Van Mierlo enjoys just as much, if not greater, 
support than Brinkman. Van Mierlo emerges from the poll as the 
party leader commanding the greatest confidence among the 
electorate. His popularity is a major reason for the major 
gains made by the D66. Only Lubbers and Wiegel command greater 
confidence as prime minister than the D66 leader. 
  According to the poll, PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok also 
commands considerably greater confidence as prime minister than 
Brinkman. The newly appointed foreign minister, Van Thijn, 
ranks as virtually neck-and-neck with Kok. The voters judged 
him to be much better than the current number two within the 
PvdA, Secretary of State Wallage. 
  Of all the leading politicians, VVD leader Bolkestein 
commands the least confidence as prime minister among the 
voters. Bolkestein even rates poorly in liberal circles. 
One-fifth of VVD supporters consider Bolkestein as a potential 
reason not to vote for the VVD. Nearly 90 percent of VVD voters 
have confidence in Wiegel as prime minister. In Bolkestein's 
case, this figure is less than 60 percent. 
  The electorate has a rather low opinion of Elco Brinkman. 
Forty-seven percent of all voters consider the adjective "sly" 
to be fitting in describing him. Only 30 percent of them 
consider him to be a "true leader," and only 28 percent claim to 
find him "likable." The CDA voters are slightly less damning. 
Forty-five percent of them consider Brinkman to be "sly," 65 
percent of them regard him as a "true leader," and 57 percent 
claim to find him "likable." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Green Left Congress Making List </F>
`Greener'"] 
  [Text] Arnhem -- Last Saturday [5 February], the Green Left 
electoral congress made three changes to the list of candidates 
for the House of Representatives. Party Chairman M. Vos, who 
was initially on the 17th position, ended up in 5th position. 
This "safe" position is the result of the widely spread 
dissatisfaction among the party members, who felt that the list 
of candidates "was too much leftwing, and not green enough." As 
a biologist, Vos can act as an environmental expert within the 
party group. 
  Former student leader S. van Geest moved from the 15th to 
the 
11th position. This position might gain her a seat, if the 
party gets the 12 seats presently forecast by the polls. Former 
PvdA (Labor Party) Representative P. de Visser moved from the 
30th to the 13th position. He left the PvdA because of his 
criticism on that party's WAO policy (Law on Labor Disability). 
  A conflict between Green Left' various "blood groups" (CPN 
[Netherlands Communist Party], PPR [Radical Political Party] and 
PSP [Pacifist Social Party]), as feared by resigning party group 
Chairman P. Lankhorst and candidate committee Chairman A. van 
Es, was avoided. None of the three new candidates have been 
members of the old parties. 
  As expected, the congress elected the tandem I. Brouwer and 
M. Rabbae at the head of the list of candidates. Rabbae's 
position within the party had been contested, after he had 
stated in an interview with this newspaper, that, as far as he 
was concerned, the book "Satanic Verses" by Salman Rushdie could 
be banned by the judge. He managed to convince his audience in 
Arnhem, that he had changed his mind since the novel had been 
released. "With hindsight, I must acknowledge that I expressed 
myself too vaguely in the interview with NRC," Rabbae said. "To 
be perfectly clear", the former manager of the Dutch Center for 
Foreigners stated that he regards Khomeyni's death sentence as a 
"horrible crime." 
  The tandem P. Rosenmller and L. Sipkes, which lost the 
battle 
for list leadership last year, is on the third and fourth 
positions of the list of candidates. An attempt by some party 
members, including Senator W. de Boer, to relegate Sipkes to the 
ninth position, failed. 
  The reason for this action, was the fact that Sipkes had 
approved the defense budget in the House of Representatives, 
against the congress' will.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CDA Drops to 37 Seats in Opinion </F>
Polls"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] 
is falling from voters' favor. The largest party is at a low 
point with 24 percent of the vote, or 37 seats in the House. 
That is a loss of 17 seats, according to the "political 
barometer" of the Inter-View bureau. 
  The researchers attribute the fall to the fuss surrounding 
the CDA's proposals regarding the Old Age Pension Act. In the 
upcoming term of office, the party wants to put a freeze on all 
benefit payments, including the old age pension. At the last 
poll, taken before this news was known, the CDA could still 
count on 27.1 percent of the voters. 
  The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] in 
particular has benefitted from the CDA's loss. The liberals now 
have 32 seats, an increase of 10. D66 [Democrats 66] also has 
32 seats, an increase of 20. The PvdA [Labor Party] still has 
about 28 seats, a loss of 21. 
  Green Left, which now has six seats in the Lower House, 
would 
appear to have four more. SGP [Political Reformed Party] and 
GPV [Reformed Political Union] remain stable, while the RPF 
[Reformational Political Federation] has climbed from one to 
three. The Center Democrats, who, it was initially thought, 
would get seven seats, are stuck on three seats, an increase of 
two.

<F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Britain's refusal to clarify aspects of the Downing 
Street peace declaration was preventing Sinn Fein from 
completing its examination of the document, party president 
Gerry Adams said tonight. The Irish government's willingness to 
do so underlined the absurdity of the Prime Minister's refusal, 
he claimed. 
  Mr Adams asked: "Why can John Major not follow Albert 
Reynolds' lead on this issue? This would allow Sinn Fein to 
conclude our process of consultation and consideration of the 
document. Without such necessary clarification, it is extremely 
difficult for us. Demands that we do so in the absence of such 
clarity are unreasonable and a cause of suspicion in an already 
difficult climate." 
  Mr Major and Mr Reynolds are due to have talks in London 
next 
week, a week before Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin 
which will be dominated by a debate on the declaration. 
  Mr Adams hinted tonight that there will be no announcement 
on 
a decision whether to accept the December 15 agreement. It 
would be counter-productive to set deadlines because of what he 
claimed was Britain's "obstructionist attitude." 
  The Sinn Fein president said a confidential letter from Mr 
Reynolds, outlining the Republic's interpretation of the 
declaration, would allow a more informed evaluation of the 
document and how it could be developed in an overall peace 
process. 
  The role and influence of the Dublin government was central 
to the peace process, but a lasting peace could not be achieved 
without British cooperation. 
  He added: "The British government should provide 
clarification. The lines of communication are still there to be 
used. It is Mr Major who is refusing to move forward." 
  Mr Adams is to be invited to return to America to head a St 
Patrick's Day parade through San Francisco, it was disclosed 
today. 
  The United Irish Societies, an umbrella group of Irish 
American clubs and organisations, has also invited SDLP leader 
John Hume, Sinn Fein said. 
  And three IRA men who escaped from Ulster's Maze Prison 
would 
act as honorary Grand Marshalls for the March 17 parade.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Cost of Rhetoric"] </F>
  [Text] Following the killing of 68 people by a mortar bomb 
-- presumably Serbian -- in Sarajevo on Saturday [5 February], 
it now seems almost certain that NATO forces will be committed 
to some form of direct military action in Bosnia. Western 
governments, however reluctant to act, now believe they have no 
choice. Before a decision is announced, it is well to consider 
what is at stake. We have always argued against full-blooded 
intervention in the former Yugoslavia: first, because it seemed 
impossible to define attainable military and political 
objectives; and second, because the principal burden and cost 
would fall upon Britain and France, in the absence of the will 
or the means for effective participation by other major powers. 
We have also urged that political leaders should not damage the 
credibility of either NATO or the United Nations by indulging in 
empty threats against the Serbs which they have no intention of 
making good. 
  Yet, in the event, most Western leaders, including President 
Clinton and, some months ago, Mr John Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, 
have succumbed to the temptation to appease public sentiment 
with strong rhetoric. The Serbs have repeatedly called their 
bluff, by ignoring vague threats of international action and 
continuing their brutal assault on Muslim enclaves. Serb 
defiance of Western pressure has indeed been damaging. If, at 
some time in the future, other foreign powers, including Russia, 
feel minded to take aggressive action abroad, why should they 
heed Western warnings to halt or face the consequences? Western 
policy towards Yugoslavia has represented the very negation of 
deterrence. There will often be a good case for 
non-intervention, as we believe that there has been in Bosnia. 
But there is never a case for threatening intervention, then 
failing to make good that threat. 
  And so to the vexed immediate issue, of possible NATO air 
strikes against the Serbs following the hideous events in 
Sarajevo on Saturday. Those most eager for such action are, 
essentially, seeking to use Western firepower to punish the 
Serbs for their actions, rather than in pursuit of a coherent 
long-term strategy. We would argue that it is undesirable to use 
NATO forces merely for punitive purposes. Yet the cost to 
Western credibility could become disastrous if every United 
Nations resolution and NATO threat were to be set at naught. At 
the recent NATO summit, the organisation's political leaders 
committed themselves to offer the UN whatever degree of military 
support was necessary to maintain the UN's humanitarian mission 
and to safeguard the designated UN enclaves in Sarajevo and 
elsewhere. 
  Thus far, nothing whatever has been done to make good those 
promises. Now, it must be. As we argued last week, if the UN's 
humanitarian missions in Bosnia are to continue at all, the 
necessary degree of force must be used to make them viable. 
There is a real risk that forcing open roads and driving back 
Serb artillery by use of ground forces and air strikes will 
escalate the struggle, and embroil UN forces -- including those 
of Britain -- more deeply than ever, and at painful cost in 
casualties. But the alternative, of allowing the world to see 
that the promises of the West's combined political leaderships 
are worthless, is even less acceptable. 
  The West's commitment in the former Yugoslavia should remain 
strictly limited. But such as it is, it should mean what it has 
said. If the presidents and prime ministers of NATO's member 
nations find the Bosnian entanglement intractable and 
embarrassing, it may at least teach them how unforgivable it is 
to indulge in rhetoric in international affairs to placate 
domestic opinion, without the will to act upon it. 
  As a result of such rhetoric, compounded by the awesome 
power 
of television to influence public sentiment towards simplistic 
views of intractable problems, it has now become necessary to 
embark upon a dangerous and possibly foolish course, as the only 
means of maintaining the credibility of the international 
community.

<F P=106> [By Alison Little, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese ambassador to London was warned today by 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd over his reported claims that UK 
firms would suffer in his country because of arguments over 
democratic reforms for Hong Kong. 
  Ma Yuzhen was reported as saying at the weekend that anger 
in 
China over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's plans meant British 
companies' "client relationship" and "public relations" would 
compare unfavourably with that for French, German and American 
firms. 
  Mr Hurd told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee 
that British officials had raised the matter with Mr Ma and that 
his remarks were discussed at yesterday's meeting of EU foreign 
ministers in Brussels. 
  Mr Hurd said he was aware of suggestions to businessmen 
"that 
British interests will suffer as a result of discrimination 
against them in the China market because of the arguments over 
Hong Kong." 
  But he said: "I am not saying he is exceeding his functions, 
but I think British businesmen would be well advised not to take 
his analysis at face value. 
  "That kind of discimination for political reasons is 
something which the EU would have to take very seriously and 
would take very seriously." 
  A spokesman confirmed Mr Ma was called to the Foreign Office 
"within the last week" in response to his statements. 
  David Wright, deputy under-secretary with responsibility for 
Asia, had told him such remarks to British companies in China 
were "unhelpful." 
  Mr Hurd, defending Mr Patten, said: "The Chinese have chosen 
to focus their opposition to some of his proposals -- put 
forward of course with our full knowledge and agreement -- to 
personalise that disagreement on Mr Patten to some extend. 
  "I think that's a pity. I think that gets in the way of 
sorting these matters out as we would wish to do." 
  He said the Chinese were given advance notice of Mr Patten's 
1992 speech in which he first set out his democratic proposals, 
and the UK had stressed it was open for discussion: "Throughout 
we have sought to act by agreement, because it obviously makes 
sense if possible to reach agreement. We continue to seek 
agreement. It has been elusive, but that is not our fault." 
  He stressed it was in China's interests to take over a 
flourishing and confident Hong Kong, and he hoped Beijing's 
appreciation of that fact would prevail and talks could resume. 
  Mr Hurd also told the committee the UK would continue to 
raise human rights issues with China "regardless of events or 
agreements or disagreements in Hong Kong.... There has been no 
soft peddling." 
  But he conceded the UK's progress in tackling human rights 
with Beijing could be "measured in teaspoonfuls...frustratingly 
slow." 
  Asked if China's application to join General Agreement on 
Tarriffs and Trade might be linked to its improving its human 
rights record, he said: "I don't at the moment feel, and the EU 
doesn't feel, that it is in our interests to attach a human 
rights conditionality to China's Gatt application. There are 
quite strong reasons from our point of view for China joining 
the GATT."

"Pergau Arms And Aid Link `Was Agreed'"] 
  [Text] A link between arms sales and aid granted to 
Malaysia for the controversial Pergau Dam project was agreed 
then dropped, the Government disclosed for the first time last 
night. 
  Mr Alastair Goodlad, Foreign Office Minister, said an 
agreement signed in 1988 contained a formula for a set 
percentage of the money spent on British military equipment to 
be reimbursed in aid. 
  In a Commons written question, Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP 
for Swansea West, asked whether the 1988 protocol "contained 
figures relating amounts or percentages of civil aid to amounts 
of arms purchases." 
  Mr Goodlad replied: "Yes." But he added that a letter was 
later sent by Mr George Younger, then Defence Secretary, to say 
aid could not be linked to defence sales. 
  "As a result, the issue was not taken up in the memorandum 
of 
understanding on defence procurement signed in September that 
year," Mr Goodlad explained. 
  However, the answer will bring renewed questions over 
ministerial assurances that no links existed between the aid 
package and arms -- something that could be challenged in law. 
  Mr Major and Mr Hurd, Foreign Secretary, overruled official 
advice to clear the 234 million pound aid, which has been 
described by MPs as a waste of money. Around the same time, a 
1.3 billion pound defence contract was negotiated with Malaysia.

<F P=106> [Report by Philip Johnston: "Tory Euro-Divide Highlighted </F>
by Clarke and Tebbit"] 
  [Text] Tory divisions over Europe were on display again 
last night, threatening efforts to forge a united front ahead of 
June's elections to the European parliament. 
  Lord Tebbit, the former Cabinet Minister, belatedly marked 
the fifth anniversary of Lady Thatcher's Bruges Speech in 
September 1988, with a robust repudiation of closer ties in the 
EC. 
  But Mr Clarke, Chancellor, painted a much more positive 
picture of Britain's future inside what he preferred to call the 
European Union in an address to economists in Paris. 
  Lord Tebbit, whose hostility to the Maastricht Treaty has 
not 
abated -- he equated the measure last night with the retreat 
from Dunkirk -- said he believed the tide of affairs was flowing 
once again in favour of the nation state rather than a grand 
European design. 
  "It is notable that some of the states which mouth the 
slogans of federalism and centralism in accents most exquisitely 
communitaire are now pursuing -- even if it involves cheating 
and breaking the law of the European Community -- policies of 
naked self-interest," he said. "On that basis the day of the 
nation state is far from over." 
  Lord Tebbit, speaking at the Reform Club in London, said 
that 
before Europe could move to economic and monetary union -- the 
precursors of political union -- there would need to be a single 
language, something unacceptable to individual member states. 
  "Until Europe enforces a single language policy, we 
Euro-sceptics know that our views will be proved correct and 
attempts at union will fail," he added. 
  Lord Tebbit also called for overdue reforms of the Common 
Agricultural Policy [CAP]. "It is really time there was a sense 
of outrage against the unmitigated wickedness of the CAP," he 
said. 
  In Paris, Mr Clarke -- speaking in French -- said Britain's 
growth prospects were intimately connected with Europe's and 
linked to the economic aims contained in the Maastricht Treaty. 
  However, he took the opportunity to swipe at moves to force 
Britain to subscribe to social and employment policies that he 
felt would hinder competitiveness. 
  Mr Clarke, a Euro-enthusiast, voiced the concern of senior 
ministers that developments such as the social chapter -- from 
which Britain has opted out -- will play into the hands of the 
freer market economies of the Far East. 
  But his message was essentially one of moving forward, in 
contrast to Lord Tebbit's belief that the existing structure 
would begin to unravel. 
  Mr Clarke said: "As fellow members of the European Union, we 
share a common commitment. We now have to help ensure that the 
Union is pointing in the right direction. It must tackle its 
deep- seated problems of competitiveness, recession and 
unemployment. We can only do that by allowing private 
enterprise and markets to realise more of their potential." 
  The Liberal Democrats launched their campaign for the 
European elections yesterday with a claim to be the only party 
with a positive approach to closer ties in the EC, writes 
Phillip Johnston. 
  Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said: "We are the only party 
that has been consistently and unashamedly pro-European and we 
are proud of our record. Our task is to show that Britain needs 
to take a lead in making Europe work for people." 
  Mr Ashdown called for a common security policy and military 
command for unified action in crises such as Bosnia. 
  The party also wants: 
  Action on jobs via a European recovery programme; 
  Better exploitation of EC regional fund assistance; 
  Stricter Green standards; 
  Gradual steps to one currency; 
  A stronger European parliament. 
  The Liberal Democrats are confident of gaining between three 
and nine MEPs [Members of European Parliament] -- their first.

attackers of Sarajevo by NATO, commissioned by the United 
Nations, the state minister in the Chancellor's office, Bernd 
Schmidbauer, speaking on television on Tuesday [8 February],

strikes as well; the West's own position must back this, not 
verbal gymnastics; we will have to increase pressure on all 
those concerned enormously." In addition, humanitarian aid for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should be stepped up: "The human suffering 
must come to an end." Allegedly, Schmidbauer said on television 
that he agrees with Chancellor Kohl in this matter. 
  But the Chancellor's Office told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that 
Kohl had never made a statement to this effect. Schmidbauer 
expressed his personal opinion. Schmidbauer has clarified this 
in the meantime. His office says Kohl referred to NATO 
decisions and he does not exclude action: "Germany will not 
restrain anybody within NATO taking action at the United 
Nations' wish, but we will give them moral support." Yet, Bonn 
could not take on a role of its own, "because Germany cannot 
participate militarily." 
  Foreign policy experts in the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group seem to 
share Schmidbauer's view, which goes beyond the government's 
cautious comments. The Bundestag group foreign policy 
spokesman, Lamers, said: "After the criminal attack on 
Sarajevo, Germany must take a decision on how long it wants to 
maintain its ambivalent attitude, expressing dismay, but not 
contributing anything to eradicating the root of the evil." The 
international community can only choose between action and 
withdrawal. "While the international community and its 
institutions, which are also ours, lose their credibility, 
exposing themselves to contempt and ridicule, and while the 
killing goes on, the Germans cautiously recommend moderation." 
Lamers went on to say that any German participation must take 
account of the historic burdens. "In concrete terms" Germany's 
action must take a different form, but "legally" it must 
correspond to its partners missions. "Our credibility and 
capability to act are at stake." 
  Lamers called upon the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] "to come to an agreement allowing Germany to participate 
in the necessary actions in former Yugoslavia in a way that 
takes account of the historic burdens." This is the only way 
Germany can influence the partners' decisions and win the right 
to call upon others to act. Lamers said the hope that the 
Federal Constitutional Court would take the decision off 
politicians is a "sign of shrinking from responsibility and of 
inability to make a decision." He said an initiative is required 
"now." 
  The foreign policy spokesman of the SPD Bundestag group, 
Voigt, on the other hand, called on the government to be careful 
with recommending the allies take military action in Bosnia. 
Due to memories of World War II, the Germans could not take 
part in such actions anyway. Air strikes would cause a great 
number of civilian losses. In the event of such attacks, there 
might be demands to liberate Tuzla, which is besieged by the 
Serbs; the town of Vitez, besieged by Muslims; and the old town 
of Mostar, surrounded by the Croats. Voigt recommended a 
precautionary stationing of UN units in Macedonia. Once the 
constitutional questions are clarified, Bundeswehr troops could 
take part in blue helmet missions in Macedonia. 
  SPD defense expert Opel warned of a NATO military strike in 
Bosnia. This would only satisfy "military agitation," he said. 
NATO must not become a "warring party." Former General 
Schmueckle and former Admiral Schmaehling doubt the military 
effects of air strikes. The "Society for Endangered Nations," 
however, advocated air strikes as the only way to end mass 
expulsions and homicide.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "jj": "Sarajevo: The West Must Not Give Up"] </F>
  [Text] If it were not an English term, the Serbs could 
have invented it: brinkmanship, the war of nerves at the brink 
of the abyss. Every time the West has threatened force of arms, 
the Serbs have given in -- of course only as long as the threat 
was hovering over their heads. As soon as it disappeared, the 
concessions and the consideration for the international 
community also disappeared. 
  The first part of this insight also proved true on Wednesday 
[9 February]. While NATO met in Brussels and more and more 
indications of an agreement about an armed ultimatum leaked to 
the public, the Bosnian Serbs and their sponsors in Belgrade 
showed virtual compliance in advance. Already today, Thursday, 
they want to withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo. And 
even more: The cleared Serbian positions and the still 
remaining artillery positions of the FRY Government troops are 
to be put under the supervision of UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force]. In addition, UN troops would take up positions in the 
surroundings to be able to detect the source of potential 
bombardments. 
  Of course, the second part of the old insight will probably 
also prove true: As soon as the international community returns 
to business as usual, the Serbs, too, will resume their old 
goal. The threat of attack must be upheld -- even more: The 
artillery and mortars of the government's troops must also be 
removed. Sarajevo has shed enough blood while the West has 
tolerated the Serbian game. If the West now once again relaxes 
its muscles, the next grenade attack will not be far off.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Abandoning `Megalomania </F>
Reminiscent of Emperor William'"] 
  [Text] Did the candidate for chancellor of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] announce a change at the 
security meeting in Munich -- as the late Herbert Wehner did at 
the Bundestag on 30 June 1960 when he offered the Adenauer 
government the "greatest possible extent of cooperation" in 
foreign policy? In the presence of leading strategists of the 
Western world in Munich, Rudolf Scharping stated that there are 
"no serious differences" in foreign policy between the SPD and 
the Kohl government. 
  Is this a turning point? Scharping told SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG: "It was no turning point. I only wanted to clarify 
what the resolutions of our party congresses really mean. On 
this basis, an SPD government would be fully capable of action 
in foreign policy. Its program covers everything the United 
Nations did in the past few years -- and what it will want and 
be able to do in the future." In other words, this means that 
the SPD would be able to support the peace missions in which the 
multination association in New York might ask the SPD to 
participate. This would not be more than "blue helmets plus" -- 
that is, "monitoring of peace," "blockades" like those in the 
Adriatic, "humanitarian missions" like the one in Bosnia and 
Somalia, and the military protection of such tasks. 
  What will happen if the United Nations wants more? The 
candidate believes that the United Nations is no world 
government that can order the states to march. Every government 
must make its own decisions. Still, Erwin Horn, a longtime 
member of the Defense Committee and an SPD member, believes that 
Scharping adopted a "different and new tone" at the Munich 
conference. As the "classical party of internationalism," the 
SPD cannot "simply stand aside forever." Scharping has realized 
that. Horn added: "We must abandon the megalomania reminiscent 
of Emperor William, that we always want to be different from the 
others." 
  Yet the "changes" hinted by the party chairman have 
certainly 
also been triggered by expected major decisions by the 
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, which have already cast their 
shadow at this point. Karsten Voigt, foreign policy spokesman 
of the Bundestag group, put it this way: "It is to be expected 
that Karlsruhe will declare the full spectrum of UN measures as 
legally possible. The Constitutional Court has signaled to all 
three parties that it will basically settle all pending issues 
in a positive way in the early summer: The purely humanitarian 
mission in Somalia, participation in the blockade in the 
Adriatic Sea (an operation initiated by the Western European 
Union), and the AWACS mission over Bosnia (NATO mission on 
behalf of the United Nations, that includes a combat 
operation)." Thus, an amendment to the constitution will not be 
required but only parliamentary approval with a simple majority. 
  Scharping could live very well with such a ruling, and he 
could even go further than the party has allowed him so far. 
Both the blockade in the Adriatic Sea against the Serbs and the 
flights of the NATO fire control system (AWACS) are basically 
combat missions of which the leftists in the party do not 
approve. One of Scharping's foreign-policy aides stated: "If 
this is the way Karlsruhe will decide, resistance within the SPD 
will collapse. This is the return to a tradition that accords 
great significance to a clear orientation toward the West in its 
foreign policy," he added. 
  What is even more, the party's doctrinarian wing would be 
silenced for the time being in the mammoth election year 1994, 
and the candidate could fully concentrate on his bid for power. 
In addition, no one in the West would have to be afraid of an 
election victory of the SPD for foreign policy reasons, as Horst 
Teltschik, Kohl's former security adviser, stated ironically at 
the security conference in Munich. 
  A victory of the "Atlantic-minded" -- of those who both 
reject the special European relationship with France and 
unilateral measures vis-a-vis the East -- is emerging within the 
SPD. In fact, the new harmony between the SPD and the United 
States no longer requires special efforts. The United States no 
longer insists on a choice between nuclear rearmament and 
special detente vis-a-vis Moscow and East Berlin. The entire 
West is now united in the difficult balancing act to integrate 
and contain Russian power. Affection is easy to give if it does 
not require a price.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Excerpts] FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU writes: The deadly 
grenade on the black [as heard] market of Sarajevo marked the 
end of the time of hypocrisy. Either the UN withdraws the blue 
helmets and lifts the arms embargo to make the Bosnians' 
legitimate self-defense easier, and leaves Bosnia to its fate, 
or the UN -- represented by NATO -- wages war against the Serbs 
and Croats. An ultimatum for pacifying Sarajevo, addressed to 
the Serbs, is, in the worst case -- and one has to proceed from 
that premise -- just an overture of a war with ground forces. 
However, who would be willing to wage such a war, in view of 
the probable heavy losses, a confrontation with Russia, and 
without any obvious prospect of a time when a sensible, feasible 
policy will once again replace the war? FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU 
asks. 
  STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN, too, is skeptical: The NATO 
ultimatum will give new hope to the desperate, often 
disappointed people in Sarajevo. However, what political effect 
can air strikes have? Are they more than a late sign of 
collective, helpless outrage? Bombs against resignation, 
because a solution to end the bloodshed continues to be elusive? 
And surely anyone who wants to break the siege around Sarajevo 
for any length of time necessarily needs the will to drag those 
ruined villages out of the claws of violence, those villages 
that lie off the track of international attention and cannot 
hope for a worldwide outcry against the atrocities? This was 
STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN. 
  MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG is also critical: Cease-fires for 
Sarajevo -- how many have there been? Yet again hope arises for 
the inhabitants of the Bosnian capital -- a hope that may be 
deceptive. No one will guarantee that the Bosnian Serbs really 
want to take a first, serious step toward negotiations by 
loosening the siege around the city. There is too much that 
indicates that this announcement is just another attempt to lull 
the outraged world public. In particular since only NATO's 
threat of military force has given rise to some movement among 
the parties to the conflict in the Balkans, doubts about the 
seriousness of the plans for withdrawal are more than 
appropriate, MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG stresses. [passage omitted] 
  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, discussing Russia's resistance to 
attacks on Serbian positions, notes: Even though there has 
never been any doubt about the solidarity of the Eastern 
Orthodox Slavs with the Orthodox Serbs, now Moscow for the first 
time has threatened quite clearly to veto air strikes on the 
Serbian besiegers of Sarajevo. The fact that the accusation 
against UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, which was made at the 
same time, namely that he has exceeded his authority, happened 
to coincide with the NATO deliberations about a potential 
ultimatum addressed to the aggressors on the Balkan battlefield 
was no coincidence, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE notes.

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Schmitt: "More Problems for the </F>
Bundesbank"] 
  [Text] Trade in foreign exchange is insecure. After the 
United States increased interests, the dollar abruptly jumped up 
three pfennigs. Since then, however, it has remained at 1.76 
German marks [DM]. Once more, rumors are spreading that the 
Bundesbank intervened in the market to slow down the rise of the 
dollar. There was no indication of it in the past few days but 
even the possibility seems to somewhat restrain the market. 
<H5>  Further Upswing for Dollar Likely </H5>
  The Bundesbank is probably happy with this reaction. The 
protectors of our mark want to force short-term interests 
further down, and a major devaluation of the German mark 
vis-a-vis the most important currency in the world would not fit 
into this concept. Nevertheless, the Central Bank Council will 
probably have to put up with another revaluation of the dollar. 
The U.S. economy is simply growing too vigorously at the 
moment. Moreover, the chance for higher U.S. interests will 
lure money from Germany across the Atlantic. Dollar rates of 
DM1.80-1.85 this year have become more likely. 
  A strong dollar does not prevent a further loosening of 
monetary policy in Germany, and thus in most countries in West 
Europe. Yet it is certainly an obstacle. For the Bundesbank it 
will become more difficult to find the right moment for the next 
small step. The decisive factor will be how quickly the dollar 
is now revalued. A rapid increase in leaps would be dangerous, 
as this process might easily get out of hand. If, however, the 
markets are prepared and the dollar moves within narrow margins, 
then the next interest cut might be less dramatic. 
  Thus, it was a wise decision for the Bundesbank to advertise 
the next securities repurchase agreement, again at a fixed 
interest of 6 percent. This calms down the market, gives the 
German mark some respite, and once more proves the Bundesbank's 
commitment to stability. Since 2 December, the rate for money 
market transactions has been constant, and the discount rate has 
been stable since 21 October. 
  Since last Thursday there has been no news regarding the 
third key rate; individual participants in the market speculated 
with an interest tender. This procedure would have given banks 
the chance to force down the pension rate through their tender 
behavior. Yet, the Bundesbank obviously did not want to give a 
signal for lower prime rates shortly after interests went up in 
the United States. 
  The other side of this policy is that the longer the Central 
Bank Council waits, the more pressure on it will increase -- at 
home, in case the domestic economy does not rebound, and in 
terms of foreign policy through the partner countries that want 
to get out of the recession with cheap money. France, Belgium, 
and Denmark in particular, tied their prime rates so quickly 
again to the German level that they cannot do anything without 
the Bundesbank. Solo actions like those of spring 1993 are not 
possible this time. The members of the European Monetary System 
[EMS] learned their lesson from last July's crisis, that the 
markets punish a lack of stability awareness through devaluation. 
  Although the dilemma of the Bundesbank is understood, hope 
in 
neighboring countries for further interest cuts remains almost 
undisturbed. The reason for it is invariably seen by market 
participants in the poor economy and high unemployment in almost 
all European Union [EU] countries. Evidence that the change in 
U.S. interests is not applicable to Europe was supplied by two 
EU members earlier this week. On Monday, Belgium defied the 
turbulences on the financial markets and cut its monetary market 
interests, albeit only by narrow margin. 
<H5>  EMS Members Are Waiting for Action in Frankfurt </H5>
  On Tuesday [8 February] the Bank of England followed with a 
slight reduction of its basic lending rate. Politicians are 
waiting, and the markets speculate with further steps by the 
central banks -- in Britain as well as almost everywhere else in 
West Europe. In the EMS, Italy, Spain, and Portugal may still 
have some room to maneuver for an independent policy. Everybody 
else must hope for action in Frankfurt.

<F P=106> [Report signed "fy": "New Speculations About Bundeswehr"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 9 Feb -- On Wednesday the Defense Ministry 
said that a report stating that the Bundeswehr will "probably be 
reduced to about 300,000 men" over the next few years is "pure 
speculation." The DPA correspondent had reported that he had 
learned this in the Slovak capital of Bratislava, where Defense 
Minister Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) is currently 
visiting the Slovak Army. Through lack of money the Bundeswehr 
can reportedly by no means be kept at the level of 370,000 men; 
it must be reduced to about 200,000 army soldiers, about 80,000 
air force soldiers, and 20,000 navy members. 
  Since at the security conference in Munich on the weekend 
Ruehe had also announced a reduction of the Bundeswehr and 
cutbacks in Bundeswehr planning, in terms of both structure and 
bases, this DPA report was received with considerable attention 
by government circles. Reportedly, the future of the Bundeswehr 
will soon be the topic of a talk between the chancellor and his 
defense minister. In Munich Kohl had stated that the size of 
the Bundeswehr will be somewhere close to 370,000 men.

<F P=106> [Interview with Inspector General Klaus Naumann by Michael </F>
J. Inacker in Hamburg; date not given: "Naumann: Budget Cuts 
Endanger Operational Readiness of Troops"] 
  [Text] [Inacker] In spring 1993 you stated that the 
"patient Bundeswehr" could handle another operation, but there 
must be an end to the financial cuts. Now another 1.25 billion 
German marks [DM] have to be saved. How many more "operations" 
can the armed forces really take on? 
  [Naumann] What I described as an operation at the time was 
an attempt to make clear that we need planning security to be 
able to shape the structures of the Bundeswehr in the second 
half of this decade in accordance with its tasks. Thus, the 
operation refers to what the minister announced as conceptual 
considerations for April. 
  What we are now doing is carrying out more cuts that will 
lead to parts of the Bundeswehr being unable to achieve the 
degree of operational readiness that its mandate demands. This 
will also reduce the scope for action in German policy, because 
we will have to accept a temporary reduction concerning the 
operational readiness of the main defense forces. In addition, 
there will be delays in the restructuring of the Bundeswehr 
because it will probably not be possible before the end of this 
decade to provide a minimum contingent of crisis reaction forces. 
  [Inacker] As Germany's most senior soldier, can you take 
responsibility for these cuts -- both regarding the troops and 
regarding the politicians who expect the armed forces to be 
ready for operations? 
  [Naumann] I am telling the politicians in very plain terms 
what the Bundeswehr is no longer able to achieve. It is clear 
that we will not be able to cut expenditure by DM1.25 billion 
without major consequences, all the more so because the budget 
debate was characterized by the understanding that "further 
reductions to the Bundeswehr are no longer possible." 
  What is often overlooked is that there is a correlation 
between mandate, structure, strength, equipment, training, 
operations, and finances. One can compare the situation with a 
system of communicating tubes. One cannot reduce the level in 
one tube and expect the level to remain the same in the others. 
  [Inacker] What options of German security policy can no 
longer be ensured? 
  [Naumann] The defense policy is oriented toward a country's 
interests and its international obligations. My task as 
military adviser of the defense minister and the Federal 
Government is to determine what we can and what we cannot 
achieve. We are currently in the middle of this evaluation 
process. 
  My first conclusion is that we will no longer be able to 
achieve the current standard of operational readiness for many 
troops in 1994/95. Thus, we will lose options for German 
defense policy, and we will certainly not be able to correct 
that again overnight. There is no leeway within the defense 
budget, which, however would be necessary to complete the 
adaptation of the Bundeswehr to new and much broader tasks by 
the end of the decade. 
  What makes the situation even worse is that opportunities to 
seek solutions together with our alliance partners in the spirit 
of task sharing cannot be taken as long as we do not know 
whether we will participate in operations such as the AWACS 
mission over Bosnia. 
  The fact, for example, that, in a battalion of four 
companies, we will not be able to fill a quarter of one company 
because of the lack of soldiers reduces the operational 
readiness of the battalion for a year. This means that we need 
time or would have to call up reservists if this battalion were 
needed. 
  At the moment, such a partly filled battalion is not 
required 
for Germany's defense. Thus, these cutbacks are acceptable this 
year. Yet this situation must change, and guidelines concerning 
the development of the Bundeswehr in the second half of this 
decade must be issued. 
  [Inacker] Is it possible to provide the army with modern 
equipment on the basis of the investment funds available? How do 
you assess the loss of national defense capacities resulting 
from the austerity measures? 
  [Naumann] I am clearly worried about our national defense 
capacities. We must preserve defense capacities in some areas. 
However, we must do that where this is possible from a 
technological viewpoint or where we have a lead, because this is 
also a criterion for our capacity for international cooperation 
and participation in systems. 
  At an investment share of approximately 21 percent in the 
defense budget, it is not possible to maintain the innovative 
capacity of the Bundeswehr in the long run. Ultimately, this is 
the central planning problem that we have to resolve to prevent 
increased procurement after the year 2000. Thus, the investment 
share must be increased. Examinations concerning 
rationalization have been initiated to this end. 
  [Inacker] You repeatedly referred to the new type of 
combat-ready and fighting soldier at the commanders' meeting. 
Is the required training possible with the funds available? 
  [Naumann] If one views training in terms of immediate and 
fast operational readiness for all the troops of the Bundeswehr, 
this cannot be achieved with the funds available. Thus, one 
must consider carefully what training one demands for what kind 
of troops. Different training is required for the main defense 
forces and crisis reaction forces. This has nothing to do with 
the stupid talk about a "two-class army." The task of the main 
defense forces is relatively one-dimensional, aimed at the 
country's defense. In this respect, it has to be taken into 
consideration to a greater extent that there is a certain leeway 
that can be utilized for mobilization if a decision is made at 
an early stage of a crisis. The crisis reaction forces, however, 
have to be trained for rapid and immediate operations in unknown 
geographic areas and unknown scenarios. This has an impact on 
the training level. A great deal of imagination will be 
required to work out the details of this differentiation within 
the Bundeswehr. As far as troops are concerned, this means: We 
do not necessarily have to say that training is no longer 
practicable if we can no longer do everything that was 
considered mandatory in the past.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "From the Party Program: </F>
Environmental Policy"] 
  [Text] Worldwide environmental destruction has meanwhile 
reached a scope that might endanger mankind's survival. The 
destruction of the natural bases of life, however, also destroys 
the future of coming generations and thus any hope. In the 
interest of the continued existence of mankind and of our 
people, the global and regional protection of the environment in 
order to ensure the preconditions for existence is an 
outstanding international and national task. 
  Even though Germany, as an industrial state, is one of the 
world's technically most highly developed countries and 
certainly has the necessary means, it is still engaged in 
environmental cosmetics instead of environmental policy. The 
degree of industrialization and the high density of the 
population produce growing tension with the justified and 
necessary ecological demands. 
  The preservation of an environment that is worth living in 
for the coming generations of our people is, however, more 
important for us Republikaner than a short-sighted striving for 
profit and prosperity. The German people's bases of life can, 
however, be ensured only if the population density does not 
increase further. Therefore, one must put an end to the further 
immigration of foreigners to Germany. 
  Successful environmental policy can be implemented only 
together with a sensible population policy! 
  We Republikaner demand: 
  -- Anchoring the protection of the German people's bases of 
life as a priority task in the Basic Law, in a way that leads to 
actionable claims for damages and claims to compel someone to 
refrain from doing something in case of environmental damage, in 
line with the polluter-pays principle. 
  -- Legal definition of the common welfare mentioned in 
Article 14 of the Basic Law in the sense of safeguarding our 
people's bases of life in the long term. 
  Short-term national economic interest must no longer justify 
environmentally harmful interference in private property! 
Environmentally conscious behavior must already begin in 
childhood and is to be included more intensively in school 
curricula. 
  Air, soil, water, fauna, and flora form a densely interlaced 
network. In addition to pollution from the air, this network is 
seriously affected by waste disposal and by emissions from 
households, traffic, industry, and agriculture. Immediate 
measures, including legislative, are necessary to protect it. 
  Therefore, we Republikaner demand: 

  -  Industry and 
consumers are to be stimulated to act more economically. 
  -  The 
minimum life expectancy of industrial goods and the recycling of 
used raw materials are to be increased drastically. 
  -  The legally 
permitted introduction of partly untreated industrial waste 
water into waters of all kinds is to be rescinded. 
  -  In 
agriculture, the area-related introduction of nitrogen must not 
be higher than the consumption of nitrogen so as to protect the 
ground water. Therefore, strictly area-related husbandry and 
tax incentives for using mineral fertilizers less generously are 
to be implemented without any further delay. 
  -  The use of 
agricultural chemicals is to be reduced further in a similar 
manner. They are an essential reason for the dying of species. 
Under the precondition that this is safeguarded effectively by 
means of foreign trade, it would also be possible for the 
farmers to receive higher prices for their products again while 
yield per hectare would be lower all over the country. 
  -  Not least 
because of the unbraked mass immigration, one needs more and 
more living space and usable space. Construction projects are 
to take into consideration more intensively the concerns of 
soil, water, and landscape protection. The transformation of 
arable land into areas for roads or housing construction is to 
be limited to the unavoidable minimum. 
  -  In case of industrial and 
public building projects, natural areas must be created in 
compensation. 
  -  Surface waters are to be increasingly fed into the 
ground water. 
  -  The ground water strata are to be preserved in 
construction projects. 
  Environmental offenses are no minor offenses! We 
Republikaner therefore demand the strict punishment of 
environmental criminals.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber: "The </F>
Morally Decayed Republic"] 
  [Text] How confusing and torn apart is the country in 
which we are living. On the one hand, a large part of the media 
is defending a man like Herbert Wehner, who -- to be quite frank 
-- was a communist henchman. Because of his denunciations, he 
bears part of the blame for the killing of some of his former 
friends in Moscow by a shot in the neck. 
  On the other hand, the same media absolutely condemn a man 
such as Hans Filbinger, who was quite certainly not a very 
agreeable fellow, either, because he signed death sentences in 
his capacity as a judge. One can surmise that he thought he had 
the law on his side. 
  As a man who consciously experienced dictatorship as a young 
person, I can fully understand that the fear for their own lives 
goaded some people to regard their own salvation as more 
important than that of their friends. Very few are suited to 
become heroes in the shadow of the gallows. Still, those who 
failed the test should no longer be permitted to play a role on 
the political stage. 
<H5>  If You Beat My Wehner, I'll Beat Your Strauss </H5>
  Had Wehner been a conservative, he would have been 
immediately dropped by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU] as soon as the file on him became public. 
Yet, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] remains 
faithful to this denouncer, even after his death. And the 
CDU/CSU is acting remarkably moderately -- why? Is it afraid of 
a possible tit-for-tat? If you beat my Wehner, I'll beat your 
Strauss. Even though one cannot compare the behavior of the two 
late leading politicians, one is more and more tempted to 
suspect that Strauss was involved in treacherous activities. If 
somebody allowed a Stasi officer and arms dealer such as 
Schalck-Golodkowski access to ones Federal Intelligence Service 
[BND] files, he, at least, indirectly, favored the enemies of 
the FRG. 
  After all these revelations, ill-feeling among the sinners 
of 
this country is rising. Are living leading German politicians 
bribable, some from Washington, others from Moscow? Rumors are 
sprouting. Is maybe even Genscher the man behind IM-Tulpe 
[informal agent Tulpe]? I refuse to believe it. Stasi agents 
may still even be sitting in the BND itself. 
  We have long had Italian-like conditions. The Italian 
politicians have the Mafia on their neck, while in the case of 
ours, it is the Stasi and also the Mafia, that is extending its 
network across Europe. 
  One gets ahead quite nicely again in this country wearing 
"red socks." The perpetrators triumph, the victims despair. 
  The reasons for this nightmare are deeply rooted. They reach 
far into the past. 
<H5>  Walk Upright! </H5>
  In the FRG there has not been any honest discussion of 
Nazism, in the new laender none of communism. Facts were 
dismissed in western Germany, facts are being dismissed in 
eastern Germany. The young people watch it and are ashamed of 
their fathers. Initially, the daughters and sons of Stasi -- 
and other communist -- officials saw their upright fathers only 
in long underpants, while now they see them stark naked in their 
moral shabbiness and whininess. 
  After 1945, quite a few daughters and sons of high-ranking 
Nazi officials turned to the left in disgust -- one only has to 
look at the family backgrounds of the generation of 1968 -- 
while in the former GDR [German Democratic Republic], young 
people are now falling from one extreme into the other following 
ultras wrongly being described as right-wing. 
  It is the task of our party to offer these young people -- 
particularly in the new laender -- a political home in a 
democratic constitutional party such as ours. Let us sum up: 
Large parts of the Nazi and Communist generation of fathers has 
failed in the face of history. They shunned discussion with 
their children. They were hiding behind the argument of having 
had to protect their existence. 
  We are facing up to the necessary debate -- but not 
cap-in-hand. The exodus from Babylonian Captivity begins. We 
Republikaner are marching at the forefront and are setting the 
trend. And no Schnoor, no Birzele, no Uhrlau, including their 
auxiliary forces in the media, can stop us!

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Manhunt With Video Films"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- German left-wing extremists are 
now using secretly made video films against their potential 
terrorism victims. The "black films" were produced, as the 
extremists claim themselves, at a high cost, and show "persons, 
structures, and meeting places" of political opponents, that is, 
of right-wing extremists or suspected right-wing extremists. As 
of now, it should be possible to "take them to task at any time, 
be it in their favorite restaurants or in their apartments," a 
paper of the Antifascist Action says, which the Federal Office 
for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] considers as 
belonging to autonomous groups from the Rhine-Main area who are 
ready to use violence. 
  The filmed "wanted posters" are accompanied by a topical 
militant brochure, giving details such as names, photographs, 
and addresses of the "militant fascists." In the area of 
Aschaffenburg, 23 "targets" are listed, in Frankfurt 14, in 
Hanau 7, and in Mainz 5. In addition, the lists also contain the 
car license plates of the "target persons," who must "be stood 
up to wherever they are." 
  One of the persons listed has been the target of left-wing 
extremist violence several times. After an attempted arson 
attack on his car, the perpetrators justified their attack as 
follows: "There are enough reasons to put a stop to the plans of 
such swine as.... We will get them all. Antifascist resistance 
must not peter out with slogans and limit itself to pure 
symbolism." 
  Acts of violence by the autonomous groups are not limited to 
the Rhine-Main area. In Berlin, too, people have been called to 
participate in "Volxsport" [distortion of "Volkssport," which 
means "popular sport"], which is a synonym often used in the 
milieu to mean attacks. "Wanted posters" were also printed by 
the Hannover paper RAZZ "to serve as a basis for all antifascist 
forces who have recognized the necessity of directly combating 
and politically isolating neofascism." 
  In the view of the BfV, a new wave of violence in Germany's 
extremist scene threatens because of the mutual publication of 
"political hit lists" -- at the end of last year the neo-Nazi 
brochure EINBLICK published the names of "anti-German and 
antinationalist forces." 
  The so-called Revolutionary Cells are also involved in that. 
In a position paper, their women's group -- Red Zora -- has now 
committed itself for the first time again after a five-year 
break to continuing the "armed struggle." The "destruction of 
installations, buildings, and objects" is an "important, 
indispensable part of revolutionary women's policy," the 38-page 
brochure says. In a "practical handbook" the activists inform 
the reader about, among other things, the handling of 
explosives, the building of incendiary charges, and the forging 
of documents. Whoever does not seriously decide in favor of 
militant actions and armed struggle, Red Zora admonishes, does 
not recognize the dimension of the opponent and of the apparatus 
of power. Thus, the terrorists recommend, for instance, 
"punitive actions" against rapists' lawyers. 
  According to the BfV, more than 28,000 persons in Germany 
belong to left-wing extremist organizations and groups. 
Autonomous groups that are ready for violence and that have 
more than 5,000 followers, register a steady influx of new 
members. The mobilization potential amounts to a further 
several thousand persons.

<F P=106> [Interview with former PDS Chairman Gregor Gysi, by Axel </F>
Vornbaeumen, in Berlin; date not given: "`We Are Annoying, 
Because We Remind People of the GDR'"] 
  [Text] Does the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] 
have a chance even in the old federal laender in the super 
election year? Gregor Gysi, top thinker of the PDS, is convinced 
that his party has a role in all of Germany. FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE correspondent Axel Vornhaeumen spoke with Gysi in 
Berlin. 
  [Vornbaeumen] Mr. Gysi, are you secretly grateful to people 
like Bavaria's Interior Minister Beckstein for wanting to ban 
the PDS? 
  [Gysi] No, for one simple reason. It intimidates members and 
sympathizers of the PDS. And it diminishes the inhibitions of 
our real political enemies, the perpetrators of violence on the 
extreme Right, to take action against us. They sense a kind of 
legitimation for acts of violence. 
  [Vornbaeumen] But it has given you a great many advocates, 
even in the camp of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. And 
people are talking about the PDS. 
  [Gysi] The latter is right. This gives us a media public 
that 
we seldom have. But the disadvantages clearly outweigh the 
advantages. There are two other things to consider: it could, on 
the one hand, be a preparation for an old story in the FRG, 
namely an occupational ban. And it could also inhibit people who 
actually have the idea of voting for the PDS, as though they 
were doing something almost illegal. I think that in the event 
of an investigation it would turn out that the PDS stands very 
much on constitutional grounds and certainly more so than the 
CSU [Christian Social Union] in decisive matters. Above all it 
poisons the political climate. 
  [Vornbaeumen] Give your enemies a tip: Where would they have 
the greatest chances of proving your unconstitutionality? 
  [Gysi] I do not think that there is much chance of that 
unless one takes the statements of individual members. But in 
this way I can demonstrate the unconstitutionality of every 
party in this FRG. I still assert that the statement by Bavarian 
Minister President Stoiber, in which he warned against a 
"racially mixed society" in the FRG is clearly unconstitutional, 
because it is incompatible with Article 1 of the constitution as 
well as with the principles on equality of people before the law 
regardless of what nation or race they belong to. And it is 
quite astounding how the CSU gets around this. I can only say 
that a person could not remain a member of the PDS with a 
statement like this. 
  [Vornbaeumen] What do you think about the classification of 
the CSU land group chief Glos: "the radical leftist PDS and the 
Greens are a greater danger to our country than the Republikaner 
and the radical rightists." 
  [Gysi] That is an interesting quote. In the first place, he 
thereby says that the Republikaner are not radical rightists. He 
sees them to the right of the Republikaner and he can only take 
them to be the DVU [German People's Union] and extreme rightist 
splitter groups such as the NL [National List] and others. And 
if he thinks that Alliance 90/Greens and the PDS are even more 
dangerous than these extreme rightist groups, then that says 
something about where he stands. That is a dangerous statement 
that shows a total loss of a sense of reality. 
  [Vornbaeumen] Is a sharper wind blowing at the beginning of 
the "super election year," because one was not--or no 
longer--taking the PDS seriously and is suddenly startled by the 
latest election successes? 
  [Gysi] I have noticed that the tone toward the PDS has 
changed completely since 6 December 1993. Many were alarmed by 
the good election result in Brandenburg and now some established 
political forces are trying artificially to restore the 
atmosphere of 1990 with respect to the PDS. Something quite 
remarkable is happening: in large newspapers, including your 
own, the talk was primarily of the "PDS" alone. They ceased to 
point out that it is the successor party of the SED [Socialist 
Unity Party of Germany]. And since 6 December all the newspapers 
have again been pointing this out in every report. I am 
interested in how something like that works. 
  [Vornbaeumen] What, in your opinion, is the effect of the 
label "successor party"? 
  [Gysi] Two things: in the first place, that people are 
afraid 
to deal with our political statements and declare this 
unnecessary. The SED is known and hence there is no need to deal 
further with the PDS, with what it is doing, what it is saying, 
and with what it wants. The other thing is that it is certainly 
a negative label. Of course it is true that we came out of the 
SED. That cannot be denied. Still, I think that one ought to try 
to understand the changes. They avoid that through a label. 
Besides, it is also offensive to the voters. They are thereby 
saying that over 21 percent of the voters in Brandenburg really 
voted for the old SED. I do not believe that. 
  [Vornbaeumen] Is not too much fuss being made about a party 
that has not been able, despite the greatest effort, to campaign 
for the Bundestag with prominent names on an "open list"? 
  [Gysi] What do you mean, am I not prominent? 
  [Vornbaeumen] You are but there is hardly anyone else. 
  [Gysi] Let us wait and see, the question is what prominent 
means. We may have different ideas about this. So far we have 
not published a list of names. It has just been dealt with in 
the media and that is a trick too: they raise expectations very 
high and then they can turn the results into a defeat.... 
  [Vornbaeumen] ...or they keep names like Stefan Heym, for 
example, in play and hence the name of the party. 
  [Gysi] Yes, that is not bad but that is really not our 
initiative. Heretofore I have not cited the name of Heym. 
  [Vornbaeumen] Also a prominent person in the east. 
  [Gysi] The PDS did come out of the GDR. Since the entire GDR 
is not supposed to have been, the fight against the PDS is also 
a fight against the memories of the GDR and against GDR-identity 
in general. In the view of established politicians and in the 
view of journalists, we are simply a disruptive factor merely 
because we are still reminding people of this history, even 
though it is not so intoxicating. But we do not deny it, whereas 
all the other parties that existed in the GDR have come to an 
understanding with their sister parties in the west to treat 
their history in the GDR as though it never happened. 
  [Vornbaeumen] So you are seeking your candidates primarily 
in 
the east? 
  [Gysi] Our goal is still to be a party for all of Germany. 
But at the same time we will not deny our origins in the east. 
Naturally the east Germans still need a specific representation 
of interests, because unification has caused great problems and 
because there is a humiliation of east Germans and 
discrimination in all areas: from the woman receiving social 
assistance to the entrepreneur in eastern Germany. Only the PDS 
can articulate this effectively, because it is the only party 
that is not continually forced to heed its clientel in the west. 
But that can only be an option of our policy. We are also a 
leftist party and we have developed leftist positions--and they 
are not east German. 
  [Vornbaeumen] The problem of the PDS is that at this time 
one 
can make a lot of headway with "eastalgia." 
  [Gysi] This is not our fault. We have not promised any 
blooming landscapes. It was not our doing that the deals reached 
in the east are not being recognized. It is not our doing that 
almost all of them almost everywhere are being subjected to 
revision and many are now worried about their property and 
dwellings. And now the established parties are reproaching the 
people for finding access to us because we have always 
criticized that. 
  [Vornbaeumen] So much for the east. In the west, however, 
the 
PDS is a foreign party. 
  [Gysi] I also underestimated the real division in Germany. I 
assumed that we are a leftist German party that can be accepted 
with respect to its leftist position in western Germany as well 
despite the burden of its past. I underestimated the fact that 
for the western Germans we are for the present a foreign party. 
Quite well-meaning western German students have always treated 
me a little like the chairman of an Indian party. At the same 
time, the main difference is not between east and west. It is in 
part artificial in nature. The decisive thing is still the 
difference between rich and poor, between those on top and those 
on the bottom. And the gap is widening. There are still some in 
established politics who are interested in artificially 
maintaining this east-west opposition to obscure the other 
social contradictions. 
  [Vornbaeumen] Vote-getting in the west is probably your 
role. 
Otherwise you would not have withdrawn as party chairman. What 
has your resignation done for the party? 
  [Gysi] Several things. The party does indeed exist, even if 
I 
am not chairman. That is something that used to be disputed. 
There are considerably more personalities in the PDS than was 
supposed. Who knew Mr. Kutzmutz just two months ago? We have 
become more effective in the Bundestag. I can visit meetings in 
the west more often. We have improved our profile in the west, 
in part through other questions than in the east. An example: 
when I consider our voter potential in the east, I know that 
many vote for us despite our position on the right of asylum and 
not because of it. Those who vote for us in the west probably do 
so on account of our position on the right of asylum. 
  [Vornbaeumen] Is that a split that one can live with very 
well? 
  [Gysi] One can live with it, because I would never say 
anything else. In the west, our pronounced social, antimilitary, 
and other leftist positions are yielding an increase in 
acceptance. And not all of that is east German. That justifies 
our claim to be a democratic party for all of Germany to the 
left of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. I too know 
that that is difficult. Nevertheless, I think that we have a 
potential of 2 percent of the voters in the west. 
  [Vornbaeumen] For you is the result for Rolf Kutzmutz in 
Potsdam the starting signal that there is an acceptance for 
former members of the SED in the east? 
  [Gysi] We simply must see that the SED was never a 
homogeneous institution. If a Mielke were to be elected, that 
would really scare me--along with Mr. Glos. But I consider this 
out of the question. The entire revolution would not have 
happened without the critical part of the SED. 
  [Vornbaeumen] But it does block access to the solidary 
society of the leftists. The Left in the west really does not 
want it. 
  [Gysi] I am not sure. Some in the SPD, for example, do like 
us. The leftists in the parliamentary group of the SPD always 
argued: postal reform, right of asylum, Bischofferode--Do you 
want to leave this theme to the PDS as well? We will be quite 
pleased to be misused for this. 
  [Vornbaeumen] Under the motto: the GDR made the FRG "more 
social." These are your words. Is there an analogy PDS-SPD? 
  [Gysi] It is a similar effect. It gives another chance to 
the 
leftists in the SPD. Sometime the leftists in the SPD must draw 
the conclusion that in recent decades they have not been able to 
prevail in a single question. If at all, they were sometimes 
able to prolong a process but they could never stop it. Up until 
the 1970's, it was typical for the FRG that the Left at least 
determined the questions. Since the 1980's, at the latest since 
unification, it was the conservatives who determined the 
questions in Germany: right of asylum, eavesdropping 
offensive--those are all their themes. 
  [Vornbaeumen] You have a nice field for action there. 
  [Gysi] Unfortunately we cannot do it. We must not 
overestimate ourselves. At the moment only the SPD could set 
real social-policy themes from another view than that of the 
conservatives. But it is not doing it. So it needs pressure, 
including from us.

  [Text] Concerning the NATO ultimatum to Bosnia, France 
played a leadership role. It succeeded in getting the United 
States, and finally all the NATO members, to follow in its wake. 
This morning Alain Juppe, the French minister of foreign 
affairs, repeated that it is essential to find a diplomatic 
solution to the matter. But most of all he repeated France's 
determination. Here he is: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] We are told that there has been a 
cease-fire agreement, and an agreement to withdraw heavy 
weapons. Fine. Let it be implemented in 10 days' time. If it 
is implemented 10 days from now, there won't be any problem. 
But there must be a signed agreement. An umpteenth cease-fire 
is not enough. 
  If we really want to stop the carnage, a cease-fire is not 
enough. The weapons which could at some time make it possible 
to start again have to be withdrawn. 
  France, which has the biggest contingent on the ground -- 
2,000 troops in Sarajevo -- was the one who made the proposal. 
This means we have faced up to our responsibilities, not 
without much deep thought, not without taking every possible 
precaution, of course, to bring together our men and to protect 
them as much as possible, but fully realizing that no protection 
plan can be 100 percent effective in such a situation, as 
Francois Leotard said here with me last Sunday. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Column by General Pierre Gallois: "About `Air Strikes'"] </F>
  [Text] The politicians, the media, and the general public 
-- all those who are justly upset by the events in Yugoslavia -- 
view the so-called "air strikes" as the way to end, if not the 
war, then at least the siege of Sarajevo. When "use of force" 
is considered, or even advocated, one does not mean military 
operations on the ground -- which would be too hazardous -- but 
the use of air power. However, before one resigns oneself to 
such an idea, one needs to know the nature of the targets to be 
destroyed and the way air power could be used to achieve such a 
goal. 
  What are the targets? Contrary to a common misconception, 
these are not batteries of artillery operated by gunners, as 
commonly believed, but mortars fired by infantrymen. A mortar 
is a tube whose inside is smooth, not rifled, a kind of 
stovepipe fitted on a tripod or a light carriage. One 120-mm 
mortar type weighs less than 100 kilograms and three men can 
easily carry it around, as well as its projectiles (each of 
which weighs 19 kilograms). It is an inaccurate weapon designed 
for indiscriminate destruction within a given area. When Mr. 
Kouchner [former humanitarian action minister] states that the 
Markale marketplace was a "deliberate and easy target when one 
knows the place," he shows that he has never seen a mortar, much 
less seen one in operation. One cannot hope to hit a 
30-by-40-meter wide target with any degree of accuracy using a 
mortar from a distance of 5 or 6 kilometers. To ensure a good 
probability that such a target will be hit, tens, or even 
hundreds of shells would be needed -- not a single one. So what 
we are dealing with is an inaccurate weapon which is all the 
more difficult to locate since it takes up very little space, 
possibly less than two cubic meters. However, using infrared 
equipment, a mortar could be spotted when it is firing, provided 
a suitably equipped aircraft has been continuously monitoring 
the area where the mortars have been operating. This would 
afford better accuracy than an anti-artillery radar. The U.S. 
Air Force has planes that are specially equipped for such tasks 
-- Lockheed C-130's -- but these are not deployed over Sarajevo. 
  Now for ways of attacking the mortars. As a matter of form, 
let us begin with a procedure which has been frequently 
mentioned: the use of cruise missiles such as the American 
Tomahawk. To be sure, the advantage of such weapons is that 
their operators remain safe at all times. However, they are 
only effective against fixed targets. Preparing the operation 
takes time, especially if the machine's navigation is to be 
based on terrain features. Since mortars are easily moved, 
chances are that, after being located at the moment of firing, 
they would be removed from the spot at which the cruise missiles 
would be directed. 
  Would warplanes be more effective? Would American F-117 A's 
[assault] and aircraft carrying the French AS-30 air-to-ground 
missile fit the bill? In Iraq, against fixed targets, they were 
highly successful. But against mobile mortars, they could fail. 
And there is no guarantee that from a distance of 15 to 20 
kilometers the crew of such aircraft would be able to point its 
laser beam on a very small target easily concealed by a few 
shrubs. Furthermore, on being notified of the air attack, the 
mortar operators would immediately move their weapons. Another 
possible intervention procedure is low-altitude assault using 
30-mm guns or missiles. Locating a hidden mortar at speeds of 
400 to 500 kilometers per hour would require several passes at 
very low altitudes which would put the planes and their crews at 
considerable risk. The U.S. Air Force high command is well 
aware of this and does not intend to tarnish its successes 
achieved in the Gulf War by losing a few aircraft to the Serb 
Army's light anti-aircraft weapons or (soviet-made) 
ground-to-air missiles. 
  Thus the misgivings of the soldiers -- who happen to know 
their job -- are motivated by reasons which the politicians do 
not understand or pretend not to understand in order to remain 
attuned with public opinion. It would be better to inform the 
latter instead of continually blurting out threats that are not 
taken seriously because they cannot be implemented due to 
technical and moral factors.

<F P=106> [Article by Pascal Virot: "Paris -- New Consensus Over Armed </F>
Intervention"] 
  [Text] After months of dithering, an agreement seems to be 
emerging. With the exception of the French Communist Party 
(PCF) and the National Front (FN), all parties now favor a 
military intervention. 
  To the question "to fire or to withdraw?" asked on 6 January 
1994 by French Ambassador [to Sri Lanka] Christian Lambert, 
French political circles are today almost unanimous in 
answering: "to fire." In other words, to put an end to the 
Bosnian slaughter through a military intervention consisting of 
air raids. This change of mind took sometimes a long time to 
materialize both on the right and on the left. Just as was the 
case for the Gulf War. Today, however, a consensus is in the 
works between the main political forces. 
  Laurent Fabius had been the first one to call for armed 
intervention against the Serbs. "Bombing Serbian military 
targets is perfectly feasible," the then First Secretary of the 
Socialist Party stated in 1992. Such a declaration, at a time 
when France was fully committed to a humanitarian policy, had 
met with outright rejection. 
  The humanitarian option, a policy which Jacques Chirac had 
likened at the time to a "poor stopgap," was long the French 
government's alpha and omega. Former Humanitarian Action 
Minister Bernard Kouchner, who personified this policy, has now 
largely changed his stance. While he used to profess his 
powerlessness ("how do you prevent people from fighting when 
they want to fight?", he asked after a trip to former 
Yugoslavia), Bernard Kouchner is now asking: "What are we 
waiting for?" And when Foreign Minister Alain Juppe suggests 
that the Serbs should be issued an ultimatum, Bernard Kouchner 
says that he can only "approve, provided this ultimatum is more 
than just the latest one in a continuing series." 
  The Socialist Party's position has been clearly defined by 
its leader, Michel Rocard, who said on Tuesday that the siege of 
Sarajevo must be "urgently" lifted and that "a real cease-fire 
must be imposed, by force if need be." Earlier this year, 
Michel Rocard and Bernard Kouchner had signed a joint appeal for 
an "imposed cease-fire." Today, Michel Rocard can only 
reiterate his support to French diplomacy's current approach, 
hoping that he will "be impressed by the results of Alain 
Juppe's determination." 
  Jean-Pierre Chevenement has also changed his mind. While at 
the beginning of the year he demanded that diplomats seek a 
"political settlement" to the conflict, it now seems that the 
president of the Citizens' Movement does not oppose an 
intervention any more. "Today, we must intervene and say why," 
he said. He added that what is needed is "setting a political 
goal and then using all available means, not only air power." 
  Leading majority persons have also changed tack. RPR [Rally 
for the Republic] President and Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac 
quickly let it be known that he favored a military intervention, 
but warned that more delays were likely to make it more and more 
problematic, or even "impossible." More recently, he took a 
tougher stand: "We must withdraw and then hit them," he said 
last month. At any rate, the French plan, which includes 
issuing an ultimatum to the belligerents, has been well received 
by the RPR, which views it as "the only possible solution" to 
the conflict. 
  Pierre Lellouche -- Jacques Chirac's diplomatic advisor -- 
even advocated a broader stand from France, while acknowledging 
that it would be a "risky procedure." Otherwise, he said, 
France ought to "purely and simply get out" of Bosnia -- that 
is, to withdraw its blue helmets. Interior Minister Charles 
Pasqua concurred yesterday on France Inter [radio network]: 
"The time has come for everyone to face up to their 
responsibilities. Either NATO finally decides to intervene, or 
I do not see what we are staying in Bosnia for. The only thing 
left for us to do is to go." As for [former president of the 
republic] Valery Giscard d'Estaing, he called for "an immediate 
air strike against the batteries of artillery which fired on 
Sarajevo's marketplace." 
  It was probably Cher representative Jean-Francois Deniau who 
best defined the potential impact of both the conflict and the 
French position. He had been the first to call for armed 
intervention to counter Serb progress at the very beginning of 
the war, and he was also able to explain that such an 
intervention would become more problematic the longer it was 
postponed. Indeed, in his opinion, the option between "to fire 
or to withdraw" is nonexistent: To withdraw would mean to evade 
our responsibilities, while a military option would require 
changing the UN mandate. In all cases, Jean-Francois Deniau 
implies that it is too late, unless "we go back to square one." 
His priority would be for Europe to focus "on a few clear 
objectives, even limited ones, with real means." 
  Last, as was the case during the Gulf War, only the 
Communist 
Party and the National Front remained opposed to intervention in 
Bosnia. PCF National Secretary Robert Hue flatly rejected the 
notion of a military solution to the conflict, which, according 
to him, could only lead to a "military escalation." "What we 
need to prepare is peace, not battle plans," he stated, 
demanding that a real embargo on weapons be restored. The 
Communists have been calling for a demonstration to take place 
today in order to "put an end to the war." As for [NF leader] 
Jean-Marie Le Pen, he said he opposed any presence of French 
soldiers in the former Yugoslavia, where, he said, the 
government had got involved "out of vainglory."

<F P=106> [Philippe Marcovici editorial] </F>
  [Text] Perhaps.... Perhaps the 68 victims of the 
indiscriminate shell that crashed into a Sarajevo market on 
Saturday [5 February] did not die in vain. France, at least, 
has done everything in its power to ensure that this bloody 
absurdity does not happen again. 
  By threatening to withdraw its UN troops from Bosnia, Paris 
has literally backed NATO up against the wall. NATO cannot 
withdraw any further and the Americans, who are its spearhead 
and its main strength, have had to stop hesitating and humming 
and hawing in order to come into line with the "French fury" 
suddenly revealed by Alain Juppe on TV Tuesday evening. The 
foreign minister has taken up the harsh saying used by French 
soldiers in Sarajevo: "Either we shoot or we get out." After 
warning our allies on Monday and Tuesday, neither the United 
States nor NATO could agree to let the French "get out," since 
people are not exactly lining up to take over. 
  Alain Juppe, who was personally shocked by Saturday's 
massacre, has certainly been sensitive to the indignation of 
public opinion, which itself has been shocked by the unbearable 
images shown on TV. This is a public opinion that clearly no 
longer understands how the safety of the UN troops in Sarajevo 
can serve as an excuse for a policy of non-intervention. 
  By bringing pressure to bear on the allies, the French 
foreign minister, in total agreement with the French president 
and prime minister, is aware of the risks being run -- both 
those run by the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] soldiers in 
Bosnia, and the risk that both the attempt or any action may 
result in a failure. That is what is called a calculated risk, 
and even if mentioning such a risk might seem uncalled-for in 
the tragic context of Bosnia, the French Government should 
benefit politically from it. 
  This is all the more true since, for the time being, French 
firmness seems to be bearing its first fruits: both in 
Brussels, where the NATO Council ambassadors met yesterday, and 
on the ground, where Serbs and Muslims yesterday signed an 
agreement on the withdrawal of Serb heavy weapons to keep them 
out of reach of Sarajevo and the placing of Muslim heavy weapons 
under supervision. Of course, this agreement -- which in itself 
is merely the application of UN Security Council resolution 820 
passed on 18 April 1993, must be considered with the utmost 
caution. So many others that have preceded it have gone 
unheeded! All we can do is hope that this time reason will win 
the day and make it possible to curb the dangerous escalation 
represented by the destruction of these weapons with air 
strikes. This would be merely adding more war to the war. 
  Yet, the very mention of reason in Bosnia is already an 
aberration, given the madness that was unleashed there almost 
two years ago now.

<F P=106> [Franz-Olivier Giesbert editorial: "War or Peace"] </F>
  [Text] We must never despair of those who govern us. And 
yet, with regard to Bosnia, they have done everything. They 
have feigned humanitarian anger and engaged in the flights of 
fancy of an armchair colonel. Not forgetting, of course, to be 
photographed in Sarajevo -- the scene of all the crimes. 
  All the governments, from Left to Right, from Washington to 
Paris, and including London, are as bad as each other. All were 
guilty of the same negligence. And in a few days, France has 
managed to change the situation. It has been immediately 
followed by the United States. Together, they have proposed to 
their NATO partners that they give the Serbs between 7 and 10 
days to withdraw their artillery to a radius of 20 km around 
Sarajevo. Failing which, the West will carry out air strikes. 
  It is all perfectly clear. Of course, one would have wished 
that this determination had been displayed earlier. It would 
have spared many human lives in Bosnia. The West is arriving 
late, but it is arriving. Moreover, this is thanks to France. 
Although it has old habits in the sphere of passive diplomacy, 
it is sometimes capable of going into action. That is what 
happened last Sunday following the massacre at the Sarajevo 
market, when Foreign Minister Alain Juppe forcefully asked NATO 
to send an ultimatum to the Serbs. 
  Until then the Western countries had hypocritically passed 
the Bosnian buck among them. At regular intervals, the United 
States turned accusingly toward Europe. And the reverse was 
true. If one could do nothing it was because of the other's 
impotence. The two then agreed to point the finger at their new 
scapegoat -- the United Nations -- although they were its 
guardians. Their caution and duplicity eventually became 
criminal. 
  The months went by and then the years. And the shells 
continued to fall on the civilian populations, as on Gravelotte 
[scene of battle in Franco-Prussian War 1870-1871]. Each time 
the pressure mounted in the international sphere, the 
Machiavellian Serbs took a step backward and the West returned 
to its concerns. Yesterday, during the NATO meeting, they 
repeated the same farce. By concluding with the Bosnians an 
"immediate cease-fire" agreement in Sarajevo, and by accepting 
the principle of the withdrawal of heavy weapons which will be 
placed under the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. 
  For the first time in a long time, therefore, it is France 
which has led the field. Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Balladur were 
on the same wavelength, the foreign minister was able to 
convince some people, intimidate others, establish alliances, 
and above all form a bloc with the United States. The 
international community could no longer sit back and watch the 
Bosnian tragedy while 28,000 Blue Helmets -- potential hostages 
-- were intended to intervene between the warring sides. Nobody 
yet knows how the story will end: Mr. Juppe in particular and 
our country in general will at least have made some attempt. 
  It is often by preparing for war that you make peace....

<F P=106> [Article by Patrick-Henry Desaubliaux: "5,793 French Blue </F>
Helmets in Former Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] On 1 February, France's military participation in 
the UN Protection force [UNPROFOR] was 5,793 blue helmets out of 
a total of 27,540. On the same date, there were 4,077 French 
blue helmets in Bosnia out of a total of 10,760. 
  The French blue helmets make up several battalions: 
  -- The 1st Infantry Battalion, stationed in Glina, some 150 
kilometers south of Zagreb; it comprises 890 men equipped with 
front-line armored vehicles (VAB) and light armored vehicles 
(VBL). Their weapons include about 12 antitank Milan missiles 
and as many 80-mm mortars. 
  This battalion consists of units of the 27th Mountain 
Division (Grenoble): Annecy's 27th BCA [mountain light infantry 
battalion], Grenoble's 27th RCS [expansion unknown], Grenoble's 
7th BCA, La Valbonne's 7th BGDA [expansion unknown], Chambery's 
13th BCA, and Briancon's 159th RIA [mountain infantry regiment]. 
  -- The 2d and 4th Infantry Battalions are stationed in 
Sarajevo. 
  The 2d Battalion has 769 men equipped with VAB's, Milan 
missiles, and 80-mm mortars. The VAB's are fitted with 12.5-mm 
machine guns. The battalion was formed with units belonging to 
the 9th Marine Infantry Division (Nantes): Angouleme's 1st RIMA 
[marine regiment], Auvours' 2d RIMA (near Le Mans), Angers' 6th 
RG [engineer regiment] and Vannes' RICM [expansion unknown]. 
  The 4th Battalion is comprised of 812 men also belonging to 
the 9th DIMA [marine division]. In addition to weapons similar 
to those of the 2d Battalion, they have 12 wheeled armored 
Sagaie ERC's [reconnaissance vehicles] equipped with a 90-mm 
cannon. They come from the 3d RIMA and the RICM (Vannes) as 
well as Angers' 6th RG. 
  -- The Zagreb-based logistical support battalion is 
comprised 
of 1,140 men mostly belonging to Chalon-sur-Marne's 10th command 
and support regiment. 
  -- The Bihac-based 3d Infantry Battalion comprises 1,275 
men. 
  It is equipped with VAB's, VBL's, Milan missiles, and 80-mm 
missiles as well as very-short-range SATCP's [very short-range 
surface-to-air missile], and 12 Sagaie armored vehicles. 
  This battalion was formed with units from the 15th Infantry 
Division (Limoges): Clermont-Ferrand's 92nd RI, Brives' 126th 
RI, Castel Sarrasin's 31st RG, and Sathonay's 99th RI. Also 
present are elements from Valence's 1st Spahi corps. 
  -- The Kakanj-based Battalion of Engineers has 400 men from 
Besancon's 19th RG, Mourmelon's 72nd RG, and Angers' 7th RG. In 
addition to its own specialized vehicles, it is equipped with 
VAB's. 
  Apart from the 24 Sagaies, these units have no heavy 
weaponry 
(neither armored vehicles nor artillery). Each battalion has a 
relatively small number of Milan missiles and 80-mm mortars. 
Not all VAB's are equipped with 12.5-mm machine guns. Personal 
weapons are FAMAS [Saint Etienne assault rifles] and a small 
number of FRF1 precision rifles. 
  This choice of weapons was not made by France but by the 
United Nations. Initially, when the blue helmets have begun 
their mission in the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations had 
resisted the presence of the VAB's, which it deemed "too 
offensive." These wheeled vehicles offer good protection from 
bullets as well as mines. Without them, there would have been 
more casualties than currently recorded: 18 dead and 281 
wounded. In addition to these 5,793 blue helmets, France has 
1,200 and 3,000 men stationed nearby the war zones: The crews 
of the ships patrolling the Adriatic, European observers, air 
surveillance units monitoring the embargo and helicopter 
detachments based in Split.

  [Text] Strasbourg, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Two hundred crosses and 
tombstones symbolising the 200,000 people killed in the Bosnian 
conflict were planted Wednesday [9 February] on the lawns in 
front of the European Parliament building here. 
  About 1,200 people gathered in silence in front of the 
building to protest against ethnic cleansing, while some also 
called for military intervention in the conflict. 
  The crosses and tombstones were due to be removed during the 
night, despite protestors' hopes that they would be left in 
place for a few days as a reminder that all the green spaces in 
Sarajevo have been turned into cemeteries. 
  The organisers from a Strasbourg-based group say they intend 
to mount similar protests "until peace returns to Bosnia".

<F P=106> [Eric Zemmour report: "European Elections -- The Single </F>
List? Matter Closed in the Republican Party"] 
  [Text] The Republican Party [PR], which held a National 
Council meeting at the Mutualite yesterday, demanded the 
formation of a single majority list for the coming European 
elections. A list headed by Jean-Francois Deniau. 
  This is the story of a National Council meeting which came 
too late. Or too soon. Too late, because the PR leaders -- 
Gerard Longuet and Philippe Vasseur -- had set this cumbersome 
mechanism in motion to prevent the formation of an autonomous 
UDF [Union for French Democracy] list headed by Giscard 
d'Estaing at the UDF National Council meeting scheduled for 19 
February. However, since then, the former president of the 
republic has given up this idea and his remaining supporters in 
the UDF seem to accept the principle of a single majority list 
in the forthcoming European elections. 
  But this PR National Council meeting also came too soon: The 
party cadres meeting in Paris were thinking more of the cantonal 
elections next March; Giscard and Chirac will not meet until 
tomorrow; and it is not yet known whether Edouard Balladur will 
still be strong enough in two months' time to impose a single 
list on the RPR [Rally for the Republic]; and if either will 
still want it. 
  This inopportune timetable produced a National Council 
meeting without an issue, without a debate, and without 
interest. For instance, the PR had launched a wide-ranging 
consultation of its members on the European program which was 
intended to be "exemplary," but which, despite thousands of 
amendments sent in for weeks, ended in a unanimous show of 
hands. Similarly, the deliberately "blue, white, and red" final 
text tries to answer the opposing objectives of "the new 
frontier" to the East, so dear to Philippe Seguin, and that of 
the single currency shared by four or five countries proposed by 
Maastricht's supporters, and urges a stronger Community 
protection but at the same time a move to put the Brussels 
Commission in its place. 
  Finally, the question of the single list raised virtually no 
problem. Of course, Charles Million once again -- without 
saying it explicitly -- argued enthusiastically for the 
formation of two RPR and UDF lists: "The European debate 
concerns us, because it cannot be stifled by tactics or by 
resignation or reduced to mutual concessions on a minimum 
program.... Europe is worth a debate. Let us not lock 
ourselves into a petty political game." 
<H5>  Tactical Choices </H5>
  But the debate on the debate did not take place. Giscard's 
supporters know that the fate of the two lists is in the hands 
of the RPR alone and its tactical choices in its struggle 
against Balladur. In these conditions, the ministers had no 
difficulty in imposing a single list, with the simplistic tone 
so dear to the advertisements advocating the privatization of 
Elf: "Who can doubt that we would defend our interests better 
if we are separated, when we have a single government, and a 
single majority?" Francois Leotard seems to be asking. 
"France's voice must be heard strongly in the Strasbourg 
Assembly," Gerard Longuet said without even a hint of doubt. 
"The French public and especially the European public must be 
presented with a union list expressing the solidarity and 
strength of our majority." 
<H5>  Opinion Poll Wars </H5>
  The matter was therefore settled. In advance. The party 
cadres, who will need the RPR's votes in next March's canton 
elections, had to heed this message of unity. Having triumphed 
without fighting on the essential issue, the PR leadership could 
make some concessions to the Giscard clan. First, the pledge by 
all members on the list to take their seats in Strasbourg. That 
rules out [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe as head of the list. 
And at the same time it settles the quarrels on precedence 
within the RPR with Philippe Seguin. Furthermore, the assurance 
that all the future French elected representatives will join the 
same group -- the PPE [European People's Party] -- to help form 
the "liberal Europe" so dear to Alain Madelin. 
  That only left the question of who would head the list. It 
is know that the PR is pushing Jean-Francois Deniau, and the CDS 
[Social Democratic Center] Dominique Baudis. For several days, 
the opinion poll war has been raging, each having its own, 
naturally favorable to its candidate. But the PR, which proudly 
proclaims that it is the "second party in France," after the 
RPR, has an undoubted numerical superiority, in members and 
deputies, over the centrist party. And it intends to use it. 
That is why the PR made do yesterday, through Gerard Longuet, 
with referring the choice of candidate to the "confederation's 
competent bodies." 
  Gerard Longuet does not want to violate the UDF, he simply 
wants to dominate it, for instance to be president of it in 1995 
when Giscard no longer is. Meanwhile, he is showing his 
strength. He is asking the UDF to choose Deniau at a political 
office meeting or at its next National Council meeting on 19 
February. Or later. It does not really matter when, the 
important thing is to be as strong as possible with a view to 
the big bargaining session which will preceed or follow the 1995 
presidential election.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "From Gibraltar to Svalbard"] </F>
  [Text] Relations in the European fishing sector are turning 
sour and the serious crisis which has been racking France in a 
context comparable to last winter's illustrates the failings of 
a European Union structure which -- treaties, regulations, and 
summits notwithstanding -- is more interested in lofty 
principles than in the daily life of men. Fishing is one of the 
sectors which are being shaken up by the globalization of trade. 
But unlike cereals, fishing was virtually ignored by our GATT 
negotiators. 
  For the last 10 years, especially since Spain -- whose 
fishing fleet is Europe's largest -- joined the Common Market, 
fishing has mostly been dealt with from Brussels rather than 
Paris, Copenhagen, or Madrid. The European Commission proposes 
and enforces orientation prices for major species; it organizes 
market support; it ensures that structural adjustment aid 
packages do not turn into operating subsidies; it sets the exact 
size of fishing nets; it comes up with the idea of monitoring 
fishing boats via satellites; and it sets the quantities of fish 
each country is allowed to catch. 
  Above all, commissioners are in charge of negotiating trade 
treaties with maritime countries such as Argentina or Russia 
and, in exchange for an authorization for European trawlers to 
operate in their waters, the products of such countries are 
granted preferential access in Europe. Since customs duties 
never exceed 18 percent (2 percent for salmon), they never 
really amount to a deterrent likely to bring tangible meaning to 
the principle of Community preference. 
  Even within Europe, there is a strong bone of contention 
between countries with a substantial fishing industry (France, 
Spain) and Northern countries (united around Denmark, Britain, 
and the Netherlands). The latter have powerful fish processing 
industries and purchase mostly low-priced fish outside the 
European Union. Their commercial interests are opposed to those 
of the Paris-Madrid axis. 
  This is why the requests which France regularly submits to 
the EU in the hope of obtaining guaranteed prices or a 
protective clause are greeted with caution by its partners, 
which fear that any interventionism, even temporary, will work 
counter to the free-trade philosophy. 
  Nevertheless, the "European fishing community" needs to 
become stronger. Indeed, what is at stake in the negotiations 
with Scandinavian countries -- and especially Norway, whose 
well-managed waters remain well-stocked with fish -- is nothing 
short of crucial in the field of fishing. What a gain should 
Community waters extend as far as the Svalbard archipelago! But 
what will Britanny's David do when he has to face Scandinavia's 
Goliath?

  [Text] Paris, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Opposition socialist leader 
Michel Rocard would lose hands down in French presidential 
elections against either of the two main rightwing contenders, 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Gaullist leader Jacques 
Chirac, an opinion poll said Thursday [10 February]. 
  In the second round of presidential elections, which are due 
in May, 1995, Rocard would score 42 percent against 58 percent 
for Balladur, said the Louis Harris poll for the weekly VALEURS 
ACTUELLES. But Rocard improved his score by four points on a 
similar poll carried out a month ago while Balladur lost four 
points. 
  If the contest was with Chirac, Rocard would win 44 percent 
of the vote against 56 percent for Chirac, the poll said. The 
figures were identical to last month's.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Louis Levet, head of the General </F>
Planning Commission's Technological and Industrial Development 
Department, by Henri Loizeau; place and date not given: 
"Strategic Information, Key to Corporate Competitiveness"] 
  [Text] The General Planning Commission has published a 
report on "economic intelligence." The working group, chaired 
by Henri Martre, argues that there is an urgent need for the 
French protagonists to wake up to this. 
  [Loizeau] What is the reason for this report on such a 
little known concept as economic intelligence? 
  [Levet] For several years now, the Planning Commission has 
been developing lateral and interministerial thinking. When I 
started work in the Planning Commission almost two years ago, I 
wanted to develop this kind of thinking in the sphere of 
industry, following the Mayer report on "information and 
competitiveness." The sovereignty of states depends increasingly 
on the mastery of technologies and a strong and competitive 
industry. With this in mind, strategic information represents 
one of the levers determining an economy's worldwide 
performance, which in turn combines competitiveness and social 
cohesion, as is shown by the example of Germany and Japan. 
Similarly, the Clinton Administration is trying to remedy the 
American economy's loss of competitiveness by a strategy of 
economic security serving employment and based on the 
strengthening of the industrial fabric and a response to attacks 
from competitors. 
  [Loizeau] How can "economic intelligence" be defined? 
  [Levet] The working group chaired by Henri Martre defined it 
through the following three functions: Mastery of the 
scientific and technological heritage; the detection of threats 
and potential opportunities; and the formation of a strategy of 
influence serving the national interest and/or the enterprise's 
interest. Thus, strategic information management becomes a 
fully valid tool in the permanent understanding of the market 
situation, the technologies and thinking of competitors, their 
culture, their intentions, and their abilities to implement 
them. It must serve a dynamic and concerted strategy. 
  [Loizeau] Which countries are most advanced in this sphere? 
  [Levet] The two systems which perform best are Japan and 
Germany. In Japan, the information system is collective, 
focused on the world market, and serving national independence. 
In Germany, it is the motor of the national economy, based on 
industrial strength. In the United States, however, the economic 
intelligence system seems fragmented, based on an 
individualistic rationale by the enterprises. 
  [Loizeau] And in France? 
  [Levet] In France there is no economic intelligence system 
based on a common goal. Historically, the state and the public 
enterprises have played a driving role. In the enterprises, the 
eighties saw the emergence of technological and competitive 
monitoring. But it is not yet really seen as a strategic tool. 
The main goal of this report is to help speed up the awareness 
which is beginning to emerge in this sphere. 
  [Loizeau] What are the recommendations which you are putting 
forward to ensure that France is not left behind in this crucial 
sphere of information. 
  [Levet] We are drawing up a series of proposals based on 
four guidelines: 
  1. Introducing the practice of economic intelligence 
gathering in the enterprise by the direct involvement of general 
management, the creation of a position of economic intelligence 
network manager, and the motivation of the whole staff. 
  2. Encouraging the flow of information between government 
departments and enterprises. In this area, the state must play 
a strong encouraging role. 
  3. Designing databases tailored to user requirements, for 
instance, by launching a national program for the production of 
databases with a strategic content and mobilizing the necessary 
expertise. 
  4. Mobilizing the world of education and training by 
creating specialized training programs in economic 
intelligence....

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the reason for 
the shuttle diplomacy being carried out by Gustave Feissel, the 
deputy special envoy in Cyprus of the UN secretary general, is 
to determine the priority of the issues to be discussed during 
the actual negotiations. 
  Denktas held a one-hour meeting with Gustave Feissel today. 
In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that they 
exchanged views on how to determine the priority of the issues 
to be discussed during the actual negotiations. The aim of this 
exercise, Denktas said, is to find out?how the package will 
affect the Turkish Cypriot community, what its advantages are, 
and whether the benefits promised by the United Nations and by 
the UN experts are real. 
  The president pointed out that if the answers to these 
questions are positive and satisfactory, then the package of the 
confidence-building measures can be implemented. He added that 
he considers it useful to discuss these issues. 
  Denktas announced that he will meet with Feissel again on 
Friday [11 February], and that the talks planned for 15 February 
will be held on 17 February because of the postponed Greek 
Cypriot National Council meeting. 
  Feissel, in turn, said that they held a beneficial meeting 
with President Denktas, adding that they are working on the 
agenda and issues of the talks planned to begin next week. 
Replying to a question, Feissel said that the 
confidence-building measures package is being regarded as a 
whole.

<F P=106> [Giacomo Bonessa report: "Occhetto: `League Comrades: </F>
Turn to Me'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] These are the details of the 
prestigious game that PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
economist Visco has played. 
  Decentralize Tax Yields -- Taxes will not be decided and 
collected by the government only. Half of them will end up in 
Rome and the other half will be set and administered by the 
regions and the municipalities, which until now do not have any 
responsibility. The local authorities will thus have to be 
directly responsible for the services rendered to the citizens 
in proportion to the taxes raised. This project will be easy to 
realize because it already exists in federal states like the 
United States, Canada, Germany, and Switzerland. 
  End to the Fiscal Jungle -- The system of the thousand heavy 
taxes which obsesses taxpayers will be drastically simplified. 
Local income tax, ICIAP [local tax for professionals], health 
tax, various health contributions, regional surtaxes. The tax 
system will also be simplified because a shopkeeper should not 
be required to carry out the same bureaucratic tasks as a large 
company. The financial administration will be called to 
undertake a major effort to hit evaders with maximum severity, 
but also to provide reimbursements in time. 
  Less Tax for Everyone -- Our companies are the most heavily 
taxed in Western Europe. The tax rate will be reduced from 52.3 
to 40 percent. Receipts can be maintained at the same level by 
simply doing away with the laws which favor tax dodging and 
removing provisions for special categories and reductions like 
the one which [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi had made to 
measure in order not to pay tax on assets allocated to TV from 
1985 to 1990. There is also a need to untax social security 
contributions and reduce indirect burdens for all those 
activities (like many craft activities) where the income is 
below the average. Another need is for incentives for companies 
to take on registered unemployed persons or workers looking for 
their first jobs. 
  Taxes on Treasury Certificates and Wealth Worth -- These are 
categorically excluded, even if the tax on government securities 
and bonds will be standardized at 12.50 percent. The hard line 
of the Communist Renewal which insists on a "wealth tax" will be 
softened. 
  Taxes on Shares -- This is the magician's trick which has 
backfired. Visco assures people that there will not be a 
worsening in relations with the stock exchange, but at the same 
time he states that he will shift the tax burden from the 
companies to the companies' owners, that is, onto the 
shareholders. 
  In short a program which, on paper, can please the worker as 
much as [industrialist] Agnelli. And indeed the day before 
yesterday, Mandrake-Occhetto came out triumphant from his 
meeting with the Assolombarda [Industrial Association of 
Lombardy] industrialists: "We have passed the exam," he 
announced in a conference. It is a pity that the economy is not 
just a conjuror's illusion.

Bordon by Marco Marozzi in Riccione; date not given: "Dialogue 
Reopens Between Alliance And Democratic Party of the Left -- AD 
Insists on `Guarantees on Electoral Lists'"] 
  [Text] [Marozzi] So everything has resolved itself in the 
progressive front? 
  [Bordon] Hold on a moment. While the situation appeared 
tense for a couple of days, I would wait before assuming that we 
have found a solution. The Greens' assembly appeared to me to 
be very good and Fabio Mussi's speech also seemed very good. 
However, I do not think that all the problems have been 
resolved and we cannot take our merger for granted on Tuesday [8 
February] at the plenary session of the progressive table. 
[Bordon stops] 
  Willer Bordon wants to get a few final details straightened 
out. The Democratic Alliance's national coordinator had only 
just come out of the cooperative climate of the convention in 
Riccione and declared that he was "satisfied" but made it clear 
that: "Nonetheless, for us there remain two vital issues cannot 
be conceded and to which definitive answers have yet to be 
found. Firstly, at the elections we want to put forward the name 
of the prime minister or a list of candidates who could lead the 
future progressive government. The second point concerns the 
composition of the electoral lists. 
  [Marozzi] Will you continue to support [Prime Minister] 
Ciampi's candidacy for prime minister? The Greens do not like 
him and neither does Communist Renewal. 
  [Bordon] We have expressed our preference but we are not 
going to stick fanatically to just one person. A group of 
candidates could put themselves forward to be prime minister 
before the election. However, it is important that we explain 
to the voters on what points we oppose the moderates. We must 
make it clear before the electorate goes to the polls. For 
example, Francesco Rutelli came here today. It is true that he 
is the only Green mayor of a large city [Rome] but it is equally 
true that Communist Renewal is in the opposition in Rome. 
Things like this must not occur. 
  [Marozzi] What do you not like about the composition of the 
electoral lists? Mussi seems to have shown prompt readiness. 
  [Bordon] That is true, but now we must check what he has 
said. There is a risk now of a nasty party division. That is 
another gift that we cannot present to the moderates.

  [Text] After the initial fervor, the former DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] members who moved into the right-wing camp are 
now discovering that finding their place between the [Northern] 
League, Forza Italia, and the MSI [Italian Social Movement] is 
no simple matter. They are stepping up efforts to reach an 
accord by asking [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi to be their 
protector with regard to [League Secretary] Bossi and [National 
Alliance coordinator] Fini. 
  Significantly, the two CCD [Christian Democratic Center] 
coordinators Clemente Mastella and Pierferdinando Casini began 
"crucial talks" with their heavyweight allies at Forza Italia's 
Rome headquarters yesterday. The Christian Democrats met for 
three hours in the morning to discuss the entire political and 
electoral "package" which they intend to submit to the other 
parties. Franco Fausti, from Rome, made no secret of where the 
crux of the matter lies: "It would be a serious political 
error," he said, "to restrict discussions with us to a mere 
matter of constituencies. What we want, above all, is to be 
recognized as a relevant political force. And clearly this 
aspect must be made evident to the voters: This recognition can 
under no circumstances be restricted to a simple pat on the 
back." 
  The political accord with Forza Italia and the Center, [CCD 
coordinator] D'Onofrio added, was established "on the basis of 
the full recognition of our essential role. If this premise is 
lacking, we will obviously not be able to take part in furtjer 
meetings with the other political forces, National Alliance and 
the League. We want to ascertain whether Forza Italia attaches 
primary importance a political alliance with the CCD, in the 
sense of a political party rather than a group of people seeking 
to uphold their own candidacies, preferably in safe 
constituencies. I have no doubt that any if grass-roots leaders 
were to oppose this move, this would be endorsed by its national 
leaders." 
  Meanwhile -- partly as a message to their own allies -- the 
CCD's men are making a show of their strength. Francesco 
D'Onofrio stresses that "in certain areas like Lazio we are 
reaping the benefits of the `erosion' of the Italian Popular 
Party and we expect more people to join." And Alberto Alessi 
swears that in Sicily "60 percent of the votes that previously 
went to the DC are ours."

<F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the </F>
Democratic Party of the Left, by Mino Fuccillo; place and date 
not given: "`Italians, Beware; Berlusconi Is Deceiving You'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Occhetto] Berlusconi? It can be proved 
that he is lying when he says that wealth will ran from the 
skies as long as he is handed the keys to the government. It 
can be proved, in fact it is already apparent, that if those 
keys did ever fall into his hands, he would throw them into a 
river so that nobody could ever find them again. But to 
document his demagoguery and his questionable vision of 
democracy cannot be enough; it is not enough to say that the 
Forza Italia "miracle" is a mere illusion, that Berlusconi's 
"magic" lies only in his words. Beyond that, beyond the lies, 
there is a true fact: If they do win and if they do govern, 
millions of Italians will pay the price. All those who need 
medical attention will pay. They will pay good money -- forget 
about wealth for all. The money that Forza Italia is promising 
to the "strong" will be taken from the "weak." 
  [Fuccillo] You seem worried to me, Mr. Occhetto. Do you too 
feel that there is trouble brewing? Berlusconi's popularity 
ratings are rising, he is commanding attention, and nurturing 
hopes. Did you not forecast this, or did you fail to understand 
the situation? 
  [Occhetto] Indeed, the immediate impression is of a flood, a 
sudden downpour of water. What is coming down is the old 
system, and it is all collecting together in a single swimming 
pool. At present we are under this waterfall. But its force 
results from the fact that hitherto there has been no aggressive 
and threatening right. Now it is arriving all at once, moving 
from zero to 18 or 20 percent, or whatever it may be. We shall 
see whether this flow dries up, ebbs, or continues to increase. 
  [Fuccillo] For the present the water is flowing. The "joyful 
war machine" seems to be that of the right rather than of the 
progressive forces. 
  [Occhetto] There is no doubt that it is a war machine; 
indeed, they are intent on occupying territory. They have no 
common program other than to seize power. They cynically 
believe that this is the only important thing, and have allied 
only in order to share out slices of Italy among themselves, 
openly and shamelessly. The nationalists of the National 
Alliance together with the federalists of the League, 
notwithstanding [League Secretary] Bossi's blather. The League 
which grows furious when it hears the word "solidarity" used in 
connection with the south, together with the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] which promises aid to the south. Together, held by 
Berlusconi's right and left hands. They have formed a chain, 
and for the sake of no political principle other than: Let us 
seize Italy, then we will see. 
  [Fuccillo] Should they compete to lose? Was it not you who 
called for the establishment of an Italian right? 
  [Occhetto] I expressed the hope for the emergence of a right 
capable of proposing a government, not a group of enemy gangs 
coming together solely to occupy territory, just as, and worse 
than, in the past, when the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and 
the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] occupied the state. 
  [Fuccillo] Be that as it may, they are together, and they 
are 
strong... 
  [Occhetto] They seem strong, but it cannot be taken for 
granted that the League, Forza Italia, the MSI, and the former 
Christian Democrats can come together without losing something. 
I would ask those voters who have become League supporters out 
of a sense of disgust and protest: Do they not realize that 
they are being offered an even worse form of Craxism, its 
poisoned fruit? That same Berlusconi that every history book 
would describe as a monument to the entrepreneurship that 
emerged in the shadow of that regime? 
  [Fuccillo] Perhaps those voters are concerned less with the 
past and more with the paradise promised by Berlusconi and 
company, the paradise where there are no longer any taxes to pay. 
  [Occhetto] Taxes will fall if the state is reformed, and 
that 
is our objective -- to really reduce them for those who are now 
paying too much, and not to promise that those who have never 
paid their taxes will never have to pay them again. As for the 
promised paradise, if Berlusconi were ever to explain who would 
have to pay, it would become apparent that it would be like a 
hell for millions of Italians. It is no accident that 
Berlusconi talks a lot but will not answer any questions. 
  [Fuccillo] You say he talks a lot. Do you want to reduce his 
number of minutes, in fact hours, on television? 
  [Occhetto] I would grant Berlusconi even more minutes and 
hours as long as he agreed to an exchange of views, a debate, to 
answer some questions. But he will not and cannot. He can only 
exercise his charm at long distance, like a flash of lightning. 
To succeed in making him talk about specifics in a specific 
manner would be like putting on the light and ending the dream. 
I appeal to him to conduct a debate in public with the others, 
if he can. He says that he suspects censorship. Let me 
reassure him, as far as I can: no limits, no excuses for him to 
act the martyr. For him, who is deafening us, to be afraid of 
being gagged: That is absurd. That is, unless for Berlusconi 
being gagged means not being able to do whatever he wants while 
the rest cannot. Or is it no longer the case that the rules 
must be the same for everyone? He moves like a tank, and we are 
not stupid enough to try to bar the way to him, but we never 
want tanks, especially when we are talking about government and 
information. 
  [Fuccillo] It seems likely that there will be some 
reckonings 
and in fact some acts of revenge after the elections. If the 
progressive forces win, will their adversaries have to plead for 
mercy? 
  [Occhetto] Rotation in government does not stop after the 
first round; the first election under the new system is not the 
key to establishing a new totalitarian regime. If this had been 
our intention, we would have tried to remain as before and would 
not have exposed ourselves, would not have been the first to 
pursue, with conviction, the democratic risk of winning or 
losing. But Berlusconi does not reason this way: As far as he 
is concerned, there is the pole for freedom, that is, the right, 
and the pole of evil, that is, all the rest. I believe that we 
are all full members of the pole for freedom, and whoever denies 
this is unwittingly admitting that he considers freedom his own 
private privilege. 
  [Fuccillo] Let us come to your own alignment, that of the 
progressive forces: When it comes to discussing candidates, 
people are kicking each other under the table. Do you know what 
I was told by someone from your party in Emilia? "They are 
sending us here people to elect with our votes, and telling us 
that we must do so because they are moderate candidates. Well, 
we have been moderates ever since 1943." 
  [Occhetto] For one thing, the table has eight legs, and the 
political problems seem to have been resolved. Also, I would 
tell you that when it comes to choosing candidates there comes a 
point when you feel like despairing: You are confronted with 
five or six different criteria, all beyond criticism, but 
mutually conflicting. The remark that you cited is both 
perceptive and true. There are those who are entitled to tell 
us how victory can be achieved in their own constituency without 
having to be told by Occhetto, [Rete Secretary] Orlando, or 
[Democratic Alliance leader] Adornato. But some are rather less 
in the right. Be that as it may, after a history of the left 
composed of hostility and cannibalism, we have already 
established a minor miracle, whereby we are seeking candidates 
capable of both winning and persuading. This criterion must 
prevail above all others. 
  [Fuccillo] The candidates issue is not the only problem for 
the progressive forces: You seem to be in disagreement over who 
should be prime minister and who should comprise the government 
team. 
  [Occhetto] Look, I have here on my desk the remarks in which 
centrist leader D'Onofrio, accuses me of having ruined [Prime 
Minister] Ciampi's chances, no less, simply by stressing that I 
appreciate what he has done in government. I do not want to 
attach too much importance to D'Onofrio, but the issue that you 
raise is a serious one, and my reply is that I have respected, 
and I still respect, Ciampi's desire to stand aloof from the 
various alignments. However, nobody can prevent me from 
believing that Ciampi is, and will remain, a democratic asset.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League leader Umberto Bossi </F>
by Daniele Vimercati on 6 February in Bologna: "We Can Reach 
Agreement With Berlusconi in Two Hours"] 
  [Text] Bologna -- Umberto Bossi, the night after. He 
talked about the League, the imminent elections, Sisde, and 
[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi -- "someone who seems unreal on 
television, who in person is different, practical, and who 
speaks clearly. You can make yourself understood with him in a 
couple of minutes." Calm and rested, as though the congress 
marathon were already a distant memory, the League leader 
relaxed in front of a rare steak in the restaurant of the 
Holiday Inn very near the conference hall. The magic moment, 
League supporters believe, occurred when the secretary 
proclaimed, and put to the vote, the Pole for Freedom -- with 
Silvio Berlusconi and Forza Italia, with the "wreckage of the 
old parties," and with the quick-change artists who really are 
willing to change, but without [National Alliance leader] 
Gianfranco Fini's right. A center force based on economic 
liberalism and federalism, opposed "to the three linchpins of 
state control -- Christian Democrats, communists, and fascists." 
  [Vimercati] But how can you explain this to Berlusconi? 
  [Bossi] As I have already said, anticommunism is not enough. 
Berlusconi must choose -- either with us to promote economic 
liberalism, or with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] to halt 
change. The North belongs to the League, and if he wants to 
attempt exchanges of electoral favors with anyone in the South, 
I do not care. But I am sure that we will overcome these 
stumbling blocks and that everything will go well in the end. 
  [Vimercati] But you are so different -- you, sanguine, 
impetuous, and careless in your dress; he, so fastidious, 
careful about matters of tone, in his suit...the proletarian and 
the plutocrat. Will you get along? 
  [Bossi] I think that Berlusconi is different from the way he 
appears, or from the way his people, with some political 
naivety, make him appear. I saw him on television, and he did 
not look real. 
  [Vimercati] So you did see him. It is not true that you were 
asleep while Berlusconi was talking in Rome, as the newspapers 
said. 
  [Bossi] I got up late because I spent the night drafting the 
congress document. I do not have people who write for me. I 
saw Berlusconi later, on the television news. As I said, he 
looked unreal, but that impression from the television does not 
do him justice. Basically he is not an elitist; in fact he is 
an easy- going Milanese, to whom I can tell it like it is. I 
say to him: "As far as I am concerned, it is simple. Can we 
agree?" And he answers me in the same vein; we understand one 
another. 
  [Vimercati] Even when you are talking about candidates? 
  [Bossi] Of course. It is simpler than people think. We sit 
in front of a map and decide: my man here, yours there, mine 
here, yours there; here we have something of a problem -- it is 
yours! We can settle the whole thing in a couple of hours. 
  [Vimercati] Is there not even a small place for the 
Christian 
Democratic centrists? 
  [Bossi] The old faces could make a generous gesture and sit 
this one out. But if they really insist, we will find a seat 
for Mastella and D'Onofrio in the South. There is room. But do 
not print that, otherwise we will have people lining up outside 
our house tomorrow. 
  [Vimercati] Will your people still like a Bossi who goes 
around with Berlusconi in his blue double-breasted suit? 
  [Bossi] There will be no major difficulties, because 
Berlusconi is a different kind of rich man. True, he made his 
money under the old regime, but he has always had the communists 
against him and he had to negotiate with the rest because he had 
no alternative. He does not look like the manager of an 
ironworks, like Gianni Agnelli, who could never contest the 
elections. 
  [Vimercati] Are you not afraid that Berlusconi will steal a 
large number of your votes and ultimately deprive you of the 
leadership of this Pole for Freedom? 
  [Bossi] I am being careful, but I am not afraid. I realize 
that Berlusconi has some power of attraction. He may win over 
people who are still afraid of the League, but he is stealing 
those votes not from us but from [Italian Popular Party (PPI) 
Secretary] Martinazzoli, and is thus killing the final vestiges 
of the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. In the bar the other 
day I was pestered by some hulking fellow with callused hands 
who kept saying: "We need Berlusconi!" Eventually I told him to 
get lost, but in its generic way, Forza Italia's message could 
win much support.... I would call it pre-political support, 
more in the South than in the North. 
  [Vimercati] Why do you think Berlusconi entered politics? 
  [Bossi] Well, at first perhaps he was forced to do so by 
Mediobanca, by Agnelli and the DC, and by their respective 
banks, who tried to destroy the League by unleashing the 
judiciary against me. They tried to make him the good League 
leader, who would win over our votes and bring them back into 
the system. But that plan went wrong; I halted the sword of 
justice; but by then the mechanism had been set in motion.... 
  [Vimercati] If he had wanted to, Berlusconi could have 
withdrawn. 
  [Bossi] I do not know what he thought. Maybe by then he 
realized that Forza Italia could perform a major role, or 
perhaps he was afraid for the future.... Some time ago 
[Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto was pursuing 
me. Perhaps Berlusconi feared an accord with the communists. 
  [Vimercati] The election is drawing nearer. Your adversaries 
are becoming increasingly dangerous. The left-wing forces have 
already presented their symbol. What do you think of that? 
  [Bossi] That red-green wave is ridiculous; it is a petty 
thing planned in the abstract, with no feeling, by people who 
have no imagination. How can it be compared with the vast tide 
of the League? Our symbol, the warrior of Legnano, is much 
stronger and more powerful. We will never relinquish it, partly 
for the sake of clarity with respect to the voters. 
  [Vimercati] Is it true that, by using different symbols in 
the single-candidate and proportional stages, the left-wing 
forces hope to avert dismemberment in the elections and thus to 
gain a few additional seats? 
  [Bossi] It is true, they are trying to rob us of a dozen 
deputies by such petty means. But they will not succeed. I 
have already told [League lower house floor leader] Maroni to 
appeal to Interior Minister Mancini to seek guarantees. I am 
worried; this election is a war, and I do not want to concern 
myself with skirmishes, too. I do not trust Mancino and his 
tricks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino by </F>
Gian Battista Bozzo in Rome; date not given: "Martino: 
Reducing Taxes? It Is Possible"] 
  [Text] With what he is saying in this interview, Antonio 
Martino could overtake [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi 
in terms of popularity on the tax issue among League 
sympathizers, and indeed all who believe tax decentralization to 
be the right thing. These statements by the Forza Italia 
economist are not a provocation, but the end results of a far 
from short or easy process, but one which needs to be begun. In 
short, a tax reform which would end up taking the entire 
taxation process out of the hands of the center, that is the 
Ministry of Finance, and transferring it to reformed and 
efficient local authorities. But in the meantime, Martino 
explained, one must work in two directions: on the one hand to 
reduce overall tax pressure, gradually but without hesitation, 
and on the other hand to clarify the rules for preparing the 
budget. First and foremost, Article 81 of the Constitution (no 
illegal expenditures), which Parliament has never implemented, 
must be applied. 
  [Bozzo] First of all the rules, Professor Martino? 
  [Martino] To me it seems obvious that it is necessary to 
abandon the present arbitrary system. Our problems derive from 
the fact that, in the absence of rules, everyone (and I am 
saying everyone, including the left) has used public expenditure 
for electoral purposes. And hence the enormous growth of 
expenditure has provoked a tax explosion, a boom, which has 
however remained insufficient to cover outgoings. The whole 
history of our public debt is here. And this is why we need 
rules: We can no longer give politicians blank checks. 
  [Bozzo] In addition to rules, Forza Italia is also demanding 
a ceiling to the tax burden. 
  [Martino] The meaning of the tax ceiling is simple: first of 
all one must decide how much one can take out of the economy 
without killing it. After that one establishes how to spend 
these resources. 
  [Bozzo] It has been said that this is a demagogic 
proposition, that we cannot reduce taxes in Italy today. 
  [Martino] The left has criticized the rule. To me this is 
unacceptable. It could not criticize the amount, as I have 
never said what the ceiling should be: It could even be equal 
to the present one. The fact of the matter is that the left 
wishes to continue to spend without control. This being said, I 
would add that it is possible to reduce tax pressure, even if 
this has to be gradual: One cannot withdraw an addict's drugs 
all at once. But taxation can be limited, and rationalized. 
Zero cost reforms exist: simplified execution and the 
elimination of taxes which yield little or nothing. 
  [Bozzo] Do you think that it is possible to reduce income 
tax 
rates? Also: What are you proposing in terms of business 
taxation? 
  [Martino] Reducing progressive personal income tax rates is 
essential, because tax rates of 50 percent not only yield 
little, but favor evasion. Then we need to untax employment, 
because, let us not forget, more than half of labor costs end up 
in the taxman's hands. I would propose an exemption for new 
"net job positions." Let me explain: "net" in order to avoid 
the fraud which consists of dismissing in order to rehire. And 
a total exemption for reinvested assets. 
  [Bozzo] Let us now come, Professor Martino, to tax 
decentralization. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]'s 
"finance minister" Visco is now talking of tax federalization. 
  [Martino] I do not know whether my project will be included 
in its entirety into the Forza Italia economic program. 
Nonetheless I have in mind a radical proposal, the 
implementation of which, obviously, requires time and a series 
of major reforms. Once a complete rearrangement of local 
authorities has been completed with, say, some 50 
macromunicipalities, I would then entrust them with total tax 
authority, taking it away completely from the center. With two 
limits: 50 percent of income would have to be transferred to 
Rome, and a ban on recourse to market indebtedness. The reform, 
the final point of a long series of changes, would give citizens 
ever so much greater control of income and expenditure. 
  [Bozzo] By way of conclusion: Do you like the idea of a 
superminister of the economy and privatization? 
  [Martino] In theory yes, but without rules even the best 
superminister will fail. As to privatization, I would simply 
say that, if there is an excess demand for the company shares 
being issued on the market, evidently the price is low.

  [Text] For the Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian fleet's new 
flagship, it will be the first real "operational mission." In a 
few days' time, the small aircraft carrier will be off the coast 
of Mogadishu at the head of the naval task force responsible for 
protecting and supporting the withdrawal of the Italian troops 
from Somalia. 
  "Operation Garibaldi," which was decided on by Defense 
Minister Fabio Fabbri, was planned under the supervision of 
Admiral Guido Venturoni, chief of defense staff. The navy had 
little choice whether or not to use the Garibaldi: The cruiser 
Vittorio Veneto, an aging flag ship, despite its glorious past, 
is too old a ship and has a smaller flight deck than the 
Giuseppe Garibaldi. 
  The Garibaldi can carry AV-SB vertical-takeoff fighter 
aircraft (the American version of the British Sea Harrier), but 
the aircraft cannot be used in Somalia: None of the aircraft is 
operational yet. "However, we do not believe that aircraft are 
indispensable in the type of operation that we are preparing to 
carry out in Somalia," says a naval general staff source: "The 
protection and transport capability provided by the helicopters 
are sufficient guarantee of effective cover." 
  The Garibaldi will be accompanied off Mogadishu by a 
frigate, 
the San Marco battalion's two amphibious ships, which will 
accommodate most of the army's bersaglieri [riflemen] returning 
to Italy, and a supply ship. 
  Italy has also reached additional agreements with the 
government of Kenya guaranteeing access to the runways at 
Nairobi airport: The air force's C-130 and G-222 aircraft whose 
job it will be to bring the last soldiers in Somalia back to 
Italy will land in the Kenyan capital. 
  The operation that is planned is a massive one, confirming 
the fears prevailing at the Italian Defense Ministry. 
Yesterday, Minister Fabbri confirmed, discreetly, that the 
intelligence services' information channels have been put into 
top gear. The information received indicates that the Somali 
irregular militias are preparing to fill the "vacuum" left by 
the Western blue berets as soon as the latter withdraw. Many 
sources expect fighting, and fighting requires weapons: If 
necessary, the Somalis will not hesitate to attack the military 
convoys as they withdraw.

  [Text] Naples, Italy, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Police have smashed a 
drug-trafficking ring involving heroin worth 50 billion lire (30 
million dollars) and arrested 42 people, police sources said 
Tuesday [8 February]. 
  A further 28 people already serving prison sentences were 
also said to be implicated in the ring, which came to light 
following confessions by five former members of the Camorra, the 
Neapolitan Mafia. 
  According to the confessions, the drug trafficking was 
controlled by 12 Mafia families headed by boss Raffaele Ascione. 
  Up to 1,000 fixes of heroin a day were being sold by the 
gang. Police did not say if they had seized the drugs.

  [Excerpts] Athens yesterday had no choice but to 
reluctantly acknowledge receipt of U.S. advance notice that 
Washington would soon announce the diplomatic recognition of 
Skopje by the name of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
(FYROM). 
  "A new U.S. position on the recognition of Skopje is 
imminent," government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos told 
reporters in the press room. He was referring to an earlier 
meeting between Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou and 
US Ambassador to Greece Thomas Niles. [passage omitted] 
  Mr Venizelos was reluctant to express Greek annoyance over 
the US move, but refused to offer easy excuses: "The American 
side has been preoccupied with this issue and has laboured over 
its own position on it for some time now, precisely because it 
takes into account the Greek stance. Up to a point, Washington 
understands -- or that's how we would like to interpret its 
stance so far -- that pressure has to be exercised on Skopje, 
because that's where the knotty problem lies, namely, how to 
bend the intransigence, the provocative attitude and the 
pseudo-irredentism of Skopje." Nevertheless, he finally admitted 
there would shortly be "an announcement of Skopje's recognition 
by the U.S." 
  Asked whether the government considered revising its 
"deterrent" diplomatic strategy after seemingly having lost its 
last trump card (which was the erstwhile U.S. reluctance to 
recognise Skopje) Mr Venizelos stopped short of admitting there 
was no other alternative. "Deterrence is not a wish, but the 
outcome of a determinate balance of international forces, which 
is beyond the power of any single country to influence on its 
own. However, a deterrent policy implies above all that we as a 
country have accurately defined our objectives. And this is 
what the government has done, reflecting a popular majority 
which transcends the electoral appeal of the (ruling) PASOK 
party."

  [Excerpts] The United States today officially recognized 
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and said it 
will establish full diplomatic relations with it. A statement 
issued by the White House notes that the decision was made in 
recognition of the democratic expression by FYROM of the duty to 
establish a sovereign and independent state based on democratic 
principles. The full recognition was announced today but full 
diplomatic relations will be established when Skopje gives 
assurances that it will cooperate constructively for the 
settlement of its dispute with Greece, a U.S. ally for many 
years, as the statement points out. [passage omitted] 
  Skopje President Kiro Gligorov, who constantly refers to his 
country as the Republic of Macedonia, said that its independence 
and stability are a prerequisite for peace and stability in the 
Balkans. He also noted that good-neighborliness is a vital 
interest of his country and that Skopje is prepared to begin 
immediately to negotiate with Greece within the UN framework in 
goodwill and a desire for mutual understanding and respect for 
mutual interests. He also said that his country respects the 
territorial integrity and borders of Greece and of all the 
neighboring countries. 
  In Athens, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou tonight 
received 
U.S. Ambassador to Greece Thomas Niles, who conveyed to him an 
official invitation from President Bill Clinton to visit the 
United States in April. 
  On the U.S. recognition of Skopje, government spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos made the following statement: The Greek 
Government expresses its discontent at the U.S. decision to 
recognize Skopje. This development is certainly not pleasant for 
Greece. It is a wrong move by the United States. However, it 
is a significant fact that the United States is specifically 
reserved about diplomatic relations with Skopje and links it 
with conditions that refer to Skopje's hostile propaganda 
against Greece and to a respect for human rights. [passage 
omitted] 
  There has also been strong reaction by the opposition. New 
Democracy chairman Miltiadhis Evert described the U.S. decision 
as a bad option and added that the Greek Government was taken by 
surprise and was confused.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias returned from 
Geneva late this evening. Our political correspondent Mirela 
Kalostipi has the following telephone dispatch with details: 
  [Begin Kolostipi recording] Good evening, Ladies and 
Gentlemen. The foreign minister returned from Geneva a short 
while ago. Naturally, correspondents were waiting for him at 
the airport and he made a statement. 
  Concerning the question of U.S. diplomatic recognition of 
Skopje, the foreign minister was asked whether the Skopjeans now 
have a reason to withdraw from their intransigent positions. 
Mr. Papoulias said that the form of recognition has room for 
the U.S. diplomacy. Today the foreign minister said the same 
thing he said when he returned from his visit to the United 
States. He made the appraisal that the normalization of 
Athens-Skopje relations is of more interest to Washington than 
any recognition. In any case, the foreign minister admitted 
that this development was not pleasant for Athens but added that 
on the chess board of international relations and balances the 
Greek Government aims at exploiting whatever is best. 
  Mr. Papoulias was asked about the statement by Andonios 
Samaras [opposition Political Spring party chairman] today that 
the U.S. diplomatic recognition of Skopje would have a negative 
effect on Greek-U.S. relations. Mr. Papoulias said he would not 
like to comment on this statement by Andonios Samaras. However, 
he said, in a critical period Andonios Samaras, who is a former 
foreign minister, should be more careful in his statements 
because, as Mr. Papoulias noted, he knows how difficult the 
issues are and how sensitive this period is. 
  The foreign minister was then asked about the Bosnian issue 
and the imminent decision regarding bombing Serbian targets 
around Sarajevo. Mr. Papoulias said that Greece's reservations 
are a clear answer to the No that we have already given on 
military interventions because, as he stressed, we have not been 
convinced by the arguments of those who support the bombings as 
to what will happen the next day. I do not bring any messages 
of optimism, Mr. Papoulias said, because many times we have had 
experiences of agreements that were upset the next day. 
Nevertheless, he stressed, the latest news is such that they 
might turn a NATO decision for bombings out of context. 
  This is all from the airport where Karolos Papoulias 
returned 
from Geneva late this evening. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Extreme... Ethnocentrism"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. recognition of the small state of Skopje 
with its temporary name, which is expected within the next few 
hours, and our country's endorsement of the European Union [EU] 
decision on possible air bombings in Bosnia are not offered for 
domestic opposition nor for trying to be more nationalist than 
the next fellow. 
  It happens that in both cases, in which we are called upon 
to 
accept or support decisions unfavorable to our country, the 
positions of our political parties are almost identical. No 
party and no Greek agrees with the air bombing in Bosnia, which 
would bring the disaster of the war to our borders. At the same 
time, there is no Greek who is not unhappy with Washington's 
decision to proceed with the recognition of the small state that 
tries to usurp the name of Macedonia. 
  This unity of political positions and popular will 
represents 
at this time our most significant national advantage, which we 
ought to utilize and promote and not downgrade or sacrifice on 
the altar of petty political expediency and partisan prejudice. 
  What weight (or rather political responsibility) could be 
used now to urge the exercise of a Greek veto in NATO or the 
cancellation of an EU decision--even by "utilizing" the Greek 
presidency--with regard to the possible bombing of Bosnia? At 
the same time, what political seriousness is there in 
suggestions for public disapproval and condemnation of 
Washington's imminent action as hostile to our country? 
  Fortunately, the ordinary Greek citizen understands and 
realizes the restructuring changes taking place worldwide and 
feels particularly lucky because he belongs to the European 
family in which nobody--even the strongest partner--can impose 
his will unilaterally. In this same family, however, even the 
weakest member has the right to demand equality of the 
Community's political, social, and economic rights or 
achievements and, what is most important, to entrust his 
national security to a political solidarity and defense 
partnership of the Twelve, things that are safeguarded by 
treaties. 
  In a similar spirit, a certain part of the Greek people have 
overcome their past bitterness, which suffered from an 
anti-American and anti-NATO syndrome. These people managed to 
overcome this position by merely asking themselves "how is it 
and why" are Albania, Bulgaria, and Skopje today hotly pursuing 
admission to NATO (to refer only to our bordering neighbors who 
until very recently belonged to the "enemy" camp)? 
  Could it be that this simple--but not naive--question should 
force the remaining supporters of pure ethnocentrism to ponder 
things irrespective of their right-wing or left-wing origin? 
This is so because their recommendations finally lead to the 
same result: our international isolation and national 
weakening....

<F P=106> [Article by Dhespoina Dhasenaki: "Seeking the Centrists"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Many call them "the centrists" for the sake of 
brevity, but stress that they bear no relation to the 
traditional political center. Others call them "the middle 
ground" because their profile reflects the image of the average 
voters. However, almost all admit that these are the voters who 
give the victory to the party they choose. This is why they are 
the "prize to win" among parties. 
  What makes them attractive is mainly the fact that they are 
increasingly in evidence. The last poll conducted by the ALKO 
organization after the elections (from 5 to 12 December among 
1,200 voters over age 18 residing in the Attiki basin) shows 
that about one in four voters (24 percent) are on the same wave 
length. Moreover, they are the voters on whom the final outcome 
usually depends. 
  Poll results are characteristic: some 77 percent of this 
group of voters chose the Panhellenic Socialist Movement 
[PASOK]. A total of 12.1 percent voted for Political Spring and 
only 8 percent went with the New Democracy [ND]. 
  The ALKO research also confirmed the "move" by showing that 
among ND voters who went over to PASOK in the last elections, 
59.5 percent belong to the group that calls itself "centrist." 
The corresponding number who went over to Political Spring is 
10.8 percent. The "success story" of this type of voters within 
the parties' political strategy offices is therefore not at all 
strange. 
<H5>  What They Believe </H5>
  They call themselves "centrists," but also distance 
themselves from ideologies. They want "lower tones" in politics, 
consider quality-of-life issues very important, do not reach 
early political conclusions and ask for an economic policy as 
realistic as possible. 
  According to ND deputy Y. Karatzaferis, "they are the voters 
who elect a government." "In the last elections, they gave the 
victory to PASOK," agrees K. Karamanlis, responsible for 
political planning in the ND, who emphasizes that the importance 
of this group of voters as far as political strategy is 
concerned rests on the fact that it is loose and more easily 
movable. PASOK deputy D. Beis even calls them "snipers," since 
"they first criticize the government and the opposition and then 
decide for whom they will vote." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  "Middle Ground" </H5>
  Karamanlis chooses a different terminology. "We are not 
talking about the center. This is a term selected by pollsters 
to facilitate their task. We could talk about a `middle ground,' 
even if this is an oversimplification." 
  According to K. Skandhalidhis, minister of the Aegean and 
member of the PASOK executive bureau, "this is a combination of 
social groups coming from different starting points: the new 
technological and economic strata, groups who choose their 
position strictly on the basis of their economic situation and 
are constantly becoming larger in recent years, a segment of the 
undecided voters, and large strata of the new generation who are 
not inspired by the general situation of the political system." 
  Karamanlis separates them into two basic subcategories: 
"Older persons from 35 to 45, who in the past belonged, to a 
great extent, to the wider leftist space, but are presently 
maintaining a critical stance, and younger persons unrelated to 
parties who are generally apolitical." 
<H5>  The Majority </H5>
  The "middle ground" is also the result of the demographic 
profile of this group, which apparently resembles the profile of 
the general population: a few more women than men (53 percent 
compared with 47 percent), a few more people 55 to 64 than in 
the general population, a few more individuals with an 
elementary education (31 percent compared to 24 percent). 
However, if we add the percentages for all ages under 55, there 
are more younger individuals. 
  Meanwhile, what do these voters say about the group? Despite 
considering themselves "centrists," when asked what the nature 
of economic policy ought to be, they answer that it should be 
"far from ideologies." However, if pressed to choose an economic 
policy, they opt for a socialist system (33 percent), with only 
5 percent choosing a market system. 
<H5>  With Maturity </H5>
  This guarded stance is also apparent when they are asked 
what 
they think of the government's economic measures. Some 43 
percent answer that it is still too early to judge, while 42 
percent say that they trust it. 
  However, their opinion becomes even more apparent when they 
are asked to prioritize the country's problems. Even if they 
list them in the same order as the general population, 
differences in the degree of interest are telling. The so-called 
middle ground seems to be more interested in issues of health, 
insurance, education, and quality of life. Respondents who see 
themselves as "centrists" selected the economy as the most 
important problem (79 percent), followed by foreign policy (57 
percent), health/insurance (52 percent), education (45 percent), 
quality of life (29 percent), public administrtion (10 percent), 
institutions (8 percent), culture (5 percent), and 
decentralization (4 percent).

  [Text] Ankara, Feb 9 (A.A) -- Turkey said on Wednesday [9 
February] that it would not attend a meeting due to be held in 
Geneva on Wednesday with countries bordering former Yugoslavia. 
  Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman said at his 
weekly briefing that there are doubts about the timing. 
  "We think nothing now must detract from the priority of the 
possibility of removing Serbian positions (around Sarajevo) by 
an air intervention." 
  "Our demand and expectation from NATO is that it takes 
decisions to produce action and results without delay," Ataman 
said. "We are hopeful and optimistic." 
  Ambassadors of 16 NATO members gathered for a crucial 
meeting 
in Brussels on Wednesday to decide whether to send an ultimatum 
to Serbs to withdraw forces besieging Sarajevo in 10 days or 
face air strikes. 
  "We observe a strong and general wish to take measures to 
stop this savagery without delay," Ataman said. "NATO is at an 
important junction. Its credibility is at stake." 
  Turkey has had a squadron of F-16 planes attached to a NATO 
force based in Italy since last year to patrol Bosnia skies and 
Ataman said the force could be utilized if NATO command wanted. 
  Sixty eight civilians were massacred and 200 wounded when 
Serbian mortar turned a Sarajevo marketplace into a pool of 
blood.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
said that when the PP comes to power there will be economic 
development and Turkey will be turned into a leading country. 
  At a meeting in Mugla, Erbakan stated that the parties that 
have been governing Turkey for the past 50 years have brought 
misery on the people. He alleged that because of the practice 
of charging interest, the country's economy is collapsing. Our 
correspondent Omer Kebabcioglu reports that Erbakan explained 
that interest affects prices. 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] Everything is being done on the 
basis of interest in this country. Interest is written off as 
expenses and is included in the price of goods. Ultimately, it 
is you, the citizens, who pay for all the interest paid in the 
banks. The interest crushes you. Look, one third of my jacket 
is interest. One third of my shoes is interest. One third of 
cheese is interest. Everything is interest. You pay for the 
interest in the end, because you voted for those who believe in 
interest. On the other hand taxes are levied on profits, and 
profits are made on sold goods. Profits are included in the 
prices. This means that the low income groups pay for all the 
taxes paid. 
  What I am saying is that when the PP establishes a just 
order, it will lift all this interest. [end recording] 
  Addressing meetings in Denizli and Afyon, Erbakan charged 
that the government is pursuing the wrong foreign policy. On 
the massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Erbakan said that it a shame 
for humanity that the world is remaining passive before these 
savage acts. He stressed that the United States and the world 
do not want to intervene, adding: They want to see the Muslims 
eliminated. 
  Erbakan said that the government is compromising regarding 
Cyprus. Only we will be able to solve foreign policy problems, 
he said.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The ceremony for the 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who arrived in Ankara on an 
official visit, was held at Cankaya Mansion this afternoon. 
General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; ANAP 
[Motherland Party] leader Mesut Yilmaz; ministers and other 
officials, participated in the ceremony. 
  In a speech he delivered at the ceremony, President Suleyman 
Demirel said that Aliyev's visit, which coincides with a period 
when significant developments are taking place, will enable a 
useful exchange of views on regional and international issues 
concerning both countries. 
  Indicating that the Armenian attacks prevent both the 
socioeconomic and political formation of Azerbaijan, which has 
embarked on a process of reconstruction and unification with the 
international community, Demirel stated that this situation is 
starting to endanger regional stability. Demirel further noted 
that nothing can be achieved -- neither territorial acquisition 
nor political advantage -- with these acts of aggression which 
are in violation of international norms, adding that he takes 
advantage of this occasion to condemn the Armenian aggression 
once more. 
  Noting that Turkey attaches great importance to regional 
peace and cooperation, Demirel added that he sincerely believes 
that stability and security cannot be separated. For this 
reason, Demirel further stated, he believes that the conflict 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia will be justly solved when 
Azerbaijan's territorial integrity is achieved. Demirel said: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] It has to be known that Turkey 
will not be content with supporting Azerbaijan only in 
international issues. While embracing its Azeri brothers as a 
state and nation after a 70-year longing, Turkey, as a 
contemporary democratic state, will also continue to extend 
all-out assistance in the reconstruction process of Azerbaijan. 
[end recording] 
  Aliyev, in turn, indicated that Turkey and Azerbaijan had 
established a close cooperation and support in recent years and 
added that the newly constituted Azerbaijan Republic has always 
been aware of Turkey's support and help. Explaining that the 
most important issue Azerbaijan faces is the Armenian 
aggression, Aliyev added that his people strongly feel Turkey's 
assistance regarding this aggressiveness. 
  Adding that Azerbaijan conducts a peaceful policy, Aliyev 
said that their aim is to have friendly relations with their 
neighbors. Aliyev said: 
  [Begin Aliyev recording] We are calling on the concerned 
countries', especially Turkey's, support in achieving a peaceful 
solution to the artificial Karabakh issue which was created by 
the Armenians. [end recording] 
  Subsequently, the two presidents held a meeting and 
thereafter the respective delegations of the two countries 
started their discussions. Aliyev later received Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller at the hotel where he is residing and conferred 
with her for some time. The guest president also met Motherland 
Party leader Mesut Yilmaz. Aliyev will continue with his 
contacts in Ankara tomorrow and depart from Turkey on Saturday.

  [Excerpts] President Suleyman Demirel has expressed the 
hope that the Armenians will immediately and unconditionally 
withdraw from all the Azerbaijani territory they have occupied 
in line with the UN resolution. He added: Otherwise, sooner or 
later they will have to go just as they have come. 
  Demirel hosted a dinner in honor of Azerbaijani President 
Geydar Aliyev at the Cankaya Mansion. Addressing the dinner, 
Demirel said that they have a close friendship with Aliyev that 
goes back many years, adding that Aliyev is not a prominent 
statesmen of Azerbaijan alone but of all the Turkic world. 
Noting that there is no need to explain the closeness of 
Turkish-Azerbaijani relations, Demirel said: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] [passage omitted] Today's talks 
were held in all sincerity and honesty reflecting the relations 
between two friendly states. [end recording] 
  Demirel said that Turkey and Azerbaijan are a single nation 
and two states, adding that there exist no problems between 
them. Pointing out that at today's talks an agreement was 
reached to make the most of the existing potential, Demirel said 
that the agreement to be signed tomorrow will document their 
mutual political will and provide the security sought by Turkish 
businessmen for investments. Pointing out that regional problems 
were also discussed in depth, Demirel said that the fact that 20 
percent of Azerbaijani territory is occupied by Armenians poses 
a threat to regional peace, stability and security. Demirel 
continued: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] From the very beginning of the 
conflict we called on the Armenians to respect Azerbaijan's 
territorial integrity. We pointed out that such a stand is in 
the interests of all the regional countries and primarily 
Armenia. The Armenians, however, have continued to seek the 
solution through brute force. We hope that the Armenians will 
immediately and unconditionally withdraw from all the 
Azerbaijani territory they have occupied in line with the UN 
resolution. Otherwise, sooner or later they will have to go 
just as they have come. [end recording] 
  Demirel said that one can observe that the Azerbaijani 
people 
have acquired a new consciousness regarding the concept of 
nation and expressed his satisfaction over the issue. He noted 
that at the talks they have also decided to consolidate 
bilateral relations through cooperation at international 
organizations in which both Turkey and Azerbaijan are members. 
Demirel said that Turkey will continue to extend the necessary 
support and assistance to Azerbaijan's efforts to unite with the 
international community. 
  Aliyev said that after gaining its independence, Azerbaijan 
has begun to attach great importance to developing its ties of 
friendship and brotherhood with Turkey. He added that the ties 
between Azerbaijan and Turkey, which date back to history, have 
never been severed despite the difficult periods. Stressing 
that the peoples of the two countries have immediately formed a 
close rapport despite the fact that they have remained apart for 
70 years, Aliyev added that it is their duty to further advance 
the bilateral relations. 
  Pointing out that the Azerbaijani Army has attained 
significant victories in defending the country's integrity 
through great sacrifices, Aliyev said: We still maintain that 
the path of peace is in the forefront of our war plan. We will, 
however, continue our just struggle to attain our goal. 
Thanking Turkey for all aid the it has extended in all fields, 
Aliyev concluded by expressing the hope that it will continue. 
  After the dinner, Aliyev received Democratic Left Party 
leader Bulent Ecevit and conferred with him for some time.

agreements and protocols envisaging cooperation between the two 
countries in various fields. Speaking at the signing ceremony 
at the Cankaya Mansion, President Demirel pointed out that the 
agreements which aim at developing multifaceted cooperation 
between the two brotherly countries and which cover all fields 
will also bring new life to the existing agreements. He stated 
that with his diagnosis and realistic assessments regarding 
various issues, the visiting president shed light on these 
issues. Demirel said: Aliyev's loyalty to the Azerbaijani ideal 
inspires his nation and stirs us. 
  [Begin Demirel recording] Despite difficult conditions, 
Azerbaijan is forcefully trying to restructure itself as a 
state. It is trying to harmoniously carry out the process of its 
social change, and preparing the infrastructure necessary for a 
transition to a free market economy. Last, but not least, our 
Azerbaijani brothers, headed by Mr. Aliyev, are determined to 
establish a pluralistic, participatory, and democratic system. 
All these factors have led us to look to the near future 
together with hope. The fact that our two states are joined in 
the ideal of democracy will add a new power to the strong ties 
between our two peoples. [end recording] 
  The Azerbaijani president said that the agreements will 
further advance the existing relations in all fields. 
  After this ceremony, Azerbaijani President Aliyev gave a 
reception for the chiefs of foreign missions in Ankara.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev has said that 
the work on exploiting the Azerbaijani oil fields will be 
concluded this month and that Turkey will also participate in 
the agreements to be concluded on the issue. 
  Replying to questions by a Turkish Radio and Television 
correspondent, Aliyev said that he does not foresee any changes 
regarding Turkey's share in the agreement. Pointing out that 
there are various oil pipeline projects, Aliyev added, however, 
that in most of these projects having the pipeline cross Turkey 
is a high consideration. 
  He noted that Azerbaijan's relations with Russia are 
continuing on their normal course but that the cease-fire plan 
that has been proposed was not found suitable. Aliyev stated 
that Azerbaijan will be deciding on which countries might 
participate in the peacekeeping forces to be stationed in 
Karabakh and that his country wants Turkey to participate in 
these forces. He noted that the unconditional withdrawal of 
Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory is the first 
condition for a possible peace agreement with the Armenians.

<F P=106> [Report by Goksel Polat: "Iranian Diplomats Encourage </F>
Reactionary Trend"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been ascertained that Iranian 
officials help Turkish citizens who sympathize with Iran's views 
to visit Tehran either legally or illegally in order to receive 
religious instruction in that country. According to official 
reports, nearly 100 Turkish citizens received instruction in 
religious schools in Qom thus far. All of them have returned to 
Turkey. 
  The General Directorate of Police has drawn up a report on 
Iran's reactionary activities against Turkey and submitted it to 
high-ranking officials in Ankara a few days ago. CUMHURIYET has 
acquired that report. It said that Iran has maintained its 
effort to spread the Islamic revolution to Turkey since 1983 and 
noted that Tehran's activities pose a threat to Turkey's unity 
and security. Stressing that Iran's diplomatic missions and 
establishments have an important role in that country's 
activities, the report said that the activities aimed at 
spreading Iran's revolution are organized within the structure 
of Iran's embassy, consulates general, and consulates and the 
Iranian officials significantly benefit from their diplomatic 
immunity to promote them. 
  The report listed the diplomatic missions' activities as 
follows: 
  a. Transfer and distribution of propaganda from Iran. 
  b. Organization of meetings to enlighten Turkish citizens on 
the Islamic Revolution. 
  c. Organization of the activities of Iranian students who 
study in Turkey. 
  d. Organization of the legal or illegal travel of Turkish 
citizens who sympathize with Iran's views to Tehran to receive 
religious training. 
  e. Establishment and surveillance of the opponents of the 
Iranian regime in Turkey and the individuals and groups that 
carry out activities against the Turkish Government. 
  f. Activities aimed at gathering information on Turkey. 
  The report stressed that the Iranian cultural centers 
spearhead the establishments involved in intensive propaganda 
activities and noted that the speakers in the meetings, 
seminars, and panel discussions that are held in those centers 
address both the Iranian and the Turkish citizens. The report 
also drew attention to the question of headdress in the 
universities and said that the Iranian missions exploit that 
problem and use it as propaganda material in order to influence 
the students. Furthermore, it said that the Iranian students 
have a significant role in Iran's propaganda activities, which 
defend the view that secularism is a state of heresy and 
criticize the principles and reforms of Kemal Ataturk, founder 
of Turkey. The report stressed that several Iranian students 
are responsible for distributing leaflets and documents, 
controlling the situation and behavior of Iranian students in 
Turkey, selecting Turkish students to be sent to Iran, 
establishing contacts with extremist religious groups, and 
broadening the propaganda on Iran's revolution and Shia 
practices. 
  The report asserted that publications play an important 
role in the Iranian missions' propaganda activities and noted 
that Iranian magazines, newspapers, brochures, booklets, and 
cassette tapes are dispatched to Turkey in diplomatic pouches. 
It stressed: "Meanwhile, the Iranian cultural centers 
distribute or mail their publications, including the books they 
publish on religious festivals and other important days, to the 
Turkish citizens free of charge." 
  The report said that the Iranian officials have also focused 
attention on the Sunni sect in Turkey. It noted the following: 
"It is common knowledge that the Iranian officials are making 
an intensive effort to weaken the concept of Islam in the Sunni 
people and establish non-Shia marginal groups among the 
followers of the Sunni sect who will be influenced by the Shia 
concept of Islam and will agree that Shia is the true sect in 
Islam. In fact, they have had many books, magazines, and other 
printed material published by the printing houses they support 
to realize their objectives." 
  Regarding the religious training given to the Turkish 
citizens in Iran, the report said: "It is common knowledge that 
our citizens are included among the students from the Islamic 
countries who attend the religious training programs in Qom for 
four or five years, that these programs are based on the Shia 
concept of Islam, that the foreign participants in the religious 
programs are paid 60-70 Iranian tumans [1 tuman equals 10 rials] 
in the form of material aid, that Iran meets all their housing 
and training expenses, and that those who complete their 
training are used for propaganda purposes in their own 
countries. It is also common knowledge that religious training 
has been given to nearly 100 Turkish citizens thus far. All of 
them have returned to Turkey."

  [Text] Ankara -- Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk's 
proposal -- which calls for the establishment of a new 
government under his leadership in an attempt to avoid a 
political crisis that he anticipates will follow the March 27 
local elections -- has been received with opposition from the 
partners of the ruling coalition government. 
  While ministers of the senior coalition partner, the True 
Path Party (DYP), have characterized Cindoruk's plan as 
"fanciful," ministers affiliated with the junior coalition 
partner, the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), have pointed 
to Cindoruk's claims of a potential crisis are being purely 
speculative. 
  SHP Chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin told 
reporters that Cindoruk was making speculative assumptions prior 
to the upcoming local elections. 
  But, Karayalcin added, due to the preelection atmosphere in 
Turkey, such speculation was predictable. 
  In Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan's reaction to the 
proposal, 
he reminded his audience that when Cindoruk had the opportunity 
to become prime minister during the DYP's party convention in 
1993, he declined the position in favor of Tansu Ciller. Golhan 
said: "The existing coalition government shall continue. 
Parliament Speaker Cindoruk could have become prime minister if 
he wanted to. But, he had then proposed Ciller." 
  State Minister Obrahim Tez from the SHP, who also stressed 
that the coalition government would remain intact after the 
local elections, said: "This government should continue to 
remain in power after the local elections for Turkey's 
stability. The government may have some deficiencies, but we 
are doing whatever is necessary to overcome them." 
  Agriculture Minister Refaiddin Sahin from the DYP wing of 
the 
government said he disagreed with Cindoruk's views. 
  Pointing out that only the DYP's competent bodies wee 
authorized to call for early elections, Sahin said it was the 
nation, as a whole, that would decided what to do after the 
March 27 local elections. He added that whatever the nation 
decided would be the most suitable and reasonable decision. 
  Sahin also stressed, in a reference to Cindoruk, that those 
experienced in politics should not present illogical scenarios 
or predictions that ignore political realities. 
  Main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut 
Yilmaz 
said he and his colleagues agreed with Cindoruk's proposal in 
principle, but disagreed with its duration and function. 
  In a press conference at ANAP headquarters, Yilmaz said he 
viewed such a government as a temporary one, which should last 
only as long as the law permits. 
  He defined this period as being no longer than either two or 
three months. 
  He emphasized that the proposed one-year transition period 
would not be able to solve Turkey's existing problems. 
  Yilmaz aid that debates over the establishment of a national 
coalition should be conducted after the local elections and 
noted that the fact that the issue had been brought up by a DYP 
member proved that the ruling party was pessimistic about its 
chances in the upcoming local elections. 
  Yilmaz said his party welcomed any proposal that would lead 
Turkey toward greater stability. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who returned to 
Turkey from her one-day visit to the besieged city of Sarajevo, 
found herself in the midst of another preelection dilemma again. 
This time she was faced with the possible resignation of former 
Interior Minister and current Bursa Deputy Mehmet Gazioglu.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--In its preparation for the upcoming March 27 
local elections, the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) has 
accelerated its efforts to represent itself as a party of the 
masses. The RP has not neglected the Alawis in its calls to 
various circles urging them to join the party. The RP's 
favorite targets in their recruitment efforts have been Turkey's 
fashion models, with women with modern or Western appearances 
coming in second and, finally, the Alawis following in third. 
Alawis, who have distanced themselves from Islamic circles for 
years, were stunned at Professor Izzettin Dogan's (a prominent 
Alawi leader known as "Dede" or grandfather) flirtation with the 
party and subsequent acceptance of the RP's party line. Dogan's 
move has elicited a harsh reaction from the Alawis as well as 
from other prominent figures. Some, unable to find another 
explanation for his actions, have even concluded that Dogan 
might actually have lost his mind and described his stance as a 
betrayal of the Alawis. 
  On the other hand, it is claimed that Nurettin Yildirim, an 
Alawi who entered the RP with great fanfare, does not enjoy 
prestige among the Alawis and that he only joined the RP because 
he had been rejected by all the other parties. The cloud of 
doubt cast over the sincerity of Yildirim's conversion to the RP 
ideology has led to allegations that the RP's Alawi recruits may 
be contrived. The fact that Yildirim, who has been completely 
ostracized by the Alawis for having joined the RP, has stated on 
various occasions that he has been the victim of an RP trap, is 
noteworthy. Yildirm had previously served as the secretary 
general for the now defunct Unity Party (BP) which was founded 
by Mustafa Timisi. It is alleged that Yildirim, who has also 
served in the Republican People's Party (CHP) as well as the 
Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), has been unable to achieve 
any noteworthy successes throughout his political career. RP 
Parliamentary Group Deputy Chairman Sevket Kazan said that his 
party refrained from laying down any prerequisites for joining 
the RP. Kazan said that the RP opened its doors to anyone who 
wanted to join. Pointing out that he and his colleagues did not 
discriminate between members of Sunni and Alawi Muslim sects, 
Kazan said that the RP was open to anyone who believed in God. 
He noted that the RP's grassroots constituency had not reacted 
negatively to growing Alawi membership in the party. 
  In reply to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS' question as to what he 
thought about the statements that Dogan, who claimed to speak on 
behalf of the Alawis, was no longer influential within or 
representative of the group, Kazan said: "This is a case of 
sour grapes. He was very valuable until he joined the RP. Has 
he suddenly become useless after having entered the RP?" Asked 
if his party would nominate Alawis in localities where they 
formed the dominant constituency, Kazan said: "Of course. The 
issue is being discussed among the party's rank and file and the 
most popular individual is nominated as a candidate from the RP." 
  When he was reminded of the fact that Alawi organizations 
were opposed to such an association with the RP, Kazan said 
that, on the contrary, his party was aware of the number of 
Alawis who supported a strong RP-Alawi relationship. 
  Although Kazan said that the RP would indiscriminately 
welcome anyone who wanted to join the party, Alawis have 
stressed that a move to the RP would constitute a betrayal to 
their own history. It has been claimed that Dogan -- who is 
known as an Alawi dede, or prominent leader -- has been 
attempting to cooperate with rightist parties since the late 
Turgut Ozal's administration. His apparent goal was to merge 
Alawis with the right wing within the framework of a 
"Turkish-Islam synthesis" and reportedly held several meetings 
with Ozal in order to achieve this vision. Dogan said that the 
idea of creating an alliance with the RP came up during a visit 
to Germany after having met with Ali Yuksel, who identified 
himself as the Seyhulislam (grand mufti). Among other issues, 
the alliance addresses the allocation of an Alawi budget by the 
Religious Affairs Directorate (Diyanet), the provision of sites 
for the observance of Alawi religious ceremonies and the 
assurance that Alawis will have unobstructed freedom to worship. 
  Dogan, who has been severely chastised by other Alawis for 
his move to the RP, reportedly has a history of establishing 
alliances with rightist parties, including the now defunct 
Nationalist Democracy Party (MDP), which was created by the 
military following the Sept. 12, 1980 coup and of which he was 
among the founding members. In addition to Dogan, who has been 
confronted by harsh criticism from Alawis and their 
organizations, it has been announced that Yildirim will be 
officially expelled from the Pir Sultan Abdal Association, a 
prominent Alawi organization. Murtaza Demir, the head of the 
association, has perhaps expressed the strongest opposition to 
reports of Dogan's collaboration with the RP. 
  In a joint statement made with Hikmet Ozkan -- a relative of 
one of the victims of the Sivas tragedy -- on behalf of the 
people who were burned to death in Sivas, Demir said he and his 
colleagues interpreted Dogan's stance as a "betrayal of the 
Alawis." Demir continued saying that despite the fact that it 
was well known that those who incited and participated in the 
Sivas massacre were pro-Shariah, it was noteworthy that Dogan, 
who identified himself as an Alawi Dede and was a scientist by 
training, had deliberately chosen to establish close ties with 
the RP. Demir said that Dogan's decision to join a party whose 
platform was hostile toward the republic and to the principles 
of secularism and democracy was Dogan's own business. However, 
Demir added that he and his colleagues did not understand why 
Dogan insisted on establishing these ties in the name of the 
Anatolian Alawis and within his role as an Alawi Dede. Demir 
maintained that Dogan's move into the pro-Shariah fold has led 
Alawism to become a subject of controversy. 
  Pointing out that he and other Alawis in the community 
regarded Dogan's association with the pro-Shariah party as an 
unpardonable offense, Demir said: "This is considered a 
betrayal of Anatolian Alawism. Alawis do not support 
pro-Shariah and undemocratic parties and organizations. They 
will not permit unqualified people to represent their personal 
interests." Yet another critic of Dogan's is Ahmet Sahin, the 
chairman of the Alawi Association for the Promotion of the Haci 
Bektas Culture. Sahin said that Alawis will simply ridicule 
Dogan if he attempts to claim to be representing Alawi interests 
as an RP member. He said that Dogan must have lost his mind if 
he believed that he was actually speaking on behalf of the Alawi 
community and added that Dogan's relationship with the RP is 
nothing but a betrayal to the Alawis. 
  Asked if he and his colleagues would support any political 
party during the local elections, Sahin said they would make 
their decision according to the qualifications of the 
candidates. But, he did say that they would be backing only 
progressive and democratic candidates. 
  Similarly, other Alawi organizations and publications also 
have criticized the establishment of ties with the RP, using 
almost the same style of speech and language. They went as far 
as to say that the formation of such an alliance could not even 
be possible. 
  According to figures from the State Institute of Statistics 
(DIE), there are 12 million Alawis in Turkey, or 20 percent of 
the overall population. However, it is a well-known fact that 
Alawis have refrained from identifying themselves with any one 
organization or party, although in the past they used to 
cooperate with the Democrat Party (DP). In subsequent years, 
they seem to have moved steadily toward the social democrat and 
radical leftist parties. In fact, the community's reluctance to 
rally around only one organization or party, despite their large 
numbers, has become a subject of criticism among many Alawis, 
especially those who recognize their potential for political 
power within the country. However, recently, Alawis have 
increasingly begun to join right- leaning parties and have 
quickly moved up their ranks to hold top leadership positions. 
During the past one or two years, Alawis have started to lean 
more and more toward organizations that emphasize the importance 
of religious or cultural unity rather than that of political 
unity. Many cultural organizations and publications have been 
founded to pursue this goal, such as the Pir Sultan Abdal 
Cultural Association, the Association for the Promotion of the 
Haci Bektas Veli Culture, and the Cem and Nefes magazines. 
  Meanwhile the social democratic parties have steadily been 
losing the support of the Alawi community, especially since the 
July 2, 1993 fundamentalist riot in Sivas, in which 33 
participants of the Pir Sultan Abdal Cultural Association's 
conference were burned to death in their Madimak Hotel. The 
fact that the SHP was a junior coalition partner in the 
government during the exhibition of gross negligence by security 
forces during the incident, has angered many Alawis and soured 
relations between them and the social democratic party. 
However, due to the upcoming local elections, Alawis have now 
begun to discuss the subject of which party they will support. 
Meanwhile, in order to announce their candidacies before the 
deadline, many Alawis have returned to the SHP and plan to run 
on that party's ticket during the elections. Some Alawis, 
particularly those who lost relatives during the Sivas riot, 
have protested against the SHP alliance, however, many within 
the SHP rank and file claim that Alawi opposition to the SHP is 
only temporary and will diminish over time. In fact, this 
reconciliation between the Alawis and the SHP did not need much 
time at all as, following reports of Alawi movements towards the 
RP, prominent Alawi figures have accelerated their contacts with 
the SHP. It has been reported that most of the Alawis chosen to 
be municipal candidates are those who have lost relatives during 
the Sivas incident. Alawis are continuing to hold meetings to 
determine their final positions for the local elections. 
Reportedly, Alawis will favor progressive-democratic 
candidates, particularly those selected by the SHP; independent 
candidates; or those nominated by other leftist parties, 
depending on their qualifications and the situation prevailing 
in the specific locality. In any case, it is expected that the 
RP will receive neither political support nor participation from 
Alawi voters. While Alawis emphasize this point, they also note 
that it is well known that those 100 or 200 Alawis who have 
opted to join the RP, have done so only after aggressive coaxing 
by members of the RP rank and file. 
  On the other hand, the RP has claimed that new Alawis 
continue to join their party and that the names of new Alawis 
members will be revealed during a ceremony in which the RP will 
announce its mayoral candidates for the upcoming elections. 
  However, those that join the RP can expect to face strong 
disapproval from the Confederation of Alawi Unions in Germany, 
one of the fiercest critics of any Alawi movement toward the RP. 
The federation has rejected any Alawi who has joined the RP. 
Ali Riza Gulcicek, who heads the Alawi Unions Confederation, 
said that those who had decided to join the ranks of the 
oppressors cannot expect to continue to represent the Alawi 
community. Culcicek said: "Cooperation of the RP--which is the 
culprit of the Sivas massacre, the defender of the massacre and 
hostile to secularism and democracy--with the Alawis is a 
betrayal of Alawi belief and tradition. At a time when we are 
still suffering from the freshness of our pain and when a gang 
of murderers sits in the halls of justice as heroes who have 
committed a massacre in the name of God, such cooperation is the 
equivalent of having taken part in the crime and of having 
vindicated the murderers of their despicable crime." In its 
statement, the federation maintained that cooperation between 
the RP and Alawis would not serve the establishment of an 
Alawi-Sunni brotherhood. It stressed that those who advocated 
the conversion of Alawis to Sunni religious ideology could not 
possibly have any Alawi links. While the confederation said 
that it did not insist that those who wanted to cooperate with 
the reactionary forces stop, the confederation did emphasize 
that it would be in their best interest to sever their links to 
the Alawi community altogether. 
  Stressing that Alawis would not cooperate the RP, the 
statement ended with the quote, "We do not want new Hiriz 
Pashas." During the Ottoman period Hizir Pasha, the then 
governor of Sivas, ordered the hanging of Pir Sultan Abdal, a 
renowned poet famous for his progressive ideology.

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>
  [Text] The NATO allies tonight issued an ultimatum to the 
warring factions in Bosnia, paving the way for the first 
military action in its history. After 12 hours of talks in 
Brussels, they agreed to launch air strikes against the Bosnian 
Serbs unless they withdraw from Sarajevo within 10 days. 
  The ultimatum, after tortuous negotiations and detailed 
consideration of all military and political implications for the 
West, requires a withdrawal out of the Bosnian capital of all 
heavy artillery by at least 13 miles, or the handing-over of 
weaponry to UN forces. 
  Tonight's historic declaration also threatens air strikes 
immediately if any shelling resumes in the wake of last 
weekend's street market massacre which killed 68 civilians. 
  Britain's Ambassador to NATO, John Weston, endorsed the move 
on the Government's behalf after assurances that the decision 
will not endanger three key goals: 

  -  The continuation of 
humanitarian aid supplies to the besieged citizens of 
Sarajevo. 
  -  The maintenance of the peace process. 
  -  The containment 
of the 22-month conflict within the borders of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Mr Weston had insisted that air strikes had to be seen to be 
of practical benefit and not just punitive retaliation in 
response to last Saturday's [5 February] atrocity. Only if air 
strikes can be justified as of practical military benefit to 
safeguard lives and help end the war can the NATO allies rely on 
support from elsewhere in the world. 
  The talks lasted much longer than expected. Greece insisted 
from the start that it did not want any involvement in the air 
strikes which, if they go ahead, are likely to be launched from 
Italy and from aircraft carriers. 
  Argument raged throughout the day over the precise terms of 
the ultimatum, with the Americans pressing for a tighter 
seven-day deadline and a requirement to withdraw heavy artillery 
20 miles. 
  An announcement from Sarajevo that the Bosnian Serbs were 
already preparing to pull back by noon tomorrow did not deter 
the NATO allies. Officials at NATO headquarters said such 
pledges could not be relied upon and would play little part in 
tonight's final decision. 
  The most reluctant signatories to tonight's agreement remain 
the British, Canadians and Greeks, and hopes remain high that 
the Serbs will fulfil all requirements and avert a NATO response 
which -- even with the best military soundings from on the spot 
-- could have unforseen consequences. 
  Britain's General Sir Michael Rose, who has just taken 
command of UN Forces in Bosnia, has been instrumental in 
supplying his political masters with the necessary strategic 
information for a tough political decision to be taken. 
  Britain's endorsement follows recognition that Saturday's 
massacre was "a turning point," in the words of Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
  [The declaration made clear there would be no extension of 
the deadline offered to the Serbs. 
  [It called for "the withdrawal or regrouping and placing 
under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] control, within 10 days, of 
heavy weapons (including tanks, artillery pieces, mortars, 
multiple rocket launchers, missiles and anti-aircraft weapons) 
of the Bosnian Serb forces located in an area within 20 km of 
the centre of Sarajevo and excluding an area within 2 km of the 
centre Pale." 
  [The allies also called on the Bosnian government to hand 
over its heavy weapons to UN control within the same deadline. 
  ["Ten days from 24 GMT February 10 heavy weapons of any of 
the parties found within the Sarajevon exclusion zone, unless 
controlled by UNPROFOR, will, along with their direct and 
essential military support facilities, be subject to NATO 
airstrikes which will be conducted in close co-ordination with 
the UN Secretary General and will be consistent with the North 
Atlantic Council's decisions of August 2 and 9, 1993." 
  [The declaration authorised air strikes, at UN request, 
against artillery or mortar positions in or around Sarajevo, 
from 0001, Friday, February 21, which were determined by 
UNPROFOR to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets 
in the city. 
  [At British insistence the final communique made direct 
reference to the need to secure a negotiated settlement, and 
pointed out "the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo could be a 
step toward the placing of Sarajevo under UN administration, in 
comformity with that plan." 
  [This met the British demand that air strikes must be in the 
context of improving the situation and not merely exacting 
revenge. 
  [The 13-paragraph document demanded "strict respect" for the 
safety of UNPROFOR and other UN and relief agency workers 
throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the right of free access 
for them to Sarajevo. 
  [The allies also expressed "indignation" at "indiscriminate 
attacks which have once again struck the people of Sarajevo in 
recent days." The siege of the city was continuing, "and that 
consequently the Bosnian Serbs bear the main responsibility for 
the tragic loss of civilian life that results from it." 
  [A key element in NATO deliberations was the longer term 
consequence of air strikes. 
  [Mr Hurd made clear earlier this week that "one day of 
satisfaction" was not justified without advance knowledge of 
what happens on the second day and the third day. 
  [Britain's troops on the ground in Sarajevo would be 
vulnerable if the Serbs launched retaliatory strikes. 
  [But NATO aircraft and spy satellites have been monitoring 
all Serb gun emplacements, ammunition dumps and command centres 
for months and believe they can isolate key targets if necessary 
and pre-empt any effective retaliation. 
  [Already eight RAF Jaguar fighter aircraft are on stand-by 
in 
Italy with a further four available in Britain, plus six Navy 
Sea Harriers from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal in the Adriatic. 
  [But the hope in the Foreign Office tonight was that the 
NATO 
threat would be enough to convince the Bosnian Serbs to ease 
their stranglehold and make life more tolerable for Sarajevo's 
beleaguered citizens while efforts towards a negotiated peace 
acceptable to all sides carry on.]

<F P=106> [Article signed SM/HS: "Meeting in Geneva of Countries </F>
Neighboring Former Yugoslavia. Satisfaction of European Union 
Mediator David Owen"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Geneva, 9 Feb (ATS) -- Mediator David Owen said on 
Wednesday [9 February] evening that he is very satisfied with 
the meeting of the foreign ministers of the seven countries 
neighboring the former Yugoslavia. The participants think that 
a peaceful solution must be found to end the war in Bosnia, the 
co-chairman of the International Conference on the Former 
Yugoslavia, said. 
  On the other hand, Mr. Owen was very skeptical about the new 
agreement reached between Serbs and Muslims in Sarajevo on 
Wednesday. This agreement makes provision for a cease-fire from 
noon Thursday and the withdrawal of the Serbian batteries to 
positions on the hills which overlook the Bosnian capital. In 
this connection, the European Union mediator pointed out that 
numerous agreements had already been reached in the past, 
without ever being respected. 
  He pointed out that the Geneva meeting was the first meeting 
around one table by all the foreign ministers of the Balkan 
states. The discussion related to the consequences of a possible 
lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia. It also examined the 
effects of the economic embargo imposed by the United Nations on 
the new Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
  The Italian foreign minister explained that all the states 
present in Geneva had declared their agreement on maintaining 
the economic embargo. The states represented in Geneva were 
Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania. 
Turkey was invited but was not present. It apparently decided 
not to attend at the last minute, arguing that the meeting had 
little chance of producing practical results, according to some 
diplomatic sources.

<F P=106> [Eric Frey report: "Bosnia Conference With Neighboring </F>
States"] 
  [Text] For the first time since the outbreak of the 
Balkans conflict, the neighboring states of the former 
Yugoslavia were officially involved in the search for a peaceful 
settlement on Wednesday [9 February]. At the invitation of the 
international mediators Lord Owen and Thorwald Stoltenberg, 
representatives of eight states met for a "private" conference 
in Geneva, convened at short notice. 
  Apart from Austria's Foreign Minister Alois Mock, the 
foreign 
ministers of Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania, and 
the Hungarian deputy foreign minister attended the meeting. The 
Turkish foreign minister canceled his participation at the last 
minute. 
  Officially, only economic issues -- the impact of the 
sanctions on the remaining Yugoslavia and economic 
reconstruction after a peace agreement -- were on the agenda. 
Yet observers in Geneva noted a deeper political background: 
Owen and Stoltenberg might try to induce some neighboring 
countries with closer relations with Serbia, such as Greece and 
Bulgaria, to exert political pressure on Belgrade. 
  The meeting was dominated by the NATO consultations on a 
military strike against Serbian positions in Sarajevo. Mock 
vehemently supported a military intervention by the United 
Nations and supported the most recent French initiative for air 
strikes. 
  Instead of merely adopting resolutions, the world community 
must effectively implement human rights, Mock stressed before 
the beginning of the talks: "Power without rights leads to 
tyranny, but rights without power leads to ridicule. An 
aggressor simply does not take the 25th warning and the 30th 
resolution of the Security Council seriously any longer." 
  Mock stressed the same issues in a speech to the UN Human 
Rights Commission, which is currently convening in Geneva. He 
welcomed the quick nomination of a UN human rights commissioner, 
decided at the human rights conference in Vienna in June 1993. 
  During a short meeting with UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees 
Sadako Ogata, Mock endorsed the creation of a new relief 
organization that should be jointly run by Muslims, Croats, and 
Serbs.

<F P=106> [Samo Kobenter editorial: "Better Late Than Never"] </F>
  [Text] The West has finally -- let us hope that it was not 
too late -- decided to adopt a tougher stance vis-a-vis the 
Bosnian Serbs. It became clear on Wednesday [9 February] how 
sensitively the besiegers react to this language. When signs 
increased that the West was serious this time, they wanted to 
withdraw their heavy artillery quickly from the hills 
surrounding the capital and without demanding anything in 
return. This is more than the peace mediators have achieved in 
the past two years. 
  Still, one should not delude oneself now that peace will 
break out in the foreseeable future. Irrespective of the 
situation in Sarajevo, a strong Serbian offensive is under way 
in central Bosnia. Unimpressed by the threats of NATO, the 
Serbian aggressors tighten the noose in the Tuzla basin, thus 
threatening about 1 million people. The Serbs are clearly 
impressed by the position of NATO, which, however, cannot stop 
the immense war machinery of the Serbs. 
  Determination and good political judgment are now more 
urgently needed than ever before -- not least out of 
consideration for Russia's policy that decided to strictly 
reject a military intervention in Bosnia across all ideological 
camps. One can hardly assume that the West, after its long 
hesitation in the Balkans crisis, wants to risk a serious 
conflict with the pan-Slavic bloc at this particular point. The 
next 10 days might become a test that will go far beyond the 
Bosnian issue. Basically, what was to be prevented by all means 
has now become a political reality: The Balkans has become the 
biggest burden for the newly defined relationship between Russia 
and the West.

<F P=106> [Axel Buyse commentary: "Pondering"] </F>
  [Text] It is the Bosnian Serbs who have held Sarajevo in a 
pincer since April 1992. They were the first to reach for their 
weapons. Their artillery pounds the city virtually every day. 
Scarcely a day goes by without more victims falling because of 
the civil war. 
  But every time a shot hits home, and the international 
community is forced to make a move, these same Serb leaders 
scream their innocence like the murdered victims and point to 
the Muslims as the guilty ones. Then mention is once again made 
of the "fundamentalism" that from time to time scores a direct 
hit against its own side in order to keep international sympathy 
for its cause warm. 
  Nobody can rule out with 100 percent certainty that there is 
not some Muslim commander who is tempted to work out such a 
devilishly Machiavellian plan, but if Radovan Karadzic and the 
other Serb leaders want to be absolved once and for all of all 
blame and "unjust accusations," then there is a simple solution 
open to them: They can withdraw their heavy artillery from 
around the city. Then the international community can translate 
its cries of indignation into deeds: It can reinforce the UN 
troops on the ground so that they can supervise a demilitarized 
zone around the city in order to prevent the "balance" between 
these Serbs and the Bosnian Government Army from being broken up 
too suddenly. If that were to happen there, or on other fronts, 
it would lead to fresh outbreaks of violence. 
  The rescue of Sarajevo -- even if it is a temporary and 
local 
solution -- could give new impetus to peace talks for all of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but anyone who believes that the Bosnian 
Serbs will give up their siege without a struggle must still 
believe in Santa Claus. All the parties in the Yugoslav 
conflict still place their exclusive trust in the power derived 
from weapons. 
  For this reason, there was a great deal to be said for the 
French proposal to put an ultimatum to the guilty parties in 
this and other concrete cases. That is a step toward 
escalation, and the people who take such action should be well 
aware of the dangers it entails. However there is an awfully 
great chance that the Bosnian parties will themselves initiate 
this escalation, and will do so directly at a higher and just as 
dangerous a level -- at least internationally. 
  So far the international community has been piling one 
blunder on top of another. Or better put: Time after time it 
has missed the boat when opportunities to have a positive 
influence on the conflict presented themselves. That was 
already the case before the weapons started doing the talking in 
Slovenia and Croatia, and before the situation in Bosnia turned 
into war. 
  Since the outside world does not seem capable of following a 
sufficiently preventative policy, it will be forced -- sooner or 
later -- to reach for military threats. That is the price of 
the present comfort and detachment. The stronger Russian 
nationalism grows, the weaker becomes the West's grip on the 
Serbs. And this is happening at a time when in other places in 
the Balkans new conflicts could break out at any time which 
would immediately plunge the entire region into flames.

  [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellery Minister Friedrich 
Bohl is relying on the pressure put on the Serbs through the 
latest decisions by NATO ambassadors to have an effect. He 
expressed the hope that this will make it possible to implement 
the European Union peace plan, Bohl said on ARD TV's morning 
news program today. Peace will otherwise have to be brought 
about through military means. Bonn has actively worked for a 
unified NATO position "behind the scenes," he stated. 
  The Federal Republic cannot itself participate in military 
actions for historical and constitutional reasons, but will give 
the decisions made in Brussels its full "political and moral 
support," he said. Bohl rejected the idea that Europe would be 
on the brink of war after possible air strikes against artillery 
positions in Sarajevo. To draw parallels between 1914 and 1994 
is "false" and does not take into account the completely 
different situation now, he asserted.

The focal points of the rallies were in North Rhine-Westphalia, 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, and Hesse. According to the trade union, 
about 119,000 metalworkers participated in the actions. This 
Thursday and Friday the IG-Metall will not be able to keep its 
warning strikes up to the same extent, since in many regions of 
western Germany Karneval is being celebrated, IG-Metall Chairman 
Zwickel said. On the weekend the leaders of the employers and

  [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative in Cyprus, today had a new 
meeting with President Glavkos Kliridhis within the framework of 
negotiations to prepare the proximity talks on the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
  Entering the Presidential Palace, Feissel said things are 
proceeding normally, adding that he does not expect any 
difficulties. The goal of the UN official's meetings is to 
prepare an agenda and determine the points that each side 
considers crucial in implementing the CBM's. 
  According to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation's [CyBC] 
information, Kliridhis said the key-points are access to 
Famagusta's fenced-off area, the safety of the Greek Cypriots 
who will return to their homes in that area, and the travel 
documents that Turkish Cypriots will use at Nicosia Airport if 
and when it reopens. 
  Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, government spokesman 
Ioannis Kasoulidhis, Deputy Minister to the President Pandelis 
Kouros, and UN political adviser John Paul Kavanagh participated 
in the meeting. Feissel will have another meeting with Turkish 
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas tomorrow. He also met Denktas 
yesterday. 
  Leaving the Presidential Palace a short time ago, Feissel 
said the agenda of the proximity talks has been finalized, 
adding that it contains six topics. The UN envoy said he will 
inform the UN secretary general that the two sides have agreed 
on the agenda. He added that the proximity talks will begin on 
17 February, as scheduled. 
  Feissel confirmed a CyBC report braodcast yesterday that Joe 
Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in 
Cyprus, will arrive in Cyprus next Tuesday [15 February] and 
will not be accompanied by UN experts.

<F P=106> [Article signed CB: "Maltese Prime Minister Hopes For </F>
Negotiations with EU this Year"] 
  [Text] Maltese Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami hopes to 
be able to start formal negotiations this year on joining the 
European Union (EU). "No member state is fully opposed and the 
United Kingdom and Germany have already showed their support," 
Fenech Adami said yesterday in a meeting with several 
journalists. The Maltese prime minister was in Brussels for 
talks with the European Commission. He also had a meeting with 
Prime Minister Dehaene. Malta applied for membership of what was 
the European Community on 16 July 1990. 
  Fenech Adami said that the required reforms, like the 
introduction of value added tax, the abolition of capital 
controls or reduced customs duties, have either been implemented 
or are about to be approved by Parliament. 
  The membership of this small state located in the 
Mediterranean Sea would not pose many economic or budgetary 
problems for the EU, which has 345 million inhabitants at 
present. This figure would even increase to 370 million 
inhabitants if Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria joined. The 
country consists of three small islands with a total of 360,000 
inhabitants. The reforms requested are intended simply to 
prevent membership becoming too great a shock for the Maltese 
economy. Nor does the domestic political situation offer any 
reason for disquiet to the Union. 
  The way the Union functions would be the biggest problem 
arising from Maltese membership. As a small country with little 
international experience and a small diplomatic corps and civil 
service, it is doubtful whether Malta would be able to take on 
the six-monthly presidency. Out of the present member states, 
only Luxembourg has so few inhabitants, but it has been involved 
in European integration right from the start. 
  A modification to the rules will be discussed at the planned 
inter-governmental conference in 1996. However, many will be 
reluctant to start new institutional discussions after the 
difficulties with the Maastricht Treaty. But according to 
Fenech Adami, it was senseless to avoid this discussion and 
Malta's application should not suffer on these grounds. He 
rejected a possible link between the applications of Malta and 
Cyprus or postponement, should the talks with Norway, Sweden, 
Finland, and Austria become stuck. 
  Language will in any case not be an obstacle. Malta is 
prepared to use English rather than Maltese in the Union, so 
that the Union would not have to add another language.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Addressing a ground-breaking 
ceremony in Izmir, Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy 
prime minister, said that in the wake of the latest Serbian 
attack in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Turkey made requests in NATO for 
an intervention. He added: 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] Those who are our friends, 
those who are our allies, if they want to continue with their 
friendship and alliance with Turkey, this is their chance. They 
must take it. They must decide to intervene on the Serbian 
artillery positions in the hills around Sarajevo. They must end 
this massacre. Turkey will assess this. It might assess it 
today or in the future. If Turkey's friendship, the Turkish 
people's friendship, is important for the Western forces, they 
have an opportunity to show it. Let them show their friendship. 
In turn, we will show our friendship. From now on, we will 
display this determined stand regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Excerpt] The crisis in Bosnia is becoming increasingly 
complicated and packed full of threats. The NATO ultimatum has 
provoked a furious Serbian reaction. In Belgrade extremists 
such as ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj have even threatened to 
bomb Italy and other NATO countries, as well as the blue helmets 
deployed in Bosnia. 
  Defense Minister Fabbri, who telephoned U.S. Defense 
Secretary Perry, regards the threats as groundless; thus, the 
situation is very tense on the very day that the cease-fire has 
come into force in Sarajevo. [sentence as heard] [passage

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 14 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation is insisting that heavy weapons of the Bosnian 
Serbs besieging Sarajevo be placed under full and effective 
United Nations control, a NATO spokesman said here Monday [14 
February]. 
  Both the U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry and his French 
counterpart Francois Leotard have warned there will be no 
extension to the 10-day deadline set by the alliance for the 
withdrawal of heavy guns. 
  The NATO spokesman was reacting to reports from the Bosnian 
capital that the United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) was 
bending to conditions put by the Bosnian Serb military on how to 
place their artillery under UN control. 
  "For us, control means that these weapons are sequestered 
(by 
UNPROFOR) so they cannot be used," the NATO spokesman said. 
  Last Wednesday NATO issued a 10-day ultimatum for the 
Bosnian 
Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons at least 20 kilometres 
(12.5 miles) from the outskirts of the Bosnian capital, or place 
them under UN control. 
  The ultimatum expires at 2400 GMT on Sunday night. If it is 
not met, NATO has said it will launch air strikes against the 
heavy weapons emplacements. The NATO spokesman said there would 
be no extension of the deadline. 
  But the Bosnian Serb chief of staff, Manojlo Milovanovic, 
said at the weekend that Bosnian Moslem troops would have to be 
placed under UN control as a condition for handing over control 
of the Serb heavy weaponry. 
  In apparent defiance of the NATO ultimatum, he said his 
forces intended to keep their weapons in place, but under UN 
surveillance and only if the Moslem infantry was also put under 
UN control. 
  On Sunday, the British deputy commander of UNPROFOR forces 
in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lieutenant-Colonel Simon Shadbolt, said the 
concept of "control" did not mean the Bosnian Serbs would have 
to move their weapons. 
  "There are different ways of controlling things than to 
physically put them inside barbed wire," he said. 
  But the NATO spokesman said Shadbolt's interpretation was 
too 
loose and that simple monitoring of the weapons was not good 
enough "because this has never stopped the weapons being used." 
  He added that NATO had its own air surveillance intelligence 
about the artillery emplacements. "We have our own means of 
checking up," the spokesman said. 
  A British official said there were cautious grounds for 
optimism despite the slow pace of the weapons hand-over, because 
the ceasefire around Sarajevo was holding. "So far so good, but 
we haven't got very far yet," he said.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with French Defense Minister Francois </F>
Leotard and -- by live hook-up -- with UN Commander General Jean 
Cot in Zagreb, by announcer Anne Sinclair; program includes 
recorded message by Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija 
Izetbegovic, in French -- from the "Sept dur Sept" program] 
  [Excerpts] [Sinclair] Good evening. Last Saturday [5 
February], right in the middle of the market in Sarajevo, a 
shell left 68 dead and 200 wounded. It took this carnage, the 
nausea and disgust of public opinion, for the determination of 
the West to take hold. At the initiative of France and 
encouraged by the United States, NATO gave the Serbs an 
ultimatum to lift the blockade on Sarajevo. Mr. Defense 
Minister [Francois Leotard], good evening. We will be taking 
stock of the situation shortly with General Cot, who will be 
with us, and this is very exceptional, in a two way link-up from 
Zagreb, and with Isabelle Baillancourt, our special 
representative in Sarajevo. But we immediately have a question 
that is in everyone's mind. Have we started a process which 
carries with it the risk of extending the war in Europe? 
  [Leotard] It is because of the very existence of this risk 
that we have been there, since the beginning, since 1991. We 
are there because Europe, and the French first of all, realized 
that, starting from that region, there could be a chain of 
events -- which history has already shown us, for that matter -- 
a chain of events dangerous for all of Europe. It is for that 
reason. So we have had the risk of expanding [of the war] up to 
now, and we are still facing it. In other words, we are 
intervening because there is that hypothesis of the war 
spreading to the north and to the south -- toward Krajina in the 
north, we will come to this in a while -- and toward the south, 
the Muslim areas in the south. It is because of these risks 
that we are there. 
  [Sinclair] But is the process started by NATO -- we are 
going 
to come back to this at great length because the program is 
dealing exclusively with this subject -- is the process started 
by NATO this week, is there a risk that we are taking on? 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Leotard] It is important to know that, in this part of the 
world, there are no policies that do not involve risk. So we 
have to look at this situation very seriously, first of all, and 
with courage and lucidity. Seriously, because people have been 
killed. I remind you that 200,000 people have died throughout 
the territory of the former Yugoslavia, there are 4 million 
refugees, tens of thousands of people who have been displaced, 
who are living in enclaves today. With courage, because I think 
we have to assess and accept a certain number of risks, which 
come from our firm attitude. And then, of course, with lucidity 
-- aware that the situation is extraordinarily complex and that 
it involves methods on our part, and on the part of all 
Europeans for that matter. 
  [Sinclair] So before further discussion of the matter, 
Francois Leotard, the pictures. Let us immediately look again 
at the film of the week. [passage omitted] Francois Leotard, 
we will look at things in order, and first of all, of course, 
the ultimatum. Why did it not seem possible yesterday, or even 
seemed irresponsible, as Bernard-Henri Levy, the Abbe Pierre, 
and Bernard Kouchner were told, why has it suddenly become 
possible this week? 
  [Leotard] I think there are several things to be said in 
response to your question. First, France itself, especially 
since April: We have kept asking for a certain number of 
international measures. We are not alone in this matter. We 
belong to coalitions: Europe, NATO, and of course the United 
Nations. So we have asked for intervention several times within 
these organizations. [passage omitted] 
  The second reason is that bit by bit attacks on the UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR] have increased. So we were were 
getting bogged down. The reason for our presence was to give 
humanitarian aid, and that aid was itself being hindered. 
  The third reason is that there was a disagreement, it is 
true 
and I must say it here, about the very idea of what was meant by 
air strikes. We have heard a lot of unclear or vague things -- 
this is normal in discussion. We have always asked for air 
support -- that is to say, an air presence -- to enable aid 
tasks to be carried out. Others have said we have to go further, 
we have to strike systematically, and sometimes in depth, 
sometimes even in Serbia itself, against those fighting us. But 
that is not our mandate. We have not declared war on one of the 
three factions. But we are going to declare war [as heard]. So 
you have to realize that what was difficult yesterday because 
we, France, were not understood, is better accepted today, 
because the French position, in particular at the last NATO 
meeting, was accepted by the Americans, and understood by our 
allies. [passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] Will you designate the aggressor today? 
  [Leotard] It is more complicated than it was yesterday. Of 
course, it is the Serbs besieging the town in Sarajevo, for 
example. We have to say things clearly. Elsewhere, as you will 
see, it is Muslim Bosnians surrounding Croat zones, so it has 
become more complex. 
  [Sinclair] But you are not equating them? Because the 
expression the belligerents has always been... 
  [Leotard, interrupting] No, I am not equating them. What 
happened in the beginning was the desire of Greater Serbia, of 
the Serbian leaders, to spread their influence, to gain 
territory by violence. That is what we should never have 
accepted. Never have accepted. 
  We must tell those people who keep saying that we must 
withdraw, I mean to say, sometimes for a minimum, minor, modest 
effort, at any rate at the start, one can prevent a larger 
catastrophe. And this is absolutely the thesis we are trying to 
develop. Let's try to stop the war now, because tomorrow we 
won't be able to stop it any more. 
  [Sinclair] Saying to oneself at the same time, let's stop it 
now but, perhaps, we could have stopped it earlier. 
  [Leotard] Perhaps we could have stopped it earlier. [passage 
omitted] We must stick to the same course, because we are 
involved in a trial of strength, with people who today respect 
only threats. So we must carry these threats through. [passage 
omitted] 
  This is just to show that the existing forces, including 
French planes, are constantly taking photographs which we need 
and targets have already been established. Everyone must know 
we have all this and we will use it. 
  [Sinclair] So when we talk about bombing artillery pieces, 
it 
is really these artillery pieces here that we see [points to 
map] and which are approximately how many, 250 or 300? 
  [Leotard] Now, between 250 and 300, if you add pieces that 
are really heavy artillery mortars of 120 mm or mortars of 80 
mm, which are very hard to detect because they are small 
weapons. And it was probably a 120 mortar, you remember, which 
caused the drama, the tragedy, of the market of Markale. 
  [Sinclair] General Cot, you are in Zagreb, live from Zagreb 
with us. Thank you very much for being with us. We can see you 
and we can hear you. On the ground, the Serbs have timidly 
started to hand pieces of artillery over to the UNPROFOR. For 
you, is that encouraging or, on the contrary, do you think that 
this is not enough? Two days ago, 13 pieces of artillery were 
reportedly handed over. Today, for instance, nothing has come 
as yet. Are you rather optimistic or pessimistic? 
  [Cot] If you allow me, before I go into figures concerning 
guns, I would like to tell you what I think about what the 
minister has just said. I think that the tragedy of 5 February 
was a genuine trauma on the ground, as I could see for myself 
the following day, and throughout the world. 
  Two initiatives have emerged. The first, about which you 
talked at length, if I understood well, is that of NATO. The 
other is what is happening on the ground, and as early as the 
following day, through the negotiations we conducted 
immediately: we managed to obtain a cease-fire, as you know, 
before NATO's decision, and that cease-fire is being heeded. We 
also managed to have observers sent there and to start gathering 
pieces of artillery. 
  I think, I sincerely hope, that these two initiatives will 
be 
complementary, and I do hope that the 120 mm shell on the market 
place could be the beginning of a process leading to the 
opposite of 1914 Sarajevo, if you like. An example closer to us 
could be that of Ouvea [site of clashes between police and 
freedom fighters in New Caledonia in 1988]. 
  As you rightly put it, it seems to me that when too much 
becomes too much, on the ground, one must understand that it is 
necessary to break out of this absurd situation. I believe that 
NATO's initiative, which I support, of course, and the one we 
took on the ground, that is continuing to negotiate in a 
determined fashion, are complementary. 
  [Sinclair] Negotiations on the ground are continuing. 
General Soubirou, a French general and Michael Rose's deputy, 
was in Pale today to negotiate with the Serbs. So what has come 
out of the negotiations today? Can you tell us? Are we in a 
process where we are moving towards the handover of Serb 
artillery to your forces, the UNPROFOR forces, or is there a 
feeling that things are getting very bogged down? 
  [Cot] Yes, I think we have not started off so badly, since, 
as I told you, the cease-fire has been respected for three days. 
But it is true that the items that we have collected so far are 
only a minute fraction of the total that the Serbs have, since 
we have today 20 antiaircraft guns from the Serb side, and 10 
items from the Bosnian side. But I think we will continue, and 
we must certainly keep up pressure, and even step it up. That 
is why I went to see General Mladic, who is the commander of the 
Serbs, in the mountains of northwest Bosnia yesterday, and got 
him to agree to come to Sarajevo next Tuesday, 15 February, to 
the airport, and I am going to ask General Delic, his 
counterpart with the Bosnians, to come too, because I think that 
the level of negotiations, headed at the moment by General 
Soubirou, is too low, and I am glad to have got these two chiefs 
to meet. I will be there too, with General Rose, and we really 
intend to keep up strong pressure. 
  [Sinclair] General, people remember your anger when you 
said: We are ready for military intervention, and are sorry 
that we don't have the means to respond when the UN forces are 
attacked, and even spoke about your soldiers being humiliated. 
Does the situation seem clearer to you today? Do you feel that 
everyone fits their role better? 
  [Cot] Yes, I also said other things, but that is mainly what 
has been remembered. Let me tell you that this morning I 
received the decision by the Secretary General, Mr. 
Butrus-Ghali, to delegate to Mr Akashi on the ground the right 
to take the decision on possible use of air support throughout 
the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so I must be satisfied with 
what I have done and I think... 
  [Sinclair, interrupting] Would that be done, General... 
  [Cot] ...this is more in keeping with the needs of the force 
that has got itself into a more and more difficult situation, as 
Mr. Leotard was saying. 
  [Sinclair] Would that be done at your request? That's to 
say, would it be at the request of UNPROFOR that it would be 
submitted to Mr. Akashi and then he would authorize the strike? 
How would it happen exactly? 
  [Cot] That is indeed just what would happen. I would ask for 
the use of aircraft, whether throughout Bosnia, as I have just 
said, or for the case of Sarajevo today, and I would submit this 
request to Mr. Akashi, who, taking into account those factors 
that come under his competence, would make the decision himself, 
which would make it possible to save a great deal of time. 
That's to say, we could reduce it from about three hours -- 
that's the timescale we have found through our exercises up to 
now -- to about half of that, or even less. So it is a very 
important decision. 
  [Sinclair] A question to Francois Leotard, and also to you, 
General Cot: What will happen if the withdrawal is incomplete, 
that is if we see that each day, a small contingent -- if there 
are any at all -- is handed over to UNPROFOR, and if, at the end 
of the day, when the ultimatum expires, we have 80 or 120 pieces 
of artillery out of the 250. What will we do? What will we not 
do? 
  [Leotard] It is necessary for all, including the Serbs, to 
know that we are extremely determined and that we intend to 
succeed in this operation. If the conditions set by the 
decision of Brussels are not met, the term used in the 
resolution is: The batteries will be exposed to attack. It 
will be up to us to decide when and how the attacks, the strikes 
take place. 
  [Sinclair] That is to say, possibly, an extension of the 
ultimatum? 
  [Leotard] No, on the contrary. NATO's decision points out 
very clearly -- and it is exceptional for this type of decision 
-- that the deadline would not be extended. Consequently, on 
the evening of the 20th, everybody should know what can be 
expected. It will be up to [pauses] ...of course, we are not 
[pauses] ...having said that, what General Cot says is true: We 
are not just outside, we are also inside the site, the theater, 
as we say. There will be close cooperation with the forces on 
the ground, General Rose, General Soubirou, General Cot, of 
course, who will direct things, and this cooperation will enable 
us to see how ground troops move toward the batteries, the 
orders they receive, the reactions of those who may not want to 
obey them, and then the decisions to be taken. But nobody 
should question our determination. It should be obvious for 
those who are listening to us. 
  [Sinclair] General, something that people are a bit worried 
about here is that Serbian weapons are being deposited in the 
barracks at Lukavica, in other words in a zone under Serbian 
control. There have already been precedents when Serbs have 
taken over weapons very close to them, left for them. Shouldn't 
these locations be under the control of the NATO forces, and in 
any case out of reach of the Serb forces? 
  [Cot] Yes, but all things are possible. Even if they are all 
withdrawn from beyond the radius of 20 km, you could say that 
they could be brought back later. I think this is a first step. 
And I must say that what has been decided does not deal only 
with a withdrawal beyond a radius of 20 km, but also regrouping 
within the radius of 20 km, as long as the regrouping is under 
UN control. 
  So I think these are reasonable guarantees. 
  [Sinclair] Today the Serbs, in particular General 
Milovanovic, who is the chief of staff of the Serb forces in 
Bosnia, are asking you to monitor the Muslim infantry in 
Sarajevo. Might you consider this? Was this in the agreement? 
That's to say, they are asking for another, extra guarantee? 
  [Cot] This is something different. First of all the pieces 
of heavy artillery surrounding Sarajevo have to be regrouped or 
pulled back, as we have just said. That is our first aim. Of 
course there is no question of the Muslim forces taking 
advantage of this to occupy the territory that will thus have 
been liberated. That is where the interplay of forces on the 
ground is extremely complex. It is like a game of spillikins in 
a war situation. That's to say, you have to pick up one by one 
the instruments of death around Sarajevo and, at the same time, 
ensure the physical presence of soldiers on the ground, reassure 
the population -- which General Rose did yesterday, going out 
onto the streets, and which we, our soldiers, do every day, and 
at the same time see that those inside the siege don't benefit 
from it, because that would again be seen as a factor of 
violence or aggression -- that they don't benefit from the 
situation in order to regain ground which will have to be 
regarded from a diplomatic or political point of view. 
  What is important in what we were just saying is that there 
is no military solution, properly speaking. I hope we will 
speak about the peace plan, political and diplomatic solutions, 
but everyone is well aware that we are in a situation where 
there are no military solutions, properly speaking. 
  [Sinclair] A last question, perhaps, general: It has been 
said very often that air strikes are not of much use if there 
are not enough men on the ground to occupy the positions 
formerly held by the Serb forces, as we were saying. Has 
anything changed in this line of thinking, or was it wrong, or 
are you saying today: We do indeed need more men, and you are 
asking for more men? 
  [Cot] I think the scenario you have just described, namely 
that we make air strikes and we have to reoccupy the ground, has 
been too strongly influenced by the Gulf war, where by and large 
that was the scenario. But here, indeed we don't have the means 
to reconquer in the military sense what has been got rid of on 
the Serb side. I don't think that's the aim, actually. We 
don't have the means to do it and, as Mr. Leotard said, we are 
not in a war situation. We are there to take over control of 
these weapons. I am sure that the pressure is strong enough for 
this to be done, but I don't think we can talk about military 
operations, about reconquering ground that has in a way been 
cleared by air strikes. This is a line of thinking that does 
not accord with the nature of the force, nor with its mandate as 
Mr. Leotard said just now, at the beginning of the program. 
  [Sinclair] Francois Leotard, I would like to ask you the 
same question, because it often was an argument used by 
politicians, including the present government, who said: We, 
France, have done our best, but there are not enough of us on 
the ground because other countries have not followed us 
sufficiently. 
  [Leotard] Yes, of course. I would like to comment on what 
General Cot has just said. He is totally right. We are in a 
situation which is the exact reverse of the Gulf war. May I 
remind you that during the Gulf war we wore khaki, if I may put 
it this way, not white and blue. We had a front, a genuine 
front. There was an opponent, a named opponent, and so on. 
Here, we are not in a war situation. We have not declared war 
on anyone. We are painted in blue, i.e. we are men of peace, 
and, in fact, the situation of Sarajevo is reproduced elsewhere, 
with other elements, with different ethnic and religious 
elements. I believe that it is necessary to be aware of this. 
  To the precise question you are asking, namely, will more 
men 
be necessary to control the 20 km zone, unfortunately, the 
answer is yes. I say unfortunately, because we have made a 
significant effort and we do not intend to step up that effort 
as long as others don't. Of course, military officers themselves 
say some 1,500 men should be added to bring the situation more 
under control. Again, we must bear in mind that we are not in a 
situation of military conflict, which makes things very complex 
indeed. 
  [Sinclair] A last question, General Cot, and I will let you 
go. Do you think that the Serbs' capacity for retaliation has 
been overestimated, or is it significant, even after air 
strikes, and are you worried for civilians and your soldiers? 
  [Cot] We have not over [pauses] ...we know the capacity of 
the Serbs. The Serbs have inherited the material of the 
Yugoslav People's Army, as you know. I don't know how we could 
estimate today what would be left of the guns after air strikes, 
this would take us too far into the debate, but I think that the 
Serbs have the means to retaliate, indeed, not only around 
Sarajevo, but throughout Bosnia, especially against humanitarian 
workers, which is another matter. There is no doubt that there 
is a contradiction there which will have to be assumed, between 
the mandate in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is essentially, if not 
totally, a humanitarian one, and the new attitude which we will 
take on. It is a genuine problem. 
  [Leotard] We must understand, Anne Sinclair, if you allow 
me, 
that on the very day these air strikes begin -- if they ever 
begin -- the airport will be closed. At the moment, 80 percent 
of the food reaching Sarajevo comes from the airport. We would 
be in a totally different situation, and a very difficult one to 
manage. At the moment, there are some 3,000 men there, 
including more than 2,000 French soldiers. It would be a 
complex situation. 
  [Sinclair] General, thanks a lot for being with us live from 
Zagreb. I let you go back to your men, your battalions, your 
mission which will become very complicated over the next few 
weeks. Thanks a million for being there, and good luck. 
  [Cot] Thank you, Madame. 
  [Sinclair] Before talking about the Bosnian problem as a 
whole, I would like to play for you a recording of Alija 
Izetbegovic, the president of the country, of this country that 
has suffered too much, as was said yesterday at the opening of 
the Lillehammer Olympic Games. He does not speak often; he has 
not spoken since the ultimatum. He agreed to do so for the 
"Sept sur Sept" team out there, and he did it in French: 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording; Izetbegovic speaks in halting 
French, reading from a script] Dear French friends. The France 
that fought in the resistance has just shown Sarajevo the path 
of honor and courage. I thank the French authorities and the 
French people for this. Alas! It has taken tens of thousands 
of deaths for the European conscience to wake up. I hope that 
this is not just a burst of indignation, and that from now on 
Europe will defend in full one of the peoples which make it up, 
and the values which lie at its roots. 
  But if an ultimatum has been issued to the Serbs to withdraw 
their guns, you must know that the siege of Sarajevo has not 
been lifted. Five metres, 500 metres from here is Mount 
Trebevic. For two years sharpshooters have been killing 
children, women, pedestrians, a whole innocent people, every day. 
  Will the Serbs be allowed, in exchange for the withdrawal of 
their guns, to continue to surround 300,000 men and women? A 
first step has been taken, but it does not give us back our 
freedom. More steps need to be taken, in Sarajevo and 
elsewhere, to enable us to live again at last. 
  Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica, Maglaj, Tesanj, Mostar and the 
other towns have been besieged and starved for months; Tuzla is 
being shelled. Is Sarajevo going to be saved, and not those 
towns? 
  If Europe, and the international community, really make the 
aggressor retreat from around Sarajevo, will they stop there? 
Will they consider that they have done enough for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? We in Bosnia-Herzegovina are resisting a 
new fascism. This curse is not threatening my country alone. 
Tomorrow it can invade Europe and the former USSR. Will the 
Serbs obtain by negotiation what they were unable to grab by 
war? The end of Bosnia, recognition of their conquests, and 
absolution for their crimes? 
  French friends, I ask you to continue your support for the 
freedom of Sarajevo and of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole. Thank 
you. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Leotard] I mean to say that the other Europeans, the 
international community should pull their weight as much as 
France. We now have nearly 9,000 French soldiers throughout the 
theater, if I can say that, on the Adriatic, on the Danube, in 
Zagreb, in Sarajevo. We are the country that has contributed 
most. 
  [Sinclair] Nine thousand out of... 
  [Leotard] Out of nearly 30,000 now. There are 30 nations 
there. So, we are the country that has pulled its weight most. 
The others must pull their weight too. We have asked for this, 
from the United States, of course, but also and above all, from 
the Europeans. It's up to the Europeans to understand that it 
is partly their future which is at stake on this territory. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Leotard] And then, Tuzla, where we are trying and we are 
hoping to open the airport, which would allow humanitarian aid 
to reach the north of Bosnia. And there, also, the Serbs are 
opposing this for the time being. I personally hope that we can 
also have the air protection force used around Tuzla, so that we 
can reopen the airport of Tuzla and get humanitarian aid into 
that part of Bosnia. [passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] Could we make the following concession to the 
Bosnians: grant them, in a revised peace plan [pauses] ...this 
is what the Americans advocate, that is, the revision of the 
peace plan in favor of the Bosnians, and to give them access to 
the sea, access to the Sava. 
  [Leotard] Now, I think it's a demand that is not without 
legitimacy. It's just that the European Union has now drawn up 
a plan to which the three parties involved have more or less 
agreed. We have to work on this now and try to perfect it and to 
improve it. That is what the Americans are asking us to do to 
ensure that it is not an unfair solution. All injustice in that 
part of the world, in that part of the European continent, will 
lead to further violence... 
  [Sinclair, interrupting] You mean too unfair. 
  [Leotard] Too unfair. And so, this is a demand which needs 
to be studied but which is, you see, very difficult. Croatia 
has already said it will never accept the division of its 
Dalmatian territory, its Dalmatian coast. So this is very 
difficult. And in the north, of course, the Serbs also are 
opposed to their corridor there, which is about 8 km wide, being 
cut as well. 
  [Sinclair] Here we must remember that the peace plan 
envisages the division into three republics -- Serb, Croat and... 
  [Leotard, interrupting] And Bosnian Muslim. 
  [Sinclair] Bosnian Muslim -- of all of Bosnia. 
  [Leotard] We must remember that there are enclaves, you see. 
Those three enclaves which are in the east of Bosnia, which are 
Muslim and are within Bosnia. 
  [Sinclair] In a confederation of whatever size. 
  [Leotard] Of course, you have to see the initial peace plan 
as a starting point. That's to say, the basic idea is respect 
of the international frontiers of Bosnia, which have been 
recognized by the international community, and the coexistence 
of its peoples within this territory. This is really something 
that we can hope for, and for which we have to put on pressure. 
Because you can't imagine states that are enemies taking this 
shape. It is inconceivable. You would have dozens of corridors 
and we Europeans know what that means from the last war. So 
these people absolutely have to get on together to cooperate in 
the shape of a confederation, so that they can exchange goods, 
exchange populations, so that there should not be dozens of 
ghettos, making as many seats of violence, of Gaza Strips, as 
has sometimes been said, from where terrorist actions, or acts 
of despair might originate. So it is a very difficult task for 
diplomats, and I think public opinion should encourage this, and 
that of course this peace treaty should not be based on an 
injustice. 
  [Sinclair] What is special about this war in former 
Yugoslavia is that it is not just a civil war, with all its 
horrors -- and the siege of Sarajevo, this terrible civil war -- 
but it is also the first time for 50 years that we have seen an 
attempt at ethnic cleansing, in other words towns and villages 
completely either massacred, or looted and raped, or where in 
any case the inhabitants have been deported to other areas so as 
to make homogenous areas. This is what has been done by the 
Serbs, mainly. 
  [Leotard] This is what it is essential to reject. [passage 
omitted] The truth is that we have a lot of educational work to 
do. Do you have French people, Italians, Spaniards ready to die 
in large numbers, in a war, so that the previous situation can 
be restored? That is the difficulty. We must not hide it. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] Let's broaden the problem a bit to all of East 
Europe. We have seen the sinister Zhirinovskiy today ready to 
send battalions of volunteers to fight in Serbia. Zhirinovskiy 
makes a lot of noise, but is not in power, but won't the 
nationalists he is whipping up force Boris Yeltsin to take this 
overexcited nationalism in Russia into account? 
  [Leotard] This is one of the aspects of this crisis, that 
they are Slavs, and of course the Serbs are Slav and Orthodox, 
and there is a sort of human and intellectual fraternity with 
the Russians, and President Yeltsin has to deal with an 
opposition, as you said, in the opposition -- that is to say 
Zhirinovskiy, who is very nationalistic, chauvinistic, 
xenophobic and fascist -- you can't call it anything else, 
because unfortunately that is the best definition of what he 
stands for. 
  So we must both help Yeltsin to resist this nationalist 
opposition, not allow an anti-Russian, or anti-Slav, attitude to 
take hold, which would be quite out of place, certainly for 
France, and at the same time we have to make sure that this 
poison, this plague, that Europe saw 50 years ago, does not 
spread, as is unfortunately the case in Belgrade now. How else 
can we describe the people currently in Belgrade? And some of 
their associates in Bosnia. So the democracies have to be on 
guard to ensure that the values in their inheritance -- respect 
for human rights, elections, the right to come and go, the 
dignity of the human person -- should all be defended here. If 
it is not defended here, how can it be defended elsewhere? 
  [Sinclair] So if it is defended here, won't this create a 
European precedent? What will we do the day that this or that 
minority in Russia or elsewhere in East Europe is either 
oppressed or oppressor? 
  [Leotard] Mr. Balladur, the French prime minister, has put 
forward an initiative, which I think quite exemplary, as to what 
the French position, and, I was going to say, French 
intelligence, could be in that part of Europe. It is called a 
stability plan, a stability pact, which is to examine the 
problem of frontiers and the problem of minorities before crises 
arise, as a preventative measure. [passage omitted] I think we 
are faced with a resurgence of nationalism and ethnic or, 
unfortunately, religious demands, which are fatal for Europe. 
We fought this for decades, and they are coming back, and you 
will see that the borders here are the former borders that are 
very, very old. [passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] Mr. Leotard, there are exactly 10 days left, or a 
bit more, since it is next Sunday at midnight that the 
cease-fire [as heard] will expire. Do you hope things will 
move, that the Serbs will hand their heavy artillery over to 
UNPROFOR? Are you hoping for a positive outcome? 
  [Leotard] I am hoping with all my heart that things happen 
in 
the way we intend. [passage omitted] I just want to say that 
there are people around today who are warmongers, who say: The 
only thing to do is to make war. But that isn't true. There 
are people on the other hand who say: We mustn't look, it's too 
awful, it isn't our business. That isn't true either. In fact 
we are faced with a reality that is going to affect us, which 
can affect us, and France's honor lies in being there with her 
soldiers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Claus Gennrich report: "Germany Is Not Merely a Spectator"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 10 February -- Chancellor Kohl discussed the 
decision of the NATO Council with U.S. President Clinton on 
Wednesday night [9 February]. Kohl assured Clinton of German 
support for the position of the alliance, aimed at threatening 
the Serbs with air strikes and at continuing talks among the 
warring parties in Geneva. Kohl talked with Clinton about the 
statement that the president issued shortly afterward, in which 
he mentioned the two goals. As became known in Bonn, possible 
forms of indirect German participation in military operations 
were not discussed. 
  Foreign Minister Kinkel announced on Thursday that nobody 
has 
approached Germany so far. He added: "We will do what we can 
from a legal viewpoint, and if we receive any requests, we will 
comply if we can." Kinkel mentioned considerations concerning 
logistic aid. "We cannot support the alliance partners morally 
and refuse to comply with requests that we can actually fulfill 
from a legal viewpoint." Germany will try to ensure that. 
Military participation is not possible because of the German 
constitution. 
  Kinkel pointed out Germany's political efforts to come 
closer 
to a negotiated result on the basis of the Juppe-Kinkel plan. 
This concept is still being pursued. "Germany is not merely a 
passive spectator." In view of Germany's size and 
responsibility, Germans are participating in observer missions 
of the European Union. German pilots are taking part in the 
airlift for Sarajevo and the supply of other Bosnian towns by 
air. Also, the Bundeswehr is involved in AWACS surveillance 
flights. However, these flights will not be affected by 
"possible air strikes." 
  Kinkel also mentioned the participation of the Federal Navy 
in monitoring the Adriatic Sea and the involvement of German 
customs officials in ensuring the observance of the embargo 
against Serbia-Montenegro on the Danube. Germany has so far 
paid 612 million German marks for humanitarian purposes, which 
is more than any other European country has provided. Nearly 
400,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina have been accepted by 
Germany -- twice as many as all the other Europeans states put 
together. 
  On Wednesday, Kinkel spoke several times on the telephone to 
U.S. Secretary of State Christopher. Tarnoff, Christopher's 
under secretary, and Redman, the U.S. observer at the Geneva 
negotiations, visited London, Paris, and Bonn. A change in the 
cool U.S. attitude so far adopted toward the Geneva negotiations 
became apparent. According to Kinkel, the talks focused on how 
the "political process" might be revived through cooperation 
between the European Union and the United States on the NATO 
decisions. 
  Bonn officials noted that Washington wants to assume a "more 
active role" and "participate in the political procedures." The 
"European plan of action" might serve as a basis. The "overall 
concept of the Europeans" includes the demilitarization of 
Sarajevo and its protection by the United Nations. German 
diplomacy will try to implement this concept together with 
Washington. 
  Kinkel stated that Russia should be involved "as much as 
possible." The foreign minister called on the Serbs, Croats, 
and Muslims to contribute to "achieving a peaceful settlement" 
at the Geneva negotiations which resumed on Thursday. This is 
not possible without the parties to the conflict, he added. 
Kinkel expressed the hope that this time the cease-fire for 
Sarajevo agreed on Wednesday morning will hold. "It is in the 
interest of all of us that the decisions of the NATO Council and 
of the foreign ministers of the European Union do not have to be 
implemented." If the parties to the conflict take the warning 
seriously, what the NATO Council demanded might be achieved 
without air strikes. "If not, all those involved must know that 
NATO is serious this time." 
  Kinkel stressed that UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali 
approved the decisions that evening in a telephone conversation 
with NATO Secretary General Woerner. The European members of 
the Security Council, England and France, did not consider any 
new decisions by the Security Council necessary. They believe 
that Resolutions 824 and 836 and the decision by the NATO 
Council are sufficient as a basis for action. A spokesman for 
the secretary general, who stated that a new Security Council 
resolution is required, has meanwhile announced that he did not 
have enough information. 
  Kinkel described possible future developments as follows: 
"If it is considered necessary after the 10-day period on 20 
February, the UN secretary general will make a decision and 
issue the combat order. If Sarajevo should continue to be 
shelled, measures will be taken on the spot by the UN commander 
in chief in cooperation with NATO." If Serbian guns "should 
reappear" after an air strike, "a second operation might be 
needed." Yet the foreign minister expressed the hope that the 
U.S. attitude and the NATO decision might form the basis of a 
political settlement. 
  Besides Sarajevo, other towns are also hard pressed. 
However, the capital has a symbolic function. If the situation 
should deteriorate in other towns after an improvement in 
Sarajevo, "new considerations and new decisions" will be 
required. Kinkel hinted that he will hold talks and try to find 
out whether a meeting of the foreign ministers of the "troika" 
of the European Union -- Belgium, Germany, and Greece -- should 
be arranged next week. There were reports about plans that the 
three foreign ministers wanted to hold talks with Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev in Athens next week. It has now become 
known that Kozyrev's participation is "rather unlikely."

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Paquet: "Military Weighs Effective </F>
Action Against Escalation"] 
  [Text] While not all politicians are agreed on the 
appropriateness of resorting to air strikes in Bosnia, unanimous 
agreement is also absent among the military. They, too, are 
divided on both the effectiveness of air strikes and the 
seriousness of any reprisals they may provoke. 
  The Gulf War has no doubt demonstrated the possibility of 
so-called surgical strikes, effected with sufficient precision 
to reduce to a minimum the risk of "collateral damage" caused to 
persons and property outside the target. But, as an officer 
back from Yugoslavia is quick to point out, "the situation in 
Sarajevo is very different: Here we are not in a situation of a 
conflict between regular armies, and civilians are present 
everywhere, as are the blue helmets and international 
volunteers. The probability of error is thus considerable." 
<H5>  Human Error </H5>
  Furthermore, continues a specialist in artillery matters, 
"two factors determine strike precision: The precision with 
which the target is identified and the precision of the firing 
system used to attack it. In both these cases, today's 
technology allows exceptional performances, virtually down to 
the very last centimeter. But despite this, you cannot exclude 
a technical fault, and even less human error. Remember how U.S. 
helicopters mistakenly fired on British tanks in the Gulf War." 
  Allowing for these reservations, experts agree that strikes 
limited to the hills around Sarajevo, where the Serbs have 
concentrated their artillery, "would produce good results," 
whether against dug-in pieces or mobile arms. "It is just as 
mistaken to claim that the former are indestructible as to 
assert that the latter are much less vulnerable," states General 
Robert Close, citing the precedents of the war in Algeria and 
the Second World War. 
  This judgment is shared by experts from the former Yugoslav 
Army. "The Serbs are using old equipment," one of them 
observes. "They are often towed pieces which take time to be 
moved. The major Western armies have radar which make it 
possible to locate artillery batteries immediately after the 
first shell is fired. So it only takes a few minutes, if not 
seconds, to destroy them. If the equipment and competent men 
are at hand." 
<H5>  Reprisals </H5>
  That is no doubt the main problem. It seems that the use of 
air strikes requires a strengthening of UN forces in Bosnia and 
more comprehensive weaponry, both to ensure the success of the 
military operations envisaged and to protect the blue helmets 
from any reprisals which -- without necessary going as far as a 
pitched battle -- could use the most murderous terrorist 
practices. 
  But to go down this road is to prepare for an escalation 
which the West clearly does not want. An officer pointed out 
that -- while the subject of air strikes has been fiercely 
debated -- NATO has never dared shoot down a single one of the 
helicopters which are constantly violating the air exclusion 
zone over Bosnia.

<F P=106> [By Sabine Gillot] </F>
  [Text] The Hague, Feb 11 (AFP) -- Defendants who refuse to 
appear here before the international tribunal on war crimes in 
former Yugoslavia will have charges, evidence and arrest 
warrants against them made public, a court judge said Friday [11 
February]. 
  Speaking after the end of a session at which the tribunal's 
judges adopted the court's procedural code, Claude Jorda told 
AFP he and his 11 colleagues had reached a compromise over 
trying alleged war criminals in their absence, admissable under 
French but not under English law. 
  "We have taken the French concept to its limits, which has 
allowed us to establish a procedure which, while not judging the 
accused in absentia, will allow us to make public the charge 
against him," Jorda said. 
  The code, a mixture of procedural systems from across the 
world, is scheduled for publication in mid-March. 
  The judge added that international arrest warrants issued by 
the tribunal would also be published, so that any accused 
refusing to attend would be unable to plead his innocence before 
any other body. 
  Under the tribunal's new code, evidence on charges against 
an 
absent defendant will be presented at public hearings, whose 
proceedings will be passed verbatim to the United Nations 
Security Council and the country believed to be sheltering the 
accused. 
  Jorda said some alleged war criminals were being sheltered 
in 
"completely civilised countries," but refused to specify which. 
  Commenting on press reports criticising the court since its 
inauguration last November under UN auspices for inaction and 
lack of real authority, Jorda said the tribunal "wanted to do 
better than Nuremberg," the site of the war crimes trials of 
leading Nazis. 
  That court "was accused of implementing hasty procedures and 
was above all a court of victors." 
  He added: "We needed a procedural code, without with there 
would be neither prosecutor nor tribunal. That is the least 
that we owe victims and accused." 
  "In respect of the mandate given us by the UN Security 
Council, we have got as far as we could after starting off with 
nothing...less than three months ago." 
  The tribunal's new clerk, Theo van Boven, said he was 
confident that trials could get under way before the end of the 
year. 
  Its next session takes place from April 25 to May 13. In the 
interim its draft budget is expected to be approved by the UN, 
said a statement from the tribunal.

  [Text] Vienna, Feb 11 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) is "skeptical" that North Korea will allow 
inspections of its nuclear sites and wants the UN Security 
Council to decide whether to impose sanctions, Western diplomats 
said here Friday [11 February]. 
  They said the IAEA's Swedish general-director Hans Blix had 
stressed repeatedly that it was "not necessary" for the 
organization's board of governors to adopt a resolution sending 
the issue to the Security Council when the governors next meet 
on February 21. 
  However, the board's 35 members are to hold consultations 
next week on what position to take over North Korea's persistant 
refusal to have its nuclear facilities inspected, diplomats said. 
  And certain delegations appeared to favour taking a "firm" 
stance. 
  The IAEA is not empowered itself to slap sanctions on the 
country. 
  "No one really knows if North Korea has an atomic bomb, but 
because of its refusal (to allow inspections), suspicion, 
concern and doubt are growing and the North Koreans are doing 
nothing to allay these doubts," the diplomats added. 
  There has been no official contact between the agency and 
North Korea since January 25, when the IAEA provided further 
details on what kind of inspection measures it deemed necessary. 
North Korea subsequently rejected some of these measures. 
  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu was due to meet 
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington on 
Friday to discuss North Korea's persistant refusal to have its 
nuclear facilities inspected. 
  Han's visit comes as the IAEA awaits a response from 
Pyongyang in the next two weeks on outside inspection of its 
suspect nuclear sites. 
  If no progress is made, the Vienna-based IAEA will meet 
February 21 to announce it can no longer certify that North 
Korea has no nuclear-weapons program, possibly leading to a US 
request for UN Security Council sanctions. 
  Such a move, however, could be stopped by China, one of the 
council's five permanent, veto-wielding members. The WASHINGTON 
POST said Thursday that China recently rejected a proposal to 
have the council issue Pyongyang a warning.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Work for Russian Nuclear </F>
Experts"] 
  [Text] Three thousand Russian nuclear experts, previously 
working on nuclear weapons, could soon be employed at an 
institute for scientific and technological research in Moscow 
paid for by the West and Japan. They would thus be switching to 
projects for the peaceful use of nuclear power and better 
protection for Russia's nuclear power stations. 
  Yesterday evening the European Parliament [EP] in Strasbourg 
unanimously voted for a provisional protocol, thus giving the 
go-ahead to found such an institute. This was required because 
the Russian Parliament, the Douma, was not able to ratify the 
agreement with the European Union, the United States, and Japan 
as a result of the stormy political events in Moscow. 
  During a debate in Strasbourg yesterday, Dutch MP Jessica 
Larive (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]), EP 
rapporteur on founding the new center in Moscow, referred to an 
urgent need to stop the brain drain from Russia of nuclear 
scientists who were all employed under the Soviet system on the 
production and maintenance of nuclear weapons. So far 500 have 
left, possibly to suspect countries such as Iraq, Libya and 
Iran, plus the nuclear power China. 
  Between 1971 and 1993, some 700,000 people lived in the 10 
secret nuclear towns. Larive believes most of them are still 
there. But they no longer enjoy their former privileges such as 
high wages, free housing and education, and there are problems 
with food supplies. There is no other employment for the nuclear 
technicians, as they are bound to secrecy by the Russian 
Government. The hard core of 500 scientists with knowledge of 
the Soviet system for chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons 
can now be employed on peaceful projects in Moscow. The 
European Union, the United States, and Japan have so far set 
aside some 126 million guilders for the center. Russia has even 
made a Moscow building available.

  [Excerpts] Slovakia became the seventh country officially 
to join the Partnership for Peace plan today. This initiative 
will enable us to take part in joint military exercises and in 
NATO peace missions. As Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar stressed 
before departing by air for Brussels, it is important for 
Slovakia, within the framework of Partnership for Peace, to try 
to make the potential of its arms industry available to 
all-European cooperation. 
  Departing for the Belgian capital with Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar, Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes, and Defense 
Minister Imrich Andrejcak, was our editor Agata Stanekova. Here 
is her first report: 
  [Stanekova] The plane with the Slovak delegation on board 
landed at Brussels airport at 0900 today. Shortly after 
arriving at NATO headquarters, Vladimir Meciar and Defense 
Minister Imrich Andrejcak met Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO 
first deputy secretary general. The official proceedings for 
signing the Partership for Peace document followed. The festive 
act of signing took place at exactly 1030. [passage omitted] 
  Shortly before the treaty signing, NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner said that Slovakia is one of the youngest 
democratic countries in Europe. He said: As a state, you are 
therefore facing many political and economic changes. Your early 
decision to participate in Partnership for Peace is a clear 
indication that you are not limited by your independence. In 
the world of today, gains from independence can only come in 
cooperation with others. By signing this document, therefore, 
you declare that you have opted for cooperation in the name of 
peace and stability. 
  As Vladimir Meciar said at a brief news conference, by its 
membership of Partnership for Peace, the Slovak Republic is not 
only giving but also taking. It is an opportunity to acquire 
rapidly the principles and methods of building NATO armies. On 
our part, we are interested in joint planning and in preparing a 
unit that could serve common actions, if necessary. We are 
offering our training areas, we would welcome a training center 
for officers to suit the needs of these units in Central Europe. 
We are offering our arms industry potential to build the future 
unified Army of NATO countries. 
  As Vladimir Meciar said, Slovakia understands this plan as 
the beginning of its journey toward full membership in the 
alliance. Partnership for Peace guarantees security and 
opportunity for all and creates scope for preventing two 
Europes, Vladimir Meciar said.

  [Text] Finland's participation in NATO's Partnership for 
Peace program is likely to be restricted to peacekeeping 
training in the initial stage. According to Foreign Minister 
Heikki Haavisto, Finland will study the matter during the spring 
and will have talks both with NATO countries and neutral 
countries about the Partnership for Peace offer. Haavisto 
reported on the offer to the Diet's Foreign Affairs Committee 
today. 
  Pertti Paasio, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, 
also thought that peacekeeping training was the only form of 
Finnish participation in the initial stage. According to 
Paasio, Sweden and Switzerland are very interested in the 
Partnership for Peace. Paasio thought it possible that at best 
the Partnership could be the beginning of a pan-European 
security system.

<F P=106> [Marc Paoloni report: "Brussels Has Doubts About American </F>
Success"] 
  [Text] "Nothing substantial should come out of the 
American-Japanese negotiations -- except, of course, just enough 
for Bill Clinton to save face." Despite this calm assurance, 
European experts in Brussels do not hide the fact that they will 
be following these talks with the greatest attention. 
  "So far, Tokyo has categorically refused to commit itself to 
actual import figures, but you never know what might happen. We 
could be forced to totally revise our approach," commented a 
close collaborator of European Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan. 
  Sir Leon's staff explain that the Community, like the United 
States, intends to create a bigger opening in the Japanese 
market, but that it is totally opposed to the method chosen by 
Washington. "There is no question of negotiating import figures. 
On this point, we side fully with Japan." 
  This is a position of principle that barely conceals the 
bitterness of certain officials in the face of the EC's 
powerlessness to impose the same concessions on Tokyo as the 
United States has done. This irritation is exacerbated by the 
fact that the concessions demanded by Washington are, generally 
speaking, "seriously discriminatory to European exports." 
  "Take the example of semiconductors," stressed the expert. 
"The Japanese made assurances that the 20 percent of their 
market offered to imports was open to all countries, while 
everyone knew that a secret clause reserved this 20 percent for 
the United States." 
  "Do not be impressed by the American song and dance," 
insists 
another expert nevertheless. "We continued to reduce our trade 
deficit with Japan last year." 
  In other words, unless the "Clinton method" leads to a 
genuine success this weekend, Brussels should continue its 
strategy: Examine all the obstacles -- with Tokyo and on a 
sector by sector basis -- facing EC exporters and the ways of 
surmounting them. "Seven working meetings have already been 
held since January 1993, and we hope," stressed this expert, "to 
be able to report concrete results at the next interministerial 
meeting in late April."

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Cambon: "European Union Summit--Algeria on </F>
the Agenda"] 
  [Text] Algeria is on the agenda of today's European Union 
[EU] Council. But while EU members, on the initiative of 
France, are ready to help sort out the country's problems in 
order to prevent Islamists from achieving their aims, they 
expect authorities in Algiers to implement both financial and 
political reforms. 
  The events in Algeria will be discussed today in Brussels at 
the meeting of the 12 European foreign ministers. A few days 
before an Algerian delegation is due to fly to Washington to 
negotiate the rescheduling of the country's external debt (some 
$26 billion) with the IMF, the Europeans are expected to 
reaffirm their opposition to terrorism, to condemn human rights 
abuse, and to insist on the need for democratic dialogue and the 
urgent implementation of economic reforms that include solving 
the debt problem with the IMF. If such conditions are met, the 
EU is expected to confirm its commitment to assisting the 
Algerians in their national rescue operation. 
  There is still some way to go before reaching that stage, 
however. And European diplomatic circles -- including French 
ones -- can barely conceal a measure of embarrassment. "We are 
not breathing down the neck of Algiers authorities. However, 
the way the government is working there must be reformed," says 
a diplomat. In the meantime, the French Government seems ready 
to renew in 1994 a financial protocol at least equal to that of 
1993, which was worth Fr6.35 billion, 90 percent of which was 
effectively used by Algerians. There also is hope that if an 
agreement with the IMF is reached, Algeria may benefit from $4 
to $5 billion in immediate aid. 
  EU circles in Brussels also indicate that, since 1978, 
Europeans have continually offered Algeria a project-related 
financial assistance whose ceiling was gradually increased 
through the years, but which was used...less and less by the 
Algerian authorities. To such an extent that only 12 percent of 
the ECU239 million granted for the 1987-1991 period was actually 
drawn on. As for the ECU350 million allocated for 1992-1996, it 
has not yet been touched. 
<H5>  Emergency </H5>
  This is the proof of the Algerian Government's impotence and 
the gradual decay of the country's economy, whose imports have 
been halved since 1986. Today, the noose is getting dangerously 
tight around Algeria's neck due to the country's political 
inability to acknowledge the need to reschedule its external 
debt. 
  Today, taking action has become more urgent than ever. Oil 
prices have dropped by about 25 percent since last summer. For 
1994, debt service will total $9 billion while export revenues 
(derived mostly from oil and gas) are not expected to exceed 
this same figure. 
  "Failure to reach an agreement with the IMF would mean a 
total collapse of the economy," stated Algerian Economy Minister 
Mourad Benachenhou recently. The IMF requirements for a 
structural adjustment program have long been known: devaluation 
of the dinar by at leat 30 percent, or even 50 percent; drastic 
reduction of the budget deficit; and a wider opening of the 
Algerian market to foreign competition. The latter requirement 
may increase the difficulties of the uncompetitive local 
industry, whose industrial output is less than 50 percent of 
production capacity, and inflate the jobless rate in a country 
which already has more than 2 million unemployed. 
  A particularly bitter, albeit an inevitable, pill that 
already has the UGTA (General Union of Algerian Workers) 
howling; Abdelbak Benhamuda, its general secretary, has 
condemned "the groveling before the IMF" and threatened a 
"general uprising" that would stem from the soaring price of 
basic food products, of which there is already a near shortage. 
  Shortly after taking office, Algeria's President General 
Zeroual is already caught between undeterred Islamic terrorists 
and the danger of a social explosion comparable to the tragic 
one Algeria experienced in 1988.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Audiovisual: European Union-U.S. </F>
Dialogue Reopened Soon"] 
  [Text] After adopting a tougher tone at the beginning of 
January, the United States now seems to be ready for dialogue 
with the European Union (EU) on the audiovisual issue. 
  "This is very important for our country," Joan Spero, U.S. 
undersecretary of state for the economy, said on Thursday [3 
February] after discussions with her French and European 
Commission colleagues. "At the same time, we would like to find 
a means of establishing a somewhat calmer dialogue." 
  Top U.S. and European officials met this week in the 
framework of the "transatlantic declaration" which, since the 
end of the 1980's, has enabled Washington and Brussels to 
discuss their differences every six months instead of launching 
trade wars. The audiovisual sphere is still a considerable bone 
of contention, and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
stepped up the pressure in January, announcing an offensive 
against European aid systems, which he regards as discriminatory. 
  The end of the GATT negotiations in December did not make it 
possible to clear up the matter. The audiovisual sector is 
mentioned in the agreement, although the EU has not given any 
pledge to reduce its subsidies to the producers of programs or 
to dismantle legislation such as the quotas for the distribution 
of European works. For the Europeans, and especially France, 
this amounts to the "cultural exception" which had been demanded. 
  "As far as we are concerned, the matter is settled," a 
Commission spokesman said. But Washington does not see things 
that way and has not given up trying to force the opening up of 
European borders to products of its audiovisual industry, which 
generate export revenue of over $3.5 billion per year.

<F P=106> [Emmanuelle Peyret report: "Pan-European Conference on Drug </F>
Addiction"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- "East Europe must, first of all, learn 
its lessons from the failures of the West in the fight against 
drug trafficking and consumption: Repression has shown its 
limitations. From now on, we must gear all our efforts toward 
prevention and education." This was how Raymond Kendall, the 
secretary general of Interpol, summed up the conclusions of the 
second pan-European conference on drug addiction, which brought 
together some 40 European health ministers at the Council of 
Europe. 
  Prevention and education: Those were the main points of the 
conference, along with an undercurrent of aid to the countries 
of East Europe, which are for the moment totally devoid of any 
legislation, institutions, or specialist personnel. Cooperation 
with the East European governments, which are asking for a great 
deal of aid to combat drugs, "is slowly taking shape," explained 
Christopher Luckett, head of the drug division at the Pompidou 
group. "These countries have set up government committees on 
drug trafficking with which we are working," continued Luckett. 
  Unlike our Western democracies, East Europe is not yet used 
to a high level of consumption of hard drugs. "In these 
countries, alcohol, solvents, and the abuse of medicines 
prevail," continued Luckett. The priority in the fight against 
drugs is therefore, as the Interpol head stressed, "to prevent 
the importation of a consumption market into East Europe. This 
is where prevention is essential," something which could be 
implemented through pan-European action. 
  East Europe -- a drug transit region through the historic 
Balkan route, which bypasses wars like the one in Yugoslavia, or 
which finds different ways --has become a major production area. 
This is what really worries most of the participants at the 
Strasbourg conference. "Indeed, our biggest worry today, or at 
least the worry of the institutions which are fighting drug 
trafficking and production, is the tens of thousands of hectares 
planted with poppy and cannabis and growing in the Asiatic 
republics of the former USSR: Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and 
Tajikistan have now become uncontrollable areas for us, where 
local and ethnic conflicts are mixed up with arms and drug 
trafficking, with the one financing the other." Luckett 
concludes that Europe has no weapons to fight this.

<F P=106> [Article by Henk Aben: "European Parliament Remains Hampered </F>
by Impotence"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- "Europe is dying in Sarajevo," said 
Netherlander Mr. Arie Oostlander (of the CDA [Christian 
Democratic Appeal] -- ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD editor's note) yesterday 
in the Chamber of the European Parliament. 
  The Chamber's reaction to the statement made by Theodoros 
Pangalos, Greek president of the European Council of Ministers, 
who could say nothing other than that no decision had been made, 
bore witness to Parliament's bewilderment and impotence. Mr. 
Pangalos did, however, at least express some optimism regarding 
the peace talks, which resumed in Geneva today. 
  Pangalos said his government was not in favor of military 
intervention in the Balkans. However, Greece will not oppose 
any decision, should one finally be forthcoming. He also stated 
that all the warring factions had committed war crimes, "albeit 
not to the same extent." 
  It was mainly MEP's [members of the European Parliament] 
from 
the Netherlands who expressed their outrage on behalf of the 
groups they represented: "Europe lost face long ago," said Mr. 
Eisso Woltjer of the PvdA [Labor Party]. "Something like 200,000 
people have died. How long must we look on, resigned to the 
situation?" he wondered. 
  "A cease-fire must come about within two weeks. That must be 
the ultimatum. Otherwise, the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia 
must be lifted so that the legal government can defend itself," 
said the Liberals, via their spokesman, Jan Willem Bertens of 
the D66 [Democrats 1966]. "Even the credibility of our 
conscience is at stake," he added. 
  The Greens were of the opinion that the European Parliament 
should really have a permanent presence in Sarajevo, with 
European Parliament President Egon Klepsch having an obligation 
to visit the Bosnian capital, and a small group of MEP's staying 
on in the city afterwards -- even if merely as a gesture of 
solidarity. The idea was certainly well received by other 
political groups.

<F P=106> [Article by Western European Union Defense Commission </F>
President Jacques Baumel: "Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Ten days to take war away from Sarajevo. At last, 
the reaction for which we had been awaiting for months! It took 
the unbearable images of the dead and wounded lying on the white 
snow of Sarajevo to crack the monument of hypocrisy and 
cowardice which concealed the murder of a nation in the midst of 
heedless Europe. Of course, there had to be a few UN Tartuffes 
[hypocrites] questioning who was ultimately responsible for the 
massacres! As if we had not known for two years exactly who has 
been shelling Sarajevo and murdering women and children! Future 
historians will wonder how -- after the end of the Cold War -- 
so many powerful nations and their diplomats could let 200,000 
people be slaughtered and 2 million refugees be deported by 
thinly disguised killers whom they respectfully welcomed in 
Geneva for farcical and shameful conferences. 
  All it took was -- thanks to France's persistence -- a long 
overdue warning issued by NATO, and what was deemed impossible 
materialized: a cease-fire agreement complete with the Serbs 
vowing to withdraw their cannons. Is this a last-ditch maneuver 
or a newfound wisdom born of fear? 
  Without allowing ourselves to be fooled once more, we now 
must maintain the pressure and the threat of action in case of 
deception. Seldom has a 10-day ultimatum been so important. Of 
course, one must not be content with a vague cease-fire 
agreement in Sarajevo, which can always be canceled. The West 
must demand that fighting stop everywhere in Bosnia, so that 
real negotiations can resume and Serb armed gangs are made to 
leave regions they should not be in. 
  There can be no question of the aggressors obtaining in 
peace 
what they could not grab through war and bloodshed. But can 
peoples who have suffered so much violence be made to agree to 
peaceful coexistence? 
  If -- should the ultimatum be rejected -- air strikes become 
necessary, the allies must know how far they are ready to go. 
They must agree on this from the outset, as we must no longer 
say things we do not intend to put into practice. 
  Right now, two lessons can be drawn from this atrocious and 
interminable carnage. First, the United Nations does not have 
the wherewithal to plan and manage peacekeeping missions, as 
shown by its actions in Somalia and Bosnia. The United Nations 
-- which lacks means and experience as well as a competent 
military staff, money, and a real chain of command -- cannot 
even enforce its own resolutions! 
  Which country will want to contribute its soldiers if the 
outcome is certain to be a failure? Humanitarian action must no 
longer hinder the restoration of peace. 
  Faced with the lessened interest for Europe demonstrated by 
the Americans as well as Russia's new hardline stance, and in 
the perspective of future "Yugoslavias," Europe must urgently 
create a purely European defense structure. By embracing for the 
first time the concept of a European defense identity, NATO's 
latest summit in Brussels provided Europe with a historic 
opportunity. Can Europe seize it? If it does not, the worst 
will surely come! 
  In front of expiring Bosnia -- just like yesterday before 
Munich -- Europe must choose between dishonor and courage. Its 
whole fate hinges on this alternative. Otherwise, what would be 
the point of holding, in three months' time, a European election 
which over half of the French population will boycott? 
  More than the Serbs' vague commitment, NATO's resolve is a 
historic turning point for security in Europe.

Mediation"] 
  [Text] Geneva -- In the future Austria will be more 
involved than before in the international mediation in the 
Bosnian conflict. On Wednesday [9 February], at a conference of 
the seven neighboring states of ex-Yugoslavia, the participating 
foreign ministers decided to develop a security paper together 
with the Western European Union (WEU) and the CSCE. Foreign 
Minister Mock stated that this document is to point out the 
danger of an escalation of the conflict. 
  Moreover, the foreign ministers of Austria, Hungary, 
Romania, 
Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, and Italy are planning a follow-up 
meeting to discuss the effects of the sanctions against the rest 
of Yugoslavia. 
  The international UN expert commission for war crimes has 
documented 55,000 cases since 1992 and will present them later 
to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, according to 
Cherif Bassiouni, its head. Most of the victims are Bosnian 
Muslims.

<F P=106> [Article signed CB: "European Parliament Is Unhappy About </F>
Enlargement Negotiations"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- The European Parliament is unhappy 
about the way the enlargement negotiations are being held with 
Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. The Parliament feels that 
little or no account is being taken of its wish for 
institutional changes to allow a Union with 16 member states to 
function smoothly. Various speakers warned the Council of 
Ministers, which is leading the negotiations, that it was 
playing with fire by neglecting Parliament's complaints. They 
were referring to the Parliament's power to prevent enlargement. 
  Fernand Herman (PSC) [Social Christian Party] best summed up 
the feelings of many MEP's [members of the European Parliament] 
when he said that it was not a question of being for or against 
the four countries. "On the contrary, in the entire Parliament 
there is probably nobody against the membership of new member 
states," he said. "The question is just whether the new members 
are joining under conditions which would allow the Union to act 
as effectively as it does at present." 
  Many MEP's are convinced that a purely mechanical 
modification of the institutional rules, with every new member 
state getting a commissioner, some seats in Parliament and 
(weighted) voting rights in the Council, would be inadequate and 
only increase the chances of deadlock. But so far the Council 
has taken no account of Parliament's concerns, which have been 
aired on past occasions, and yesterday that put many MEP's in a 
touchy mood. 
  In his reaction the Greek Council President Theodoros 
Pangalos pointed out that the negotiations had taken place on 
the basis of the Maastricht Treaty right from the beginning. "A 
treaty change does not take place during negotiations on 
enlargement, but at a special conference of the governments of 
the member states called together for that purpose," Pangalos 
said. In reality the Parliament realizes that. But, in 
exchange for its agreement to enlargement, it wants to win 
guarantees on the working methods of the 1996 conference on 
treaty changes, and participation in it. Following the 
Maastricht Treaty, the Parliament still has no decisive voice in 
treaty changes. 
  Not much was revealed about the progress of the enlargement 
negotiations yesterday. Commissioner Hans van den Broek let it 
be known that he doubted whether the negotiations with the four 
countries could be completed by 1 March. The agricultural issue 
was becoming hard work, van den Broek said, and at the end of 
the negotiations budget contributions must be discussed. He 
said he could not guarantee all four countries would make a net 
contribution to the European budget, which the present member 
states had originally hoped for.

<F P=106> [Rolf Gustavsson report: "The Parliament Relaxed Its </F>
Demands"] 
  [Excerpt] Strasbourg -- The European Parliament will not 
make any strict formal demand which would delay the admission of 
new members in to the EU [European Union]. After less than two 
hours of debate yesterday the parliament agreed on a statement 
which makes it possible -- theoretically and formally, at least 
-- to keep to the very tight timetable for the negotiations with 
Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria. Nevertheless the 
Parliament's position means in practice that the negotiations 
must be fully completed by 8-9 March so that the results are 
available on 10 March. 
  The Parliament will then be able to begin discussion of the 
matter based on the summary which sets out the results of the 
negotiations, but Parliament demands that the final, legally 
binding texts of the agreements be submitted to it before it 
votes in May -- probably on 4 May. 
  At that point the Parliament will have to bring together 260 
deputies who will vote "yes." 
  Usually only around 300 out of 518 parliamentary deputies 
are 
in place here during the parliamentary sessions, and when it 
comes to admitting new members the requirement is that a 
majority of the parliament's 518 deputies back such a decision.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with French European Affairs Minister </F>
Alain Lamassoure by Ingrid Hedstrom in Brussels during EU 
foreign ministers meeting on 7 and 8 February] 
  [Text] Brussels -- "As a member of the EU [European Union], 
in the longer term Sweden must join the Western European defense 
alliance, the WEU [Western European Union]. Sweden should also 
be ready to allow its defense forces to serve the EU's common 
foreign and security policy." 
  So said French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure, 
who visits Sweden on Friday [11 February] for talks with the 
Swedish Government. 
  DAGENS NYHETER met him in Brussels during a break in the 
meeting of EU foreign ministers. In the interview Alain 
Lamassoure returned time and time again with an almost religious 
passion to the EU's need for a common foreign and security 
policy. But he also left the door ajar on the possibility of 
special regional support for northern Sweden, spoke about the 
problems the fall in the value of the krona has caused French 
industry, and denied that France is the villain of the 
membership negotiations and a constant opponent of Sweden. 
  Anyone who has followed the negotiations might otherwise 
have 
easily formed the impression that France is the country which is 
at the head of the resistance to Sweden's negotiating demands. 
It was France which long blocked the question of snuff; France 
took a tough line against Sweden's demands relating to car 
exhaust emissions; France is doubtful especially about 
agricultural support for farmers in northern Sweden. 
  But Alain Lamassoure gave assurances that France "is happy" 
about Sweden's membership application and is adopting "a 
well-disposed attitude" to Swedish demands. However, in the 
past France did have its fears about Sweden as an EU member, he 
said: "From the beginning we had major worries about the EU's 
common foreign and security policy." 
  However, France's concern that neutral Sweden would slow 
down 
the EU's march toward the common foreign and security policy 
which France considers to be extraordinarily important has been 
allayed. Alain Lamassoure said: "Yes, after we listened to the 
Swedish leaders, especially your prime minister who visited 
Paris a few months ago, and after Sweden adopted the declaration 
in which all the applicant nations commit themselves to 
adjusting their legislation so that it falls in line with the 
needs of the common foreign and security policy." 
  When Sweden's membership negotiations started, European 
Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel stressed in his speech that the 
Riksdag has stated that Sweden's military nonalignment continues 
to exist. 
  Alain Lamassoure did not give a direct answer when asked 
whether nonalignment is possible for Sweden as an EU member: 
"Neutrality and nonalignment no longer have any meaning. The 
world is no longer divided into two blocs," he said. "Today all 
EU member nations must be involved in shaping a common foreign 
and security policy and should be ready to put their military 
capacity at the service of this policy." 
  [Hedstrom] Must Sweden join the WEU? 
  "Yes, in the longer term," Alain Lamassoure replied. "At 
present it is not compulsory. According to the Maastricht 
Treaty, member nations can either be members of the WEU or 
observers. Observer status can be permitted, but it is only 
provisional. We hope that Sweden can become a full member of 
the WEU, which is in a way the European Union's military defense 
arm." 
  The meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels is negotiating 
regional policy with Sweden for the first time. The EU foreign 
minister has given the thumbs-down to so-called Objective 1 
support -- the EU's special support for poor regions -- to 
Norrbotten while Sweden is standing firm on its demand for 
special regional support for Norrland. 
  "We consider that Sweden has a geographical handicap because 
of the latitudes in which the country lies. Sweden has a right 
to have a regional policy which compensates for this handicap. 
What has not been resolved is how this is to be combined with 
the EU's regional policy," Lamassoure said. 
  "Our approach is that we want to find a solution which 
corresponds to Sweden's needs without again opening up the 
discussion within the EU. We have devoted months to discussing 
which regions would receive Objective 1 support. If we let 
Norrbotten receive Objective 1 support there would be a great 
risk that we would receive new demands from regions within the 
EU. 
  "If it is possible to find a different solution, we would 
prefer that. But I am not worried, because I consider that when 
it comes to these problems it ought to be possible to find a 
solution." 
  [Hedstrom] Is a special solution, which does not directly 
correspond to the EU's current rules -- an "Arctic" fund, for 
example -- possible? 
  "We are in the process of looking at this together," Alain 
Lamassoure replied. 
  When the Volvo-Renault deal collapsed, the French president 
hinted that this could have an effect on the EU negotiations 
with Sweden. But Lamassoure denied that the breakdown of the 
marriage between the two car companies had caused bad blood. 
Something that has bothered France more is the increase in 
French imports of Swedish wood and paper products since the 
collapse of the Swedish krona made it possible to reduce prices. 
  But unlike the Finnish authorities, the Swedish authorities 
have been "cooperative" on this question and agreed to a 
mechanism for checking on developments, and for this reason 
there is no risk that the negotiations will be affected.

<F P=106> [Christopher Lockwood report: "Tory Euro-MPs Fight Threats </F>
to Sovereignty"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- The EC Centre-Right group to which 
Britain's Conservative Euro-MPs [MEP's] are affiliated yesterday 
tabled a draft constitution that is likely to be embarrassing in 
the run-up to the June elections for the European Parliament. 
  It will also embarrass the Labour Party which, a spokesman 
said, favoured adopting the constitution as a basis for 
discussion but did not endorse all its provisions. 
  The document, if adopted, would commit Britain to abandoning 
border controls; accepting majority voting on foreign policy; 
ending the system of rotating EC presidencies, and accepting 
vast increases in the power of the European Parliament -- where 
Britain holds only 15 percent of the seats. 
  The constitution was proposed by Mr Fernand Herman, a member 
of Belgium's Centre-Right Social Christian Party, and draws 
support from much of the European People's Party (EPP), the 
loose grouping to which Tory Euro-MPs belong. 
  Mr Leo Tindemans, the Belgian leader of the EPP, said 
yesterday that he favoured adopting the constitution as a basis 
for discussion. 
  But all 32 Conservative Euro-MPs are committed to voting 
against it, in the latest rift between the pro-federalist 
parties of Europe and the British contingent, whose future in 
the EPP group is far from secure. 
  A vote on a resolution which "approves this constitution as 
a 
basis for wider discussions" and commits Parliament to circulate 
it among EC officials and member governments is expected to take 
place later today. It is likely to go through. But the chances 
of the constitution ever being adopted are remote. 
  The details are, however, a good guide to thinking among the 
Christian Democrat partners of the Conservative Party. 
  Many of the ideas are likely to surface in the run-up to 
1996, when government heads are due to decide the next stages in 
the integration of Europe. 
  Enthusiasts for federalism pointed out yesterday that the 
Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty both had their 
genesis in a similar kite-flying exercise by the Euro-Parliament 
10 years ago. 
  British Conservative Euro-MPs and officials have reacted in 
horror to some of the constitution's provisions. The proposals 
that most offend Britain's notions of sovereignty are: 
  The EC's unelected and barely accountable bureaucracy would 
have the sole right to suggest foreign and security policy 
initiatives to the European Commission. These would then go to 
an EC vote and need only be adopted by a majority. At the 
moment, votes must be unanimous, giving Britain an effective 
veto, which would disappear. 
  The European Parliament would have the sole right to elect 
the Commission president, a job which M Jacques Delors, the 
incumbent, has shown to be perhaps the most powerful in Europe. 
That decision currently rests with member states. 
  The Euro-Parliament would have the right to initiate 
constitutional reforms. 
  It would compel Britain to elect its Euro-MPs by a "common" 
European system -- inevitably a form of proportional 
representation. 
  It would replace the rotating EC presidency with a system of 
renewable one-year appointments, which would go to a vote by 
member states. This could lead to indefinite exclusion for some 
countries. 
  It would give the Parliament the right to veto any treaty 
concluded by the EC. 
  Meanwhile, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EC's information 
commissioner, revealed details of the Commission's new freedom 
of information policy, whose produres, he claimed, will allow 
the release of 99 percent of documents placed before the 
Commission. 
  The procedures will be in place by the end of the month. 
However, sceptics doubt that they will work well in practice, 
noting that last year the Commission adopted a code of practice 
which allows it almost unlimited discretion to refuse disclosure 
of internal documents.

<F P=106> [Rory Watson article: "London Opt-Outs Dent Brittan's Job </F>
Prospects"] 
  [Text] The opt-outs which British Prime Minister John 
Major gleefully negotiated from the Maastricht Treaty may, three 
years on, come back to sabotage the chances of a British 
politician succeeding Jacques Delors as Commission president. 
  In a remarkably frank outburst last December, the French 
Socialist MEP [Member of the European Parliament] Claude 
Cheysson, a former foreign minister and European commissioner, 
stated that it was inconceivable that a Briton could take on the 
top Commission post after the country had shunned monetary union 
and vast tracts of planned social legislation. 
  The attack demonstrated some of the unexpected obstacles 
that 
Sir Leon Brittan, the external economic affairs commissioner, 
who had just emerged with plaudits from negotiating the GATT 
Uruguay Round, faces in his campaign to succeed Delors. 
  This, and London's failure to win in the hosting of the 
European central bank, may be political repercussions of 
Britain's less-than-total commitment to Maastricht's goals. But 
legal repercussions of the EMU [European Monetary Union] opt-out 
are unlikely to be felt for several years. 
  Similarly, the clarifications on European citizenship, 
defence, justice and home affairs which Denmark subsequently 
negotiated to the treaty have caused the Union few legal 
difficulties. 
  But it is in the area of social policy that the Union now 
faces its greatest challenge -- a situation where legislation 
might apply to 11 members but not to the United Kingdom. London 
has been accused of trying to operate social dumping -- reducing 
social cost to attract investment from its European competitors. 
But it is the legal implications that are haunting 
policy-makers. 
  The obstacles became apparent this week with the 
Commission's 
latest proposal to establish works councils, calling on 
multinational firms in the Union with at least 1,000 employees 
to inform and consult their staff. The proposal is directed at 
employer groups and trade unions in the hope they can agree on a 
consultation mechanism. But if this fails, there may be moves 
to enforce the measures in the 11 countries that subscribe to 
Maastricht's Social Chapter. 
  Under the scheme, a multinational with branches in Britain 
could ask employers and unions to participate although the 
management would be free to refuse. More controversially, the 
Commission proposes that British-based staff of other EU 
[European Union] companies be counted when calculating whether 
the level of 1,000 employees, which activates the consultation 
measures, has been reached. British multinationals with more 
than 1,OOO staff in the Union would also have to implement the 
system, even for British staff in other EU countries, because 
the opt-out is based on territory, not nationality. 
  But governments are also unclear how such proposals should 
be 
processed. All commissioners will draft future legislation. 
All MEP's will be allowed to debate and amend such proposals, 
after a crude attempt to exclude British Conservative members 
from the process failed last month. Similarly, all members of 
the advisory economic and social committee will have their say. 
  The difficulty is in the Council of Ministers. No one 
believes that Britain should be allowed to vote on such 
legislation, but governments are divided over whether British 
ministers and officials should be allowed to participate in 
discussions influencing the eventual shape of the law, or be 
told to sit and observe. 
  There is another insidious consequence of the derogations 
governments have been prepared to grant EU countries. It makes 
it harder for the Union to say categorically to applicant 
countries that they must accept the full body of EU law and 
responsibilities when exceptions are made for current members. 
Several Austrians feel aggrieved that their efforts to control 
the sale of second homes to other EU citizens is being so 
fiercely contested when Denmark secured the very same opt-out in 
1973.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 11 (AFP) -- There will be no application 
of a safeguard clause on behalf of the fishing industry in the 
European Community, European Commission President Jacques Delors 
said in Paris on Friday [11 February] after a talk with French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. 
  He said such a clause could be applied only when "the 
European markets have been turned upside-down." 
  French fishermen have staged a series of violent 
demonstrations and protests against imports of cheap foreign 
fish, which they say prevent them from earning an adequate 
living. 
  The safeguard clause authorizes EC authorities to limit or 
halt imports of goods for limited periods if they are considered 
to destabilize EC markets to an excessive extent. 
  Delors commented that, "The safeguard clause is used when 
all 
the European markets are upside-down, unfair practices are used, 
and so on. For the time being, we've done everything that is 
legally possible. Rules are rules, and I can't violate them." 
  He said the EC had adopted minimum prices for some fish 
imports, "which was not simple because the fishing crisis, for 
the time being, is concentrated on the Atlantic coast. It is 
not like the last one, during which several countries were 
affected." 
  French authorities had said last week that they wanted 
"safeguard measures" on behalf of French fishermen, such as 
import quotas or suspensions, import license, and/or other steps. 
  On a more positive note, Delors said, "I am now going to 
propose to the European Commission that we adopt a program of 
Community initiative aimed particularly at letting the French 
fishing industry modernize and adapt to the conditions of the 
world economy. This program will allow aid to restructuring and 
in controlling markets.... We hope to enable all French 
fishermen to adapt to today's conditions."

<F P=106> [Boris Johnson report: "Britain Balks at German Plans for a </F>
`Brussels FBI'"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The Government faces a renewed struggle 
with Germany today over Chancellor Kohl's plans to create a 
full-fledged EC police force, able to mount operations anywhere 
in Britain and the rest of the Community. 
  With the first stage of Maastricht's "Europol" due to be 
formally opened in The Hague on Feb 16, disagreements have 
broken out over the detail of the body's convention, due to be 
signed this October. 
  But as the new, powerful and secretive K4 committee of 
national interior ministry officials meets in Brussels, Britain 
is preparing to enter vehement reservations. 
  Mr Anthony Langdon, Britain's representative, will tell his 
colleagues Europol should remain strictly an 
intelligence-swapping operation, similar to Interpol. 
  The prospect of "federal agents" from Germany or France 
being 
deployed in Britain is likely to cause uproar among Tory 
Eurosceptics . 
  British sources last night said they did not want "people in 
uniforms" being attached to Europol, let alone sent on missions. 
  Since its home was agreed at last October's Brussels summit, 
the organisation has consisted of about 40 officers of different 
EC nationalities, occupying rooms in the Dutch information 
ministry. The total will rise to about 70 by the end of the year. 
  At present, Europol's sole task is to pool intelligence on 
drug traffickers. Each of the seconded police and customs 
officers remains primarily loyal to his own government, with 
full discretion over whether to give out data to colleagues from 
other EC countries. 
  The question now is whether to create a more fully federal 
body, allowing all Europol operatives equal access to all 
national data. 
  This would especially enrage the Danish government, which 
has 
strong secrecy laws, and almost certainly the British as well. 
  But the Germans and the EC Commission want to go further, 
drafting the convention so that it allows for more direct action 
by Europol. 
  "If you are operating in a world where the police are not 
stopped at the frontier, the best way to do it is to have a 
Europolice force," said an EC source last night.

<F P=106> [Report signed "froe": "Euro-Spacemen Short of Funds"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- In redefining its space program, the 
European Space Agency, ESA, is counting on cooperation with the 
United States and Russia for cost reasons. At the ESA council 
meeting held in Paris on Monday [31 January], the funding of 
manned space travel could, however, not be resolved. This was 
reported by Research Minister Paul Krueger at a news conference 
in Bonn on Tuesday. 
  According to the research minister, studies and preliminary 
research work on the European contribution to the international 
space station -- working title Columbus -- are to be carried out 
by the end of 1995. After that date, a decision shall be made 
on whether Colombus is to consist of any further elements beside 
a laboratory section that can be docked with the station. By 
June 1994, ESA wants to present proposals on how ESA can 
participate in the actual construction of the space station. 
The United States and Russia agreed on a large-scale 
cooperation last year. 
  In addition, a new program for manned and unmanned 
transportation systems (MTSP) is to be worked out by the end of 
1995. MTSP is to replace the ambitious Hermes project, which 
was mainly favored by France and was canceled for cost reasons 
last year. The new four-item program includes an "intelligent 
top stage" for the efficient Ariane-5 booster for approaching 
the space station automatically, and a transport capsule, which 
is also to be transported by Ariane. Krueger said Germany will 
try to become coordinator of the intelligent top stage, and 
France wants to take the leading role with the capsule. 
  Funding has remained a controversial issue during the ESA 
meeting. The ESA financial system is based on calculation units 
that are fixed for one year. Due to changes in the ECU exchange 
rate, countries with devalued currencies have to make extra 
payments to ESA, while countries with upvalued currencies can 
expect refunds. Germany has suggested to introduce the ECU as 
calculation unit from 1 January 1997. It is expected that a 
compromise on the funding system will be reached on 15 February. 
According to ESA, some 540 million German marks [DM] have been 
allocated to Columbus during 1995/95, DM414 million to MTSP. 
Krueger emphasized that the envisaged costs for both programs 
will now only be some 40 percent of the costs estimated at the 
ESA meeting at the end of 1992. He said the German share in the 
programs will be DM120 million in 1994, and DM140 million in 
1995. For the first time, Krueger lowered the ESA share in the 
1994 research budget by DM62 million to DM1.092 trillion. 
  ESA does not seem to be planning any cuts in its utilization 
programs, which includes the environment research satellite 
Envisat. Two new meteorological observation satellites are to be 
financed by the Federal Transportation Ministry. This means 
orders worth DM400 million for German industry. 
  Josef Vosen, the Social Democratic Party of Germany research 
expert, said ESA is claiming insolvency. The financial problems 
of the devalued currency countries will mean higher 
contributions for Bonn, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Hubert </F>
Wachter; place and date not given: "National Socialist Elements 
Belong to His Program"] 
  [Text] [Wachter] Chancellor Vranitzky, election year 1994 
will probably boil down to a duel between you and the leader of 
the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], Joerg Haider. Haider 
claims to be the "secret chancellor" already at this point 
because your government is only carrying out what he has always 
demanded. 
  [Vranitzky] I am amused by his glib remarks. Is he the 
secret chancellor? I do not know and I do not care what Haider 
does secretly. Yet those who are secretly great people usually 
collect tin soldiers or sail boats in the bath tub. The truth is 
that Haider is a traditional politician. He has been telling 
the same old story for many years. He has simply not broken 
with the right- wing fringe. He has not even been able to give 
up certain National Socialist elements, like the "employment 
policy of the Third Reich." There are people who say that this 
is his problem. I claim that this is not his problem but his 
program! 
  [Wachter] Haider has accused the government of adopting 
political measures on the immigration issue that he has been 
proposing for a long time. 
  [Vranitzky] By deluding us about his goals, he has 
repeatedly adopted anti-immigrant positions. If he says that we 
must slowly send the guest workers home to create more work for 
Austrians, his proposal is either not well thought out, or he is 
not familiar with the employment situation. Let me give you an 
example: If a factory exports its goods mainly to eastern 
Europe, and if the systems are collapsing in Russian and Ukraine 
so that we can no longer sell anything there, he will still not 
sell anything even if he sends 20,000 workers home. 
  [Wachter] Haider has stated scornfully that he wants to take 
over your job in 1998, hinting that you are no longer very 
active. He described himself as the chancellor for the next 
millennium. 
  [Vranitzky] Well, this is the third element of his story. 
He is constantly talking about becoming chancellor -- always 
with a certain delay, as in a poorly dubbed film. He first 
wanted to become chancellor in 1990 when he nominated the 
unfortunate Norbert Gugerbauer as head of the FPOe. Now he 
wants to become chancellor again -- but not before 1998. Thus, 
he was defeated twice on the issue of chancellor. 
  [Wachter] You pushed Haider out to the margin of politics in 
1986. 
  [Vranitzky] I did not do that. I merely distanced myself 
from him. 
  [Wachter] Okay, you distanced yourself. What went wrong as 
far as the political strategy is concerned, if Joerg Haider, 
from whom you distanced yourself, is now your strongest rival 
and challenger? 
  [Vranitzky] Nothing went wrong. Quite the contrary. Day in 
and day out, he proves that the distancing was necessary and 
that I made the right decision in 1986. 
  [Wachter] Haider wants to focus on the immigration issue in 
the election year. 
  [Vranitzky] After the letter bomb attacks, all five party 
chairmen agreed to observe a 12-point list concerning language 
and political culture. The goal was to prevent extreme forms of 
political debate. Haider was one of the first to break the 
rules. Thus, one can hardly expect him to observe a high 
standard of politics. Yet only naive people will be surprised 
about that. 
  [Wachter] The election campaign will probably be dominated 
by "social liberality" versus "the cult of personality and a 
society where one succeeds by elbow-jostling." 
  [Vranitzky] Yes, exactly. We will stress our efforts to 
safeguard Austria's attractiveness as a business location, 
particularly our endeavors to ensure full employment. 
  [Wachter] At 300,000 unemployed? 
  [Vranitzky] Well, particularly at a time when unemployment 
is rising, we must strongly reject elbow-jostling. Social 
scientists discovered a long time ago that there are people in 
society who are losers or who consider themselves to be losers. 
Haider's strategy is to address these people. We will tell 
them clearly: We understand that you are susceptible to 
arguments from this corner. Yet do you understand that you will 
not be offered a solution from there, that your incomes will not 
be increased, that there will be no social improvement, and that 
jobs will not become safer. 
  [Wachter] Let us talk about the elections. Will we go to 
the polls in June? 
  [Vranitzky] No, there are no such plans whatsoever. 
  [Wachter] The Austrian People's Party [OeVP] has hinted that 
it wants to leave the government and go into opposition if its 
gap with the Socialist Party of Austria should increase (10 
percent difference in 1990). What would this mean for you? 
  [Vranitzky] Nothing for the time being. The OeVP will 
continue to be our coalition partner until the elections. Then 
talks will be held. By the way, the OeVP has never officially 
announced that it plans to go into opposition. There are only 
voices within the party who advocate such a step. The OeVP will 
have to think about that and make a decision. 
  [Wachter] At what "red" intensive care unit will the "black" 
patient be treated after the elections to keep it alive? 
  [Vranitzky] One cannot wage an election campaign for two 
parties at the same time. 
  [Wachter] Are you worried about the position of the OeVP? 
  [Vranitzky] I do not want to give advice or recommend 
anything to a coalition partner through the media. As the 
federal government and as parties, we must do two things: We 
must prove that we are able to do our job and we must be 
acceptable to the voters. 
  [Wachter] If the OeVP should no longer be wiling to form a 
coalition with you, you can only cooperate with the Liberal 
Forum or the Greens, or with both. There have been reports that 
you would consider such a constellation too unstable, that you 
would not be willing to lead such a coalition, and that you 
would withdraw from politics. 
  [Vranitzky] Negotiations on the future government will be 
held after the elections. I will not comment on this issue now.

  [Excerpt] Vienna -- Austria will now once more participate 
in an international peacekeeping program. At the Seibersdorf 
research center, in Lower Austria, UN personnel of the 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will 
be trained this year to inspect civilian chemical plants. The 
OPCW inspectors should thus be able to ascertain whether 
chemical weapons are being or can be produced in chemical 
plants. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by "E.M": "Austria Collects Signatures Against </F>
Temelin Nuclear Power Plant"] 
  [Text] The threat posed by the Czech nuclear power plant 
in Temelin near the border has lead to a response by the 
population: On the one hand, an advance notice of damages 
valued 3 trillion schillings has been sent from Austria to the 
U.S. company Westinghouse. On the other hand, the environmental 
organization Global 2000 is starting a large-scale petition 
campaign: It calls on the U.S. Congress to withhold financing 
of Temelin: "The nuclear power plant project has already been 
rejected by the World Bank and other banks with reference to 
cheaper and safer alternatives," the petition states: 
"Therefore, we are appealing to you not to support the 
short-term economic interests of the U.S. nuclear industry." 
  This campaign is supported by Education Minister Rudolf 
Scholten: "If signatures are collected in schools, I endorse 
that." The first prominent person to sign is [singer] Rainhard 
Fendrich. Lists for signatures can be obtained at "Global 
2000," 1120 Vienna, Flurschuetzstrasse 13, telephone 0222/812 57 
30. 
  Environmental activist Petr Hlobil of the Czech 
environmental 
organization "Children of Earth" believes that "the majority of 
the people in southern Bohemia are against the project." 
Organized resistance is already forming, according to Hlobil. 
Hlobil does not accept his government's argument that Temelin is 
necessary so that the outdated coal-fired power plants in 
northern Bohemia can be closed down. Until 1995-96 -- the 
earliest date of Temelin's coming into service -- most of the 
coal-fired power plants in the region will already have been 
closed down or improved. Only 430 of the 2,000 megawatts of 
Temelin will then be needed in northern Bohemia.

<F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister tonight set out to reassure 
Moscow that Russia and NATO shared the same aims on Bosnia. 
John Major, who leaves Britain for Russia on Monday [14 
February] for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, said: 
"Emphatically what NATO is doing is not taking sides in the 
conflict." 
  His remarks, in an interview for Russian television, came 
after Russia called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security 
Council to discuss the crisis in Bosnia following NATO's 
ultimatum to Serb forces around Sarajevo to withdraw their 
artillery within 10 days. 
  Mr Major said: "The objectives that the Russian government 
have are the same objectives that we have in the West. We would 
like to see the fighting stop, we would like to see a political 
settlement. 
  "Emphatically what NATO is doing is not taking sides in the 
conflict. That is not what we are doing. What we are concerned 
about is to stop the fighting around Sarajevo and the needless 
and ceaseless deaths that occur there. That is the purpose of 
what we are seeking to do. But the objective I believe is one 
that Russia shares -- and that is to find a negotiated 
settlement to this conflict. 
  "There is no other satisfactory ending." 
  Mr Major made his remarks shortly after he held brief talks 
at Downing Street with Russia's ambassador to London, Boris 
Pankin. 
  Earlier today, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy 
Karasin, in a mildly-worded statement, called for a negotiated 
end of the siege in the Bosnian capital. He told a briefing in 
Moscow that the Russian Federation proposed the convening of an 
immediate Security Council session to examine practical ways of 
demilitarising Sarajevo and introducing direct rule by the UN. 
His comments contrasted sharply with those earlier of Russian 
deputy foreign minister Anatoliy Adamishin. 
  Interfax quoted Adamishin as denouncing outright NATO's 
ultimatum to Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw artillery from 
Sarajevo in 10 days or face possible air strikes. 
  "Why should NATO make decisions on a (Bosnian) settlement, 
especially by way of ultimatums and threats to use force? This 
is not NATO's business. It is the job of the UN." 
  A UN Security Council session would bring what is for Russia 
a highly sensitive issue under the direct auspices of a body in 
which it enjoys a trump card -- a powerful veto right. 
  Karasin avoided any comments on Moscow's possible line at a 
Security Council meeting, should it be called.

<F P=106> [By John Clark, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said today that 
Russian concern about possible airstrikes against Serbian 
positions around Sarajevo was "perfectly understandable." 
  Mr Rifkind's comments came ahead of the Prime Minister's 
visit to Moscow on Tuesday [15 February] when Mr Major is 
expected to discuss the Bosnian situation with Russian leader Mr 
Yeltsin. 
  The Defence Secretary, speaking in Edinburgh, said: "The 
Russian government has of course been very supportive of the UN 
and supported the Security Council resolution last year under 
which the possibility of air strikes is being organised. 
  "It's perfectly understandable there should be some concern. 
Everybody is concerned about the use of force." 
  Mr Rifkind emphasised his confidence in Lieutenant General 
Sir Michael Rose, the UN force commander who is seeking to 
implement the ceasefire. He also said that the role of UN 
commanders on the ground would be extremely important in any 
decision to launch air strikes because of the risk to UN forces 
and aid workers. 
  It was not unusual that there were differing degrees of 
support for international action, he added. 
  The important point was that the Security Council took a 
decision some months ago and the latest resolution on air 
strikes was based on that. 
  "In any account I am sure the views of all the nations 
concerned will continue to be considered," said Mr Rifkind. 
  The Defence Secretary was guest of honour at the official 
opening of a new 1 million pound headquarters of the Scottish 
Yeomanry, a new Territorial Army unit created 15 months ago for 
the role of light reconnaisance and home defence.

  [Text] Britain has suspended aid convoys in Bosnia in the 
run-up to the deadline when the Serbs may face air strikes, 
Government officials said today. Officials said the British 
Government, in consultation with the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees, had halted the convoys as a "prudent 
precaution." 
  They said: "We suspended our aid convoys and we gave advice 
and assistance to aid workers to make sure that they made their 
way to safe locations against the possibility that they might 
find themselves in danger." 
  The suspension took place from Monday and the decision was 
taken as part of contingency arrangements for the safety of aid 
workers delivering supplies. 
  Officials said: "With any luck we shall be able to start 
them 
again as we have in the past." 
  But they refused to speculate on the role now of British 
troops in Bosnia, who are there to provide protection escort to 
the humanitarian operation.

  [Text] The Government is strongly opposed to sending extra 
troops and equipment to Bosnia. Ministers firmly believe that 
other members of the United Nations should first be asked to 
contribute if extra forces are required to enforce a peace 
accord in Sarajevo. 
  Britain, the second largest contributor of forces in the 
former Yugoslavia after France, is already concerned at the 
open-ended nature of the humanitarian operation. Although a 
wide range of Army units has been "earmarked" to reinforce the 
2,300-strong British contingent, none has been placed on short 
notice to move. Despite the soaring tension following NATO's 
10-day ultimatum to the Serbs to pull back artillery units from 
Sarajevo, Britain does not believe reinforcements are necessary 
at this stage. 
  Units which could be deployed in an emergency if the Serbs 
launched large-scale retaliatory attacks for air strikes include 
an infantry battalion with Saxon armoured personnel carriers and 
an artillery regiment. The battery of six 105mm light guns, 
which was returned to Britain last June after five months 
sitting off the Croatian coast, remains on notice and could be 
flown out to the region. 
  "There are a wide range of capabilities which have been 
earmarked to reinforce British troops if required depending on 
the situation but we are not prepared to discuss numbers, units 
or specific capabilities," said the Ministry of Defence.

  [Text] Claims that Britain agreed to the NATO ultimatum to 
Serb forces besieging Sarajevo only after being "leaned on" by 
the United States were fiercely denied by 10 Downing Street 
tonight. 
  The allegation is that President Clinton warned the Prime 
Minister in a 30-minute telephone call on Wednesday [9 February] 
that if Britain blocked the strategy, the United States 
commitment to NATO might be seriously undermined. 
  But senior officials denied that anything of this sort 
occurred during that phone call or elsewhere. The conversation 
was "entirely one on good terms." 
  In fact, Britain was happy to go along with this policy. 
  Even so, there remain fears among some Tory MPs that Britain 
and the West are in danger of becoming embroiled in a civil war 
by adopting a policy which could prolong the conflict, they 
fear, rather than curtail it. 
  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has said that Britain 
approached this policy with great caution. But he insists he is 
convinced that it will produce more good than harm.

  [Text] Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski 
visited London yesterday. He met and talked with Roger Roan, 
undersecretary of the British Foreign Office. They discussed 
several issues concerning the situation in the Balkans, and 
focused on the bilateral relations. The British party 
reaffirmed its interest for stabilizing the situation in the 
region and pointed out Macedonia's contribution to that. 
  During his short visit, Minister Crvenkovski also met and 
talked with the Macedonians living and working in London. He 
briefed them on Macedonia's efforts to gain international 
affirmation and its struggle to introduce stable economy in the 
country.

  [Text] The Government was investigating reports that 
British arms and mercenaries were being used by Azerbaijan in 
its conflict with the Armenians, Foreign Office Minister of 
State Baroness Chalker said today. 
  But she stressed ministers had yet to find any evidence of 
this. 
  Lady Chalker told the Lords at question time: "Officials are 
continuing to investigate the allegations published in THE 
INDEPENDENT (on January 24). 
  "We have no evidence that British mercenaries are fighting 
for Azerbaijan or that British arms have been supplied to that 
country." 
  She said Britain continued to support an international arms 
embargo and could not condone the supply of arms or mercenaries 
to either side. 
  "If there is any evidence of illegal activity, which I 
believe this to be, it should be passed to the police 
authorities for further investigation. 
  "I also believe there is a moral duty on British companies, 
and we sincerely hope no one will supply either arms or 
mercenaries to either side of this conflict or of any other."

  [Excerpt] The Belfast headquarters of the IRA's political 
wing Sinn Fein was damaged in a rocket attack today. Local 
people said a rocket was fired from a car parked across the 
street from Connelly House in the Andersonstown Road. 
  Sinn Fein said the missile went through an upstairs window 
and exploded in an office, parts of the warhead imbedding 
themselves in a wall. No-one was in the building at the time, 
but a Sinn Fein spokesman said a meeting of party members had 
been due to start there soon afterwards. 
  Last Monday [7 February] a booby-trapped grenade planted by 
the loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters was defused at the security 
gate outside the building. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams 
visited the scene soon after the attack and accused the security 
forces of collusion in today's attack and others on Sinn Fein 
members in recent years. 
  "Loyalist death squads are operating with a high degree of 
intelligence information on individuals, offices and the 
movement of Crown forces patrols," he said. He insisted Sinn 
Fein would not be intimidated or deterred by the attacks from 
its search for peace. He claimed recent attacks were carried out 
with weapons provided to loyalists by British intelligence.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Text] Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today accused the 
British Government of stalling, delaying and almost trying to 
evaporate the thrust forward to peace in Northern Ireland. 
  And, in a chilling message, he placed the blame for the lack 
of progress since the mid-December Downing Street declaration on 
the Government for refusing to clarify its contents. 
  "If John Major refuses to give clarifications then it's 
impossible for us to give a definitive response," he stressed. 
"Unless the British Government makes that small step forward 
then, I think, that Government cannot say that it is interested 
in peace. That would be a terrible tragedy for the people of 
this island." 
  The overall impression left by Mr Adams's appearance on the 
London Weekend Television Walden programme was that Sinn Fein is 
unlikely to accept the declaration. 
  And Mr Major has made it equally clear that the declaration 
requires no clarification and is not negotiable. 
  The Government has also repeatedly challenged Mr Adams's 
attempts to lay the blame at the door of the Government, saying 
all that needs to be done is for the IRA to end violence -- for 
ever. Then Sinn Fein, after some three months of peace, would 
be considered for inclusion as a constitutional Northern Ireland 
political party in the talks on the future of the province. 
  In a bleak warning today, however, Mr Adams said there would 
be conflict if the British Government continued to behave "in 
the way that we have had in the past." 
  Mr Adams, whose words were reproduced by an actor's voice, 
said: "We have asked the British Government to clarify to our 
party and to those we represent the same clarification and 
elaborations they have given to every other party. The British 
Government have stalled and delayed and refused to do that. So 
it is impossible for us to give a definitive answer to that 
Declaration when we don't have all the information about it." 
  Mr Adams described the Declaration as "a masterpiece of 
ambiguity, about which both governments have different 
interpretations." And he accused the British Government of 
having "stalled, delayed and almost, if you like, are trying to 
evaporate the thrust forward for peace." 
  Mr Adams said there would be a massive dividend for the 
British people if peace was restored. "It is British money 
which is being pumped in here, it's British reputations being 
tarnished in a whole range of international tribunals, in human 
rights bodies. The British people have to realise that there is 
a unique opportunity for peace at this time and that the 
Republicans seek to engage with their Government and the 
Government is refusing to engage with us." 
  Mr Adams said the opportunity for peace was there before and 
after the Declaration. "Are we going to allow the London 
Government to squander this opportunity for peace?" 
  All the evidence suggested the British Government did not 
want to join the persuaders, he said. "There is the exclusion 
order against me, the insulting language used by Mr Major, his 
own difficulties within his own party and his own right wing; 
all indicate that at this time the British Government may not 
want to join the persuaders." 
  So, he said, the Government had to be pressed to go the 
extra 
mile. He claimed: "I am not trying to put the onus on the 
British Government. I am trying to get it to fulfil its 
responsibility in these issues."

  [Text] Hopes that Sinn Fein will announce a ceasefire in 
Northern Ireland when it holds its annual conference in Dublin 
at the end of this month collapsed today when the party made it 
that clear its decision-making process would continue into March. 
  Sinn Fein said it would hold a public "Peace Commission" in 
Belfast a week after the conference. 
  The party -- the IRA's political wing -- has been holding 
the 
sessions all over Ireland. 
  The announcement dashed rising speculation that the British 
and Irish saw the republicans' annual gathering as the platform 
for the announcement of their response to the Downing Street 
Declaration signed by John Major and Albert Reynolds on December 
15. 
  Neither London nor Dublin has put a time limit on a Sinn 
Fein 
response. 
  But both have shown increasing signs of impatience at the 
long delay and had pinned hopes on Sinn Fein president Gerry 
Adams delivering an answer at the conference. 
  Sinn Fein spokesman Richard McAuley said today: "The 
consultation process will not be complete but it does not 
devalue the Ard Fheis (annual conference). 
  "It provides republicans in Ireland with their first 
opportunity to come together in a national forum to discuss the 
peace process." 
  But Social Democratic and Labour Party deputy leader Seamus 
Mallon predicted that the IRA would give up terrorism and that 
the republican movement would enter the political process -- 
although not yet. 
  Mr Mallon, MP for Newry and Armagh, said he was more 
convinced than ever that peace was on the way. 
  "I think they will have a cessation of violence. I think 
they are on the road to peace," he said. 
  "I think they are having difficulties in doing that and I 
did 
not expect them to have anything but difficulties. I think it 
will be longer than people think, more tortuous than people 
believe, but it will happen, I am convinced of that." 
  Mr Mallon told the BBC Radio Ulster programme Inside 
Politics 
that the cessation of violence would come from within the 
republican movement. 
  There was a "burning desire" for peace within the whole 
community and the section within the republican movement which 
wanted to continue the violence would find it impossible to 
sustain it in the face of that public desire. 
  But people should realise that it would be a slow process.

  [Text] [Announcer] Yesterday NATO members agreed on a plan 
to bomb Bosnian Serb targets unless Serbs withdraw heavy weapons 
from around Sarajevo or place them under UN control within 10 
days. The Canadian Government had opposed air strikes, out of 
concern for the safety of its 800 peacekeepers on the ground in 
Bosnia. But Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Canada had 
changed its position, in order to protect the civilian 
population in Sarajevo. 
  [Begin recording] [Chretien] The Bosnian Serbs have accepted 
to see the Canadians replaced by the Dutch before the end of 
this month. So, the situation is progressing normally there, 
and according to the news that I've heard a few minutes ago the 
Serbs have agreed to accept the ultimatum in relation to 
Sarajevo. So there will be no need for air strikes, but indeed 
we are [as heard] accepted, in order to protect the civilians in 
Sarajevo and not to see the repetition of the massacre of the 
last weekend. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Canada's 
foreign affairs minister, Andre Ouellet, says a major factor in 
Ottawa's reversal against the air strikes was a promise by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. He telephoned Prime Minister Chretien 
twice yesterday to give assurances that the U.S. will be very 
involved in the process to ensure a peaceful solution to the 
conflict.

  [Text] Military analysts say Canada will have to rely on 
other countries to protect its troops in Bosnia if they are 
attacked by Serbs. Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet says 
Canada is making contingency plans. He wouldn't specify, but 
Mr. Ouellet says Canada is working on both the military and 
diplomatic fronts. Canadian troops in the Muslim enclave of 
Srebrenica are considered to be vulnerable to possible Serb 
reprisals to NATO air strikes.

  [Text] Ottawa, Feb. 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu began his visit to Canada on Sunday [13 
February] intending to cement ties with the member of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
  He meets his Canadian counterpart Andre Ouellet on Monday 
and 
will propose ways to strengthen trade links between South Korea 
and NAFTA, including the establishment of "special cooperative 
relations," officials said. 
  They are to discuss post-Uruguay Round bilateral trade 
arrangements and regional cooperation through the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the officials said. 
  Han meets Secretary of Commerce Roy MacLaren first and is 
expected to urge Canada to extend its general preferential 
tariff (GPT) status for South Korea that ends in June, as well 
as lower import and other trade barriers to South Korean 
products. 
  He will call on Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Tuesday 
before going to the United Nations, where he plans to confer 
with Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the North Korean 
nuclear problem and possible measures by the UN Security Council.

  [Excerpts] Ottawa, Feb. 13 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States are likely to meet this week and may agree on 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, South 
Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Sunday [13 February]. 
  In Canada on a tour of North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) members, Han said he expects North Korea to come forward 
with a positive response soon. 
  "Chances are high that North Korea will reopen contact with 
the United States this week in New York and reveal its 
position," said Han. 
  Han's optimism follows a statement last Saturday by the 
North 
Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman claiming Washington has told 
Pyongyang it wants to solve the nuclear problem through dialogue 
and that North Korea also wants such a solution. 
  He called the statement "a meaningful change" on North 
Korea's part and predicted a meeting with the United States 
before the IAEA negotiations. 
  South Korean sources explained that North Korea and the 
United States have had opportunities to exchange views, although 
not in official surroundings like the New York contact. [passage 
omitted] 
  U.S. congressmen and the press have been pressing the 
administration to take punitive action against North Korea for 
refusing to submit to IAEA inspections. 
  Han, however, emphasized a diplomatic solution in his talks 
with U.S. officials last week. 
  Washington had left the inspection issue to be solved by 
North Korea and the IAEA, refusing to negotiate on behalf of the 
Agency or to meddle in details. 
  But the United States decided to reopen contact with North 
Korea this week at South Korea's urging for another try at a 
diplomatic solution, according to the sources. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "Diplomacy With an Iron Fist"] </F>
  [Text] "This is a good beginning," Bill Clinton announced. 
"Every time NATO shows determination, this bears fruit." The 
U.S. President is right. Before the alliance made its decision, 
the Serbs announced the withdrawal of heavy artillery from 
Sarajevo. Things like that have happened before. Every time the 
West thought publicly about air strikes, Karadzic and Milosevic 
behaved as though they had learned diplomacy from the 
appeasement specialist Neville Chamberlain. 
  The NATO ultimatum threatening with a military intervention 
was a good beginning, both morally and in terms of realpolitik. 
We should not forget what has been happening in Sarajevo in the 
past 22 months. "This is no civil war but a war against 
civilization, against coexistence in a multicultural and 
multireligious society characterized by tolerance," the chief 
editor of OSLOBODJENJE ("Liberation") wrote in Sarajevo. This 
kind of society existed indeed, and the fact that such 
experiments are so rarely successful makes this crime against 
civilization all the more vile. 
  Every shell that does not hit Sarajevo in the future, and 
every human being that is not killed will justify the NATO 
ultimatum. Sometimes politics is reduced to its essential core, 
which is not to create heaven on earth but to prevent Cain from 
slaying Abel. 
  Yet what will happen afterward? If the goal were only to 
destroy the Serbian artillery and to interrupt the supply lines, 
the strategists, who are watching the war from their homes, 
would not have to worry. NATO has prepared itself for day X for 
many months. It knows the targets and possesses the required 
equipment (slow, low-flying aircraft with high-precision target 
systems) for attacking the Serbs in the mountains without any 
risks. Once the television-controlled missiles and the 
laser-guided bombs are launched, the risk for Radovan Karadzic's 
supporters in Belgrade will change. Slobodan Milosevic should 
know that he cannot survive an escalation. The NATO planes can 
paralyze the remainder of Serbia's economy within a short period. 
  One thing should be clear: Those who determinedly dust off 
the slogan "political problems cannot be solved by military 
means" forget that sometimes violence can only be answered with 
violence. Of what use is the most subtle diplomacy if it is not 
supported with an iron fist? If they were honest, the 
frustrated mediators Owen and Stoltenberg would admit that in 
the event of the Bosnian war. During negotiations, reason 
prevailed only so long as the threat was there. 
  The basic problem is: To use an oft-quoted formula of Max 
Weber, politics not only has to do with ideology but also with 
responsibility. On Wednesday evening [9 February], NATO assumed 
responsibility for Sarajevo. Bosnia has become the alliance's 
ward. Yet neither the guardian nor the ward will be happy about 
the relationship. 
  What happened in Brussels was commitment by committee; in 
the 
aftermath of a massacre, the 16-member body assumed an 
obligation that such a committee can hardly fulfill -- neither 
militarily nor politically. Besides (simple) air strikes, a 
tactical nightmare is opening up. Once the Serbs are punished, 
the next target might be the expansionist Croatians and Muslims. 
Would the democratic public understand such considerations of 
balance? Military force would have to serve a political goal: 
The establishment of a more or less stable order among the 
three groups. The ultimatum was preceded by a seemingly endless 
agony. How much unity is to be expected when the mixture of 
diplomacy based on the use of force must be newly adjusted every 
day? 
  This list could be extended endlessly. Still, the most 
clever arguments expressing concern cannot be the last resort. 
It is true that a responsible policy must also explore the 
consequences, but worries about possible water damage should not 
prevent the fire brigade from the most urgent action: The fire 
must be extinguished immediately, and the lives of the people 
must also be saved immediately. Which is better: Nonviolent 
negotiations and watching how the ward is being killed, or first 
fending off the murderers and then developing a policy with the 
support of weapons? The answer is quite obvious. 
  For this reason, the NATO ultimatum was a "good beginning," 
despite all the ifs and buts. This was confirmed by the Bosnian 
Serbs before the adoption of the decision when they vowed to 
withdraw their heavy artillery. It is now important to ensure 
that the Serbs keep their promise: The threat must continue to 
exist and be carried out if need be. Otherwise the old game -- 
a short break and then even more violent attacks -- will start 
again. 
  It is true that bombs do not create a political order. Yet 
bombs can ensure the grain of credibility that the policy on 
Bosnia has lacked over the past 22 months. The combat aircraft 
must remain in the air -- and the allies will have to 
demonstrate staying power.

<F P=106> [Robert Leicht editorial: "Retaliation Is Not an Objective </F>
of War"] 
  [Text] The horrendous pictures from Sarajevo make the war 
in Bosnia omnipresent. The baseness of the perpetrators, the 
excruciating pain of the victims -- they make the world succumb 
to enormous rage, but rage that is at the same time helpless. 
Helpless Rage? Yes, because the hope is deceptive that other 
states could and will put an end to this war from the outside 
and against the will of the three parties to the war -- the 
Muslims, the Croats, and the Serbs in and around Bosnia. 
  Who could not understand that, in view of the terrible 
massacres, more and more citizens and politicians demand action, 
at least air strikes at the Serb artillery positions around 
Sarajevo? If it was indeed the Serbs, who have those 68 dead 
and more than 200 injured on their conscience. However, 
retaliation -- no matter how vital and understandable the need 
for it is -- is no motive for responsible military action. 
  Even in the storm of disgust and despair one cannot avoid 
the 
nagging questions that must be asked about the second and third 
step that will follow the first: Who is the opponent? What 
does one want and can one force him to do it definitely with 
military means? Is success likely? What effort and sacrifice 
would the fight cost? And can one politically expect one's own 
citizens to accept these sacrifices because they are in the 
interest of their state? 
  Many who are now calling for "just" air strikes on Serb 
positions avoid these questions. Behind that there is the 
double illusion that one can certainly do some good -- and worse 
things will certainly not happen because of it. 
  A few air strikes -- everybody admits that -- can neither 
end 
nor shorten, nor really influence the war in Bosnia. It will 
keep dragging on murderously, until one side wins, everybody is 
exhausted, or political insight gains ground among all three 
opponents at some time in the future. In the best case, the 
atrocities will be committed differently and in different places 
in Bosnia in the future, not so much in the limelight of the 
media. Is this a serious objective of a war? 
  Everyone says that there is no real intention to wage war 
there. In reality, however, something like "a little bit of war" 
does not exist. The result that could be achieved at best with 
surgical air strikes, namely pushing certain combat actions out 
of the world's awareness, must be weighed against the danger of 
escalating and expanding the war. If the international 
community undertakes just one direct military intervention in 
the Bosnia war, it makes itself, the United Nations, or NATO a 
direct party to the war. The UN troops, who are stationed in 
the country without heavy weapons to provide humanitarian aid, 
would continue to be unprotected targets of the Serbs. And what 
then: withdrawal of the UN soldiers, an end to humanitarian 
aid, leaving the war to itself? Or more air strikes, or even 
ground forces sent to Bosnia? There is only one military action 
that rules out the risk of further escalation -- and that is 
victory. Whoever does not want to fight to win, should keep his 
finger off the trigger. 
  Whoever wants to intervene in this war -- and be it only 
with 
"surgical" strikes, as some people imagine -- must be absolutely 
clear about the purpose and meaning of the entire operation. 
However, there is no clear goal of war. For what does Europe 
want to fight, for what should it fight in the Balkans? The 
noble phrase that the West will not recognize any borders that 
have been changed by force has long become an outdated, empty 
shell. No one is willing and able to reestablish the status quo 
ante, the starting position, by use of armed force and with 
acceptable casualties. Should the international community 
instead get entangled in fighting for some version of the plans 
for division, which are pointless anyway -- or for the 
difference between two of them? And with whom and whose 
behavior should it take sides -- with the Muslims, the Croats, 
and the Serbs, every one of whom is tactically superior in 
another place and at another time? To all these questions there 
is no clear answer to justify a serious military intervention. 
Whoever, instead, starts some air strikes himself acts 
dangerously on the basis of that helplessness that he allegedly 
wants to fight. 
  In this situation the West can have only three goals: 
  First: Preserving its own security. It is not endangered by 
the war in Bosnia. It is also absurd to claim that NATO's 
credibility is at stake. As regards its actual purpose, 
self-defense in the alliance, Bosnia has never called it into 
question. If at all, Bosnia casts doubt on the credibility of 
new out-of-area goals. 
  Second: Containing the Balkan conflict. This is difficult 
but possible. However, it would be made more difficult by 
direct intervention in Bosnia. It is very likely that the 
Russians would leave the coalition in the UN Security Council. 
  Third: Continuation of humanitarian aid. This is possible 
only if the aid workers are not turned into combatants or 
hostages of the warring parties -- e.g. through pointless 
military actions by the West. 
  This is truly no heroic program. However, it is much more 
realistic than the heroism of some tactical air strikes without 
a strategic goal. Such a concept cannot pacify Bosnia -- and 
cannot satisfy the world. After the peoples' spring of 1989 the 
world must again adjust to the terrible realization that peoples 
also wage war -- and to how horrible wars are in detail; to the 
fact that there are, by the way, conflicts where one can help 
and those where one cannot even act as a balancing influence; 
and, above all, to the fact that, before taking any action, it 
must be carefully determined what kind of conflict one is 
dealing with. 
  A terrible war is raging in the Balkans -- one of many that 
we usually like to ignore. Europe is helpless. This is true -- 
and it is depressing. However, how helpless it is would become 
completely obviously only when it engaged in a military 
intervention in this war just for the sake of pretense. And 
then, only then, would Europe bear its own guilt -- for this 
helplessness and for this war.

<F P=106> [Matthias Nass editorial: "Barbarism Can Be Countered Only </F>
by Force"] 
  [Text] Everyone feels that the war in the Balkans entered 
a new stage with the massacre last Saturday [5 February]. And 
everyone knows that the West now finally has to come to a 
decision: Does it want to counter the killing with military 
force after all, or does it capitulate to terror? 
  The West has been shying away from the decision to intervene 
for 22 months; this is how long Sarajevo has now been besieged. 
For every day since the beginning of the siege, 15 people have 
been killed. With bewilderment we watch a European city being 
strangled, the people being deprived of dignity and life. 
  Week after week the poison of growing accustomed has 
increasingly paralyzed our thinking. Whoever does not see any 
practical way out, always finds intellectual excuses for doing 
nothing. We have shouldered the burden of the unbearable 
easily; after all, one can live well in the neighborhood, even 
in times of war. What, however, are we going to answer when our 
children ask us one day: What did you do when Sarajevo died? 
  The poison of growing accustomed acts slowly, but reliably. 
Conscience gradually goes to the dogs in the process. After 
all, it has been expected to tolerate a lot during the Balkan 
war so far: 

  -  "ethnic cleansing," the driving away of 
millions from their homes in the name of nationalist 
mania; 
  -  concentration camps full of emaciated prisoners, rigid 
with terror behind the barbed wire; 
  -  mass rape as a dirty weapon 
of war and the most miserable humiliation; 
  -  hunger blockades, 
which are supposed to break the will to survive of the 
defenseless civilian population and demonstrate the helplessness 
of the UN helpers; 
  -  destroyed mosques, burned out libraries, 
bombed hospitals and schools, artillery attacks on the old city 
of Dubrovnik and the bridge of Mostar; 
  -  torture and thousands of 
brutal, vile murders. 
  Horrible pictures; they passed before our, the audience's, 
eyes. Finally, we resigned ourselves to them. Not without 
reasons of realpolitik. The arguments were provided by the 
military: The quicksand of the Balkans will unavoidably devour 
everyone who is crazy enough to intervene in the war. Thus, 
hands off. The only thing that could be done was to provide 
humanitarian aid. Even that cannot be forced. 
  After the massacre of Sarajevo the failure of this 
realpolitik has finally become obvious. Because the European 
Union, the United Nations, and NATO have not countered the 
violence with determination a single time, because every drunk 
militiaman was able to stop the UN convoys, because the blue 
helmets were permitted to record only the number of salvos fired 
while standing beside the guns, because the international 
community has acted with such terrible helplessness, it has 
practically supported new violence. 
  The moral defeat is joined by the foreign policy disaster. 
There have been too many resolutions without consequences, too 
many broken promises, too many empty threats. If the United 
Nations and NATO do not act now, either, their credibility and 
integrity will be lost for a long time. 
  Just a month ago at the summit in Brussels NATO confirmed 
its 
readiness to "carry out air strikes in order to prevent the 
strangling of Sarajevo, the protection zones, and other 
endangered areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina." On the weekend, UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali called on NATO to prepare for air 
strikes at Serbian positions. 
  Everyone knows that bombing the artillery positions in the 
mountains around Sarajevo or firing missiles at the besiegers of 
Tuzla and Srebrenica will not end the war, because military 
force can never settle this conflict. However, one must finally 
set a sign against the mass murder in Bosnia -- 200,000 dead in 
two years. "Words of dismay are no longer sufficient," Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki, the UN rapporteur for the former Yugoslavia, told 
the Geneva Human Rights Commission. 
  No sensible person will underestimate the enormous risks 
that 
a military intervention entails. The Serbs could retaliate 
against the lightly armed blue helmets and thus further endanger 
the deliveries of aid to the starving civilian population. The 
Muslims could feel encouraged in their resistance against a 
compromise at the negotiations. The NATO attacks could hit 
innocent people. The war could escalate further. 
  However, this is not likely. When U.S. President Clinton 
threatened with attacks last year, the Serbs gave in 
immediately. When nothing happened, they once again stepped up 
the pressure on the besieged towns. At the Geneva negotiations 
their aggression has always been rewarded so far, and the same 
goes for the aggression of the Croats. The negotiators of the 
European Union and the United Nations could negotiate in a much 
tougher way if the diplomatic efforts were backed up by credible 
military pressure. 
  It is a terribly difficult decision. Everyone who weighs the 
pros and cons feels torn apart. Are the potential negative 
consequences of intervention more important than the visible 
consequences of nonintervention? On the other hand: Could not 
thousands still be alive if the international community had 
thought of its responsibility in time? 
  Historical memory might make the decision of one's 
conscience 
easier: Shevaq Weiss, the president of the Israeli Knesset, 
addressed a moving appeal to the five permanent members of the 
UN Security Council: "The continuing actions of genocide in 
Bosnia are a sign of shame for human society." And he added: 
"We, as members of a people that was the victim of such 
massacres while the world looked on in silence, cannot 
participate in such a cover-up." 
  If Europe does not want to betray its civilization once 
again 
in this blood-soaked century, it must counter the barbarism with 
military force.

<F P=106> [Jorn Mikkelsen report: "Germany Admits That It Has a </F>
Special Political Responsibility"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- "After reunification Germany now has a very 
special responsibility to contribute to the creation of peace 
and security in the world. All of our efforts in the field of 
foreign policy are directed toward living up to this 
responsibility. We Germans have an unfortunate tendency to 
worry about ourselves first and foremost. But be sure that we 
are reminding ourselves the whole time that we now have this 
special responsibility." 
  This is how German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel explains 
the 
difference between the new Germany's past and present, between 
self-repression and newly found self-confidence, using a formula 
that typically enough also aims at reassuring its neighbors, 
which include Denmark. 
  In everything that he does Klaus Kinkel must the whole time 
bring in this element of reassurance. 
  Its neighbors look critically and closely at the enlarged 
Germany at the heart of Europe with its 80 million inhabitants 
and enormous economic power. 
  In a meeting with a group of foreign correspondents, 
including BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's, in Bonn yesterday Kinkel took a 
grand tour through a number of today's major foreign policy 
questions. 
  The thread running through his remarks is that Germany is 
not 
what it was, but that at the same time there will always be 
limits to what it can become. No one should think that Germany 
wants to play the role of a world power. 
  "Today we are able to take on a responsibility which we 
could 
not only a few years ago. We are contributing to the UN 
peacekeeping forces in several countries. But there are still 
remnants of the conditions which used to prevail. Our 
constitution forbids us to take part in NATO's out-of-area 
actions and there will always be historically determined 
restrictions. For example, German troops will never be able to 
take part in either peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions in 
the former Yugoslavia. 
  "Germany will never become a world power. This is also true 
in the financial field. Many people take the view that Germany 
should give extra economic support to the world's crisis 
regions. Let me remind you that Germany is the third largest 
contributor to the United Nations. Germany meets 26.5 percent 
of the EU's [European Union] budget. We have signed up for 60 
percent of the aid to the former Soviet republics. There is a 
limit and we have reached it. We cannot be the whole world's 
banker," Kinkel said. 
  He puts the integration into Europe of the states of Eastern 
and central Europe high on his agenda. 
  "You are hardly likely to find a West European foreign 
minister who pleads these countries' case so unambiguously. I 
can understand that they think that things are moving too slowly 
in relation to NATO and the EU; that they are not satisfied. On 
the other hand new walls must not be built in Europe. We must 
also take the former Soviet republics into consideration. This 
is a peculiar balancing act for Germany. We are being subjected 
to particularly great pressure, because people think that we 
have a particular duty. I would say to all parties: Things 
cannot move more quickly than they are doing at present." 
  Kinkel said that he is following developments in Moscow with 
a certain amount of concern. In particular Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, who by turns has threatened Germany with nuclear 
war and promised the return of East Prussia, is giving cause for 
concern. 
  "He has made a series of fairly unusual statements. We 
think that the reformist forces in Moscow should take him on 
politically themselves. This is an internal Russian problem. I 
as foreign minister am responsible for the fact that Mr 
Zhirinovskiy cannot get an entry visa for Germany. And I stand 
by this decision." 
  Germany's view of the war in the former Yugoslavia was given 
great prominence. The Bonn government's traditionally good 
relations with Croatia are often criticized; even by NATO 
partners such as France and Britain. However, Kinkel made it 
clear that Germany's policy toward the Balkans is being 
reformulated: 
  "It is correct that we saw Serbia as the driving force 
behind 
the incomprehensible tragedy that is taking place. But little 
by little it has become more difficult to differentiate." 
  Kinkel is unwilling as yet to comment on reports that 
Croatian government forces are taking part in the fighting in 
Bosnia. 
  He was unwilling to say whether, if this is true, Germany 
will be involved in introducing economic sanctions against 
Croatia. 
  He was also reluctant to call for bomb attacks on Serbian 
positions or UN intervention: 
  "We Germans cannot allow ourselves to hand out too many 
pieces of good advice. We cannot after all take part in such 
actions. My basic view is that without a desire for peace on 
the part of the parties involved it is impossible for others to 
create a lasting peace." 
  Kinkel stressed European policy as the nucleus of Germany's 
overall foreign policy. He could not even bring himself to 
comment on the suggestion that the signals have been somewhat 
confused recently as a result of Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund 
Stoiber's tough attacks on Brussels. Germany's place is in 
Europe and the Union. We will never see Germany going it alone 
again, he said. 
  "Germany takes over the EU presidency in the latter half of 
the year. At the moment the most crucial thing is to get the 
four applicant countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria) 
into the Union. I am optimistic. There are special problems in 
the case of all four. But just think how nervous people were 
prior to the referendums in France and Denmark. But things 
turned out well! On 1 January 1995 these four countries will be 
members of the EU. I am sure of it. For none of them can allow 
itself to remain outside. And we on our side have a clear 
interest in their joining. But we must also be allowed to say 
that the four countries themselves must have a desire to join." 
  Kinkel made the following comment on the particularly 
Danish, 
slightly foot-dragging behavior in EU cooperation: 
  "It was clear to me the whole time that Denmark really could 
not allow itself to remain outside Union cooperation. 
Particularly not when it became apparent that the other 
Scandinavian countries were standing in line to join." 
  According to his own diagnosis, Kinkel is a clear friend of 
the Nordic area. 
  "I feel very at home in the Nordic countries. In this 
respect I as a southern German am fairly northern European. I 
often take vacations there. The fact that I attach so much 
importance to this region's joining the EU is due to 
considerations of internal balance in the EU. The Union will 
benefit from being properly balanced because of the Nordic 
countries' membership." 
  Kinkel rejected categorically the suggestion that German 
reunification could drive a wedge between Germany and the United 
States, because Germany's interests can be said to have shifted 
to the east. 
  "German-U.S. relations are so good that they will be able to 
withstand all disturbances. Personally I still remember how, 
immediately after the last war, American trucks rolled into the 
school yard and distributed food. That's how I got my first 
football. We will never forget the Berlin airlift (in 1948 -- 
editorial note) or the unreserved U.S. support for reunification. 
  "The United States is the world's only remaining superpower. 
It is true that after the Cold War both the United States and 
Europe are seeking their roles more in domestic policy. But 
this does not mean that we are disconnecting ourselves from each 
other. There will also be increased economic competition -- 
think of GATT, for example. But this will not put a political 
burden on transatlantic ties. The United States and Europe, the 
United States and Germany belong together."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Karl-Ludwig </F>
Guensche; place and date not given: "Kinkel: Yeltsin Must Take 
Certain Things Into Consideration"] 
  [Text] [Guensche] Minister, the characteristic feature of 
Germany's Russia policy is the motto "massive aid to strengthen 
the reformers." Has this policy not failed? 
  [Kinkel] Certainly not. There is no alternative to this 
policy. To support the reform forces is not only Germany's 
policy but all significant countries pursue the same course. 
What we must achieve in Russia is that the developments toward 
law-governed and market-economy structures become irreversible, 
and that the revolutionary process comes to a standstill -- or, 
at least, to a consolidation so that this huge, important 
country can embark on quieter tracks. 
  [Guensche] The figureheads among the reformers have 
abandoned ship.... 
  [Kinkel] That is not quite true either. You are obviously 
alluding to Gaydar and Federov. It is true that the resignation 
of the two men was not a good signal because both had a good 
reputation in the West, for example at the IMF, the World Bank, 
among economic experts, and because one thought that they would 
be capable of implementing the necessary economic reforms that 
are so decisive for the political success of the Russian 
reforms. Yet, the real figurehead for the Russian reforms is 
President Yeltsin. 
  [Guensche] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has spoken of the end 
of the market romanticism.... 
  [Kinkel] Some of Mr. Chernomyrdin's recent remarks, if he 
really made them in the way they were received outside, were 
indeed somewhat irritating. Still, I think that he supports 
Yeltsin's policy. 
  [Guensche] Mr. Illrionov, Chernomyrdin's economic adviser, 
has given up this week. Are all these events not serious 
warning signals? 
  [Kinkel] Yes, they are warning signals. However, could 
anybody really expect the enormously difficult Russian 
transformation process from dictatorship to democracy, from 
total controlled economy to the market economy to have taken 
place rapidly and without any problems? My answer is: no. 
Problems, adjustments, setbacks were bound to occur. Still, 
this must not influence our policy of support for the reform 
forces. I repeat that I do not see any alternative to this 
policy. 
  [Guensche] Is it not also a warning sign when President 
Yeltsin announces that he would defend more strongly the 
interests of the 25 million Russians living in the "immediate 
neighborhood," that is to say in the former Soviet republics? 
  [Kinkel] Yeltsin is under pressure from the conservatives 
and extremists. He must take certain things into consideration. 
What you are referring to is not nice and must neither be 
belittled nor dramatized. 
  [Guensche] Your counterpart, Kozyrev, claims a protective 
function for Russia in the Baltics, and has spoken of Russia's 
"special role" on the territory of the old Soviet Union. Does 
this not point to a U-turn in the former position? 
  [Kinkel] Russia's relations with the Baltic countries are 
particularly sensitive as a result of the minority problems, the 
issue of the withdrawal of Russian forces, and the somewhat 
unfortunate legal regulations for Russians living in the Baltic 
countries. Still, we must not accept Russia's claims of 
hegemony. 
  [Guensche] Is this not exactly what we did in the case of 
the NATO decision? 
  [Kinkel] No, we have always said -- and I am doing it again 
-- that Russia cannot claim a veto right regarding the getting 
closer to NATO or membership of Central and East European 
reformist countries. Nevertheless, it is also in the interest 
of those countries that, by creating a new European security 
architecture, we avoid opening up new gulfs between Russia, the 
CIS countries, and the Central and East European countries. 
  [Guensche] Do you not sometimes get the feeling that Russia 
is trying to resuscitate the old Soviet Union in a new form? 
  [Kinkel] I am building on the success of the reform forces, 
who do not want that. Once again: One cannot be happy about 
some tendencies that began to emerge recently. The success of 
the extremists in the election is not something, either, that 
would strengthen confidence in this large and important country. 
Still, we must not lose patience and not expect too much too 
rapidly. 
  [Guensche] How reliable is Yeltsin for you as a partner? 
  [Kinkel] Yeltsin personifies and articulates the reform 
forces. We are banking on him and we hope that Yeltsin will 
hold his own, which is why we support him. 
  [Guensche] Even people close to Yeltsin admit that the 
president is ill. Do you have any information on how ill he is? 
  [Kinkel] No. 
  [Guensche] What is your very personal prediction for the 
developments in Russia? 
  [Kinkel] I am hopeful that things will turn out well. We 
want to contribute everything we can to it.

<F P=106> [Report by "C.G.": "Kinkel Warns Moscow Against Returning to </F>
Old Behavioral Pattern"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 11 Feb -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
warned Russia against disregarding the rights of neighboring 
states. In an address to the German-Russian Forum in Bonn, 
Kinkel said that Germany wants a Russia that is open to the 
world, stable, and democratic, a country that can be a 
competitive economic partner and a reliable pillar in an 
all-European peace system. "This would be the best security 
guarantee for our entire continent." However, it cannot be 
ignored that there are forces in Russia whose ideas of their 
country's role are fundamentally different. "Those people in 
Russia who believe they could improve their rating at home by 
falling back to behavioral patterns in foreign policy from the 
Soviet era that everybody thought were part of the past, must 
know that they risk new isolation and confrontation." Germany 
is taking seriously the spirit and letter of the UN Charter, the 
Final Act of Helsinki, and the Paris Charter: "We expect Russia 
to do the same." Germany wants to extend cooperation, but 
remains determined in its defense of fundamental behavioral 
standards for European security: "In the new Europe there is no 
room for so-called spheres of vital interests." 
  Germany's policy toward the other countries in Central and 
East Europe and on the territory of the former Soviet Union 
pursues independent objectives, Kinkel said. He referred to the 
worries of those countries: "It would be fundamentally wrong to 
see them as tools for our Russia policy." Germany was aspiring 
toward ever-closer integration of its Eastern neighbors into the 
Euro- Atlantic forms of stability, "which will finally also 
include full membership." Russia should be integrated into these 
"security structures." If the smaller Eastern neighbors were to 
grow into the security structures, then the relations with the 
other countries in the East must be intensified at the same 
time. For Russia the growing together of Europe does not 
constitute a threat but an increase in stability, security, and 
economic opportunities. Kinkel warned Moscow against taking 
steps of its own in the conflicts in the Caucasus or other 
bordering areas: "When it comes to settling bloody conflicts in 
the CIS, we have to ensure that peacekeeping missions are 
carried out under the auspices and the principles of the CSCE; 
this requires the agreement of all parties involved." Ambiguous 
terms such as "immediate neighborhood" do not fit into our time: 
"As Europe is growing together we are all becoming the 
immediate neighborhood for one another; Russia does not 
constitute a special case here." Besides, the term "immediate 
neighborhood" was blurring the differences between individual 
CIS states. For all states on the area of the former Soviet 
Union the following must apply without any restrictions: "Full 
respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
inviolability of existing borders." Kinkel said that it was the 
task of Russian diplomacy to build up relations with Moscow's 
new neighbors that are based on trust and mutual respect: "That 
is a crucial issue for Europe." 
  Nowhere were people reacting more sensibly to Russia's 
position toward Europe than in the Baltics and in Ukraine. 
Kinkel requested: "The remaining Russian forces must leave 
Latvia and Estonia by the end of August 1994." The Baltics 
could constitute the first proof that openness toward the world 
and cooperation in partnership are superior to a way of thinking 
that is guided by spheres of influence and hegemonic privileges. 
Kinkel added: "Therefore, I am in favor of consistently 
connecting the Baltic states to the European Union." Estonia, 
Latvia, and Lithuania need associated membership agreements 
including the same "entry prospects" that are contained in the 
existing Europe agreement with Poland and Hungary. "No threat 
but a lasting impulse for parallel developments in the 
neighboring Russia will emanate from the Baltics that feel safe 
and begin to prosper." However, Russia does have a legitimate 
interest in preventing discrimination against Russian 
minorities. Germany has advocated reasonable conciliation 
consistent with the CSCE rules; the efforts by the CSCE's 
minority commissioner have been "quite successful." Kinkel 
recommended Russia and Ukraine to conclude a comprehensive 
agreement on good neighborly relations, border guarantees, and 
minority protection to ease tense relations. 
  "Russia is of vital importance for European security," 
Kinkel 
said. Russia remains the most important country in Europe and 
Asia. "Ecological problems and disasters in this part of our 
continent will not leave us unaffected." Like every other 
country, Russia is pursuing interests of its own that are not 
always and everywhere identical with Germany's: "A self-assured 
Russia is not necessarily a threat; conversely, a Russia that is 
cooperative is not necessarily an easy partner." What is 
necessary is a business-like policy of accommodation of 
interests and continuously growing confidence. 
  The resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar and Finance 
Minister Fedorov created doubts about the new government's 
reform course and its will to carry on with the reforms: "There 
is now a threat of a loss of confidence, not only at the level 
of international financial institutions but also that of foreign 
investors and the population at home." Since the beginning of 
the year, the ruble lost one-quarter of its value abroad. The 
flight of capital from Russia is assessed at more than $1 
billion per month. Unless Russian economic policy manages to 
create investment opportunities at home, it cannot expect too 
much from foreign capital. Kinkel said that one must hope that 
the statements by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin that the reforms 
would continue will be decisive for the course of the new 
government. The G7 stand by their financial support, but these 
alone are not enough to create the necessary structural changes 
in Russia. Kinkel added: "But there will not be more money for 
less reform." The federal foreign minister argued: "Regarding 
our support for the reforms we have to keep a balance between 
our own fundamental convictions and what can be expected from 
the people in Russia." Apart from stabilizing the national 
economy a system of social security independent of enterprises 
is recommended. Only then can the course of reform gain wide 
support. Yet, without reforms lasting improvement of social 
conditions will not be possible. With almost 90 billion German 
marks [DM], Germany has contributed most for Russia and more 
than half of the entire international aid. Germany is in favor 
of Russia's getting closer to the OECD. "We would welcome it if 
Russia were to become a member of the Council of Europe." 
Russia should become a partner with equal rights in the G7. 
Germany was also supporting the efforts for early conclusion of 
negotiations on a cooperation agreement between the EU and 
Russia. In 1994, Germany will open consulates in Kaliningrad 
(former Koenigsberg), Saratov, and Novosibirsk and is anxious to 
increase exchange in all spheres.

<F P=106> [Report signed "uhl": "Rexrodt: Taboos Challenged for </F>
First Time"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The views of what concrete actions have to 
be taken to secure the future of the German economy and society 
are converging. This opinion was expressed by Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP], at the beginning of the forum on safeguarding 
Germany as a business and investment location, which was 
sponsored by his ministry. 
  For the first time in decades, taboos are being challenged, 
intellectual inflexibility is easing, and bureaucratic 
ossification in industry and trade is being tackled. The main 
task is to get the discrepancy between costs and output under 
control and to improve the conditions for excellence in the 
spheres of education, science, technology, and development and 
their translation into successful products. 
  Apart from that, individual responsibility in the social 
sphere must increase and "work, which is abundant," must "lead 
to lasting employment." The struggle against unemployment is 
the government's most important goal. There are no patent 
prescriptions, "we must embark upon the stony path of structural 
renewal." 
  Uwe Jens, economic-policy spokesman for the Social 
Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] Bundestag group, however argued that 
"show events cannot replace competent economic policy." The 
repeated attacks against the foundations of the social market 
economy by the FDP and its economics minister are only intended 
to conceal the years of deficiencies regarding the strengthening 
of the growth forces and the economy's competitive strength. 
  Horst Koehler, the head of the Savings Banks Association, 
pleaded for a tax system that is more appropriate to promote 
hard work and the "purification" of state administration. The 
FRG will no longer be a net exporter of capital for an extended 
period of time. Hence, the confidence that was gained in 40 
years has to be "carefully cultivated." 
  The Federation of German Trade Unions [DGB] proposed a 
"five-path strategy." The "solid starting position" of German 
enterprises, for example in environmental, energy, and 
communications technology, as well as microelectronics or 
biotechnology must be further developed with the help of an 
"innovation impetus." In addition, the country needs an 
education and qualification offensive and employment initiative 
in terms of economic, industrial, and regional policy. 
  Active labor market policy must replace the financing of 
unemployment through the financing of socially sensible work. 
As for wage policy, the system of independent wage talks must 
be preserved, and area wage agreements must be geared toward 
modernizing branches and regions.

<F P=106> [DIE WELT report: "Controversy Over Labor Market Policy"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- After the two-day business location forum, 
FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt has struck a positive 
balance in the talks and advocated a further dialogue between 
politicians, the economy, and trade unions. In the discussion, 
it was the majority's opinion that the present problems of the 
German economy cannot be overcome by an economic recovery alone. 
It is particularly important for him that it was no longer 
discussed "whether" deregulation, privatization, and the opening 
of the market are to be carried out "but how" this is to be 
done, Rexrodt said. 
  In the opinion of Michael Glos, chairman of the Christian 
Social Union [CSU] land group, the business location forum has 
proven that Bonn's policy with its 30-point action program is 
correct. It is now the turn of both sides of industry to 
contribute their share to more flexibility and efficiency 
regarding working hours and wage costs. 
  At the same time, the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] sharply criticized the Bonn coalition. SPD Deputy 
Chairman Oskar Lafontaine reproached it for its "complete 
failure" in economic and financial policies. A comprehensive 
growth and employment concept has to be immediately developed. 
In return, Friedrich Bohl (Christian Democratic Union), 
minister in the Chancellor's Office, called on the Saarland 
minister president "to put the economic policy of his land in 
order first before he hands out advice to the government." Bohl 
advocated the promotion of more part-time work. In the 
Netherlands, 34 percent of all jobs are part time and in the 
FRG, it is only 17 percent, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by Eugen Georg </F>
Schwarz and Bettina Baeumlisberger; place and date not given: 
"The Government Must Travel the Country"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] Confidence in the coalition is dwindling 
and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is gaining a 
lot of sympathy. How can the Christian Social Union [CSU] 
counteract this? 
  [Waigel] What we have brought about politically in Bonn is 
not at all bad --in particular, fiscal and monetary policy, 
health reform, the postal service, and development aid. In 
concrete terms: the government's strict consolidation course, 
equalization of financial burdens between the Federal Government 
and the laender, the law to secure business location Germany, 
health, railway, and postal reforms, and asylum laws. We are 
still competent in all these areas, and the SPD is not. 
  [FOCUS] According to all the opinion polls, the majority of 
voters sees this quite differently. 
  [Waigel] This does not scare me. If I were to ask the 
people who has the necessary experience in health matters, seven 
out of 10 would say: Horst Seehofer, not Rudolf Dressler. As 
far as the debate on postal reform goes, the voters do not know 
anyone in the opposition who has commented on that matter. 
  [FOCUS] But you cannot gloss over the low morale. 
  [Waigel] It is, of course, right that nine months before the 
general elections, we are going through difficult and unsteady 
times and that the government and the coalition have to mobilize 
all their forces to deal with our political opponents. So far, 
they have hardly ever done that and have been busy with 
themselves. It no longer makes sense to work our way from 
coalition circle to coalition circle, from mediation committee 
to mediation committee. Due to the agonizingly slow 
decisionmaking processes, the results of these actions are no 
longer credited to the government. 
  [FOCUS] How do you want to change this? 
  [Waigel] It is a matter of doing what can be done. In 
nursing insurance, for instance, a decision has to be taken 
during the next few weeks: Is there still something to do or not. 
  [FOCUS] There is not much to do in other areas either. Most 
people seem to have lost hope that the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU]/CSU can lead them out of the recession. 
  [Waigel] Everyone should know that the reasons that brought 
about the recession, and thus the strict austerity measures, 
could not have been influenced and were no responsibility of the 
government: the structural crisis of the economy, European 
problems, reunification, loss of the East European markets. 
  [FOCUS] However, the question "How can the government lead 
us out of this misery?" remains unanswered. 
  [Waigel] I see this quite differently. Our fiscal and 
economic policy has resulted in the first signs of economic 
recovery. This year, we will certainly have some economic 
growth again. The interest rates on the capital market are 
lower than ever before and offer a good starting point for 
investment. The inflation rate is declining, possibly to below 
3 percent this year. There have been tax reliefs for companies. 
All these factors will strengthen the positive economic trend. 
But, we must also say this: Politics is not responsible for 
everything that happens in the economy, especially not for 
things resulting from false wage policies. Reasonable wage 
settlements are necessary. Strikes are the last thing we need 
in this situation. 
  [FOCUS] As finance minister, you are the best hated 
politician in Bonn because, with your strict austerity measures, 
you are after people's purses. How do you cope with that? 
  [Waigel] Without severe public savings, the problems cannot 
be solved. Anyone who does not understand this should suggest 
an alternative. Savings are always expected to hit the others: 
If I cut social benefits, they call me a "cold social killer." 
If I cut the Bundeswehr budget, then security is endangered. 
If I cut research, I endanger technological progress. Wherever 
I cut, I do the wrong thing because I cannot do it right, since 
I have to save 70 billion German marks [DM] everywhere. The 
necessity to save is accepted, but the willingness to save in 
one's own sector leaves much to be desired. The debate on 
saving is a phony one. 
  [FOCUS] Are you talking about the SPD? 
  [Waigel] I am particularly annoyed with those who did not 
want reunification in 1989-1990. Like Mr. Lafontaine, who can 
redevelop debt-ridden Saarland with the government's help of DM8 
billion, or take Mr. Scharping, who secured DM219 million in the 
solidarity pact negotiations to finance political leadership in 
his land. Both these gentlemen now add these sums to the 
federal debts and cry out: Look at Theo Waigel's enormous debts. 
They are the biggest hypocrites in the debate. I will deal 
with this very intensively during the next few months. 
  [FOCUS] You are painting a very positive picture of the 
government's work. Why do you think the coalition is no longer 
supported by the majority of the population? 
  [Waigel] Did Adenauer and Erhard let themselves be 
influenced by opinion polls? How often did Franz Josef Strauss 
have to weather the storm. They had a clear conscience and the 
courage to do what they thought was right in Germany's interest. 
We also have a clear conscience, because this government 
achieved more over the last four years than any other government 
over the last 30 years. This is why we have to stand up and 
say: This is the balance, these are the challenges we are 
facing, and this is Germany's role in the world. 
  [FOCUS] But who is to say this? 
  [Waigel] The chancellor must say it. 
  [FOCUS] But he would not do it. 
  [Waigel] He will do it, but everyone else in the government 
has to do it as well. The cabinet must not withdraw to a corner 
and sulk, but its members have to travel the country and wake 
people up. We have to convince people that our chances for a new 
beginning have never been so good before. 
  Germany is facing a big challenge, just like in 1948. The 
SPD is only winning sympathies in opinion polls because it does 
not make any specific statements on any problems and only stirs 
up dissatisfaction. 
  [FOCUS] Can you give us an example? 
  [Waigel] The new asylum law was not passed five years 
earlier -- as would have been necessary -- as a result of the 
SPD's refusal to cooperate. If the nursing insurance fails, it 
will be because there are Social Democrats who would prefer to 
make it a topic in the election campaign. Anyone who condemns 
monetary and fiscal policies without telling the voters how he 
would come to grips with the deficits is stirring up emotions, 
but he is not making politics. And the opposition does, of 
course, not say a word about Helmut Kohl's foreign policy. 
Germany's relations with other countries have never been so 
good before. 
  [FOCUS] But still, the vast majority of Germans do not 
appreciate this. 
  [Waigel] We have to make it clear to the voters that it does 
not do any good to go to the polls or vote for a splinter or 
even a radical party out of protest. Splitting up the political 
forces does not bring about a solution to the problems. It is 
quite simple: either us or Weimar.

<F P=106> [Report signed "cpm": "Moderate Optimism About Economic </F>
Development for 1994"] 
  [Text] Kassel, 9 Feb -- Helmut Hesse, president of the 
Land Central Bank in Bremen, Lower Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt, is 
"moderately optimistic about the economic development" in 1994, 
which is based on the expectation of a perhaps increasing export 
volume. Speaking to the Northern Hesse Marketing Club in 
Kassel, Hesse paid tribute, however, to the intensity with which 
in Germany -- as in no other European country -- the companies 
and working people are successfully trying to overcome the cost 
crisis. Working people are willing to accept lower wages to 
preserve jobs. However, it is unclear whether this is going to 
be enough to ensure traditional market shares, said Hesse, who 
was a member of the expert council for assessing overall 
economic development, the "Five Wise Men," from 1985 to 1988. 
  According to Hesse, private consumption, which contributes 
57 
percent to the overall national product, will decline by 0.9 to 
1.5 percent this year compared with 1993. One cannot expect any 
stimuli for demand from the state, either. State consumption 
will change by minus to plus 1 percent compared with last year. 
Because of low interest rates and high rents only building 
investments will increase by 1 to 2 percent. 
  In the economist's view, the international economic 
development has jump-started again. Even though the world trade 
volume will increase by up to 5.5 percent, Germany will benefit 
from that only at a below-average rate, because in Europe, the 
main buyer of German exports, the economy will grow by only 1.5 
percent. In addition, Germany primarily exports equipment, 
which is not yet so much in demand. 
  For the coming years Hesse predicted rising and 
consolidating 
unemployment. This year the number of unemployed will grow by 
about 0.5 million. If the forecasts of the Ifo Institute, which 
predicts an economic growth of 1.8 percent over the next three 
to five years in West Europe, become reality, "we will not have 
any increase in employment worth mentioning over the next 
years," because the number of employed increases only above a 
growth of about 1.7 percent. 
  Even though this may be politically difficult to implement, 
there is no way of avoiding major regional and sectoral wage 
differentiations. The wages in the lower wage groups were 
raised so much in the past that the respective jobs are no 
longer competitive. In addition, stimuli must be given for 
returning to employment, even if the new jobs offer worse 
conditions than the old ones that have been lost.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bernhard Jagoda, head of the Federal </F>
Employment Office, by Adelbert Reif; place and date not given: 
"`The Situation Is Explosive'"] 
  [Text] [Reif] Let us assume that the Federal Employment 
Office were to cease to operate. What consequences would that 
have? 
  [Jagoda] No one would be able to determine what the level of 
unemployment, which is soaring, was. Millions of people would 
not receive any unemployment benefit. Advice on careers, 
qualifications, occupational rehabilitation -- all those things 
would be gone. Apart from that, in 1993, which was a difficult 
year for the economy, we found jobs for 700,000 people in the 
new laender. In the old laender, we found employment for over 2 
million people. Is that not something? 
  [Reif] Private employment agencies could also do that. 
  [Jagoda] Not, they would not be able to. I am not being 
pigheaded when I say that a partial privatization of the labor 
market will not yield any results. Incidentally, we can 
scarcely talk of the Federal Employment Office having a 
"monopoly" if the state service accounts for 30 percent of the 
jobs that are found while newspaper advertisements and 
information by word of mouth account for 70 percent. That is 
perfectly all right. We are pleased whenever anyone finds a 
job. My great skepticism with regard to private employment 
agencies stems from the justified assumption that we will not 
have more jobs as a result. If we end up with private 
employment agencies and they function, then they will absorb a 
lot of the people who are looking for jobs through us. We will 
lose a clear picture of the overall situation on the labor 
market. We offer people looking for work the opportunity to 
inform themselves extensively about the jobs that are on offer 
via computer. Once someone has that information, he can 
initiate the application process himself. 
  [Reif] Have we not arrived at a point where there is too 
much state control? 
  [Jagoda] Privatization must make sense and result in 
success. The privatization of the labor market will not 
contribute to a reduction in unemployment. 
  [Reif] Why not? 
  [Jagoda] Because it will result in agencies taking the pick 
of the bunch and in a kind of revolving-door effect. Private 
agencies will increase the amount of rotation on the labor 
market. So, what we will find on the labor market is not that 7 
million changes have been registered, but 7.2 million or 7.3 
million changes. The unemployed, however, will remain on the 
sidelines of this process. In other words, for those providing 
such services, it will be more convenient to assist people in 
changing jobs. On the other hand, those people who are in 
difficulty because of their age or qualifications will find it 
harder to obtain employment. 
  [Reif] Let us be honest for once. The Federal Employment 
Office is nothing other than a costly, bloated, bureaucratic 
institution that uses up enormous amounts of taxpayers' money. 
  [Jagoda] A certain degree of bureaucracy is necessary to 
achieve things in a highly industrialized state. However, the 
state administration constantly suffers from the shortcoming 
that it is dependent on lawmakers. For example, when we read 
what new decisions lawmakers have produced in the 
BUNDEGESETZBLATT between Christmas and New Year, and then have 
already changed a million of our decisions accordingly at the 
beginning of January, I cannot say anything negative about the 
Federal Employment Office in connection with bureaucracy. 
  [Reif] It is rather too easy to pass the buck to Bonn. 
  [Jagoda] Well look, almost daily, we receive new 
instructions that have to be translated into practice. It is 
not child's play. If I am not mistaken, the Law on Promoting 
Employment has been amended 11 times by important pieces of 
legislation and over 50 times as a result of other legislation 
since 1969. At the same time, we seek to simplify things 
wherever possible. There are many directives, instructions as 
well as laws and decrees that we try to translate into practice 
in a simplified form. In addition, we are continually making 
organizational decisions with a view to slimming down and 
decentralizing. Thus, as of 1 January 1994, we have made 
budgetary provisions for job-creation measures, further 
training, retraining, and rehabilitation at each individual 
employment agency. So, the administration of every employment 
agency not only knows what its budget for 1994 is, but, at the 
same time, has received allotments for 1995 and 1996. 
  [Reif] Despite the dramatic increase in unemployment, you 
now have less money at your disposal than before. 
  [Jagoda] It is true that we have much less cloth for cutting 
our coat. However, I would not like to give rise to the 
impression that we do not have any money with which to provide 
help. Whoever is unemployed, even in November or December 1994, 
can count on us. We are always able to meet our financial 
obligations. Our budget now amounts to 107.2 billion German 
marks [DM], of which over DM50 million is for the payment of 
unemployment benefit. 
  [Reif] How do you assess your job in international terms? 
  [Jagoda] Compared to other industrialized countries, I 
believe that we not only provide precise statistics, but also 
set a certain standard through our active labor market policy 
and our punctuality regarding payments. 
  [Reif] There are grave doubts precisely about how exact 
your statistics are. In reality, there are said to be almost 9 
million people unemployed, rather than 4 million.... 
  [Jagoda] I am surprised that the figure is so modest. 
Seriously, however, everything depends on how unemployment is 
defined and one's basis for making calculations. If I say that 
everyone between the ages of 15 and 65, or between the ages of 
14 and 65, 68, or 70 wants to work, then the number of 
unemployed will, of course, be much higher. Then, I can also 
include all students and all those attending further training or 
retraining courses by saying that they constitute "concealed 
unemployment." That is something that I simply consider 
impermissible. By pursuing further training or retraining, 
these "unemployed" people are preparing themselves to enter the 
normal work process tomorrow. You can be sure that the number 
of people registered as unemployed that we give is correct. I 
am firmly opposed to this juggling with horrific figures, which 
is intended to cause panic among the public. The lesson of our 
century teaches us that people have a pain threshold, and if one 
sets a certain pain threshold that is not one in reality, then I 
believe that to be irresponsible in terms of social policy. 
  [Reif] So, where is the pain threshold then? 
  [Jagoda] In the Weimar Republic, we crossed it in 1932 to 
1933 at the very latest. The result was 1945. However, neither 
today nor at the time of the Weimar Republic could anyone say 
with certainty where the pain threshold lay and whether it has 
been reached. We can only establish that with hindsight. 
Whether we have 4, 5, 6, or ultimately 8 million unemployed is 
of no consequence in this respect. The situation is explosive 
every time. The point is that we have to be more resolute and 
active in creating new jobs. Continually bemoaning the situation 
leads nowhere. 
  [Reif] The number of people registered as unemployed has 
just risen to over 4 million.... 
  [Jagoda] Let me finish saying what I have to say. The pain 
of unemployment is a pain felt at the individual level. It will 
not be alleviated if more people become unemployed. For someone 
who wants to work, for himself and his family, unemployment is 
something exceptionally terrible. In that respect, the actual 
level of unemployment is irrelevant. It is and remains a 
personal tragedy. To reply to your question: This year, the 
number of people registered as unemployed in the old laender 
will rise by between 300,000 and 400,000. For 1993, the average 
annual level of unemployment was 2.3 million for the western 
part of the country, and with the increase that we are now 
expecting, it will rise to between 2.6 and 2.7 million. Since 
the middle of 1993, we have noted a trend toward stabilization 
in the new laender, and there are some indications that 
employment will increase. In January, however, the magical 
figure of 4 million was exceeded. It will fall back in the 
spring, but will remain high. At the end of the decade, over 3 
million people will still be unemployed in the Federal Republic. 
  [Reif] Does this mean that Volkswagen's four-day week is 
more than a desperate, but hopeless, struggle for work? 
  [Jagoda] Volkswagen's four-day week is not a model for the 
German economy as a whole, but is a temporary solution. It is, 
if you want to put it this way, an emergency solution for 
Volkswagen. 
  [Reif] Company programs aimed at boosting efficiency 
indicate that a further 500,000 jobs will be lost by the year 
2000.... 
  [Jagoda] I do not want to set figures. However, we will 
lose jobs in manufacturing. On the other hand, employment will 
grow in the construction and services sectors. Nevertheless, we 
should not throw in the towel, but ask ourselves: How can we 
create 500,000 new jobs by the year 2000? How are we going to 
compete internationally? What new processes and products should 
we develop? How can we promote and support patents? What 
incentives do we need to acquire a greater role in global 
economic and trade structures? It is simply nonsense to believe 
that we can become internationally more competitive through 
wages alone. 
  [Reif] Herbert Spaeth, president of the Handicrafts and 
Trades Association, has reminded his colleagues to display more 
responsibility with respect to jobs and training programs. 
  [Jagoda] My compliments to Mr. Spaeth. I have noticed that 
the training program situation in larger companies has 
deteriorated to reduce costs in the short term. I have observed 
with concern that the number of places on training programs has 
declined in the old laender above all.

<F P=106> [Report by "gw": "Half of the Price Increases Since </F>
Reunification Due to Rent Reform"] 
  [Text] Munich -- The increase in consumer prices, which 
has affected the new laender and East Berlin since coming into 
force of the economic and monetary union with West Germany in 
July 1990, has been strongly influenced by the cut in subsidies 
for consumer prices. According to a study by the Ifo Institute 
for Economic Research, rent reform accounts for 50 percent of 
the 30-percent increase in the cost of living in eastern Germany 
since reunification. 
  The increase in government-administrated prices contributed 
almost 24 percent to the consumer price increase between 1989 
and December 1993. Nonadministrated prices accounted for 6.5 
percent. Business researchers, however, say that directly 
administrated prices accounted for only 4.6 percent, while the 
group of partially administrated prices accounts for the lion's 
share of 20.8 percent. This mainly concerns the increase in 
rents (including ancillary costs), the costs for heating and hot 
water, and the increase in energy prices. 
  The group of quasi-administrated prices (beer, spirits, 
wine, 
tobacco, and coffee), on the other hand, became cheaper. In 
this sector, the December 1993 prices were 12.4 percent below 
the 1989 level -- also due to coffee and fuel prices going down. 
This resulted in the entire cost-of-living index decreasing by 
a mathematical 1.6 percent. 
  The beginning of 1993 saw a sharp increase in prices, 
especially due to the second regulation for basic rents, which 
caused housing costs to increase by 14.5 percent in the overall 
index. January 1993 also brought along price increases in 
public transport. Motor insurance was also 20.3 percent more 
expensive than at the beginning of 1992. The average annual 
price increase in the new laender was 8.8 percent. 
  According to Ifo, east German consumer prices will also be 
influenced by administrated price increases in 1994, although to 
a lesser extent. At the beginning of the year, housing costs 
went up once again and will thus account for a maximum 1.5 
percent of the 4.5-percent increase in the cost of living that 
Ifo predicts for the new laender in 1994 (western Germany in 
1994: plus 3 percent). As in the old laender, fuel tax and 
insurance premiums also went up in eastern Germany. In 
addition, public local transport fares and charges for municipal 
services are expected to increase above average. 
  In the Federal Government's opinion, government price 
controls for rents could be abolished in mid-1995, which would 
mean that a comparative rent system would be in effect, like the 
one in western Germany.

<F P=106> [Paul Cambon report: "Juppe and Leotard in Sarajevo Today"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard will be in Sarajevo today, according to a 
communique issued by the Foreign Ministry. Mr. Juppe left last 
night, initially flying to Zagreb. There he will notably meet 
with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. Juppe and Leotard will 
today visit Sarajevo where a meeting is planned with Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic. 
  This visit comes after Wednesday's [9 February] decision by 
NATO to give the Serbian forces 10 days to lift the siege of 
Sarajevo or be subjected to air strikes. The Foreign Ministry's 
communique added that Mr. Juppe will express the "firmness and 
determination" of Paris to "enforce the ultimatum issued by the 
Atlantic Alliance and which France had demanded. At the same 
time, France, in agreement with its allies, still subscribes to 
the need to do everything possible to restart the diplomatic 
process which must make it possible to find a political solution 
to the conflict." 
  The Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Juppe had discussed the 
visit with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd. All France's other 
European partners have also been kept informed. 
  Today's visit to Sarajevo by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
and 
Defense Minister Francois Leotard is a symbol of France's desire 
to persist in the determination expressed by NATO on Wednesday 
and to stress the unaltered priority: Beyond the warnings, the 
ultimatum, and possible sanctions by air strikes, the aim is 
still to push for negotiations between the three warring 
factions and therefore to create the conditions required to 
restore peace through diplomatic channels. 
  On this fundamental point, Paris and Washington have happily 
taken the same line. While pressure must continue to be put on 
the Serbs (and on the Croats) at the cost of real risks for the 
UN troops on the ground, France and America have finally reached 
an agreement on the issue of intensifying efforts of persuasion 
for the Bosnian Muslims. 
  In Sarajevo Alain Juppe will certainly work along these 
lines 
in his meeting with President Izetbegovic. Nonetheless, until 
the NATO ultimatum expires on 21 February, we can expect to see 
an escalation in the delaying tactics originating equally from 
Belgrade, Pale, and Moscow. There were already initial signs of 
this yesterday. Moreover, everyone still remembers the flurry of 
more or less successful diplomatic initiatives between December 
1990 and January 1991 that tried to avert war breaking out with 
Saddam Husayn. 
  This time, Paris at least considers that the it stands 
strong 
in the Bosnia dossier and that the determination of the West 
should not be caught out. While Alain Juppe firmly stresses 
that it is "Sarajevo first," he has still not forgotten the rest 
of Bosnia: central Bosnia, Tuzla airport, and the Srebenica 
enclave. 
  However, while Sarajevo takes priority, the Bosnian capital 
seriously risks being the exclusive focus of attention for 
observers. This means that, on the scattered front lines many 
threats and temptations will still remain open to all sides. 
The Muslims, for example, may well be tempted to profit from 
the new situation and provoke their enemies as they have done in 
the past. The Serbs could let themselves be caught up in an 
accelerating logic of reprisals. The same goes for the Croats. 
  Finally, there is the difficulty of checking the 
implementation of the NATO requirements on the ground, always 
assuming that no serious incidents occur between now and 21 
February to trigger NATO's intervention mechanism. Unless there 
is a dramatic turn of events, the West has therefore entered 
into a rigorous logic of dissuasion and determination. In any 
event, the chosen path is paved with many stumbling blocks and 
serious uncertainties.

<F P=106> [Jacques Jacquet-Francillon editorial: "Not So Simple"] </F>
  [Text] Everything is not quite as simple as it might have 
appeared the other night in Brussels when, after Greek, 
Canadian, and British reticence, among others, had been swept 
aside, the firm French initiative gained U.S. approval, and for 
a moment some people thought that merely an "ultimatum" imposed 
by NATO was required to "save Sarajevo," at the same time 
resolving the problem of squaring the Bosnian circle. 
Unfortunately, things are not so simple. 
  The response by the Bosnian Serbs was not short in coming: 
"Our artillery will not move one inch...." French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe undoubtedly has a ready reply on his lips, 
in the form of the alexandrine: "The cannon of the Gascons 
never retreat." However, NATO's fighter-bombers are no officers 
of Gascony [region in southwest France]. They obey regulations 
which are not as clear as one might have liked to think they 
were on Wednesday evening in the Belgian capital. 
  In order to launch an air strike once the ultimatum deadline 
has passed, in 10 days' time, or before, or even very soon if 
necessary, if the Serbs use their mortars once again, one order 
is needed from French UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander 
General Cot, and another order must come from the operational 
commander at NATO, U.S. Admiral Jeremy Boorda. However, both of 
these orders must be approved by UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  All of this is possible. All of this has been provided for. 
However, it remains the case that the UN secretary general only 
derives his authority from the Security Council, and that one UN 
resolution may quite evidently cancel out another. 
  The Russians lost no time. Just several hours after the 
Brussels "ultimatum," they -- quite legitimately, in the light 
of their permanent member status -- called an emergency meeting 
of the Security Council, with the clear objective of saying that 
they do not really see why NATO -- to which they do not belong 
-- should have become the executive body, the armed wing, of the 
United Nations. It is hardly likely that the Beijing government 
of China, another permanent member of the Security Council, 
which also has a right of veto, will oppose the arguments put 
forward by Moscow. 
  At the same time, the Bosnian Serbs have already found 
another answer. When Alain Juppe launched another appeal in 
favor of a political settlement, once more asking the United 
States to become more closely involved in French diplomatic 
efforts, Mr. Radovan Karadzic laid down a precondition for any 
continuation of negotiations in Geneva, namely that an 
international inquiry be held to establish who had really been 
responsible for the massacre that occurred at the central market 
in Sarajevo. This constituted a roundabout way of pointing a 
finger at the Bosnians. 
  Impudent though this may be, the tactic is not lacking in 
astuteness. While Bill Clinton has suddenly managed to find 
some virtue in the French position that he contested just a week 
ago, this is only because his public opinion would not have 
conceded that he remained indifferent to the unbearable images 
broadcast all day long on television in households across the 
United States. 
  Is nothing easier to do than turn around U.S. opinion?

  [Text] Marseille, France, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Fishermen 
started a dawn blockade of four ports in southern France Monday 
[14 February] as fishermen throughout France attacked lorries 
suspected of carrying cheap imports of foreign fish. 
  Around 15 fishing boats blocked access to the ports of 
Marseille, Fos sur Mer, Port Saint Louis du Rhone, and Port de 
Bouc at 0700 (0600 GMT). More boats were set to join the 
blockade during the day. 
  The fishermen, who have been on strike since Friday, have 
called for a meeting with the right wing president of the 
regional council, Jean-Claude Gaudin, to discuss their demands 
for guaranteed fish prices and an end to foreign imports. 
  The blockade was mounted without violence, and without much 
early effect on traffic, authorities said. 
  In a separate action early Monday, 100 Breton fishermen 
intercepted two refrigerated trucks on the Paris-Lille motorway, 
dumping several hundred kilograms of fish and goods they 
believed to be cheap imports, sources said. 
  The fishermen, who had traveled in 30 cars from their 
northwestern Finistere department, staged the two-hour protest 
action at the toll post at Chamant. 
  They urged passing motorists to go through without paying 
tolls. Police deployed nearby did not intervene and there were 
no incidents. 
  The fishermen initially sought to head for the huge Rungis 
wholesale market south of here -- where some 100 riot policemen 
have been deployed -- but then drove north. 
  Around 30 fishermen occupied a toll post at Saint Arnoult en 
Yvelines, south of Paris, for three hours after emptying the 
fish cargo of two Spanish lorries, separate sources said. The 
occupation, in which motorists were waved through the poll 
without paying, ended at 0700 (0600 GMT). 
  The fishermen were reinforced by a 50-strong coach party of 
fishermen who burned the salmon and cod cargo of two Spanish 
lorries after intercepting them at a service station on the A10 
motorway. All 80 fishermen headed for Brittany, sources added. 
  In Dreux west of Paris, police also intercepted a busload of 
50 fishermen carrying clubs, pickaxes and flares. 
  Thursday, French fishermen massively voted to continue a 
10-day strike, rejecting their union's call to return to work 
and an aid package negotiated by their leaders with the 
government on Tuesday. 
  The negotiations followed violence the previous week 
culminating in a daylong pitched battle in the Brittany capital 
of Rennes where a fishermen's delegation negotiated with Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur. Seventy-seven people were injured. 
  At France's request, the European Commission fixed minimum 
prices until March 15 for seven species of fish.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Philippe Seguin Warns Government"] </F>
  [Text] Philippe Seguin is sticking to his position. Eight 
months after his denunciation of a "Social Munich" and his call 
for a "cultural revolution" in order to combat unemployment, the 
president of the National Assembly yesterday issued a new 
warning to the government of Edouard Balladur. "The fight 
against unemployment must now carry the same weight as -- if not 
more weight than -- the defense of monetary parities in the 
fundamental budget choices," he stated at a colloquium on 
budgetary policy organized by the Government Audit Office. For 
Philippe Seguin the fight against unemployment is "the necessary 
precondition not only for economic growth but also for 
stabilizing the state budget." The fight against unemployment 
"must lie upstream of the budgetary procedure," because "a 
formidable recessionary spiral has set in whereby unemployment 
and social exclusion increase government expenditure while 
limiting income," the RPR [Rally for the Republic] deputy 
explained. He also made a series of proposals for better 
parliamentary control of public finances, suggesting in 
particular that the country's social budget should be submitted 
to the deputies and senators every year. He invited Pierre 
Joxe, the president of the Audit Office, to submit his report on 
the budget implementation to the National Assembly. 
  Budgetary policy, after having been ousted by liberal and 
monetarist ideology in the eighties, seems to be the subject of 
renewed interest, believes Jacques Spindler, professor of 
economics. But the margins for maneuver are limited. The 
growing interdependence of economies prevents -- or in any event 
severely limits -- any budgetary stimulation of the economy at 
national level. This is why the OFCE [French Economic 
Observatory] is calling for a policy of recovery at European 
level coupled with a sharp fall in interest rates. 
  The use of budgetary policy as an instrument of economic 
policy suffers from a number of limitations. Firstly, there is 
"great uncertainty on the economic diagnosis itself," stressed 
Jean-Luc Pain, assistant director at the budget office. The 
true situation is only known later, and the decisionmakers only 
have fragmented information on the exact causes of the 
recession. There is also the lack of budget flexibility. 
Budget margins have been reduced and most European countries 
are committed to policies designed to cut public expenditure. 
The erosion of the debt level due to growth rates above 
interest rates no longer works. "The snowball effect which 
affects the public debt has a supplanting effect even within the 
budget," stresses Gilbert Venet, assistant director at the 
economic forecast office. Interest payments on the debt (15 
percent of government expenditure) are thus made at the expense 
of other expenditure. 
  Michel Delebarre, a former minister, has also called for a 
review of the procedures for debating the budget in Parliament 
and a clarification of budget orientations. "Does allowing 
every minister to defend the funds of his ministry really help 
to achieve a coherent budget?" he wondered.

  [Text] Louis Gallois, the president of Aerospatiale, has 
asked for 3 billion French francs [Fr] from the company's major 
shareholder, the French Government, to provide the necessary 
financial support to the company while it prepares for 
privatization by the end of the century. The French Government 
has agreed to supply the company with Fr2 billion, and no one 
seriously expected more. Aerospatiale has had a difficult year 
with Airbus and military sales low. Its sales decreased 5 
percent in 1993. Despite this situation, its debt has been 
reduced. However, the group's balance sheet remains burdened by 
a colossal debt even though it has been reduced by 9 percent in 
1993: it is Frl5 billion, or twice shareholders' equity (Fr6 
billion). 
  "The state has done its duty as a shareholder," commented 
Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery commented. According to 
him, the EU Commission can not criticize the Fr2 billion. 
Aerospatiale, unlike [failing computer company] Bull, is not in 
difficulty and the austerity plan which has been enacted [at 
Aerospatiale] should allow a return to profitability in 1995. 
In the meantime, privatization is not the order of the day. 
Alphandery confirmed that the Fr2 billion will come from the 
Fr21-billion funds budgeted by the government for public 
companies.

<F P=106> [Article by Olivier Provost: "Aerospatiale Receives Fr2 </F>
Billion From State Instead of Fr3 Billion"] 
  [Text] Aerospatiale hoped to be recapitalized to the tune 
of 3 billion French francs [Fr] by the French Government, its 
majority shareholder (which holds 59.98 percent in conjunction 
with the 20 percent owned by Credit Lyonnais and the 20-percent 
share owned by state holding company Sogepa). The company will 
only receive Fr2 billion. The company's two supervising 
ministers, Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Economics 
Minister Edmond Alphandery, announced this on 2 February. They 
were backed by a lengthy official commentary: "This decision of 
the state shareholder will allow Aerospatiale to benefit fully 
from the progressive recovery of the markets especially in its 
new programs such as the Airbus A330 and A340. Like most 
aircraft manufacturers, it has been heavily affected by the 
situation of airline companies and the reduction of military 
sales. Aerospatiale knew how to adapt to this situation, 
launching an austerity program in 1992 which it then reinforced 
in 1993. Through this [funding] decision, the state shareholder 
gives proof of its confidence in a company of great potential, 
which has acquired in each of its product lines a leading global 
market position." 
  The allocation of these funds confirms LA TRIBUNE's report 
(see our edition on the 27 January 1994) of "an imminent but 
partial recapitalization of Aerospatiale." The Fr2 billion 
should increase shareholder equity to Fr8 billion on a little 
more than Fr13 billion debt, or a ratio of 1.6 compared to the 
somber ratio of three just a year ago. The company estimates 
that its debt/equity ratio will be "presentable" in the future 
and points out that it has "reduced its debt last year from Fr16 
billion to some Fr13 billion and that it has reduced its 
operating expenses 12 percent in the last two years." It notes 
that it is engaged in heavy and strategic programs for the 
future: the Aster missile, the Ariane 5 rocket, Tigre 
helicopters, the NH90, and, of course, the new Airbus and ATR 
aircraft. 
  The Economics Ministry -- the Defense Ministry argued for 
funds of Fr3 billion -- noted that the recapitalization of 
Aerospatiale, which is a "technological jewel, at the level of 
U.S. companies, and with a strong commercial success," was "a 
priority." The company, whose sales last year should turn out 
to be Fr49.3 billion (- 5 percent) "has multiplied its sales by 
five in 10 years. Aerospatiale -- political considerations 
aside -- will only have been recapitalized twice, in 1988, for 
around Fr2 billion, and today." 
  According to Bercy [Finance Ministry], the company, which 
had 
consolidated losses of Fr2.380 billion in 1992, "reported a very 
notable recovery of its profits before the funding. These 
funds, which will cover the 1994 reorganization plan, are 
important but net profits will in any event register a sharp 
increase. We are hoping that Aerospatiale will be able to break 
even rapidly." The prospect of privatization is thus no longer 
so far away. 
<H5>  Budget for Public Company Funding Dwindles </H5>
  The economics minister is a bit worried about the reactions 
from Brussels over the funding of Aerospatiale. On the other 
hand, the Fr21-billion budget for recapitalizing has dwindled 
right in front one's eyes. A little more than Fr7 billion is 
predicted for Bull (now being eyed by the EU Commission), at 
least Fr5 billion for Air France, Fr2 billion for EMC (Potasses 
d'Alsace), Fr500 million for CEPME; CGM, which is asking for 
Fr5O0 million should also be helped. But then what of Giat 
Industries, which wants Fr1 to Fr2 billion, which could be 
withdrawn -- the negotiations are still going on -- from the 
defense budget; of SNPE, which wants Fr400 million; and of 
SNECMA, which already received Fr750 million in 1993, which 
Bercy compares to Aerospatiale in terms of potential, and which 
wants yet another Fr 1 billion?

<F P=106> [Article by Gilles Senges: "Aerospatiale Recapitalized by </F>
Fr2 Billion"] 
  [Text] Aerospatiale, which has been expecting for some 
years a significant gesture from the French Government (which 
holds 80 percent of its capital in conjunction with Credit 
Lyonnais) from whom it was asking Fr3 billion, was just 
allocated Fr2 billion, to be taken from the global budget of 
Fr2l billion reserved for public companies in the 1993 and 1994 
budgets. 
  In a joint communique, Defense Minister Francois Leotard and 
Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery explained their decision 
citing their "confidence in a company with great potential which 
has acquired in each of its products lines a leading global 
position" and which, "as is the case with most aircraft 
manufacturers has been affected by the situation of airline 
companies and the reduction of military purchases." 
  The two ministers, noting the efforts the company has made 
to 
adapt since 1992, estimate that this sum, part of the 1993 
budget, "will allow Aerospatiale to benefit fully from the 
progressive recovery of its markets." The group, whose 
activities include defense (missiles), civilian aircraft, 
(Airbus, ATR, Eurocopter), and space (Ariane), seems satisfied 
with the allocated funds. "It is a breath of air which will 
guarantee existing programs and those to come," employees were 
saying acknowledging that in view of French economic 
difficulties, the effort by the government could not be more 
important. 
<H5>  Few Hopes for 1994 </H5>
  The company is currently considering new programs with its 
European partners including launching a military transport plane 
(FLA) derived from the Airbus (A330 and A340) and from ATR 
(ATR52 and ATR82); the development of a second generation of 
supersonic jet and a superjumbo jet; and the renewing of the 
classic and ballistic missiles line. At the partnership level, 
Aerospatiale, which has subsidiarized its helicopter business by 
merging with Deutsche Aerospace within Eurocopter, must now do 
the same, with the same partner, in its missiles and satellites 
business. 
  Prior to the state allocation the group, which lost 2.38 
billion French francs [Fr] in 1992 on sales of Fr52.3 billion, 
only had Fr6 billion in shareholders equity with a debt of Frl3 
billion. Yet its debt had been reduced Fr3 billion in two years 
thanks to reducing expenses (12 percent) such as reduced 
expenses for operating costs, for certain leasing operations, 
and selling stakes in some companies (Sextant, SEP). After 
having reported a loss of Fr870 million in the first half of 
1993, Aerospatiale is assured of having reduced its losses "in a 
substantial manner" for that year and has announced it expects 
to break even "at the latest in 1995." 
  SNECMA, which has already received Fr750 billion; and GIAT 
Industries, that is to say SNPE, should be the next to benefit 
from the money earned from privatizations this year and from 
some possible financial consequences of Defense Ministry 
negotiations over the next military program law, which leaves 
Aerospatiale little hope of receiving the remaining billion it 
wanted. 
  If a return to the private sector is not the order of the 
day 
for 1994 and 1995, Aerospatiale President-Director General Louis 
Gallois has suggested recently "a partial opening of capital" to 
minority shareholders, which could happen more rapidly since the 
state would keep 51 percent of the shares.

  [Text] Giorgio Napolitano, the speaker of the Chamber of 
Deputies, has had talks in New York with UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali about the situation in Bosnia following the NATO 
ultimatum. 
  Both men agreed that the NATO decision was a strong 
incentive 
to resume negotiations, thanks to the military and other 
pressure being applied to the Serbs. Nevertheless, Napolitano 
and Butrus-Ghali hoped that there would be no need for recourse 
to military intervention, and that the political will to find a 
solution to the conflict would prevail. 
  During his two-day visit to the United States, Napolitano 
has 
met congressmen and members of the Clinton administration as 
well as members of the Italian community and those from the 
world of economics and finance.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Occhetto and Berlusconi Are in Favor </F>
of Intervention"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The war in Bosnia is leading to strange 
rapprochements. In fact, as regards the possibility of military 
intervention in former Yugoslavia, [Democratic Party of the 
Left] Secretary Occhetto has found himself holding a similar 
position to that of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement], whereas Communist Renewal has 
declared itself against armed intervention. Occhetto said he 
was in no doubt that "we must intervene in Bosnia, and the 
international community must take up an active position. We 
cannot be helpless bystanders in witnessing such an atrocious 
war." MSI Deputy Cristiana Muscardini also stated where her 
party stood on this matter: "We have had enough words, enough of 
war! We Italians, and all Europeans, have the duty to commit 
ourselves resolutely so as to achieve a solution to the Bosnian 
conflict." For Berlusconi, on the other hand, peacemaking 
actions in Bosnia must be backed by military force, and Italy 
must support, within the European Community, the "line of 
determination," making available "its prestige and its military 
bases" to this end. The only voice against armed intervention 
was that of Communist Renewal member Ersilia Salvato, who stated 
that her party was definitely against the use of force in former 
Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Andrea Nativi commentary: "Too Easy To Deceive Alliance"] </F>
  [Text] The difficulty with which NATO has just been dealing 
with the latest crisis in Bosnia has highlighted yet again the 
weaknesses of the West, which has never managed to adopt a 
united stance and which above all has always submitted to the 
decisions of others and to the cunning of the Serbs. Even the 
threat of resorting to air raids if the Serbs do not withdraw 
their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo cannot be considered 
a move of fundamental strategic importance within the context of 
the Bosnian civil war. 
  Indeed, the international community has for months been 
issuing a series of palliative and half measures, consistently 
presented as decisive, always crowned by success. Consider 
"Deny Flight," the operation to impose a no-fly zone in the 
skies above Bosnia: It was preceded by a great publicity 
campaign and was perfectly executed by the NATO politicians, but 
no real results were achieved, partly because in the few 
instances when a violation of the flight ban was detected, they 
were not authorized to intervene. Similarly (and fortunately) 
there has been no response to the provocations of the Serbs -- 
from the antiaircraft batteries' radar which "floodlit" allied 
aircraft to Belgrade's fighters which "shadowed" NATO's 
reconnaissance aircraft as they tried to look beyond the 
borders. When the same kind of provocation was attempted by the 
Iraqis, the response was immediate and sharp. Of course, the 
situation in Bosnia is different, but.... 
  Be that as it may, since the Bosnian Serbs are able to crush 
their adversaries without recourse to Belgrade's aircraft, the 
NATO operation did not alter the outcome of the land battle in 
the slightest. 
  As for the watertight naval blockade, before it was 
implemented in earnest, innumerable "violators" succeeded in 
bringing through consignments of weapons and supplies for the 
fighters. For the past several months it has been more 
stringent, and the embargo has been implemented resolutely, but 
consignments continue to pass easily across the land borders 
with Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, which either are unable or 
unwilling to implement a total blockade. 
  Of course, the Croats and the Serbs in Bosnia receive all 
kinds of assistance from Zagreb and Belgrade, whereas supplies 
to the Muslims are insufficient, despite the Islamic community's 
efforts. 
  Even the "ultimatum" currently being discussed is of 
symbolic, rather than real, value: How can we forget that a 
similar sequence of events occurred some months ago when NATO 
aircraft were ready to intervene if the Serbs did not leave the 
strategic heights around Sarajevo? After an exhausting trial of 
strength, the Serbs did withdraw from Mount Igman and other high 
places. Everyone was happy, but after a few months we now find 
ourselves in the same situation again. It is just as well that 
Sarajevo was "saved." 
  So it is entirely in the Serbs' interests to agree to 
"submit" to the NATO-UN ultimatum: Indeed, it is better that 
they display their goodwill by announcing the withdrawal of 
their artillery even before the NATO bureaucratic monster sets 
itself in motion. It will take only a matter of hours, not 
days, to withdraw the guns and rocket launchers. Light weapons, 
such as mortars, can merely be hidden. If necessary, personnel 
and equipment can return to battle quickly. This, because NATO 
is only demanding that the guns be removed and that the 
bombardment of the city cease, not that the Serbs abandon their 
positions. And in order not to lose its role as "third agent" 
in the conflict, the United Nations cannot demand further 
concessions from the Serbs, notwithstanding Izetbegovic's 
continuing efforts to reverse at the negotiating table the 
defeats that he is suffering in the field. So the vise around 
Sarajevo will not be loosened, and there will be another 
stalemate. Even the proposed demilitarization of the city would 
not alter the overall strategic military picture. Be that as it 
may, even after media interest in the capital's tragic plight 
has ceased, the war would continue with the usual ferocity 
throughout the rest of the country. It does not take much to 
calm people's consciences, since nobody intends to become really 
involved in Bosnia. 
  In the form in which it has been formulated, the ultimatum 
does not serve much purpose and it discredits the international 
community even more: Principles of equity would have required 
the simultaneous imposition of identical conditions on the 
Croatian artillery units bombarding Mostar and on the Muslims 
occupying Tuzla, as well as on the Serbs who surround them. We 
can just imagine the paeans of triumph that the media will issue 
over the "liberation" of Sarajevo. Let us not delude ourselves; 
nothing has changed; the tragedy continues.

<F P=106> [Pietro Veronese report: "Europe Crosses the Rubicon"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday in Brussels an act of political will was 
performed. A moral Rubicon was crossed. A responsibility was 
accepted, finally. 
  The Atlantic Council involves not just Europe. The 
Alliance's three non-European members played a key role in the 
tormented Brussels discussions: the United States and Turkey 
for, Canada against. And undoubtedly because the principal 
product of the decision was a new European firmness. By France 
in particular. But also by Italy, the first to demand a 
"concrete reaction" to the [Sarajevo] market massacre. The 
others followed. The Russian threats, offered in Moscow, not 
only by nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and by a Duma at the 
mercy of every whim, but also by Boris Yeltsin in person, were 
ignored. The vicious circle of reasoning, which always imagined 
that military action would be followed by a worse reaction and 
which ended up taking no action at all, has been broken. 
Something has shifted: too late, perhaps, but for once, not 
too little. 
  Of course, a 12-hour meeting is not enough to change Europe. 
The idiosyncrasies, the tactics, and the hidden agendas remain. 
National interests are guiding governments. Greece is no less 
against any anti-Serb policy than before. Britain does not hope 
less than before that nothing will be done. Nonetheless, the 
NATO Council decided unanimously. And yesterday, whether out of 
conviction or out of opportunism, everyone voted yes. 
  What will happen now? The Brussels communique is not the 
last word. The final decision, the final go-ahead to order an 
attack by the Alliance's fighter bombers, lies with 
Butrus-Ghali. The "Bosnian operation" is in fact being carried 
out under the UN blue banner, not under the 12-starred one of 
the European Union, or under NATO's pink one. Yesterday's will 
only be a typed piece of paper placed in full view on the 
secretary general's desk on the 38th floor of UN Headquarters, 
alongside the reports of the blue helmets' field commanders and 
of "special envoy" Yasushi Akashi. After 10 days, they will 
report whether the Serbs have effectively withdrawn their heavy 
artillery surrounding Sarajevo, and whether the UN contingent 
will or will not be overly exposed to any reprisals. The 
inscrutable Butrus will get up from his desk, look out of his 
window over the East River running at his feet, will weigh up 
the pros and cons -- possibly more concerned with his own 
political fortune than the fate of peace and war -- and will 
pronounce his decision. 
  For this reason it is possible that yesterday's decision 
will 
remain a dead letter. Maybe, at the moment of decision in the 
Atlantic Council's meeting chamber, more than one representative 
calculated this way. To know how things will end up, one can 
only wait and see. But whatever happens, yesterday's date marks 
a point of no return. It will now be difficult for Sarajevo's 
martyrdom to be relegated to the darkness of indifference, 
cynicism, and abject inaction. One does not lose one's 
credibility twice. 
  The 16 ambassadors who laboriously concluded the Atlantic 
Council's communique, while acting under instructions from their 
governments, had good reason to rejoice yesterday evening. Many 
hours before the conclusion of the session, Serbian and Bosnian 
military chiefs in Sarajevo had granted UN General Michael Rose 
and the Bosnian army a cease-fire and intimated their readiness 
to withdraw their heavy artillery. It is not the first time 
such a pledge has been made, and there is no reason to believe 
it will be kept this time any more than other times. But it is 
a sign that firmness pays, and that the West's determination is 
worrying Sarajevo's besiegers. In the words of French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe: "If the Serbs withdraw, I would like to 
twist their arm a little more."

<F P=106> [Report by Silvio Buzzanca: "The New Right Musters Almost </F>
50 Percent"] 
  [Text] The CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] weekly 
survey conducted for Telemontecarlo [TMC] gives Forza Italia 24 
percent of the vote, the left coalition 34 percent, and [Pact 
for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PPI, 
Secretary] Martinazzoli 17 percent. The League drops to 10 
percent, on a par with National Alliance. 
  Forza Italia thus gains percentage points, the left holds 
on, 
the center drops behind. Rete [Network] and the Greens move up 
together with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi; National 
Alliance, Democratic Alliance [AD] (with the secularists), and 
Communist Renewal hold their positions; the PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left] and the League move slightly back; 
Martinazzoli's PPI and Segni's Pact for Italy lose ground, as do 
[Christian Democratic Center, CCD, leaders] Casini and 
Mastella's centrists. These are the results of the CIRM weekly 
survey of Italians' electoral preferences, as broadcast by TMC 
yesterday evening. 
  These results, however, must be treated very cautiously, 
because they are based on a proportional share of the vote, 
whereas 75 percent of the seats must actually be won in each 
individual constituency, following a direct contest between 
candidates, in which "local" factors not taken into account in 
surveys also come into play. Furthermore, the results must take 
into account the fact that 71 percent of the 2,500 interviewees 
said they had made up their minds, whereas 29 percent have not 
yet decided for whom to vote. The undecided, however, 
constitute a shrinking percentage -- last week they made up 33 
percent -- and largely belong to certain sociodemographic 
categories: women, particularly housewives, people over 55, 
people with no formal education. 
  Among the undecided, a particularly important group are 
those 
who profess to support the "center." CIRM emphasized this fact, 
adding that, whereas in previous elections undeciveness was 
spread across the parties, this time it involved mainly the 
"center." Researchers warned, however, that this does not 
necessarily mean such people will eventually vote for 
Martinazzoli and Segni's candidates. The "center" interviewees 
range from Berlusconi to the progressives' right wing and those 
PDS candidates who are considered to be more "moderate." In 
addition, in order to interpret these percentages, it is 
necessary to establish who will ultimately win the vote of those 
who identify with certain political forces -- for example, 
republicans and socialists -- that are profoundly divided in 
terms of the alliances. There are [Italian Socialist Party 
Secretary] Del Turco's socialists, who are aligned with the 
progressives with [Enzo] Mattina's socialists; there are Piro 
and Boniver's socialists [Federation of Italian Socialists], who 
want to reach an agreement with Martinazzoli; and there are 
those, such as Signorile, who have already reached an agreement 
with the center. The same applies to the republicans: Some are 
siding with AD and the progressives; [Italian Republican Party, 
PRI, Secretary] La Malfa occupies the center with the PPI; and 
Castagnetti and Gorgoni are siding with Segni. 
  [Radical Party leader] Pannella, on the other hand, 
constitutes a typical case. He has chosen a center position, 
whereas those who say they want to vote for him identify with 
the progressives. What will these voters do in the 
constituencies when they will be forced to choose between a 
"progressive" candidate and some other candidate? 
  In this flurry of men and acronyms, of pacts and alliances 
which are born and die within a few hours, the only possible 
reading of the results is one in terms of major groupings: 
left, center, and center-right. Within this framework, the 
center-right alignment headed by Berlusconi, [National Alliance 
leader] Fini, [League Secretary] Bossi, and Casini is predicted 
to win 49 percent of the vote, compared with 45 percent seven 
days ago. This figure is obtained by adding Forza Italia's 24 
percent, National Alliance's 10 percent, another 10 percent 
corresponding to the League, and the 4 percent mustered by CCD, 
which has lost one percentage point. 
  The CIRM opinion poll shows a Knight [Berlusconi nickname] 
sailing full steam ahead, moving from 19 percent to 24 percent 
of the vote in a single week -- a result which must have been 
influenced by the electoral show at the EUR [Rome suburb], and 
the wide coverage given to the "convention" by certain TV 
networks. Fini obtained the same results as the previous week, 
whereas Bossi lost one percentage point. This confirms the 
downtrend in the Bandwagon's [League nickname] share: On 21 
January CIRM gave it 13 percent of the vote, on 28 January 12 
percent, and on 4 February 11 percent -- and yet the League's 
congress took place only one week ago, offering ample 
opportunity for TV and press coverage. 
  The PPI and Forza Italia's "center," still struggling with 
the problem of certain "thorny" candidacies, lost another three 
percentage points, dropping from 20 percent to 17 percent. This 
confirms that Berlusconi entering the field penalized 
Martinazzoli and Segni, who mustered 23 percent of the vote only 
one week ago. The same applies to National Alliance which, had 
the Knight remained in place at the head of his business empire, 
could have aspired to 15 percent of the vote. 
  What about the left? Despite Berlusconi's forceful entry on 
stage, the progressives' alliance, though badly shaken by fierce 
disputes over the candidacies and by AD's threats to 
"disengage," can still count on the same share as last week: 34 
percent of the vote. Does this signal a reversal of the trend 
of the previous two weeks, during which the "glorious war 
machine" seemed to be misfiring? On 28 January support was down 
to 36 percent of the vote, whereas on 21 January it was 39 
percent. The Oak [PDS nickname] lost one percentage point, 
dropping from 20 percent to 19 percent, whereas Rete and the 
Greens, who are grouped together by CIRM researchers, gained one 
percentage point, up from 4 percent to 5 percent. This is the 
same figure given for Communist Renewal and AD, which remain 
stationary.

<F P=106> [Report signed "f.gui.": "Martinazzoli and Segni Argue Over </F>
Symbols and Those Under Investigation"] 
  [Text] Rome -- It is a pity not to be able to witness the 
negotiations between the two (former) Christian Democrats. 
[Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PPI, 
Secretary] Martinazzoli are being forced into a trial of 
strength that each must win, though they both pretend it will 
end in a draw. They are still in dispute over at least two 
issues -- candidates and symbols. Segni does not want anyone 
under investigation on the joint lists. Martinazzoli still has 
to decide what to do about Mattarella, on the assumption that De 
Mita will have the sense to withdraw on his own. As for 
[Interior Minister] Mancino, also under investigation, the 
attitude is that it is better not to attempt too many things at 
once, and that whoever prevails will decide what to do. 
  It seems that the business of the suspect candidates has 
given rise to some grotesque episodes. "I will exclude 
so-and-so, even though he is not in trouble with the law, so 
that you too can be free of anyone who might be tainted." This 
is more or less the suggestion Segni is making to Martinazzoli. 
But the latter's response is to say that he is willing to forego 
standing for reelection himself, precisely in order to make a 
gesture of renewal. If Martinazzoli does stay home, however, 
Segni must do so too, after being on the political scene for the 
past five legislative terms. And so this entertaining dance of 
the Christian Democrats is marked by a succession of proposals 
made and denied. 
  The disagreement is not confined to names, whether presumed 
or inferred. Segni is also demanding a single symbol -- his, of 
course -- for candidates for the proportional quota. In other 
words, it is clear that the promoter of the referendum wants to 
secure leadership of the group both de facto and de jure. As 
usual among Christian Democrats, there had to be a mediation 
proposal. This is being attempted by the philosopher, Rocco 
Buttiglione, who has one foot in the Pact for Italy and the 
other in the Popular Party. 
  His idea is this: that the popularists yield over the issue 
of those under investigation, and that the Pact permits 
Martinazzoli to use his own symbol in the electoral contest. It 
is only a compromise in a manner of speaking. In fact 
Buttiglione would succeed at a stroke in achieving De Mita's 
exclusion and at the same time not humiliating Martinazzoli. On 
the other hand, the issue of those being investigated is a 
matter of principle. Segni absolutely refuses to have them on 
the lists. The popularists, however, are urging that an 
exception be made for the crime of public funding of the 
parties. If money was appropriated for corrupt purposes, they 
say, then the veto remains valid. But when it was taken in 
violation of a parliamentary law governing public funding of the 
parties, then it is a different matter. 
  Be that as it may, it is clear that the PPI is angry about 
their beloved Segni's stubbornness. Segni apparently went as 
far as to threaten resignation for the sake of "salvaging" the 
principle of excluding those under investigation. But at this 
stage it is difficult to distinguish between rumors, 
interpretations, and attempts to raise the stakes in the 
negotiations. A succession of very confidential separate 
meetings were held by Segni at his offices and by Martinazzoli's 
popularists at Piazza del Gesu [PPI headquarters]. Late 
yesterday evening the Popular Party's Vito Riggio acted as 
ambassador between Segni and Martinazzoli. There were 
diplomatic missions and external statements in an attempt to 
influence the talks. 
  "A solution of the problem of candidates to be listed 
depends 
on common sense, humility, and realism," Rosy Bindi suggested, 
changing her role as "pasionaria" for that of the good and 
conscientious older sister. However, she still addressed the 
following sharp remark to Segni: "I would simply point out that 
the troops will be needed nevertheless." Basically, for once 
Bindi perfectly reflects the feelings of a party newly "reborn" 
that feels humiliated by Segni's diktats. 
  Gerardo Bianco, the PPI's lower house floor leader, referred 
to this "pure obsession with the new." Martinazzoli was very 
resolute: "It no longer accepts this cursing of the old. This 
is a Popular Party which is contesting the elections for the 
first time. We are seeking alliances. It seems to me that what 
we are creating is politically significant. However, if the 
conditions are unacceptable, the minimum rules for a contract 
would be lacking." 
  Martinazzoli warned his friend, Segni: "Nobody is sending me 
any messages." The PRI's [Italian Republican Party] La Malfa 
commented, somewhat enviously: "If [Democratic Party of the 
Left Secretary] Occhetto had received a notice of investigation, 
he would still stand as a candidate."

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Italian Northern League </F>
lower house floor leader, by "r.u."; place and date not given: 
"Maroni: `Berlusconi and Italian Social Movement? A Minor 
Agreement...'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Mr. Maroni, did you know 
that there are now rumors of a secret meeting between [League 
Secretary] Bossi, [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, and 
[National Alliance leader] Fini? 
  [Maroni] That is quite ridiculous. You will never see any 
such meeting; we will never sit down at the same table as Fini. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But Berlusconi, your great ally, has just 
signed an agreement with the Italian Social Movement [MSI]. 
  [Maroni] It is not a political agreement nor an agreement on 
policy. It is merely an agreement to defeat the left in central 
and southern Italy. As far as we are concerned, they are still 
fascists; we will sweep them away. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But this "triangle" has every appearance of 
a 
political calculation: If Bossi allies with Berlusconi and 
Berlusconi allies with Fini, Bossi is allying with Fini. 
  [Maroni] That would threaten to split Italy, with the north 
going to the League and the south to the National Alliance, with 
Berlusconi acting as a link. In any case, how could we ally 
with a party that is waging war on us? 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What are you referring to? 
  [Maroni] Fini will field his own candidates in all the 
constituencies of the north, which means against the League. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] The MSI's strength in those areas does not 
appear to be unstoppable. 
  [Maroni] They will field Servello in Milan, and in any case, 
even if they were to field Almirante--brought back to 
life--those lists are stacked against us, irrespective of the 
names on them. But in this election we will have great pleasure 
in proclaiming the death of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] 
and the MSI. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] The end of [Italian Popular Party Secretary] 
Martinazzoli's party? 
  [Maroni] Of course. They will not win a single seat in the 
north, at most two or three seats in the Senate as a result of 
the fragmentation of the vote. From the proportional quota, 
they will not gain the minimum 4 percent. Martinazzoli's idea 
is suicidal. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Will you too not pay a high price for the 
MSI's "support." 
  [Maroni] I repeat: We have nothing to share with them. Fini 
and his men will not be part of the single liberal-democratic 
parliamentary group. There will be deputies elected from the 
League, those of Forza Italia, and also those of the CCD 
[Democratic Christian Center] and the UDS [Union of Democratic 
Socialists]. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But Fini and Berlusconi will be standing 
together in central and southern Italy. 
  [Maroni] The National Alliance deputies will form a group on 
their own, while those of Forza Italia will join our 
parliamentary group. Berlusconi has a agreement covering policy 
and government with us, and with Fini only an electoral 
understanding. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Do Berlusconi and, above all, Fini see it 
this way? 
  [Maroni) Fini himself has said so, stressing that it is not 
an alliance on policy with Forza Italia. So everything is 
clear. We want to govern. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] With whose votes? 
  [Maroni] In the 360 constituencies of the north we will win 
a 
minimum of 250 seats and a maximum of 300. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] How will you share candidates with 
Berlusconi? 
  [Maroni] On the basis of specific responsibilities with 
regard to work in parliament. To be specific, there are 360 
constituencies and 13 parliamentary committees; dividing one by 
the other, we will identify 27 individuals appropriate to each 
committee. What will happen in the case of the Justice 
Committee, for instance? Well, we will choose as our candidates 
27 lawyers or attorneys.

  [Text] Let us begin with Paolo Berlusconi's arrest. Dario 
Carrella reports from Milan: 
  [Carrella] There was another sensational development this 
morning in the clean hands offensive. Another qualitative leap 
forward was made. 
  Paolo Berlusconi was arrested on the order of the Milan 
public prosecutor's office, which had made him the subject of a 
warrant for preventive detention. Examining Judge Italo Ghitti 
and Prosecuting Judge Antonio Di Pietro will question him this 
afternoon. 
  The arrest warrant is within the framework of investigations 
into kickbacks paid to encourage the Cariplo [Cassa Risparmio 
delle Provincie Lombarde] pensions fund to purchase several 
buildings. Berlusconi has been accused by one of those under 
investigation-- broker Giuseppe Clerici, who was formerly a 
Cariplo employee--of paying a bribe of more than 1 billion lire. 
News about Berlusconi's involvement in this chapter of the 
clean hands investigation has been making the rounds for several 
days. 
  The clean hands judges have also ordered two other arrests, 
but this time related to illegal financing of political parties. 
Giovanni Donigaglia, chairman of the Argenta building 
cooperative has been arrested. The Milan judiciary had already 
investigated Donigaglia within the framework of possible illegal 
contributions to the Italian Communist Party. This time 
Donigaglia is accused of having illegally paid 350 million lire 
to former Christian Democratic Party treasurer Severino 
Citaristi during the 1992 general election campaign. 
  Antonio Mosconi, former managing director of Toro 
Assicurazioni, part of the Fiat Group, has also been arrested. 
He is accused of having illegally given 200 million lire to 
Cesare De Piccoli, the former communist deputy mayor of Venice. 
The Milan public prosecutor's office has sent a cautionary 
warrant to De Piccoli, who is currently a PDS [Democratic Party 
of the Left] member of the European Parliament.

<F P=106> [Report by Vito Biello: "The Economics of the Second </F>
Republic"] 
  [Text] A platform, be it progressive or leftist, already 
exists in a certain sense and will be made known very soon. A 
moderate or rightist one has yet to be created. It does not 
matter whether it is square, round or rectangular, for now 
political groups are watching this "program platform" which 
should show the way for the government program in the next 
legislature. 
  The progressive forces that gravitate around the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] seem to be going full speed 
ahead, strengthened by the successes in the recent 
administrative elections. Favored in the polls, propelled by 
unprecedented international acceptance, the Alliance is now 
facing its ordeal by fire, precisely that of its platform. "The 
government's program is going to come out of this," Occhetto is 
fond of repeating, "and it will decide who is in and who is 
out." The compatibility of the forces ranging from the Greens to 
Refoundation is up for discussion. 
  The economists of the oak tree [PDS symbol] insist that 
there 
is no turning back for the policy of reform. Occhetto professes 
moderation, D'Alema is the first to hint at a return of Ciampi, 
and insists on a "government of transition," but for the 
progressive forces, the proof of the pudding is around the 
corner. Among the moderate forces on the other hand, everything 
is up in the air. The political groups are thinking more about 
agreements and alliances than about programs. 
  The DC [Christian Democratic Party] is preparing to become 
the Italian Popular Party, and the confusion is great; the other 
political groups regard one another at times with suspicion, or 
alternately offer the hand of friendship. Bossi and Segni, 
Berlusconi's (eventual) political party and the Popular Party 
exchange messages while waiting to make a decision. But on this 
front as well, the coming weeks will be decisive. 
  Therefore, it is time for some answers, beginning with those 
to the 10 questions posed by the Confindustria [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry]. 
  MONDO ECONOMICO listened to the views of Michele Salvati, 
leading economist of the PDS and author of its economic program; 
Maria Segni, leader of the Popularists; and Roberto Maroni, head 
of the group of League deputies in the Chamber.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michele Salvati, Democratic Party of </F>
the Left, PDS, economist, by Vito Biello; place and date not 
given: "Rigor Is Sprouting Under the Oak Tree"] 
  [Text] [Biello] Professor Salvati, what are the two or 
three essential points of the government economic program of the 
progressive area? 
  [Salvati] The first really essential point is the selection 
of the persons to head the government, and the principal 
ministers. Beyond all the statements of principle, it is much 
more important to the potential voter to have an idea of the 
team that will make the decisions. It makes a big difference, 
and the message is immediate, to entrust reform of the 
bureaucracy to Cassese instead of Gasperi, for example. 
  [Biello] Therefore, you believe it is useful to announce the 
names of the prime minister and the team along with the program? 
  [Salvati] In a sense, the names of the principal ministers 
are even more important than that of the prime minister. 
Precisely because the things that need to be done for this 
country involve primarily modernization and civility, and not 
questions of right or left, the persons selected are decisive. 
Everyone will say in their programs that the fundamental issue 
is state administration, reform of government finances; everyone 
will repeat a series of obvious key points. 
  [Biello] What distinguishes the progressive program from 
that 
of the moderates? 
  [Salvati] If I had to give a very general picture, I would 
say that, compared with the center-right, the moderate left 
should be more attentive to industrial growth and employment 
than to financial rigor. 
  [Biello] Rigor and resources. How will a progressive 
government operate? 
  [Salvati] The truth is that many of the measures that must 
be 
taken and on which a government of left-center should commit 
itself have little to do with the macroeconomic side, for which 
the road is rather obligatory. There can be some differences: 
for example, I believe that a government of the left would be 
less disposed to be the best pupil in the class in Europe, on 
monetary and financial matters, and instead would defend more 
strongly the interests of industry and workers in its own 
country. However, the important differences are to be found at 
the structural level, in the tax structure, government spending, 
reform of government administration. Let us be clear about 
rigor. The problem is the an eventual left-center policy runs 
the risk of being too rigorous. Let me explain with an example: 
did not a large part of all those votes for Fini in Rome come 
from government employees angry with Cassese? Is that not rigor? 
In effect, the policy of left-center recognizes on the one hand 
that not much can be done at the macroeconomic level, on the 
other hand it insists on measures of rationalization and 
structural reform that could be unpopular. 
  [Biello] You are saying that only a government of the left 
can carry out a policy of the right? 
  [Salvati] It is not a question of right or left. For 
example, 
if strong elements of equity and responsibility are introduced 
into the government administration, a work of justice is 
accomplished. This is almost a revolutionary decision for the 
left. The Cassese plan is justice and only justice: it completes 
equalization of working conditions in the public and the private 
sectors. So that today a bit of justice goes arm in arm with 
efficiency. 
  [Biello] And besides government administration? 
  [Salvati] There are situations that separate the two sides. 
Situations of real social hardships, such as dismissals, for 
example, about which the left cannot close its eyes and think 
that they need not be assisted. There are also certain requests, 
such as flexibility in lay offs, which certainly must be faced, 
but in a detailed way. A different matter is the attack on 
injustice, wherever it may be, at the fiscal level, the 
bureaucracy, or high incomes. Today we have a profoundly unequal 
distribution of income and the picture of industrial efficiency 
is desolate. Therefore, supervisory institutions such as the 
"Antitrust" or the Consob [Commission for the Supervision of 
Companies and Stock Exchanges] must be greatly strengthened. If 
there is to be rigor, it must be for everyone. 
  [Biello] Do you favor greater flexibility in the labor 
market? 
  [Salvati] I do not question certain measures of flexibility. 
For example, I would be in favor of encouraging "part-time" 
work, which is substantially ignored in Italy. It would be 
necessary to discuss others in detail, one by one. 
  [Biello] What do you think of the Confindustria decalogue? 
  [Salvati] I think it was an intelligent and timely political 
move. Seven or eight of those requests show good sense. The 
political significance however is: we will abstain from the 
immediate political struggle and evaluate the facts. It is a 
responsible and democratic position. 
  [Biello] But what would you respond to the specific points? 
  [Salvati] It would be necessary to go into it in detail. But 
for the most part, we would agree. 
  [Biello] What are the names of the government team? 
  [Salvati] For certain ministries I would not go further than 
those in the preceding government, partly to avoid problems. For 
others, it would not be difficult to find names. The problem is 
a different one, it is the creation of a new leadership class. 
  [Biello] And Ciampi? 
  [Salvati] He has been useful in this transitional phase. 
This 
has been an important government. What happened during this 
period was amazing: the government, passing the budget bill, and 
kept on its feet by the Lega and the PDS. 
  [Biello] But could this responsibility shown by the PDS have 
been only tactical? 
  [Salvati] If being tactical means being responsible, fine. I 
understand the perplexity of certain observers. However, I do 
not share certain very skeptical statements by a person I 
esteem, such as Andreotti. Some of his comments went too far: it 
is true that, following the logic of the past, the PDS played 
the game like all the others. But we are in a very different 
situation now: watch what the PDS does and judge it on that 
basis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mario Segni, leader of the "Pactists," </F>
by Vito Biello; place and date not given: "Neither With Reagan, 
Nor With the Man in the Street"] 
  [Text] The "Pactists:" Segni speaks. His ideal is not the 
Iron Lady, Mrs. Thatcher, neither is it former U.S. President 
Ronald Reagan. On the contrary, he is convinced that efficiency 
and solidarity are not antithetical. Mario Segni is not giving 
up, because he sees plenty of room for a political force in 
opposition to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. 
  [Biello] Well Deputy Segni, the progressive front has found 
its identity. Where are the "Pactists" looking? 
  [Segni] The current objective is to create a 
liberal-democratic and reformist group, an alternative to the 
leftist group of the PDS. Therefore, I launched the Pact for 
National Rebirth, asking citizens for a million signatures. I 
explained the key points of my program clearly: those who agree 
with them can join the pact. I will never agree to place 
national unity in discussion, just as I have already said that 
the MSI [Italian Social Movement] or National Alliance is not an 
alternative to the PDS. 
  [Biello] Let us go to the economic program. What will you do 
about the budget? 
  [Segni] Spending must be reduced, but this does not mean 
destroying the social state. For many years it was said that 
efficiency and solidarity are irreconcilable; well, I want to 
build a state that is able to guarantee both requirements. For 
example, the South still needs assistance, but productive 
assistance, not welfare. 
  [Biello] Quite a challenge. Unless you are thinking about 
raising taxes. 
  [Segni] The tax burden absolutely cannot be increased, and I 
have proposed setting a 40 percent ceiling on rates. The 
obstacles that make the tax system a hindrance to development 
must be removed. And decentralization is needed that will give 
local administrations the means to govern. 
  [Biello] And the labor emergency? 
  [Segni] We must provide greater flexibility to the labor 
market, especially to facilitate entry into it, aside from 
eventual temporary departures. And we must invest in human 
capital.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni by MONDO ECONOMICO </F>
correspondent; place and date not given: "A Kinder Tax System 
for Those Who Invest"] 
  [Text] Maroni speaks. No to uncontrolled laissez-faire. Yes 
to a market economy that protects the weak, with a public 
presence limited to guaranteeing the rules. A less onerous tax 
system which burdens companies less. A fight against waste to 
reduce government spending. The Lega is prepared to accept 
alliances on its economic and political programs. Will it be 
Mario Segni? Will it be Berlusconi? "The turning point of the 
Congress was opening the door. We are ready to talk: it is not a 
take it or leave it document. But careful: time is short. A 
decision must be made by 15 January." Roberto Maroni is 
speaking, Umberto Bossi's right arm. 
  "Waste must be eliminated, the extraordinary assistance to 
the South, refinanced for 5 trillion lire. Social welfare must 
be limited, the system of assistance to firms reexamined. 
Government administration must be reformed. Not only by firing 
the loafers, as Segni says. The structure must be reexamined in 
order to improve services and cut costs." 
  [MONDO ECONOMICO] What should be the role of the state in 
the 
economy? 
  [Maroni] The public role must be eliminated. The state must 
guarantee respect for the rules. But it should be the market 
that makes the rules. That way, a real social state can be born, 
free of welfare abuse. The demise of the public presence must 
come about by privatization and a rewriting of the rules. But 
careful! Privatization must be real, actual publicly held stock 
companies must be created in Italy. I would not want to find the 
parties once again as owners, impersonated by Mediobanca 
[Financial Credit Bank], by the great families, by the friends 
of the friends. As for the rules, they must not be written only 
in the halls of Parliament, but with the collaboration of the 
interested persons. The hot subjects are: credit, Antitrust, the 
Mammi law and privatization. 
  [MONDO ECONOMICO] Firms are asking for a less onerous tax 
system. Are they right? 
  [Maroni] The tax system must be reformed, to make it more 
equitable and simpler. For firms, we are thinking not only of 
not taxing profits that are reinvested, but even about 
additional fiscal incentives for investors. And it must be done 
so that private savings are directed toward investing in 
companies. We have in mind the modernization of the stock 
exchange and the creation of local stock markets, more 
accessible to small companies. Perhaps that way the banks will 
stop behaving like usurers and be more ready to run a risk.

concluded a one-hour news conference. We are going over to the 
Moncloa for a full report from Jose Luis Garcia del Pozo. 
  [Garcia del Pozo] [passage omitted] In conclusion, the prime 
minister spoke of Bosnia and of the situation of our troops 
engaged in humanitarian tasks there on the United Nation's 
behalf. He said that everything possible is being done to 
protect the men and that there will, of course, be no unilateral 
withdrawal. He said that, and I quote, we are not going to make 
a unilateral decision to withdraw our troops. We will talk to 
our partners because the effect of such a decision on our 
country's international credibility would be very negative. 
This would be linked to the fact that our country has already 
spent a long time (?enshrined)--as Gonzalez put it--in isolation 
from the international community.

<F P=106> [Xavier Ventura report: "Arzalluz Asserts That Government's </F>
Autonomy Policy Is Schizophrenic and Farcical"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) 
Chairman Xabier Arzalluz yesterday accused the central 
government of practicing "schizophrenia and a farce" by tending 
increasingly toward the creation of a unitary state, although 
saying that this is not so. Arzalluz made these statements in 
Barcelona at the conclusion of the meeting of the PNV and 
Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) Executive Committees, at 
which the two Christian Democratic parties decided to demand of 
the government that it drop its centralist criteria in European 
building and allow the presence of representatives of the 
Catalan and Basque governments in Community institutions. 
  Arzalluz showed himself "optimistic," albeit with 
reservations, when referring to the negotiation with the 
Socialists on the pending transfers [of areas of responsibility] 
to the Basque Country, and so asked Felipe Gonzalez to continue 
contacts in order to find a "political solution." The Basque 
leader said that the PNV's observance of the Constitution 
depends on the implementation of the autonomy statute, and so, 
if this process is not carried out, a "very grave" situation 
will be reached. Arzalluz also pointed out that the agreement 
on the statute had as its background observance of the 
constitutional system by the PNV, since the party did not 
approve the Constitution. In view of this he warned that "we 
cannot allow implementation of the statute not being completed" 
in the current legislative term, the government's "refusing to 
implement it," or, if it does so, subsequently "undermining" it 
through laws, decrees, or Constitutional Court rulings. 
  The meeting between Union and the PNV -- the first of the 
meetings which will henceforth be held every six months -- was 
basically aimed at establishing a joint stance on the presence 
of Catalonia and the Basque Country in the European Union. In 
this connection the two parties believe that the Spanish state 
is the "most centralist" in its European role and demand that 
the autonomous governments' presence in Community institutions 
be ensured, and also that the autonomous communities be able to 
take part in the state's political stance on European issues, as 
is the case in Belgium and Germany, for instance. 
  To achieve this, Union leader Josep Antoni Duran Lleida 
explained, the electoral law for the European elections must be 
amended, replacing the single constituency covering the whole of 
Spain with regional constituencies. They also demand the 
involvement of the Catalan and Basque governments in the 
allocation of Community funds, and the political normalization 
of the missions which both autonomous communities have abroad. 
Arzalluz asserted that the European integration process is 
being carried out with "centralist criteria" and that it is 
being used to enable the central government to "take back 
power," since "a standardization process is being attempted in 
Spain in the name of European unity." 
  In addition, the two parties reiterated their intention to 
put forward a joint program in the European elections since 
their European deputies are in the same group in the European 
parliament. UDC and the PNV did not raise at this meeting the 
possibility of running together in the European elections, as 
the Basque party proposed in 1989 -- a request opposed by 
Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC). Arzalluz said that 
"we are already running together, albeit not on the same list," 
although he asserted that the Basques "are not coming to 
separate anything in Catalonia," while Duran asserted that Union 
"gives priority to the coalition with CDC" and rules out running 
with the PNV, even though he still believes that "we would like 
to run together."

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has stressed that, for 
the salvation of Cyprus, he is pursuing what he considers to be 
the proper policy, on the basis of his own judgment and 
considering all positions, and that he does not judge what he 
must do according to the views expressed by each political 
leader. Mr. Kliridhis said this to correspondents this morning 
when commenting on the opposition of the Democratic Party and 
the socialist party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] to 
the confidence-building measures. Asked to comment on the 
statement by EDEK Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis that any measures 
that are not direct would be disastrous, President Kliridhis 
said this is just the view of Mr. Lissaridhis. 
  President Kliridhis made these remarks today while visiting 
the Maronite community on the occasion of the holiday for St. 
John Maronas, the patron saint of the Maronites. In an address 
at a gathering of the Maronites, President Kliridhis said any 
Cyprus solution that does not provide for the freedoms of 
return, movement, and settlement would not be acceptable either 
to him personally or to anyone who struggles for the true 
freedom of the island.

  [Excerpt] President Rauf Denktas has declared that it is 
the content, and not the number of items on the agenda, for the 
indirect talks scheduled to begin on 17 February that is 
important. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
assistant special envoy for Cyprus, who is holding preparatory 
talks for the implementation of the confidence-building 
measures, met at 1645 today for his second meeting with Denktas. 
  In a statement to reporters after the three-hour meeting, 
Denktas remarked that the talks are continuing and the sides are 
trying to understand one another within this framework. He 
pointed out that important issues face the two sides. Noting 
that there is no cause for concern, Denktas explained that 
attempts are under way to determine the agenda. Agreement was 
reached on several matters and conciliation is sought on the 
remaining issues, he added. The president said that he will 
meet with Feissel again if necessary. We tried to reach full 
agreement on the topics discussed during today's meeting, 
Denktas announced, adding that he conveyed the issues that are 
important for the Turkish Cypriot side to the UN officials. 
Pointing out that he also supplied answers for the questions 
put to the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas said that he may hold 
another meeting with Feissel in order to understand the real 
content of the proposals submitted to the Turkish Cypriot side. 
I do not believe that there are differences of opinion between 
the two sides on the main issues, Denktas stated and expressed 
the conviction that everything is in order with regard to the 
indirect talks to begin on 17 February. He said that there are 
still one or two small outstanding points on which the two sides 
are yet to agree and expressed the belief that conciliation will 
be reached on these points as well. 
  In reaction to a Greek Cypriot radio report that the agenda 
for the indirect talks is comprised of six items, Denktas said 
there is no fait accompli on this matter and many aspects 
requested by the Turkish Cypriot side are also included in these 
six items. The six items are derived from the UN secretary 
general's report, Denktas noted, adding that Feissel and his 
colleagues summarized these principles under six items, whereas 
the Turkish Cypriot side expanded them into 12 separate items. 
Denktas remarked that the Turkish Cypriot side is trying to 
base the negotiating process on a solid foundation. The 
president stressed that it is the content and not the number of 
these items that is important. He expressed the belief that the 
items on the agenda cover both the Turkish and Greek Cypriots' 
demands. Denktas concluded by saying that one should not create 
difficulties that do not actually exist. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>
  [Text] Government experts have prepared two documents on 
the confidence-building measures. Based on reliable I SIMERINI 
information, the first document, which contains suggestions and 
observations on specific aspects of the package, is at the 
foreign minister's office and the National Council members can 
pay a visit for a briefing. The second, nine-page document has 
been given to the National Council members in light of their 
scheduled meeting next Tuesday. 
  The confidential document entitled "Basic Principles and 
Positions on the Confidence-Building Measures" does not answer 
any concerns stemming from the UN proposals. Referring to the 
issue of recognition, the document points out that in order for 
there to be recognition of the pseudostate, our side must first 
give its consent. It goes on to suggest that our side reiterate 
its position that it does not intend to recognize the 
pseudostate is added at this point. The document refers 
extensively to passages from UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's report (July) and his recent letter to the two 
sides. 
  The document lists the following as our side's basic 
positions on the confidence-building measures: 
  First: Cyprus' sovereignty will be maintained and 
implementation will not contain elements of direct or indirect 
recognition. 
  Second: UN authority over Nicosia Airport and Varosha will 
be 
temporary and its orders will be in line with the international 
organization's resolutions. 
  Third: Settlement in these two areas is strictly temporary. 
  Fourth: Neither side will change positions. 
  Fifth: An agreement and implementation of the 
confidence-building measures does not imply a Cyprus solution. 
  The first document, which has not been given to the 
political 
leaders, is lengthy and in general describes the Greek Cypriot 
policy and approach on the talks. 
  The documents were prepared by a group of government experts 
(Triandafillidhis, Soulioti, and other officials) as well as 
Brownling and Aimiliou, who work in London. The three documents 
were sent to Brownling last May, when they were submitted to the 
sides, and he decided that there was no issue of recognition. 
The government then sought a second opinion from Greek 
specialists, who warned of the dangers. Following this 
development, a group of experts was formed to study the 
confidence-building measures in detail.

  [Text] In an exclusive statement to the private television 
station ANTENNA, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas was 
explicit in his answers on the UN experts' reports. He insisted 
that although the reports are not part of the 
confidence-building measures package, they include promises made 
to the Turkish Cypriot side by the UN secretary general and UN 
experts on the benefits to the Turkish Cypriots when the 
measures are implemented. 
  He told ANTENNA: "Naturally, we will take whatever is 
included in the reports that will benefit the Turkish Cypriots. 
Nobody can tell us `Don't touch.' We will not throw away the 
reports. They include indications of what we can achieve 
through the confidence-building measures. 
  "The reason the people agreed to the talks is certainly 
related to what can be achieved. How can we say that the 
reports are invalid? Of course they exist and of course they 
are a tool that we will use." 
  The Turkish Cypriot leader said the reports were prepared by 
the experts to be used. "Otherwise, he said, there was no 
reason to prepare them." He continued: "If the reports were 
irrelevant, there was no reason to spend the experts' time and 
money on us. They have spent hours working with us. So, why do 
you, Greek Cypriots, avoid them? I do not understand." 
  Discussing the time frame for Nicosia Airport to reopen and 
Varosha's residents to return to the fenced off area, Denktas 
said this will depend on developments. He said: "Don't forget 
that the reports refer to 18 months for Nicosia Airport to 
reoperate and two to five years for Varosha." 
  Finally, the Turkish Cypriot leader said this week's 
meetings 
aim to prepare an agenda for the proximity talks which will 
begin on 17 February when Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's 
special representative in Cyprus, will be in Cyprus. Denktas 
said: "Clark will arrive in Cyprus on 17 February or a few days 
earlier, and will be with us for a few separate meetings. He 
will then leave us with Gustave Feissel."

  [Text] Mitrofan Studenikin, chairman of the Russian 
Friendship Association with Cyprus who is visiting our country 
at the head of a three-member delegation, told our paper 
yesterday that the association will propose to the Russian 
parliament the establishment of a parliamentary group for 
contacts with Cyprus. 
  Studenikin reiterated the support of his country and 
association for the Cypriot people and stressed that the purpose 
of their visit is to strengthen traditionally friendly relations 
between the Cypriot and Russian peoples, which have recently 
slackened because of the political developments in Russia. 
  Studenikin stressed, however, that the association continues 
to act and work for the good of both peoples. Many Cypriot 
students, workers, and businessmen who live in Russia have 
frequent contacts with the association while a publications 
exhibition on Cyprus was recently organized in Moscow, which was 
successful. 
  During their stay the delegation has met with Foreign 
Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, Archbishop Khrisostomos, the 
secretary and other leading members of the Cyprus-Soviet 
Friendship Society, and representatives of the Association of 
Soviet Higher Educational Institutes Graduates and exchanged 
views aimed at further strengthening the relations between the 
Cypriot and Russian peoples.

  [Text] Ankara, Feb 12 (A.A) -- Turkey on Saturday [12 
February] decided to reinforce its F-16 warplanes, which were 
stationed in Italy's Ghedi base, in a bid to control 
Bosnia-Herzegovina airspace. 
  Turkey said it took the decision after NATO's Southern 
European Allied Forces Commander Micheal Boord's call that an 
air operation will be launched against Serbia if it fails to 
withdraw its forces from Sarajevo in ten days. 
  The 16-membered NATO earlier agreed to order air strikes 
against Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo unless they 
withdraw artillery and other heavy weapons at least 20 km (12 
miles) or put them under U.N. control within 10 days. 
  General Staff spokesman Dogun Silahcioglu told an AA 
reporter 
that with the reinforcement Turkish Air Forces will have 18 F-16 
type warplanes in Ghedi base that will be ready for the air 
operation. 
  Meanwhile, AA learned that Greece did not give permission 
for 
the eight F-16 warplanes to pass through Greek airspace. 
  Officials said Turkish warplanes will pass to Ghedi base 
over 
the Mediterranean Sea on Feb 14.

<F P=106> [Report by Irfan Sapmaz and Selin Caglayan: "Aliyev: I Will </F>
Not Turn My Back on Moscow"] 
  [Text] The balanced policy President Geydar Aliyev is 
trying to maintain toward Ankara and Moscow came to light at the 
end of his contacts in Ankara yesterday. Aliyev asked Turkey to 
increase its arms supplies to Azerbaijan and assured the Turkish 
officials that Russia's military forces can only be deployed in 
his country within the CSCE framework and together with the 
military units of other countries. Aliyev said, however, that he 
will not completely turn his back on Moscow. 
  Replying to the questions Turkish journalists asked him, 
Aliyev asserted: "I shall neither open nor close Azerbaijan's 
door to Moscow. Azerbaijan will remain an independent country." 
  Stressing that Russia is in the region and that it has 
50,000 
troops in Armenia and Georgia, Aliyev said: "Moscow wishes to 
increase the number of its troops. Russian military units guard 
the Armenian and Georgian borders with Turkey. Considering that 
state of affairs, Russia can be described as having intervened 
in the region." 
  Aliyev, who buys arms from the generals in Moscow who are 
known as arms dealers, has asked Turkey to supply more arms to 
Azerbaijan so that Baku can reduce its dependence on Russia. 
Meanwhile, Nedzhmettin Sadykhov, Azerbaijan's former chief of 
staff who has accompanied Aliyev to Turkey as his military 
adviser, is holding talks with military officials in Ankara. 
  Aliyev has asked President Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller 
to agree to send more officers to Azerbaijan to train the 
military units of that republic. Demirel and Ciller have 
promised every kind of aid to Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Ankara -- Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who 
is continuing his visit to Turkey at the invitation of President 
Suleyman Demirel, held various contacts yesterday. Aliyev 
indicated that the talks on the oil pipeline will be concluded 
with the Western and Turkish firms this month and agreements 
will be signed in their aftermath. 
  In replying to questions from reporters at the hotel where 
he 
is staying, Aliyev pointed out that Azerbaijani oil is linked 
with the political situation in the country. He said: "We will 
conclude agreements with the American and British firms. But, 
in return, Britain and the United States must support 
Azerbaijan." 
<H5>  Russia's Role </H5>
  In rely to a question on Russia's role in the region, the 
Azerbaijani President Aliyev said: "Russia is already in the 
region. Russia keeps 23,000 troops in Armenia. It even wants 
to increase their number. Russia also has troops in Georgia. 
It wants to raise the number of troops there to the level 
existing in Armenia. The borders of Georgia and Armenia with 
Turkey are being defended by Russia. Russia has already 
interfered in the region." 
  Indicting that there are no Russian troops in Azerbaijan, 
Aliyev said: "We will definitely not allow them in. Azerbaijan 
will not hand over its independence to anyone." 
  In referring to reports that Russia is supporting the former 
President Mutalibov against him, Aliyev said: "They cannot 
support anyone against me. No one has the power to support 
either Mutalibov or Elchibey against me." 
  Aliyev also received and met for a while with Bulent Ecevit, 
leader of Democratic Left party. 
  During the part of the meeting open to reporters, Aliyev 
said 
that his meetings with President Suleyman Demirel and Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller were very beneficial and that the ties 
between the two countries will be further consolidated. Ecevit 
said he shares the same wish. 
  On the other hand, Hacettepe University conferred on Aliyev 
the decree of "honorary doctorate on international relations." 
  When Aliyev arrived in the university campus to receive the 
honor, he was met by a group of protesting Azerbaijani students. 
The Azerbaijani president, who was given the doctorate honor by 
the university rector Professor Yuksel Bozer, said that 
Azerbaijan has now attained the long-aspired independence and 
that it will never relinquish it. 
  Indicating that Azerbaijan has always pursued peace in its 
foreign policy but that this is not being implemented due to the 
Armenian attacks, Aliyev said: "We are not the attacking side. 
We are only fighting against Armenians attacking us. We want 
an end to aggression against Azerbaijan and the liberation of 
the Azerbaijani lands from the Armenian occupation. We will 
defend our lands and independence to the very end." 
  Aliyev also met and talked for awhile with Deniz Baykal, the 
leader of the Republican People's Party. Aliyev called for 
unity among Azerbaijanis in Azerbaijan, Turkey, and elsewhere in 
the world.

independent state, the Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev said: 
"I will neither close nor open the door for the Russian troops. 
We cannot know what the future might bring." 
  In reply to questions by a group of reporters, Aliyev said 
the route of the oil pipeline will be finalized only after the 
signing of a protocol with the foreign firms in Baku. 
  In firmly rejecting the claims that he is Moscow's man, 
Aliyev said such accusations are lies disseminated by Elchibey 
and his supporters with whom the Turkish press sympathizes. 
  Bulent Ecevit, the leader of Democratic Left Party, visited 
Aliyev. In a statement after the meeting, Ecevit said it is 
highly important for Nakhichevan and Azerbaijan to be connected. 
He added that Turkey's stance on the issue has been 
insufficient and passive.

  [Text] [Advan] Esteemed President, what were you expecting 
from your visit to Turkey, and what did you achieve in your 
talks in Ankara? Could you make a general assessment? 
  [Aliyev] My visit to Turkey aims at further developing the 
ties between Azerbaijan and Turkey, both on the level of states 
and peoples. Moved by this consideration, I accepted the 
invitation of the honorable President of Turkey Suleyman 
Demirel, who is our dear friend and brother, and came to Turkey. 
We held talks to solve these issues at the state level and to 
work out concrete measures. We held very fruitful and important 
talks, as a result of which we signed almost 16 agreements and 
protocols. Each of them is of the utmost importance and signals 
the direction of the future development of relations between the 
Turkish and Azerbaijani states. 
  [Advan] An agreement on friendship and the development of 
multifaceted cooperation was also signed between Turkey and 
Azerbaijan yesterday. It includes an interesting article, which 
stresses that if either of the two contracting parties comes 
under any attack the other country will take the necessary 
measures against the aggressor. Do you think that this article 
will elicit a reaction from Russia? 
  [Aliyev] If we have indeed attached our signature to such an 
article then we must remain true to that article. 
  [Advan] Could we now consider the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline 
as 
a done deal? What measures were envisaged in this regard? 
  [Aliyev] I issued a presidential instruction whereby I 
ordered the Azerbaijani Oil Company to conduct talks and 
finalize contracts with Western companies. Now, these talks 
will be held. It could be that at these talks the sides might 
agree or disagree with certain issues. This is only natural. 
Once these contracts are finalized, the oil pipeline issue will 
also be resolved. I do not doubt that the oil pipeline will 
pass through Turkey.

Geydar Aliyev] 
  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev held a news 
conference prior to his departure from Turkey at which he stated 
that cooperation between the two countries is expanding. 
  Noting that they had requested 100,000 tonnes of grain from 
Turkey, Aliyev stated that their request was received favorably. 
  Stating that they had no territorial demands from Armenia, 
Aliyev added that Azerbaijan wanted only the political and 
economic return of the mountainous Karabakh region and the 
occupied territories. 
  In answer to a question by a correspondent on whether the 
PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist organization was active 
in Azerbaijan, Aliyev replied: There is no way this terrorist 
organization can function in Azerbaijan. We are against all 
initiatives in that direction. We will eradicate all efforts of 
that organization to function. 
  Following the news conference, Aliyev visited the grave of 
Turgut Ozal to lay a wreath at the tombstone. Aliyev later 
departed Turkey.

  [Text] Turkey and Azerbaijan have stated that the upper 
Karabakh region is an integral part of Azerbaijan, and called on 
Armenia to stop its attacks. Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev, concluding his official visit, left Turkey. 
  The joint communique on the visit states that during the 
meetings, which were conducted in a friendly, brotherly, and 
respectful atmosphere, views were exchanged on bilateral 
relations as well as regional and international issues. 
  Adamantly condemning the Armenian attacks on Azerbaijan, the 
communique further notes: During the meetings it was determined 
that more than 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory is occupied 
by Armenia; that more than 1 million Azeris are refugees in 
their own land; and that the United Nations is not implementing 
its Resolutions 822, 853, 874, and 884. Confirming once more 
that the upper Karabakh region is an integral part of 
Azerbaijan, both countries called on Armenia to stop its attacks 
on Azerbaijan. Turkey and Azerbaijan stated that Armenia is held 
accountable internationally for violating the peace and security 
in the region, and for forcefully standing against the 
international norms. 
  According to the communique, President Suleyman Demirel 
accepted an invitation from Aliyev to visit Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Ankara -- Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev 
arrived in Turkey Tuesday [8 February] with a delegation of 160 
people to sign a series of accords between the two countries 
that share a common cultural heritage. 
  Aliyev's first official visit to Ankara has a hectic 
schedule, which includes his receiving an honorary degree on 
international law from Hacettepe University. 
  While in Turkey, Aliyev will sign various economic accords 
including a protocol to establish a working committee to assess 
existing border accords and explore the possibilities of signing 
a new agreement in this area. 
  The last accord, signed in 1921 between Turkey and the 
ex-Soviet Union, gives Turkey the right of guarantee over the 
status of Nakhichevan, an Azeri enclave in Armenia bordering 
Turkey and Iran. 
  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Turkish and 
Azeri officials said in the past that such an accord was under 
consideration, but took no steps toward formulating one until 
recently. 
  Diplomatic sources said the working groups will work on 
various drafts as well as the "right time" for signing such an 
accord. 
  Various Turkish officials have said in the past that "Turkey 
could not stand back and watch in case of an Armenian attack on 
Nakhichevan." 
  The presence of Shamsaddin Khanbabayev, the president of the 
Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, indicates that the issue will 
have priority in the talks in Ankara. 
  Other issues of priority, diplomatic sources have said, is 
Turkish aid to Azerbaijan and the diplomatic support it can 
extend in stopping Armenian violation of Azeri territory. 
President Suleyman Demirel, who brushed aside protocol to meet 
Aliyev at the airport, said Turkey considered the "Minsk 
mechanism" as the appropriate forum to solve the Azeri-Armenian 
problem. 
  The so called "Minsk group" operates within the context of 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] and 
has been seeking a settlement to the Azeri-Armenian conflict. 
"I believe the problems of Azeris can be solved in a just way 
which guarantees Azeri territorial integrity," Demirel said. 
  He added that Ankara would continue to support Azerbaijan in 
international fora on this issue. 
  "But we will not stop at that," the Turkish president said. 
  "When Azerbaijan, as a democratic state, launches its 
reconstruction, Turkey will continue to be of assistance with 
all its means.' 
  Aliyev, in turn, expressed his confidence in the CSCE's 
efforts for ending the Azeri-Armenian conflict. 
  "We have confidence in the Minsk group. We also have 
confidence in the efforts of major states," Aliyev said. A 
high-level Turkish diplomat interpreted these words as a sign 
that Azerbaijan wants the tripartite peace plan--put forward by 
Turkey, Russia and U.S.--to be brought back to the table. 
  "The plan, which stipulates a ceasefire and Armenian 
withdrawal from Azeri lands, has long been kept on hold. but 
the Azeris, worried that a sole Russian initiative would 
legitimize Armenia's gains, want this or similar initiatives to 
complement the Minsk process," the diplomat said. 
<H5>  Turkey To Approach Aliyev on Human Rights </H5>
  Meanwhile, Turkey will reportedly stress the importance it 
places on human rights and democratic developments in Azerbaijan 
during the talks headed by the two presidents. Turkish 
diplomatic sources have indicated that Turkey feels the jailing 
of former political leaders and closing down newspapers does not 
reflect a good image for Baku government. 
  The issue of human rights violations in Azerbaijan had 
reportedly been put to the Turkish government "at various 
levels" by a Popular [People's] Front delegation which visited 
Turkey right before Aliyev. 
  In a move to protest Aliyev's policies, the Azerbaijan 
Cultural Association refused to meet him during his visit to 
Turkey although a meeting had been scheduled for this morning. 
Turkish and Azeri officials have said that "all aspects of ties 
and regional problems" would be discussed in the talks. 
  But Aliyev's opening remarks that "Azerbaijan was in the 
process of establishing its own national army to drive the 
Armenian aggressors out" indicated that possible Turkish 
assistance in military training would be high on the Azeri 
agenda. 
  Ankara has been involved in the training of Azeri officers 
both in Turkey and in Azerbaijan. 
  Aliyev, who will address the Turkish parliament today, is 
expected to appeal to Turkey for support in ending the Armenian 
occupation of Azeri soil. 
  The 160 member delegation, which arrived in Ankara's 
Esenboga 
Airport in two planes, also includes the head of the Azeri oil 
company SOCAR, which is part of a consortium for an Azeri oil 
pipeline project which includes the Turkish pipeline company 
BOTAS. 
  Turkish officials indicated before the visit that they saw 
talks with Aliyev as a "good opportunity" to reassess the 
pipeline project which had been dormant for a while due to 
Azerbaijan's domestic problems. 
  The presence of BOTAS chairman Hayrettin Uzun in the 
official 
talks indicated that the pipeline would be discussed. Aliyev 
has recently told Amaco, the American Oil Company in the same 
consortium, that the Azeri parliament will make a decision on 
the route of the pipeline by March. 
  Ankara wants the Azeri oil to be brought with pipeline via 
Turkey to the Mediterranean coast and exported to Europe from 
there.

<F P=106> [Report by Irfan Sapmaz and Selin Caglayan: "Aliyev Will </F>
Seek a Security Guarantee From Turkey"] 
  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev, a former member of the USSR 
Politbureau, arrived in Ankara yesterday. He will be seeking a 
security guarantee against Moscow. Aliyev has been in power in 
Azerbaijan for 100 days. He wants to use his visit, which 
follows recent Azerbaijani victories on the battlefronts in the 
Caucasus, to convey the message to the Azerbaijani people that 
"former President Elchibey's era in Azerbaijan has ended and a 
new chapter will be opened between Ankara and Baku." 
<H5>  Warning to Opponents </H5>
  Ankara wants to use the visit to end the chill between 
Turkey 
and Azerbaijan by removing the Turkish people's negative views 
of Aliyev and the conviction that "Azerbaijan cannot exist 
without Elchibey." Ankara wants to use the visit to convey to 
the Azerbaijani people and to Moscow that it supports Aliyev. 
  Ankara knows Aliyev has a reputation as someone who is 
supported by Moscow. But he is also known to have resisted 
Russia during the past few months. Considering that, Ankara 
will try to ease Aliyev's anxiety over the extent of the support 
Turkey is prepared to give him. 
  President Demirel has said that Ankara is prepared to 
provide 
the support Azerbaijan needs. Demirel tried to ensure that 
Aliyev was warmly welcomed in Turkey. He disregarded the new 
rules on protocol and met his guest at Esenboga Airport. 
Replying to an Azerbaijani correspondent's question, Demirel 
said: "We embrace the person who represents Azerbaijan. We 
embrace Azerbaijan when we embrace Aliyev. Azerbaijan has a 
very special place in Turkey's heart." 
<H5>  Security Is Aliyev's Main Problem </H5>
  Turkey and Azerbaijan will sign 15 agreements during 
Aliyev's 
visit. This means that all the agreements signed when Abulfaz 
Elchibey was in power in Azerbaijan will be signed again. 
Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov has said that the two sides will 
discuss Azerbaijan's problems with Russia. He stressed: "There 
is nothing we wish to conceal from Turkey." 
  Gasanov said that the memorandum to be signed between the 
two 
sides will also include provisions on issues relating to 
security.

  [Text] Ankara, Feb 12 (AFP) -- A policeman and 19 Kurdish 
separatist rebels have been killed in a skirmish with security 
forces at Silopi, near Turkey's border with Iraq, local 
officials said Saturday [12 February]. 
  A group from the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) fell into an 
ambush Friday evening while attacking government offices with 
missile-launchers, according to security officials at 
Diyarbakir, responsible for the predominantly Kurdish eastern 
regions now under a state of emergency. 
  In Istanbul, the military wing of the PKK claimed 
responsibility for a bomb explosion Saturday morning in Tuzla, 
60 kilometres (38 miles) east of the city, which killed five 
people and wounded at least 30, according to the latest toll. 
  All of the dead or wounded were army officer cadets. The 
home-made bomb, hidden in a rubbish bin at a railway station, 
went off shortly after they were let out for the weekend. 
  A press statement released later by the pro-Kurdish agency 
Kurd-A said the bombing was carried out by an "underground 
revenge group" of the Popular Army for the Liberation of 
Kurdistan. 
  Some 60 people have been killed this month alone in 
separatist skirmishes in the east and southeast of the country, 
according to an AFP tally based on official reports. There has 
been a total of 11,000 deaths, including 3,300 civilians, since 
the start of the Kurdish rebellion in 1984.

<F P=106> [Report by Sinan Onus] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--It has been learned that the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] will replace its provincial commanders in 
the near future. The provincial commanders in Zhalah [northern 
Iraq and western Iran], Botan [region around Hakkari], and Amed 
[region around Diyarbakir] have already been replaced. The only 
area in which changes will not be made is Dersim [region around 
Tunceli], one of the eight provinces. KURD-A will issue a 
statement once the commanders in the remaining provinces are 
also replaced. 
  It has been reported that soon after the replacement of the 
provincial commanders, the PKK will make a "call for peace" on 
the eve of local elections. 
  The PKK has thus far replaced the commanders in three 
provinces. Numan Celik replaced Osman Ocalan [brother of 
Abdullah Ocalan] in Zhalah. Murat Karayilan was appointed to 
Botan. "Munzur" replaced Semdin Sakik in Amed. From among the 
replaced provincial commanders, only Munzur is "more moderate" 
compared to the commander he replaced. 
  Doctor Baran, the commander of Dersim Province, remains in 
his post. It was reported that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan gave 
the following reason for these changes: "Younger provincial 
commanders are being appointed. A rejuvenation operation has 
started inside PKK."

  [Text] Ankara -- Security forces and militants of the 
outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) fought for hours in 
the border town of Cizre this week, as tension reached a peak 
during a state campaign to repopulate the settlement. 
  Local sources told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that two people 
were killed and 35 shops were destroyed in the clash, which 
began on Monday and continued until Tuesday morning. Sources 
said the fighting erupted with a PKK bomb attack on an armoured 
vehicle parked in the street. Witnesses noted that security 
forces had helped locals back to their houses before the clash 
began, telling them not to come out, for their own safety. 
  Anti-aircraft guns, RPG rocket launchers, light anti-tank 
weapons and machine guns were used in the clash, during which a 
branch office of the Ziraat bank and several PTT buildings were 
hit. The Cizre office of the pro-Kurdish OZGUR GUNDEM was hit 
by two rockets. Witnesses said that if the security forces had 
not escorted residents back to their homes, there could have 
been many casualties. 
  On Tuesday the OZGUR GUNDEM reported on its front page that 
a 
total of 16 civilians, two of them children, had been killed in 
Cizre over the past month. 
  Locals suspect that there is a systematic campaign underway 
to influence the results of Cizre's polls in the upcoming March 
27 local elections. In the past month, dozens of families 
living in the Cudi neighborhood of the town have reportedly been 
forced out of their homes by paramilitary village guards, who 
moved in. Other houses were torched so that they could no 
longer be used. On Monday, police raided the office of the 
Cizre reporter of SABAH newspaper, Ramazan Imrag. They abducted 
him and took him to a nearby government building, where he was 
beaten for hours. Imrag said he suspected that he was being 
punished for reporting on developments in Cizre to Sabah's 
private television channel, ATV. He was told that this was a 
"warning" and if he continued to do "what he had been doing," he 
would be killed. Recently, state forces in the region started a 
campaign along with influential tribe leaders to repopulate 
crucial settlements which are known to sympathize with the PKK. 
  In Diyarbakir, there was a "march to condemn terrorism" this 
weekend, during which a total of about 250 people marched 
through the streets, shouting slogans against the PKK and in 
favor of the Army and police. They were protected by hundreds 
of policemen. 
  About 10 days ago, another group marched through Cizre, 
shouting anti-PKK slogans. Both in Diyarbakir and Cizre, those 
appearing in the streets were Kurdish village guards, who are 
paid fixed salaries by the state to combat the PKK. Sources in 
Cizre told the TDN on Tuesday that village guards had recently 
started detaining and interrogating suspects as well, and that 
many locals placed under custody were not taken to the police 
station but directly to the house of the chief village guard, 
Kamil Atak. At least seven of those detained in this way are 
now reported missing. Sources say that, because of the state's 
new campaign, some 3,000 voters in this town are no longer 
eligible to vote, and this will seriously affect the outcome of 
the March elections. Democracy Party (DEP) deputy Selim Sadak 
on Tuesday confirmed the report stating that many voters were 
not registered in the area, whereas village guards were. He 
said this was [as published] undermined the credibility of the 
elections.

<F P=106> [Column by Sedat Ergin: "Stalemate in the Talks With Syria </F>
on Terrorism" -- all punctuation as published] 
  [Text] Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' conveyed 
similar views to Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller during the tripartite summit in Istanbul 
on Friday, 4 February. He said: "Yes, we agree that a problem 
does not exist at the present time. However, we wish to 
consider the future on matters related to the transnational 
waters. Our producers and farmers wish to see a document on 
that vital matter, which concerns their future..." 
  The views al-Shar' conveyed merely reiterated Syria's 
position. Recalling that Turkish statesmen signed protocols 
calling for "an agreement between the two countries on 
transnational waters," al- Shar' urged that the two sides move 
to hold talks on the matter. Meanwhile, he asked: "Why have 
Turkish officials failed to fulfill their promises?" 
  Likewise, Hikmet Cetin's and Tansu Ciller's views reiterated 
Turkey's position. For example, Cetin responded: "We do not 
wish to create a problem for Syria on the question of 
transnational waters. However, considering the anxiety of our 
press, parliament, and people about acts of terrorism and their 
conviction that Syria supports terrorist activities, we cannot 
conclude an agreement with your country at the present time. 
This state of affairs must be removed. No anxiety must exist 
over security. Under the existing conditions, concluding an 
agreement on transnational waters may be interpreted as a step 
linked with terrorist activities. That would be wrong. A 
problem does not exist on the supply of transnational waters at 
the present time. Why do you not agree to cooperate to remove 
our anxiety about terrorist activities?..." 
  The Syrian foreign minister responded: "Syria does not 
support terrorist activities against Turkey. That is 
impossible. Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] camps do not exist 
in the al-Biqa' Valley. We have conferred with Lebanese 
officials on that matter. Not a single camp remains. 
Furthermore, PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is not in Syria." 
  An interesting point was that al-Shar' went as far as saying 
that "Abdullah Ocalan has several European passports and is able 
to use them to freely travel anywhere he wishes." 
  Cetin insisted that the Turkish side has evidence confirming 
that Ocalan is still in Syria. Al-Shar' replied: "That may 
have been so in the past. However, he is not in Syria at the 
present time. We are committed to the promise we have made. We 
cannot be involved in any terrorist activity against Turkey. 
How can we support an initiative against Turkey's territorial 
integrity when we support Iran's and Iraq's territorial 
integrity? That would also affect Syria." 
  Obviously, Syria has not made a significant change in its 
position, regardless of Turkey's persistent diplomacy on 
terrorism and high-level U.S. pressure. Syria continues to 
demand that past Turkish promises be fulfilled and Ankara, 
suspending its past promises, insists that "the question of 
security be settled before the question of transnational waters 
is resolved. 
  The only important element in the dialogue between the two 
countries is the limited steps Syria has recently taken on the 
PKK problem. A high-ranking government official informed us 
yesterday: "We have received several reports on that matter. We 
are aware that Abdullah Ocalan is in Syria. However, it seems 
that his freedom of movement has been considerably reduced." 
  This was an indication that certain steps have been taken by 
Syria on the problem. 
  The present issue is that the limited measures Damascus has 
taken have not been effective enough to convince Turkey to 
reconsider its approach on the question of transnational waters. 
Syria continues to hide Abdullah Ocalan, who it regards as the 
most important trump card in its relations with Turkey. 
  All this indicates that a stalemate has emerged in the chess 
game between the two countries.

  [Text] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has said 
that his party will get at least 15 million votes and 1,000 
mayoral positions in the 27 March local elections. 
  Addressing crowds in Karaman, Erbakan said that the country 
has been going through a bitter experiment over the past 50 
years and now wants to return to a national party. Nobody can 
prevent us from coming to power, he said, or from establishing a 
great Turkey. 
  Erbakan alleged that certain circles are nervous because the 
Prosperity Party will come to power soon. Our correspondent 
Omer Kebapcioglu reports that Erbakan said: Those circles are 
those who brought the country to the brink of collapse with 
their inefficiency. 
  Addressing a ceremony in Konya, Erbakan recalled that the 
Prosperity Party was in power for four years as the partner of a 
coalition. He added: We carried out the great leap of heavy 
industry. We raised wheat production from 10 million tonnes to 
18 million tonnes. We raised meat production from 125,000 
tonnes to 625,000 tonnes. We set up factories in all corners of 
the country. That is what the Prosperity Party did. We did not 
take a single cent in foreign loans in four years. We did not 
raise taxes by a single kurus. We kept the value of our money 
stable by keeping it at 16.5 Turkish lira per U.S. dollar. 
Naturally, we pursued a dignified foreign policy. When the 
United States placed an arms embargo on our peace operation in 
Cyprus, we closed down its bases. Therefore, we manufactured our 
own weapons. That is what the Prosperity Party did, and that is 
what it will do.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou with </F>
unidentified correspondents following a Government Committee 
meeting in the Chamber of Deputies building--live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent, in progress] ....FYROM [Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. This recognition comes when 
Greek-U.S. relations are on a very good level. Do you believe 
it could shake these relations? Do you believe this recognition 
spells a worse course for the Skopje issue? 
  [Papandreou] These are two questions: First, certainly it 
has some repercussions for Greek-U.S. relations. We have 
expressed our strong displeasure, but we would like to believe 
that the wording of the decision that was adopted -- it does not 
use the word pressure but refers to exercising influence 
concerning the issue of differences, as they are called in the 
document, between Greece and Skopje -- may be utilized, I say 
probably be utilized, positively. This is something we expect 
but we don't know. On Skopje, you asked a second question.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Does this development spell 
something worse.... 
  [Papandreou, interrupting] Look, I think it encourages Kiro 
Gligorov, who does not live the reality. The reality is that 
Greece is in a position to isolate this country economically if 
Greece so decides. If it makes that decision, it would mean 
collapse. We are--in a strange irony--virtually the only Balkan 
country with no territorial designs on Skopje. Opposition 
between us and Skopje increases. I believe that Gligorov, no 
matter how many countries recognize him, cannot escape the basic 
question: What would Greece do? Greece can do a lot. I 
believe this will be understood by our friends, our allies, 
everyone. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, right up until the U.S. 
recognition of Skopje was announced officially, did the Greek 
side, did you personally, do anything to avert this action? 
  [Papandreou] Look, I can say this: First, I talked to 
President Clinton in Brussels. Second, I had high level 
contacts about three days ago. I don't know, I cannot give 
details, but I did what I thought was possible and decent on our 
part. There is also the issue of decency and pride. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, in its recognition 
announcement, the United States uses the phrase: Differences 
between Greece and Skopje. I would like you to comment on this 
placing of an ally on the same footing as a country that until a 
while ago was hostile to America. 
  [Papandreou] I agree with the reasoning behind your 
question. 
This is why we expressed our strong displeasure. We could not 
return to a dialogue unless our three conditions were satisfied. 
We follow a policy of two stages, two phases: The first phase 
concerns the [Macedonian] constitution, the emblem of the 
Veryina Sun, and propaganda. The second phase then is that we 
go toward some economic normalization, primarily in the economic 
sector [as heard]. But dialogue starts on other issues, 
including the name, on which our positions remain irrevocable. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, Andonios Samaras [opposition 
Political Spring party chairman] said yesterday that, according 
to his information, the Skopjeans are giving nothing; they won't 
even change [their] flag in return. He also discussed either a 
struggle by the government or its resignation. Would you 
comment on this statement by Samaras? 
  [Papandreou] I don't think there is any reason to comment on 
it. There is no reason to comment on it. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, based on information that 
you 
already have, do you believe that a concession by Skopje at a 
later stage based on Greek demands is feasible? 
  [Papandreou] I am optimistic but insistence, patience, and 
determination, which we have, are necessary. We are prudent but 
we don't forget our national interests. We have a duty both to 
the nation and the people. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, could it be that the 
recognition, this action by the U.S. side, occupies you ahead of 
your visit to the United States the date for which has already 
been announced? 
  [Papandreou] No. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, do you think you might 
propose to the president holding a conference of the political 
leaders. The official opposition party, through Chairman 
Miltiadhis Evert, today called at least for the formation of a 
national council on foreign policy. 
  [Papandreou] Well, it is a proposal. It has some meaning. 
We will consider the proposal. Concerning a meeting chaired by 
Konstandinos Karamanlis, there is not actually any objection; it 
is a matter of time as to when we and, naturally, the president 
will decide on it. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, would you like to comment 
on the NATO decision yesterday on Bosnia? 
  [Papandreou] Yes, it is very unfortunate. It is an 
absolutely wrong, guilty decision, because: How did the 
Yugoslav crisis begin? Who is responsible for the crisis? 
Unfortunately, it is [the responsibility] of the European 
Community, you know. It is a responsibility that Greece, 
unfortunately, also shared fully. We should not forget this. 
There are tremendous responsibilities in this. Since 16 
December [1991], the course has been charted. Now we have 
military intervention to implement peace. It is an incongruous 
scheme. The military intervention has no goal. What is the 
goal of the intervention? Is it to strike at one of the three 
parties to the dispute and the conflict--Serbia? Is it designed 
to make it bend on its knees? What problem would this solve in 
the region and what are the possibilities of the war expanding? 
I don't want to be more precise or any clearer this time. But 
there is a possibility of the war expanding. We adopted a firm 
stance at the NATO summit, which is why the decision then was 
quite good. I don't forget, we should not forget, that the 
European Union's decision on Monday was a great success for the 
Greek Presidency, I believe. But the same foreign ministers, 
within the NATO framework, have decided on something that, in my 
opinion, is a major blunder. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, why didn't the Greek side 
exercise the right of veto. 
  [Papandreou] It can, it could. It did not exercise it 
because then we would also have become part of the Yugoslav 
crisis. We have undertaken a responsibility. We said clearly 
why we are not participating and we will not allow the AWACS 
[Airborne Warning And Control System] to move from Aktion or the 
Greek crews to participate in the AWACS in the event of war. 
Greece is very, very clear: We are staying out of the military 
intervention in the Balkans. We consider it disastrous. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, given the major crisis in 
Bosnia and the possibility of a more general conflagration, how 
do you judge the U.S. move to recognize Skopje? Does it 
contribute to stabilization or does it contribute to 
destabilization? 
  [Papandreou] Our position is clear: It does not contribute 
to stabilization. What would contribute to that is pressure to 
have concessions made, that is, to eliminate the aggressive, 
irredentist nature of this state so that we can return to a 
dialogue. Then, there would be normalization and a contribution 
to peace in the region. 
  [Correspondent] You pinned many hopes on the White House. 
Have they been belied now? Could it be that this option was 
wrong? 
  [Papandreou] Look, it is not an issue of an option. It was a 
good--and there is a good--relationship. And a good personal 
relationship between was created this time between President 
Clinton and me. But we know very well that no states, certainly 
not the superpowers, move on the basis of personal friendship or 
partisan identities or positioning. They move on the basis of 
strategic interests, as they interpret them.

  [Excerpts] The government yesterday issued its strongest 
warning to Skopje that "Greece's patience is running out." The 
warning was issued in case Skopje increases its provocations 
against Athens. 
  Following Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's statement 
Thursday [10 February] night at the presidential palace 
regarding the end of dialogue with Skopje, the government 
spokesman yesterday spoke with equally strong language when he 
issued a harsh warning to Skopje. 
  The government reminded [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov 
that the recent international recognitions of his state do not 
diminish for Skopje the importance of normalizing relations with 
Greece at all. [passage omitted] 
  In this way, the government is attempting to send a message 
in "two directions:" 
  First, to the government of Skopje not to continue 
provocative statements or actions due to the "comfort" of the 
recent recognitions. 
  Second, to the international community to refrain from 
encouraging Skopje by taking further actions that would actually 
force the Greek Government to harden its stance toward Skopje. 
  Yesterday the government spokesman repeated that "there is 
no 
sense in a dialogue" if Skopje does not show specific and 
practical signs of satisfying the Greek conditions. 
  However, the government is not willing at this time to 
indicate what moves and measures it intends to take to pressure 
Skopje. 
  However, the government's policy in the diplomatic and 
economic fields is already under review and reform, but with no 
specific indications as to how it will move, except to say there 
is a "specific time limit" to its patience. 
  For his part, Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou 
yesterday insisted on the need to review Greece's policy toward 
Skopje. Replying to criticism by the opposition regarding the 
dangers of ending the dialogue, he described the prime 
minister's statement in this regard as a "rhetorical phrase."

  [Text] Greece is doing a lot more than it makes public on 
the Skopje issue, and this is a basic principle of its foreign 
policy. This statement was made today in Thessaloniki by 
Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos. Asked to comment on 
information regarding the increased U.S. presence in Skopje, 
Venizelos said: 
  [Begin recording] [Venizelos] I do not want to comment on 
this possibility. I would instead like to remind you of the 
government's basic statement of last Friday [11 February]: that 
there are limits to Greece's patience in awaiting practical 
indications that Skopje has accepted its conditions, and these 
limits are being reached. No one should underestimate this 
message, which has many addressees. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Have there been any 
conciliatory signs from Skopje since the government's statement? 
  [Venizelos] There was a letter from [Macedonian President 
Kiro] Gligorov to U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday -- 
Thursday night -- which had provocative contents for Greece. 
  [Correspondent] And the dialogue? 
  [Venizelos] The dialogue will depend on practical signs of 
Skopje accepting Greece's conditions. I repeat that Greece can 
only participate in a dialogue following specific and practical 
signs that Skopje has accepted its conditions. This position 
remains absolutely and firmly in effect. [end recording]

  [Text] Officially, Skopje appears intransigent, but 
according to a report from Skopje by an ET-3 [Athens Television 
Network] correspondent, it may soon show prudence and a 
willingness for reconciliation. 
  [Begin Bambis Bikas recording] A high level diplomatic 
official and main member of Skopje's negotiating team, who did 
not want to be identified, told ET-3 exclusively that the three 
Greek conditions have been accepted for some time, and that 
Skopje is ready to discuss all issues under dispute with Greece. 
  In a private discussion, this distinguished diplomat and 
close associate of [Macedonian] President Kiro Gligorov outlined 
the direction that relations between the two countries will 
follow. He said we should leave behind the period in which the 
symbols of our differences prevailed, allow time for tensions to 
relax, soften our voices, and view the issues in their real 
dimensions. He added: The U.S. recognition ended a cycle and 
leads things in the above direction. A move by our side will 
soon induce the Greek side to move accordingly, but Greece 
should help us by showing practically that it is indeed 
interested in improving relations. If the people here see from 
the approach of the two sides that they will have specific 
gains, then they will think it is to their benefit for Skopje to 
make an offer to Greece. 
  Finally, this high level diplomat of the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia told us that the government of Andreas 
Papandreou and the ministry of Karolos Papoulias really want the 
two sides to move toward defusing tensions and normalizing 
relations. He stressed: We know there is a willingness for 
something like this, but first there should be a reduction of 
tension, less shrill tones, and then a resumption of 
negotiations. There will be a jointly accepted solution to all 
unsettled issues. Anyway, no one is interested in the flag with 
the Star of Veryina, a symbol which our people do not associate 
with very much. Regarding the name, we can easily agree on a 
compromise solution, without a winner or loser, which will 
benefit both peoples, provided the above cooling off period is 
allowed. [end recording]

  [Text] The Executive Committee of the Thessaloniki chapter 
of the Union of Municipalities and Communes of Greece today 
submitted a resolution to James Blanford, U.S. consul general in 
Thessaloniki, protesting the U.S. decision to recognize Skopje. 
Konstandinos Kosmopoulos, Thessaloniki mayor and committee 
president, headed the committee. Correspondent Dhespina Khari 
reports: 
  [Begin Khari recording] The resolution addressed to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and the U.S. Administration stresses that 
this action is against the historical [word indistinct] of the 
symbols and boundaries of Greece, since they are threatened if 
this situation continues. Consequently, it also threatens to 
ignite the greater Balkan region. Finally, the resolution 
stresses that the current stance of the United States fatally 
injures the traditional friendship between the Greek and 
American people. It also creates an adverse climate for the 
United States from the Greeks who expected understanding and 
justice from our great ally. The resolution asks the United 
States to exert pressure on Skopje to eliminate all those 
aspects that obstruct the development of good relations with 
this state, including the name, symbols, propaganda, and 
expansionist designs. 
  In a statement, Kosmopoulos emphasized that this U.S. action 
has shaken Greece, called on the government to take a position 
on the issue, and noted that people and leadership should 
finally unite to face the critical issues of the country. 
  The mayors of Macedonian towns plan to hold an extraordinary 
meeting 19 February to decide on new initiatives in the 
framework of the local administrations and submit proposals to 
the Central Committee for dealing with the issue further. It 
has not been ruled out that they will propose new dynamic 
mobilization, similar to the rally of 14 February 1992 in 
Thessaloniki and the one in Athens in 1993. [end recording]

  [Text] Miltiadhis Evert, New Democracy and official 
opposition leader, has returned from a long visit to European 
capitals and once again described the government's decision to 
cut off dialogue on the Skopje issue at the United Nations as a 
mistake. Correspondent Elli Triandafillou has the following 
report: 
  [Triandafillou] Speaking upon his return at the airport, 
Evert said he promoted the national positions during his 
contacts. He called on all Greek politicians to follow his 
example and visit foreign countries to help elevate the 
country's prestige, which, he claimed, is at a very low level. 
He also noted that his party's proposal for the signing of an 
agreement guaranteeing peace and unchanged borders in the 
Balkans is welcomed abroad. He added that the government should 
undertake an initiative to implement this because this way 
Turkey's expansionist plans in our region will be foiled. He 
also stressed that domestic disputes among political parties 
should not extend to foreign affairs and underlined that the 
Greek presidency of the European Union should succeed. 
  Referring to the developments on the Skopje issue, the 
official opposition leader repeated that the government made a 
mistake in abandoning the negotiations within the UN framework. 
Evert said that Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou's 
clarification, that the prime minister's statement about ending 
the dialogue with neighboring Skopje was a "rhetorical 
statement" is ironic. 
  Responding to a question on remarks by Sotirios Kouvelas 
[New 
Democracy prominent deputy and former state minister] in which 
he criticized New Democracy's opposition policy, Evert said he 
will listen to all views, but made it clear that the final 
decisions are up to him. 
  Evert will go to Paris in February to meet with French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur. He also plans to meet German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Skopje's `Victory'"] </F>
  [Text] A three-year cycle on the issue of Skopje closed 
with the recognition of the little state by the United States in 
a very bad way, for our country. Now is not the time to point 
out and assign blame for the mistakes which, to a great extend, 
caused the current development in the issue. 
  Anyway, it has been stressed many times in this column that 
all our political parties, either in the government or 
opposition, are equally responsible for the current situation. 
  Recalling the handling of the Skopje issue is particularly 
harmful today. First, because it keeps the Skopje issue on the 
level of unproductive and disorienting disputes among the 
political parties. Second, because the next phase of the issue 
is the most critical one since it will definitely lead to a 
certain "solution" to the issue. Consequently, this phase calls 
for a new national policy that will be free of past mistakes. 
  In order to correctly draw this new Greek policy, it is 
necessary to examine the current development from Skopje's point 
of view. The leaders of the little state may, at this time, 
feel the satisfaction of a victory. But what is this victory 
composed of? It means recognition by the international 
community as a state entity, but with a temporary name. As a 
result, the name chosen by Skopje is still negotiable. Of 
course this rarely happens in world history, but it is not the 
first time. 
  Therefore, Skopje's leaders should know that their victory 
in 
the battle for the name, which they fought for three years, is 
not at all final. However, beyond this battle, which continues, 
Skopje has to fight the real war of its survival as a state 
entity. This war is not won by capitalizing on some 
international coincidences, or by capitalizing on occasional 
diplomatic expediencies. In order to support and reinforce the 
little state's atrophic capabilities, there must be permanent 
and stable props in the nearby geopolitical area to safeguard 
its territorial integrity, overcome the congenital hazards born 
of its racial diversity and create a basic, political, economic 
and social structure that will allow its survival. 
  Mr. Gligorov and those around him know well that only 
Greece, 
in the Balkans, can offer this substantial--not 
typical--"certificate of existence" to Skopje. If they have not 
understood this reality, all the worse for them. 
  Based on these facts, our country, too, should decide its 
future moves. It has nothing to loose by returning to the 
dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations, after Skopje 
accepts the conditions for "restoration of confidence" set by 
the international community. So, let discussion for the overall 
solution of the issue, including the issue of Skopje's name, 
take place at the United Nations. Following de jure recognition 
of its permanent name, Skopje should make sure to secure what 
has been mentioned above and overcome the conditions that make 
its de facto existence uncertain and temporary.

  [Text] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said he will 
come to Athens on Thursday [17 February] in an effort to 
convince Greece to support NATO's threat of bombing raids 
against the Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo. Claes told 
Belgian Television it is sad that Greece has the presidency of 
the European Union [EU], which is in danger of losing its 
credibility if our country is not convinced to give priority to 
the Yugoslav crisis during its term. 
  Replying to the Belgian foreign minister's statement, Greek 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas stressed that 
Greece has given top priority in its EU presidency to settling 
the Yugoslav crisis. And added: The Greek position is that 
issuing ultimatums to the involved parties in Sarajevo is not 
necessary and entails dangers of the spread of the crisis. This 
position is well-founded and we believe it will be justified by 
developments.

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "The `Fatal Mistake'"] </F>
  [Text] First indications are that the threat for the "big 
evil," the bombing massacre, is gaining ground and bringing 
opposing factions in Bosnia-Herzegovina to their senses. 
  And it should bring them to their senses, to avoid the 
destruction and slaughter of the powderkeg Balkans, which will 
lead to a tragic stalemate. 
  Intervention in a civil war in the form of an air raid or 
any 
other force is irrational and leads nowhere. In a civil war, 
you cannot point to the aggressor. A civil war is mutual 
slaughter without mercy. 
  The air raid opens dangerous roads and, leads to the extreme 
and the almost certain engagement of other forces. 
  The engagement of other forces is not impossible, as there 
is 
only one superpower and also other powers with incredible arms 
reserves, even though they may be economically weak. 
  The threat of the "fatal mistake" is palpable. The "fatal 
mistake" of the anachronistic thinking of colonial 
interventions, which also helps the military industry, prevails. 
  The international community today cannot withstand the 
dramatic cost of the "fatal mistake." In terms of human lives 
and irreversible damage, the cost would be huge. 
  Humanity has learned the irrationality and consequences of 
civil war in Vietnam and recently in Somalia, where the 
"peaceful initiative" with military means did not bring any 
result. 
  The countdown in the threat for the "big evil" has begun. At 
the same time, all efforts for an agreement should "run" 
together, so that in the Balkans we do not have another Vietnam, 
prolonged bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto by </F>
correspondent Jarrko Juselius; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] In Finland's opinion, threatening the Serbs 
besieging Sarajevo with air strikes is justified in order to 
prevent genocide. However, it is more difficult to decide on 
actual air strikes, says Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto. 
  [Haavisto] In my opinion, the genocide that has been taking 
place around Sarajevo ought to be brought to an end somehow, and 
if this threat is able to end this genocide and as I have 
understood, at least the Serbs are saying that they will then 
move their heavy weapons from the surroundings of the city, then 
that aim has been achieved. 
  [Juselius] In other words, Finland supports in principle 
this 
kind of policy? 
  [Haavisto] Well, in my opinion there must at least be a 
threat of this kind because the European states must have some 
possibility of preventing genocide of this kind. 
  [Juselius] So you are in practice supporting this threat? 
  [Haavisto] I think the threat is justified, but an actual 
strike is considerably harder in practice because there are, 
after all, these UN troops and people doing humanitarian work 
there so it is far more difficult. 
  [Juselius] So Finland will have to formulate its stance 
again 
in the event that arms are actually resorted to? 
  [Haavisto] We will have to see what happens, but I already 
noted that this threat seems to be quite sufficient.

<F P=106> [Article by Johanna Garam: "Membership Hinges on the Money </F>
Flow"] 
  [Text] The European Union [EU] is Russia's most important 
trading partner. The EU's trade with Russia is about 4 percent 
of the Union's total foreign trade. In other words, the EU is 
very important to Russia, and Russia, of course, is very 
important to Finland. A trade agreement between the EU and 
Russia has yet to be completed but, when signed, it will offer 
future advantages to EU members and, especially, better 
conditions for financing trade. These benefits will also be 
available to Finland if and when it joins the EU. 
  The enormous requirements of Russia and the CIS countries 
call for projects and funds exceeding the resources of Finland 
and Finnish enterprises. The future of Finland's eastern trade 
depends on international financing and access to international 
support programs. 
<H5>  Cooperation and Partnership Does Not Lead to Free Trade </H5>
  The EU and Russia have been negotiating a cooperation and 
partnership agreement since November 1992. Problems like 
aluminum and the scope of activities of foreign banks have 
delayed its conclusion. 
  This agreement will not implement free trade between the EU 
and Russia, but discussions concerning the abolition of customs 
duties are on the agenda for 1998. 
  This cooperation and partnership is not intended to bring 
about Russian membership in the EU. 
  The EU is negotiating similar agreements with the CIS 
countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. 
  Finland has a simple GATT-based trade agreement with Russia. 
Finland could expand its current share of trade with Russia via 
the EU. This would offer clear advantages in terms of 
protection against market interferences such as dumping and 
quotas. The EU also has access to forceful methods like 
boycotts. 
<H5>  Political Conditions Arouse No Interest </H5>
  Unlike the EU cooperation and partnership model, the Finnish 
trade agreement does not include political fringe conditions 
related to continued democratization in Russia. 
  Finns are not particularly enthusiastic about features of 
that sort, since Finland has traded and wants to go on trading 
with Russia regardless of the situation in the country. 
<H5>  Finland's Eastern Trade in Full Expansion </H5>
  "Finland is in the forefront of commercial relations with 
Russia and the Baltic states." Tapio Vilkama of TT [expansion 
unknown] points out that, for instance in the area of new joint 
ventures, only Germany and the United States are ahead. 
  "Talk about Finland missing the train to the east is 
unfounded," Vilkama adds. 
<H5>  Complexities Must Be Sorted Out Before Membership </H5>
  A recent problem is the compulsory special-product 
certificate for all consumer goods. Only a certificate issued 
in Berlin or Switzerland is accepted, the fee for each shipment 
is 250 Finnish markkas [FMk], and there is a FMk5,000 charge for 
annual visits by experts to companies. That is why some 60 
trailer-truck shipments were returned to Finland last fall. 
  Vilkama points out that the problems must be resolved by 
means of a bilateral agreement before Finland joins the EU. 
This would ensure that certificates issued by the Finnish 
Standards Federation have the same validity as foreign ones. 
Metal, food, and manufacturing industries -- especially 
electric and electronic industries -- are the busy sectors in 
trade with Russia. Contracting is another active area, and the 
construction material and furniture industries have regained the 
trading levels of the peak years in the early eighties. 
  Finland's participation as a member of the EU in the Union's 
cooperation and partnership program would create better 
uniformity in trading procedures for Finnish companies. Only 
then could Finland fully benefit from its Eastern trade know-how 
that has been fully recognized in Brussels. 
  Access to development projects will become possible via 
Brussels. The EU conducts an extensive program for East Europe 
and the Baltic states. This program (PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary]) with funds worth 1.4 
billion ECU [European Currency Unit] is designed to assist 
countries of East Europe on their road to democracy and a market 
economy. TACIS [Technical Assistance Program to the CIS] with a 
budget of 510 million ECU is a development program for Russia 
and the CIS countries. But East Europe occupies a more central 
position in Brussels' eyes. 
  These development programs are internal to the EU. Early 
information about projects and the opportunity to take part in 
their early planning stages is important. This includes the 
definition of technical standards, which are vital for 
commercial suppliers investing in such things as energy 
projects. Otherwise there is a risk that these standards will 
be set by large multinational companies, thus finishing off the 
chances of smaller Finnish enterprises. 
  EU membership would open information channels for Finnish 
enterprises about these development programs. Training in the 
use of these opportunities has been launched. We are mentally 
prepared, assures Nina Vaskulahti of the Foreign Ministry. She 
has worked at PHARE and is familiar with the methods of that 
organization. 
<H5>  Finland Must Get to the Sources of the Funds </H5>
  The Finnish list of support projects and development funds 
for Russia, the Baltic states, and East Europe is long and 
diversified. The Finnish support program for East Europe 
includes FMk3.3 billion worth of grants and loans with a state 
guarantee. The volume of loans for bilateral projects with the 
Baltic states, namely FMk818 million, is the highest in the 
world. 
  The action program for the neighboring Russian regions -- 
Murmansk, Karelia, St. Petersburg, and the Leningrad district -- 
has a FMk300 million budget for technical assistance and grain 
deliveries worth in total about FMk250 million. Thousands of 
people have participated in programs offering training, 
consultancy, and the development of administrative systems. 
  The total Finnish assistance package, including loans and 
support, is worth approximately FMk5 billion. 
  Finland is a member of the EBRD [European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development], but the bank's rules are rigid 
and bureaucratic. The projects financed by the institution are 
very large by Finnish standards: The EBRD loan sector is worth 
at least ECU5 million, with a shareholder participation of 25 to 
30 percent of the total project value. The EBRD has invested in 
more than 100 East European projects, but there is no Finnish 
management participation in any of these. It is believed that 
Finnish opportunities via the EBRD will improve when we can 
participate in the study and preparation phases of the projects. 
<H5>  Assistance From EU's Own Bank </H5>
  The EU's own bank, the EIB (European Investment Bank), has 
considerable investment resources. The EIB will become 
accessible to the Finnish business community through membership 
in the EU, although a certain level of cooperation is currently 
being discussed under an agreement with the EFTA [European Free 
Trade Association] countries. 
  The IFC (International Finance Corporation), a subsidiary of 
the World Bank, which is the largest financer of development 
programs, differs from its two host institutions, the IBRD 
[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and the 
IDA [International Development Agency], inasmuch as it also 
finances projects in the private sector. IFC is active in East 
Europe, promoting joint ventures, privatization, legislation, 
capital markets, and foreign investment. Finland has up to now 
been an outsider in terms of the main flow of international 
financing. Trading, even with neighbors, may become difficult 
in the future if we attempt to go it alone.
