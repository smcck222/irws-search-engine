<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN/HUFVUDSTADSBLADET report: "Haavisto in </F>
Copenhagen: EU Lacks Knowledge About Our Circumstances"] 
  [Text] Copenhagen -- Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto used 
strong words to criticize the EU's [European Union] handling of 
the membership negotiations when he visited Copenhagen yesterday 
to receive advice from the Danish Government regarding the 
difficult final phase of negotiations with the EU. 
  Haavisto described the EU's position as a disappointment and 
regretted the fact that the EU negotiators do not have greater 
knowledge of Finland's circumstances. 
  "We are disappointed with the way in which the EU is 
negotiating. There is no united and effective leadership in the 
negotiations. Too many different EU bodies are involved, and 
the Greek presidency is colored by the fact that Greece only 
took over the position at the beginning of the year," Heikki 
Haavisto said in an interview with FINSKA NOTISBYRAN's 
correspondent in Copenhagen. 
  According to Haavisto, the EU negotiators do not know enough 
about conditions in Finland. It is difficult therefore to 
convince them that Finland needs special agricultural and 
regional support. 
  He regretted the tough line that the EU countries adopted on 
Tuesday [8 February] on agricultural and regional policy. 
According to Haavisto, Finland cannot accept the EU's no to 
special and permanent support for Finnish agriculture. 
  However, Haavisto pointed out that the negotiations are 
still 
being conducted chiefly at civil servant level, and that the 12 
EU countries' leaders, who are expected to involve themselves in 
the final phase of negotiations, have all expressed great 
interest that the EU should admit the other current applicant 
nations as members. 
  Yesterday Haavisto was on a one-day visit to Copenhagen to 
discuss the Finnish position in the EU negotiations with Danish 
Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen and Danish Agriculture 
Minister Bjorn Westh. Haavisto described the meetings as 
"extremely positive." 
  The two foreign ministers also discussed relations with 
Russia, the Baltic region, and NATO's so-called Partnership for 
Peace. According to Haavisto, Finland and Denmark have largely 
concordant views on these questions. 
  Yesterday, Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen was much 
more restrained in his comments on the situation in the EU 
negotiations than was Foreign Minister Haavisto. Salolainen 
stressed that the real negotiations are only just beginning -- 
so far it has chiefly been a case of an exchange of positions. 
Decisions will not be arrived at before the decisive political 
negotiations at the end of this month. 
  The negotiations will be conducted at ministerial level on 
21-22 February and again on 25-28 February. On 25 February the 
Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish prime ministers will meet in 
Helsinki to ponder the situation prior to the decisive bout of 
arm wrestling. 
  However, Salolainen also regretted the fact that the 
political goodwill that the Finnish side has been able to note 
in recent high-level political contacts has still failed to find 
an expression in the positions the EU has adopted in the 
negotiations proper. He expects that both sides will be forced 
to display "wise flexibility" in the decisive phase of the 
negotiations. It will be impossible to have the Finnish demands 
accepted 100 percent, but there have to be better offers from 
the EU if there is to be an acceptable result from the 
negotiations.

  [Text] Norway supports the NATO decision to use air strikes 
in Bosnia if necessary, said Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal, 
but the NATO decision met with opposing views in the Norwegian 
parliament. Defense Minister Joergen Kosmo confirmed, however, 
that Norway is prepared to participate if NATO takes military 
action in Bosnia. Defense Minister Kosmo said also that a plan 
has been made to evacuate the Norwegian UN force in Bosnia, 
should this become necessary.

<F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "Knudsen Put Norway's Case in Song"] </F>
  [Text] London -- With the sounds of "Vestland, Vestland" 
new Trade Minister Grete Knudsen put Norway's case in song in 
London. 
  "It was a little bit exciting," Grete Knudsen said after 
paying her maiden visit abroad in the EU [European Union] 
context. She sang her song in the dignified rooms of the 
British Foreign Office when she met her counterpart, European 
Affairs Minister David Heathcoat-Amory, for talks yesterday. 
  "I was very frightened," she had to admit afterward. But 
encouraged by the extremely positive tone she encountered 
vis-a-vis Norway's negotiations with the EU and from the 
minister himself, she kept her courage. There is no indication 
of how the otherwise so formal British took this Norwegian song. 
But Whitehall is still standing. 
  With Grete Knudsen in the international arena in the context 
of the EU, things have come full circle for the Bergen 
politician who, in the past, was in opposition in many areas to 
parts of the Labor Party system. 
  Knudsen headed the Labor Party inquiry into Europe that led 
to the party's decision to submit an application for membership. 
And now the former "no to the EC" politician has thrown herself 
completely into the battle for an agreement, and by her own 
admission even with some degree of enthusiasm: 
  "I expect that we will pull it off. Both the British and the 
Norwegian sides are putting their efforts into an agreement 
before March," she said at a news conference. There was no 
discussion of any scenario for what will happen if Norway falls 
behind in the negotiations. 
  According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, the EU position 
paper 
on fisheries will not be ready before the end of this month. 
Spanish demands for access to the available resources are 
creating internal problems within the EU. 
  Grete Knudsen left London yesterday in the knowledge that 
the 
British are warm supporters of Norwegian EU membership. But the 
question is whether all the positive vibes can be transformed 
into concrete action and movement on the difficult points in the 
negotiations. In the field of regional policy, Norway has run 
into difficulties about having all of northern Norway included 
in the Objective 1 category of the EU's regional support system. 
It was thought until recently that this issue was as good as 
solved, but Trade Minister Knudsen was told yesterday that the 
British side also fears a contagious effect within the EU if 
people are too kind about the support criteria. 
  As far as agricultural policy is concerned, Britain has in 
the past had the greatest sympathy with Norway's demands for a 
gradual transition to the EU prices for agricultural products, 
but has given way inside the EU to the demand for EU prices on 
foodstuffs from day one. But the signal from Britain now is 
that it still has sympathy with the Norwegian demands and that 
it is paving the way for flexibility in the negotiations. 
  The question has been raised in negotiating circles about 
whether the new trade minister in the final phase of the 
negotiations is mentally prepared to give way on some points in 
order to win on others: 
  "I will not swap things for other things. We could end up in 
situation where we have to allocate priorities, and this is 
exactly what it is all about," Grete Knudsen said.

<F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "Spanish Ultimatum on Norwegian Fish"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- "Everything is negotiable and this 
includes Spain's demand for quotas in Norwegian waters in the 
context of Norway's wish to become a member of the EU [European 
Union]. But if Norway continues to insist on its completely 
impossible position that it does not have a single fish to give 
away, it will be Norway and not Spain that is blocking the way 
for membership," European Affairs Minister Carlos Westendorp 
told AFTENPOSTEN. 
  In the midst of yesterday's busy round of negotiations 
between the EU and the four applicant nations, AFTENPOSTEN was 
granted an exclusive meeting with an extremely relaxed European 
affairs minister and his closest aides, Franscisco Elorza and 
Alberto Navarro. This troika is currently firmly pushing large 
numbers of Spanish demands in the negotiations with the 
applicant nations. They are doing so in what seems to be such an 
uncompromising manner that many observers in Brussels are 
shaking their heads in resignation and wondering how it is to be 
at all possible to reach a solution that both the applicants and 
Spain can accept. 
  However, this practiced Spanish negotiating trio -- long 
since pointed to in Norway as the archenemy -- gave the 
appearance of being friendliness itself. With one voice and 
with a sparkle in the eye, they assured me that they want Norway 
as a member of the EU, and they insisted on being believed when 
they claimed that they are willing to negotiate everything. But 
in the negotiations both sides must make some concessions, and 
so far they have not seen a single signal of a Norwegian 
determination to negotiate, they said. 
  "No Norwegian EU membership without fish for Spain," 
Francisco Elorza said determinedly. He claimed that he has 
already been in contact with Norway to signal a clear and 
unambiguous willingness to negotiate, but threw his hands up in 
a gesture of resignation at what he views as Norwegian 
implacability. But does Spain really dare block Norwegian 
membership, if Norway stands up for itself? 
  "We are convinced that we do not need to block membership. 
Look what happened during the EEA [European Economic Area] 
negotiations. Eventually the EU won some fish from Norway. 
Spain had to share this with others. This time we want our own 
quota from Norway. If it was possible to reach agreement during 
the EEA negotiations, why not this time too?" Westendorp asked. 
  The Spanish European affairs minister compared Norway and 
Spain to two trains that are approaching each other at full 
speed, but that still have time to apply their brakes to prevent 
a collision. "I do not think that there will be a collision," 
Westendorp said. He does not rule out the possibility that 
Spain will be put under great pressure from the other EU 
countries to abandon its demands. 
  "We could become isolated in the EU, but remember that 
unanimity is needed to reach a joint position vis-a-vis Norway," 
he stressed. Westendorp added for safety's sake that the demand 
for Norwegian quotas is the only Spanish demand in the fisheries 
field. "Norway also refuses to allow foreign investment in its 
fishing fleet. This goes completely against the EU's 
regulations, so here Norway will have to give in," he said. 
  On the other hand Spain has no problems with allowing Norway 
full duty-free market access for fish and fish products from day 
one of membership of the EU, Elorza said. Nor has he heard that 
any other EU countries will oppose this, but does not rule out 
the possibility that such demands could surface. 
  The difficult topic of yesterday's negotiations with the 
applicant countries was first and foremost the applicants' 
demand that parts of their territory should be included among 
so-called Objective 1 regions and be allocated funds from the 
EU's structural fund. The EU's formal requirement is that the 
average income in such regions must not be more than 75 percent 
of the EU average. The Commission has proposed that the four 
northernmost Norwegian provinces be entitled to support under 
this criterion. 
  Spain takes a very different view and claims that there can 
be no suggestion of agreeing to allowing Finnish Lapland and 
Norway's four northernmost provinces to receive support under 
Objective 1. Francisco Elorza made it crystal clear that Spain 
does not intend to allow Objective 1 to "be polluted," as he put 
it. "These Norwegian provinces do not meet the requirements." 
  "But you people in Norway will receive financial support 
nevertheless," he said, smiling. "The point is that this 
support must be financed via other areas of the EU budget, and 
must be called something else. Call it a special program or 
something like that," he suggested. 
  "We in Spain understand extremely well that you have 
problems 
in your regions, and we want you to receive money. In the years 
leading up to 1999 we must find a way to reach a transitional 
solution. After that, you will be treated in line with other EU 
countries," he stressed several times. His unspoken point is 
that Spain is such a major recipient of EU support under 
Objective 1 that the country does not want new members to help 
themselves to money from this particular fund. 
  "Remember that here too unanimity is also needed in the EU 
if 
a joint position is to be reached," he said meaningfully. On 
the subject of Norway's demand that it be allowed not to have to 
adjust agricultural prices from the first day, he said that this 
is something Spain can understand very well. "Here we will 
agree to a transitional arrangement. But do not forget one 
thing: As far as fruit and vegetables are concerned, Spain is 
demanding full duty-free access to Norway from day one of 
membership."

  [Excerpt] Now we turn to Swedish reaction to the latest 
events concerning Bosnia. Prime Minister Carl Bildt advocates a 
careful line in Bosnia, and he still hopes that negotiations 
will cause the NATO threat not to be carried out; but Carl Bildt 
is of the opinion that the decision was necessary. 
  [Begin recording] [Bildt] I think stronger military pressure 
is necessary on both sides. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is it credible? 
  [Bildt] I think it is credible. It is clear through those 
partial successes in the negotiations during the last 24 hours 
that it is perceived as credible. 
  [Correspondent] The fact that Russia might not approve a 
NATO 
decision which has not been sanctioned beforehand in the UN 
Security Council -- is this something to be taken into account? 
  [Bildt] Yes, this shows the tension regarding this question 
between the different countries in the Security Council, but 
NATO has now acted after consulting the UN secretary general, 
who referred to Security Council resolutions within the 
framework of which he considers that he is acting; and Russia 
was there. [sentence as heard] 
  [Correspondent] There are many both open and veiled threats 
from Russia on an escalation of the conflict. Do you think it 
could spread outside Bosnia? 
  [Bildt] Yes, and that is why I have been slightly skeptical 
regarding suggestions in the Swedish debate -- I should express 
myself carefully -- suggestions that have meant that we should 
take part in a considerable expansion of the conflict. I think 
it is essential to have these dangers clear in one's mind. 
Thus, to work for a political solution is no excuse in itself 
to start on further violence. [end recording] 
  The person who wants to have harder measures, to which Carl 
Bildt referred, is Pierre Schori, the Social Democratic foreign 
policy spokesman. He is of the opinion that NATO could act now 
with the mandate from the United Nations, and should do so if 
the conditions are not met. 
  [Begin recording] [Schori] It seems that they are serious 
this time, and it would be terrible if they again gave a warning 
that they did not back up. The reactions of the Serbian army 
also seem to indicate that they take it seriously. 
  [Correspondent] The threats coming from Russia -- is it 
credible when Zhirinovskiy says that this could be the beginning 
of the third world war? Should one take this seriously? 
  [Schori] One can of course do this; one must listen to what 
he says. But what is important now is to take the daily carnage 
in Sarajevo seriously. Politics means to want something, but 
politics also means to choose, and sometimes one must choose 
between terribly difficult and maybe painful decisions, and here 
we must choose between the oppressed and the oppressors, between 
victims and executioners, and we must stand on the side of the 
people in Sarajevo. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "Swedish Ultimatum"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- European Affairs Minister Ulf 
Dinkelspiel is now delivering an ultimatum on regional policy in 
the EU [European Union] negotiations. Without satisfactory 
support for Norrland there will be no agreement and no 
referendum. 
  "Without a satisfactory solution involving a recognition of 
the special problems of Norrland and special support for 
Norrland, there will be no agreement. We would then not have 
anything to vote on." 
  So said Ulf Dinkelspiel yesterday in Brussels after a 
negotiating round in which the EU's ministers had given the 
thumbs-down to Norrbotten. Norrbotten is too rich to qualify 
for the Objective 1 support for the EU's poorest regions, the EU 
ministers declared. 
  "I think that the situation is serious. But it is too early 
to talk about an out-and-out crisis, because we have agreed to 
continue the negotiations," said Ulf Dinkelspiel, who by his own 
admission "thumped the table pretty thoroughly" on the subject 
of regional policy. 
  "They cannot have failed to see that I was in deadly 
earnest," he said. 
  The EU side's message is that Norrbotten has so large a 
gross 
national product, GNP, per inhabitant that Objective 1 support 
is out of the question. Instead it takes the view that Sweden 
could aim for a solution that is based on two other regional 
objective classifications in the EU, the so-called Objective 2 
and Objective 5b classifications. 
  But Sweden's negotiators say no to this. 
  "Objective 2 and Objective 5b are defined as support for 
regions in industrial decline and support for agricultural 
development and this does not properly cover the situation in 
northern Sweden," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. 
  "For example, they do not cover the need for infrastructure 
investments in northern Sweden." 
  At the meeting, the Swedish negotiators argued that northern 
Sweden has special problems that are overlooked by the GNP 
criteria the EU uses in its calculations. It is a question of a 
severe climate, sparse population, and great distances. They 
pointed out, for example, that the region, which receives 
Swedish support, covers an area that is 10 times the size of 
Belgium, but that has a population no bigger than that of the 
Belgian city of Liege. 
  In a diplomatic offensive over the last few weeks, the 
Swedish negotiators have tried to hammer this message home to 
the EU side's negotiators. But if their message has -- in Ulf 
Dinkelspiel's words -- "not fallen wholly on stony ground," it 
has clearly not hit fully home. 
  What Sweden wants is an "Objective 1-like solution" where 
the 
actual label used is not so important. One proposal for such a 
solution, a special Arctic regional fund, has been put forward 
by Germany and Greece, but so far it has been shot down by the 
other EU countries. 
  But the tough stances voiced yesterday are merely the 
initial 
bids in the negotiations on regional policy. What will happen 
in the future remains to be seen. 
  Yesterday's negotiations also touched on agriculture. 
Sweden's negotiators tabled demands that Sweden be allowed to 
continue to give special support to Norrland's farmers and that 
the EU should contribute to this over and above the agricultural 
support to disadvantaged regions already contained in the EU's 
rules. Ulf Dinkelspiel also voiced Sweden's dissatisfaction 
with the proposed milk and sugar quotas which have not yet been 
officially presented to Sweden.

<F P=106> [Article signed RF: "Still No Belgians for Air Strikes"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Brussels -- Defense Minister Leo Delcroix has 
already adopted measures to enhance the safety of the Belgian 
troops in Bosnia. He believes that there is little chance of 
Belgium having to take part in air strikes. 
  In the House of Representatives during question time, Mr. 
Delcroix was grilled on the subject of the safety of Belgian 
troops in the Croatian area of Baranja, and in Central Bosnia, 
following the NATO ultimatum imposed at 1300 on Friday [11 
February]. He stated that "we are 100 percent behind the 
decision made by NATO," but added that "the safety of our troops 
comes first." 
  The minister warned against issuing orders from within one's 
own country to troops who are operationally under the command of 
UN generals Rose and Cot [in Bosnia], "as other countries 
sometimes do." He also denied that plans to withdraw the 
peacekeeping forces and humanitarian aid missions were already 
being considered. 
  The Ministry of Defense, the Army, and UN command were 
already doing their utmost to ensure the safety of the Belgian 
troops, he continued. For instance, the troops were now better 
armed. In the Baranja region, they would henceforth be equipped 
with Milan rockets (that can destroy a tank from a distance of 2 
km), and with armored vehicles. The roughly 750 troops in the 
Baranja area have been concentrated from 12 sites to just five. 
  Minister Delcroix later stated that he had not completely 
ruled out the possibility of Belgium supplying additional troops 
for NATO air strikes at a later stage, but stated that this was 
not the case for the time being. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Belgian Air Force is not equipped to carry out 
precision bombings on Serbian positions in the hills around 
Sarajevo, an army spokesman stated yesterday. "Our F-16's are 
equipped for bombings, but they are not provided with smart 
weapons, i.e. computer-controlled homing missiles, which 
demonstrated their usefulness during the Gulf war," he explained. 
  "Even if other allies would provide our Air Force with this 
sort of high-tech weapons, it would still be impossible, because 
our pilots are not familiar with these weapons." In recent 
years, the Belgian Air Force mainly specialized in 
reconnaissance and defense missions.

<F P=106> [Article by Oscar Garschagen: "Bill Clinton Shows His </F>
Weakest Side"] 
  [Text] U.S. fighter planes were flying over Sarajevo on 
Saturday [5 February] while in the market in the eastern part of 
the city a horrific scene was unfolding. The marine pilots saw 
how the graves were being dug on the football field next to 
Kosevo hospital. And then they flew back to base, without being 
able to fire a single shot. 
  America could see, mainly through ABC, how the Bosnia policy 
of President Clinton, the European Union, NATO, and the United 
Nations was once again being reduced to nothing at all. The 
dramatic television pictures produced an immediate effect, in 
the form of meetings between the President and his foreign 
policy advisers. Throughout the weekend anxious looking 
ministers and CIA bosses shuttled back and forth to the White 
House. But the collective handwringing remained without result 
in Washington and Brussels on Monday. 
  The absurdity level of these meetings was further emphasized 
by an anonymous Pentagon military official who told CNN that if 
U.S. pilots in Italy were given the order they could destroy 
Serbian positions around Sarajevo within an hour. But instead 
of this the world was treated to new declarations on ending the 
siege of Sarajevo "with all possible means, including air 
strikes." Powerful but familiar words. 
  President Clinton in particular revealed an unexpectedly 
weak 
side last weekend. Following the latest meeting of NATO 
government leaders, in mid-January, Clinton gave the impression 
that new attacks on the so-called safe areas -- including 
Sarajevo -- would be met with harsh measures. 
  But now at the first sign of aggression the President is 
balking -- or at least this is the impression he is giving. He 
has called for an enquiry to find out who carried out the 
attack. According to UN soldiers on the spot it is impossible 
to precisely determine the mortar's line of fire, but it is 
certain that it was fired from a position to the northeast of 
Sarajevo, from a Serbian position. 
  The reason for Clinton's hesitant approach is clear. 
Divisions within the alliance -- with Great Britain and Canada 
exerting great pressure for restraint -- and divisions within 
the U.S. Government --- the State Department versus the Defense 
Department -- are the major causes. 
  At the White House the belief took root some time ago now 
that active intervention by Clinton in Bosnia could be very 
dangerous for his domestic agenda, as the American people would 
not support him in such a policy. Clinton's power base in the 
United States and in Congress is too small to embark upon any 
foreign adventures, the argument goes. 
  Given his slim electoral victory in 1992 and the balance of 
power in Congress, there are indeed arguments to support this 
analysis. The call for strong action by Congress comes mainly 
from a handful of Republicans and a few Democrats -- such as Lee 
Hamilton, president of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Together 
with a few vociferous columnists in THE NEW YORK TIMES, they are 
arguing for the United States to play a bigger role. 
  This call -- which is being voiced increasing loudly -- has 
found little support among large groups of Republicans and 
Democrats from the south, mid-west and west of the country. 
Memories of previous wars -- Vietnam -- and recent military 
actions -- Somalia -- are still too fresh. And Clinton is a 
political animal who is acutely aware of prevailing opinions. 
  Although no American lives are threatened in Bosnia, peace 
and stability in Europe are an American interest too. And 
violations of human rights are an affront to American values. 
  What he can be accused of is having done so little to shift 
opinion and to assume the leadership of the international 
community. In public -- and as far as we know also behind the 
scenes -- he has done nothing to put an end to the national and 
international divisions. 
  It is true that the Europeans have -- regretfully -- been 
found wanting, but the United States has subsequently done 
little to correct their errors. The only strong stance taken by 
Clinton concerned the lifting of the arms embargo so that the 
Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves. The attack on the 
Saturday market in Sarajevo has deprived opponents of lifting 
this arms embargo of any good arguments. If the Bosnians are 
not helped by the West then they certainly have the right to 
defend themselves. 
  The basic error is that right from the outset the Europeans 
have presented Bosnia as a humanitarian problem and not also as 
the victim of a military campaign of conquest by the Serbs and 
Croats. If a UN enquiry shows that the Serbs launched the mortar 
grenade then military air strikes will be unavoidable. 
  These must be accompanied by the lifting of the arms embargo 
to allow the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves against the 
advancing Serbs and Croats. The argument that arms supplies 
will only prolong the fighting also lost its force last 
Saturday. What use have the Bosnian Muslims of food parcels if 
they are then going to be slaughtered on the marketplace? When 
Winston Churchill asked President Roosevelt for weapons and 
equipment in December 1940, Roosevelt -- who did indeed show 
leadership -- did not reply with the argument that it would 
simply prolong the Second World War.

<F P=106> [Pierre Lefevre commentary: "The Choice for Unity and Risks"] </F>
  [Text] It seems that Europeans and Americans have finally 
overcome their main disagreements on the Bosnian problem. A 
significant change has taken place in the main Western 
countries, due certainly to last Saturday's [5 February] 
massacre in Sarajevo, but also to the increasing realization 
that the diplomatic and humanitarian effort has so far been 
ineffective. This ineffectiveness has led more than one to 
consider purely and simply withdrawing the UN troops in shame. 
  No matter what developments we will see in the coming days, 
it is now clear that the Western world, under Franco-U.S. 
leadership, has not opted for an immediate withdrawal from the 
Bosnian theatre, but on the contrary decided to take risks there. 
  The White House, which has tried to ignore the problem as 
long as possible, has apparently come to the conclusion that the 
political price of inaction could finally be higher than that of 
limited engagement. Public opinion and Congress are indeed 
starting to rouse themselves and ask questions about the 
abilities and leadership of President Clinton. 
  The U.S. decision is a double one. On the one hand it 
concerns an operation with military implications to free 
Sarajevo from its murderous stranglehold. On the other hand it 
concerns the involvement of the United States in the peace 
process. For some time the Europeans have considered U.S. 
involvement of this kind in the negotiations indispensable, both 
to impress the Serbs and reassure the Muslims, who do not 
believe in a peace without U.S. guarantees. 
  This additional pressure from Washington is especially 
important, at a time when the new Muslim offensive could lead to 
new formidable developments in the war. 
  But not everything has been settled. Certainly unprecedented 
pressure is being put on the warring parties, and as soon as it 
is operational, the model adopted for Sarajevo could soon be 
applied to Tuzla and other safe areas defined by the United 
Nations. But it is not certain that the Serbs will yield. They 
could play the game of resistance, reprisals, escalation and 
cause the situation to become blocked. Then the question could 
be raised soon of the solidity of the U.S. commitment. The 
Somali and Haitian examples have showed the very relative 
determination of the current administration in this type of 
conflict. 
  It also remains to be seen if the Europeans and Americans 
will agree on the nature of the peace plan to be proposed to the 
three warring parties. The European Union says it is ready to 
amend its plan, but it is known that Washington is very reticent 
regarding a carve-up which it considers as rewarding aggression. 
  Finally there is the Russian problem. Moscow opposes air 
strikes against the Serbs and more generally against any NATO 
intervention in this region that falls within its former sphere 
of influence. Russia in contrast could be a useful if not 
indispensable ally in reaching a peace agreement. The Europeans 
have shown their wish to gain its partnership, and Washington 
has just sent an envoy there but, with the current rise in 
ultranationalism and Pan-Slavism, it is certainly not the 
easiest aspect of the issue to deal with.

<F P=106> [Carl Pansaerts commentary: "Deja Vu"] </F>
  [Text] The Bosnian Serbs are withdrawing their heavy 
weapons from the hills around Sarajevo and are concluding a 
cease-fire with the Muslim defenders of the Bosnian capital. In 
Brussels, NATO is looking into the issue of air strikes against 
Serbian positions in the hills around Sarajevo. As these 
reports flooded into the news room it was hard to suppress a 
feeling of "deja vu." 
  Exactly six months ago yesterday, on 9 August 1993, the 16 
ambassadors to the North Atlantic Treaty Association (NATO) sat 
around a table to talk about possible military action against 
the Serbs besieging Sarajevo. 
  There are two reasons why a real ultimatum was never issued. 
First, internal disagreement in NATO, namely resistance from the 
French, meant that action was impossible. Second, at the 
eleventh hour the Serbs resolved to pull out of Mount Igman and 
Mount Bjelasnica from where they had their guns trained on 
Sarajevo. 
  And so history repeats itself, more or less. Yesterday the 
NATO ambassadors were debating once again possible air strikes, 
and once again the summit was not immediately a picture of 
unanimity. However, this time NATO did manage to issue a clear 
ultimatum. 
  The Serbs, with the international community breathing down 
their necks, yesterday sought, just as they had last year, to 
quickly pour oil on troubled waters by demonstrating their 
willingness to withdraw their heavy artillery and by signing a 
hasty cease-fire with the Muslim Forces defending Sarajevo. 
  The question now is whether the West will again let itself 
be 
wrapped up in a series of empty Serbian promises. After all, in 
August of last year Serbian Leader Radovan Karadzic promised a 
stage-by-stage handover of the hills to the United Nations. 
Half a year later they are still encamped in the hills and are 
responsible for daily deaths on the streets of Sarajevo. 
  NATO is now asking the Serbs to stick to their promises. 
They must tie the Serbian proposals to a concrete deadline -- 
preferably as short as possible -- and make it crystal clear to 
the Serbs what the military sanctions will be should they break 
their promises. 
  An ultimatum can help in this, but it must not be the 
umpteenth deadline that passes with no action being taken. That 
would be a fatal blow for the credibility of NATO and the 
international community. NATO must be prepared to accept the 
military consequences of its ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs. 
  Separate from the issue of the military rights and wrongs of 
air strikes, there is no getting away from the fact that NATO's 
tougher stance has come extremely late in the day. The war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is, after all, precisely two years old. If, 
in the spring of 1992, NATO, the United Nations, and the 
European Union had bared their teeth and made it clear that they 
were serious, then maybe the conflict in Bosnia would not have 
escalated to the point it has today. After all, NATO's action 
is now restricted merely to dousing the flames instead of 
preventing the fire.

<F P=106> [Pierre Lefevre commentary: "NATO's Message"] </F>
  [Text] The ultimatum which NATO has just sent the Bosnian 
Serbs has wider implications than appears at first. Its main 
aim is certainly to rapidly free Sarajevo from its mortal 
stranglehold. From now on, the person carrying out a new blind 
shot against a civil target in the Bosnian capital has been 
warned that he is exposing himself to immediate punishment. And 
in 10 days the main part of the threat should have disappeared. 
In this respect it can only be regretted that this decision 
came so late and that last Saturday's [5 February] horrible 
massacre was necessary for it to be taken. 
  This ultimatum means that the international community has 
found a burst of new energy, just as it was starting to become 
tired of its impotence in the Yugoslav conflict and was ready to 
let go. With this regained will and firmness, this community 
can start to regain some credibility. In this respect too, it 
was high time. 
  The determined NATO intervention could also mark a turning 
point in the Bosnian crisis. "Sarajevo first of all," the 
French foreign minister said, indicating that there is no 
question of renouncing the demands of the other besieged 
enclaves. If it bears fruit, the therapy applied to the Bosnian 
capital could also be extended to Tuzla and Srebenica, and 
tomorrow to Mostar or the other towns and regions where the 
warring parties, be they Serbs, Croats or Muslims, are attacking 
civilians. For the rest it is hard to imagine that with one of 
the sides having been brought back to its senses, another could 
carry out the same exactions with impunity. 
  The Atlantic Alliance is now applying a strategy of 
dissuasion- persuasion. It does not want to carry out air 
strikes or increase the level of violence. On the contrary its 
aim is to avoid them and to exercise military pressure so that 
negotiations lead to the demilitarization of Sarajevo, then its 
administration by the United Nations, the first step in the 
realization of the peace plan proposed by the Europeans. This 
could be the start of a new dynamic. 
  The threat of reprisals could certainly cause a hostile 
reaction from the Serbs and lead them into a build-up of 
violence. However, they know that the relationship of forces is 
less favorable to them at present and that by engaging 
themselves against far more sophisticated technology they would 
risk losing their heavy weapons, which are one of their main 
advantages. There is no doubt that they will think twice before 
exposing themselves to Western aviation. By forcing NATO to 
attack them, they would also remind the world that they are the 
main aggressors in this conflict which they have virtually won. 
  Russia too is raising its voice, but the message also 
applies 
to it. In reality the authors of the ultimatum attach little 
importance to its protests, but are inviting it to join the 
peace efforts and put maximum pressure on its Serbian allies so 
that they will hear reason. NATO's decision is also, in this 
respect, a sort of answer to Moscow's neo-imperialist 
temptations, telling it that there is no place for a return of 
its influence on its former satellites, and that it must make a 
choice between cooperation or exclusion. 
  Finally the Europeans and Americans have rediscovered the 
virtues and effectiveness of cooperation. Just as the United 
Nations and NATO have found a new articulation and 
complementariness. The lesson is for the West itself, which has 
displayed its divisions during the 22 months of the Bosnian 
conflict. Even if NATO's reaction is late, it means that there 
is a politically operational guarantee of stability in Europe in 
the uncertain period following the end of the Cold War. Those 
who could have thought that anything was allowed in Europe now 
know that there is a limit to the infamy.

<F P=106> [Mia Doornaert commentary: "Heavy NATO Artillery"] </F>
  [Text] The unknown person who fired off the murderous shell 
at Sarajevo on Saturday [5 February] has contributed to the 
first credible stand now being taken against the aggressors in 
Bosnia. The wave of outrage about the bloodbath put political 
leaders under pressure. Foreign Minister Willy Claes also 
appeared to have suddenly been won over in favor of air strikes. 
  But it is not so that it was just a wave of emotion which 
brought NATO to a decision which means that the Alliance could 
make its first armed intervention in the 44 years of its 
existence. 
  The ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw in 10 days 
from the area surrounding Sarajevo and the threat of immediate 
air strikes if they again shell the Bosnian capital came under 
Franco-U.S. leadership. It was realized in the framework of a 
joint diplomatic approach which had been ripening for some time. 
  It is clear that the patience is running out of the 
countries 
which are making the main contribution to the UN peacekeeping 
force in the former Yugoslavia, particularly France and the 
United Kingdom. The perspective that new offensives were likely 
in Bosnia after the winter also led to a more muscular approach 
which is intended to put new force behind a political agreement. 
  The combative profile of the new UN commanders in Bosnia and 
the NATO decision both indicate that from now on the aggressors 
will be able to go about their business with less impunity. 
  The increased military pressure, which received the blessing 
of UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, is intended to 
bring a political solution closer. The United States and the 
European partners are now on the same wavelength about the 
solution. 
  The European countries do not want the pressure on the Serbs 
to encourage the Muslims to try to win back with weapons what 
they have not received at the negotiating table. 
  The United States, which up to now was very critical of the 
proposed territorial division, is now ready to also put pressure 
on the Muslims. "If you are not ready to deploy troops, then 
you must not delude the Muslims that they have any interest in 
continuing a war where our UN troops are involved," was roughly 
the tenor of the French arguments which won over Washington. 
  Therefore now the Serbs are under pressure from the NATO 
threat, while the Muslims have been warned that they cannot 
continue to count on the presence of UN troops if they do not 
give in. 
  The NATO decision, which fits in with efforts to reach a 
quick political agreement, also involves many risks. If air 
strikes should be carried out, and/or there are Serbian 
reprisals against UN troops, then the political leaders must not 
suddenly change course when faced with new emotional reactions 
in their public opinion. 
  In addition, the opening up and protection of Sarajevo is 
still a long way from achieving peace in Bosnia. It will 
require concerted, determined diplomacy in the coming months to 
achieve a workable agreement in Bosnia. If Russia starts to act 
disruptively in the Security Council then it will be even more 
difficult. 
  And afterwards a UN peacekeeping force will be necessary in 
Bosnia for some time to monitor the implementation of the 
agreement. So it is not to be hoped that even in that optimistic 
scenario, the UN peacekeeping mission can wave farewell to 
Bosnia once the hard winter months are past. 
  Then there is still the question of whether it is not high 
time, in order to ensure that NATO and the UN's "heavy 
artillery" have the best chances of success, to change the 
international negotiators. Particularly Lord Owen, who has 
already made so many zigzags. Now he has bitterly little credit 
and authority, which does not aid the peace process.

<F P=106> [Article signed V.K.: "New Government Team in Burundi"] </F>
  [Text] Faced with the continuing explosive situation in the 
country, new Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira -- who was 
sworn in last Saturday [5 February] -- and his prime minister, 
Anatole Kanyenkiko, have rapidly formed their new government 
which was announced on Wednesday evening. Including 27 
ministers (compared with 22 in the previous government), 60 
percent of them are drawn from the Frobedu [Burundi Democratic 
Front], the president's party. The remaining 40 percent come 
from the opposition, principally the Uprona [Unity for National 
Progress] and a newcomer, the new Liberal Party. This formula 
had already been adopted by the late President Ndadaye. 
  Jean Ngendanganya, Burundian ambassador in Brussels, 
welcomed 
this re-establishment of democratic institutions and appealed to 
public opinion, friendly governments, and non-governmental 
organizations to help the new government team to rebuild the 
country, deeply marked by recent events. "We have 800,000 
refugees to be repatriated, and just as many displaced persons 
who we must help to return to their homes," he stated, adding 
that -- for greater efficiency -- this government "is mainly 
composed of technicians. These qualities took precedence in 
selecting the future ministers, more than their position in the 
party hierarchy. It is also clear that the services of those who 
took part in the attacks were not retained."

<F P=106> [Marie-France Cros report: "An Anti-Belgian Campaign"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Belgium is currently the target of a campaign of 
denigration in Rwanda. How has this happened? 
  Our country supplies half of the contingent of Blue Helmets 
currently in Rwanda to help the implementation of the Arusha 
peace plan. However, the document does not please everybody and 
particularly not the supporters of the National Republican 
Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND), the former single 
party. Indeed, the latter have never completely abandoned their 
conviction that the best possible outcome to the war started in 
1990 by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) guerrillas was a 
military victory which the government army had failed to secure. 
Thus any compromise required by the peace negotiations is seen, 
in these conservative ranks, as a concession to the enemy. 
<H5>  Human Rights </H5>
  For instance, the conservatives do not like Brussels' 
insistence on reaffirming the duty to respect human rights, 
although these reminders have concerned all sides in the 
conflict. 
  Similarly, they have often criticized Belgium for having 
withdrawn after one month the soldiers sent at the beginning of 
the war to ensure the evacuation of our fellow citizens who 
wanted to leave the country in October 1990, unlike the French 
who left their men until the Blue Helmets arrived last December. 
The French presence made it easier for the Rwandan Government 
Army to withstand the thrust of the FPR which, without that, 
"diplomatic circles say," would have reached Kigali by force of 
arms. 
<H5>  Bitterness </H5>
  It is easy to see the bitterness which this inability to 
ensure a military victory for their ideas is creating in many 
MRND supporters for whom the FPR is synonymous with Tutsis which 
is synonymous with monarchy. 
  It must be remembered that the FPR was created by Tutsi (the 
minority ethnic group) exiles in Uganda, although it now has in 
its ranks an unspecified number of Hutus, like its President 
Alexis Kanyerengwe. Moreover, since independence and the 
abolition of the monarchy "with Belgium's help," the country's 
past is seen in Rwanda as uniformly equal to what it had become 
in the last years of colonization: A feudal-type kingdom in 
which the Tutsi chiefs oppressed the Hutu peasants. 
  As soon as the Blue Helmets arrived, the Belgians, who form 
half of them, were therefore the target of a campaign of 
denigration by Rwandan conservatives, especially since, in 
accordance with the peace plan, they escorted to Kigali an FPR 
battalion responsible for the protection of that party's future 
ministers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Robert Urbain: The Good Points and </F>

  [Text] What conclusions should be drawn from the GATT 
agreement reached on 15 December? Speaking on this subject at 
the Walloon Enterprises Union (UWE), Robert Urbain, minister of 
foreign trade and European affairs, listed the positive aspects. 
He highlighted four from a European viewpoint: "The growth 
incentives proposed in the white paper with regard to 
competitiveness and employment will be substantially increased," 
he stressed. Indeed, the OECD thinks that the liberalizing 
effect of a general reduction in tariffs will lead to an 
increase in the level of prosperity in the world equivalent to 
$270 billion for the year 2002. 
  "The legal guarantees have been strengthened: The 
multilateral rules bring clarity and certainty to trade, while 
restraining unilateral tendencies. 
  "The service sector which represents 60 percent of European 
GNP is subjected to multilateral regulation for the first time; 
the liberalization of services within the General Agreement on 
Trade in Services will facilitate the expansion in this sector. 
  "Intellectual property is protected thanks to the Uruguay 
Round. The Commission estimates the shortfall suffered by 
industry in the European Union through violations of royalties 
at ECU2.6 billion. In addition to this there is the forging of 
trademarks, violations of patents, and so forth. Our high 
technology industry can only benefit from better protection in 
this sphere." 
  As for the impact on the Belgian economy in particular, it 
seems promising because of the importance which foreign trade 
has for our GNP: "More than 60 percent of our GNP depends 
directly on foreign trade, whereas this figure varies between 20 
and 25 percent for most other industrialized countries." 
<H5>  Case Study </H5>
  Referring to the international flow of investments and their 
effects on employment, Robert Urbain warned against simplistic 
or glib ideas. This is a direct allusion to the debate on 
relocation which he refuses to avoid but which requires a degree 
of intellectual caution. "When a foreign enterprise is 
established in Europe, it creates jobs. However, it is 
important to see whether the production unit thus created does 
not replace local enterprises which will have to reduce their 
production. Let us bear in mind the transplanted Japanese 
automobile manufacturing factories: Their production competes 
directly with that of the European manufacturers." 
  The minister, an expert in case studies, then reversed the 
observation: "When a European enterprise creates subsidiaries 
abroad, it does not necessarily reduce employment on the Old 
Continent. For instance, when Belgian enterprises like Jansen 
Pharma and Bell Telephone create joint ventures in China, and 
when they are ranked first and second, that boosts Belgium's 
reputation on the Asian markets and not only generates exports 
in their own sector but also creates business opportunities for 
other enterprises and other national sectors." 
<H5>  Social Clause and Fair Trade </H5>
  Having said that, Urbain does not deny that the ferocity of 
international competition and the big disparities in production 
costs might prompt European enterprises to relocate to Asia, 
North Africa, or East Europe. "The government is aware of this 
problem," he stressed, while immediately noting that it must be 
tackled at the level of the European Union's trade policy, 
without ruling out its implications at the level of GATT and the 
future World Trade Organization (WTO, which will be established 
on 1 January 1995). What is the solution...? The minister 
referred to the suggestion to introduce a social clause: "In 
this sphere, many preliminary points will have to be resolved, 
like a definition of the fundamental social rights, the means of 
incorporating a social clause into agreements with third 
countries, the means of monitoring respect for this clause and 
punishing failure to respect it." 
  In the absence of the textbook case in which production 
conditions would be comparable throughout the world, free trade, 
pure and simple, is impossible, Robert Urbain also said. Hence 
his plea, instead of this, for a combination of "free trade" and 
"fair trade." 
  And he concluded with an appeal to continue the efforts. The 
result of the Uruguay Round "does not mean that the work is 
over." Belgium, like Europe, must pay more attention to the 
competitiveness of its economy in a more open world economy (and 
in particular stimulate high-level research and development), 
"multilateral negotiations must be furthered, especially as 
regards the link between trade and environment, and between 
trade and social rights."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Kooijmans by Nederland-1 </F>
anchorman Joop van Zijl; Kooijmans in Geneva and Van Zijl in 
Hiversum studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Van Zijl] Good evening, Mr. Kooijmans. 
  [Kooijmans] Good evening. 
  [Van Zijl] Last Monday [7 February], after the meeting of 
the 
European Ministers, you were about the only one to speak of a 
"ultimatum," although no decision had been made yet. But there 
is actually a ultimatum now that NATO has made a U-turn. Does 
that please you? 
  [Kooijmans] No, it does not [as heard], but I am satisfied 
that the international community has actually started to do 
something and has imposed a credible deadline within which 
certain things will have to be done. 
  [Van Zijl] Still, dangerous times may lie ahead. What is 
your assessment of the danger for the Dutch soldiers? 
  [Kooijmans] It is very difficult to say. Certain security 
measures have already been taken for the ground troops, i.e. if 
attacks are directed against UN troops, the representative of 
the [UN] Secretary General in Yugoslavia, Mr. Akashi, can ask 
for air support. That is already a certain guarantee. And it 
is well possible that now that the international community has 
finally used some credible language, this will also benefit the 
situation of the ground troops. 
  [Van Zijl] And then there are also our Dutch planes -- the 
F16s -- stationed in Villafranca.... 
  [Kooijmans] Yes, indeed, together with the French, the U.S., 
the British and the Turkish planes. 
  [Van Zijl] Now, a few words on politics: The Russians are 
being obstructive and are calling for an emergency meeting of 
the [UN] Security Council. Does this make sense? 
  [Kooijmans] Well, yes they have the right to do so... But 
resolution 836 gives the final authority to the [UN] Secretary 
General and that resolution would have to be revoked, which in 
my opinion is not very likely. 
  [Van Zijl] Finally Mr. Kooijmans, what is your personal 
feeling at this time? Have we finally reached some point or is 
this just a stop on the way to a fatal outcome? 
  [Kooijmans] Well, we have achieved something, we have 
reached 
a point where we have stated that some things are not tolerated. 
We are ready, if need be, to intervene with an iron hand, but I 
hope that this will not be necessary; a real peace agreement can 
only be achieved by the waring parties themselves. 
  [Van Zijl] Many thanks for your comments, Mr. Minister.

<F P=106> [Wio Joustra commentary: "Kooijmans Opts For Caution"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is precisely the fear of the 
same vulnerability in Bosnia which is at present influencing 
international diplomacy. And which -- quite suddenly although 
not surprisingly -- has led to a more balanced approach on the 
part of the Netherlands. The deployment of the reinforced 
battalion of the light mobile brigade in a Serb-controlled area 
of east Bosnia is largely to explain for this. 
  With the strong support of a virtually unanimous Parliament, 
the position of the Dutch Government has been interventionist 
since the very beginning of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. 
But the successive foreign ministers -- Van den Broek and 
Kooijmans -- often seemed to be no more than voices crying in 
the wilderness with their pleas for maximum international 
involvement, with air strikes against Serbian positions not 
being ruled out. 
  Alliance members with ground troops in Bosnia were much less 
strident. In The Hague, the positions adopted by London and 
Paris for example always met with more understanding among 
senior military officials at the Defense Ministry than among 
senior diplomats at the Foreign Ministry. The generals were 
guided by a firm adage from military history: "What you start 
in the air, you must finish on the ground." The most recent and 
best example of this is the Gulf War. 
  Applied to the situation in Bosnia, this means that air 
"support" for the blue helmets has never been a subject of 
controversy as it is part of the execution of humanitarian 
tasks. But this controversy does apply to air "strikes" on 
Serbian artillery positions. This is because it has never come 
to protecting major troop contingents as originally proposed by 
UN Secretary-General Butrus Ghali -- at least 34,000 troops to 
protect the Muslim safe areas. Even the later "soft option" of 
7,600 troops has never been anywhere near reached. 
  After a reserved response to the bloodbath in Sarajevo, 
Minister Kooijmans came out strongly in favor of guarantees on 
Wednesday via his NATO ambassador in Brussels. Just like the 
British have been doing for some time now, hundreds of Dutch 
soldiers will soon also be face to face with the Serbian 
military. 
  Kooijmans is also trying as much as possible to avoid any 
appearance of partisanship. It is in this context that his call 
to extend the NATO ultimatum to the town of Mostar must be seen. 
This town is in the stranglehold of Bosnian and Serb troops.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Senate Ratifying Treaty With </F>
Suriname"] 
  [Excerpt] The Hague -- Development Aid Minister Pronk 
expects that the Netherlands and Suriname will soon settle their 
disputes about the increase of development aid. 
  He told so in the Senate last night. The Senate ratified the 
framework treaty, which strengthens the ties between the 
Netherlands and Suriname in the fields of legal, military, 
diplomatic, cultural, and aid policies. 
  However, Pronk demands from the Suriname Government that a 
Structural Adjustment Program be implemented shortly. As far as 
the verification procedures are concerned, the minister says 
that they can be discussed with Suriname. Pronk also says that 
the restoration of the balance of payments aid which was 
suspended by the Netherlands in June last year without any prior 
consultation, can only be considered if an international 
financial institution supervises Suriname's progress with the 
Adjustment Program. Pronk hopes that he can still reach an 
agreement with Suriname on the increase of aid before the 
elections. [passage omitted]

  [Text] People wishing to visit the Netherlands for a period 
of more than three months are to apply for a residence permit at 
a Dutch Embassy or consulate. The measure will take effect on 1 
April. If such a permit cannot be produced at a Dutch port of 
entry, access to the Netherlands will be refused and no legal 
applications for admission to the country will be heard. 
  The Dutch Justice Ministry has introduced the measure in 
order to tighten its immigration policy further. At the moment, 
it's common practice among foreigners wishing to enter the 
Netherlands to apply for residence permits after arrival in the 
country. The measure does not apply to nationals of other West 
European countries and the United States, nor to refugees.

  [Text] Does Jacques Delors -- who has not reacted yet to 
the NATO ultimatum -- agree with NATO's pressure? This is the 
European Commission president's response, as recorded by Michel 
Barthelemy: 
  [Begin Delors recording] Given the point reached in the 
conflict, I would like to take my responsibility and say yes, 
hoping that this pressure would allow the peace process -- which 
is close to fruition -- to resume. This involves a 2 percent 
readjustment of the Serbian territory in order to allow the 
Muslims to have a viable state. The Bosnian Serbs and Croats 
have obtained satisfaction. Therefore, this pressure is part of 
the peace process. 
  I regret that a solemn warning had not been given before to 
those who have introduced the ideology of death that is ethnic 
cleansing. Today, things are what they are. Let us not return 
to the past. There is no point in doing so. I hope that this 
pressure will make everyone think and realize that they have 
more to lose than gain in pursuing the conflict. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Andreas Khol, foreign policy spokesman of </F>
the Austrian People's Party and executive secretary of the 
European Democratic Union: "Austria Negotiates All Obstacles in 
Its Path"] 
  [Text] Austria applied to join Europe in July 1989 -- when 
the Cold War and the iron curtain still divided the continent. 
It was a logical step for a country which had always felt in 
tune with the goals and objectives of western democracies. 
  Today Austria is on the last lap of an exhausting marathon 
to 
become a full member of the European Union [EU]. Despite some 
remaining pitfalls, the signs are that membership will be won at 
the beginning of 1995. 
  Before then, however, there is much work to be done and time 
is running out. A great deal is at stake and failure would 
result in a serious setback for the EU and the other European 
Free Trade Association applicants. It would also adversely 
affect the hopes of the new democracies of central and eastern 
Europe. 
  On the positive side, Austria has negotiated satisfactory 
terms with the EU which allow it to retain its higher 
environmental standards. It is also to continue its antinuclear 
policy. This is especially important to an electorate who, in 
1978, voted against commissioning a nuclear reactor near Vienna. 
  In addition, agreement has been reached on the regional fund 
and relative financial benefits. Arrangements with Japan worth 
62 billion schillings ($5bn) on Austrian-made components in 
imported Japanese cars have also been confirmed. 
  The Austrian interpretation that Maastricht is compatible 
with neutrality has also been accepted. Austria adopted 
permanent neutrality in a constitutional law passed by 
parliament in 1955. 
  This means it will never accede to military alliances, nor 
permit the establishment of foreign military bases on her 
territory. 
  Most Austrians associate neutral status with peace, 
stability 
and prosperity. With the end of the Cold War, neutrality cannot 
have the same meaning as in the past, nor offer the same 
guarantees of security for the future. 
  With the prospect of increasing regional and ethnic 
conflicts 
Austria's position is more vulnerable than ever. Its security 
can be found only within the framework of a common policy with 
the European Union. 
  As regards EU membership, Austria will agree to join the 
West 
European Union [WEU] as an observer. It is keen to develop 
comprehensive security arrangements emerging out of the EU, WEU, 
NATO and CSCE. Austria intends to make a full contribution and 
to show solidarity with its partners. 
  Despite this progress, some hard-core issues are yet to be 
settled. The most delicate of these relate to agriculture, 
secondary residences and transit traffic. 
  Several problems remain. Does the internal market come into 
effect immediately on entry or will Austrian produce and markets 
be granted a transitional period? The government is pushing for 
a transition of four years because there are adaptation problems 
for many farmers who would go to the wall, or have to be 
supported by generous subsidies. The question is whether the EU 
would be prepared to share the burden. Austria will be a net 
contributor to EU coffers and a suitable arrangement seems 
likely. 
  The second agricultural problem concerns quotas for future 
Austrian production in the Union, namely beef, milk, sugar, 
pork, wine, wheat and other agricultural products. On this the 
EU has so far failed to make a satisfactory offer. A solution 
will probably be found. 
  On the delicate issue of transit traffic, the EU must agree 
to continue with the present valid agreement. Secondary 
residences is more a psychological than an economic or political 
question. Here one has to respect the Alpine people's wishes 
not to be submerged or destroyed by rich city people. 
  These last points are essential preconditions if the 
government is to go ahead with a referendum, which could take 
place on 12 June. Austria is prepared to negotiate beyond the 
March deadline and even into the autumn to achieve the best deal 
for its farmers and the Tyroleans. This is vital not only for 
their well-being but also for a positive outcome to the 
referendum. If the coalition government of Social Democrats and 
Christian Democrats feels its conditions have not been met and 
the referendum is likely to go against membership, it would 
prefer to wait. Much hinges on Austria, because then Sweden and 
Finland would be unable to organise their own referendums. 
  Austrian negotiators, however, are optimistic all will work 
out on the day. Polls show a consistent, albeit narrow, pro-EU 
majority. They show that Europe is now seen as the most 
important Austrian issue -- above immigration, jobs and 
terrorism. 
  Pundits are predicting a 55 percent majority in favour of 
Europe, but many voters are still undecided and the government 
cannot count its chickens before they hatch. The small Green 
Party is divided, but opposed to Maastricht. Joerg Haider's 
Freedom Party is difficult to assess. The new Liberal Party is 
pro-European. 
  Come 28 February, exhausted negotiators will sign an 
agreement with the EU. It is inconceivable that this will 
falter over 50,000 tonnes of milk, or six or nine years for 
transit traffic, or ECU50 million more or less of subsidies. 
After June, Austria can look forward to becoming a full member 
of a united Europe -- which is where it has always belonged.

<F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F>
reporter] 
  [Excerpts] The Prime Minister today welcomed yesterday's 
NATO decision to establish an exclusion zone around besieged 
Sarajevo as a means of reinforcing the peace process. But at 
Commons question time he ruled out the use of ground troops in 
other areas of strife-torn former Yugoslavia as "not a practical 
proposition." 
  Mr Major said there would be renewed diplomatic efforts to 
end the conflict following the NATO ultimatum. 
  "No course in Bosnia is free of risks. That has been the 
case from the beginning and it is now," he admitted. But to do 
nothing in the face of mortar attacks on Sarajevo was not an 
option. 
  Shortly after, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, reporting to 
MPs on the latest NATO initiative, said: "No one would pretend 
this was an easy decision. The risks are clear. So are the 
advantages if it succeeds." 
  He called on the Bosnian Serbs to respond: "Their aims 
cannot 
be achieved on the battlefield nor by killing and mutilating 
civilians." [passage omitted] 
  Mr Major said the measures agreed yesterday were intended 
"primarily to reinforce the peace process." 
  He said: "There will be renewed diplomatic efforts to 
encourage all sides to reach agreement and stick to it. But I 
do not myself believe that doing nothing in the circumstances 
that have now arisen is an option that would be right for this 
House to adopt, or right for NATO. We do not favour purely 
punitive action. Force should not be used unless it is 
genuinely necessary and helps the chance of a peaceful 
settlement." 
  Mr Major said NATO had warned all sides to cease the 
bombardment of Sarajevo. It has taken specific and carefully 
constructed decisions to reinforce the efforts of commanders on 
the ground. But the objective is to help the civilian 
population without changing the character of the UN role." 
  Later he told Calum Macdonald (Lab Western Isles) that there 
was no "feasible or certain means of resolving the problem from 
outside. But the NATO decision of yesterday will put all 
parties under heavier pressure to stop the bombardment and make 
peace." 
  Mr Macdonald said there could be no moral or logical 
justification for distinguishing betwen Sarajevo and other "safe 
areas" in Bosnia. "Will you undertake to work to extend the 
ultimatum issued in respect of Sarajevo to other safe areas?" he 
demanded. 
  The Prime Minister replied: "We have to determine what is 
practical. To follow to its logical conclusion the concern you 
have set out would involve us becoming involved, very probably, 
with troops on the ground right across the whole area of the 
conflict. However strongly you may feel about the matter, that 
is not a practical proposition." 
  In his statement, Mr Hurd told the House that the war would 
not end by military victory. 
  He added: "A lasting settlement cannot be imposed. It can 
only be achieved by agreement between the parties." The 
Government now looked to the parties involved in the conflict, 
particularly the Bosnian Serbs, to respond. 
  He insisted: "Their aims cannot be achieved on the 
battlefield, nor by killing and mutilating civilians. They 
should end the siege of Sarajevo to hand it over to UN 
administration. Such an agreement would mark a real step 
towards peaceful settlement." 
  On NATO's move, Mr Hurd added: "No one would pretend that 
this was an easy decision. The risks are clear -- so are the 
advantages if it succeeds." It was the job of government "to 
test and retest options of this kind," said the Foreign 
Secretary. There is a strong British interest in maintaining 
the strength and solidarity of NATO. "In Bosnia, our interest 
lies in preventing the war from spreading, in helping forward 
the work for a peace settlement and in relieving the suffering 
of the Bosnian people. We judge that these interests are best 
sustained by supporting the NATO decision and working for its 
success."

Bundeswehr soldiers boarded the German frigate Cologne, heading 
for Mombasa in the neighboring country of Kenya. From there, 
the German UN soldiers are to start their flight home on 15 
February. The Cologne arrived in Mogadishu under the strictest 
security provisions. The military leadership said that the 
reason for this was that terrorist attacks could not be ruled 
out.

<F P=106> [Article by Leo Wieland: "Clinton's New Dual Strategy"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 11 Feb -- The Bosnian Muslims should 
not have any illusions after NATO's Sarajevo ultimatum: 
President Clinton does not want to win the war for them. The 
recent change in the White House's Balkans policy is rather 
based on a dual strategy. One part is the -- this time maybe 
somewhat more credible -- threat to carry out air strikes 
against Serb artillery positions, linked to the hope that these 
will not take place. The other part is the -- hitherto avoided 
-- political pressure on the Muslims with the objective to press 
for a territorial negotiated settlement in Geneva based on a 
partition of Bosnia. 
  Clinton, who does not see a military solution for Bosnia, 
and 
who, despite temporary success on the battlefield, sees the 
Muslims threatened by disastrous Serbian and Croatian spring 
offensives, would like to convince the government in Sarajevo to 
present a "reasonable" offer. In Washington's view, this should 
include a specific minimal territorial demand that would exactly 
specify important details -- such as access to the Adriatic and 
guaranteed links between Muslim enclaves that are surrounded by 
Serb territory. 
  Clinton was diplomatic when he told journalists that the 
United States first "would like to express what the legitimate 
and fundamental demands" of the Muslims are and then to "tell 
them clearly and honestly how we evaluate the political and 
military situation." A representative of the Washington 
Administration then explained the procedure: "If their offer is 
reasonable we will go to the Serbs and Croats and say: `Accept 
this deal or bad things might happen. If, however, you accept, 
then the sanctions may be eased.'" 
  Until the recent massacre in Sarajevo last Saturday [5 
February], Clinton rejected all European requests to bring his 
influence to bear more strongly on the Bosnian Government's will 
for a compromise. Under the impression of the recent cruel 
pictures from the Balkans, he then returned to an earlier 
formulation, according to which "for our nation clear interests 
are at stake in this conflict." Trying hard to demonstrate 
leadership, he defined the four aspects of these interests: 
NATO must prove to be the "credible peace power in Europe after 
the Cold War"; the conflict must be prevented from spreading; 
the streams of refugees must be contained; and the strangulation 
of Sarajevo must end "in the interest of humanity." 
  Without mentioning any details, Clinton pointed out that he 
had told Congress that "our contribution to the solution of the 
Bosnian conflict will correspond with our interests." White 
House sources have added that a military action would be limited 
to air strikes and would under no circumstances involve U.S. 
ground forces. One government spokesman added: "The point is 
to make it clear to the Bosnian Muslims that we will not help 
them to win this war and that within a rather small room (to 
maneuver in the negotiations) they will ultimately not get much 
more." 
  Clinton's new positioning in the case of Bosnia fits into 
the 
major framework of a redefinition of international peacekeeping 
missions with strictly limited U.S. participation. It is 
included in a presidential "decision directive" that was 
coordinated this week with congressional leaders and is now 
ready to be signed. In a contribution for THE NEW YORK TIMES, 
security adviser Lake described its basic elements: an 
interest-bound and "selective" commitment. 
  After he took office, Clinton still described international 
"peacekeeping" as one of the cornerstones of his foreign policy, 
while Lake now wrote the following: "Let us be clear about one 
thing: Peacekeeping is not in the center of our foreign or 
defense policy. The main task of our armed forces is not to 
engage in peacekeeping missions but to win wars. This 
administration does not have the intention to provide troops for 
a permanent international army." The President will not give up 
or limit his function of commander in chief and he will put U.S. 
soldiers under foreign command only in individual cases -- 
within the framework of NATO or as in the operation "Desert 
Storm." 
  According to Lake, the lessons learned in Somalia have led 
to 
a new "realism." One must not allow the United Nations to 
degenerate into a "garbage dump for conflicts that belligerent 
parties do not want to solve themselves." The questions the 
United States would ask in the Security Council in the future 
(also with respect to Bosnia) are: "Where is a threat to our 
interests? Is there a clearly defined mission? Is there a 
certain final point? How much will it cost? Are the resources 
available? What is the probability of success?" All in all, 
these questions constitute a whole bunch of factors that inhibit 
intervention -- even before the decision of Congress, which is 
increasingly opposed to any foreign "adventures."

France's Foreign Policy'"] 
  [Text] RPR [Rally for the Republic] defense policy expert 
Pierre Lellouche said that following NATO's ultimatum against 
the Serbs, "for the first time, there is a glimmer of hope" in 
former Yugoslavia; he condemned "kouchnerism, which dug the 
grave of foreign policy." 
  "We hid behind a veil of media-inspired excuses, posturing, 
and well-meaning generalities in order to avoid having to do 
anything, to try to influence the course of events at an earlier 
time," he stated during a radio program jointly sponsored by LA 
CROIX [Catholic daily]. "Kouchnerism -- that is, a humanitarian 
policy that sends soldiers to the field without providing them 
with a political goal nor military means -- acted as a grave 
digger for the foreign and defense policies of large democratic 
nations," added the Val-d'Oise representative, who stated that 
"this policy led us down a cul-de-sac, delayed decisive events, 
and in effect sanctioned the territorial status-quo." 
  To the question "must Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
be 
brought down?," Pierre Lellouche answers: "Of course, Milosevic 
must be brought down." "National-Communism and the dictators" 
which rule former Communist countries "will spell disaster for 
the world," he adds. On the subject of NATO's ultimatum, 
Jacques Chirac's diplomatic advisor says he is "very proud of 
the work done by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and the 
government. In the three years that this horror has been going 
on (in former Yugoslavia), this is the first time that we get 
out of the quagmire where we have lost our honor," he concluded. 
"For the first time, there is a glimmer of hope."

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that Turkey 
views positively and supports the decision NATO made on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina yesterday. 
  In a statement prior to the True Path Party General 
Administrative Council meeting, Ciller said Turkey has for a 
long time been defending the need to preserve 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's territorial integrity and to respect human 
rights. Pointing out the need to lift the arms embargo or to 
launch an air raid to achieve that goal, Ciller recalled that 
Turkey had submitted this plan to the United Nations. She 
continued: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] We had earlier proposed that the 
Serbs positioned on the mountains surrounding Sarajevo be moved 
back 20 km and that they surrender their arms. We had also 
proposed that an air raid be launched in the event they did not 
comply with these conditions -- in other words, that a 
transition period be established prior to the air raid. We 
support this decision made by NATO. We believe that it is 
positive. [end recording] 
  Ciller said the violence is continuing in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and humanity is waging a struggle for life and dignity. Pointing 
out that the innocent people of Bosnia-Herzegovina should either 
be given the opportunity to defend themselves or be protected, 
Ciller added that the NATO decision is a significant step in 
this direction. Noting that during her contacts with various 
leaders she was informed that such a development would occur, 
Ciller concluded by saying: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I hope that a better solution will 
be reached through peaceful means within 10 days. We will stand 
by this decision to the end. I would like to state once more 
the need to begin the air raid immediately if any clashes take 
place. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has expressed the 
view that the NATO decision reached on Bosnia-Herzegovina 
yesterday is significant in many aspects. 
  In a statement today, Cetin stressed that the decision is 
important from the viewpoint of the alliance's credibility and 
relations between North America and Europe. He said: We 
sincerely hope this decision will at least prevent further 
massacres and facilitate a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Cetin recalled that Turkey prepared a similar plan in August 
1992, and presented it to the five permanent UN Security Council 
members. He continued: From that moment on, Turkey has 
defended it views on the issue at every forum. When we look 
back, we see that it would have been preferable to reach a 
similar decision then, thus preventing the death of thousands of 
people. Diplomacy that is not supported by a convincing 
determination cannot succeed. This principle has once again 
been confirmed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now what remains to be 
done is to implement the decision without any changes and speed 
up efforts toward a solution. Turkey will continue to fulfill 
its duties on the issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Ib Konrad Jensen, Jens P. Skaarup: "Police </F>
Intelligence Service Is `Top Secret' -- Even German Legislation 
Is Stamped `Confidential' at Meetings"] 
  [Text] The Folketing and the PET [Police Intelligence 
Service] intend to lift a corner of the heavy veil of secrecy 
with plans for greater openness surrounding the intelligence 
service's work. When democracy has to defend itself against 
attack from its own citizens, it does so in a cloud of suspicion 
against the outside world that borders on pure hysteria. 
  The means and methods are so secret that only a handful or 
so 
of people know them. Even the identities of the opponents, the 
12,000 possible enemies of society, are confidential and only 
spoken of in general and opaque terms, faceless and nameless. 
  A parliamentary committee in the Folketing recently received 
a pile of documents with descriptions of how politicians and 
public authorities in the countries that are our neighbors have 
tried to open up their intelligence services. The documents 
were collected by the PET for the use of the five members of the 
special control committee for the intelligence services. 
  As an ingrained reaction, the PET stamped all the documents 
as confidential. The five committee members could not even 
reveal anything to the public of a bill that had previously been 
put before the German Bundestag. The German bill was generally 
available in its home country, but in Denmark it had to be kept 
secret. 
<H5>  Cold War Rules of Play </H5>
  According to the most recent figures from the PET, the 
service employs some 350 full-time agents and office staff to 
keep an eye on Danish and foreign nationals. Additionally, 
there are approximately 50 loosely attached police personnel 
from each of the country's 54 policing districts and an unknown 
number of informers who either volunteer or are paid to supply 
the PET with information and observations. 
  The bulk of the permanent staff is stationed in the 
headquarters at Bellahoej in Copenhagen, while smaller groups 
are stationed in the service's six regional offices. Their 
tasks are described in a booklet that was drawn up in 1953 
during the Cold War's deep-freeze period by Hans Haekkerup, the 
then Social Democratic justice minister. 
  The manual broadly describes whom the PET is to keep an eye 
on, what means may be used, and how the service is generally to 
conduct itself. The details of the job -- which 
anticonstitutional or political groups the service is to spy on 
-- are decided by the government and justice minister in office 
at any given time. 
  The 41-year-old manual has never been given to -- let alone 
approved by -- the Folketing. Like the directives of the 
successive ministers for justice, it is strictly confidential. 
<H5>  200-Million-Kroner Cost </H5>
  If we ignore defense, then the PET is in every respect the 
one public institution subject to the least public control and 
access. The PET budget is concealed in the Folketing's general 
funding of the police, and nowhere can outsiders read exactly 
how much money are spending on the secret service. But, based 
on the number of employees, the size of the payroll alone can be 
estimated at 80-100 million kroner [DKr] annually, and with 
expenses for travel, equipment, offices, fees to informers, and 
so on, we approach a total expenditure of somewhere between 
DKr150 and 200 million. 
  The only outsider who knows the correct figures is a 
specially appointed member of staff in the State Audit 
Department. Once a year, this person looks through the PET 
accounts and budget, then informs the chief public auditor, in a 
written account, that all is in order. 
  The Folketing control committee is aware of the general 
budgetary position of the two intelligence services. SF 
[Socialist People's Party] member Jens Thoft has on a number of 
occasions asked to receive the actual budgets, but has never had 
a reply. 
<H5>  Baroque Rituals </H5>
  The parliamentary control committee was established by law 
in 
1988 on the basis of a bill presented by the SF, following the 
famous affair of the two Danish reserve officers who were 
arrested and charged with espionage while on a "tourist trip" in 
Poland. The government never admitted that the people in 
question were on a mission for the intelligence service, but the 
furor did result in the Folketing seeking greater control over 
the activities of the services -- in practice, however, only as 
regards the general guidelines. 
  The committee's work is subject to a series of baroque 
rituals serving to deepen the cloud of mystery that always 
hovers over an intelligence service. All documents from the PET 
-- for example, answers to questions from the committee -- are 
sent by courier in a sealed envelope. The envelope is delivered 
to the committee secretary, who can only open it and check its 
contents in the presence of one of the committee members. All 
the committee papers are put in a safe purchased especially for 
the purpose and placed in a secure room in the Folketing. Only 
the secretary has the key and code to the door into the room, 
while only the committee members know the code to the safe. If a 
committee member wishes to read the papers sometime other than 
in a meeting, this may only be done under the supervision of the 
secretary. 
  Two Folketing security guards are summoned before each of 
the 
six to seven meetings held each year. Under the supervision of 
the secretary and two committee members, they have to carry the 
safe's by now rather voluminous contents to the office of the 
department head in the Defense Ministry, where all the meetings 
take place. The dates of the meetings are secret. 
<H5>  Shocking Information </H5>
  The oldest control body is the so-called Wamberg Committee, 
named after Chief Administrative Officer A.M. Wamberg, the first 
chairman of the committee, from Vejle. The committee was set up 
in 1964, after POLITISK REVY newspaper revealed that at that 
time 300,000-400,000 Danes were registered, suspected of being 
liable to practice subversion. It was the first time 
"civilians" got a glimpse of the state authorities' zealous 
monitoring of its subjects. 
  "It did not surprise me so much to see who was registered, 
but it was shocking to see how much private information they had 
on people," a member from that era said. 
  The four committee members then, as now, had to content 
themselves with checking that the PET registration of Danish 
citizens remained within the guidelines laid down by the justice 
minister and the government. At that time, in the early 
sixties, the guidelines were fairly all-embracing, and 
membership of the Danish Communist Party was more than enough to 
ensure that the PET found it worthwhile to make a registration. 
  Only with a government circular in 1968 were the rules cut 
back so that registration could no longer be justified by 
political activities alone. The word "alone" is to be 
understood quite literally. If someone breaks the law for any 
reason -- for instance in an ordinary case of shoplifting -- 
that is grounds enough to also register what political party, if 
any, he is a member of. 
  The number of those registered has fallen considerably since 
the lunacy of the 1950's, and today there are around 62,000 
people listed in the PET files, including some 50,000 people in 
public positions who require a special security clearance. The 
remainder, some 12,000 Danes, are people whom the PET suspects 
of wanting to practice terrorism, use political violence, or spy 
for foreign powers. 
<H5>  Modest Control </H5>
  The four members of the Wamberg Committee are chosen by the 
justice minister, and they represent the minister, not the 
general public, in relation to the PET. Each time PET wishes to 
register a Dane, add new information to the file of somebody 
already registered, or supply information to another authority, 
it has to seek the committee's approval. The committee meets 
seven or eight times a year, and on these occasions it is 
presented with a pile of at least 50 new and old names, 
sometimes even more. Occasionally the committee turns down the 
PET request, but this rarely happens. 
  One committee member said of his job: "It is my view that 
all power corrupts. So there should be the greatest possible 
supervision of power. It is a good thing that a committee such 
as the Wamberg Committee exists, so the PET is not tempted to do 
anything wrong, or even unlawful." 
  The committee also carries out random testing to check 
whether the PET may have slipped new information into the file 
without the its knowledge. At best, the four committee members 
get through somewhere between eight and 10 of the 12,000 cases 
in any one meeting. The sampling may be entirely random, but the 
committee is often inspired by articles from the daily press. 
"`What do we have on him, then?' we ask, and so the secretary 
fetches the case papers," Chief Administrative Officer Bodil 
Panild, the committee chairman from Soroe, remarked. 
  The Wamberg Committee has no opportunity of checking the 
information and assessments on which the PET bases its request 
to make a registration. Neither does the committee have any 
influence on the political criteria for registration. Bodil 
Panild said the committee has to rely on PET's information and 
assessments, but that on the other hand she does not think PET 
would have anything to gain from misleading the committee. 
  "I would not say that we identify ourselves with the PET. 
But our understanding of the reasons for registration is 
improving, and if you ask me whether I think an intelligence 
service such as the PET is necessary, my answer is a clear yes. 
There will always be extremists and groups that want to 
overthrow norms that are otherwise accepted by The Danish 
democracy," Bodil Panild said. 
  The discretion with which PET works determines what slips 
out 
about the service's activities. 
<H5>  Dull Job </H5>
  But several former bosses and justice ministers strongly 
maintain that the 300 or more staff do a good job. The PET job 
is to prevent and counteract attacks on state security, and the 
fact that the public hears nothing, and that not many PET cases 
come before the courts, is proof that the service is doing its 
job, or so the story goes. Cases brought to court could also be 
a sign that the job is not being done properly, and that the 
service is incapable of uncovering anything at all. Said with a 
smile and a shrug. 
  The work of the PET has always been surrounded by great 
mystery and suspicion on the part of the outside world, but most 
of it is myth, due to too many bad spy films on TV and the 
service's own unwillingness to talk. Of course people are 
bugged, some 50 or so every day, and of course people are 
followed and letters opened, but by far the majority of the time 
is spent on dull and routine reading of open sources such as 
newspapers, periodicals, etc. In fact, PET work has a 
reputation for being so boring and lacking in challenge that the 
PET has difficulty in attracting good police officers. 
  "If you cannot do anything else, then you can always be a 
police researcher at PET", is not an uncommon remark among the 
police. 
  This article is based upon information from current and 
former employees of the PET, current and former members of the 
Wamberg Committee and the Folketing control committee.

  [Excerpts] Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes is 
very happy with the NATO ultimatum reached last Wednesday [9 
February]. NATO has given the Bosnian Serbs 10 days to lift the 
siege of Sarajevo. According to the minister, the Serbs now have 
no other choice than to retreat from their positions around the 
city by 21 February. Also Belgium is prepared to cooperate with 
possible air strikes, but Minister Claes says he thinks that our 
country will in the first place be asked to offer logistics 
support. [passage omitted] 
  Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes says he is not 
worried about the strong opposition of the Russians. He says 
that it is Moscow that is making a mistake, not NATO.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will meet with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade tomorrow in his 
capacity as president of the European Union's Foreign Ministers 
Council. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos announced Mr. 
Papoulias' one-day visit, noting that the goal is to seek an 
immediate, viable, and peaceful solution to the Bosnian problem. 
  Milan Milutinovic, ambassador of New Yugoslavia in Athens, 
this morning conveyed a request from Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic to former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis to 
undertake an initiative for the solution of the Yugoslav crisis. 
Last Saturday [12 February], Mr. Mitsotakis had a long 
telephone conversation with Mr. Milosevic. After his meeting 
with the honory chairman of New Democracy Party, the Yugoslav 
Ambassador expressed the hope that Mr. Mitsotakis will finally 
undertake an initiative, but did not define the content of this 
initiative. 
  However, a little later, the office of the former prime 
minister issued a written statement in which Mr. Mitsotakis 
calls upon the Government to undertake an initiative for a 
solution to the Bosnian crisis by virtue of the fact that it 
occupies the presidency of the European Union. Mr. Mitsotakis 
stresses that now, as was the case in the past, Greece must play 
its role decisively in defending peace. He further points out 
that Greece cannot remain a speechless and weak observer of 
historic developments which concern it directly and probably 
dramatically. 
  Diplomatic observers have described this statement as Mr. 
Mitsotakis' first move in Slobodan Milosevic's request for 
mediation, and they were sure that it will be followed by 
contacts between the former prime minister and the Government 
and probably by some initiatives abroad.

  [Excerpt] Brussels, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Bulgaria joined NATO's 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] on Monday [14 February], with 
President Zhelyu Zhelev expressing hope that the Atlantic 
alliance can persuade Russia to seal closer security ties with 
the rest of Europe. 
  Zhelev said he hoped adherence to the Partnership, the 
U.S.-led NATO intitiative to strengthen military cooperation 
with East European countries, would eventually lead to Bulgaria 
becoming a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. 
  In a speech at NATO headquarters here Zhelev stressed that 
"Bulgaria's arguments in favour of participation in NATO contain 
no elements whatever which might be seen as directed against 
Russia." 
  "On the contrary, we support the democratic and 
reform-minded 
forces in Russia and sincerely wish them success." 
  In reference to the resurgence of Russian ultranationalism 
fronted by extremist deputy and demagogue Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
Zhelev said he hoped NATO "will be in a position to find 
adequate ways and means of involving Russia in European security 
while keeping at bay the imperialist ambitions cherished by 
aspiring dictators." 
  Bulgaria became the eighth East European country to join the 
Partnership, with Latvia due to become the ninth later Monday. 
  Evoking the Bosnian war Zhelev added: "The conflicts on our 
doorstep are an immediate challenge to our national 
security...laying an unbearable burden on our reforming economy" 
in fallout from the United Nations sanctions against Serbia and 
Montenegro. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Aleksandur Vladkov in Brussels on </F>
Zhelev's news conference before his departure for Sofia -- live 
or recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] President Zhelev signed a framework 
agreement on cooperation with NATO in Brussels today. Before 
departing for Bulgaria, he gave a news conference for Bulgarian 
and foreign journalists. Let us hear the following report by 
our West Europe correspondent Aleksandur Vladkov. 
  [Vladkov] The Bulgarian president described the signing of 
the Partnership for Peace [PFP] agreement as an essential 
element in a very important process. He described the agreement 
as an introductory stage to the future integration of Bulgaria 
and the other East European countries as full members, on the 
one hand, and as the beginning of NATO's transformation into a 
collective, continental security structure, on the other hand. 
  The agreement is a challenge for speeding up the reforms in 
our country under a military-political aspect and under purely 
economic and social aspects. However, it is also a challenge 
for NATO in connection with the adjustment of the organization 
to the new realities in Europe and the world in the direction of 
a universal collective security structure, rather than in the 
direction of isolated military-political blocs. 
  Dwelling on the crisis in Yugoslavia and on the war in 
Bosnia, President Zhelev pointed out as follows: The conflicts 
in the immediate vicinity of our border are directly challenging 
our national security and are causing immeasurable difficulties 
for our economic reform, because of the international sanctions. 
  Nevertheless, Bulgaria's policy remains well-intentioned, 
peace-loving, and based on moral principles. I am sure that all 
civilized, democratic countries will duly appreciate it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zheliu Zhelev, president of the Republic of </F>
Bulgaria, by Edouard Van Velthem in Brussels; date not given: 
"On NATO and Balkan Security"] 
  [Text] [Van Velthem] You have come to Brussels to sign the 
Partnership for Peace which NATO is offering to the countries of 
East Europe. Some of these countries -- Poland in particular -- 
have made no secret of their disappointment at the timidity of 
this initiative. Do you believe that this cooperation goes far 
enough or were you expecting more from the Atlantic alliance? 
  [Zhelev] From the point of view of Bulgaria's national 
security, you cannot say that this initiative goes very far. 
Despite the statements by its senior officials on joint 
security, NATO gives no guarantees to the countries which adhere 
to this Partnership. It would be a different situation if we 
could institutionalize this process. 
  However, this program does show NATO's desire to encourage 
the emergence of an open democratic system from which nobody is 
excluded. NATO -- and this is very positive -- has refused to 
divide the countries into different categories, such as the 
Visegrad group, the Balkan states, or the Baltic states. The 
Partnership gives an equal chance to all and allows each country 
to commit itself to the extent that its financial and moral 
resources will allow. It is a very realistic approach and it 
permits the necessary double adaptation: By the candidates 
prior to their final membership, and by NATO which must change 
from a military bloc facing an indistinct enemy into a 
collective security system, continental and Euro-Atlantic. 
  [Van Velthem] How do you feel about Moscow's lack of 
enthusiasm for the project? 
  [Zhelev] None of our countries need any longer fear Russian 
influence, the age of the Soviet empire is over. We are 
independent, sovereign states with an autonomous foreign policy, 
and nobody can determine our priorities for us. 
  [Van Velthem] Doesn't the rise of the ultranationalist 
Zhirinovskiy worry you rather more? 
  [Zhelev] Political developments in Russia itself could be 
cause for concern if revanchist elements were to become 
dominant, fuelled by reawakened imperialist ambitions which 
account for the rise of Zhirinovskiy. We expelled Zhirinovskiy 
for what he said in Sofia. This move itself demonstrates the 
total independence of our diplomacy, as does the recognition of 
Macedonia and Russia as independent states before the break-up 
of the USSR -- a move which in fact surprised our Western 
partners. 
  [Van Velthem] What did you say to your NATO hosts concerning 
their recent ultimatum addressed to the Serbian forces in Bosnia? 
  [Zhelev] I see this initiative as remaining within the 
framework of measures to achieve a peaceful settlement. It is 
the final stage in such a process and I hope the ultimatum will 
fully accomplish its role as a warning, without having to be 
implemented. The parties involved in the conflict and to whom it 
is addressed must clearly understand that NATO, in committing 
itself so categorically, cannot now turn back. It is up to them 
to make every effort to favor a diplomatic solution to the 
crisis. 
  [Van Velthem] Bulgaria itself is suffering from the embargo 
on Serbia.... 
  [Zhelev] This is true, we have suffered enormous financial 
losses due to the sanctions. More than the other neighboring 
countries -- with the exception of Macedonia -- as Bulgaria is 
the most isolated and all gateways to the West must pass through 
Serbia. This is why we have raised the matter of compensation, 
especially indirect compensation: The reevaluation of our 
foreign debt, investment aid, and funding for regional 
infrastructure projects in the communications and transport 
sectors. In particular the highway linking Istanbul and Sofia, 
via Skopje, to Italy. Or the highway between Salonica, Sofia, 
and the Bulgarian port of Vidin on the Danube. 
  [Van Velthem] A motion of censure against the government -- 
which is accused of slowing down reforms -- has just been 
rejected in Sofia. Can Bulgaria afford a political crisis? 
  [Zhelev] In Central Europe and the Balkans, crisis -- 
political and economic -- is always with us. It is the price we 
must pay for changing from one system to another. But there is 
no turning back. We should clearly distinguish between the 
restoration of communism, which is excluded, and the return to 
power of the former Communists, which is plausible. The 
essential thing is to continue with the reforms, the identity of 
those charged with the task is of secondary importance. Today, 
in East Europe and especially in Bulgaria, the former Communists 
of the nomenklatura -- who have money and key positions -- are 
becoming genuine capitalists. Sometimes even including certain 
groups which tend towards Mafia-like practices. 
  [Van Velthem] You yourself have been accused of being a 
"neo-Communist" by your former friends, who are now in 
opposition.... 
  [Zhelev] These are just arbitrary accusations. The only 
institution which guarantees stability, democratic change, and 
the dismantling of the communist system in Bulgaria is the 
presidency of the Republic. You need look no further to 
understand why it is criticized from all sides. But my training 
in philosophy allows me to remain calm in the face of such 
criticism.

<F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F>
Giampiero Martinotti in Paris; date not given: "Low Employment 
in a `Santa Claus' State"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Martinotti] Mr. Paye, the 
American recovery is strong, but the rise in the cost of money 
has been received with concern by financial markets. Could this 
have negative consequences on Europe? 
  [Paye] The rise in U.S. interest rates comes as no surprise, 
the FED president himself had intimated that it was coming. The 
U.S. recovery is vigorous, but the fourth quarter rhythm (5.9 
percent on an annual basis) will not be maintained, and it is 
better this way, as it is important to avoid inflationary 
pressures. The mechanical effect on Europe of a recovery in the 
United States is relatively modest, whilst the psychological 
effect is substantial, and the rise in rates will probably have 
marginal repercussions. 
  [Martinotti] In Europe, on the other hand, the situation 
remains difficult, though for varying reasons from one country 
to the next. Is there not the risk of a new tightening? 
  [Paye] The European landscape is very diverse. We have a 
Britain which is experiencing respectable growth, and we have 
continental Europe, which is in a far from brilliant situation, 
for various reasons. In Germany we have small signs of a 
recovery, very limited fluctuations, but I believe what we have 
here is a major, in-depth task. A whole series of rigidities is 
being called into question, and Germany's industrial apparatus 
is growing tougher. Let us not forget the shock which the 
country has had to face. France passed through the trough of the 
economic cycle six months ago, and there is a beginning of 
recovery, but unemployment is still climbing. The French 
authorities have continued to make consistent choices, aimed at 
long term credibility and European integration. 
  [Martinotti] And Italy? 
  [Paye] Seen from the outside, Italy is typified, once again, 
by a kind of intrinsic vitality, an economic tissue, a capacity 
for individual initiative, and a remarkable and encouraging 
spirit of enterprise. The fact that the political difficulties 
are reflected on the economic situation certainly comes as no 
surprise. This applies everywhere. But the fact remains: the 
country's economic basis is full of vitality. 
  [Martinotti] Many are asking, insistently, for a sharp cut 
in 
interest rates in order to relaunch Europe's economy. Do you 
not feel that the monetary authorities are being overly prudent? 
And that a large drop in the cost of money could genuinely 
prime the recovery? 
  [Paye] In France and Germany, during the past 12 months, 
rates have come a long way in this direction; long-term rates 
are at historically low levels, which is a sign of markets' 
confidence. Rates have an influence on economic activity, but 
the time frame within which a decrease in the cost of money can 
manifest its positive effects is open to debate, and it may be 
that, because of the many changes which have occurred on the 
financial markets, the interest rate weapon is less important 
than it was 20 years ago. Nobody can say that a reduction in 
short-term rates has a rapid effect and that the monetary lever 
alone can give the desired results. 
  [Martinotti] And yet, one has the impression that many 
countries are continuing to reason as in the past, rather than 
being concerned with the problems of the future. 
  [Paye] In an open world, to be successful, economic policy 
depends increasingly on its credibility on international 
markets. A country's ability to manage its affairs autonomously 
has diminished, hence the fundamental nature of the search for 
credibility. 
  [Martinotti] Is a country like Italy credible, which every 
time that it is no longer able to bide by the rules of the game 
which it has accepted, resolves its problems with a competitive 
devaluation? 
  [Paye] This is not specifically Italian behavior. Many 
countries have devalued. But I repeat: In an open economy, 
every country has to offer economic operators sufficiently 
stable and secure reference points. 
  [Martinotti] In a situation like the one Europe is in, with 
growing unemployment and a recovery which is slow in showing 
itself, is it still possible to maintain a welfare system like 
the one we have known so far? 
  [Paye] We are living in a world economy which is opening 
up. In the long term, this is a positive phenomenon, on 
condition that one knows how to adapt. The wealthiest OECD 
countries believed that the growth of the 1950's and 1960's 
would be continuous and therefore continued to strengthen their 
social protection systems, and to multiply guarantees. This was 
the case in particular in Europe, where adaptability is lower 
than is really needed. It is true that this is a political and 
social problem. We have to ask people to move, to give up a 
little of their comfort. This creates fear, because people ask: 
"Change for what?" What is clear is that the solutions cannot 
be those which make for further rigidity; otherwise Europe will 
remain cut off from the rest of the world and from its 
development. We have to incite people to adapt. This is in 
itself salutary, but being salutary with the public deficits 
which we have means calling into question the social security 
system which in Europe is subject to abuse, and which protects 
and reimburses in an often excessive fashion. We need a 
formidable effort, which will not be done in a day. Governments 
must inform, explain, persuade, and pay attention to 
marginalized people. Salaries have to be linked to 
productivity, but for lowly qualified jobs the problem is to 
find a way to integrate an overly low salary so as to make it 
into a decent income. There are no miracle solutions. 
  [Martinotti] What does reforming the welfare state mean? 
  [Paye] The system has to be changed, there is no doubt. When 
it comes to health insurance: Do we need to reduce payments and 
control costs or else privatize and maintain a solidarity system 
only for those on low incomes? There is a wealth of debate and 
analyses, but the OECD is unable to make detailed 
recommendations. Every country has its traditions and each one 
must make choices based on its needs. The same language applies 
to the pensions system. 
  [Martinotti] You say that you are convinced of the need for 
change, but governments appear to be thinking more of the 
immediate situation, and not of making changes. Their 
overriding concern is monetary stability or other equilibria. 
One could almost say that they are looking at the future with 
today's and yesterday's eyes, not tomorrow's. That is they are 
not planning the future? Does it not seem like this to you? 
  [Paye] No. Your vision supports state interventionism. I am 
much more in favor of giving room for private initiative and 
inventiveness. Monetary stability policies set out to 
contribute to constructing a stable framework for business. 
Governments must provide clear and equitable ground rules: 
Inflation and protectionism distort the rules of the game. 
Otherwise they should play the role of arbiter. 
  [Martinotti] Corporate interests and those of society are 
not 
always one and the same. Right now European companies are 
laying off people in order to guarantee their productivity in 
the face of competition, but does this approach not contrast 
with that of their countries, already afflicted with 
historically high levels of unemployment? 
  [Paye] One must think not only of the destruction of jobs, 
but also of job creation. In an economy, 10 percent of jobs 
disappear during a year, but another 10 percent are created. 
This, of course, is not a crisis situation like we know it now. 
But there is no contradiction between the interests of 
individual corporations and those of society as a whole. 
  [Martinotti] But for the last three years Europe has no 
longer been able to produce jobs, rather the opposite.... 
  [Paye] Certainly, because it has become overly rigid. 
  [Martinotti] And perhaps also because companies lay off 
people easily, in the knowledge that a safety net exists in the 
form of the welfare system? 
  [Paye] The provident state, the welfare state, no longer has 
the financial resources to play the role of Santa Claus. It is 
now at the end of its possibilities. I believe that we are 
moving toward greater human creativity. I am fundamentally 
optimistic. Mentalities are already beginning to change, people 
are understanding the need for greater individual 
responsibility, that one needs to accept to take risks, that 
greater mobility is beneficial to us, and that a change in value 
systems is essential. 
  [Martinotti] To sum up with an image: Europeans must stop 
thinking that, when they return home from work every day, they 
will find hot soup prepared by someone? 
  [Paye] No, it is not like that. In order to be sure that 
every day there will be someone at home to prepare the soup, one 
has to be capable, in a world of rapid change, to demonstrate 
initiative, an ability to adapt and research. It is also 
necessary that society as a whole be able to demonstrate its 
desire to help those who have to make this adjustment, and to 
the weakest. We need to work more and differently, but this 
does not mean that we will move away from a system of social 
protection, conquered with much effort, to the law of the jungle.

<F P=106> [Speech by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at an international </F>
symposium on the 175th anniversary of the Friedrich-Wilhelm 
University in Bonn on 19 January] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Ladies and Gentlemen, the 
European orientation of our country is among the greatest 
achievements accomplished during the 40 years of the FRG's 
existence. Today, it is a natural foundation of our political 
culture. 
  Even though it has become fashionable again among some 
people 
to preach "Europessimism," no one can ignore the fact that 
Germany's integration into a union of European democracies has, 
meanwhile, become irreversible. We would fail in the eyes of 
history, yes, we would deliberately gamble away great capital, 
if we were to bow to that advice today that says we should, 
first of all, deal with the challenges resulting from German 
unification and only secondly take care of European unification. 
Leaving European integration would not only be suicidal in 
political terms; it would also destroy the bases of our 
prosperity and, not least, millions of jobs. 
  I deliberately say this in such dramatic terms, because many 
people have meanwhile forgotten why we have lived in peace for 
such a long time. We owe this to European integration to a 
decisive extent. It has contributed to overcoming rivalries and 
conflicts that had existed for centuries between the various 
nations. As a result of the process of European unification, we 
have been able to unite our strengths in Europe for mutual 
benefit. 
  In view of the dramatic changes in the world over the past 
years, common action by all Europeans is as important today as 
it was during the years after the end of World War II. It is 
now necessary to prove that this old continent does not suffer 
from decrepitude, but that it is able to develop its entire 
dynamism and a really youthful strength. 
  This is not only a question of economy and finances. Whoever 
believes -- and this is understandable in times of high 
unemployment and difficult economic problems -- that he can 
solve all problems via the economy, will be wrong. We have seen 
again and again that the decisive precondition for a change for 
the better is remembering one's intellectual-cultural bases. 
Therefore, the issues of education and training belong at the 
center of the discussion about safeguarding our future. 
  The German education and training system has a traditionally 
good reputation. Nevertheless, we must ask ourselves today 
whether this system fully lives up to the changed requirements 
and conditions. Whoever undertakes university studies in Germany 
after leaving school is almost 30 years old on average when he 
enters professional life. At the same time, the average 
retirement age of men is 59 years. This means that, in many 
cases, 50 years of training and retirement are set off by only 
about 30 years of productive work. This calculation cannot be 
positive. 
  What we need is a young generation that is confident it can 
live up to the challenges. However, we need an older generation 
that conveys this confidence and also points out opportunities 
just as much. Furthermore, our country needs the creativity and 
the intellectual mobility in particular of young people in 
professional life. 
  On the international labor market, the German university 
graduate has clear disadvantages compared with his younger 
foreign competitors. Structural reforms in the university 
sector leading to a reduction of the average studying time are 
long overdue. This is also necessary to strengthen our 
universities in research and scientific teaching. 
  The number of drop-outs is too high. In addition, almost 
one-fourth of university graduates work in a job that does not 
correspond to their academic training. The time is ripe to also 
come to structural decisions in education policy that make the 
overall system of education and training, science and research 
more efficient and flexible. This is not so much a question of 
finances, but, rather, one of being open-minded to new ideas. 
  As a convinced federalist, I respect the distribution of 
powers between the Federal Government and the laender, which is 
set down in the Constitution. However, the questions of 
education and training are also issues of national importance. 
Whoever is responsible is also obligated to act. I cannot 
understand it at all when the laender block urgently needed 
modernization measures. It is the laender that can and must 
make decisive progress with the necessary structural reforms. 
University reforms cannot be carried out successfully against 
the universities, but only together with them. 
  Our country's ability to face the future is decided in the 
university sector, in science and research. We depend more than 
others on innovations, on intelligent products and qualified 
services, that is, in particular, from the creativity and the 
training qualifications of our working people. In this 
connection, it is particularly important to bring together at 
the universities young scientists and future managers from the 
most varied range of countries. 
  Despite the need for broad education at a high level, one 
thing is indispensable: Our universities must once again be 
able to work under conditions that facilitate and promote top 
achievements. Liberal democracy, more than any other form of a 
state, needs a good atmosphere, a common will to promote 
achievements. This has nothing to do with a so-called elbow 
mentality, but is an important precondition for a country having 
a future at all. 
  The essential element of a university is autonomy. In our 
German university system we must expand the leeway for the 
individual universities' own responsibility. The universities 
in Germany must have the opportunity -- yes, they must be 
motivated -- to try out new approaches themselves and to give 
themselves an independent profile with innovative forms of 
teaching and research. Basically, it is a question of internal 
readiness and intellectual attitude whether we will be able to 
manage the breakthrough to structural changes and to overcoming 
ossification. This applies to the education sector just as to 
other fields of politics. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, progress in European integration also 
requires further modernization in economy and society in our 
country. Already in the past, the opening of borders in Europe 
essentially contributed to growth and employment in Germany and 
among our neighbors. 
  We must realize that international competition is 
intensifying. In addition to the expanding national economics in 
the East Asian and Pacific area, we now have an industrious and 
highly motivated competition right in front of our own door. I 
am thinking of countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, or 
Hungary. Their production costs only a fraction of what it 
costs here. We want these countries to be economically 
successful. They should not remain dependent on Western aid, 
but be able to earn their foreign currency themselves. Also 
with a view to these developments, we must make changes in our 
country and change our way of thinking. 
  Even though some people no longer want to recognize this 
today, we Germans owe the European Community an unprecedented 
degree of prosperity. About three-fourths of our exports today 
go to the European economic area, about two-thirds of our 
imports come from there. Thus, whoever today calls for "less 
Europe," puts at stake many millions of jobs that are 
safeguarded by the interlacement with our partners in Europe. 
  What we have achieved in Europe in the past must be 
safeguarded and expanded for the future. The Maastricht Treaty, 
which came into force on 1 November last year despite all the 
pessimistic predictions, gives us new opportunities for that: 
  First: In order to lastingly ensure employment, growth, and 
prosperity in Europe and in Germany, we will implement the 
economic and monetary union. The future European currency will 
be as stable as our tested German mark. In order to ensure 
this, we have pushed through strict criteria for participation 
in the economic and monetary union in the Maastricht Treaty. In 
part, these preconditions include a solid economic and financial 
policy. We will never agree to weakening the criteria of 
stability! 
  For us, the decision of the European Council in favor of 
Frankfurt/Main as the seat of the European Monetary Institute, 
and thus also of the future European Central Bank, was 
particularly encouraging for us. This is a convincing sign of 
trust in our stability policy and an encouragement to continue 
on this course with determination. 
  Second: We want a common European policy in the important 
field of internal security. For many years I have stressed this 
necessity to the German and the international public -- in 
particular in view of the spread of organized crime and the 
international drug mafia. We must assume that, in 1993, the 
drug mafia has smuggled an amount into Europe -- primarily, of 
course, into the hard-currency countries -- that corresponds to 
the budget of the Kingdom of Belgium. 
  One need not be an expect to realize the changes that can be 
caused by this in the substance of our community. Since the 
wirepullers and helpers of crime operate all over Europe and all 
over the world nowadays, we must organize the struggle against 
them accordingly. No country in Europe is able to master this 
growing danger on its own. 
  In the interests of our citizens we want open borders in 
Europe. However, this must not go hand in hand with a loss in 
internal security. With Europol we have taken a first step 
toward pursuing the struggle against international organized 
crime together and with determination. In talking with my 
European colleagues, I emphatically express the conviction that 
the instruments of the Maastricht Treaty are not yet sufficient. 
Beyond them, we must think about what we can do specifically -- 
not least on the basis of the experiences gathered by the U.S. 
authorities -- in combating organized crime and the drug mafia. 
  Third: In particular from the German viewpoint, the 
development of a common foreign and security policy is an 
existential question. We have more neighbors than any other 
country in Europe. We have lived in peace for 48 years now, but 
it would be a fateful error to believe that this is guaranteed 
for eternity. The evil spirits of the past are not only alive 
in the Balkans. 
  We need Europe's political unification so as to prevent any 
relapse into the national rivalries of former times. Some sort 
of elevated free-trade zone is not sufficient for this purpose. 
War and peace in Europe depend on whether we manage to build 
this "European home" firmly, so that it can weather any storm 
and cannot be destroyed anymore. 
  In the future, the Europeans can only master the great 
foreign and security policy challenges together. The war in the 
former Yugoslavia, not least, has demonstrated the current 
limits of the European Community in crisis prevention and crisis 
management. For two years, we have seen the terrible pictures 
of the suffering people in Sarajevo and elsewhere on the 
television news every evening. What is at stake here is the 
credibility of the European democracies. 
  In many countries -- also in Germany -- the efforts to end 
the conflict are considered to be insufficient. In view of the 
horrible pictures in the areas of war, many people ask whey the 
West and, in particular, NATO are not doing more to end the 
conflict. I have much understanding for these questions. 
However, here one forgets how much this war is characterized by 
hatred and irrationality, which have grown over centuries. 
  In reality, there is no omnipotent prescription for solving 
this conflict. We Germans in particular should be especially 
careful with our advice. We do not have the moral right to 
demand more of those responsible in other countries than we 
ourselves do. Rather, we should express respect for those young 
soldiers, and their relatives, who risk their lives and work 
there for the United Nations. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, a common foreign and security policy 
of the European Union would remain piecemeal if European defense 
were not added. The WEU [Western European Union] has a key role 
in this. Atlantic alliance and European defenses must 
supplement and strengthen each other meaningfully. In this 
connection, it was a great success of the latest NATO summit in 
Brussels that cooperation between NATO and the European Union 
will be essentially expanded. In the future, the WEU will be 
able to use NATO forces for its own mission. At the same time, 
the Eurocorps, which was established by President Mitterrand and 
myself, will soon be available for the common defense of the 
alliance, for peacekeeping missions, and for humanitarian tasks. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, we want to build this Europe as a 
Europe of the people. This Europe is to be a federal construct. 
Federal means that the authority and decisionmaking power lies 
there where the decision can best be made. In case of doubt, 
this is at the level that is closer to the citizens. 
  Only those things that really have to be decided there are 
to 
be decided in Brussels. Some EC guidelines are certainly 
superfluous. However, for the sake of fairness, one must also 
admit that many of these guidelines are due to initiatives of 
national interest groups. Therefore, Ladies and Gentlemen, a 
year ago in Edinburgh we decided to establish criteria and 
control mechanism so as to make such developments impossible in 
the future. 
  We do not want to build a European superstate, we want a 
European community, a "European home," in which people feel 
comfortable and in which many things will remain different. 
This Europe is not to have a uniformly gray facade, but all the 
facets and the entire wealth of colors, the entire colorful 
bouquet of Europe is to become visible. In the Europe of the 
future, we will remain Germans, Britons, Italians, or French. 
We remain firmly rooted in our home regions. In this sense, 
Maastricht does not stand for a European leviathan, but for a 
decentralized and democratic Europe that is close to the people. 
In particular, the variety of the peoples in Europe offers the 
preconditions for a synthesis that links the best qualities of 
the peoples. Europe's strength lies in the fruitful 
relationship of tension between the unity and lively variety of 
our cultural heritage. 
  In this connection, it must also be noted that the European 
Union, as it now stands, is only a torso. I hope that in 1995, 
Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will join the European 
Union as planned. Certainly, there are still difficulties in 
the current negotiations. However, we must try to follow the 
difficult path in the future together. Just as the accession of 
the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states is a natural 
part of the development of the European Union, in my view, it 
would be unacceptable for me, if, in the long run, the border of 
the political union were to remain the Oder-Neisse border. 
Therefore, at the European Council in Copenhagen last June, we 
also opened up clear prospects for membership to our eastern 
neighbors. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, I know we are facing enormous tasks in 
Europe. I know that one could despair because of that. 
However, I also know that it is not the business of one single 
generation, but these are tasks of generations -- still, we can 
make progress in Europe. This path has brought us much 
happiness. It has brought German unification. 
  When we now say in the spirit of Thomas Mann: "We are German 
Europeans and European Germans," then this is a wonderful thing 
for the future -- to be able to live in freedom and in peace! 
We can do something with a view to the hopes of large parts of 
the Third World, Latin America, Asia, and Africa, those 
countries and peoples who have not only experienced good things 
from Europe, but also many unpleasant things in the course of 
their history. 
  We must make wealth of cultural assets, of intellectual 
developments of the most varied kind usable. It is a very 
essential basis of human creativity, and thus also a basis for 
political and economic success. I believe that we should think 
primarily of the next, the young generation, and act in its 
spirit. Young people in Germany -- that is you, who are 
studying here -- have the opportunity to live in peace and 
freedom in the future, a bit of luck that no other generation in 
Germany has ever had. However, we must also do something for 
that. 
  Today, we have the opportunity to link up with good 
traditions -- from that time before the era of nation-state 
rivalries -- when one began one's studies in Oxford, for 
instance, continued them in Bologna, and then went to Paris. 
  You, dear students, live a life in Europe already, now, that 
we want to achieve for tomorrow: a continent of open borders, 
of good neighborliness, and friendship. What is needed is your 
initiative, your creative intelligence, your self-confidence, 
and also your ability to make a contribution to the future of 
our country and of Europe. 
  In particular, I address you, the students, because actually 
it is rather more your Europe of which I am speaking than mine. 
When your are 63 or 64 years old, you naturally think of how 
much time you still have. You think differently than the 
20-year-old student I was in 1950. But I remember one thing, 
namely that we were a generation that was confident it could 
build this Europe. 
  Therefore, there is no reason for that cultural pessimism 
that is, unfortunately, paid for highly in Germany. I feel 
primarily gratitude that in my generation it has been possible 
to continue the work of the wonderful founders of the FRG. 
  Europe -- that is the future that I wish for us. In 
particular, however, for you, the students.

<F P=106> [Article by Rory Watson: "Malta Stakes Early Claim to Union"] </F>
  [Text] As the European Union [EU] struggles to complete 
accession negotiations which will raise its numbers from 12 to 
16, it is already facing impatient demands to open similar talks 
with Malta. 
  In a concerted public opinion campaign, the Maltese 
government is trying to persuade the EU to give the green light 
at its Corfu summit in June for the talks to begin. That 
message will be given loud and clear to members of the European 
Parliament when they visit Malta next week. It follows a 
vigorous diplomatic offensive by the prime minister, Dr Edward 
Fenech Adami, on a visit to Brussels on 2 February. 
  The Maltese government believes public opinion in the EU is 
moving its way. But they are likely to find that while there is 
appreciation of the economic reforms now under way to prepare 
the country for membership, the EU does not want to be pushed 
into negotiations. 
  "It is still too early. There is no question of us putting 
together a negotiating mandate this year. I think we would 
rather look at this early next year," said one senior EU source, 
confirming the opinion of the commissioner in charge of 
enlargement talks, Hans van den Broek, that reforms must be 
carried out before formal negotiations can begin. 
  It is hardly surprising that the Maltese government is 
pushing for entry. The policy has been the main thrust of 
Fenech Adami's ruling Nationalist Party since it was elected to 
office in 1987, and it is politically important that it be seen 
to be delivering before the next elections, possibly in 1996. 
Last week Fenech Adami stressed Malta's European affiliations. 
  "If Malta had been an independent state immediately after 
the 
Second World War, we would have been, no doubt, among the 
founding members of the European Community," he suggested. Many 
question whether the Union can accommodate Malta slightly larger 
than Luxembourg and with a population of 380,000 -- without a 
significant institutional upheaval. 
  To such sceptics, Fenech Adami replies: "My view is that 
Europe has institutional problems. But this should not be an 
obstacle to starting negotiations, especially with Malta. We 
should be treated on our own merits." 
  Malta is at pains to stress the pace of economic reform it 
has set in train. By Easter it will have tabled at least 16 
bills in areas ranging from financial services to consumer 
protection. From next January its fiscal system will be fully 
in line with that of the Union. 
  But the government may well find itself under pressure to 
liberalise a number of state-controlled companies which enjoy 
monopolistic powers over the production of fresh milk (Malta 
Dairy Products), importation of cereals (Medigrain Ltd), the 
country's only casino (Casma Ltd) and ferry services (Gozo 
Channel). 
  Demands are coming from consumers who believe they will 
benefit from greater competition and from a number of companies 
who are confident they can operate more efficiently and 
profitably in these areas. The Gozo Channel's monopoly on 
ferrying passengers and cargo between Malta and Gozo has sparked 
off a fierce debate in the country's media. The company has 
successfully objected to a licence being given to any competitor.

<F P=106> [Report by EC correspondent Boris Johnson: "Euro ID Card on </F>
Brussels Agenda"] 
  [Text] Britons may be issued compulsory European ID cards 
as part of the new Maastricht programme of police and judicial 
co-operation if ideas under consideration by Brussels come into 
force. 
  With "Europol" due to be formally opened this Friday [18 
February] in The Hague as the prototype of a federal EC police 
force, a range of secretive Brussels committees is considering 
how to pool national information on everything from terrorism to 
traffic offences to divorce settlements. 
  According to a confidential action plan already agreed by 
the 
12 governments, Europol's remit is to expand from monitoring the 
drugs trade to dealing with illegal immigrants, pollution and 
traffickers in stolen cars, works of art and nuclear materials. 
  The latest European plans go further still, considering ways 
of enforcing driving bans and chasing fathers for maintenance 
payments across the continent. 
  According to a leaked "priority action plan," a working 
party 
of interior ministry officials is investigating "harmonising the 
conditions for combating illegal immigration and illegal 
employment" -- a reference to the personal identification cards 
used in most EC countries. 
  British officials acknowledged last night that the 
discussion 
was going ahead. But despite recent reports that Mr Major was 
attracted to the ID scheme, sources said the conclusions would 
not be binding on British ministers. 
  They said the aim of the discussion was to "share best 
practice" across the EC. "We'll be looking at those who find 
carrying ID cards beneficial," said a source. 
  In countries such as Belgium it is an offence punishable by 
imprisonment not to be carrying an ID card at all times. 
  At the centre of these plans is a "European Information 
System," due to be running by the end of the year. 
  This potentially vast data bank is the subject of acute 
controversy, with Denmark leading calls for privacy to be 
respected. The convention establishing it has yet to be settled. 
  The Government, strongly supported by Germany, sees 
European-wide co-operation as the best means of tackling 
cross-frontier crime. 
  The plan's main purpose is to launch a clampdown on 
criminals, illegal immigrants and bogus asylum-seekers. It 
envisages a European archive of images of forged documents, a 
European inventory of terrorist acts, a European data-collection 
system on criminal methods and new measures against "drugs 
tourism" and prostitution rings. 
  One group of 12 national experts is even looking at ways of 
increasing co-operation on government phone-tapping and other 
forms of "electronic interception." 
  Another group has been charged with finding a way of 
communicating driving bans to other police forces. It is due to 
report by June. 
  A group is also looking at ways of extending the Brussels 
Convention on enforcing court judgments to include "family 
matters and succession." It would ensure that maintenance 
awards can be enforced in all 12 EC countries.

<F P=106> [Article signed MPN/RAY: "`Ultimatum: NATO Will Not Accept </F>
Any Compromise,' Says Claes;" as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 10 Feb (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Claes said Thursday [10 February] that, as announced, NATO will 
attack Serbian military positions in Bosnia as soon as the 
10-day ultimatum expires if Serbia does not withdraw its 
artillery 20 km from Sarajevo. 
  In an interview with RTL-TVI [Luxembourg Radio and 
Television] Television, Mr. Claes added that even partial 
withdrawal of the artillery less than 20 km will not weaken NATO 
determination to launch air strikes against Serbian positions. 
  Mr. Claes said that "any change of decision was out of 
question." 
  "This time, they will have to withdraw beyond 20 km or NATO 
will implement its plan," Claes added. 
  "I am convinced that this firm attitude has to be 
maintained... this time the Serbs will have to withdraw, so I do 
not rule out the possibility of reinforcing the ground troops. I 
still believe, however, that like good old Communists, they only 
understand harsh language and that military actions will not be 
necessary," Mr. Claes said. 
  Furthermore, Mr. Claes said he totally agreed with the 
statement that NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner made on 
Wednesday when he called the NATO decision a "historic moment." 
  "This shows that the Americans and the Europeans are once 
more on the same wavelength...this shows that even the Berlin 
Wall has fallen, NATO still has an important role to play in the 
future," concluded Mr. Claes.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "Ultimatum -- Only Butrus-Ghali Can </F>
Oppose Action by NATO;" as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 10 Feb (BELGA) -- [passage omitted] 
Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes rejected the arguments put 
forward by Russia, which is of the opinion that NATO could not 
resort to air strikes in Bosnia without another resolution being 
passed by the UN Security Council. 
  According to a spokesman for the Belgian Foreign Ministry, 
Mr. Claes believes "the debate is closed," and that the NATO 
decision constitutes a response to a request made by the United 
Nations. "Moscow duly went along with the relevant Security 
Council resolutions (Resolutions 824 and 836 -- BELGA database 
editor's note) which provide for the possibility of military 
actions in Bosnia," was the message brought across by Mr. Claes, 
as quoted by the spokesman. 
  Furthermore, in an interview given to the television channel 
RTL-TVI [Luxembourg Radio and Television], the Belgian foreign 
minister pointed out that a partial withdrawal of Serbian 
artillery less than 20 km from Sarajevo would not alter NATO's 
willingness to launch attacks against Serbian positions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Politically, `The Trigger </F>
Has Been Pulled,' Says Italy's Andreatta"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome, 10 Feb (ANSA) -- The political process 
concerning Bosnia has now been concluded within the NATO 
framework; it is now up to the military commands to carry out 
the decisions taken with no further political debate, with the 
exception of "contact" with the United Nations 
secretary-general, according to Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta Thursday [10 February] evening. 
  Summing up a diplomatic marathon which ended with a meeting 
of the Atlantic Council in Brussels Wednesday, Andreatta said 
that on a political level one could say that "the trigger has 
been pulled." This is the only way to see to it that the 
cannons and heavy arms surrounding Sarajevo are eliminated, 
Andreatta told the Senate foreign affairs committee this evening. 
  When a Communist Refoundation [Communist Renewal] spokesman 
objected to his reference to a pulled trigger, Andreatta said if 
ever there was an occasion in which the arms of the European 
Union and of NATO could be used for a universal goal of 
international justice it was the present need to lift the siege 
of Sarajevo. 
  Andreatta reported that he had sent a message to the U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher Monday in which the 
Italian position was reiterated. Italy is convinced of the 
urgent need to stop the lethal shelling of Sarajevo and backs 
the idea of using air power to force the withdrawal of all heavy 
artillery from the hills around the city, he stressed. 
Nevertheless, the basic goal is to issue a stern warning to all 
sides to go all out to find a negotiated solution to the 
conflict in Bosnia, he said. 
  The Croatians must exercise the greatest flexibility when it 
comes to ensuring the Muslims access to the sea and Zagreb must 
"without delay" proceed to the withdrawal of its military forces 
from Bosnia, he said. Andreatta remains convinced that an 
agreement between the Croatians and the Muslims is fundamental 
to reaching any overall agreement on Bosnia. 
  The Italian foreign minister also insisted on the need for 
greater involvement on the part of the United States, Russia and 
the Islamic countries. He felt that Russian reservations about 
the "juridicial legitimacy" of any UN request for intervention 
in Bosnia, were too narrow. Andreatta also urged that the 
United States throw its full support between the European 
Union's action plan. 
  U.S. Secretary of Defense William J. Perry today contacted 
Italian Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri by telephone to discuss 
the Bosnian crisis following the NATO decision to put a halt to 
the siege of Sarajevo. The two sides confirmed their 
determination to follow up on actions agreed upon along with the 
United Nations. Italy would provide logistical support for NATO 
air forces standing ready to carry out missions in Bosnia. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Vatican daily OSSERVATORE ROMANO said that the West's 
commitment relaunched concrete prospects for an accord and 
offered concrete hope to the people of Sarajevo. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Andreatta Proposes Florence </F>
Parley To Butrus-Ghali"] 
  [Text] Rome, 14 Feb (ANSA) -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta has proposed, via letter, to United Nations 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the latter convene 
"an operational meeting" in Florence to examine action plans for 
new humanitarian interventions in Bosnia. 
  As to Sarajevo, in particular, the letter went on to say, 
such initiatives would be aimed at moving forward in time the 
administration of the city by the United Nations so that the 
"dramatic social problems" there could be dealt with 
internationally, as envisaged in the European Union [EU] peace 
plan. 
  The contents of the letter were made known in a communique 
released here today by the Farnesina (foreign ministry). 
Andreatta wrote that in Bosnia, from a humanitarian point of 
view, solutions complementary to those of the UN and of the EU 
should be quickly developed. He suggested, for example, that UN 
troops might be assigned to more strictly humanitarian tasks 
such as medical and health assistence, and that an all-out 
effort be made to "immediately" get schools reopened and to 
create safe centers for children, their mothers and the elderly. 
  He urged that attending this Florence conference should be 
those responsible for relevant international bodies such as 
UNHCR; UNICEF, the Red Cross and the World Health Organization; 
United States, Russian and European Community ministers in 
charge of humanitarian aid; the president of the Conference of 
Islamic States, and the Nobel Peace Prize laureates of recent 
years. 
  In the text of his letter, Andreatta quoted Holocaust 
survivor and writer Primo Levi who said that "if we are in a 
position to alleviate suffering and fail to do so, we ourselves 
become torturers." 
  Ever since the very start of this tragedy, Italy has given 
wholehearted support to those specialized agencies responsibile 
for humanitarian actions which have carried out, "with admirable 
dedication", the tough job of alleviating the suffering of civil 
populations in that part of the Balkans, the letter continued. 
It is now necessary to build on the growing public awareness of 
the tragedy, coming up with viable and effective solutions and 
putting them into practice, Andreatta said. 
  An immediate program of support for social health and 
education services could be quickly set up and made operative in 
the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, for example; a program 
free from any sort of ethnic or religious discrimination, the 
Italian foreign minister said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Negotiation Only Way to </F>
True Peace, Italy Tells UN"] 
  [Excerpt] New York, 14 Feb (ANSA) -- Durable peace in 
Bosnia can only be achieved through negotiations which reach an 
overall and just agreement between all parties involved, Italy's 
ambassador to the United Nations, Francesco Paolo Fulci, said 
during the marathon session of the United Nations Security 
Council here on the Balkan conflict. 
  Ambassador Fulci went on to argue how an eventual air-strike 
in and around Sarajevo, if the siege of the Bosnian capital is 
not removed by February 20, "should not be viewed exclusively as 
an act of reprisal or a response to the deadlock in the peace 
process, but as a means to induce the sides to return to reason 
and make every effort possible to come to an agreement." The 
Italian diplomat then went on to stress the importance of 
Italy's active role in the adoption of the ultimatum which 
represented the "point of change in the attitude of the 
international community towards the crisis in Bosnia" and a 
"catalyst for new contributions in the search for a political 
solution." 
  In his address, Ambassador Fulci reiterated how Italy has 
put 
its military bases and airports at the full disposition of the 
Atlantic Alliance for any action in Bosnia. 
  The Italian ambassador concluded by making a host of 
appeals, 
asking that opposing forces in Bosnia "exercise moderation and 
demonstrate political will to reach a negotiated settlement," 
extending this plea to "anyone who can influence the warring 
factions with renewed vigor." He then called on those countries 
participating in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] contingent, 
humanitarian organizations, international agencies and "all men 
of good will" to not waiver in their efforts. "A peaceful 
solution for Bosnia can be found" Ambassador Fulci said, "but 
only if we all persevere." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by European editor David Marsh: "EBRD To Boost Local </F>
Presence"] 
  [Text] The European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development [EBRD] intends to increase its staff in East Europe 
and the former Soviet Union by about half in an attempt to bring 
its services closer to potential customers. 
  The move to raise by 20 the EBRD's expatriate and locally 
hired employees in its 11 offices outside London forms part of a 
decentralisation strategy being implemented by Mr Jacques de 
Larosiere, the EBRD president. 
  Mr de Larosiere believes the bank lacks the flexibility and 
on-the-ground presence to respond quickly to emerging business 
opportunities, especially with smaller enterprises. 
  As a result, the bank wants to recruit relatively young 
people with experience in East Europe. "We want people who can 
make deals," one bank official said. 
  The official added that the changes, which have been 
discussed with the bank's directors and senior management in 
recent weeks, would take time to implement. "We cannot change 
direction in a few months." 
  The decentralisation plan would be backed by a more 
effective 
system of communication between the regional offices and the 
London headquarters. 
  The move is in line with the restructuring of EBRD's 
operations decided in November to make the bank less 
bureaucratic. 
  Mr de Larosiere took over at the end of September after Mr 
Jacques Attali was forced to resign following widespread 
criticism of the bank's overspending on its London office and 
relatively low disbursements of funds for East Europe. 
  Since taking over, Mr de Larosiere has launched a programme 
to reduce costs and refocus the bank's priorities. 
  During the second half of last year, the EBRD stepped up 
disbursements of loans and equity to the former communist bloc. 
Some of these increased pay-outs were already planned before Mr 
Attali left in July. 
  At end-December 1993, disbursements stood at ECU556 million, 
out of approved projects of ECU3.8 billion and signed 
commitments of ECU2.8bn. This compares with disbursements of 
ECUl26m at the end of 1992 and ECU244m last June. 
  The EBRD's aim is to increase by five the bank's complement 
of around 20 London-hired employees in its outside offices. A 
further 15 will be added to the tally of 20 local staff. 
  Seven of the offices are in former communist countries in 
Central and East Europe, with the biggest in Warsaw, Prague and 
Budapest. The rest are in Moscow and other parts of the 
ex-Soviet union. 
  The new posts will be offset by reductions in jobs at the 
EBRD's London headquarters in line with an overall freeze on 
hiring since Mr de Larosiere's arrival.

<F P=106> [Article signed NN/HS: "Informal Meeting of EU </F>
Transportation Ministers: Debate on 40-tonne Trucks With 
Switzerland Resumed"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Athens, 7 Feb (ATS) -- The European Union (EU) 
transportation ministers met on Monday [14 February] in Athens. 
During the informal Council, they assessed the state of the 
negotiating mandate with Switzerland. The European ministers 
feel in particular that "the debate on the issue of the transit 
of Community vehicles weighing more than 28 tonnes must be 
resumed." 
  The draft negotiating mandate drawn up by the Commission in 
Brussels on 16 September will be submitted for the approval of 
the Twelve by 18 April, said European Transportation 
Commissioner Abel Matutes. The Greek minister said there was 
"clear resistance from Switzerland concerning the transit 
problem and the problem of flexibility regarding the matter of 
the 40-tonne trucks." 
  "However," continued the Greek minister, "Switzerland's 
presence in the European Economic Area [EEA] is absolutely 
essential." According to him, "the issue must be revitalized and 
a standstill must be avoided." "We therefore endeavored," he 
concluded, "to select the positive points where there is a 
convergence of views in order to resume the dialogue with 
Switzerland so that the geographical area of Switzerland would 
indeed become an integral part of the EEA." 
  Most of the participants in Athens asked Switzerland to 
relax 
its regulations in order to make it possible to increase the 
number of trucks that benefit from an exception to the 40-tonne 
trucks. For Greece, which is currently EU president, Bern must 
make concessions. In Swiss diplomatic circles in Athens, the 
emphasis is being placed on participants' desire to avoid a 
confrontation with Bern. 
<H5>  Negotiating Mandate </H5>
  "I am completely in favor of resolving the Swiss issue once 
and for all," the European transportation commissioner told ATS. 
"Today, I noted the willingness of all the member states to 
conclude the matter and to give the Commission the negotiating 
mandate for a transportation agreement with Switzerland." 
  In September, the European Commission proposed draft 
negotiating guidelines. According to this text, the negotiations 
should mainly pursue two objectives: obtaining more openness 
from Switzerland for European trucks weighing 40 tonnes, and 
facilities for Alpine transit. In exchange, Swiss airlines and 
long distance trucks will be able to gain access to the European 
transportation market. 
  For the EU, the sectorial negotiations with Switzerland are 
part of an overall approach. The negotiators will have to seek 
out a balance on a sector-by-sector basis, as well as globally. 
It is understood that a transportation agreement will only be 
able to enter into force at the same time as an agreement on the 
free movement of workers.

<F P=106> [Article signed YR/NB: "Transit Traffic. Austria Seeks </F>
Agreement With Switzerland by End of Year"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 8 Feb (ATS) -- Austrian Public Economy and 
Transportation Minister Viktor Klima announced in Brussels on 
Tuesday [8 February] that Austria wants to sign an agreement on 
road transit traffic with Switzerland before the end of the 
year. This agreement will subject Swiss trucks transiting 
through Austria to the ecopoints [ecological points] system that 
exists for all European Union [EU] countries. 
  A spokesman for the minister said that the number of 
ecopoints granted to Switzerland will be calculated on the basis 
of transportation statistics. He added that Austria expects the 
discussions with Switzerland that are due to begin soon to go 
smoothly. 
  The conclusion of an agreement between Austria and 
Switzerland on transit traffic is one the Twelve's requirements 
before Austria can join the EU. Currently, the only trucks that 
are completely free to circulate in Austria are Swiss. 
  They avoid both the ecopoints system, to which European 
Community trucks are subjected by application of the Austria-EC 
transit agreement, and the quota system which is the rule for 
other third countries. The Twelve consider that this situation 
discriminates against Community trucks and they want it brought 
to an end. 
  While the Switzerland-EC transit agreement is aimed at 
protecting the environment and regulating transit traffic by 
applying the 28 tonne limit, the Austria-EC agreement 
established a system of ecopoints. The Twelve receive an annual 
amount of ecopoints which are used up as the trucks enter 
Austria and according to the pollution rating of the vehicles. 
<H5>  Vienna Rejects Twelve's Other Proposals </H5>
  While it is ready to end this discrimination favoring 
Switzerland, on Tuesday Austria rejected the other EC demands 
concerning road traffic. Negotiations will continue at the 
ministerial level on 21 and 25 February. 
  The first point of disagreement concerns the future of the 
transit agreement that came into effect a year ago. As far as 
Vienna is concerned, this agreement applies for the whole of its 
planned duration, that is until 2004, and is not to be abolished 
three years after Austria joins the EU as the EU claims. 
  According to the Austrian government, the most important 
thing is to reach the objectives of the transit agreement, but 
these objectives -- the protection of the environment (reduction 
of pollution emissions by 60 percent) and the orientation of 
transport (creation of an effective alternative between road and 
rail) -- will not have been achieved after three years. 
  The EU, however, maintains that no such bilateral agreement 
can continue to exist after the country has become a member. At 
most, its key points can be retained in a temporary arrangement 
for a limited duration. After that, a solution would have to be 
found at the Community level and this has yet to be debated. 
<H5>  Traffic Diverted Because of Swiss Restrictions </H5>
  Vienna also refuses to lift its 38-tonne limit, which allows 
it to exert "a little pressure" in favor of rail. This means of 
dissuasion would disappear with the harmonization with European 
standards which already cater for an increase to 44 tonnes. 
  To defend its position, Austria points out the restrictions 
imposed by Switzerland, namely the 28 tonne limit and the ban on 
night driving. These restrictions mean that heavy goods 
vehicles avoid the shortest route -- cutting through Switzerland 
-- and instead take a detour through France and Austria. Vienna 
calculates that 40 percent of the traffic transiting through 
Austria is therefore "diverted traffic."

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/108: "Commission Confirms There </F>
Is No Delay in Eastern Nuclear Safety Projects"] 
  [Text] Ensuring the safety of nuclear reactors in Russia, 
the Ukraine and parts of East Europe continues to be one of the 
top priorities of the European Commission's assistance program, 
PHARE [Economic recovery project for Poland and Hungary] and 
TACIS [Technical assistance to CIS]. These safety programs, 
which are in the interests of both the local populations and of 
West Europe, have led the Commission to commit ECU275 million 
for a variety of projects including the sending of EU nuclear 
experts on permanent on-site missions at six Russian and two 
Ukrainian plants. 
  Since the beginning of this and other international 
assistance programs, the question of liability in the case of 
accidents has been an issue. Internationally the Paris and 
Vienna Conventions deal with the question of liability by making 
the country where the plants are located responsible in the case 
of accidents. Neither Russia nor the Ukraine are members of 
these conventions. In order to allow their safety programs to 
move forward, the main international donors such as the EU and 
the United States have negotiated arrangements to cover 
liability with the Russian authorities. 
  For example, U.S. Vice President Gore reached an agreement 
with the Russian authorities during his December 1993 visit to 
Moscow. In the summer of 1993 the European Commission arranged 
with the Russian authorities that Russia would accept liability 
for all TACIS projects currently underway. 
  Therefore, contrary to press reports today, there is no 
delay 
in the projects which were launched in 1993. These are 
proceeding according to plan. However, the current EU-Russia 
arrangements do not cover the next stage in the program which 
will include the supply and installation of hardware. Therefore 
the Commission has been negotiating with the relevant 
authorities in order to extend the areas for which they will be 
responsible. The position of the Commission is that the Russian 
authorities should accept liability for work carried out in 
their plants since this is international practice and will 
become the rule as soon as Russia and Ukraine join the Paris and 
Vienna conventions. The Russian authorities are currently 
considering a proposal tabled by the Commission in Moscow at the 
beginning of February. This proposal was discussed yesterday 
with the European industry. 
  The Commission is keeping in close contact with other 
international donors such as the United States and the 
multilateral nuclear safety fund set up on the initiative of the 
G-7 in order to find an acceptable solution to this problem of 
liability.

<F P=106> [Article signed DGO/LVE: "House of Representatives -- The </F>
Safety of UN Troops"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 10 Feb (BELGA) -- Every possible step has 
been taken to ensure the safety of the Belgian troops currently 
deployed in the former Yugoslavia under the flag of the United 
Nations, stated Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix on 
Thursday afternoon [10 February] during question time in the 
House of Representatives. 
  Mr. Delcroix, who was responding to a question asked by 
Jacques Devolder of the VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats], 
underlined that British General Michael Rose, commander in chief 
of the UN troops, was the man primarily responsible for the 
safety of Belgian troops. 
  "We are not intervening directly to specify what the troops 
belonging to the Belgian contingent should do there. However, 
this does not mean that we are not concerned for their safety. 
Moreover, we are making recommendations on this subject to our 
commanders on the ground," he said. Nonetheless, the minister 
did not want to provide any further details on the content of 
these measures. 
  Meanwhile, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes reiterated 
that air strikes would be ordered if the Bosnian Serbs failed to 
comply with the ultimatum imposed on them by NATO on Wednesday 
evening, and which expires in 10 days. 
  The foreign minister, replying to a question asked by Dirk 
Van Der Maelen of the SP [Flemish Socialist Party], duly 
confirmed that NATO would remain intransigent if the Serbs 
neglected to meet all the conditions laid down in the ultimatum. 
The ultimatum calls for the Serbs to withdraw their artillery 
to a distance of 20 km from Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Article signed (RKX): "Claes: Presence of Belgians in </F>
Serbia `Not A Major Problem'"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 13 Feb (BELGA) -- The presence of Belgians 
in Serbia does not constitute a major or immediate problem, 
Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes stated on Sunday [13 
February] during a BRT [Dutch-language Belgian radio and 
Television] discussion program "The Seventh Day." 
  Minister Claes indicated that after the announcement of 
sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, Belgian diplomatic 
staff in Belgrade had already been reduced to a strict minimum. 
The only remaining staff in the Serbian capital are a 
chancellor, a charge d'affaires, and a telex operator. The 
families of diplomats have also already been advised to leave. 
  Minister Claes also said that he saw no immediate danger for 
Belgian civilians in Serbia. This concerns just a small number 
of people, most of whom have dual nationality. The Belgian 
foreign minister did announce, however, that Belgium and the 
other EU member states will be discussing further measures 
concerning foreigners in Yugoslavia next Wednesday. 
  Unlike the United States, Great Britain, and the 
Netherlands, 
France also is not thinking of evacuating its citizens from 
Belgrade, said French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Sunday 
during a visit to Jordan. 
  During the television debate, Minister Claes said that he 
believed that it would not be necessary for NATO to carry out 
its threat to bomb Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
Serbs and Moscow have both understood the situation, said the 
minister, who believed that Moscow and Belgrade will be exerting 
sufficient pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to ensure that they 
comply with the NATO ultimatum. 
  Claes stated that the NATO ultimatum also formed an 
excellent 
basis for further negotiations. The discussion as to whether to 
send more and better armed ground troops to Bosnia -- as 
proposed by Mark Heirman of the CIP [Press Information Center] 
-- was not urgent or, above all, feasible, stated Claes. Claes 
asked who would be required to supply such troops, as the United 
States refused to do so and Germany was prevented from doing so 
by its constitution. 
  Claes stated that as far as NATO and the United Nations were 
concerned, scenarios 1 and 2 currently apply to Bosnia. If the 
NATO ultimatum does not produce any results, then scenario 3 may 
be considered, namely the extension of NATO's field of action. 
Claes had no doubt that no further meeting of the UN Security 
Council was required in order to take any further decisions. 
NATO would simply have to consult with Secretary-General 
Butrus-Ghali, who, under Security Council Resolutions 824, 836, 
and 844, has "political authority" regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The foreign minister also said that at the moment there are 
no indications that Yugoslavia is planning reprisals in Belgium 
or any other country.

  [Text] New York (DPA) -- Germany advocates a "political 
solution" in the Bosnian conflict, but at the same time it has 
welcomed the NATO decision. It cannot be "considered as 
retaliation or as the desire for military action." It is part 
of a political process for a solution by negotiation. This was 
stated by German UN Ambassador Detlev Count Rantzau on Monday 
[14 February] at the emergency meeting of the UN Security 
Council on Bosnia in New York. If the unauthorized weapons 
systems have not been withdrawn within 10 days, the use of force 
is "unavoidable" in reestablishing peace. 
  NATO has threatened to carry out air strikes on the Serbian 
heavy weapons around Sarajevo if they are not withdrawn or put 
under UN supervision by 21 February. 
  The German UN ambassador referred to the latest massacre of 
innocent civilians in Sarajevo. "These crimes must stop," 
Rantzau demanded. Germany has made every effort to alleviate 
the suffering of the victims. Almost 400,000 refugees have 
found refuge in Germany, which is twice as many as in all other 
European countries together. According to Rantzau, German 
humanitarian aid amounts to 612 million marks. It is 
unacceptable that the relief convoys are constantly hindered and 
helpers are threatened and attacked. 
  According to the UN ambassador, the Federal Government 
advocates a territorial solution, which ensures the physical and 
political survival of the Muslims as a nation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This implies, above all, a "satisfactory 
territorial solution," including access to the Sava river and to 
the sea. The town of Mostar should be put under the 
administration of the European Union. The German Government has 
offered to provide an administrator for Mostar. 
  The UN ambassador noted that Bonn supports further close 
cooperation between the United Nations and the European Union. 
The German government also welcomes an "active, strong role" by 
the United States. Russian support of the peace efforts will be 
of great importance. The peace negotiations in Geneva will be 
continued. They cannot be successful without the political will 
of the three parties to the conflict. One cannot find a 
political solution against their will. Germany will provide as 
much support as possible toward the efforts for peace and 
stability, the ambassador added.

time than we would have liked," the minister stressed. 
According to Wissmann, in the agreements reached so far U.S.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government is clearly 
not willing to make any concessions in the negotiations with the 
United States on an aviation agreement. At the moment, the 
issue is a "balancing" of the texts, Veit Steinle, spokesman of 
the FRG Transporation Ministry, stated in Bonn on Friday [11 
February] upon inquiry. If the U.S. side wants improvements in 
the agreement, the same must be done for Germany, too. It is 
necessary to keep a balance. 
  Gemany is trying to end the negotiations without "excitement 
and panic." This is being done in the closest coordination with 
the Federal Government and Lufthansa, Steinle said. The talks 
with the U.S. company United Airlines on the contentious issue 
of code-sharing, which Lufthansa would like, will be continued 
in Washington on Friday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Strausberg (DPA) -- According to one of its 
commanders, the Bundeswehr in eastern Germany is not yet fully 
operational. The military and technical training of personnel 
taken over from the GDR National People's Army is insufficient, 
Major General Juergen Hoeche, commander of the Fifth Luftwaffe 
Division, said at a security policy conference in Strausberg 
near Berlin on Thursday [10 February]. 
  The eastern Luftwaffe is preparing for NATO integration, 
which can only take place in 1995 at the earliest, however. 
Then the acceding area will lose its special status, which was 
laid down in the Two-Plus-Four Treaty in 1990 and provided for a 
purely national defense structure. According to Hoeche, the 
Luftwaffe will only continue its operations on three of formerly 
40 GDR military airfields. 
  After the final withdrawal of the Russian Air Force, which 
the major general expects in July this year, low altitude 
flights can be carried out in the whole of eastern Germany. 
They still have to be coordinated with the Western Group of the 
Russian armed forces. On average, up to 30 low altitude flights 
per day will probably be carried out in the new laender, Hoeche 
said.

  [Text] Hamburg -- DPA has rejected the reproach of "news 
manipulation" leveled by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union) in a letter to the chief editor. 
He described a DPA report, according to which the strength of 
the Bundeswehr "will probably be reduced to 300,000 men" as 
"completely unfounded." However, the news agency confirmed today 
that it received the information from reliable sources. DPA 
reported that, because of the bad financial situation, it will 
not be possible to keep a strength of 370,000, as agreed between 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Former Soviet State President Mikhail 
Gorbachev in the Caucasus.

  [Text] According to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the new 
laender's catching-up process is progressing, but it could still 
be faster. "I stick to my flowering landscapes. But it will 
take somewhat longer than we originally expected," Kohl said at 
the annual reception of the Southwest Saxony Chamber of Commerce 
in Chemnitz on Friday [11 February]. 
  While investment is declining in western Germany, it is 
increasing sharply in the new laender. East German public and 
private per capita investment is already higher than the western 
German one. With these investments, together with 
future-oriented technology and know-how, eastern Germany creates 
opportunities for the whole of Germany, Kohl said. 
  Kohl called upon banks to get more involved in the 
construction of the east Germany economy. He deplored that they 
were only hesitatingly fulfilling their promise to participate 
in Trust Agency companies with 1 billion German marks [DM]. The 
insurance companies, on the other hand, have kept their promise 
to contribute DM1 billion. Kohl said that the banks should 
become more of a partner to small and medium-sized companies in 
eastern Germany and should take more account of the fact that 
the economy is still being developed when rating companies' 
creditworthiness. The people in the east have not had the 
opportunity to collect capital for 40 years in order to offer 
the securities that banks ask for today. 
  After the reception, Kohl discussed Chemnitz as an 
industrial 
location, unemployment, and vocational training with trade union 
representatives, representatives of the chamber, and Mayor Peter 
Seifert. A meeting was agreed on 2 March, where representatives 
of the Chancellor's Office and Chemnitz authorities will discuss 
a regional project to fight long-term unemployment.

  [Text] Bonn -- Against the background of token strikes in 
the metal industry, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday [8 
February] warned against strikes and lockouts. These old 
rituals are not the right answers to high German unemployment. 
Despite the 3 million jobs that were created in the old laender 
in the course of the 1980's, all of Germany is now some 5 
million competitive jobs short, the chancellor admitted at the 
beginning of a two-day forum on Germany as economic center in 
Petersberg near Bonn. In his address to eminent business and 
trade union representatives, who are participating in the forum 
that has been sponsored by the Economics Ministry, Kohl demanded 
that, in their negotiations, both sides of industry are focusing 
more strongly on the objective of jobs than in the past. 
  The conclusion of the agreement in the chemical industry is 
a 
right signal, Kohl said. Flexible corridors for working hours 
and special initial wages were taking the differing 
effectiveness of enterprises and employees into account. This 
would make the new employment of people easier, the chancellor 
noted. This example should be copied by other industries. The 
forum on Germany as industrial center was basically intended to 
deal with securing Germany's future, particularly the people's 
readiness to change their way of thinking, and also to 
facilitate the transformation process in the new laender. Kohl 
called for "general inventory of our society." The recession 
has bottomed out. It is not least the machine construction 
industry that signals the beginning of an upswing that is 
sustained by exports. 
  Kohl strongly appealed to the members of the mediating 
committee to reach an acceptable solution for nursing care 
insurance now. Even now, there are as many as 1.8 million acute 
cases of people that need nursing, which emphasizes the 
increasing urgency of such an insurance. Despite all 
differences of opinion regarding the details of the insurance, 
the Federal Government continues to reject any increase of the 
burden for the enterprises. 
  The forum is to continue on the basis of working groups, 
with 
special emphasis being placed on the reduction of bureaucracy 
and privatization, labor and social affairs, finances and taxes, 
and research and education. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, 
of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], intends to 
present the results of the closed meeting at a news conference 
on Wednesday.

  [Text] After over 10 hours, the top-level talks held in 
Darmstadt to avert strikes in the west German metal and 
electrical industries failed on Friday [11 February]. The 
representatives of the IG Metall trade union and the 
Gesamtmetall employers organization parted in the evening, 
without agreeing on a date for fresh talks. 
  Gesamtmetall's president, Hans-Joachim Gottschol, blamed the 
trade union for not accepting the employers' proposals on 
securing jobs. The employers had suggested opening up wage 
agreements, which would have allowed companies to increase work 
time to 40 hours, or decrease it below the current 36 hours per 
week on a temporary basis. IG Metall had rejected longer 
working hours and demanded wage compensations in the event of a 
shorter working week, which would be counterproductive on the 
labor market, Gottschol said.

  [Text] Mainz -- Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping has warned employers in Germany not to 
try and push through wage cuts, which would endanger the 
economic trend. "However nice the 10-percent wage cut suggested 
by the metal employers would be for companies costwise, the 
effects on demand would be catastrophic," the 
Rhineland-Palatinate minister president said in an interview 
with the German Press Agency (DPA) on Tuesday [8 February] 
evening. Such wage cuts "would kill off the economic cycle." 
  Cost cuts will have to be discussed, he said. "This is a 
political task, especially with ancillary wage costs." In the 
metalworkers' conflict a solution must be found at the 
negotiating table, Scharping pointed out. "I do not think that 
a strike would really help us now." But the appeal must first 
be directed at employers, "because the trade unions have stated 
very clearly that they are prepared to cut back a great deal in 
wage demands, if jobs are secured," he said. 
  He said he was also moved by the terrible pictures from 
Sarajevo, "but the latest figures by the Federal Employment 
Office, with 4 million unemployed, stir me as well." This 
"record high in unemployment in Germany's history is a worrying 
signal," he stressed. Internal peace in Germany is also 
endangered by the existing social contrasts. 
  What is also required now, Scharping said, is "the example 
from the elites." This could very well mean higher burdens on 
those earning higher incomes. In Bonn, an SPD government would 
also set examples by cutting down on the number of ministries 
and "especially the number of parliamentary state secretaries, 
whose jobs have become mere maintenance posts." 
  It is high time that the social problems in Germany, where 
as 
many as 10 million people live close to the subsistence level, 
are moved to the center of political debate. "We talk far too 
much about foreign policy, missions in war zones, or people's 
weariness of politics. People no longer concentrate on the 
essentials. With politicians permanently talking about old 
files and other marginal affairs, one must not be surprised that 
people are weary of politics." 
  In foreign policy there is no big difference of opinion 
between Helmut Kohl's government and the SPD, Scharping said. 
The only exception is the issue of Bundeswehr peacekeeping 
missions abroad. "There is no way the SPD will agree to such 
missions." 
  The SPD chairman was also skeptical about a military 
intervention in former Yugoslavia. "I do not think much of 
military intervention, this would only make the bloodshed worse. 
I consider a real enforcement of the economic blockade against 
Serbia to be the instrument that could still help today," 
Scharping said. 
  Regarding military interventions, the SPD feels more close 
to 
the United States' policy, "which is more cautious today than 
many a German Conservative." He said, "wanting to send troops to 
all parts of the world and wage war is dangerous talk." 
  The latest developments in former Yugoslavia do not change 
the government's and laender's intention to send Croat refugees 
back to their country, he said. "But this must go hand in hand 
with a reintegration program. Repatriation was intended from 
the beginning, why should it not take place?" the SPD Chairman 
said.

  [Text] The Transportation Ministry has rejected criticism 
of the planned Hamburg-Berlin Transrapid rail link that has been 
voiced by experts. The 13 economics professors of the 
Scientific Advisory Council are "no longer up to date on the 
current work," spokesman Veit Steinle said in Bonn on Thursday 
[10 February]. This regards the financing concept and capital 
resources of the operating companies. The Advisory Council has 
called the financing concept incomplete and the estimated cost 
of 8.9 billion marks, indicated by the Transport Ministry, 
unrealistic. 
  The spokesman said that Germany has not had the best of 
experiences in the transport sector. Putting into practice 
future-oriented technologies has become a crucial problem for 
Germany as a business location. The willingness of German 
Railways head Heinz Duerr to use the Transrapid is a clear sign 
of courage and risktaking. This does, however, not exclude 
sober evaluations, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Wiesbaden (DPA) -- FRG Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], considers the new 
asylum law, which has been in effect since July 1993, as a 
"great success, in particular also a success in humaneness." At 
a CDU symposium in Wiesbaden, Kanther reported on Friday [11 
February] that a direct comparison between the two halves of 
1993 shows that the number of asylum-seekers illegally smuggled 
into Germany went down from 30,000 by about 20,000. Thus, many 
who pay large sums of money to human traffickers only to be 
deported immediately upon their arrival in Germany have been 
spared great disappointment. 
  According to the interior minister, there is a close 
connection between the crime of trafficking in people, illegal 
border-crossings, and the above-average crime rate among illegal 
immigrants. He also sees a great problem in the illegal 
employment of illegal immigrants, Kanther said. "Illegal 
employment is not a minor offense, it is a very serious crime," 
he stressed. 
  The CDU politician also opposed the view that Germany has 
become an immigration country. The demand for an immigration 
law is absurd; anyone who claims that this could regulate the 
problem of immigration is just spreading "impractical chimeras" 
that cannot be used to solve practical problems. Political 
achievements must be measured by their results, Kanther said.

  [Text] Jerusalem (DPA) -- Deutsche Aerospace [Dasa] Chief 
Juergen Schrempp sees possibilities for more intensive 
cooperation between his corporation and the Israel high-tech and 
armament industry. Schrempp, who arrived in Jerusalem on Monday 
[14 February] for a brief talk with Israeli head of government 
Yitzhaq Rabin, told the press afterwards that both sides could 
benefit from such cooperation. 
  The Dasa chief had visited, among other things, the Israeli 
aviation corporation Israel Air Force Industries (IAI) and the 
armament company Rafael. He noted that the high-tech companies 
have excellent quality, which need not shy away from 
international comparison. Both sides would benefit from an 
exchange in the field of technology. As fields of cooperation 
he cited defense technology, satellite technology, and aircraft 
construction. Schrempp spoke of efforts by Airbus to sell planes 
to the Israeli El Al airline. Smaller planes could be of 
interest for El Al, if regional aviation becomes more important 
as a result of a stable peace in the Middle East. 
  In his talk with Schrempp, Rabin explained his government's 
interest in balancing the high deficit in his country's trade 
balance with Europe. However, politics can provide industry 
only with a framework, which then has to be fleshed out by the 
companies themselves, Rabin noted.

<F P=106> [Carmen Parra report: "Resounding Failure of Meeting </F>
Between Gonzalez and Workers Commissions and UGT Leaders"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Yesterday's Moncloa Palace summit was 
a resounding failure. The meeting between the prime minister 
and the UGT [General Workers Union] and Workers Commissions 
leaders confirmed that the government will not be offering 
compromises following the 27 January general strike. Felipe 
Gonzalez told Nicolas Redondo and Antonio Gutierrez directly the 
same thing that he had told them by letter: The negotiation on 
the labor reform will not be reopened, and he again referred 
them to an agreement with the CEOE [Spanish Confederation of 
Employers Organizations], which the latter has rejected. 
  Antonio Gutierrez and Nicolas Redondo did not conceal their 
tense faces following an hour and one-half meeting with the 
prime minister, which they described as "extremely serious." 
The Workers Commissions leader asserted that they went to the 
Moncloa Palace "devoid of any arrogant tone," and left with a 
"no" to their requests for negotiation. "There are several 
incomprehensible things which the country must know," Gutierrez 
asserted: "The prime minister is ignoring the strike: we came 
to discuss the labor reform, and he came out with the incomes 
agreement and does not wish to take part in the endeavor to 
extricate this country from the conflict." 
  The two trade unionists forecast a future of considerable 
tension in collective bargaining and in labor relations. They 
also made this known in these terms to the prime minister, to 
whom they also set out all their arguments for rejecting the 
labor reform, including the argument that "only time will tell 
whether these measures will create jobs." "We believe that they 
will not, and that employers will dismiss many workers," 
according to Nicolas Redondo. They also informed him of their 
refusal to be referred to a dialogue with the CEOE, when its 
leaders have refused to negotiate these measures with the trade 
unions. 
  The two trade union leaders met previously at midmorning in 
Redondo's office in order to prepare the messages that they were 
going to present to the prime minister. Their main aim was to 
prevent the Moncloa Palace meeting from becoming a mere 
"courtesy meeting," as it had been described by Marcos Pena, 
secretary general for employment and coordinator of the 33 
meetings held by the administration and the social agents 
between last July and November, at which no agreement was 
reached. The Workers Commissions and UGT top leaders asked 
Felipe Gonzalez for "some gesture" in order to restore the 
dialogue so that substantial changes can be made to the labor 
reform -- the catalyst of the general strike. 
<H5>  Method of Discussion </H5>
  The method of or framework for discussion is not the basic 
issue for the trade unions. They were seeking a direct dialogue 
with the government, although the parliamentary procedure is 
continuing its course, and in fact they will be holding contacts 
with the political groups in order to propose amendments to them. 
  Gutierrez and Redondo reminded the head of government that 
negotiation was possible on other laws which were passing 
through parliament: The Workers' Statute, the Organic Law on 
Trade Union Freedom, and the abortive Strike Law -- the first 
under a Union of the Democratic Center government and the other 
two in the Socialist period. 
  The prime minister's proposal for negotiating an incomes 
agreement was not accepted by the trade unionists, since they 
believed that it would be possible only if that agreement 
applied to all incomes -- wages and business incomes -- and if 
the government had provided some way to resolve the 
disagreements over the labor reform. 
  Antonio Gutierrez stated that they told the prime minister 
"what we have said so far, which is that the country is 
certainly in no mood for compliments or courtesies, but rather 
for becoming involved very seriously in resolving a grave social 
problem. I believe that the prime minister should regard this 
not only as a duty but also, if you press me, even as an honor. 
A head of government cannot alter the fact that this country 
has just experienced a general strike. He must consider how to 
resolve matters." 
<H5>  Difficult To Reconcile </H5>
  These assertions by the Workers Commissions leader are 
difficult to reconcile with the demand made by CEOE Chairman 
Jose Maria Cuevas to the head of government at a later meeting 
which had not ended when this issue went to press. Cuevas made 
it clear that the government must not backtrack on the labor 
reform. He also told him that the employers' confederation is 
not prepared to reopen the dialogue with the trade unions 
because it has already noted the enormous differences between 
them over the changes which should take place in labor 
relations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Luis R. Aizpeolea report: "Autonomy Front Reopens"] </F>
  [Text] The autonomy front is reopening. On the eve of the 
meeting Felipe Gonzalez and Generalitat [Basque autonomous 
government] Premier Jordi Pujol will be holding in order to 
examine the turnabout in autonomy demanded by Catalonia, other 
"fast track" autonomous communities have reacted by demanding a 
new boost to autonomy. This is the case with the governments of 
Navarre, Andalusia, and Galicia, which are demanding new 
responsibilities, in some cases going beyond the autonomy 
statutes themselves. 
  The finishing touch to this scene will be provided by 
Galician Xunta [autonomous government] Premier Manuel Fraga, who 
will meet with Gonzalez Thursday [3 February] in order to 
present to him his single administration plan. The situation 
worries the government, which lacks a clear stance on the new 
autonomy avalanche. 
  The announced meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol to discuss 
the turnabout in autonomy in Catalonia and the central 
government's decision to transfer a package of 20 areas of 
responsibility to the Basque government has encouraged other 
"fast track" autonomous communities to demand another boost. 
Last week, the government of Navarre, whose premier is Juan 
Cruz Alli of the Navarrese People's Union (UPN), sent the 
government a document in which it proposed the reopening of 
bilateral negotiations to give its community new 
responsibilities. Navarre's list of demands recalls the most 
substantial part of the package of responsibilities demanded by 
the Basque government. The transfers demanded by Alli include 
official credit, the Social Security funding system, the 
National Employment Institute, and the means of the 
administration of justice. A spokesman for the Navarre 
government told this newspaper that the responsibilities 
demanded "are contained in the improvement of the fuero 
[regional law code]." 
  The letter sent by the Navarrese government coincided with 
the visit to Felipe Gonzalez by Socialist Manuel Chaves, the 
premier of the Andalusian junta. The autonomy responsibilities 
demanded by Chaves, who is pressured by imminent elections, 
recall some of the proposals that Pujol announced he will submit 
to Gonzalez at their next meeting. They include public health 
funding, the coastline, and the reform of the state's peripheral 
administration. 
  But the finishing touch is provided this week by Galician 
Xunta Premier Manuel Fraga, with his meeting with Gonzalez next 
Thursday. Although the meeting's purpose is the European 
surcharge on the milk quota, Fraga will explain to Gonzalez his 
single administration proposal. According to a Xunta spokesman, 
the single administration plan -- a drastic reduction of the 
state's peripheral administration, with the abolition of civil 
governors and the concentration of power in the autonomous 
governments -- "is virtually complete." 
  To this move that has emerged among the "fast track" 
autonomous communities must be added the move by a "slow track" 
community such as Aragon, whose premier, Socialist Jose Marco, 
has announced the completion of the reform of the autonomy 
statute for April. 
  The new situation that has been created worries the 
government, which, two years after the signing of the autonomy 
pacts -- which place the "slow track" communities almost on a 
par with the "fast track" communities and whose process of 
transfers is taking place now -- is seeing the autonomy process 
being reopened by the "fast track" autonomous communities 
without there being a clear stance laid down by the government. 
  Over the past few years, the government has expressed its 
concern at the "fast track" communities' persistence in making a 
normal procedure out of an exceptional procedure, such as 
delegating exclusive state responsibilities to the autonomous 
communities contained in Article 150.2 of the Constitution. The 
current demands of the Basque, Navarrese, and Galician 
governments have recourse to this procedure, which in the 
opinion of government sources goes beyond the autonomy statutes. 
  Last week, Socialist Manuel Chaves made some points after 
meeting with Gonzalez. He condemned effecting the autonomy 
process by boosting one or several communities, and demanded a 
"harmonious and balanced process" involving all of them. He 
advocates setting up a conference of the 17 autonomous 
government premiers as a way to organize the autonomy process, a 
proposal which has been repeatedly delayed by the premiers of 
Catalonia and the Basque Country, who are in favor of a 
bilateral relationship with the central government. 
  The government has not yet commented on the new boost for 
autonomy. A government spokesman transferred the responsibility 
for the debate to the Spanish Socialist Workers Party Congress 
in mid-March. On that occasion, a report from the Basque 
Socialists suggesting an individual autonomy strategy with 
respect to the nationalist parties and proposing making progress 
in the complicated problem being created between each autonomous 
community's singularity and the balance between all of them will 
be debated.

<F P=106> [Copyrighted article by correspondents A. Diez and L.R. </F>
Aizpeolea: "Gonzalez Convinced That He Can Count on Pujol's 
Support To Govern Through 1996"] 
  [Text] Head of government Felipe Gonzalez is convinced he 
has assured the survival of his government for the next two 
years by obtaining a commitment from the Convergence and Union 
(CiU) coalition to lend its support in parliament to the PSOE 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in the 1995 budget battle. 
CiU's backing would absolutely guarantee the Socialist cabinet's 
staying power. In the next 10 days, with the general strike 
over, Felipe Gonzalez will meet with the president of the 
Catalonian autonomous government, Jordi Pujol, to discuss the 
so-called autonomy dividend. Gonzalez is confident that the 
Catalonians will not insist all their demands be met 
immediately, and that Pujol will not present them as a 
nonnegotiable package. 
  CiU Spokesman Miquel Roca says the government can count on 
its support so long as its policies are reasonable. In private, 
the nationalists are more open in pledging continued support for 
the government, though they acknowledge some friction will be 
inevitable. On the socialist side, Felipe Gonzalez readily 
admits the vital importance of CiU's collaboration, which 
implies Spanish Government espousal of Catalonist policy tenets. 
  The socialists say they are prepared for the possibility of 
an electoral setback in June--in the European and Andalusian 
elections--and will continue to concentrate on the medium-term 
economic recovery they confidently expect, striving above all 
for the [social and labor] tranquility which, with the 
indispensable help of the CiU, will virtually guarantee them a 
continued parliamentary majority. 
  Gonzalez thinks the nationalist coalition will guarantee his 
government's survival at least to the end of next year, since he 
has a verbal promise--CiU balked at signing any document--that 
it will support his 1995 budget bill. 
  Despite highly publicized indicators that the economy may be 
stabilizing, Gonzalez admitted in a talk with a group of 
journalists that the economic situation is of extraordinary 
gravity. By way of example and to dash any false hopes, he cited 
the fact that the unemployment rate is now equal to what it was 
in 1982. Back then, Gonzalez considered labor's plight 
intolerable, and he painted a grim picture of the legacy 
bequeathed to him by the UCD [Democratic Center Union] 
governments. 
  Gonzalez notes the seriousness of the current situation and 
is very pleased with progress on the CiU accord, which will 
allow legislation to go forward. He is also pleased that the PNV 
[Basque Nationalist Party], despite some harsh verbal exchanges, 
supported his investiture as prime minister, refrained from 
trying to amend the budget bills, and has supported labor reform. 
  All of which is to say that the Basques of PNV have 
contributed with their votes, as they are wont to say these 
days, to those important elements of socialist policy from which 
in the past they had notably distanced themselves--an aloofness 
somewhat alleviated by the well-publicized meeting last 
Wednesday [19 January] between Deputy Prime Minister Narcis 
Serra and PNV leader Xabier Arzalluz. 
  The socialists have plans on the books extending as far as 
the end of 1995. For example, they are counting on CiU's support 
in that year's budget battle, though they admit there is not and 
will not be a written pact with the Catalonian nationalists, as 
the latter prefer to take one day at a time without making 
commitments for the future. 
  In official statements, Miquel Roca and other leaders of his 
party boast that the government's survival depends on their 
cooperation and say their continued support will depend on the 
specifics of the government's policy. In private, however, they 
take pains to give virtual guarantees of continued collaboration 
so long as the socialists move forward on issues they feel are 
important. 
  Furthermore, cooperation is very close in all fields and in 
all the ministries. As evidenced, for example, by the close 
collaborative ties which Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch 
and Transport Minister Jose Borrell maintain with CiU 
representatives. 
<H5>  Friction Ahead </H5>
  The head of government is under no illusions; he is well 
aware there will be some inevitable friction with the 
nationalists, and among the nationalists themselves, though he 
does not think disputes between Convergence and its Union 
partners will affect CiU's relations with the central government. 
  Ten days from now Gonzalez will be meeting with president 
Jordi Pujol to resume the suspended transfer process with 
Catalonia, which Catalonians call the "autonomy dividend." 
Gonzalez's initial impression is that Pujol will be moderate in 
his demands at this meeting and give the government a reasonable 
period of time to meet them. 
  Also, leaders of the Basque government will meet next week 
with the minister for public administration, Jeronimo Saavedra, 
in an effort to renormalize relations between PNV and PSOE. At 
the same time, the PNV spokesman in Congress, Inaki Anasagasti, 
will be resuming the "democratic impetus" dialogue. 
<H5>  Stay the Course </H5>
  Both in the People's Party [PP] and in United Left [IU], the 
idea has been gaining currency that Gonzalez will dissolve 
parliament next fall because of the supposedly chaotic situation 
that will result from the fall-off of parliamentary support, the 
continued rise of unemployment, and the expected drubbing of the 
PSOE in the European elections and the Andalusian regional 
elections next June. Gonzalez is aware of these prophesies and 
has strongly and insistently denied there is any truth to them. 
  There will be no early elections, even in the event of an 
electoral debacle in June, Gonzalez insists. The government has 
already analyzed the unfavorable electoral environment for 
European incumbents regardless of ideological orientation. 
Opposition Laborites in Great Britain are rising in the polls 
against conservative John Major, and the same phenomenon is 
working against Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. 
  European governments are going to lose elections, members of 
the Spanish cabinet say, because the wave of pessimism now 
sweeping the continent will result in voters casting ballots to 
"punish" incumbent political leaders. With this stoic hypothesis 
the socialists will try to endure the "bitter cup" they must 
drink in June and set their sights on future economic recovery. 
They realize, however, that even when recovery comes the 
opposition PP will continue to gain in strength, and Jose Maria 
Aznar's party is just biding its time until after the 1995 
regional and municipal elections. Only then, assuming the PP 
meets its goal of winning in the majority of city hall races, 
will Aznar demand early elections. 
  Within the PP, there are divergent views respecting when 
would be the opportune moment to make their big bid for power. 
If elections were held this October, the PP would be prepared. 
But the difficult economic situation frightens them, and some in 
the party would prefer to come to power after 1994, when the 
economy is on the road to recovery.

<F P=106> [Article: "People's Party Calls For Withdrawal of Spanish </F>
`Blue Helmets' from Bosnia"] 
  [Text] The military affairs spokesman for the People's 
Party [PP], Santiago Lopez Valdivielso, yesterday said his 
parliamentary group will ask that the government "not under any 
circumstances send more troops to replace our forces" in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which amounts to asking for withdrawal of 
Spain's 1,200 blue helmets. The announcement reflects a change 
of position for the main opposition party, which until now was 
ambivalent on the issue. 
  The current Spanish contingent, the third sent to the 
Balkans 
since October 1992, completes its six-month tour of duty in the 
zone on 23 March. The government has not decided whether to send 
fresh troops to relieve them, but the Army is preparing the 
Cordoba Group, composed of troops from the 21st Mechanized 
Brigade of the Brunete Armored Division, to replace the Madrid 
Group during the month of April. 
  Lopez Valdivielso yesterday served notice of his group's 
opposition to the deployment of relief troops, alleging that the 
presence of the blue helmets, despite the "enormous 
professionalism, dedication, and valor" of Spanish soldiers, 
"serves more to keep the war going than to lessen the impact on 
the civilian population." 
  "On numerous occasions, the blue helmets not only have been 
unable to impose their moral authority but have been subjected 
to almost insupportable humiliations," he added. 
  According to the PP spokesman, "Spain's decision should be 
properly coordinated with the other European governments 
involved in the operation and announced immediately at the 
United Nations, so that if it is decided to maintain the blue 
helmet presence, there will be time to find other troops to 
replace the Spaniards." 
<H5>  Ministry Replies </H5>
  Referring to a withdrawal of blue helmets, a spokesman for 
the Defense Ministry said yesterday that "Spain cannot make a 
decision of this kind unilaterally," and noted that the Spanish 
Government has announced its intention to "renew its deployment" 
of troops this spring if the parties concerned have not 
concluded a peace agreement by that time. 
  The decision would be made in conjunction with the other 
Western governments that maintain large contingents in Bosnia 
(United Kingdom, France, and Canada). However, Minister Julian 
Garcia Vargas indicated on Monday [17 January] in Bonn (Germany) 
that he considers a reduction of UN troop levels in the former 
Yugoslav Republic more likely than withdrawal. 
  Meanwhile, PP deputy Arsenio Fernandez of Mesa yesterday 
accused the government of "muzzling" the military service chiefs 
of staff by preventing them from appearing before Congress in 
closed session to report on Armed Forces operations. It will be 
Minister Garcia Vargas who reports to Congress behind closed 
doors on this subject.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Elections -- Choice of </F>
Continuity"] 
  [Text] The Socialist Party (PS) bureau, the steering 
committee of the Social Christian Party (PSC), and the executive 
committee of the Liberal Reformation Party (PRL) all selected on 
7 February the "stars" to head their electoral lists for the 
European elections in June. It will be, and no surprises here, 
Jose Happart, Gerard Deprez, and Jean Gol respectively who will 
be called upon to set their parties apart from the rest. The PS 
is placing its trust in the team of the five outgoing European 
deputies and therefore is banking on continuity. Jose Happart, 
Raymonde Dury, Claude Desama, and Claude Delacroix will stand 
for the four top spots. 
  Behind these four candidates for continuity are less 
well-known names, with the exception of the candidate in tenth 
and last spot, Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain. On the 
secondary list we find Claude Delacroix and Robert Urbain in 
first and second place respectively, and Ministers Laurette 
Onkelinx, Robert Collignon, and Magda De Galan bringing up the 
rear. 
  At the end of the bureau meeting the PS president stated: 
"We have put our trust in the outgoing team, while making room 
for younger people and women." 
  Despite the results of the most recent Dimarso poll, the PS 
is currently banking on four sitting MEPs [member of the 
European Parliament] for the European elections, Philippe 
Bosquin emphasized. Moreover, the results of the opinion polls 
should be read cautiously, he said, noting that the PS was way 
down in the polls at the start of 1993 while it was the only 
party to defend the wage-indexation system. 
  The PS president again justified giving the top two spots to 
Jose Happart and Raymonde Dury by noting the desire of the PS to 
reaffirm its commitment to the solidarity between Wallonia and 
Brussels and to equality of the sexes. 
<H5>  PSC: Deprez Signs Up Again </H5>
  The PSC's list for the European elections will thus again be 
headed by Gerard Deprez, followed by Fernand Herman and 
Dominique Jeanmoye. The last place goes to Albert Lienard, 
while ninth spot will be defended by Jean-Pierre Grafe. 
  Michele Bribosia is first on the secondary list, followed by 
Anne-Marie Corbisier and Marc Bertrand. In seventh, eight, and 
ninth place we find Jean-Louis Thys, Michel Lebrun, and Guy 
Lutgen. 
  In a press statement, the steering committee which drew up 
this list on Monday stated that five spots remained open, 
including the last spot on the secondary list, and that the 
mandate of the wise mens' committee had been confirmed to 
complete the list. 
<H3>  Liberal Reform Party-French-Speaking Democratic Front 
(PRL-FDF): Gol Before Spaak </H3>
  The PRL [Liberal Reform Party] executive committee met on 
Monday to examine the list that the PRL-FDF federation is to 
present for the European elections. This PRL-FDF list will be 
headed by PRL President and Deputy Jean Gol. Antoinette Spaak, 
the FDF [French-Speaking Democratic Front] deputy, will take 
second spot. 
  In a communique, Jean Gol stated that he wanted in this way 
to commit himself to strengthening the European Union, a liberal 
and democratic Europe, and the influence of the French-speaking 
community in Belgium and in Europe. He also wanted to offer the 
electorate the possibility of disowning the parties of the 
majority and the policy directions taken in Belgium by the 
Dehaene government. 
  The PRL's executive committee also decided that at least one 
third of the names on the PRL-FDF list would be women and that 
all the subregions of Wallonia would be represented, in addition 
to Brussels. 
  The complete PRL-FDF list should be officially presented 
sometime next week. 
  The PRL president's concluding speech delivered this weekend 
at the University of Liege, at the "Forum of Liberal and 
Democratic French-Speakers of Europe," traced the main policies 
which, to the president's mind, must be the leading principles 
guiding European integration: "European integration must above 
all be a political project; one of the most urgent tasks facing 
us is to reconcile the unity and diversity of Europe; we need 
more Europe, not less; we want a Europe that is strong, 
independent, and which can be sure of respect; Europe must first 
concern itself with the welfare of its citizens; different 
cultural identities are one of Europe's advantages and we must 
cultivate our identity, that of French language and culture; and 
Europe must be open to the rest of the world and take on greater 
responsibility."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ter Beek Still Considering Defense </F>
of UN Troops Adequate"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- Defense Minister Ter Beek is convinced 
that the Dutch troops can defend themselves adequately in 
Bosnia, even if tension rises as a result of airstrikes around 
Sarajevo. 
  During a 10 February television program, he said it was very 
important that the UN commanders on the spot be able, in 
agreement with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's 
representative, to decide quickly to request air support for 
their self-defense. In Parliament last week, Ter Beek labeled 
the possibility of requesting air support "an additional 
precaution for our ground forces." 
  Organizations of draftees are concerned about the 
consequences the NATO ultimatum and the threat of air strikes 
could have for the Dutch military in Bosnia. They say that this 
threat involves a shift of tasks and powers, because the UN 
troops are no longer deployed exclusively for peacekeeping 
operations, but also for peacemaking operations. In Bosnia, 
there will soon be some 500 draftees out of a total of 2,000 
troops. They volunteered for this mission. 
  Ter Beek disagrees with the interest groups. The job of the 
Dutch military did not change after NATO's decision. The Dutch 
are deployed in Bosnia to carry out humanitarian tasks, and 
their assignment and rules of engagement are unchanged: Force 
can only be used in self-defense, and for defending the 
population of the "safe areas" of Zepa and Srebrenica when it is 
at risk. 
  Should tension in the field rise as a result of the air 
strikes, ground forces can be concentrated in one place, so that 
they can defend themselves more efficiently.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Parliament Awards Fokker Defense </F>
Order Worth 300 Million"] 
  [Excerpt] Fokker has won a defense order worth nearly 300 
million guilders. The Second Chamber voted on Thursday [10 
February] to purchase four F-60's, the military version of the 
Fokker-50. Defense Secretary Frinking and Fokker's new top man, 
R. van Duinen, are to finalize the contract this afternoon. 
  The fact that Fokker was in the running in the first place 
for the supply of these four aircraft is thanks to Parliament. 
The Air Force, with the strong backing of Frinking's 
predecessor Baron Van Voorst of Voorst, the present governor of 
Limburg, did not originally believe Fokker capable of producing 
a medium-sized transport plane able to satisfy all modern 
military requirements. 
  The Air Force preferred Italian or Spanish aircraft. But the 
Second Chamber and the Ministry of Economic Affairs succeeded -- 
heedful of the dire straits of the Dutch plane manufacturer -- 
in allaying the doubts of the Ministry of Defense. The former 
is to contribute 30 million guilders to developing the aircraft, 
which is to be equipped with an extended fuselage, reinforced 
loading platform, and cargo door. The aircraft are to be used 
for transporting men and wounded and dropping parachutists.

  [Text] Ottawa, Canada, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and 
Canada agreed Monday [14 February] that they will form a special 
partnership for cooperation in trade, economic and regional 
development, and in international organizations. 
  Seoul-Ottawa trade cooperation anticipates South Korea's 
participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA), said Korean officials who are accompanying Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu on a visit to Canada. 
  Han held talks with his Canadian counterpart Andre Ouellet 
here Monday afternoon at which the Korean foreign minister 
expressed his country's desire to form a special relationship 
with NAFTA members. 
  Ouellet promised Han that Canada will actively study the 
South Korean proposal, according to the Korean officials. 
  Han briefed Ouellet on the positions of South Korea and the 
United States on the North Korean nuclear problem and asked for 
Canada's continuing support for resolution of the issue, they 
said. 
  Prior to visiting Ottawa, Han held talks with U.S. 
Government 
leaders on the North Korean problem in Washington. 
  Han and Ouellet shared the opinion that their countries, 
both 
surrounded by economically powerful neighbors, can work together 
and complement each other. They agreed to foster conditions for 
partnership in all fields, the officials said. 
  Han later met with Minister for International Trade Roy 
Maclaren and discussed trade promotion and economic cooperation. 
"They have agreed to form a partnership in political, economic, 
trade and other fields," the officials said. 
  The special relationship calls for an increase in trade, 
cooperation in regional and global issues, and efforts to 
achieve peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and the 
world. 
  With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, Ouellet said 
it is obvious the world does not want to see any country 
withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  He said Canada supports South Korean and U.S. efforts to 
resolve the issue through dialogue.

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister today marked the fifth 
anniversary of the late Ayatollah Khomeyni's death threat to 
author Salman Rushdie by warning Iran it could not enjoy "full 
and friendly relations" with the rest of the world until it was 
lifted. 
  But as John Major issued a statement backing Mr Rushdie, 
Iran 
renewed its threat to the author's life. Javad Larijani, an 
adviser to Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani, said: "We 
consider Rushdie as a man who tried to betray Islam, to 
downgrade Islam and to downgrade the sentiments of more than one 
billion Muslims. So...he does not deserve to exist." 
  On February 14, 1989, Ayatollah Khomeyni, then leader of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, issued his death threat -- or fatwa -- 
against Mr Rushdie and others associated with the publication of 
the author's book The Satanic Verses. 
  Mr Major said in his statement: "I met Salman Rushdie last 
May to demonstrate the Government's full support for his 
fundamental rights. 
  "I have been heartened by the way in which many governments 
around the world have demonstrated their support both by meeting 
Mr Rushdie and in their discussions with the Iranian government. 
  "We all want to make clear to the Iranian government that 
they cannot enjoy full and friendly relations with the rest of 
the international community unless and until we can be satisfied 
that there is no further direct or indirect threat from the 
Iranian authorities to Mr Rushdie's life, or to that of others 
associated with his book. 
  "I hope very much that they will listen to the message." 
When 
on Tehran radio Ayatollah Khomeyni pronounced on Mr Rushdie for 
alleged blasphemy, his words changed the Indian-born author's 
life, led to a breakdown in relations between Europe and Iran, 
and sparked violence across the Muslim world. Now, despite 
statements that Mr Rushdie intends to resume a more normal life, 
there is little prospect that he will be able to do so. So 
serious is the death threat that ever-watchful Special Branch 
bodyguards still move him from safe house to safe house. In the 
first five months of his "captivity" he was shifted 50 times. 
  Hitmen have already killed the Japanese translator of The 
Satanic Verses and attacked the Italian translator. Last 
October, the Norwegian publisher of the novel was shot and 
seriously wounded outside his home in Oslo. 
  The author's 24-hour protection has so far cost an estimated 
&pound;5 million, but he has contributed more than 
&pound;500,000 of 
his own money. 
  When Mr Major met Mr Rushdie at the Commons last May, Iran 
responded by raising from &pound;14 to &pound;504 the cost of a 
visa 
for British citizens travelling to Tehran. At the same time, 
top Iranian officials reiterated that Ayatollah Khomeyni's death 
sentence on Mr Rushdie was "irrevocable." 
  Despite reaffirmation of the death threat, Mr Rushdie has 
refused to remain hidden, visiting 15 countries since June 1992 
and even sharing a stage with rock group U2 before 70,000 fans 
at Wembley Stadium. 
  Last November he met President Bill Clinton at the White 
House. 
  Tehran cut relations with Britain in March 1989 over 
publication of Mr Rushdie's book. Diplomatic links were 
restored in September 1990, but Britain has made it clear that 
the resumption of full diplomatic relations depends on Iran 
lifting the fatwa.

<F P=106> [Interview with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth </F>
Clarke before his visit to France by LE FIGARO correspondent 
Jacques Duplouich in London on 7 February -- first paragraph is 
LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke today 
arrives in Paris for a 48-hour visit. He will meet Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery, 
Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, Raymond Barre, and Bank of 
France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet [passage omitted] 
  [Duplouich] Everyone agrees that you are a convinced 
pro-European who is intent on establishing Great Britain at the 
heart of Europe, following in the footsteps of John Major. 
Unlike your European partners, you continue to harbor just as 
many reservations as ever when it comes to Economic and Monetary 
Union [EMU], the single currency, the European central bank, etc. 
  [Clarke] John Major's government is a pro-European 
government. And I intend to ensure that Great Britain 
participates fully in the implementation of the second phase of 
EMU. Naturally, we have our own views on how the Union should 
organize itself. Consequently, I would like to see greater 
emphasis placed on the economic convergence of our countries 
than on the arbitrary establishment of a calendar proclaiming 
European integration. We are continuing to argue in favor of a 
free market, of a privatized economy, and of anything that might 
help us to resolve the structural causes of unemployment, 
especially the costs incurred by business and the burden of 
bureaucratic regulations. 
  [Duplouich] However, sterling is not going to rejoin the 
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS) so 
soon. 
  [Clarke] I still believe in the virtues of a system of 
stable 
parities, and the pound's Black Wednesday [16 September 1992] 
did not make me change my mind on this. However, I am not 
certain that the best way of obtaining stable parities will 
involve reestablishing links between our currencies within 
narrow bands of fluctuation. We will have to talk about this in 
due course, when we have made progress regarding the convergence 
of our economies. In any case, the pound will not rejoin the 
exchange rate mechanism during the current British legislative 
term, which will theoretically end in 1997. 
  [Duplouich] In order to remain competitive globally, 
especially among the industrialized nations, will the countries 
of the European Union have to simultaneously review both their 
social legislation and their laws governing work organization? 
  [Clarke] Yes. However, please note that this does not mean 
that they will have to break with their social traditions. On 
the other hand, what they will have to do is trim off any 
excesses, especially where they constitute an obstacle to 
employment. We must do away with any provisions which have a 
negative impact on competitiveness. We must take care not to 
increase the costs of our businesses to such an extent that 
their only way out consists of axing more jobs than necessary. 
This demand explains our intransigence vis-a-vis our 
continental partners regarding the social chapter of the 
Maastricht Treaty. Once again, it is not a case of abolishing 
social protection for employees, but rather of easing the burden 
on businesses so that they can face up to competition from the 
United States and Japan, among others. 
  [Duplouich] Given the current economic situation, do you 
believe that the implementation of a legal minimum wage is 
unwise? 
  [Clarke] Yes. There can be no doubt that it would indicate 
good intentions, but in reality for businesses it represents an 
expense per employee which far exceeds that to which they can 
reasonably agree. This, in turn, weighs heavily on employment. 
  [Duplouich] Could the shorter working week be an answer to 
unemployment? 
  [Clarke] To my mind, the approach in Europe to the 
unemployment problem is fundamentally flawed. In fact, people 
believe that the level of employment is fixed and that jobs must 
now be shared. According to this argument, if everyone works 
less and goes into retirement earlier, there will be more jobs 
on the market. What are the effects of this approach? A 
decline in competitiveness and an increase in the rate of job 
losses. The system does not work. The proof of this is that in 
certain European countries, which have the shortest working week 
and the longest paid holidays in the world, unemployment is not 
coming down either. On the contrary. 
  [Duplouich] What is your view on France's policy of a 
"strong 
franc?" 
  [Clarke] I note that it constituted the pillar of the 
economic program of the Left, and that it is still the pillar of 
the economic program of the current government. Of course, a 
policy of this kind imposes constraints when there are divergent 
monetary conditions in Germany, the Netherlands, and France. 
For our part, we defended sterling until Black Wednesday in 
September 1992. We then had to go ahead with a devaluation and, 
at the same time, adopt a policy of rigorous monetary 
discipline. I have already said that, contrary to the opinion 
held by our so-called Euroskeptics, unlinking sterling from the 
system of fixed parities accelerated economic recovery. I have 
been following the French experiment, which has after all proven 
partially similar to our own. The effects are different, but the 
government which is seeking to defend the "strong franc" has my 
support.

  [Text] Nicosia, Feb 14 (CNA)--Britain has no plans in the 
foreseeable future to close its military bases in Cyprus or 
withdraw from the U.N. peace-keeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). 
  This was stated by British Defence Minister Jeremy Hanley, 
replying to a question in the House of Commons about the future 
of Britain's military presence in this east Mediterranean 
island, a former British colony. 
  Minister Hanley said the United Kingdom's military presence 
comprises about 4,500 service civilian [as received] personnel 
in two sovereign base areas and a separate contribution of over 
400 troops to the United Nations Force in Cyprus. 
  "We have no plans to withdraw from either commitment in the 
foreseeable future, although we keep all our commitments under 
review," he said. 
  Britain, Greece and Turkey were the guarantor powers of 
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 treaty of establishment of 
the Cyprus Republic. 
  Under this treaty, Britain has retained two sovereign 
military bases and other facilities on the island. 
  Turkey has been occupying 37 per cent of Cyprus' territory 
since 1974, when thousands of heavily armed Turkish troops 
invaded the island's northern part, forcibly uprooting some 
200,000 Greek Cypriots from their homes.

<F P=106> ["H.V"-signed report: "Helmut Schmidt Becoming Adviser to </F>
Boris Yeltsin?"] 
  [Text] According to information that has been made 
available to WELT AM SONNTAG, Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
wants to find advisers in Germany who will get his country's 
ruined economy going again. 
  One of Yeltsin's closest advisers is currently holding talks 
in Germany to find out to what extent the Russian president can 
count on the support of internationally renowned economics 
experts. One of the German advisers Yeltsin would like to win 
over is Professor Otto Schlecht. 
  Schlecht was a leading official in the German Economics 
Ministry for 31 years, including 18 years as state secretary. 
At present he is chairman of the Ludwig Erhard Foundation, 
which promotes economic research programs all over the world. 
  Another personality Yeltsin would like to win over is former 
Social Democratic Party Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who was 
economics and finance minister before he became chancellor. 
Schmidt developed the European Monetary System together with 
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. 
  Yeltsin also hopes to be given special advice by Bundesbank 
President Hans Tietmeyer. 
  If Schlecht and Schmidt agree to act as Yeltsin's advisers, 
it is also hoped that France's Raymond Barre will accept a role 
in this cast. According to information available to WELT AM 
SONNTAG, Moscow has already established the appropriate contacts 
with Paris, hoping to gain the support of the renowned 
economist. Raymond Barre was French prime minister from 1976 to 
1981. Before that he was vice president of the European 
Commission in Brussels, where he was in charge of economic 
policy, and monetary problems in particular. Barre was professor 
of economics at the Sorbonne for many years. 
  The adviser problem has also become topical for Yeltsin 
because U.S. experts such as Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard 
University have resigned as advisers to the Russian government.

<F P=106> [Report signed "zz": "Lambsdorff: Summit Meetings Should be </F>
Abolished"] 
  [Text] Washington -- U.S. Congress approval for the Geneva 
agreements on the Uruguay round will be "no problem," the 
economic affairs spokesman of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP], Otto Count Lambsdorff, said in Washington, after 
talking to Ron Brown, United States secretary of commerce. 
  There is, however, "still a great deal of detailed work and 
formulating to be done." Lambsdorf does not share the concern 
of several U.S. politicians who think that state subsidies to 
industry might be increased following the coming into force of 
the Geneva agreements. Yet, there "is a tendency toward 
promoting industry in all countries." Promotion of industry is 
in better hands with companies than with the state, which he 
considers "on the way to a republic governed by commisars," due 
to the great number of technological boards. 
  Lambsdorff said that the annual World Economic Summits 
"should be abolished rather than continued in the existing 
form." Returning to smaller agendas and, thus, more intensive 
discussions would make sense. 
  In the FDP politician's view, the way the United States 
treats Japan is "extremely wrong." Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
reform efforts could have an enormous influence on the economic 
situation, which would profit the United States. The pressures 
that U.S. trade policy frequently exerts are "the wrong 
approach." Trade relations can never be seen from a bilateral 
point of view, but they should always "be seen through 
multilateral eyes." 
  Lambsdorff strongly criticized the United States and 
Europe's 
policy on the Balkans. He said Serb politicians are simply 
amused when once again there is talk of a NATO air strike, 
because "two days later the whole thing has been forgotten." At 
the moment, "Europe and the United States are making fools of 
themselves." 
  Lambsdorff welcomed President Clinton's performance during 
his latest trip to Europe. "Europe must be interested in the 
U.S. President remaining capable to act and negotiate," the 
former FDP chairman said. On 10 February, Lambsdorff will give 
a talk on "Continuity or Change" in Washington, and on 14 
November in New York, he will speak about "Germany's Economic 
Challenges."

<F P=106> ["Bar."-attributed commentary: "Back to GATT"] </F>
  [Text] People say that among friends differences of 
opinion can be settled with particular frankness. If the 
plainness of the words were a yardstick for the cordiality of 
relations, then there could be nothing better and more beautiful 
in international trade than trade between the United Statesa and 
Japan. Yet, the news and pictures of the weekend show the 
contrary: U.S. President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa were not trying to conceal that the Washington 
trade talks remained absolutely without any result -- and, what 
is worse, that the two sides even failed to show mutual 
understanding for the positions in the negotiations. 
  If the Americans do not remain cool, the situation might 
escalate into a trade war or at least into a worrying dispute. 
The question as to who is to blame will hardly find a clear 
answer. It may be difficult to provide evidence of flagrant 
Japanese infringements of the free trade agreements that were 
also signed by Japan. However, one cannot say either that the 
only obstacle to the Japanese market are the letters that are so 
unusual to Westerners. The difference between the theoretical 
and practical openness of the Japanese market is striking, and 
it has a lot to do with the close interrelations between the 
economy and the administration in Japan. 
  However, those who complain about discrimination must also 
ask themselves whether their product would really have such good 
chances on a completely open Japanese market. It is not without 
reason that the Japanese are so successful with their cars and 
their electronic products, which taught fear to their 
competitors in America and Europe. Thus, it is remarkable that 
the U.S. President should complain about Japanese trade 
restrictions without requesting their verifiable elimination, 
but that he is trying to achieve import figures and quotas for 
the U.S. economy. How should Hosokawa continue the difficult 
course of deregulation in Japan while taking home new 
regulations from trade talks? If he wants to retain credibility 
in terms of domestic policy, then he must not even listen to 
Clinton's proposal. 
  Diplomatic efforts in international economy must not 
progress 
to new agreements, but return to GATT rules. The more the world 
is divided up into trade blocks, the more often bilateral 
agreements will replace the most-favored nation status and 
nondiscrimination. This does not serve peace. We are still far 
away from the international society guided by universal values: 
Based on the spirit of GATT, one step toward it could be taken 
in world trade.

<F P=106> [Wolfram Baentsch commentary: "Two Men's Quarrel"] </F>
  [Text] Nobody will be able to claim later that the world 
has not been warned. Ever since U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
his Japanese guest Morihiro Hosokawa stepped in front of the 
White House microphones, jointly announcing that they do not 
agree, one of those disputes is looming that are hardly too 
dramatic to describe by the term "trade war." The fact is that 
history has seen cold and hot wars being waged for much lesser 
conflicts of interests. Apart from the Pacific Ocean, the two 
world economic powers are separated by a gigantic imbalance. It 
is adding up to an annual $50 billion in the United States' 
balance of trade. 
  Both sides declare that the deficit has to be cut. In the 
Japanese view, Clinton chose the wrong means at the wrong time. 
Japan is in the middle of the worst recession in recent history 
and it fears that terrible things might happen if it agrees to 
opening up its markets to an extent exactly defined by yens and 
dollars. It is, therefore, unlikely that Hosokawa, who does not 
tend to be subservient anyhow, will give way. A showdown can be 
expected. 
  The question is whether the Europeans will be able to watch 
an escalating conflict across the Pacific as a joyful third 
party. It might seem this way. They do not have any serious 
trade imbalances with the United States. And if the Americans 
manage to clear away the barriers with which Japan blocks off 
unwelcome imports, they might also be clearing the way for the 
Europeans. 
  Until then, and in the foreseeable future, there can only be 
losers in the Pacific economic powers' conflict. For, among the 
things that are at stake are the laboriously achieved results of 
the latest world trade round. Goodbye, lovely profits from 
prosperity!

<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Philipps: "Withdrawal From Somalia"] </F>
  [Text] When Iraqi dictator Saddam Husayn was put in his 
place (at least temporarily) by an international force under 
U.S. leadership and the Soviet Union disappeared in the 
maelstrom of history, paradisiacal visions were projected on the 
horizon and one saw the international community as a peacemaking 
organization. As we have meanwhile seen, not only that was a 
mirage. 
  In Somalia, the United Nations has proven to be incompetent 
and has failed. The clan warfare does not give a damn about the 
blue helmets. In front of our door, in the former Yugoslavia, 
the Serbs show the United Nations to be a paper tiger and the 
European Union has even been ignored. The NATO ultimatum is the 
acid test there. The states in Central and East Europe are 
watching further developments with the utmost attention. 
  Thus, it was high time that the Bundeswehr began its 
withdrawal from Belet Uen, which, for a long time, has stood in 
a very exposed position there. Each day in Somalia only 
endangers the soldiers' lives without bringing the country any 
closer to peace. 
  Whoever thinks that there will now also be an end to the 
domestic debate on future peacemaking Bundeswehr operations has 
not understood anything at all. The Germans cannot simply take 
leave of the duties and rights they assumed prior to 
reunification. The German declaration of joining the United 
Nations did not speak of any reservations.

<F P=106> [Report signed "old" report: "Trust Agency Organizes `Last </F>
Reserves'"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The 1993 promise by the German banking 
sector to buy Trust Agency companies for a total of 1 billion 
German marks [DM] has yielded only a "minimum result" so far. 
This was stated by Heinrich Hornef, financial director of the 
Trust Agency, in a talk to correspondents in Berlin. So far, 
only two companies have been taken over by banks. In addition, 
the Trust Agency has received four specific declarations of 
intent for taking over Trust Agency companies. Serious 
examinations are still under way for 10 to 15 companies, Hornef 
said. If one takes DM20 to DM40 million each as being needed to 
improve the companies, 30 to 50 companies should be sold. 
  Within the framework of a "last reserve," the Trust Agency 
will once again offer 50 to 60 appropriate firms for examination 
by the banks. In deviation from the original concept, minority 
participation has also been offered. "Our imagination will not 
be insufficient regarding the use of the DM1 billion. The Trust 
Agency is ready for unconventional solutions," Hornef said. 
  As one of the reasons for the low success of the bank DM1 
billion, Hornef cited differences in opinion about the 
portfolios of the companies. At first, the Trust Agency wanted 
to offer the companies in portfolios consisting of 10 to 25 
companies each. The banks, however, insisted on individual 
negotiations. Hornef accused the institutes of having reacted 
too slowly and inflexibly as a whole. 
  In 1993, two company portfolios with 32 companies were sold 
to the banking sector outside the Solidarity Pact. Without 
Trust Agency involvement, land banks took over 13 east German 
companies for a total of DM150 million. Of the 214 companies, 
which the Trust Agency offered to the banking sector and of 
which most were sent back to it, the Berlin Agency has meanwhile 
sold almost 100 to other interested persons.

<F P=106> ["df"-attributed report: "Parties to the Wage Negotiations </F>
Have Given Up `Taboo' Positions"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 12-13 February -- In talks with 
HANDELSBLATT Klaus Zwickel, chairman of the IG-Metall trade 
union, and Dr. Dieter Kirchner, general manager of the 
Gesamtmetall employers' association, explained why the top-level 
talks about the conclusion of anew collective agreement in 
Darmstadt failed. 
  Both parties to the wage negotiations gave up their previous 
taboo positions in Darmstadt. Giving up the vacation bonus or 
reducing wage costs by 15 percent hardly played a role, just as 
IG-Metall showed only little interest in wage raises. 
Gesamtmetall was willing to agree to a drastic shortening of 
work time on the condition that the working people renounce wage 
compensation; IG-Metall wanted to agree to that only if entire 
work forces were to work less than 35 hours per week, but not in 
case of a differentiation of work time between groups of working 
people within a company. 
  Agreement could have been reached about advancing the 
introduction of the 35-hour workweek, which has been agreed on 
by collective agreement as of 1 October 1995, since IG-Metall 
was willing to compensate the employers for the resulting costs. 
The collective agreement on opening clauses, which permit the 
companies to deviate from the collective agreement regarding 
work time regulations, was no problem anymore. IG-Metall was 
willing to offer an annual work time on the basis of a 35-hour 
workweek, which would have given the employers options with a 
range of 30 to 40 hours per week, if the regular work time had 
been adhered to on the annual average. 
  Despite these concurrences of the mutual negotiating 
positions, the top-level talks in Darmstadt failed because 
IG-Metall did not want to give up graduated wage compensation in 
a case of shortened work time for partial work forces. The 
IG-Metall Executive Committee now wants to explain the failure 
of the negotiations on 21 February and to hold a strike ballot 
on the possibility of a strike. There will probably be no 
further top-level talks before this date. 
  After the beginning of the strike, the instrument of 
"Special Arbitration" would then be applied, within the 
framework of which Gesamtmetall and IG-Metall would try to 
settle the wage conflict under the chairmanship of an arbiter, 
who would be decided on either by drawing lots or by agreement. 
It is assumed that such a development is necessary also so that 
the two parties to the wage negotiations can avoid internal 
pressure from their members, to which they are still subject to 
at the moment.

<F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck report: "Hintze Wants To Focus on Jobs in </F>
Election Campaign"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In an interview with DIE WELT, Peter 
Hintze, secretary general of the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU], noted a "worldwide tendency toward change" among the 
governments -- irrespective of the orientation of the 
governments. 
  In view of the worldwide recession, voters in the United 
States, Japan, or Greece act according to the following slogan: 
"Let us try the opposition." 
  Elections in Great Britain and Spain were exceptions. 
"There, the population considered the risk of a change to be 
too high." Hintze added: "This also applies to Germany. We 
will intensify the risk awareness during the election campaign. 
In view of the readiness among the population for change, 
Hintze supports a strategy that advocates the required political 
changes." 
  Thus, the CDU must offer factual and emotional arguments in 
the field of the economy and jobs during the election campaign, 
Hintze demanded. For this reason, the CDU wants to present its 
concept for growth and employment on the first day of its party 
congress in Hamburg. 
  Hintze stressed: "Foreign and security policy is an 
important area for the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] where it 
has a clear lead over the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD]. However, foreign and security issues alone are not 
sufficient for an election campaign." The CDU official referred 
warningly to the election campaign of former U.S. President 
George Bush against his challenger Bill Clinton. Bush mainly 
concentrated on foreign and security issues. The Democrats and 
Bill Clinton, however, focused on jobs. "The major topic in 
Germany is jobs, too," Hintze pointed out. 
  Thus, the CDU/CSU "must present new ideas for the economy 
and 
the employment situation" in the super election year 1994. 
Hintze stressed: "With Helmut Kohl, we must create prospects 
for the future at a time of great insecurity and worldwide 
changes." 
  "It is not enough to simply attack the Social Democrats. The 
citizens expect us to develop clear prospects for the future 
during the election campaign." 
  In this respect, the voters must be convinced that the SPD 
is 
no alternative to the Bonn coalition. Hintze stated: "Risking 
an alliance between the SPD and the Greens means endangering the 
economy and jobs."

<F P=106> [Report by Hannes Burger: "Streibl Confirms Meeting With </F>
Republikaner Chairman"] 
  [Text] Munich -- Former Bavarian Minister President Max 
Streibl, Christian Social Union [CSU], has confirmed to DIE WELT 
that he received Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber for a 
private visit last November. 
  Schoenhuber was the one who wanted the meeting, Streibl 
said. 
Since his decade-long personal contact with Schoenhuber had 
never been interrupted, he told himself: "Why not?" After all, 
after his resignation as minister president, he has had a number 
of talks with politicians from other parties. 
  The contents of this personal talk with Schoenhuber was 
"neither secret nor political." They primarily discussed joint 
memories of the time when both of them worked closely with Franz 
Josef Strauss and Edmund Stoiber. Streibl denied any intention 
to leave the CSU and even to join the Republikaner. Streibl: 
"Schoenhuber did not try to persuade me at all." 
  Bavarian Culture Minister Hans Zehetmair was "completely 
surprised" about Streibl's contacts with the Repulikaner. On 
the private SAT-1 television station, Zehetmair said that the 
Republikaner are the declared opponents of the CSU.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Before White Paper is Released -- </F>
Most National Assembly Defense Commission Members Favor Limited 
Atomic `Strike' Capacity"] 
  [Text] France's nuclear deterrent must be adapted to new 
realities and include capabilities for limited and highly 
accurate strikes. This is the doctrine currently advocated by a 
very large majority of the National Assembly's Defense 
Commission members in the 150-page report they have just written 
to present their choices before the government presents its own 
White Paper on Defense and military planning bill. 
  This is the first such parliamentary initiative in the 30 
years that the Assembly has been required to give its opinion on 
a military planning bill. 
  RPR [Rally for the Republic] Ain representative and 
Commission President Jacques Boyon has denied charges that the 
commission views the report as a "counter white paper"; the 
document lists the issues on which the majority and the 
opposition are in agreement, those on which there is some 
agreement between them, and those on which they disagree. PS 
[Socialist Party] Ille-et-Vilaine representative and former 
Commission President Jean-Michel Boucheron speaks of a 
"French-style consensus" on defense, with the only differences 
relating to nuclear testing and possibly the potential benefits 
of an antimissile defense system. 
  Commission members have more particularly focused on three 
basic issues: nuclear deterrence, the national service, and 
defense-related industries. 
  1. As for nuclear deterrence, the report states that "it is 
clear that while the current doctrine must be maintained, it 
needs to be adjusted to new realities. Our nuclear weapons must 
be designed bearing in mind a range of actions meant to defend 
our basic interests, and no longer our vital interests only. 
Deterrence can no longer be defined in `weak-to-strong' terms, 
but we will need capabilities for limited and highly accurate 
strikes. Such enlarged deterrence must prompt us to renew our 
nuclear weapon systems," which, according to a majority of 
commission members, presupposes resumed atomic testing even 
though "our current weapons are perfectly operational until 
2005." The commission notes that a broad consensus has emerged 
in favor of two nuclear "components": strategic submarines and a 
nuclear missile carried by the Rafale [fighter-bomber] (without 
choosing among Matra's competing Apache missile and 
Aerospatiale's ASLP [long-range air-to-surface missile]). 
  2. Conscription: This is the commission's preferred option 
as opposed to that of an exclusively professional army. The 
report notes that "developing civilian forms of national service 
must entail very high requirements with regard to equality of 
implementation -- equality among such new forms as well as with 
the military service. In any event, the search for new civilian 
forms must remain compatible with national defense requirements, 
and the needs of the Defense Ministry must retain priority 
status." 
  3. Industry: Most commission members -- a few of whom are 
the elected representatives of regions which boast armament 
production concerns -- condemn the general planning 
commissioner's recent report which suggests that, since France 
cannot do everything on its own due to financial considerations, 
it should abandon some activity areas in order to concentrate on 
priority sectors. 
  The report states that "clear differences have emerged as to 
the idea of focusing on some sectors of excellence and 
abandoning others, as apparently suggested in a recent planning 
report. A broad majority of commission members oppose this 
notion, deemed suicidal and unrealistic for our defense 
industry, and dangerous for our national independence. On the 
other hand, the commission acknowledges the need for European 
cooperation on a number of weapon types."

  [Text] Chadian President Idriss Deby, who is on a private 
visit to France, wanted to see President Mitterrand about the 
new economic situation created by the devaluation of the CFA 
franc. He is asking for extra help from Paris in paying some of 
the salary arrears of his civil servants. Idriss Deby was 
received at the Elysee yesterday evening. Among other subjects 
he raised with the French head of state was the Aouzou Strip, 
which is still occupied by the Libyans. 
  Idriss Deby claims to be conciliatory about this matter, at 
least for the moment, as he said when he left the Elysee: 
  [Begin Deby recording] We do not feel that there is any 
threat from Libya, even if we are of course worried. We have 
not heard any very clear reaction about any threat from Libya 
with regard to the decisions of the International Court of 
Justice. What is certain is that Libya agreed by common 
consent, as we did, to sign the Algiers framework agreement of 
31 August 1989, and we also submitted the case by common consent 
to the International Court of Justice. On behalf of Chad I am 
glad that right was found to be on our side. This is what is 
important for us: that the national and international public 
knows today that the Aouzou Strip belongs to Chad. Libya 
committed itself, and we are relying on its good faith and on 
its written commitments. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Letessier: "The Post-GATT Era Has Begun"] </F>
  [Text] International trade following the Uruguay 
Round negotiations--a new factor? While Peter Sutherland, the 
director general of the GATT is meeting with the officials of 
the European Union today to discuss the implementation of the 
agreement signed last 15 December, LE QUOTIDIEN is studying 
their impact on the French economy, sector by sector, and 
analyzing the prospects for the post-GATT period. The conclusion 
is that France emerges from the fray rather well, but the war 
will continue. 
<H5>  The Stakes in Industry and Agriculture </H5>
  "I will be following up on the commitments made by our 
partners with particular care," Gerard Longuet said last 
Wednesday [12 January] on the occasion of his announcement of 
the "consolidation of the GATT accords" as one of his goals for 
1994. The minister of industry and foreign trade was commenting 
on the document published by his staff on the results of the 
Uruguay Round negotiations. 
  Is it too soon to make an evaluation? Matters will change 
further between now and 15 April. Some countries have not yet 
finalized all of their offers with regard to the lowering of 
their customs duties. The participants have until the spring to 
submit new proposals more favorable to free trade. But the 
essentials have been established. France, for example, has 
reached final agreements with its 25 main trade partners. A 
global agreement was necessary. Now, it must be admitted that 
the success achieved in this realm is not complete. Certain 
sectors are still covered by separate agreements, if indeed they 
have not been completely excluded from the areas covered by the 
final Uruguay Round negotiation documents. Where these 
agreements are concerned, talks will have to be continued in the 
coming months, or even years. Maritime transportation, aviation, 
and the audiovisual media are the sectors mainly involved. This 
has led some to say that these are the sensitive issues that 
have vitiated the general agreement. No fair judgment of the 
scope of the accords will be possible until after their actual 
implementation, but a first assessment can now be drafted. It 
appears that some Third World countries are particularly 
displeased with the agreements, as is the case with India. "I 
have never heard such negative talk following an international 
agreement," Jean-Francois Boitin, deputy director of the 
Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE) at the Ministry 
of Finance admits. According to this highly placed French 
official who has followed the negotiations closely, the 
situation is relatively clear. "If I were the negotiator for one 
of the developing countries, I would be rather unhappy with the 
cavalier procedure used. On 14 December, an U.S.-European 
agreement was presented, with the other countries being given 24 
hours to approve it." But the GATT is not the only tool for 
promoting free trade. The financial aid provided by the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to the countries 
of the Third World is regularly accompanied by "firm 
encouragement" to open up their frontiers and to reduce customs 
barriers. 
  LE QUOTIDIEN has attempted to determine what the situation 
is, sector by sector, in order to analyze the advantages the 
signatory nations might derive therefrom and to identify the 
stakes involved in the coming years.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Urgent Need Is To Create Added </F>
Value"] 
  [Text] This is the great innovation. Henceforth, the 
agricultural sector is an integral part of the GATT system. 
Fixed customs rates will replace the varying duties that have 
been imposed at the frontiers to date. These rates will be 
reduced by 36 percent over a period of six years. A minimal 
opening up of access to all of the markets is planned. Domestic 
measures to support prices will be reduced by 20 percent, but 
direct aid to producers will be allowed. Subsidized exports, for 
their part, will be reduced by 21 percent in volume, while 
overall budget support of exports, for its part, will be reduced 
by 36 percent in value. The reduction commitments will not apply 
to the "less-developed countries." 
  A first assessment can be made. The Americans emerge from 
the 
agreement as the principal winners, inasmuch as their system of 
subsidies is not altered by the final document. This is because 
one of the advantages they still enjoy is that their domestic 
prices are close to those quoted internationally. There is a 
greater disparity between the prices guaranteed to the producers 
in Europe and international prices. 
  Despite everything, the Europeans have not come out of these 
accords too badly. The bulk of the guidelines had already been 
established by the Common Agricultural Policy of the Union 
(CAP). But a new reform of the CAP is to be expected in the 
years to come (additional restrictions on the production of 
beef). While subsidized exports will be reduced, those exports 
that are not subsidized may increase thanks to the opening up of 
certain markets. In France, the producers of basic foodstuffs 
such as grains and beef will suffer as a result of the 
agricultural accord. On the other hand, it will benefit the 
manufacturers of processed or "luxury" products such as wines, 
poultry, cheeses, and dairy products. "There has been a 
psychological and political overinvestment where this issue is 
concerned," Michel Rainelli, a professor at the University of 
Sophia-Antipolis, believes. "Economically, this is a 
satisfactory agreement for France. But it is difficult to pursue 
this discussion with the farmers. Instead of taking agriculture 
as a whole into account, the debate has become polarized around 
the oleaginous crops and wheat. But the wine producers are aware 
of the opportunities provided by the opening up of the markets." 
  The assessment is clearly less favorable for a certain 
number 
of other countries. The producers in the Cairns group 
(Australia, Argentina, Canada, etc.), who fought for a real 
opening up of the agricultural markets, are likely to have to 
pay the cost of an understanding between Europe and the United 
States. In the short run, it is the developing countries that 
will be the main losers as a result of the accords, according to 
Abdelaziz L. Alaoui, a Paribas Bank economist. They will no 
longer benefit from the exemption allowed them on the subsidized 
European wheat they receive. The social consequences to be 
expected from a rise in prices are likely to be harsh.

<F P=106> [LE QUOTIEDIEN DE PARIS interview with Helene Delorme, </F>
research director at the National Political Science Foundation; 
place and date not given: "Toward Political Choices: Opinion of 
Helen Delorme, National Political Science Foundation Research 
Director and Agricultural Expert"] 
  [Text] [LE QUOTIDIEN] What is your analysis of the results 
of the negotiations? 
  [Delorme] The accords reveal a certain complicity between 
the 
United States and Europe, rather than competition. They have 
arranged the resources so as to allow the two major powers to 
support their agricultural sectors, protect their imports, and 
subsidize their exports. The countries that hoped for a real 
opening up of the markets, such as those in the Cairns group, 
have been greatly disappointed. They cannot support their 
exports financially. Nor do they have the political power that 
would allow them to reject an agreement drafted without their 
participation. 
  [LE QUOTIDIEN] What are the future stakes for the countries 
in the European Union? 
  [Delorme] The agreement requires the Community to implement 
the CAP seriously. The reduction in prices for which it called 
has in effect been canceled out by the measures adopted 
following the monetary chaos in the fall of 1992. The green ECU 
[European currency unit], which expresses the guaranteed 
agricultural prices, was aligned with the mark at that time. In 
this way, Germany avoided a reduction in its prices just a few 
months prior to the legislative elections. But the other 
countries had to raise theirs. Apart from its budgetary cost, 
this policy threatens the competitive capacity of European 
products, grains in particular, since they are minimally 
differentiated products that are very sensitive to relative 
prices. Their price increases have prevented these countries 
from winning back the European market, in competing with the 
substitutes imported for animal feed, but they will also prevent 
them from exporting without subsidization in the future. France 
obtained a commitment from its partners not to expand their 
fallow land areas further. But how, then, will the future price 
drops be offset? By the European budget, but with a reduction in 
aid to the Mediterranean producers? Or by the national budgets, 
with a favorable modulation for the major producers? 
  [LE QUOTIDIEN] Can France manage the future of its 
agricultural sector in the post-GATT era? 
  [Delorme] Public assistance to the agricultural sector will 
have to be reorganized. In all the sectors, including grain 
production as well as livestock breeding, both the very large 
operations and those of medium size feel that they have been 
weakened, because they cannot modernize without the assistance 
of the state. The choice of those among them that must receive 
priority support is above all a sociopolitical choice. On the 
international level, France will from now on have an opportunity 
for alliances that are more varied than its traditional link 
with Germany within the Community. The United Kingdom, The 
Netherlands, and Denmark, all countries that import grains, look 
with favor on a reduction in prices. Paris could also obtain 
support from Washington in the effort to persuade Germany to 
lower its prices. And so France could give priority to 
production with substantial added value, rather than focusing 
solely on grains.

  [Text] The agreement reached in December does not include 
any decision pertaining to the maritime transportation sector. 
The signatories of the GATT have begun a new round of 
negotiations on this single issue. An agreement should be 
reached by the end of 1996. Between now and that time, the 
status of most favored nation will not apply to this sector. 
  Europe had proposed opening up maritime transportation (with 
the exception of coastal shipping between two ports in a given 
country) to competition. But while the European nations have 
almost entirely opened up their markets, they have not been able 
to obtain reciprocal treatment from the Americans, who have a 
very protectionist policy in this sector. For a long time, the 
Americans in this sector have benefited from federal legislative 
protection of their activities, which gives them priority on the 
domestic market. The negotiators submitted minimal offers with 
regard to the opening up of their markets. Countries like Japan, 
Mexico, and Korea followed suit. Without result. The European 
shipowners reject the institutionalization of the current 
situation, wherein they come up against protectionism in 
numerous countries, while at the same time competitors can 
attack them on their own home ground. Therefore no offer was 
included in the global accord, and new negotiations will be 
launched. 
  Between now and the end of 1996, none of the parties should 
be able to strengthen their protectionist arsenals, except by 
means of retaliatory measures. But the Central Committee of 
French Shipowners (CCAF) would have preferred a freeze, followed 
by the dismantling of the protectionist regulations. 
  According to one market analyst, the heaviest losers as a 
consequence of this accord are likely to be the Asian countries, 
Taiwan in particular (Evergreen is the largest international 
shipowner), and the countries of northern Europe, such as 
Denmark, for example. Greece will also be affected.

of the General Maritime Company (CGM), the publicly-owned

European Alliances"] 
  [Text] [LE QUOTIDIEN] What is your analysis of the status 
quo that has been confirmed by the GATT accords? 
  [Giuily] The American and Japanese protectionist systems, 
which work to the disadvantage of the European shipowners, have 
indeed been retained. But the freeing up of the markets, to 
which we are committed in order to reestablish a certain 
balance, could have challenged certain market organization 
principles (with the shipowners' associations) that we would 
hope to maintain. 
  [LE QUOTIDIEN] What do you plan on doing with regard to the 
foreign competition on your traditional markets? 
  [Giuily] We must improve our competitive capacity and reduce 
our costs. Our strategy will also be based on alliances with the 
European shipowners--the Bollore group's SDV, or others. But the 
opening up of the American and Asiatic markets should in any 
case be negotiated. The European Community should not propose 
additional liberalization on a unilateral basis.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Concerns in the Garment Industry"] </F>
  [Text] The GATT has made the abrogation of the multifiber 
accord (AMF) that has governed trade in the textile sector since 
1974 official. The AMF will be reintegrated in the GATT in three 
phases, over a period of 10 years. 
  For the time being, none of the countries have as yet 
finalized their offers where the opening up of their markets is 
concerned. Thus the negotiations will continue for several 
months. The United States has not rejected the rate ceilings 
(higher than 35 percent) applicable to the products in which the 
developing countries are competitive. The garment industry, in 
which the manpower criterion is particularly important, is 
increasingly threatened. The very intensive manpower factor in 
the clothing sector in Portugal and Greece is the source of some 
concern because of the cost difference, which handicaps these 
countries vis-a-vis the PVD [less-developed countries]. 
  Although French textiles are always manufactured on our own 
territory, the industrialists have already launched the process 
of shifting the manufacturing of garments to the Maghreb or the 
island of Mauritius, for example, GATT or no. But design and 
final processing will remain in the countries paying high wages, 
including France. However, "It is estimated that within five 
years, almost 150,000 jobs in the textile-garment industry may 
cease to exist," Georges Jolles, the new president of the Union 
of Textile Industries (UIT) says. The job stakes remain 
extremely important. This is the case, moreover, with the other 
labor-intensive industries. The Longuet Report reminds us that 
in France, the manufacturing of clocks and watches provides 
7,000 jobs, the shoe industry 35,000, the paper and cardboard 
industry 25,000, the tire sector 32,000, and the toy industry 
8,000. 
  For the time being, the professionals are complaining of the 
limited openness agreed to by the American, Indian, and 
Pakistani governments. According to the Union of Clothing 
Industries, there is a strong potential market in certain of the 
developing countries where the emergence of a middle class can 
be seen. 
  India and Pakistan have thus far refused to participate. But 
the experts note that trade negotiations are not the only means 
available for lowering customs barriers. The financial aid 
provided to the PVD by the International Monetary Fund and the 
World Bank within the framework of the "structural adjustment" 
policy is often accompanied by "very firm recommendations" that 
they open up their frontiers. There remains one last positive 
point. Seven out of every 10 international patent infringements 
pertaining to textiles involve French products. In other words, 
the French industrialists will benefit from the agreements 
reached on patent rights (see tomorrow's LE QUOTIDIEN).

president and founder of Biderman International, the "leading" 
French menswear manufacturer; place and date not given: 
"150,000 Jobs Threatened"] 
  [Text] [LE QUOTIDIEN] What will the consequences of the 
accord be for your sector? 
  [Biderman] The agreement is more negative for the clothing 
industry than for textiles in general. The lack of a definitive 
agreement and the maintenance of the tariff ceilings are 
threatening 150,000 of the 600,000 jobs in this sector in 
France, according to the experts. I share these fears. We must 
expect export difficulties, and that we will face savage 
competition. 
  [LE QUOTIDIEN] How do you plan to respond? 
  [Biderman] I do not foresee major upsets for my business in 
the job sector. We have already made restructuring efforts in 
the course of these recent years. The solution in the medium 
time range seems to me to be specialization in quality products, 
in the designer label sector. We are already in the front ran k 
in the middle and upper ranges, since we supply Saint-Laurent, 
Daniel Hechter, and Courreges with ready-to-wear garments. Now, 
I am not sure that the leading designers will be willing to 
entrust their labels to manufacturers located out of the 
country. But the horizon beyond the year 1995 is not very clear. 
At the present time, I am not in a position to make predictions 
over the longer term. My immediate concerns are the domestic 
consumption level (down five percent in October for textiles) 
and the reorganization of distribution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Subsidies Battle May Continue"] </F>
  [Text] The aviation sector is also one of the issues not 
covered by the 15 December agreement. Negotiations aimed at 
drafting a sectorial code for aviation will continue for a year. 
The various subsidy systems are at the heart of the conflict 
between the Europeans and the Americans. 
  For airplanes with a capacity of more than 100 passengers, 
the 1992 U.S.-European accord should still apply, at least until 
the spring of 1995. It limits direct aid (the Community system) 
to 33 percent of development costs and indirect aid (the U.S. 
system) to 4 percent of the turnover total. A new accord is 
supposed to be signed in April 1994, to take effect one year 
later. It will also pertain to small aircraft and engines. If, 
after a year, the negotiations have failed, the aviation sector 
will be integrated in the General Subsidies Code (as defined by 
the GATT), with modifications to take the specific 
characteristics of the sector into account. One of the solutions 
conceived by the major European construction enterprises with 
regard to adapting to GATT calls for nothing less and nothing 
more than adopting a subsidies code close to that used by the 
Americans. Indirect aid (via NASA or the Department of Defense) 
is difficult to quantify, unlike the direct aid provided in 
Europe in the form of reimbursable advances. In addition, the 
civilian aircraft manufacturers in America benefit greatly from 
the research carried out within a military context, which is not 
affected by the GATT. This is the case regarding the development 
of engines, in particular. 
  But differences on the position that should be supported 
emerged in connection with the manufacturers of small aircraft, 
equipment, and engines. 
  Another controversial subject is the structure of sales. 
According to Yves Michot, the director general of Aerospatiale, 
orders placed by the American government administration and 
agencies account for 70 percent of the turnover totals of the 
aviation firms on the other side of the Atlantic, with the 
remaining 30 percent representing sales to the private sector, 
either on the domestic market or for export. In France, the 
proportion is exactly the reverse, so that to achieve the same 
result, the budget of the Ministry of Defense alone would have 
to be quadrupled. 
  The only advantage the European industrialists see in the 
possibility of an agreement in the aeronautics sector that would 
be integrated into the GATT is that the reimbursable support by 
the European nations to their industries, which has been the 
subject of constant litigation with the Americans, would be 
legitimized. These advances could not be demanded in the event 
of a failure of the program involved.

Airbus Industrie Director of International Affairs; place and 
date not given: "Repaying the Americans in Kind"] 
  [Text] [LE QUOTIDIEN] What is your analysis of the status 
quo endorsed by the GATT for your sector? 
  [Deschelotte] The provisional arrangement is not 
satisfactory, insofar as the threshold of four percent (of the 
CA [turnover]) for indirect public assistance allowed the United 
States is generous. This system, which is difficult to control, 
also makes major financing efforts possible. 
  [LE QUOTIDIEN] What solutions do you envision? 
  [Deschelotte] The European governments must become aware of 
the need to adapt the financing system to international 
conditions. Since it is impossible to control the United States, 
let us adopt their indirect aid system. This type of aid is not 
necessarily the most efficient economically, but, on the other 
hand, it is better adapted to the Anglo-Saxon rules of the GATT. 
And this is no accident, moreover, because it is the Americans 
who shaped the spirit of the GATT. What is needed is to abandon 
"vertical" aid and the project by project approach in favor of 
the horizontal financing of research projects. 
  Another type of aid can be envisioned in the form of 
purchases by the governments that support us with military or 
tanker versions of the Airbus. This would enable us to find new 
outlets and to amortize our production. 
  [LE QUOTIDIEN] What is the state of mind, at present, on one 
side of the Atlantic and the other? 
[Deschelotte] The European governments are beginning to become 
aware of what is at stake. This was urgently needed, because the 
nefarious effects resulting from the current distortions will 
not be visible until we are truly lagging behind the Americans.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Industry Ministry's Document: </F>
Sensitive Areas"] 
  [Text] When he met with the press last Wednesday [12 
January], Gerard Longuet took the opportunity to set forth a 
first assessment of the results obtained for France in the 
course of the Uruguay Round negotiations. This assessment is 
contained in a booklet of 35 pages. We are mentioning here the 
portions pertaining to certain sensitive parts in our industrial 
sector. 

  -  The European Union has refused to further open up 
its market for a number of nonferrous metals and is demanding 
the effective elimination of nontariff obstacles by our main 
competitors. In order to maintain the 115,000 jobs in their 
aluminum sector (of which 15,000 are in France), the European 
nations won agreement on the maintenance of tariff barriers in a 
market that is suffering seriously from world overproduction. 
  -  It 
was not possible to achieve a multilateral agreement on steel 
because of the continuing disputes between the United States and 
the exporter countries (European Union, Japan, Korea), and 
because of the fact that a decision on the restructuring of the 
European iron and steel industry is still awaited. The 
discussions be continue. In the absence of an agreement, the 
sector would be integrated in the GATT system in 18 months. 
  -  The 
customs duties on the electronic products of the major public 
enterprises (100,000 jobs in Europe, 14,000 in France) have not 
been lowered. This is a very sensitive sector because of the 
manpower costs, the research and development efforts, and the 
risks involved in the shifting of production facilities to 
Central and East European countries. 
  -  Despite the mutual opening 
up agreed upon by the Americans and the Japanese in the 
semiconductor sector, the European nations will continue to 
monitor the development of this technology closely. This is 
something a tariff schedule cannot do, and this leaves room for 
the fear that the established regulations might be 
circumvented. 
  -  The duties on telecommunications and 
data-processing equipment were the subject of closed 
negotiations in which the Europeans, Americans, and Japanese 
participated. This industry in France, where its capacity to 
compete depends heavily on manpower costs, will have to adapt 
gradually to a new situation, particularly with regard to 
telephone sets, on which the duty has been reduced to zero.

<F P=106> [Article by Christophe Chatelot in Bucharest: "Romania: </F>
Paris and Bucharest Sign Agreement on Illegal Immigrant 
Repatriation"] 
  [Text] On Friday 11 February in Bucharest, the French and 
Romanian Foreign Ministries signed a repatriation agreement 
concerning Romanian nationals staying illegally in France. 
  Both parties have agreed, among other things, on the 
criteria 
to be used to determine Romanian citizenship of "indesirables" 
who have discarded their identity papers to avoid being turned 
away. In return, Romanian authorities have asked France to 
simplify the visa delivery procedure for Romanian businessmen. 
  Officially, some 3,000 applications for refugee status have 
been submitted to the French authorities by Romanian nationals. 
However, "this figure does not give an accurate picture of the 
actual numbers of illegal aliens," say French authorities. 
  For comparison purposes, 23,000 Romanian illegals have been 
repatriated from Germany in the last few months as part of an 
agreement comparable to the one concluded with France; Bucharest 
already has similar agreements with Sweden, Austria, Poland, and 
the Czech Republic. 
  According to immigration figures of the International 
Migration Office (IMO), 9 percent of Romanians over 15 years of 
age want to leave Romania. In 1993, Western countries only took 
in 18,000.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta by </F>
Leopoldo Fabiani; place and date not given: "Andreatta's Hope: 
`Bosnia Can Be Saved'"--first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- The situation in Bosnia can now be 
regarded "slightly less pessimistically," thanks mainly to the 
rapprochement between the United States and Europe that enabled 
NATO on 9 February to issue an ultimatum to the Serbs to lift 
their siege on Sarajevo. Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta 
seemed less happy about certain "toxins" that the international 
situation could cause to circulate in the organism of Italian 
politics. He thus described as "crazy" the ideas of those 
making "territorial demands" vis-a-vis the former Yugoslavia. 
They include Gianfranco Fini, the National Alliance leader, who 
has spoken about the "historical rights" of Italians in Istria. 
Andreatta demanded peremptorily of those who have reached 
electoral agreements with the National Alliance, first and 
foremost of [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, that they 
"immediately sever any joint responsibilities." This, because 
"in the event of a victory by the right, the world's governments 
will perceive the most dangerous sign of a complete turnabout in 
Italian foreign policy" and in the country's international 
position. "I do not believe," Andreatta concluded, "that 
Berlusconi likes the role of Italy's [Russian nationalistic 
leader] Zhirinovskiy. He must see to this while there is still 
time." [passage omitted] 
  [Fabiani] Minister, some people still believe that the 
ultimatum issued to the Serbs will not be implemented, that 
Europe will exploit any sign of amenability to refrain from 
using force. 
  [Andreatta] To fail to honor the commitment made would 
entail 
a very high cost. It would jeopardize NATO's credibility far 
beyond the Bosnian question. But everyone now is convinced of 
the need to act. The likelihood of success has improved. Now 
it is important to maintain this pace, to avoid falling back 
into the swamp of unproductive diplomatic activity when 
everything deteriorates, and again paying the cost to our nerves 
of our action in recent months. 
  [Fabiani] Why are you now less [as published] optimistic or, 
if you prefer, less pessimistic, about the chance of halting the 
war in Bosnia? 
  [Andreatta] First, because of the rapprochement between the 
United States and Europe. This was achieved when the French 
said that their country's honor would not permit them to keep 
their men in Bosnia as blue helmets without taking action. For 
a moment France and the United States were close to a 
confrontation. Then, faced with the threat of Paris' 
withdrawing its troops, the American administration realized the 
implications of a split with its allies. The diplomacy of the 
Twelve also helped to persuade the Americans. This 24-handed 
approach scored its first success since the Maastricht Treaty, 
after several attempts. A part was also played by France's 
traditional tactic of pushing its relations with Washington to 
the limit. The public in the various countries, shocked by the 
pictures shown in the media, also greatly influenced the 
decision to take action. 
  [Fabiani] Will it be possible to overcome Russia's 
objections? 
  [Andreatta] Despite Zhirinovskiy and despite the blackout in 
communications with Washington that lasted a couple of days, 
Russia has never sought a rupture, not even at the worst moment. 
I felt this clearly when I met in Geneva with Deputy Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin, and I explained to him the rationale behind the 
decision that NATO was reaching at that very moment. 
  [Fabiani] But has anything changed between the warring 
parties? 
  [Andreatta] Some positive signs, some more rational 
attitudes, can be seen here too. The sanctions against Serbia 
have not yet caused a final crisis for the government, but 
economic normalization is now a serious objective for Milosevic. 
And during the latest elections he has also rid himself of the 
extremist nationalism represented by Seselj. The Croats felt 
that Bonn's support had weakened. Tudjman now seems more 
moderate. Then there are the Muslims. Within the space of a 
few months a near-miracle has taken place -- the creation from 
nothing of a Bosnian military force comprising 200,000 men. On 
the one hand this sets back a long way the plan to totally 
eliminate the Muslims, which some people were nurturing. But, 
on the other hand, it could prompt the Bosnians to form too 
optimistic an assessment of their own strength. But now the 
Americans can recommend realistic objectives to them. 
  [Fabiani] What do you think of the Serbian threats of 
retaliation against Italian territory? 
  [Andreatta] That is a problem for the Serbs. It is our 
problem too, of course, but it is their problem first and 
foremost. Relations between the two countries are fair. I do 
not think that they could be jeopardized by some carelessness on 
the part of Belgrade's secret services -- which are in fact 
fairly efficient -- with respect to Serbian terrorist groups. 
  [Fabiani] Are you satisfied with the Italian public's 
response to events in the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Andreatta] At present our country is threatened by the most 
brazen form of videocracy. The media are no longer an 
expression of public opinion but a training forum for 
politicians. So there has been excessive reaction, though some 
commentators well-informed about international matters have 
tried to contain these reactions within more correct limits. 
  [Fabiani] What is your opinion of the political debate on 
foreign policy matters? 
  [Andreatta] The territorial demands put forward by the 
National Alliance raise some very serious problems concerning 
the possibility of a country's continuing to be a trustworthy 
partner in foreign policy. To claim "historic rights" in Istria 
could prompt the same dismay in Europe as the German neo-Nazis 
prompt when they talk about Sudetenland or German Silesia. I 
expect Fini's allies to sever all responsibilities and to break 
all electoral links too. Otherwise this creates a major 
grouping that has some chance of forming a majority and 
therefore of leading the country, and that embodies some crazy 
ideas. We must create scope for the voters' sense of reason, so 
that they will not vote for fairy stores, not vote for 
"beautiful." 
  [Fabiani] But do Italian politicians think of citizens only 
as voters? 
  [Andreatta] Generally, this is so. It is no coincidence that 
some people want to prevent the citizens that they do not like 
from expressing themselves, as in the case of postal votes for 
Italians abroad. 
  [Fabiani] Minister, you seem to have formed an enthusiasm 
for 
what is a new job for you. Would you agree to stand for a 
possible second term at the same ministry in the next government? 
  [Andreatta] I am optimistic by nature. So I can even 
envisage a victory by the moderate center, however unlikely it 
may seem. If that did happen, I would certainly accept.

<F P=106> [Antonio Velardi report: "De Mita's Revenge: 8,000 Votes </F>
in Runoff"] 
  [Excerpt] Avellino -- [Italian Popular Party--PPI--member] 
De Mita has scored a complete success in the first round. The 
mountains of Irpinia, his traditional fiefdom, have produced a 
flood of support votes with a view to next Sunday's [13 
February] runoff organized by the PPI's regional steering 
committee. This clear message from Avellino gave rise to some 
controversy following the halt called from Rome: "Hands off our 
candidate; Ciriaco remains our leader." Midday 10 February was 
the deadline for putting forward the candidates who will be 
subject to the vote by party members and supporters in two days' 
time. There were no less than 8,142 signatures in support of 
the former prime minister, put forward as a candidate for the 
lower house in the constituency that comprises all the 
municipalities of Upper Irpinia, including Nusco. 
  De Mita virtually doubled the number gained by another 
outgoing parliamentarian, Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, who 
gathered 4,322 signatures for the senatorial constituency of 
central Avellino. All the rest were out of the running. There 
were 2,341 votes for Giuseppe Gargani, chairman of the Justice 
Committee, competing for the Lower Irpinia lower house 
constituency; 1,820 for Ortensio Zecchino, the Popular Party's 
regional coordinator, put forward for the Upper Irpinia 
senatorial constituency; 1,006 for Gianfranco Rotondi, regional 
councillor, competing for the central Avellino lower house 
constituency. Rotondi is competing against Francesco Pionati, 
the television Channel 1 news reporter who also hopes to stand 
as a candidate but who has sharply opposed the runoffs, refusing 
to take part and describing them as "like some kind of San Remo 
[popular song] festival, where all the winners are known in 
advance." Gerardo Bianco did not compete in the first round 
either, having decided to stand down for good. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "f.gui.": "Moderates Seek To Conquer the </F>
South"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The other half of Italy has yet to be 
conquered. After the northern pact between [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi and [League Secretary] Bossi, the moderate alignment 
is closing the pincer of alliances in the south, too. The 
National Alliance, Forza Italia, and the Christian Democratic 
Center [CCD] will field joint candidates and symbols with a view 
to winning 195 seats in the lower house (out of a total 630), 
295 of them in single-candidate constituencies. An agreement 
has also been reached for the Senate, where, as the law 
requires, only one symbol will be used -- Forza Italia at the 
top, the National Alliance at the bottom, and the CCD in the 
middle. 
  The agreement was reached after a week of negotiations in 
Rome and Milan. In the evening the three forces' mediators 
would go to the via Veneto. It was in fact at the Majestic 
Hotel that they laid the foundations for a compromise that 
seemed to be within reach but that at the last moment threatened 
to collapse because of the former Christian Democrats' tantrums. 
But now in Lazio, and elsewhere too, anti-progressive voters 
will find their candidates associated with no less than five 
groups -- National Alliance, Forza Italia, CCD, Center Union, 
and Teso's Pact group, that is, the dissidents who broke away 
from [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. 
  It all started on 10 and 11 February, as IL GIORNALE is in a 
position to reveal. The first meeting on via Veneto was 
attended by [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini and 
Altero Matteoli for the Alliance and Domenico Lo Jucco and 
Marcello Dell'Utri for Forza Italia. When they met and spoke 
together the two sides realized that an agreement was possible. 
Together, they set out the guidelines for a possible agreement 
-- the prime need to defeat the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left], the reaffirmation of national unity, and the defense and 
reaffirmation of Western values. It is not difficult to see 
that these issues focus the chances of an agreement between 
those who believe in economic liberalism and those aiming at a 
form of Gaullism, naturally within the context of Western 
democracy. 
  The most difficult thing immediately proved to be the 
technical aspect of the agreement: Where and how are the joint 
candidates to be fielded? This, particularly since the accord 
has to be extended to the former Christian Democrats of Casini, 
Mastella, and D'Onofrio; Costa's Liberals; and Teso's reformers, 
disillusioned with Segni. The obstacle was surmounted by using 
as an example the Lazio region, where political and electoral 
interests converge. The subsequent meetings were attended, in 
rotation, by "Diakron" expert Gianni Pilo, Forza Italia Chairman 
Berlusconi himself, and the CCD's three representatives, Casini, 
Mastella, and D'Onofrio, always inseparable. 
  But two men went the whole distance -- Matteoli and Lo 
Jucco. 
The agreement was placed in jeopardy as late as Thursday, when 
the CCE [expansion unknown] protested because it considered its 
strength to have been "underestimated." It was late and the 
meeting was adjourned until the next day. Another intervention 
by Berlusconi resolved the conflict and opened the final, very 
long day -- from 1000 hours to 0200 the following morning. The 
MSI [Italian Social Movement] representatives shuttled to and 
from their National Directorate meeting in a state of shock, 
being in a clear minority. Everyone --from Casini to De Luca, 
from Biondi to D'Onofrio, and dozens of provincial and regional 
councilors -- came and went, either out of curiosity or seeking 
a place in the sun. There was agreement even on disagreements: 
Each force will compete on its own account in the 
constituencies of Benevento, Caserta, and Avellino. 
  Thus the National Alliance can avoid being accused of having 
included the former De Mita supporter, Mastella, on its list. 
The latter will compete probably only under his own symbol and 
that of Forza Italia. It is said that during the negotiations 
several representatives of Segni's Pact and of Martinazzoli's 
Popular Party either put in an appearance or spoke, frightened 
by the emergence of a center-right alliance. According to MSI 
members, "the Pact's Michelini was one of the most frightened." 
On the whole it was not possible to divide the pie strictly 
according to relative numbers. But, significantly, the National 
Alliance has 55 percent of the seats, Forza Italia 35 percent, 
and the CCD and the minor allies the rest. The percentages 
change from region to region. The Alliance is strong in Puglia, 
but weak in Sardinia, to cite just one example. Among other 
things, over half the Alliance's candidates will be not MSI 
members but individuals entering politics for the first time. 
  As though to "consecrate" the agreement, Berlusconi and Fini 
will run in Rome. The former will be a candidate on the 
proportional list in Naples and Palermo too, and the latter in 
Trieste and Bologna. What about Bossi? According to MSI 
sources, "When we registered our joint candidacy with Forza 
Italia at the Interior Ministry, the League's Patelli blanched 
and asked us: Does Umberto [Bossi] know about this?" Now the 
real election campaign is starting. Fini's spokesman, Francesco 
Storace, is wasting no time and has accused Segni of fielding 
Andreotti's son-in-law, Marco Ravaglioli, in Rome "in the name 
of rejuvenation."

<F P=106> [Report by Vito Biello: "The Economics of the Second </F>
Republic"] 
  [Text] A platform, be it progressive or leftist, already 
exists in a certain sense and will be made known very soon. A 
moderate or rightist one has yet to be created. It does not 
matter whether it is square, round or rectangular, for now 
political groups are watching this "program platform" which 
should show the way for the government program in the next 
legislature. 
  The progressive forces that gravitate around the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] seem to be going full speed 
ahead, strengthened by the successes in the recent 
administrative elections. Favored in the polls, propelled by 
unprecedented international acceptance, the Alliance is now 
facing its ordeal by fire, precisely that of its platform. "The 
government's program is going to come out of this," Occhetto is 
fond of repeating, "and it will decide who is in and who is 
out." The compatibility of the forces ranging from the Greens to 
Refoundation is up for discussion. 
  The economists of the oak tree [the electoral symbol of the 
PDS] insist that there is no turning back for the policy of 
reform. Occhetto professes moderation, D'Alema is the first to 
hint at a return of Ciampi, and insists on a "government of 
transition," but for the progressive forces, the proof of the 
pudding is around the corner. Among the moderate forces on the 
other hand, everything is up in the air. The political groups 
are thinking more about agreements and alliances than about 
programs. 
  The DC [Christian Democratic party] is preparing to become 
the Italian Popular Party, and the confusion is great; the other 
political groups regard one another at times with suspicion, or 
alternately offer the hand of friendship. Bossi and Segni, 
Berlusconi's (eventual) political party and the Popular Party 
exchange messages while waiting to make a decision. But on this 
front as well, the coming weeks will be decisive. 
  Therefore, it is time for some answers, beginning with those 
to the 10 questions posed by the Confindustria [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry]. 
  MONDO ECONOMICO listened to the views of Michele Salvati, 
leading economist of the PDS and author of its economic program; 
Maria Segni, leader of the Popularists; and Roberto Maroni, head 
of the group of League deputies in the Chamber.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michele Salvati, PDS economist, by </F>
Vito Biello; place and date not given: "Rigor Is Sprouting Under 
the Oak Tree"] 
  [Text] [Biello] Professor Salvati, what are the two or 
three essential points of the government economic program of the 
progressive area? 
  [Salvati] The first really essential point is the selection 
of the persons to head the government, and the principal 
ministers. Beyond all the statements of principle, it is much 
more important to the potential voter to have an idea of the 
team that will make the decisions. It makes a big difference, 
and the message is immediate, to entrust reform of the 
bureaucracy to Cassese instead of Gasperi, for example. 
  [Biello] Therefore, you believe it is useful to announce the 
names of the prime minister and the team along with the program? 
  [Salvati] In a sense, the names of the principal ministers 
are even more important than that of the prime minister. 
Precisely because the things that need to be done for this 
country involve primarily modernization and civility, and not 
questions of right or left, the persons selected are decisive. 
Everyone will say in their programs that the fundamental issue 
is state administration, reform of government finances; everyone 
will repeat a series of obvious key points. 
  [Biello] What distinguishes the progressive program from 
that 
of the moderates? 
  [Salvati] If I had to give a very general picture, I would 
say that, compared with the center-right, the moderate left 
should be more attentive to industrial growth and employment 
than to financial rigor. 
  [Biello] Rigor and resources. How will a progressive 
government operate? 
  [Salvati] The truth is that many of the measures that must 
be 
taken and on which a government of left-center should commit 
itself have little to do with the macroeconomic side, for which 
the road is rather obligatory. There can be some differences: 
for example, I believe that a government of the left would be 
less disposed to be the best pupil in the class in Europe, on 
monetary and financial matters, and instead would defend more 
strongly the interests of industry and workers in its own 
country. However, the important differences are to be found at 
the structural level, in the tax structure, government spending, 
reform of government administration. Let us be clear about 
rigor. The problem is the an eventual left-center policy runs 
the risk of being too rigorous. Let me explain with an example: 
did not a large part of all those votes for Fini in Rome come 
from government employees angry with Cassese? Is that not rigor? 
In effect, the policy of left-center recognizes on the one hand 
that not much can be done at the macroeconomic level, on the 
other hand it insists on measures of rationalization and 
structural reform that could be unpopular. 
  [Biello] You are saying that only a government of the left 
can carry out a policy of the right? 
  [Salvati] It is not a question of right or left. For 
example, 
if strong elements of equity and responsibility are introduced 
into the government administration, a work of justice is 
accomplished. This is almost a revolutionary decision for the 
left. The Cassese plan is justice and only justice: it completes 
equalization of working conditions in the public and the private 
sectors. So that today a bit of justice goes arm in arm with 
efficiency. 
  [Biello] And besides government administration? 
  [Salvati] There are situations that separate the two sides. 
Situations of real social hardships, such as dismissals, for 
example, about which the left cannot close its eyes and think 
that they need not be assisted. There are also certain requests, 
such as flexibility in lay offs, which certainly must be faced, 
but in a detailed way. A different matter is the attack on 
injustice, wherever it may be, at the fiscal level, the 
bureaucracy, or high incomes. Today we have a profoundly unequal 
distribution of income and the picture of industrial efficiency 
is desolate. Therefore, supervisory institutions such as the 
"Antitrust" or the Consob [Commission for the Supervision of 
Companies and Stock Exchanges] must be greatly strengthened. If 
there is to be rigor, it must be for everyone. 
  [Biello] Do you favor greater flexibility in the labor 
market? 
  [Salvati] I do not question certain measures of flexibility. 
For example, I would be in favor of encouraging "part-time" 
work, which is substantially ignored in Italy. It would be 
necessary to discuss others in detail, one by one. 
  [Biello] What do you think of the Confindustria decalogue? 
  [Salvati] I think it was an intelligent and timely political 
move. Seven or eight of those requests show good sense. The 
political significance however is: we will abstain from the 
immediate political struggle and evaluate the facts. It is a 
responsible and democratic position. 
  [Biello] But what would you respond to the specific points? 
  [Salvati] It would be necessary to go into it in detail. But 
for the most part, we would agree. 
  [Biello] What are the names of the government team? 
  [Salvati] For certain ministries I would not go further than 
those in the preceding government, partly to avoid problems. For 
others, it would not be difficult to find names. The problem is 
a different one, it is the creation of a new leadership class. 
  [Biello] And Ciampi? 
  [Salvati] He has been useful in this transitional phase. 
This 
has been an important government. What happened during this 
period was amazing: the government, passing the budget bill, and 
kept on its feet by the Lega and the PDS. 
  [Biello] But could this responsibility shown by the PDS have 
been only tactical? 
  [Salvati] If being tactical means being responsible, fine. I 
understand the perplexity of certain observers. However, I do 
not share certain very skeptical statements by a person I 
esteem, such as Andreotti. Some of his comments went too far: it 
is true that, following the logic of the past, the PDS played 
the game like all the others. But we are in a very different 
situation now: watch what the PDS does and judge it on that 
basis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mario Segni, leader of the "Pactists," </F>
by Vito Biello; place and date not given: "Neither With Reagan, 
Nor With the Man in the Street"] 
  [Text] The "Pactists": Segni speaks. His ideal is not the 
Iron Lady, Mrs. Thatcher. Neither is it the former U.S. 
president, Ronald Reagan. On the contrary, he is convinced that 
efficiency and solidarity are not antithetical. Mario Segni is 
not giving up, because he sees plenty of room for a political 
force in opposition to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. 
  [Biello] Well Deputy Segni, the progressive front has found 
its identity. Where are the "Pactists" looking? 
  [Segni] The current objective is to create a 
liberal-democratic and reformist group, an alternative to the 
PDS's leftist group. Therefore, I launched the Pact for National 
Rebirth, asking citizens for a million signatures. I explained 
the key points of my program clearly: those who agree with them 
can join the pact. I will never agree to place national unity in 
discussion, just as I have already said that the MSI [Italian 
Social Movement] or National Alliance is not an alternative to 
the PDS. 
  [Biello] Let us go to the economic program. What will you do 
about the budget? 
  [Segni] Spending must be reduced, but this does not mean 
destroying the social state. For many years it was said that 
efficiency and solidarity are irreconcilable; well, I want to 
build a state that is able to guarantee both requirements. For 
example, the South still needs assistance, but productive 
assistance, not welfare. 
  [Biello] Quite a challenge. Unless you are thinking about 
raising taxes. 
  [Segni] The tax burden absolutely cannot be increased, and I 
have proposed setting a 40 percent ceiling on rates. The 
obstacles that make the tax system a hindrance to development 
must be removed. And decentralization is needed that will give 
local administrations the means to govern. 
  [Biello] And the labor emergency? 
  [Segni] We must provide greater flexibility to the labor 
market, especially to facilitate entry into it, aside from 
eventual temporary departures. And we must invest in human 
capital.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni by MONDO ECONOMICO </F>
correspondent; place and date not given: "A Kinder Tax System 
for Those Who Invest"] 
  [Text] Maroni speaks. No to uncontrolled laissez-faire. Yes 
to a market economy that protects the weak, with a public 
presence limited to guaranteeing the rules. A less onerous tax 
system which burdens companies less. A fight against waste to 
reduce government spending. The Lega is prepared to accept 
alliances on its economic and political programs. Will it be 
Mario Segni? Will it be Berlusconi? "The turning point of the 
Congress was opening the door. We are ready to talk: it is not a 
take-it or leave-it document. But careful: time is short. A 
decision must be made by 15 January." Roberto Maroni is 
speaking, Umberto Bossi's right arm. 
  "Waste must be eliminated, the extraordinary assistance to 
the South, refinanced for 5 trillion lire. Social welfare must 
be limited, the system of assistance to firms reexamined. 
Government administration must be reformed. Not only by firing 
the loafers, as Segni says. The structure must be re-examined in 
order to improve services and cut costs." 
  [MONDO ECONOMICO] What should be the role of the state in 
the 
economy? 
  [Maroni] The public role must be eliminated. The state must 
guarantee respect for the rules. But it should be the market 
that makes the rules. That way, a real social state can be born, 
free of welfare abuse. The demise of the public presence must 
come about by privatization and a rewriting of the rules. But 
careful! Privatization must be real, actual publicly held stock 
companies must be created in Italy. I would not want to find the 
parties once again as owners, impersonated by Mediobanca 
[Financial Credit Bank], by the great families, by the friends 
of the friends. As for the rules, they must not be written only 
in the halls of Parliament, but with the collaboration of the 
interested persons. The hot subjects are: credit, Antitrust, the 
Mammi law and privatization. 
  [MONDO ECONOMICO] Firms are asking for a less onerous tax 
system. Are they right? 
  [Maroni] The tax system must be reformed, to make it more 
equitable and simpler. For firms, we are thinking not only of 
not taxing profits that are reinvested, but even about 
additional fiscal incentives for investors. And it must be done 
so that private savings are directed toward investing in 
companies. We have in mind the modernization of the stock 
exchange and the creation of local stock markets, more 
accessible to small companies. Perhaps that way the banks will 
stop behaving like usurers and be more ready to run a risk.

<F P=106> [Article by Marco Berti: "Surprise: The New Parties Are </F>
Liked by the 
People"] 
  [Text] Things new are liked. Citizens are becoming fund of 
politics again.They realize they are protagonists and want to 
participate. Resentment towards the parties has relented; there 
is interest and there is an effort to understand and cooperate. 
"There no longer is the bitterness, for example, when we used 
to mention the DC [Christian Democratic Party]...." says Giorgio 
Calo, director of Directa, a Milan institute specializing in 
opinion polls. Tangentopoli [Bribe City] has swept away an 
arrogant, corrupt political system that created hatred in the 
country. Now there is a new and evidently credible sense of 
involvement. "Today people may be confused, but they are 
certainly interested. They feel like they are participating in 
the creation of the new Republic," Calo said. 
  This is an important element that comes from the polls 
various institutes are conducting in view of the 27 March 
elections. The last poll conducted by Directa says that only 16 
percent of those polled is uncertain, doubtful, does not know 
what to do. The rest already know how they will vote. Of those 
who have already decided, 35.2 percent chose the progressive 
grouping, 30.7 percent chose the center of Martinazzoli and 
Segni, and 34.1 percent chose a coalition of the right (Bossi, 
Berlusconi, and Fini). Therefore it will be an election that 
will be decided by a thin margin. 
  Directa reached these conclusions after having interviwed 
1,300 individuals distributed throughout 98 localities, "with a 
double stratification, by geographic area and according to the 
size of the centers," Calo explained. 
  Separating certain data shows that Segni and Martinazzoli 
forming an imperfect balance at the center: 15.1 percent to the 
former and 15.6 percent to the latter. On the right, Bossi's 
League comes in at 13 percent, the Snake [Forza Italia] at 9.2 
percent, and Fini's National Alliance at 11.9 percent. 
  Where does Forza Italia, squeezed between the League's north 
and the MSI's [Italian Social Movement] south, place itself 
territorially? "The movement is well distributed throughout the 
country, but more so in the center-south," Calo explained. 
  The director of Directa adds: "In contrast to the last 
administrative elections, where the phenomenon of the politics 
of personality was clear, things are different in this election. 
Ideologies having gone out the door, values are coming in 
through the window. Certainly, the politics of personality 
continues, but mostly it involves the top leaders. Today the 
voters are facing off on democracy, the social welfare state, 
and free enterprise." The director of Directa therefore 
pinpoints three factors that will determine the victory or 
defeat of the various groupings: the impact of the leader, 
values, and what he defines as a "good product," that is, the 
quality of the candidate in the electoral college.

  [Text] Pressure is rising among the conflicting factions in 
Bosnia. Western leaders are all making statements about the 
situation and are saying that the NATO ultimatum will be carried 
through if the artillery weapons surrounding Sarajevo are not 
surrendered. One of the latest statements on the matter came 
from the U.S. defense secretary. William Perry stated that at 
the moment the military options are evident. But despite the 
strong stand, the international community continues divided. 
Russia has called for a UN Security Council meeting, which is 
due to take place within a few hours. The Russian diplomats say 
that air strikes should only go ahead if Sarajevo is shelled 
again. 
  The Russian deputy minister for foreign affairs is in Lisbon 
and spoke about the situation. He was evasive. More details 
from Pedro Leal: 
  [Begin recording] [Leal] Good morning Deputy Minister Sergey 
Krylov. What will be the stand defended by Russia at this 
afternoon's Security Council meeting? 
  [Krilov, in Portuguese] We will be defending our stand, 
which 
is that to start any sort of action it is necessary to continue 
carrying out all resolutions approved previously. 
  [Leal] Does that mean that Russia is against NATO's 
ultimatum? 
  [Krilov] It means that only the Security Council can issue a 
mandate. 
  [Leal] Do you mean that Russia will submit NATO's ultimatum 
to the Security Council's vote? 
  [Krilov] I would not say that. 
  [Leal] And what is Russia's intention in relation to the 
Bosnian issue? 
  [Krilov] Our intention is that it is necessary to continue 
this political line of promoting peace among the conflicting 
sides. 
  [Leal] Does that mean that you are against air strikes on 
artillery positions in Bosnia? 
  [Krilov] You must be well aware of the fact that the 
ultimatum itself has already produced results. 
  [Leal] Does that mean -- I will ask again -- that you are 
against strikes? 
  [Krilov] I believe that military force is the last resort. 
When we all give up, then it can be used. We still have [word 
indistinct] we still have the possibility of continuing with the 
negotiations. This is a better option. 
  [Leal] What will be Russia's diplomatic approach if NATO 
carries out its ultimatum on Bosnia? 
  [Krilov] We still have a few days left before that can 
happen, and it is necessary to use other possibilities. 
  [Leal] One last question -- what will you be discussing this 
afternoon at your meeting with Portuguese Minister for Foreign 
Affairs Durao Barroso? 
  [Krilov] I will only be able to tell you that after the 
meeting. [end recording] 
  That was Pedro Leal talking to the Russian deputy minister 
for foreign affairs, who is visiting Portugal [end recording].

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with General Luis Feliu Ortega, deputy </F>
commander of UN forces in Bosnia, and General Jose Antonio Leal 
Castillo, General Ortega's replacement, in Kiseljak, by an 
unidentified studio announcer -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Tomorrow in the Bosnian city of 
Kiseljak, the deputy head of the UN forces in Bosnia, UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces], will be relieved of his command. The 
Spanish General Luis Feliu is also the head of the Spanish 
contingent in former Yugoslavia. He will hand over to another 
general from our country, General Jose Antonio Leal Castillo. 
On the eve of the handover we contacted both military men. 
Good evening General Luis Feliu. 
  [Feliu] Good evening. 
  [Announcer] How has the conflict in Bosnia changed since you 
arrived on the scene a few months ago? 
  [Feliu] Well, once again we are at a critical juncture. And 
I say once again because exactly when I took over, at the end of 
July, an important cease-fire agreement was signed by the three 
military leaders and it should have been enforced once the 
Geneva peace agreement was signed. And then, I chaired a series 
of meetings held at the level of seconds in command of the three 
military factions also to develop this cease-fire agreement. 
[passage omitted] 
  Luckily, today there is a new glimmer of hope, an important 
glimmer of hope. There is no new cease-fire because 
theoretically the former one could still be enforced, but we do 
have reasons to hope for Sarajevo. There are beginnings of 
partial agreements on the withdrawal of heavy weaponry and this 
is important because it creates the conditions to reach -- maybe 
-- God willing -- a definitive peace agreement. 
  The work of the blue helmets has always been constructive. 
But many can object that nothing has been gained, nothing 
concrete. But I would tell them two things if I may. One, just 
think what would have happened if the blue helmets had not been 
there, think what would have happened without the humanitarian 
aid and without our presence. And secondly, the blue helmets -- 
and this is very important -- did not come here to impose peace, 
not even to negotiate it. We have to render humanitarian aid 
possible and create conditions favorable to a peace agreement. 
  [Announcer] So you made a positive assessment of the blue 
helmets' work. But do you agree with the criticisms made by 
some blue helmet commanders about how the UN forces lacked means 
to enforce international resolutions?. 
  [Feliu] Well, as for the first part of the question, yes, I 
do made a positive assessment because it has been so. [passage 
omitted]. 
  As for the criticisms, I say that first I do not normally 
comment on personal criticisms. And I do not think that I 
should criticize my immediate superior, in this case General 
Briquemont [passage omitted]. All of us would have liked to 
have more forces, or at least some more forces so as to be able 
to accomplish our missions better and avoid tiring or exhausting 
our units. 
  [Announcer] As you mentioned you are leaving Bosnia at a 
crucial moment, now that NATO has set an ultimatum to those who 
are besieging Sarajevo. How well is the security of the blue 
helmets ensured -- specially those closer to Sarajevo -- in case 
of air strikes? 
  [Feliu] No one can ensure -- and even less so in a war -- 
even though it is not our war, we are in a war -- 100 percent 
security. And the proof is that sadly our blue helmets have 
suffered casualties - and why not recall here the Spanish 
casualties. But I can say that all necessary precautions have 
been taken. If there were air attacks, they would be decided by 
the appropriate authorities and after an adequate analysis and 
examination, taking into account the situation. 
  [Announcer] General Feliu, tomorrow you will be succeeded in 
Bosnia as deputy head of UNPROFOR and head of the Spanish 
contingent by General Jose Antonio Leal Castillo who is also on 
the line with us. General Leal, good evening. 
  [Leal] Good evening. 
  [Announcer] What advice has General Feliu given you? How do 
you feel as you take on this job? 
  [Leal] Well, optimistic and full of good will. I have only 
been here for a couple of days. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] General Leal, right now international attention 
is focussing on Sarajevo, but there are other, many other 
flash-points in the Bosnian war. Are the Spanish blue helmets 
in Mostar suffering from any kind of marginal risk because of 
the ultimatum in Sarajevo? 
  [Leal] I do not think that there are any marginal or 
additional, risks for the Spanish contingent because of the 
ultimatum. All the measures have been taken to avoid these 
risks. 
  [Announcer] So if there were to be possible reprisals 
because 
of air strikes, the reprisals would not reach the Spanish 
contingent? 
  [Leal] I really do not think so. No, really not. 
  [Announcer] Is it your opinion, General Leal, that the 
solution to the war in Bosnia is an international military 
action or should this be part of a diplomatic solution? 
  [Leal] That is not a question I can answer particularly 
well. 
However, I believe that the solution to this war, like any other 
war, does not necessarily have to be military action. And I 
hope that it will be like that, for everyone's sake. There is 
always time to find a negotiated solution. 
  [Announcer] General Jose Antonio Leal Castillo and General 
Luis Feliu, thank you for answering this phone call from Radio 
Nacional and good luck in your new jobs.

  [Text] The Spanish Government will maintain its current 
level of official cooperation with Cuba in 1994, despite the 
difficult straits the Spanish economy is now experiencing. Jose 
San Gil, the Spanish ambassador to Havana, said that despite the 
economic difficulties which we are all going through I can 
assure you that the Spanish Government considers it a duty to 
maintain its cooperation this year. 
  According to the ambassador, Spanish cooperation from Madrid 
to Cuba amounted to approximately seven million dollars in 1993. 
This reflects the Spanish Government's political decision. 
Beyond the official interpretation, this should be seen as a 
mark of the interest and affection of the Spanish people. 
  Ambassador San Gil added that about 120 Cubans are trained 
or 
retrained every year in Spain. Furthermore, all the projects 
currently under way will continue.

  [Text] During a brief stopover in Madrid, Guatemalan 
Foreign Minister [Gladys] Maritza Ruiz de Vielman called for the 
support of the Spanish authorities for a peace agreement between 
the Guatemalan guerrilla movement and the government. Hector 
Arenas reports: 
  [Arenas] The Guatemalan Government has asked the Spanish 
Government for support to try to attain a definitive peace 
agreement this year in talks it is holding in Mexico with the 
guerrilla movement. Negotiations started in Spain, in El 
Escorial [near Madrid], a few years ago. The request for 
support was made by recently appointed Guatemalan Foreign 
Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielman during a short stay in Madrid, 
in which she held a meeting with Foreign Minister Javier Solana. 
The Guatemalan minister described the meeting as being very 
positive. 
  [Begin de Vielman recording] We find it positive that they 
are very favorable to the beginning of this new phase, and we 
believe that Spain will be among those countries watching this 
process closely, and that they will support us. [end recording] 
  [Arenas] Also, during this meeting Guatemala asked the 
European countries to lift present restrictions on the import of 
tropical fruit, especially bananas. Finally, the Guatemalan 
minister said that reports last week on the alleged plotting of 
a coup d'etat against President Leon Carpio were lies.

  [Text] Bill Clinton's Far East policy has taken another 
step in lifting the trade embargo which the United States kept 
imposed on Vietnam, thus ending three decades of hostilities 
with that Southeast Asian country. It is a decision consistent 
with the lines of opening to the enormous markets of the Pacific 
and Indian Ocean countries laid down by the Free Trade Treaty. 
  The fall of the Berlin Wall, the coming together of the two 
Europes, the end of apartheid in South Africa, the understanding 
between Jews and Christians in the Vatican and Jerusalem, and 
the agreements between the Israelis and the PLO -- to cite the 
most celebrated rapprochements -- have created a world 
atmosphere of peace and the elimination of barriers which 
separated people from each other for decades and even centuries. 
  Clinton has decided to end 30 years of confrontations 
between 
Hanoi and Washington. This will entail a high political cost 
for him in view of the wounds which that war inflicted on U.S. 
society, but he has paid more heed to the unanimous opinion of 
his advisers, including the military, who had been advising him 
to lift the embargo, and this shows his repeated concern to 
serve the cause of peace.

<F P=106> [Report by Ib Konrad Jensen and Jens P. Skaarup: "Folketing </F>
Demands Removal of Secrecy Surrounding Police Intelligence Work"] 
  [Text] Five years after the end of the Cold War, the 
Folketing is demanding greater openness in the PET [Police 
Intelligence Service]. 
  The service's surveillance of extreme political activities 
among the population and search for spies and terrorists is to 
be brought into the light of day. The inspiration for this lies 
in our neighboring countries, including the German Intelligence 
Service, which openly speaks about its work. 
  The special parliamentary control committee of five members 
is currently exploring how much access the public can demand 
without its jeopardizing the effectiveness of the PET's 
investigations, according to committee Chairman Svend Erik 
Hovmand (V [Liberal Party]). 
  The blanket of secrecy is today so thick that the public is 
allowed to know nothing of the budget, methods of investigation, 
or files on suspects. Even the control committee -- with all 
the parliamentary committees under the strictest pledge of 
secrecy -- has access only to the broad, general guidelines for 
PET's work. 
  Svend Erik Hovmand is assured of a majority for the idea. 
Two other committee members, Ole Espersen (SDP [Social 
Democratic Party]) and Jens Thoft (SF [Socialist People's 
Party]) have already expressed agreement. 
  "There is no reason whatsoever why the guidelines for PET's 
work, for example, should be kept from the public. In my 
opinion, around 10 out of almost 1,000 pages received by the 
control committee since it was set up in 1988 ought to be kept 
secret. As for the rest, if they were left scattered about the 
streets it would not matter," Jens Thoft said. 
  He has been jealously observing the open-door policy 
practiced by the German Intelligence Service. A quarterly 
account is published with information on the current threat 
situation and on the groups currently under surveillance. 
  "In a democratic country it is both reasonable and important 
that the citizens know as much as possible about the public 
institutions. That must also apply to the Police Intelligence 
Service," Svend Erik Hovmand said. 
  The head of PET, Chief Commissioner Birgitte Stampe, is no 
stranger to the idea. She has revealed that she is in the 
process of writing a folder on the PET similar to those already 
issued by the British MI5 and the Norwegian Surveillance Police. 
If Justice Minister Erling Olsen (SDP) is able to support the 
idea, the folder will be available later in the year at public 
libraries.

<F P=106> [Report by Ib Konrad Jensen and Jens P. Skaarup: "Numbers </F>
Employed in PET Have Grown by 733 Percent"] 
  [Text] The secret part of the police force, the PET [Police 
Intelligence Service], has been growing in explosive fashion, 
unnoticed, since the service was set up 41 years ago. Its job 
is to prevent attacks on state security. The earliest figures 
available are from 1958, and from 1958 to 1992 the number of 
policemen in the PET has risen from 33 to 242. 
  That represents an increase of 733 percent. By comparison, 
the police force as a whole has grown by only 153 percent over 
the same period, figures reached by SONDAGS POLITIKEN's study of 
the police staff analyses. 
  The more policemen employed at the PET, the greater the 
proportion of police working according to methods and budgets 
which are so secret that not even the Folketing's special 
control committee can find out anything about them. Only the 
very broad guidelines for the PET's work are presented to the 
committee. 
  A number of former justice ministers with whom SONDAGS 
POLITIKEN has been in touch say that the growth in the PET's 
staffing levels, and hence budget, has taken place without 
political interference. 
  "It is not the result of a politically driven wish to 
increase the staffing of the PET. It is a plan adopted by 
successive Danish commissioners of police, and one which I am in 
fact quite happy with. The world is after all no less troubled 
than it ever was," former Justice Minister Hans Engell (KFP 
[Conservative Party]) said. 
  Between 1982 and 1992 alone the numbers of crime police 
employed in the PET grew from 100 to 143. Of all the 
departments under the commissioner for police, that 
unquestionably makes the PET the one to have received most new 
resources. The flying squad, which helps the regional police 
forces to tackle the most serious crimes, has grown from only 68 
to 75 employees over the 10-year period. Another equally 
hard-pressed department, the fraud squad, has had its strength 
built up by a mere two detectives to a total of 32. 
  Chief Constable Birgitte Stampe, PET, justifies part of the 
growth in the service's personnel by citing two technical 
factors: A number of PET police were previously paid by the 
ordinary police force, but were later transferred to the PET's 
payroll. And since 1983 the PET has had to guard the members of 
the royal family and carry out other guard duties for people at 
risk. That takes 30 bodyguards. "Although I cannot give you 
any figures, it is true that these factors do not entirely 
account for the growth in personnel. But the remainder can be 
explained by the fact that intelligence work today requires more 
staff than before. That is the threat assessment picture," PET 
boss Birgitte Stampe said.

<F P=106> [Report by Tapio Vilkama: "Russia Is Number One in Trade </F>
With the East"] 
  [Text] Eastern trade today comprises trade with the 
countries of the former Soviet and Yugoslav blocks plus East 
Europe, including Albania: a total of 27 countries from the 
former socialist economic system. Last year, Finland's eastern 
trade reached a value of about 22 billion Finnish markkas [FMk], 
approximately 10 percent of the country's total foreign trade. 
Our eastern trade developed very favorably last year, with 
significant growth in several countries. 
  Russia represents about 60 percent of Finland's total 
eastern 
trade and 80 percent of trade with the CIS and the Baltic 
states. Russia's share of Finland's total foreign trade was, 
according to statistics for the period from January through 
November 1993, just under 6 percent. Russia is Finland's 
fifth-largest trading partner. 
  Trade with Russia, which shows a FMk2 billion deficit for 
Finland, increased by 43 percent over the previous year. The 
growth in Finland's total exports is partly due to the rapid 
expansion of food exports and the fact that re-exports via 
Finland have almost tripled. These two factors may account for 
one-fifth of our total exports to Russia. 
  Trading between Finland and Russia is based on a new MFN 
agreement based on GATT principles. 
  Economic cooperation between the countries, in addition to 
the trade agreement, includes a separate development program for 
the neighboring regions. It is within this framework that the 
authorities of the provinces of Lapland, Oulu, Mikkeli, North 
Karelia, and Kymi on the Finnish side and the Murmansk region, 
the Karelian Republic, the city of St. Petersburg, and the 
Leningrad region on the Russian side are trying to set up a 
basis for direct contacts between enterprises. 
<H5>  Capricious Regulations Interfere With Trade </H5>
  A stop was put to duty-free trading between Finland and 
Russia by a Russian decision in early December 1992. At that 
date, basic duty averaging 15 percent was imposed on Finnish 
exports. Last year, Russia raised the general duty percentage 
to between 20 and 50 percent. Finland, for its part, started 
levying general duty on imports from Russia as of 15 February 
1993. 
  Import duties have, however, not been a key factor in trade 
between Finland and Russia. Instead, problems are created by 
several other legal charges imposed by Russia, e.g., value-added 
tax and excise duties (especially on luxury goods), a number of 
compulsory, complicated, and excessively expensive certificates 
regarding safety, hygiene, radioactivity, and food products, in 
addition to continuously changing customs procedures. 
  Finnish capital has already been invested in some 500 joint 
ventures in Russia, most of them in regions near our border (the 
Leningrad region, St. Petersburg, Karelia, and Murmansk) and in 
the Moscow region. 
<H5>  The Commission Still Lacks a Head </H5>
  The Russian section of the Finnish-Russian Economic 
Commission has now been without a chairman for almost six 
months. We hope that a new Russian chairman can be appointed 
soon. Minister Seppo Kaariainen, the Finnish chairman, is 
planning a visit directly after the reorganization of the 
Russian Government in mid-January. An official visit to Finland 
by Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has also been in the 
offing for some time. 
  Russia's debt to Finland is FMk8 billion. The Russian 
Government has promised to study repayment arrangements through 
the sale of property and real estate assets in Russia or 
long-term deliveries of raw material. There is also a 
preliminary agreement on arrangements that would allow Russia to 
repay half a billion of its debt in the context of additional 
Finnish purchases of weapons. Private companies have also 
hundreds of millions of markkas worth of claims without 
securities. 
<H5>  Estonia Before Other Baltic States </H5>
  Trade between Finland and the Baltic states developed very 
favorably last year. Baltic trade, however, represents only 
about 1 percent of Finland's total foreign trade and 12 percent 
of our eastern trade. 
  Estonia is clearly the most important of the Baltic states 
and one of Finland's 16 most important export countries. 
Figures for trade with Estonia are greater than that for any 
East European country except Poland. Our trade with Estonia 
reached FMk2.3 billion during the period from January through 
November 1993. The trade surplus is FMk944 million in Finland's 
favor. Our trade with Estonia showed a clear growth last year. 
  Trade with Latvia and Lithuania remains on a modest scale, 
and there are only a few dozen joint ventures based on Finnish 
capital in these countries. 
  During the period from January through November 1993, trade 
with Latvia was worth FMk347 million while trade with Lithuania 
was worth FMk241 million, which places these countries in the 
same category as other former Soviet bloc countries. Latvia and 
Lithuania, with Ukraine between them, are next in order after 
Russia and Estonia. Our trade with Latvia and Lithuania grew 
somewhat more slowly than with Estonia, and imports from these 
countries increased faster than exports. 
<H5>  Advantages With KEVSOS Begin To Diminish </H5>
  East European countries represent about 25 percent of 
Finland's total eastern trade. Trade with Central East Europe, 
except for Romania, developed favorably last year. Most 
significant has been our trade with Poland, which ranks as 
Finland's 12th-largest export country. Trade with Poland rose 
to FMk3.1 billion during the period from January through 
November 1993, a growth of 20 percent over the previous year. 
  Trade with Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia showed 
a 
growth rate of a few dozen percent last year. Our total trade 
with Hungary during the period from January through November 
1993 was worth less than FMk1 billion. Trade with the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia was worth around FMk0.5 billion. Trade 
with Bulgaria and Romania, on the other hand, has remained 
minimal. 
  In the early 1970's Finland joined the so-called KEVSOS 
[expansion unknown] free trade agreements with Bulgaria, Poland, 
Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. The EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association] countries have now negotiated new free trade 
agreements with these countries and Romania. Finland's customs 
benefits under KEVSOS are due to be gradually phased out by 
2001, when the entire KEVSOS agreement will be replaced by an 
EFTA agreement.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Deryabin Received IKL Leaders"] </F>
  [Text] Russian Ambassador Yuriy Deryabin yesterday 
received the leadership of the Patriotic National League, IKL, 
at the Russian Embassy in Helsinki. The meeting lasted one and 
a half hours and came about as the result of an IKL initiative. 
  IKL is one of the two organizations that Russia demanded 
information about in a note prior to the first round of the 
presidential election. At the meeting the IKL leaders raised 
the subject of the note and the border question. The IKL wants 
to return to Finland the borders fixed in the Peace of Tartu 
[1920]. 
  The IKL leadership was satisfied with the discussion and 
described relations between the embassy and the IKL as 
businesslike. According to representatives of the organization, 
the meeting did not give the impression that Deryabin considers 
the IKL to be illegal or that the organization is in any way 
contrary to the Paris peace agreement. 
  The IKL gave Deryabin a clock made of wood, with an image of 
Finland with borders from the Peace of Tartu. The IKL 
leadership gave assurances that the organization does not 
represent a threat to Russia, nor does it intend to harm 
relations between Finland and Russia.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "EU Ready To Bargain Over </F>
Agricultural Demands?"] 
  [Text] According to reports from Finnish sources in 
Brussels, the EU [European Union] is showing signs of greater 
cooperativeness toward Finland's agricultural demands in the 
membership negotiations. 
  Finland wants the whole country to be classified as an 
unfavorable agricultural area and to therefore receive the EU's 
special support, LFA [less-favored areas], for such regions. 
  The EU has been unwilling to provide support for the whole 
country -- at most to Hame province northwards. However, it is 
now being reported that the EU side is showing greater 
flexibility on this point and is prepared to move the limit 
further south. 
  As well as LFA, Finland wants special Nordic support for 
agriculture, and here too the EU is said to be cooperative. 
However, it remains an open question what criteria should apply 
-- latitude or the short growing season. The EU has nothing 
against such support being paid in Finland, as long as it is 
paid for by Finland, but the Finns would ideally like to have EU 
money as well. 
  At Tuesday's [8 February] ministerial meeting the EU put 
forward its first negotiating bids in the agricultural field -- 
and these were rejected by all the applicant nations. But it is 
only now that the agricultural negotiations are beginning in 
earnest. 
  This week a working group consisting of agricultural experts 
from the EU countries has gone through all of the applicant 
nations' almost 400 negotiating demands in the agricultural 
field, to sort out the really difficult issues from the purely 
technical. 
  Around 40-50 difficult issues have been isolated, including 
the transition to EU prices, production quotas, and Nordic 
agricultural support. These questions will now be handed over 
to the EU ambassadors and foreign ministers for discussion and 
will be resolved -- if they are resolved -- in the final phase 
of the negotiations, at the marathon negotiating meeting from 25 
to 28 February. 
  The working group did not change the production quotas for 
milk and sugar that the EU Commission has proposed and that all 
the applicant nations have rejected as too low.

<F P=106> [Report by Hakon Letvik: "Norwegian Protest to France and </F>
the EU"] 
  [Text] Yesterday there were close contacts between the 
Foreign Ministry and the Fisheries Ministry to discuss how the 
Norwegian authorities can best protest against the wide-ranging 
bureaucracy and the minimum prices that are now being used to 
obstruct imports of Norwegian fish into France. 
  "Our embassy in Paris has been asked to contact the French 
authorities at the Foreign Ministry and the Agriculture and 
Fisheries Ministry. It will express regret at the tighter 
border controls that are doing major damage to Norwegian fish 
exports," Foreign Ministry press spokesman Ingvar Havnen said. 
  The French customs authorities are now demanding that 
customs 
documents and veterinary papers be in French, and veterinary 
checks at the border have been tightened up with the result that 
a number of tests are being carried out on Norwegian fish. 
Analysis of these tests takes up to five days, and consequently 
the French authorities have made sure this bureaucracy amounts 
to an effective obstacle to the sale of fresh Norwegian fish at 
an acceptable price. 
  Norwegian fish exporters will now try to clear their fish 
through Danish or German customs so as to avoid France's 
bureaucratic customs authorities. 
  The Foreign Ministry expects that Norwegian fish exporters 
will keep themselves well informed about the situation in France 
through their business contacts and their own employees involved 
in transport. "We do not therefore want to give any general 
advice about what they should do," Havnen said. 
  Despite the fact that Norwegian fish trucks were emptied of 
10 metric tons of fish under the eyes of the French police, the 
ministry does not have the impression that the police are 
neglecting to do what is possible to protect Norwegian fish 
trucks.

<F P=106> [Report by Aslak Bonde and Jan Gunnar Furuly: "Listened -- </F>
But Said Little"] 
  [Text] Reports from Brussels of a tougher French stance in 
the fisheries section of the EU [European Union] membership 
negotiations came at the same time as the country's European 
Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure began a round trip through the 
Nordic applicant countries. Yesterday he met the Norwegian 
prime minister, foreign minister, trade minister, and fisheries 
minister in separate meetings. 
  At a subsequent news conference, he used up so much time in 
speaking in general terms about France's desire to bring Norway 
into the EU, and there was no time to discuss in detail the 
problems in the negotiations. 
  It would not be right to say anything about France's 
position 
on Norway's fisheries demands before the EU countries have 
reached a common position, he said. However, Lamassoure 
stressed it was of crucial importance for the EU to arrive at a 
common fisheries policy. 
  "We have to arrive at a single Europe on fisheries, not two. 
Nevertheless, for a certain period we will have to look at what 
sort of transitional arrangements are needed," he said. 
  In the section of the negotiations on agriculture, the EU 
has 
agreed to reject the Norwegian demand for a gradual adjustment 
to the EU's agricultural policy. This runs contrary to the 
signals that Gro Harlem Brundtland and Gunhild Oyangen received 
during their visits to Paris a few weeks ago. 
  Nevertheless, Lamassoure did not think that Harlem 
Brundtland 
had misunderstood the situation in Paris: "There are some 
purely technical problems in these negotiations, but I do not 
think that we will have major difficulties reaching agreement on 
agriculture," he said. 
  If we are to be bold enough to interpret the French 
minister's words, this must mean that France could, when all is 
said and done, envisage supporting Norway on transitional 
arrangements for agriculture. However, an interpretation of his 
general remarks on fish is less optimistic. 
  The most probable interpretation is that France will go 
against Norway's demand that it retain control over fishing 
north of the 62d parallel -- in addition to demanding 
transitional arrangements on market access -- according to 
information received by AFTENPOSTEN in Brussels. 
  According to Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen, 
Lamassoure did not touch on the question of French transitional 
arrangements for Norwegian market access during the two 
ministers' meeting yesterday. Lamassoure largely used his 
half-hour with the fisheries minister to listen to the fisheries 
demands Norway is making in the negotiations with the EU -- with 
full market access from day one of membership and not a single 
fish to be given away in quota arrangements as the main points. 
The EU Commission will not make known its response to the 
Norwegian demands until 17 February. 
  Olsen is otherwise happy that France has again opened the 
door to fish imports from Norway, but wants to wait and see how 
the transport of fish will pass off in practice. 
  "Lamassoure gave assurances that customs controls will 
become 
a lot easier and that veterinary tests on loads of Norwegian 
fish will take a maximum of 24 hours," the minister said.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Hallvard Bakke, Storting member and </F>
leader of Social Democrats Against the EU: "Norway, the Nordics, 
and the EU"] 
  [Text] The arguments against Norwegian membership in the 
European Union (EU) are equally important no matter what Sweden 
and Finland do, according to Storting member Hallvard Bakke 
(Labor, Hordaland), the leader of Social Democrats Against the 
EU. 
  Ragnar Nordgren asked in ARBEIDERBLADET on 10 January if 
supporting EU membership if Sweden and Finland join is 
compatible with membership in Social Democrats Against the EU 
(SME). We do not scrutinize the hearts and minds of anyone who 
wants to join SME, but such an attitude is incompatible with 
SME's views. The arguments against membership are equally 
important regardless of what Sweden and Finland do. At the same 
time I do not see that Swedish and Finnish membership would 
introduce decisive new elements that would invalidate these 
arguments. 
  In our opinion, EU membership would lessen democratic 
influence on our own national development. It would be harder to 
combat unemployment, there would be greater disparities in 
Norway, Norwegian authorities would lose their influence on 
economic policy, it would be harder to preserve and strengthen 
the welfare state, and the labor movement would be weakened. 
Regional, resource and residential, and environmental 
considerations will be just as important even if Sweden and 
Finland become members. 
  It will also be just as important for us to be able to speak 
with our own voice in international organizations. If one 
believes that small countries can occasionally play a role 
precisely because they are outside the big power blocs and that 
the Nordic voice has made a positive contribution to the 
international community, this supports the argument that it will 
be more important for Norway to stay out of the EU if Finland 
and Sweden join, although I realize that Nordgren does not share 
this view. 
  In an article in ARBEIDERBLADET on 13 January, Peder 
Figenbaum saw fit to "remind" me that the most important reason 
why Norway is applying for membership is that our partners in 
the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have done so and that 
if Finland or Sweden says no, the Norwegian application will 
lose much of its purpose. He may be right that Norwegian support 
would then collapse due to the strong EU opposition in this 
country. But it is not correct that Norwegian membership depends 
on Sweden and Finland also becoming members. 
  Obviously it is important to clarify this matter. Therefore 
I 
asked party leader Thorbjorn Jagland last year if the Labor 
Party supports membership if Sweden and Finland do not become 
members. I was told that the party leadership had not yet 
discussed this. Later that year, in response to a similar 
question, deputy leader Jens Stoltenberg stated that the Labor 
Party supports Norwegian membership regardless of whether or not 
Sweden and Finland become members. 
  And that is the only logical position. It would certainly 
seem strange if proponents regard the usual arguments for 
membership -- that Norway "belongs to Europe," that we must join 
in order to influence EU policy, control financial forces, and 
change the EU in cooperation with other Social Democratic 
parties, as well as for security and environmental reasons -- as 
being so unimportant that they do not apply if Sweden or Finland 
remains outside. 
  Figenbaum presents some arguments suggesting that Finland's 
and Sweden's relationship are also important for us. He mentions 
the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, relations with our 
Nordic neighbors, and, the most important consideration for him, 
our relations with Europe. Figenbaum claims that the government 
views the EEA agreement as "absurd" if the other applicants 
become EU members. If so, it would mean that the government 
prefers a trade agreement of the kind we had up to 31 December, 
which also has Center and Socialist Left (SV) support. I do not 
think this is true and I do not know where Figenbaum thinks he 
got it from. 
  The EEA agreement expands free trade to include services and 
public tenders and also regulates competitive conditions so that 
they are the same within the entire EEA area. There is no reason 
why the EU should not want to have such an agreement with Norway 
and Iceland even if Sweden, Finland, and Austria become members. 
Figenbaum says our situation will be "pretty hopeless with an 
unguarded 1,300-km border with the economic and political 
superpower that the EU will undoubtedly be and only little 
Iceland to back us up." I do not know what kind of encroachment 
Figenbaum imagines Norway has to fear from the EU. Personally I 
have no doubt that the EU will continue to live up to its 
agreements and desire good relations with Norway. 
  In 1972, EC supporters said it would present no obstacle to 
expanded Nordic cooperation if Norway and Denmark became members 
and the other three countries remained outside. So it is hard to 
see that we could not have good Nordic cooperation now with some 
Nordic countries that are EU members and others that are not. 
And even if Sweden, Finland, and Norway should all become EU 
members, surely we will continue to include Iceland in Nordic 
cooperation. With respect to relations with the EU, if Sweden 
and Finland are members, we will have three close friends and 
neighbors inside the organization. Surely that would not make 
cooperation and contacts with the EU more difficult.

<F P=106> [Report by Tom Hansson: "Time Favorable for a EU Agreement"] </F>
  [Text] "I have a feeling that we are close to an 
agreement. The time is favorable, particularly with regard to 
the European Parliament. If we do not seize the opportunity 
now, it will be a parliament that is newly elected in June that 
will decide the matter. Things would then immediately become 
much more uncertain." 
  It was perhaps not intended as a contribution to the Swedish 
EU [European Union] debate, but the message was clear. Act now, 
was more or less what French European Affairs Minister Alain 
Lamassoure said when he gave a short news conference yesterday 
with his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Dinkelspiel. 
  At the invitation of the Swedish Government, Lamassoure has 
discussed issues in the negotiations with Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt, among others. One of these is Sweden's northerly 
location. 
  "We understand that the northern countries need some form of 
compensation and have reach the conclusion that Objective 1 
status could apply to Norway and Finland. But for Sweden we 
will have to find something else. Objective 5, perhaps, a form 
of support intended for regions that are threatened by 
depopulation. Or something else." 
  Grand French words were spoken about the importance of 
European cooperation, the significance of Swedish civilization, 
and our qualities in the diplomatic field. But there was also 
what was actually a rather gruff remark: 
  "The question of the Swedish contribution to the EU budget 
is 
a difficult one. Sweden is richer than the EU average and will 
therefore be a net contributor. We have learned a painful 
lesson from the British rebate and do not want a new exemption." 
  However, Sweden has not asked either for a rebate or for any 
exemption. At issue is a phasing in. But there was no time to 
ask questions about that.

  [Editorial Report] More expensive uranium imports are 
expected to cost the Swedish nuclear energy industry an 
additional 200-300 million kronor a year if the country joins 
the EU [European Union], according to a report by Ingrid 
Jagerhorn on page C1 of the 15 January Stockholm daily DAGENS 
NYHETER in Swedish. Since 1989, Sweden has imported about 45 
percent of its uranium from Russia at below market prices. 
According to EU quotas, however, each member may only purchase 
20 percent of its annual uranium supply from Russia. Because its 
use of nuclear energy fluctuates depending on the supply of 
hydropower, Sweden has been granted concessions allowing it 
flexibility in determining its annual uranium supply.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Nicosia O AGON in Greek on 9 February 
1994 on pages 16 and 17 carries a 3,380-word interview with 
Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, chairman of the Committee of Solidarity 
With the Kurds, by correspondent Niki Miltiadhou. The interview 
begins with Yeoryiadhis explaining how he got involved with the 
Kurdish problem, saying he became interested in it after 
learning the Turkish language and dealing professionally with 
Turkish issues. He and some friends, such as Lakis Pingouras, 
established the Committee of Solidarity With the Kurds in 1988. 
  The correspondent asks what the committee has done for the 
Kurds and Yeoryiadhis answers that it has done many things but 
he cannot say it has done what it should have done. 
  Responding to a question on how Cyprus can help the Kurds 
and 
how the Kurds can help Cyprus, Yeoryiadhis says: "The Kurds are 
already helping Cyprus by maintaining a war that keeps 350,000 
Turkish soldiers occupied. Two weeks ago, we saw the Turkish 
military service extended by four months, proving that there is 
a lack of personnel. Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller last 
week said that Greece is creating problems, therefore, it cannot 
pull its forces from the Aegean and move them to Kurdistan. 
This shows that the Turkish Army has its hands full with the 
Kurds and is not capable of making a second war against either 
Greece or Cyprus. 
  "Furthermore, the Kurdish revolution has blocked Turkey's 
dreams of resurrecting the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and 
Central Asia following the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Therefore, the Kurds help Cyprus by keeping the Turkish Army 
busy, that is by making the Turks incapable of expanding the 
invasion or starting a second war in Cyprus. 
  "Our help has been multifold. Beginning with the political 
aspect, friendly countries, such as Cyprus, must raise the 
Kurdish problem at international forums and condemn Turkish 
terrorism and violations of human rights. The international 
community must press the Kurdish issue. Parties, organizations, 
and the people in general must give practical and financial help 
to a nation that fights and safeguards our security. 
  "The Kurds in Turkey even attack the tourism industry and, 
as 
a result, we benefited last year. Our hotels were full last 
September and October with German tourists who would have gone 
to Turkey but finally came to Cyprus. This indicates that even 
our tourist sector benefits from this war." 
  Asked to compare the Kurdish and Cypriot struggles, 
Yeoryiadhis says: "You have answered this question yourself ... 
[ellipsis as published] There is no struggle and this is why I 
insist that since we are not fighting, we must at least help 
those who fight for us. It may seem unlikely that the Turkish 
Army in Cyprus will either be blocked because of an expansion of 
war and Turkish domestic problems or will have to withdraw. The 
latter option is possibly more unlikely because the reservists 
can cover their needs, but the possibility that the Army will 
stay blocked remains. 
  "We must see this and understand that our only way out is to 
respect the political factor that, on the one hand, causes 
Turkey's financial bankruptcy--the Turkish pound was devalued 20 
percent during a stock exchange crash--and, on the other, causes 
a political crisis. There is no government that can make a 
decision on a Cyprus solution. There is no willingness and this 
is the most basic issue." 
  Yeoryiadhis is then asked which countries support the Kurds 
and who helps them. He answers: "The Kurdish people, the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan], which was established in 1978 is 
based on a basic principle, the people's self-rule. It does not 
try to secure help from foreign countries so it does not become 
dependent. Foreign help causes dependence. We have the example 
of the Iraqi Kurds. Their continuous dependence caused the 
Kurdish people in Iraq to be destroyed. 
  "Kurdish assistance mainly comes from the Kurdish people 
themselves, the immigrants. There are about 1.5 million Kurds 
in Europe alone. Kurdistan's National Liberation Front has some 
300,000 active members in Europe who contribute to the Kurdish 
struggle. Assistance from others in the international community 
is not ruled out." 
  Discussing which countries are friendly toward the Kurdish 
people, Yeoryiadhis remarks: "There is a significant opening in 
Europe. Greece is friendly toward the Kurdish struggle, as is 
Cyprus, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries, Austria, Italy, and 
Spain. Basically, the only countries that oppose the Kurds are 
France and Germany, which follow the Turkish policy on the 
Kurdish issue because of interests in Turkey." 
  Asked how the Americans see the Kurdish struggle, 
Yeoryiadhis 
replies: "The Americans oppose Turkey's division because they 
consider it a factor of stability in the Middle East, a factor 
against Iran and Islamic fundamentalism. But, they obviously 
favor the creation of a political state, particularly in 
northern Iraq." 
  Asked to comment on the declaration of war against the Kurds 
by Turkish Prime Minister Ciller, Yeoryiadhis says that such 
declarations are common but various Turkish officials give 
different dates as to when a new offensive will begin. 
Yeoryiadhis adds: "There is some confusion on an exact time 
because they try to hide the real picture and avoid world 
reaction. The developments, though, show the opposite. 
Turkey's economy is continuously being destroyed and there is a 
political crisis." Furthermore, Yeoryiadhis says: "It seems 
that Turkey will not make it [against the Kurdish uprising] to 
the year 2000. This year, the Kurds will strongly attack 
tourism in Turkey, aiming at exhausting its economic resources, 
mainly foreign currency, so that it will not be able to finance 
the war against them." 
  Yeoryiadhis is then asked to explain why there are so many 
Kurds in the occupied part of Cyprus, since the Kurds are at war 
with the Turks. He responds: "The Turks' basic policy is to 
evict the Kurds from the Kurdish areas to minimize the war. 
They have emptied and destroyed more than 800 Kurdish villages 
in Kurdistan. They do the same thing with the other 
nationalities in Asia Minor. There have been forceful movements 
of people since the Ottoman Empire. There were many 
nationalities that simply disappeared with these movements. The 
same thing happened in the genocide of the Armenians. In 
addition to those they slaughtered, one million Kurds were moved 
to the Syrian desert to be destroyed. The Turks are nomadic 
people. They moved from Central Asia to Asia Minor and also 
within Asia Minor. Movement is something natural for the Turks 
and the Kurds. They do not react to the movement. They do not 
understand the characteristic of localism and are not bound to 
the land in the way we say, `this is my village.' Anyway, the 
basic problem of the Kurdish people throughout history has been 
the lack of national consciousness. Their ancestors were the 
Medians [from Media, ancient name for the mountainous area in 
Asia between Armenia, Assyria, Persia, Parthia, and Ukraine]. 
  "Indeed, there are Kurdish settlers in the occupied areas of 
Cyprus who came after the 1974 war or fought in this war. 
However, many Kurds go there to find work or because of their 
expulsion from Kurdistan. However, this should not be used as 
an excuse against helping the Kurds because there are only a few 
settlers the Kurdish movement condemns as associates of the 
Turkish state. On this issue, there is a relevant statement by 
PKK General Secretary Abdullah Ocalan to Greek Cypriot 
correspondents who visited their camp in the al-Biqa' Valley in 
1991. These settlers actually are fanatic Muslims, belonging to 
the fascist party of Alpaslam Turkes. However, these people were 
used for settling the occupied areas at the beginning, even 
before the Kurdish movement was founded in 1978. The mass 
settlement of Kurds was based on a plan in 1974-76. But there 
are also Greek-speaking Pondians in the occupied areas. This 
could be a positive thing, as a base for us in the occupied 
areas. There are also Kurdish soldiers in the occupation army 
because military service is obligatory. Unfortunately we do not 
capitalize on this."

  [Text] During a joint news conference today with Alfred 
Serreqi, his Albanian counterpart who is officially visiting 
Greece, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said the resumption 
of the Athens-Skopje dialogue depends on whether the well-known 
prerequisites set by Greece are accepted. 
  Papoulias expressed reservations about the stabilizing role 
that Skopje can play, a view supported by Serreqi. 
Specifically, using the word "Macedonia," Serreqi described 
Skopje as a factor of stability in the region. Papoulias 
stressed: With its constitution, symbols, and unceasing 
propaganda, Skopje is strengthening those circles that do not 
want peace and stability in the region. He noted: If Skopje 
does not accept Greece's conditions, the dialogue will be 
suspended, as the prime minister has said. The Greek position 
cannot be misinterpreted. 
  The Albanian foreign minister is visiting Athens within the 
framework of political dialogue between the European Union [EU] 
and Albania. During their meeting, Papoulias and Serreqi 
discussed Albania's relations with the EU, its accession to 
various programs, and support for its effort to democratize and 
change institutions. 
  The two ministers also discussed the crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia, especially the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Serreqi said the Albanian Government supports NATO's decision 
on air strikes against Bosnia-Herzegovina and added that Tirana 
disagrees with dividing that country into three parts. 
  Asked of the Albanian Government's draft bill on education, 
which is expected to include provisions for the teaching of the 
Greek language, Serreqi said the provisions of international 
treaties and the CSCE will be considered.

  [Text] By choosing the role of world terrorist and 
troublemaker, NATO does not even maintain any pretenses. In the 
game of "acquiring vital countries" in the Balkans, it even 
cancels the now-pretentious international security mechanisms 
for stability and balance, such as the UN Security Council. And 
in order to make its decisions "legal," it does not even 
"tolerate" suspicion under any motive. Therefore, to Russia's 
proposal for an emergency convening of the UN Security Council 
to examine NATO's decision for bombings in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the United States and France reacted by claiming that it was 
useless because NATO's decision is already covered by the United 
Nations! No reservation "will prevent implementation of the 
decision," cynically said the French Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard. This is a statement that indicates the mercilessness 
of international imperialism and the sham role of international 
organizations, which tend to become mouthpieces of the 
"powerful."

<F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister George Rallis by TO </F>
VIMA political editor N. Nikolaou: "Prime Minister Mitsotakis' 
Tragic Mistakes"] 
  [Excerpt] The deadlock our country faces today in our 
foreign policy -- and particularly our isolation in the Skopje 
issue -- originated in the tragic mistakes of the Mitsotakis 
government. However, the then-opposition, which is today the 
government, bears serious responsibilities because it, too, 
focused on the question of the name [Macedonia]. 
  These views were expressed by former Prime Minister G. 
Rallis 
in an interview given to TO VIMA. The former prime minister 
urges the political leadership to agree on a consensual policy 
to find a realistic solution. 
  G. Rallis in his interview with our political editor N. 
Nikolaou speaks also on the government's policies up till now 
and finds that A. Papandreou is not keeping his promise to offer 
equal treatment under the law to all citizens, but instead he is 
bringing back the partisan way of thinking in the Army, the 
civil administration etc. 
  Here is the text of the interview. 
  [Nikolaou] The government has already completed three months 
in power. It may be that it is too early to assess its work 
(although in the economy much has already been done), but it 
would be useful to have an evaluation of at least the "style" of 
the new government. 
  [Rallis] I was hoping that A. Papandreou with the 
experiences 
of his previous eight-year term as prime minister and with the 
knowledge that this is his last term as prime minister -- 
regardless of the likelihood of his moving to the presidency of 
the republic -- would this time keep the promise he gave right 
after the 1981 electoral victory of the Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement [PASOK] that he would be the prime minister of all 
Greeks -- a promise he soon forgot. 
  The disappointing fact is that, unfortunately, not even now 
is he going to carry out this promise which, in any event, is a 
self-evident democratic principle for a parliamentary prime 
minister. Already from the very first days of his new prime 
ministership, it appears that in all political decisions the 
partisan spirit is prevailing and that in the end he surrenders 
to that spirit. 
  It is not necessary to emphasize how destructive the 
perpetuation of this tactic is for our country. 
  [Nikolaou] But has he given any signs of such a divisive 
policy? What specific instances do you have in mind? 
  [Rallis] I want to believe that this tactic of going along 
with this partisan mentality is not his deliberate personal 
choice. What is important, however, is that regardless of his 
intentions the harmful effects are there and more are coming at 
a time when, because of the many and critical problems facing 
the country, it is imperative that we avoid upheavals and that 
we promote instead peace and tranquillity. 
  But the events of the last days in December in the sector of 
city transportation in Athens and in the armed forces show that 
the need for calm, especially at this moment, is hardly 
understood. [Passage omitted] 
  [Nikolaou] Let us move now to the armed forces. By what 
logic 
did the present government not have the right to recall to 
active duty officers who were removed for purely partisan 
reasons? 
  [Rallis] I would like to make a few comments regarding the 
events in the crucial and sensitive sector of the armed forces 
and of the police. In July 1974, immediately after the fall of 
the dictatorship, the former government of national unity faced 
a tremendous problem caused by the seven-year dictatorship 
especially in the armed forces. In spite of those difficulties, 
the government of national unity managed to deal with the 
situation by recalling to active duty only one high-ranking 
officer, Lieutenant General Dionisios Arbouzis. Many other 
excellent officers were in retirement, such as Peridis and 
Erselman -- to speak only of those who have passed away -- but 
there were many others too. Nevertheless, the former government 
decided that for the good of the armed forces it should not 
recall them to active duty. With this policy the government 
restored and secured not only legality but also order and 
discipline in the armed forces. The beneficial effect was soon 
evident in the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, which became 
indeed strong and battle-ready. 
  Today's government, when it took over two and one-half 
months 
ago, faced no similar problems nor did it face any unrest in the 
armed forces. Therefore, it had no reason to replace their 
leadership. In any event, the military leadership -- namely the 
chiefs of the four general staffs and the commander of the armed 
forces [Stratia] -- should be replaced only in the event they 
refuse to implement the government's defense policies. Such a 
problem did not exist. The government's view of a multiparty 
military leadership with representation from all parties and 
other new-found ideas are totally unacceptable. The cadres of 
the armed forces do not belong to political parties nor do they 
act in a partisan way. Free, democratic citizens vote for the 
candidates of their choice, but they belong to the armed forces 
and to the nation, not to political parties. Nonetheless, the 
government has recalled to active duty several retired general 
officers in all three weapons, four of whom took over the post 
of chief in the General Staff of National Defense [YEEThA], the 
Army General Staff [YES], the General Staff of the Air Force 
[YEA] and the General Staff of the Navy [YEN]. And let me say 
that it is possible that all four are good officers but I do not 
think that they are better than the two I mentioned earlier. 
  As General Verivakis, the former chief of YEEThA, correctly 
said, the return of the retired officers to active duty has 
indeed created a major issue in the ranks of the officers and of 
the armed forces in general. Self-respect and the unrest caused 
many resignations harmful to the cohesion, the strength, and the 
defense capabilities of the armed forces. Personally I would 
agree with those resignations. But I cannot but appreciate the 
honest and courageous decision of those who resigned sacrificing 
their career to uphold the ethical code that must guide the 
officer corps. I cannot understand why Air Force General N. 
Kouris, the present deputy minister of defense, did not protest 
this partisan domination of the armed forces, which brings back 
to our country the mentality and the political climate of 
national discord between the World War I and II, which brought 
such calamities to the nation. And I must say that I have 
personal knowledge of General Kouris' abilities because of my 
work with him when I was prime minister. 
  [Nikolaou] The New Democracy [ND] government had recalled 
retired officers to active duty, and in fact some of them had 
served in the military police [ESA] during the dictatorship as 
stated recently in the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Rallis] Yes, the ND government had recalled to active duty 
two retired general officers of the Air Force, and appointed 
them as chief and deputy chief of the Air Force general staff. 
It should have avoided it. In any event, there is a great deal 
of difference between that and the actions of the PASOK 
government this time. First of all, only two officers had been 
recalled then, and only in the Air Force. Most important, those 
two officers were not party cadres as is the case today. It is 
generally known that the Navy officer who was recalled to active 
duty and was appointed chief of YEEThA was until the eve of his 
recall a member of the PASOK Central Committee. 
  Regardless of the abilities and the qualifications of the 
recalled officers, and for some of them I have many 
reservations, the fact that immediately after their retirement 
they had become active PASOK party cadres should have ruled out 
any thought of bringingh them back to active duty. Never before 
has a similar action taken place and indeed to such extent not 
only in the armed forces but also in the police, even in the 
fire-fighting corps. Retired officers were chosen for their 
leadership, too. 
  This is an unbridled effort to bring the party into those 
crucial sectors which are directly related to our national 
integrity and social protection, at a time particularly critical 
for our country. 
  [Nikolaou] Which were in your view the mistakes of the 
previous government with regard to Skopje? 
  [Rallis] In my opinion, it was a very serious error that 
from 
the beginning the main -- the excessive, I would say -- focus 
was on the name of the small state, and that the proper emphasis 
was not given to the question of the borders, the Constitution, 
the flag, and the propaganda which I believe were much more 
important than the name. 
  We fought with such a policy on a problem which the 
foreigners -- especially our European partners and the Americans 
-- cannot understand to the degree we wished, while at the same 
time we encouraged inside the country a not only useless, but in 
many ways dangerous nationalistic paroxysm. 
  For the small Skopje state, without historical and cultural 
tradition, the name, even unwarranted, and the language, even if 
manufactured, constitute the only foundation for a separate 
state existence. I do not underestimate the significance of the 
name, nor do I ignore the ulterior motives it conceals. But the 
development of a specific threat we could have averted and 
eliminated through international guarantees and especially with 
the strengthening of our domestic front in all sectors. 
<H5>  Errors of Strategy and Tactics </H5>
  [Nikolaou] On which specific areas do you find the erroneous 
moves of the Mitsotakis government? 
  [Rallis] The moves of the government were unfortunate in 
several areas including (a) it did take advantage of the 
opportunity offered by the Pineiro Package; (b) after the 
removal of Samaras from the Foreign Ministry, the former 
government, instead of taking advantage of the opportunity to 
proceed with a "mid-course correction," continued with increased 
zeal the policies of the dismissed minister in full agreement 
with the former opposition; and (c) the government did not 
assess properly the alternative solutions as well as the 
possibility Skopje had to bypass the European Union. 
  So, without a community plan which could have been an 
improved version of the Pineiro Package we were left to face the 
difficult problem alone, relying only on the "community 
solidarity" which is effective only when it is invoked by our 
strong partners. 
  [Nikolaou] What were the consequences of our haphazard 
policy 
on Skopje? 
  [Rallis] The consequences of this policy were clearly 
negative from the point of view of organizing the strategy and 
tactics for the effective defense of our national rights and the 
safeguarding of our country's interests. But there were also 
adverse consequences as a result of our policies including (a) 
the almost total concentration of our foreign policy on the 
Skopje issue, at the expense of any other constructive effort 
that could be undertaken for our country and any opportunity 
that came along in the new order in the Balkans and (b) 
essential weakening of our position on the coming developments 
of the Cypriot problem, especially at a time when the Cypriots 
ask for our most active assistance. 
  In closing, I would like to say, sadly, that the Skopje 
issue 
is going from bad to worse for us, with the danger that we may 
not achieve what previously was given to us, as it has happened 
before in the Cypriot issue, too. 
  We are reaping now the bitter harvest of our mistakes. But 
who is to blame? The present government accuses the previous 
government and today's opposition accuses the government. No one 
accepts responsibility on his part. But it is certain that they 
are all to blame -- government and opposition. It is at least 
hypocritical for one party to blame the other. This is an 
attitude which does not serve the national interest -- I would 
say it is harmful instead -- nor does it bring honor to the 
political leadership and neither does it upgrade our political 
life. 
  The fatigue caused to the international community by 
prolonging this issue and the damage from this continuing 
deadlock cause haphazard and unrealistic moves. This situation 
should have forced the political leadership to agree at last on 
a consensual policy (which we often advocate but never 
implement) to find a realistic solution to this problem, a 
solution which of course will safeguard our interests. 
<H5>  The Mistakes of Prime Minister Mitsotakis </H5>
  [Nikolaou] The recent developments on the Skopje issue with 
the diplomatic recognition of this state by six countries of the 
European Union show that the policy followed primarily by the 
previous government was leading to an impasse. How do you 
evaluate more generally this policy? 
  [Rallis] In April 1992, while I was addressing the Chamber 
of 
Deputies on the Skopje issue, and in June of the same year in a 
joint statement on this issue with seven other personalities, we 
tried to turn the policy and the actions of the former 
government on this national issue to the right direction, 
without weakening our country's bargaining position. 
  I had foreseen even then -- with accuracy, almost 
prophetically -- the adverse developments for Greece which 
followed and which unfortunately continue with painful 
consequences. Neither my efforts nor my specific warnings had 
any positive effect. 
  [Nikolaou] Your proposal was not accepted by the government 
at that time. Was this the reason that led eventually to 
resigning as parliamentary deputy? 
  [Rallis] The way things were going my worries intensified. I 
could not approve the actions of the government and -- even less 
-- I could not agree with the demagogic and jingoistic policies 
of the opposition, which had forced the ND government to a 
policy of impasse on the Skopje issue. PASOK is equally 
responsible for this deadlock. 
  So I decided to resign from my parliamentary position on 
March 29, 1993, just before the voting on the Skopje issue 
shortly after midnight, with a letter addressed to the president 
of the Chamber of Deputies.

  [Text] Ankara--The "Agreement to Improve Friendship and 
Multisided Cooperation Between Turkey and Azerbaijan," which 
President Suleyman Demirel and President Geydar Aliyev signed on 
9 February, included the principle of a security guarantee and 
reconfirmed earlier agreements to market Azerbaijan's oil 
through Turkey. 
  The 10-year agreement, which was signed the day before 
yesterday, can be summed up as follows: 
  a. As friendly and fraternal countries, the two sides will 
promote their bilateral relations and safeguard each other's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, including 
the nonviolation of each other's borders, in accordance with the 
UN Charter. 
  b. The two sides will quickly establish the mechanisms 
required to promote cooperation in the political, economic, 
cultural, social, and other fields with a view to further 
strengthening their relations. 
  c. The two sides will maintain uninterrupted high-level 
contacts on bilateral relations and international issues. 
  d. In accordance with the accepted legal principles and 
norms in international relations, the two sides will try to 
improve bilateral cooperation in every field. They will quickly 
move to effect the necessary legal arrangements for that purpose. 
  e. The two sides reaffirmed that occupation of territories 
by the use of force and acquisition of international recognition 
or legal status for occupied territories is inadmissible. 
  f. Stressing that safeguarding the territorial integrity of 
the regional countries will contribute toward establishing 
peace, stability, and security in the Caucasus, the two sides 
will closely cooperate and help each other on those issues on a 
bilateral level and within the framework of the international 
organizations of which they are members. 
  g. If one of the two sides is attacked by a third country or 
countries, the other will take the necessary measures to help it. 
  h. While taking measures individually to maintain their 
national security and solve their defense problems, the two 
sides will exchange information and cooperate to carry out 
mutual activities [karsilikli faaliyet] within the framework of 
their close friendly relations. 
  i. The two sides will attach importance to promoting 
relations between their parliaments. 
  j. The two sides will create opportunities for establishing 
relations between their political, social, and economic 
establishments and for exchanging delegations between them. 
  k. The two sides will draw up a more favorable system for 
cooperation in trade and in the economic and financial fields. 
  l. The two sides will create the conditions required for the 
exchange of technological information and for investments to 
promote their economy. 
  m. The two sides will work to improve their free market 
economy system by exchanging information on and experience of 
economic reforms and their efforts to improve their economic 
management systems. 
  n. Reconfirming the agreements they reached on transit and 
transport through their territory in the past, the two sides 
agreed to conclude separate agreements for additional 
arrangements in that field. 
  o. The two sides adopted various decisions to promote their 
cooperation in the communications, fine arts, and cultural 
fields.

<F P=106> [Report by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--Turkey's human rights record has suffered 
another blow with an increasing number of deaths and abuses 
occurring in the past year, according to a recently issued 
report by the Ankara-based Turkish Human Rights Association 
(IHD). In announcing these findings in its 1993 annual report 
the IHD said that because of the rapid increase in human rights 
abuses, this year it would begin issuing reports on a monthly 
basis. 
  The association said that in 1993, attacks by security 
forces 
on groups and individuals increased as did extrajudicial deaths 
(killings by security forces without due legal process), 
especially in Istanbul. In the Southeast 3,750 civilians were 
killed and 1,490 wounded in ongoing clashes and there is still 
no solution in sight to the Kurdish problem. 
  The association, whose report concentrated on alleged rights 
violations by the security forces and state agencies, did not 
refer to deliberate attacks on civilian targets by the outlawed 
Workers Party Kurdistan (PKK). It did, however, accuse Ankara 
of hiding Turkey's economic and social realities behind the 
excuse of terrorism. 
  No mention was made in the report of the PKK's systematic 
campaign in the southeast which targeted engineers, teachers, 
students and civil servants, but association sources said that 
in 1994, such activities would be closely monitored. The 
commentary noted that 1993 had been a negative year regarding 
democratization and human rights and said that "day by day 
Turkey is being dragged into darkness." 
  It continued that all criticism of current economic, 
political, social and cultural policies was regarded by the 
authorities as a criminal offense and that any struggle for 
rights was faced with new bans and oppression. 
  The report also noted that the debate on capital punishment 
had resurfaced in 1993 and that nothing had yet been done 
regarding the formation of a ministry of human rights as had 
been promised by the coalition government. State Minister 
Mehmet Kahraman has recently threatened to resign if the 
proposed ministry is not established. 
  Observers have said that in the past, governments had been 
very keen to declare their opposition to human rights abuses 
while at the same time denying that there have been any 
violations. The failure, however, to establish a human rights 
ministry, is cited as the main obstacle in proving that the 
coalition government is sincere on this issue. 
  The IHD's 1993 human rights summary listed 21 people 
suspected of being killed by police torture and 29 people who 
"disappeared" while in detention. 
  The report also said that in 1993, a total of 510 people had 
been killed in "mystery murders," a reference normally used to 
explain political assassinations in which the killers escape. 
It said six journalists, three of whom were working for the 
pro-Kurdish OZGUR GUNDEM newspaper, were killed along with eight 
newspaper distributors. 
  A total of 51 journalists were imprisoned in 1993, while in 
the 1992-1993 period 260 newspapers and magazines were seized. 
Some 33 books were banned from publication and all copies were 
confiscated. Journalists and authors were sentenced to a total 
of 231 years imprisonment and fined TL 21000 billion. The 
report noted than in 1993, four political parties had been 
closed down while cases were being prepared for the closure of 
two others. The defunct parties were identified as the 
Socialist Party (SP), the People's Labor Party (HEP), the 
Socialist Turkish Party (STP) and the Freedom and Democracy 
Party (OZDEP). The Socialist Unity Party (SBP) and the 
Democracy Party (DEP) now face the threat of closure. A total 
of 48 associations were closed down in 1993. 
  The report said that during security operations in 
southeastern Turkey, security forces had evacuated a total of 
874 villages and hamlets, of which some were torched to prevent 
them from being used again by the villages. It also said the 
situation in the region was deteriorating. 
  The IHD is an independent organization whose main function 
is 
to monitor Turkish human rights violations. The Human Rights 
Foundation (TIHV) which is more institutionalized, concentrates 
mainly on the rehabilitation and treatment of torture victims 
and publishes its own annual reports. In 1993, a total of 323 
people applied to the TIHV for medical treatment and to 
participate in rehabilitation programs for torture victims. Of 
these, 115 applied in Ankara, 107 in Izmir and 101 in Istanbul.

  [Text] Ankara--The actual foreign investment flow into the 
country amounted $770 million in the January-October period of 
1993, ANATOLIA News Agency reported, quoting figures from the 
Treasury Undersecretariat. 
  The Treasury authorized foreign capital investments in the 
country worth $61.9 million in the first month of 1994. January 
1994 witnessed a 73.5 percent increase in the amount of foreign 
investment for which permission was given, compared to the same 
month in 1993. The value of total foreign capital investment 
given permission for by the Treasury in 1993 reached $2.27 
billion. This amount totaled only $1.81 billion for all of 
1992. During the period 1980 to October 1993, the Treasury had 
authorized foreign capital investments of over $12.5 billion, 
while only $6.4 billion of foreign capital actually flowed into 
the country. 
  Treasury data reveal that out of the $51.9 million in total 
foreign capital investments given permission for in January, 
Japan was given permission for investments worth $20.6. The 
United States ranked second with $16 million, followed by 
Switzerland which was given permission for investment of $3.1 
million. 
  Meanwhile, foreign investment incentives between 1980 and 
October 1993 amounted to TL 147.5 trillion, the Treasury data 
disclosed.

  The decision said, "mentioning of the solidarity and

<F P=106> [Article by Isabelle Graviere: "Snail-Paced Negotiations </F>
Between Brussels and Tokyo"] 
  [Text] Concurrently with its talks with Washington, Tokyo 
is in the midst of a similar process with Brussels, albeit in a 
less conflict-laden style, without it being necessarily more 
productive. A high-level meeting could take place in April. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura flew into Brussels 
from Washington yesterday night. He was due to meet this 
morning with Jacques Delors, [European Union Commission] 
president, as well as with Horst Krenzler, EU director general 
for external economic relations, to inform them of the 
U.S.-Japan trade talks which broke down this weekend. There are 
now regular contacts between Brussels and Tokyo "so that," 
according to Japanese diplomatic circles, "no discussion goes on 
in Washington without Europe been kept informed." 
  Nevertheless, the Europeans also hope to take advantage of 
this situation to review their own trade relations with Japan. 
The overall framework was established in July 1991 with the two 
parties signing a joint statement which, among other things, 
tentatively provided for an annual meeting at the highest level. 
A few days later an agreement was concluded according to which 
the Japanese agreed to voluntarily limit their car exports to 
Europe. This remains the only specific trade agreement between 
Japan and Europe. This is the reason why the Twelve felt a need 
to review a number of sectors in which European firms believe 
their market share in Japan is insufficient as compared to their 
worldwide performance. 
<H5>  Meeting Tentatively Scheduled for April </H5>
  The process -- known by its English acronym "TAM" [expansion 
not given] -- began last winter. First, it seeks to identify, 
sector after sector, the fields in which European exports to 
Japan are markedly lower with respect to world markets. Then, 
it focuses on the reasons for such variations in the hope of 
remedying them. Completion of the list, which includes dozens of 
industrial and service activities, is due soon. Then, concrete 
conclusions will have to be drawn at a ministerial-level 
meeting, tentatively scheduled for the month of April "if the 
political situation in Japan allows." But between the 
statistical exercise -- in which the Japanese have proved quite 
willing to cooperate -- and a hypothetical political decision 
regarding the opening of Japanese markets, there is a gap which 
is unlikely to be crossed easily, despite the low profile 
assumed by Europe over the past two years as a result of its 
decision to focus on dialogue rather than conflict.

  [Text] Brussels, NATO, February 14 (BTA) -- Bulgarian 
President Zhelyu Zhelev signed the document on Bulgaria's 
joining the Partnership for Peace plan in Brussels today. 
Bulgaria is the eighth country to join it. 
  "I would like once again to hail NATO's readiness to open 
itself to the security problems of East Europe and to admit new 
members in the future. I hope that the process of evolution 
starting with Partnership for Peace will be based on equal 
treatment and respect for the lawful interests of the partners 
in the area of security, and that the provision of security 
guarantees in the future will be considered," President Zhelev 
said at the ceremony in Brussels. 
  In his speech Mr. Zhelev described Bulgaria's joining the 
Partnership for Peace plan as a stage of its sovereign policy of 
integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Mr. 
Zhelev said that "the Republic of Bulgaria already a NATO 
partner, will pursue its sovereign course to full membership in 
NATO." 
  President Zhelev specially stressed that "Bulgaria's 
arguments for its participation in NATO do not contain elements 
that could be interpreted as being directed against Russia." 
"On the contrary, we support Russia's democratic and reformist 
forces and wish them success. We are convinced that NATO is in 
a condition to find adequate ways and means for Russia to become 
committed to European security, without encouraging the imperial 
ambitions of certain would-be dictators," Mr. Zhelev said. 
  Speaking of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, 
President 
Zhelev said they were a challenge to Bulgaria's security and 
caused -- through the international sanctions -- formidable 
difficulties for this country's economic reform. "Bulgaria's 
policy to the Yugoslav crisis was and remains principled, 
consistent, peaceful and inspired by good intentions. I am sure 
it will be given credit by our Western partners, by all 
civilized and democratic countries," Mr. Zhelev said. 
  "I am convinced that the North Atlantic alliance has made a 
good choice by seeking a new type of security in integrated 
Europe through the joining of the new democracies. This is a 
momentous process which helps democracy strike strong roots in 
East Europe and bear fruit that will not have a bitter after 
taste for the people who overthrew communism full of hope, 
self-confidence and a firm belief in a worthy future that the 
West would support," the Bulgarian president said about 
Partnership for Peace. He pointed out that for Bulgaria, the 
concept of security has military, as well as economic, social, 
political and humanitarian dimensions. Mr. Zhelev recalled that 
the idea of cooperation with NATO meets with broad public 
support in Bulgaria, and that Bulgarian Parliament was the first 
in East Europe to adopt a special declaration on the Partnership 
for Peace plan. 
  Mr. Zhelev stated that Bulgaria is ready to adjust its 
defense policy to that of the European democracies, the United 
States and Canada. 
  President Zhelev said Bulgaria is the only East European 
country invited to join Partnership for Peace, which borders on 
two NATO members in the Balkans -- Greece and Turkey. He added 
that Bulgaria had reached a good level of cooperation in the 
political, economic, military and military-technical sectors 
with them. "Its most valuable asset is a remarkable 
`transparency' in relations, which transcended the measures 
envisaged in the Armed Forces in Europe Treaty so that we 
ourselves expanded them on a bilateral basis," Mr. Zhelev said. 
He also pointed out that "Bulgaria cannot remain indifferent to 
the fact that the military balance in the Balkans does not match 
the new political realities in so far as some Balkan countries 
have not acceded to the European agreements and therefore their 
arms are not under control." 
  President Zhelev is expected back in Bulgaria tonight.

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Montgomery] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, February 14 (BTA) -- With all the 
solemnity of the occasion, President Zhelev signed the document 
at NATO headquarters this afternoon that will enter Bulgaria 
into the Partnership for Peace. 
  "It went well," said the president in an exclusive interview 
at the end of his flying visit to Brussels. He spoke to the 
local representative of BTA in very good English at the 
luxurious villa of Ambassador Leah Cohen, before he caught the 
airplane back to Sofia. 
  "I'm satisfied, I'm happy, I think it was a good thing for 
Bulgaria, for its national security in the long run. There will 
be a gradual integration of Bulgaria into the European 
structure," President Zhelev said. 
  At NATO headquarters, Zhelev met with the deputy secretary 
general, Sergio Balanzino, because the secretary general, 
Manfred Woerner, has had three operations for cancer in the last 
year and is still recovering from the last one. The agreement 
Zhelev signed is the standard form admitting Bulgaria to the 
process of association without full membership. It has already 
been signed by the leaders of Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, 
Poland, Romania, Ukraine and Slovakia. Bulgaria was thus the 
eighth country to sign, later the same afternoon Latvia became 
the ninth. 
  At a news conference later at Ambassador Cohen's villa in 
the 
richest part of Brussels, with the local police waiting outside 
in the tree-lined streets on motorcycles to escort his limousine 
to the airport for the airplane home, Zhelev was pressed about 
the situation in Bosnia. He called the NATO threats to attack 
Serbian artillery around Sarajevo an "act of peace" and 
expressed the hope that it would have a sobering effect on the 
combatants. 
  When he had a brief glass of Bulgarian wine before getting 
into his limousine, the BTA correspondent asked him about the 
political situation in Bulgaria. He said he thought there would 
be elections at the end of this year. Asked if there would be a 
coalition with the Turkish political interests, Zhelev said it 
was too early to tell.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor, in </F>
Moscow] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister will today take the lead in 
helping to give Russia a say in the world's largest and most 
influential club -- the exclusive G7 group of the world's 
wealthy industrial nations. 
  He will promise President Boris Yeltsin that he will back to 
the hilt Russia's determination to enter the political, although 
not the economic, dimension of the group. 
  But this move, spearheaded by Britain, could if successful 
end centuries of distrust and suspicion that the West to this 
day still feels about Russia. 
  And it could mean the end of the East-West divide which 
still 
cuts Russia off from capitalist Europe. 
  John Major flew into Moscow late last night for crucial 
talks 
with Mr Yeltsin in the Kremlin. 
  Both agree that Russia's rocky economy makes it impossible 
for her to become a fully fledged member of G7 -- for a while 
anyway. 
  But Mr Major feels -- and he will probably find that a 
majority of his G7 colleagues think likewise -- that Russia 
should now be allowed to get a foot in the door. 
  British officials had denounced as "cynical" suggestions 
that 
it is merely a sop to buy off Russia to ensure her support for 
Nato's threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. 
  Russia's centuries of affinity with the Serbs makes her 
reluctant to support any "muscular" action against them. 
  But Mr Major hopes today to persuade the Russian leader that 
air strikes, if the Serbs refuse to remove their heavy artillery 
from the outskirts of Sarajevo, could be one way of ending the 
bloody civil war. 
  Russian will almost certainly come "onside" although with 
reservations. In any event they have no veto so the air strikes 
could go ahead even with opposition from the Kremlin. 
  Mr Major and Mr Yeltsin are on extremely cordial terms. This 
has a lot to do with the fact that it was Mr Major who was the 
first of all the world's leaders to back Yeltsin during the 
aborted coup in 1991 and again during the attempted and failed 
insurrection last autumn. 
  Mr Major will seek from Mr Yeltsin information on the 
progress of Russia's massive programme of economic reform and 
the gradual introduction of privatisation throughout industry. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Major has made plain that he does not want to 
be questioned by reporters about back-to-basics and kiss and 
cuddle MPs during his joint news conference with President 
Yeltsin later today. 
  Mr Major is insistent that the objectives of his visit to 
Russia should not be overwhelmed by problems on the domestic 
front. 
  If these questions do arise at the news conference, 
indication is that the Prime Minister will decline to answer 
them, saying that he will only take questions relating to his 
visit. 
  Mr Major flew into freezing Moscow last night wearing a 
typically Russian-looking furry hat. But it was disclosed that 
he bought it at a hatters in the West End of London. 
  Mrs Major, who is accompanying him, also wore a furry hat 
and 
a striking brown and red coat. She was presented with a bouquet 
of flowers when she arrived last night. 
  During today she will attend some of the functions with the 
Prime Minister but her programme will also include a visit to a 
children's hospital, particularly a burns unit in it, and to the 
Bolshoi ballet school. 
  Tonight she will attend with him a "grand dinner" in their 
honour at the Kremlin. Mr Major will make a brief speech before 
the meal highlighting President Yeltsin's success in 
transforming Russia's economy and his personal courage in 
dealing with violent attempts to depose him and his government.

<F P=106> [Speech by "Federal Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt to </F>
representatives of French business and administrative circles in 
Paris on 3 February"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  I. I was very pleased to be invited to speak to you here in 
Paris. </H3>
  A close dialogue between the French and the Germans is 
essential, especially now, when Europe faces serious economic 
problems. In the second half of 1994 and in the first half of 
1995, Germany and France will chair the European Council. That 
underscores the necessity of close cooperation. 
  Last year, especially in connection with the GATT 
negotiations, much of the media reported discord in the 
Franco-German relationship; there was even speculation about a 
possible rupture. 
  In all these reports, however, too little attention was paid 
to the fact that the successful conclusion of the GATT 
negotiations was only possible because in the end Franco-German 
cooperation functioned once more. The breakthrough on critical 
issues only came about because there was agreement between Paris 
and Bonn. 
  There are, of course, differences on certain topics and, of 
course, different interests. That was always the case, and that 
will also be the case in the future. What is decisive is that 
despite these differences, the Germans and the French are both 
on the same track and are pushing in the same direction. 
  It is important that we reached a compromise on the GATT 
negotiations. The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round is 
a positive signal to the world economy, one that we need 
urgently. I personally am pleased that German's support for 
French interests in the Uruguay Round has also received 
recognition here. 
<H3>  II. France and Germany are gradually emerging from a 
serious recession, but we will nevertheless be confronted with 
high unemployment over a long period of time. That is because 
the current level of unemployment is not only a consequence of 
the recession, but is also to a significant degree of a 
structural nature. Both our countries must address this 
structural change. </H3>
  To some extent, Germany and France differ in their strengths 
and weaknesses; in Germany, for example, medium-sized companies 
perform a more significant role in innovation and employment 
than in France. 
  Both our countries are equally affected by the fact that 
they 
will have to deal with changes in the world economy. Other 
countries, especially in Asia and Central and East Europe, have 
become more competitive over the past few years. The 
globalization of markets and increasing economic integration 
have also made competition over industrial locations even 
fiercer. 
  Both our countries still lack pioneering companies that are 
at the forefront in the development of new technologies. 
Production costs must be kept under control in both countries. 
It also seems to me that there is a danger in both our 
countries of excessive regulation within society and the economy. 
  Of course, other European countries have similar problems. 
However, I consider it important that France and Germany develop 
stimuli to surmount these problems. Thus, we must see to it 
that our businessmen do not "vote with their feet" and look for 
other locations. 
  This leads us to reflect on the principles of the social 
market economy and improve conditions for more employment in 
Germany. The Federal Government report on securing Germany's 
future as an industrial location, which was drawn up by my 
ministry, contains an appropriate strategy. 
  A number of steps have already been taken: 

  -  We have 
reduced the taxation of revenues derived from commercial 
activity to bring it into line with the much lower international 
level; 
  -  Procedures for obtaining permits in the construction and 
transportation sectors have been greatly simplified; 
  -  It has been 
decided to proceed with a reform of the German railroad 
network; 
  -  It is hoped that the same will also shortly apply to 
the second part of the reform of the postal service, which will 
involve transforming German Telekom, the postal service, and the 
postal service bank into joint stock companies, and present 
monopolies will only be retained for a limited period of time. 
  The action program for more growth and unemployment, which 
was approved by the Federal Government last week, will serve as 
a basis for the implementation of further measures over the next 
few months. The following points are of particular importance: 
the continued consolidation of the budget and the introduction 
of more flexibility into the labor market. 
  For both our countries, it is particularly important that we 
pursue the consolidation of public budgets vigorously. That is 
the only way in which investors and consumers can recover 
confidence in the future. That, in conjunction with a moderate 
wage policy on the part of partners to collective agreements, is 
a precondition for granting our central banks more room for 
maneuver with respect to reducing interest rates. 
  The consolidation of public budgets must be attained through 
strict discipline with regard to expenditure. This means that 
we have to refrain from pursuing public programs involving 
considerable expenditure. Only by exercising strict discipline 
with regard to expenditure will we be able to create more leeway 
for lowering taxation, especially for companies and people on 
low incomes. 
  This means that we also have to introduce changes to our 
social welfare system. In Germany, such expenditure amounts to 
about 1 trillion German marks, that is, about one-third of the 
national product. 
  This ultimately means that we need administrative reform in 
our countries. In other words, we should not only talk of "lean 
production" in industry, but also achieve a "lean 
administration." We will only accomplish this by simplifying 
administrative and permit procedures and reviewing the great 
number of legal regulations. 
  We are also in the process of making the labor market more 
flexible. An important step in this regard is the separation of 
working hours from machine operating hours. We are making 
appropriate adjustments to labor law; we should also consider 
whether the regulations concerning labor law that have been 
approved in Brussels are flexible enough and take account of 
modern requirements. 
  The public monopoly on employment agencies will be 
disbanded, 
and it will not be possible for commercial companies to be 
active in finding jobs. 
  We will also start an offensive aimed at creating more 
part-time jobs. The demand for part-time work has been far from 
satisfied, and there is great potential for employment in this 
area. 
  The redistribution of the employment that is available and 
reductions in working hours are frequently cited as a recipe for 
overcoming unemployment. I do not see such measures providing a 
long-term solution. Reductions in working hours, even if they 
are combined with a corresponding reduction in wages, can only 
provide an interim solution that gives companies a necessary 
breathing space. 
  There can only be an incentive for more employment if better 
use is made of employment potential and if we introduce more 
flexibility into working conditions. This imposes demands on 
the partners to collective agreements above all. The corset of 
collective agreement provisions is too rigid and inflexible for 
today's circumstances. 
  What is needed today is more flexibility, more personal 
responsibility, and more participation in decisionmaking in the 
workplace. This means, for example, a differentiated approach 
to wage policy solutions that will vary according to region, 
branch of industry, and individual companies; more consideration 
should also be given to wage components based on company 
earnings. 
  Policy on collective agreements should prove itself, 
especially in difficult times. There have been promising ideas, 
in, for example, the chemicals industry. 
<H3>  III. At the end of 1993, Brussels came up with initiatives 
for overcoming structural and growth-related weaknesses in 
Europe. I welcome the Commission white book and action plan. 
Many of the contents accord with those in our Federal 
Government report; that is particularly true of the suggestions 
for a new direction in wage policy and more flexibility. </H3>
  The question of finance has to be dealt with before the 
program for creating trans-European networks can be implemented. 
It should be financed within the framework of existing 
instruments, because finance in the form of a loan through the 
EU budget is not compatible with the necessary reduction in 
national budget deficits. We cannot do what we consider wrong at 
the national level in Brussels, namely, increase the level of 
public debt. 
<H3>  IV. What can France and Germany do jointly in the current 
situation: How can they support each other in overcoming 
economic weaknesses? </H3>
  I believe that there are three key areas in which we should 
pursue action: 

  -  First, economic cooperation between our two 
countries must be intensified; 
  -  Second, both our countries must 
jointly promote European integration; 
  -  Third, both our countries 
must work together to expand the multilateral system of trade. 
  The first point: Economic cooperation between our two 
countries must be intensified. France and Germany are very 
closely linked to one another economically; we are each other's 
most important trading partners. Airbus is a model example of 
Franco-German cooperation that functions well, cooperation that 
has involved the participation of other European partners. 
  At this point, I would like to thank French companies for 
their involvement in the new laender. French companies are 
among the first. In Trust Agency figures, they occupy first 
place, both in terms of investment promises -- over 5.4 billion 
German marks -- and promises regarding the number of jobs that 
will be safeguarded -- over 25,000. What matters now is that 
these promises are carried out reliably. 
  Despite these close links, problems regularly arise in our 
cooperation; in addition, difficult economic circumstances 
result in an increased tendency toward the adoption of national 
solutions. Close and good cooperation is all the more important 
in times such as these. 
  Cooperation between companies is something that companies 
themselves must decide about; it is not a matter for the 
government to decide about. What we can tell companies is that 
we welcome such cooperation. 
  Frequently, the problems encountered in cooperation are the 
product of misunderstandings, because the economic systems in 
our two countries are based on different traditions and 
experiences. It is true that France places more emphasis on the 
participation of the state, whereas we give the marketplace and 
competition a greater say in determining production and demand. 
  We proceed from the assumption that the state and society 
cannot predict the future, let alone determine the future: I 
think that Hajek was right when he talked of the 
presumptuousness of knowledge in this regard. That is why we 
find the marketplace process of searching so important in 
finding the right path and preventing us from concentrating 
excessively on the supposed "only solution." 
  That is because we must often acknowledge that there is no 
one correct path, but that our strength stems from the diversity 
of ideas and from competition between different ideas. That is 
why I attach so much importance to the subsidiarity principle, 
which promotes diversity. 
  I can see that in this respect the French and German 
positions are close to each other. The best example is the 
privatization of nationalized companies in France. 
  The problems that we still encounter in understanding each 
other can be disposed of if we talk to each other openly and if 
we intensify contacts by, for example, actively exchanging 
officials and through closer cooperation between companies. 
  Something that is very helpful is the work of the 
Franco-German Working Party for Promoting Competitiveness, which 
is led by ex-Minister Fauroux and Secretary of State Eekhoff of 
my ministry. 
  There is also a special working party for the 
telecommunications field now. It is to deal with bilateral 
problems in the telecommunications field; they include the 
include the financing of research and development and employment 
policy issues above all. In addition, the working party is also 
to examine opportunities for closer cooperation against the 
background of the plans for cooperation between France Telecom 
and Germany's Telekom. 
<H3>  V. The second key area for action: Both our countries must 
work jointly to promote European integration; they must fulfill 
their traditional role of being the engine of European union: </H3>
  a. France and Germany must work together to prepare the path 
leading to economic and monetary union. 
  Economic and monetary union is an essential political goal: 
It will yield trade and competitive advantages and will have a 
stabilizing effect on the global monetary system. 
  The tensions in the European Monetary System were a 
reflection of economic policy disparities in member countries. 
Incorrect exchange rates were adhered to for too long and that 
upset currency markets. 
  For that reason, at the end of June, France and Germany 
jointly put forward an initiative for expanding margins of 
movement within the European Monetary System; the initiative 
proved to be correct. Not only has speculation subsided, but 
almost all the currencies participating in the monetary 
mechanism have returned to their old margins. 
  In addition, with the convergence programs that they 
proposed 
jointly, France and Germany have sent the right signals to 
indicate that more of an effort has to be made to promote 
economic policy convergence among member-states. For the 
Federal Government, the strict convergence criteria and the 
independence of the European central bank constitute the 
cornerstone of economic and currency union; that is something 
that we should not doubt. 
  We are pleased that France has accorded the Banque de France 
independence so resolutely and quickly. The international 
financial markets have rewarded that: The current yield on 
long-term bonds in France is even below that of comparable rates 
in Germany, but short-term interest rates are still somewhat 
higher. 
  The decision to base the European central bank in 
Frankfurt/Main is a great sign of confidence in our monetary 
policy, the goal of which is stability. I wish to express 
thanks for French support. 
  b) France and Germany must work together to make the 
community introduce a comprehensive initiative for deregulation 
and reductions in bureaucracy. That also accords with the 
intentions of the white book. 
  There is much in European guidelines and directives that is 
too detailed, and there are some things that are superfluous. 
There are many things that should be left to member-states, if 
only in keeping with the subsidiarity principle; that also 
applies to the administrative implementation of community 
legislation. 
  In addition, we require a review of much community 
legislation to establish those areas in which there are 
excessive restrictions on private initiative and in which the 
costs borne by citizens and companies are too high. I am 
thinking of, for example, the detailed regulations on product 
safety, the guidelines on liability in the provision of 
services, the energy consumption guidelines, as well the 
obligations to provide statistical data, which are formulated in 
a perfectionist manner. Moreover, not all that is desirable can 
be justified in economic terms. 
  The principle of mutual recognition is an appropriate 
instrument for guaranteeing the free movement of goods and 
services in a way that takes account of the subsidiarity 
principle. This has been evolved by the European Court over 
many years of rulings and has already been reflected in numerous 
pieces of legislation. 
  c) France and Germany must promote institutional reform 
within the European Union. The expansion of the union makes 
this issue all the more pressing. 
  The governmental conference that is planned for 1996 must be 
used to find suitable solutions. The conference should 
contribute to reducing the lack of democracy within the 
community. The further along the path of integration we find 
ourselves, the more important it becomes that the European 
Parliament should exercise effective democratic control over the 
community. 
  d) France and Germany should also work to ensure that the 
reformist states of Central and East Europe board the "European 
boat." The reformist states are destined to be successful; the 
opportunities for achieving a transformation can only be 
realized if we cooperate successfully. 
  Our slogan must be "trade instead of assistance." We should 
not view the reformist states solely as rival industrial 
locations, but as new, expanding markets right next door to us. 
Sales and investment in those countries can also strengthen our 
own competitiveness. 
  The Federal Government supports the gradual admission of 
Central and East Europe into the European Union. We should not 
abandon these countries. 
  The first step has already been taken. By opening up the 
community for goods from the reformist countries, an opportunity 
has been created for these countries to integrate with the world 
economy. I support the conclusion of partnership and 
cooperation treaties with the CIS states and the conclusion of a 
free trade treaty with the Baltic states. 
  In addition, we should not depart from the slogan "trade 
instead of assistance" in those areas in which the reformist 
states could greatly increase exports at the present time, 
although there is overcapacity in the European Union in those 
very areas. Sensitive areas in particular will show how serious 
we are about integration, even if it is not possible to open up 
the market in every field immediately. 
  We cannot continually solve the problems that we are 
experiencing as a result of structural change at the expense of 
countries that we ourselves are calling on to institute 
fundamental structural changes, irrespective of the fact that a 
policy of closing off markets would be very short-sighted. 
<H3>  VI. The third key area of action: France and Germany must 
continue to work together to promote the further development of 
a liberal, multilateral system of world trade. </H3>
  Even if our countries' interests differ in certain areas, as 
countries that export, we both need open markets all over the 
world. For this reason, regional cooperation should not be 
allowed to undermine multilateral trade. 
  A multilateral system of trade is also the essential overall 
framework for regional associations. We will see to it that the 
associations recently formed in the Pacific Basin and North 
America will also observe the principles of open, multilateral 
trade. 
  We, for our part, must also ensure that the European Union 
remains an open free market economy in which there is free 
competition in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty. That is 
why the Federal Government opposed "upgrading" the European 
Union's trade policy instruments by reversing majority 
requirements. 
  Germany and France differed in their positions on this. We 
also managed to achieve a compromise in this area: A simple 
majority on the European Council will be sufficient for the 
introduction of antidumping and compensatory tariffs. 
  The commission has not, however, been granted new powers. 
This should not happen as long as the community's democratic 
base has not been strengthened. 
  France and Germany must also look at the new issues that 
have 
arisen in the global economy jointly. In view of cross-border 
investment and the worldwide activities of global players, the 
multilateral system of world trade must also be complemented by 
the introduction of international guidelines on competition. 
  The issue of "trade and the environment" must also be 
addressed. The protection of the environment is to a large 
extent a global problem that can only be solved through a global 
approach. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, you can see that the agenda for 
Franco-German cooperation is extensive. I am convinced that 
there is much that we can accomplish together. 
  We can jointly initiate the right steps leading to new 
growth 
in Europe and the world. We should make that our task.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur by </F>
Francois-Henri de Virieu, Alain Duhamel, Albert du Roy, and 
Jean-Marie Colombani; from the "Hour of Truth" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [de Virieu] [passage omitted] My first question 
is on the tragedy of Sarajevo. It is clear that the Serbs are 
very reluctant to hand their heavy guns over to the United 
Nations. Does this mean that, if they do not hasten the 
handover of heavy artillery, we will decide to bomb them when 
the ultimatum expires next Monday [21 February]? 
  [Balladur] [passage omitted] We have made multiple efforts 
to 
bring the parties to negotiate among Serbs, Croats, and Muslims 
to find an agreement and a territorial settlement. Until now, 
we have not succeeded. France is the country with the most 
soldiers in Bosnia, the most UN soldiers. It is out of the 
question for us to carry on delivering humanitarian aid if the 
fighting is to continue for another five, 10, or 15 years. The 
presence of our soldiers would become totally meaningless. We 
therefore had to spell out to our partners that we had a duty to 
make one last effort for peace, and for the different parties in 
conflict to come to some agreement. For 10 months -- I found 
this file in the state that it was in, and I am not making any 
judgement on that -- for 10 months, we have been making efforts 
to get the international community interested in this affair. 
At the Copenhagen summit, everyone said they would send extra 
troops, and only France did so, and a month later I wrote to all 
our partners to ask them what they were up to; and let's not 
talk about the setting up of safe havens. 
  Now, we have succeeded in mobilizing the international 
community to ask the belligerents -- I think this is the right 
term to describe them -- first of all to withdraw their heavy 
weapons, and, second, to reach a definitive territorial 
settlement so that we can finish with this war once and for all. 
The European Community, and in particular the North Atlantic 
alliance accepted -- following the proposals put forward by 
France and the United States.... 
  [de Virieu, interrupting] By France in particular. 
  [Balladur] By France in particular at the beginning, but the 
United States rallied to our proposals. We have a deadline of 
seven days ahead of us for all the heavy weaponry to be 
withdrawn or grouped together. When this deadline expires, we 
shall see what the situation is.... 
  [de Virieu, interrupting] We -- in other words who? 
  [Balladur] We, the members of the Atlantic Alliance.... 
  [de Virieu, interrupting] And the United Nations. 
  [Balladur] And the United Nations, and the countries that 
are 
most present on the ground in Bosnia, which, I think, have more 
to say on the subject than others -- which means France, above 
all. If, as I hope, and I cannot envisage the opposite, the 
warring parties return to the negotiating table, agree to talk, 
withdraw their arms as we have demanded, then there is a hope. 
If they do not, then it goes without saying that what was 
threatened will have to be carried out. 
  [de Virieu] This means that the ultimatum will not be 
extended by a single day? 
  [Balladur] It will not be extended by a single day, but I 
will be particularly attentive, as I have been for the last 10 
months -- together with Defense Minister Francois Leotard -- I 
will be particularly attentive to the position of our soldiers, 
who are carrying out a humanitarian mission, certainly, but one 
which is nevertheless extremely dangerous. We must take every 
precaution to face every possible outcome.... 
  [de Virieu, interrupting] Does this mean that we would 
withdraw our troops if there were to be air strikes? 
  [Balladur] I am not saying that. We must take all necessary 
measures for their safety. This is the reason why Francois 
Leotard went to Sarajevo on Friday. 
  [de Virieu] Prime Minister, will we be the only ones to 
leave our nationals, our diplomatic mission in particular, in 
the former Yugoslavia? I see that the Americans, the Germans, 
the Dutch are studying evacuation measures. What about us? 
  [Balladur] We will probably not be the only ones to stay. 
[passage omitted] 
  [de Virieu] Last month France agreed to a 50 percent 
devaluation of the CFA franc, that is the currency used in 14 
former French colonies in Africa. The decision had been 
requested by the World Bank for a long time. Isn't it a heavy 
responsibility to accept this devaluation which will make things 
worse in Africa? Was it necessary to make such a large 
devaluation? 
  [Balladur] No, Mr. de Virieu, this will not make things 
worse 
in Africa. Things had got worse in the last ten years or so 
precisely because the CFA franc was overvalued and this had 
prevented investment. This decision was taken by African 
countries, but naturally, let us not be hypocritical, at 
France's instigation, let us be clear, because it seemed to us 
to be the best solution to help the development of these 
countries. 
  [de Virieu] It will enable them to export more cheaply. 
  [Balladur] It will enable them to export more. 
  [de Virieu] Indeed, but they export very little. 
  [Balladur] No, some of them export.... 
  [de Virieu, interrupting] they are importing much more than 
they are exporting. So their imports will be more expensive. 
  [Balladur] Imports will be more expensive, but for many of 
them exporting oil, raw materials or food products this should 
normally bring in additional resources, especially for farmers. 
  [de Virieu] Is this failure of African economies you are 
describing also the failure of France's African policy? 
  [Balladur] I do not believe so, I do not believe so at all. 
One thing is perfectly clear, France has not only interests in, 
but also a moral obligation towards African countries. It 
colonized them, it brought them a great deal, particularly in 
the infrastructure and training spheres. Thirty years of 
decolonization have gone by, the first 20 went smoothly, the 
last 10 less so since the world's economy changed and since the 
infrastructure of these countries was no longer adapted to the 
changes in the world economy. France will increase its aid to 
African countries, it managed to obtain a ten-fold increase in 
their aid to Africa from the IMF and World Bank. This is 
confirmation that there is no question of abandoning Africa, on 
the contrary, it will help it return to the path of progress. 
  [de Virieu] Jean-Marie Colombani. 
  [Colombani] Good evening Prime Minister. 
  [Balladur] Good evening. 
  [de Virieu] Before getting into purely internal issues I 
would simply like to make two short incursions into the news. 
You will soon visit China, it is the last large communist 
country, it is a country which requires exit visas from foreign 
nationals.... 
  [Balladur, interrupting] I hope I will get one. 
  [de Virieu] I hope so too. Does France need to follow in the 
steps of the last remaining large communist country? Are we not 
becoming a very restrictive country in that respect and this in 
the name of the fight against illegal immigration? Are we not 
going too far? 
  [Balladur] We are combating terrorism, not illegal 
immigration. We should bear something in mind, when we say that 
we should control the arrival of foreigners in France and combat 
illegal immigration we are not morally [word indistinct], in any 
case, some are telling us that. But when we are saying that 
someone should not leave -- not without authorization -- without 
having previously told us so that we know where he is going and 
that we know for sure that he really left, we are also being 
told that this is improper. You know, let us bear in mind what 
we are doing, we are living in a world where terrorism is 
spreading in an extraordinary manner and we are close to 
countries which are often terrorist in habits and interests and 
it is perfectly normal -- and I fully support the interior 
minister, Mr. Pasqua, for having so decided -- it is quite 
normal we should take all the necessary steps to combat 
terrorism. As far as the comparison on this issue with communist 
China is concerned I repeat that a visa is one thing and to 
inform is another one. 
  [Colombani] Concerning this issue again, exit visas are also 
required from Palestinians, this news is made public when Alain 
Juppe is visiting Israel and when visa are no more required from 
Israeli nationals. Is this a trademark of a balanced policy 
towards this region of the world where the two parties are 
making peace? 
  [Balladur] Listen, I believe that this problem concerning 
Palestinians will be solved very quickly because for them, like 
for nationals of other countries, the issue is -- I repeat this 
-- not to prevent them leaving but to ask them to let us know 
when they are leaving. I believe that Mr. Juppe himself said in 
Israel that he found both issues perfectly compatible. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Colombani] You are operating within the framework of 
cohabitation. Is this second cohabitation closer to your ideal 
model than was the first one? 
  [Balladur] Mr. Colombani, cohabitation is hardly an ideal 
model. It is a situation born of two contradictory elections, 
presidential and parliamentary. From that moment, the leaders 
have a duty to ensure that the country does not suffer from 
their coexistence. How can you imagine, especially when we have 
6,000 soldiers in Bosnia, who are in a dangerous situation, 
imagine if we were to squabble at the head of the state. It 
would be quite unacceptable. In these circumstances, as far as 
I am concerned, I am doing everything to ensure that things work 
out as well as possible. The French people have chosen new 
policies. I have the mandate to carry them out, the 
Constitution gives the government the means to implement them; I 
am using these means, while respecting the prerogatives of the 
president, and everything is perfectly simple and clear. 
  [Colombani] Very well, but that is your side of the story. 
When the president calls you to draw up a new social contract, 
or when he warns you of deep-seated revolt, do you think that he 
is overstepping his role, or do you expect this kind of 
behavior? Does it annoy you, does it lead to tension, or is it 
just the day-to-day routine of cohabitation? 
  [Balladur] I think that there is no need to exaggerate the 
significance of this. There is no secret: Mr. Mitterrand is a 
socialist, and I am not -- he said so himself. In these 
circumstances, our views of a certain number of problems are not 
the same. We are nevertheless both committed to serving our 
country as best we can, especially in international and military 
affairs, as is the case at present. I express my point of view, 
I carry out the policies which the French people have chosen. 
The government has the support of a large majority in the 
assembly. I cannot expect everyone to shut up. I have nothing 
to add on this subject. [passage omitted] 
  [Colombani] Let's talk about the presidential elections. 
You imposed a law of silence on your ministers, you requested 
silence from your party. Does this mean that on 2 January 1995, 
let's say, everyone will be freed from this constraint? 
  [Balladur] [passage omitted] The French people are not on 
the 
edge of their seats waiting to see who will be the next 
president. Let me assure you that the question does not haunt 
their sleep and their every thought.... 
  [Colombani, interrupting] It depends who you're talking 
about. 
  [Balladur] But I wasn't talking about you. [passage omitted] 
  [de Virieu] Can we return to the draft bill on military 
programs, because I said just now that Jean-Marie Colombani 
would be speaking to you about it, and evidently the subject 
does not inspire him; so, anyway, the day after tomorrow there 
is a cabinet meeting on defense, which is going to examine -- 
from what I have read in LE MONDE, which is a good 
paper....[pauses] In any case you are going to be examining the 
white paper, it does not matter so much when. This white paper 
has been drafted to examine the new military threat in the world 
and its conclusions are going to be used by Mr. Leotard to draft 
a military programs bill. I saw that there is some question of 
France changing its military doctrine to agree to be more fully 
involved in NATO where its peacekeeping operations are 
concerned. Is this true or not? 
  [Balladur] No, this is not what it is about, not at all. In 
the white paper which Francois Leotard is preparing, and in the 
military programs bill, it is anticipated that in specific 
cases, and by the decision each time of the president and the 
prime minister, the defense minister and the chief of staff of 
the Armed Forces may take part in this or that meeting, but in 
response to the needs of the situation each time and not 
automatically, or as a general rule. That is the first point. 
  The second point: As for knowing whether or not France will 
take part in operations within the framework of NATO, it has 
already done so, to a certain extent -- during the Gulf war. 
That was not within the framework of NATO, but by using NATO's 
means -- we are playing on words a little here. Moreover, the 
French-German corps, which, it is anticipated, may....[pauses] 
which is at the disposal of the Western European Union, but may 
also be used by NATO, is also a means of making things more 
flexible, but, basically, France's position must remain as it 
was defined in 1966: it is a member of the Alliance.... 
  [de Virieu, interrupting] By General de Gaulle. 
  [Balladur] By General de Gaulle, and maintained by his 
successors, his three successors. France is a member of the 
alliance, it takes part in a certain number of activities within 
this alliance, but it is not integrated into the alliance's 
command, and we must be very careful to preserve our autonomy, 
even our independence in this matter, and furthermore we have 
been able to see in the Bosnia affair precisely how much the 
fact that we are autonomous gives us greater weight in the eyes 
of others. 
  [de Virieu] Thank you, Prime Minister. That was "The Hour of 
Truth" with Mr. Edouard Balladur. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Giorgio Bocca article: "Anticommunism Without Communists"] </F>
  [Text] Two temptations attributable to the fear of the new 
have become widespread in this confused election campaign -- 
anticommunism and Berlusconism. 
  Anticommunism without communism creates figments of the 
imagination which are completely without foundation but for that 
very reason irresistible. The RAI [state radio and television 
service] is dominated by the communists! How? Where? It is 
better not to ask, because it will make you look like either a 
communist or a gullible idiot. 
  No matter that the RAI's director is Gianni Locatelli, a 
Catholic, surrounded by professorial figures reminiscent of 
Bocconi or originating from Giuseppe de Rita's ultra-Catholic 
CENSIS [Social Investments Studies Center]. 
  No matter that two out of three television networks do not 
belong to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] area and that 
when it comes to radio, the Catholic, Aldo Grasso, is in charge 
of cultural programs and the liberal-socialist, Livio Zanetti, 
head of news. Never mind that: The RAI is dominated by 
communists. The proof? The RAI does not like [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi, who is leading a crusade against communism; 
"therefore" it is communist itself. "Is it not that the RAI is 
justifiably afraid that if Berlusconi is victorious he could 
gobble it up?" "Don't talk nonsense. It is communist." 
  The judiciary too are communists. This was said yesterday, 
to deafening applause, by red Titti [Judge Tiziana Parenti] -- 
apart from her hair, a few years ago she was also red by 
political affiliation. None of the magistrates involved in the 
corruption investigations -- Di Pietro, Colombo, Davigo, 
D'Ambrosio -- has ever been a communist party member, but if 
Titti Parenti says so, they definitely are communists. "But are 
they not trying almost obsessively to make Sama confess that 
Gardini paid the communists a billion lire?" "Yes, but it is 
all a sham." 
  The universities are communists, and so are the major 
newspapers. "But are their bosses not members of the haute 
bourgeoisie, major businessmen?" "Yes, but of the kind that 
flirt with communism in order to jointly trample honest 
anticommunist businessmen." 
  Anticommunism without communism is spreading like wildfire 
because it conceals a fear of the new -- which is indeed real, a 
constant factor in Italy's tradition of quick-change acts, in a 
country where, from Garibaldi to Mussolini, all destroyers of 
the old state resigned and promptly began to rebuild it. Not 
that we have confidence in the transformation of the progressive 
alliance; what has happened in France and Spain prompts caution, 
but be that as it may, a left-wing government must surely change 
a few details, must surely try to eliminate some bad habits, 
must surely correct some inefficiencies and instances of wastage 
-- enough to terrify the moderates who, if the ruling parties 
had not died of their own account, through a process of emptying 
and paralysis, would want them back again. 
  Berlusconism is the other side of the fear of the new; it is 
the old in a superficially new guise, and the moderates seek 
nothing more than superficial change. The League and the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] could not succeed on their own. For 
90 percent of Italians, the League is something alien and 
dangerous, parochial and secessionist. It may be only a paper 
tiger, but you never know what things will lead to -- look at 
what happened in Yugoslavia. Gianfranco Fini's MSI is less 
worrying, but still disreputable. The right man is Silvio 
Berlusconi, who represents the Italian people's two great loves 
-- soccer and television, the self-made man, from pauper to 
millionaire, but always easy to get along with. Who better than 
him could painlessly carry out the great and painless changeover 
of Italian politicians? Out with the old faces of the criminals 
and corrupt, and in with the unknown faces that are by that 
token new. 
  Silvio Berlusconi is said to have told journalists who asked 
him about his program: "I will not tell you; otherwise the 
others will copy it." Such a reply would sound ridiculous in a 
country that really wants to change, but it is a stroke of 
genius in a country that has no desire to change. A great and 
painless changeover of the political class: This is what the 
moderates expect from Berlusconi. The greedy service-sector 
bourgeoisie, with their carnation [Italian Socialist Party 
symbol] buttonholes, that used to applaud Bettino Craxi have 
been replaced by a second generation who applaud Berlusconi in 
the expectation of being able to further their careers and their 
own interests. 
  If the system of party rule was somehow similar to fascism, 
we must unfortunately admit that it collapsed without any 
anti-Fascists. At the Rome conference of Forza Italia, 
representing the same old Italy motivated by the principle of 
just getting along somehow, the audience applauded loudly -- and 
I would say with relief -- the vague hymns to economic 
liberalism, deregulation, and to God, country, family, and 
individuals that leave things as they are. 
  Both the moderates' anticommunism without communism and the 
vilification of Berlusconi, described as the "Black Knight" and 
founder of a Fascism clad in a cashmere sweater are both 
imaginary. What the moderates expect from Berlusconi in the 
event of victory is that he will recycle the democracy of the 
First Republic, complete with soccer and television.

Crisis Among Center Democrats"] 
  [Excerpts] The Center Democrats' Bente Juncker, who 
yesterday was forced to give up her dream job after only two 
weeks as social affairs minister, is now being threatened by her 
own colleagues in the Center Democrat Folketing group. 
  Bente Juncker was forced to resign after having circulated 
unproven sexual insinuations about Poul Thofner, the head of the 
Fyrreparken institute for the mentally subnormal in Naestved. 
He is now threatening a court case for defamation. 
  Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic 
Party) 
did not protest at the social affairs minister's resignation: 
"I agree with Bente Juncker's decision," he said. "It was a 
sad day, but let us look forward instead of being too 
depressed." [passage omitted] 
  The new social affairs minister will be former Center 
Democrat Folketing deputy Yvonne Herlov Andersen. She comes 
from a job as head of an institution for the mentally 
handicapped and is the first trained social worker to fill the 
post.

  [Text] AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] 
insists that it would be unreasonable to implement the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] if Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas does not change his position on the substance of 
the Cyprus issue radically. The party formulated its position 
during another Political Bureau meeting today to examine 
developments in the Cyprus issue in light of the upcoming 
proximity talks. 
  AKEL Secretary General Dhimitrios Khristofias told the 
Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation that AKEL is disappointed with the de 
facto situation, as he expressed it, which the president has 
created. He said: We refuse to cover up this situation. 
Khristofias mentioned that if Kliridhis made the decision to 
attend the proximity talks, he will have to figure out how to 
return to the substance of the Cyprus issue. Khristofias added 
that the party will not withdraw from the National Council. 
  Within the framework of the dialogue with other parties that 
began at EDEK's [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] initiative, 
DISI [Democratic Rally] and socialist party EDEK delegations met 
today at the DISI offices to discuss the CBM's. DISI Chairman 
Ioannis Matsis and EDEK Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis headed the 
delegations. 
  After the meeting, Matsis and Lissaridhis made statements. 
Matsis said that every party has its own position on the CBM's 
and considers its approach correct. He added, however, that 
they have a common goal: To break the deadlock and end the 
occupation. Lissaridhis reiterated that his party wants to 
disengage from the CBM's and turn toward the substance of the 
Cyprus issue.

  [Text] Ankara, Feb 14 (A.A) -- Turkey on Monday [14 
February] sent eight more F-16 warplanes in a bid to reinforce 
its warplanes stationed in Italy's Ghedi base where NATO forces 
are preparing for a possible air attack of Serb artillery around 
Sarajevo. 
  Ten Turkish F-16 fighting Falcons are already stationed in 
Italy taking part in NATO enforcement of the "no-fly" zone over 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  As Greece did not allow Turkish fighter planes to fly 
through 
its skies, F-16's took a longer route over the Mediterranean to 
reach Italy. 
  The decision of sending the warplanes was made after a NATO 
ultimatum, for Bosnia's Serbs to put heavy weapons in Sarajevo 
under the United Nations control.

  [Excerpts] Vienna, Feb 15 (AFP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reached agreement here 
Tuesday [15 February] on resuming inspections of Pyongyang's 
nuclear facilities after a year-long standoff, the agency's 
spokesman said. 
  The agreement eased international tensions which had been 
tightened another notch a day earlier by the most unequivocal in 
a series of claims that Pyongyang has an active nuclear weapons 
programme. 
  But the accord makes no provision for inspection of the two 
Yongbyon sites where the suspected nuclear arms facility is 
based. 
  IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the two sides had reached an 
accord on inspecting seven identified sites and that a six- or 
seven-strong IAEA mission of two to three weeks' duration would 
enter North Korea as soon as visa formalities had been dealt 
with. 
  Welcoming the accord, Kyd said that, if all went well, the 
mission could get under way in the next few days, adding that 
Pyongyang had accepted all IAEA demands concerning the nature of 
the inspections. 
  He stressed the agreement did not cover the two undeclared 
sites at Yongbyon, where the IAEA suspected that Pyongyang was 
illegally stockpiling liquid and solid nuclear waste. 
  He said those sites would be the subject of future 
negotiations. 
  The accord comes six days before a meeting of IAEA governors 
at which future relations with North Korea are due to be 
discussed. 
  Kyd added that the aim of the inspections at the seven 
declared sites was to "verify that nuclear material in these 
facilities has not been diverted since earlier inspections." 
  "In addition, inspectors will take certain measures, such as 
reloading of cameras and changing of seals, to facilitate future 
verifications." [passage omitted] 
  Earlier Tuesday in Tokyo, Japan's JIJI Press quoted official 
South Korean sources as saying Pyongyang's absolute leader Kim 
Il-Sung had proposed a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton 
over the nuclear issue. 
  Kim made the proposal through U.S. Southern Baptist 
evangelist Billy Graham, who met the North Korean president and 
party chief when he visited Pyongyang in late January, the 
sources said. 
  Russian researchers told JIJI Monday that the former Soviet 
Union had been engaged in a joint plan with North Korea to build 
a nuclear bomb until 1985, and that Russian scientists continued 
to provide clandestine assistance to Pyongyang.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 15 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation is increasingly critical of apparently 
inadequate United Nations plans to monitor Serb artillery around 
Sarajevo, sources at NATO headquarters said here Tuesday [15 
February]. 
  They said plans by UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) to have 
monitors check on Serb artillery stored in Serb barracks did not 
amount to proper control. 
  One source, speaking on condition that he not be identified, 
said: "That's not a proper control. We need to be serious about 
this. The control has to be strong enough to stop the weapons 
being used." [passage omitted] 
  In Zagreb, UNPROFOR spokesman Matthew Nerzig denied reports 
of differences "between the goals pursued by NATO and the UN." 
He maintained Tuesday that the UN wanted "effective control" of 
the weapons and not mere monitoring. 
  But Nerzig would not give details of the UN plans, and 
conceded that UNPROFOR officials were giving a "broad 
interpretation" to the concept of control. 
  The UNPROFOR spokesman said the NATO ultimatum issued last 
week called specifically for "the withdrawal or regrouping and 
placing the heavy weapons under UNPROFOR control. Under 
UNPROFOR control means just that: this is not a monitoring of 
heavy weapons, this is the effective control of those heavy 
weapons," he said. 
  Nerzig quoted a recent statement by the British commander of 
UNPROFOR in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, who said there 
were many ways of effectively controlling the Serb weapons. 
"Those are the ways that are being looked into and being 
discussed with the (Serb and Moslem belligerents)," he said. 
  Nerzig added: "I wouldn't spell out exactly which procedure 
or process we are going to use in the variety of cases. We are 
working on setting an effective control."

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Muslim Premier Haris Silajdzic by </F>
Bob Kroon in Geneva; date not given: "Silajdzic Counts on 
American-Russian Cooperation"; first two paragraphs are GAZET 
VAN ANTWERPEN introduction] 
  [Text] Although the talks in Geneva have stalled, the 
diplomatic activity is more hectic than ever just one week 
before possible actions by NATO. The United States is counting 
on "Russia playing a constructive role," and expects Moscow to 
exert pressure on Serbian President Milosevic. Meanwhile, 
together with Germany and Turkey, the United States will place 
Croatian President Tudjman and Bosnian Leader Izetbegovic under 
pressure. 
  Bosnian Muslim Premier Haris Silajdzic says that he is very 
pleased with Clinton's radical change of tack. "The Serbs could 
always count on the support of the Russians, whereas Washington 
kept out of harm's way," he said, before returning to Sarajevo. 
"Now the balance has finally been restored. Bosnia is not an 
isolated problem. It concerns Europe and the whole world. The 
ultimatum should have been announced last year, then a great 
deal of suffering would have been spared." 
  [Kroon] Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic has said that he will 
only withdraw his heavy weapons if the numerically stronger 
Muslim troops return to their barracks. Was that the agreement? 
  [Silajdzic] Absolutely not. There are more than eight 
million Serbs, several times the number of Bosnian Muslims. 
However, we are much more motivated, because we are fighting 
for our homeland. Karadzic is bluffing. I do not think that he 
wants NATO on his back. 
  [Kroon] Karadzic says that air strikes would mean the end of 
NATO, and he cannot guarantee the protection of international 
aid workers in the chaos that might result from them. 
  [Silajdzic] That is laughable. And as for the aid convoys, 
the Serbs are protecting them so well that most of them never 
even reach their destination. 
  [Kroon] You feel strengthened by U.S. support. Does that 
mean that you will no longer be satisfied with a tripartite 
division, according to which the Muslims are allocated 33 
percent of Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] We are still proceeding on the basis of a 
three-way split. However, the issue is not whether we get 33 or 
33.3 percent. We want habitable areas in both eastern and 
western Bosnia, areas to which the refugees can return. 
  [Kroon] Do you see any possibilities of forming a coalition 
with the Croats, now that Nationalist Leader Boban has been 
shunted onto the sidelines? 
  [Silajdzic] That would be an extremely logical development. 
The new delegation leader Akmadzic seems willing to cooperate. 
A coalition between the Muslims and Croats would solve a number 
of problems, both for us and for them. However, Akmadzic is 
still demanding Mostar as the capital of Croatian territory in 
Bosnia, and we cannot accept this. The majority of the 
population of Mostar is Muslim, it is not a Croatian city. 
Furthermore, it was they who barbarously reduced Mostar -- one 
of the most beautiful cities in Europe -- to rubble. Mostar 
belongs to all sectors of the population. 
  [Kroon] What is your view of the new developments? 
  [Silajdzic] I hope that the Russians actually cooperate with 
the United States. If they do, then the problem can be resolved 
within several months. However, President Yeltsin is facing 
difficulties. Many Russian generals regard people like Karadzic 
and General Mladic as some kind of brothers-in-arms. Moreover, 
we should not underestimate the problem posed by someone like 
Zhirinovskiy, as happened way back in the case of derided artist 
Adolf Hitler. However, it is not Zhirinovskiy himself, but 
rather what he embodies that is the issue -- the frustrations 
and apparent hopelessness of the situation in Russia. That 
neofascist Milosevic in Belgrade remains one of the main guilty 
parties. If the Russians can bring him into line, then we will 
have come a whole step further.

<F P=106> [Article signed PL/KV: "Van Miert Guards Against Crisis </F>
Cartels: `European Steel Plan Has Failed'"] 
  [Text] "It is becoming increasingly clear that the European 
steel plan has as good as failed," said European Commissioner 
Karel Van Miert in an interview with DE FINANCIEEL-EKONOMISCHE 
TIJD. And yet, the Commission of the European Union (EU) does 
not want to listen to the call for a crisis cartel in either the 
steel sector or in other industrial sectors that are 
experiencing difficulties. 
  On 15 February, the European Commission will hold talks with 
Eurofer [European Steelmakers Association] on a further 
reduction of the production capacity in private steel companies. 
EU Commissioner Karel Van Miert, who is responsible for 
competition policy, is extremely pessimistic. "We will never 
reach the proposed objective of attaining a reduction of 30 
million tonnes in the output of raw steel and of 20 million 
tonnes in rolled steel." 
  The steel industry is currently enjoying a slight upswing. 
Moreover, it is using the ponderous decisionmaking within the EU 
on subsidies for the public sector steel industry as a pretext 
for leaving everything as it was before. A number of companies 
are requesting that the EU Commission itself intervene in the 
mechanism of the market by declaring a crisis situation, as 
happened in the 1980's. However, Van Miert does not want to 
hear of any such proposal. 
  Meanwhile, the Germans are pushing for the establishment of 
crisis cartels. Here, too, Van Miert has pitifully little 
understanding for this idea. "We had a good steel plan. We are 
not going to replace it with a bad one," he said. However, 
mergers between steel companies will be allowed, provided they 
do not give the companies concerned a leading position on the 
market for specific products. 
  If the sector fails to table any plans for further 
reductions 
next week, the European Commission will have to review its 
policy, said Van Miert. For instance, imports from East Europe 
would no longer be slowed down, and individual consultations on 
the prices of products would be stopped. 
<H5>  Zinc </H5>
  The call for crisis cartels has never been so clamorous 
before, said Van Miert. Various sectors which are currently 
experiencing difficulties -- such as the paper industry and the 
chemical sector -- are knocking on the door in Brussels. The 
zinc sector will also shortly present its agreements for a 
10-percent reduction in production. 
  "As a matter of principle I am extremely reluctant when it 
comes to cartel agreements of this kind," said EU Commissioner 
Van Miert. As far as possible, Brussels is refusing to commit 
itself, unless the crisis in the sector is all too clearly the 
result of external factors. However, the European Commission 
did tolerate similar agreements between European aluminum 
producers, for the crisis in that sector had been caused by 
massive Russian exports.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 16 (AFP) -- The European Commission 
hit 16 EC steel firms on Wednesday [16 February] with fines 
totaling ECU104 million (115 million dollars) for operating an 
illegal cartel, Competitions Commissioner Karel Van Miert said. 
  They were accused of having fixed prices and shared the 
market for heavy steel sections and beams used in the 
construction industry. 
  All of the big EC steel groups making such products were 
fined, including Luxembourg's Arbed company, British Steel, 
Preussag in Germany, and a subsidiary of French group 
Usinor-Sacilor. 
  The European Commission found that the companies had acted 
as 
a cartel since the mid-1980's, regularly exchanging information 
as well as having understandings on prices and market shares.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 16 (AFP) -- The European Commission 
fined 16 European steelmakers a record ECU104 million (115 
million dollars) here Wednesday [16 February] for running a 
steel beams cartel, with British Steel taking the brunt of the 
fines. 
  Announcing the decision, European Community Competitions 
Commissioner Karel van Miert said the largest fine -- ECU32 
million (35.2 million dollars) -- was imposed on British Steel 
-- nearly one third of the total. 
  Van Miert rejected allegations that the fines had anything 
to 
do with attempts by the EC executive to force private 
steelmakers into large steel production cuts in order to restore 
the ailing industry to profitability. 
  He said the steelmakers had operated a price-fixing and 
market-sharing cartel in clear infringment of EC competition 
rules since 1984, but that they had been fined for their 
activities only since July 1988. 
  Luxembourg steelmaker Arbed SA was fined ECU11.2 million 
(12.3 million dollars), the German firm Preussag AG ECU12.4 
million (13.7 million dollars), and the Unimetal affiliate of 
Usinor-Sacilor of France ECU12.3 million (13.5 million dollars). 
  Van Miert said British Steel received the biggest fine 
because it was the largest producer of steel beams used in the 
construction industry, and had played a leading part in the 
cartel.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 16 (AFP) -- Private European 
Community steelmakers still need to find capacity cuts of two to 
four million tonnes of hot-rolled steel if a rescue plan for the 
industry is to succeed, an EC official said Wednesday [16 
February]. 
  EC Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann told journalists 
here that the private steel sector had been given until April to 
share out amongst themselves the required capacity cuts. 
  He said the two to four million capacity reduction target 
was 
the bare minimum to destroy over-production of between 19 and 25 
million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a year. 
  Bangemann was speaking after a meeting with steel executives 
here on Tuesday to discuss the over-production crisis. 
  "I think they got the message," he said, adding that he 
planned another meeting with the steelmen shortly before a 
gathering of EC industry ministers on April 22 to review the 
rescue plan. 
  He repeated that the European Commission would abandon a 
plan 
to lend financial support for a slimming down of the steel 
industry unless the private sector accepted the Commission's 
capacity-cut targets. 
  But Bangemann said the threat had nothing to do with the 
Commission's decision Wednesday to levy fines totalling ECU104 
million (115 million dollars) on 16 European steel firms for 
running a cartel in steel beams. 
  About one third of the total fine was levied on British 
Steel, and the fines provoked outrage in Britain. 
  Reflecting British sentiment, Keith Brookman, general 
secretary of Britain's Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, 
suggested earlier that the fines might be a "blackmail tactic" 
to enforce the production cuts. 
  The Commission's capacity reduction targets would mean 
scrapping at least 60,000 jobs -- a sacrifice deemed essential 
medicine for an industry buffetted by a steel glut, falling 
demand, plummetting prices and economic recession. 
  Last December, EC governments agreed that the public sector 
steelworks would cut production by 5.5 million tonnes of 
hot-rolled steel a year, as a condition for allowing them 
last-time subsidies totalling about 7.5 billion dollars. 
  Bangemann said there were indications that the private 
sector 
might be ready to slice capacity by about 11 million tonnes, 
leaving two to four million tonnes still to be found. 
  But the private steelmakers are upset about continuing 
subsidies paid to their public sector competition in Spain, 
Germany, Italy and Portugal. 
  They say they are being asked to shoulder an unfairly large 
share of the production sacrifice in the face of 
state-subsidised competition.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Spain said here Monday 
[14 February] that it did not want future members of the 
European Community to influence a decision over whether or not 
to go ahead with an early currency union and an EC single 
currency. 
  Spanish Finance Minister Pedro Solbes told journalists after 
a meeting of EC finance ministers that Sweden, Finland, Norway 
and Austria should not be allowed to vote for a possible 
currency union between 1997 and 1999. 
  The four countries are negotiating to enter the EC by 
January 
1, 1995, two years ahead of the earliest possible date for 
currency union. But Solbes said he wanted the single currency 
decision limited to the EC's 12 current members. [passage 
omitted] 
  Spain is worried that the EC newcomers, being relatively 
wealthy, would fulfill the currency union membership criteria 
and produce a majority to go ahead with the single currency, 
leaving other members like Spain behind. 
  It has also complained that the newcomers would raise the EC 
economic averages of inflation and interest rates, making it 
more difficult for the poorer countries such as Spain to qualify 
for economic union. 
  But the chairman of Monday's meeting, Yannos Papantoniou of 
Greece, said the Spanish position had no general support. 
German Finance Secretary Johan Eekhoff said there was nothing 
in the Maastricht Treaty to support it. 
  The meeting expressed general support for an EC plan to 
fight 
unemployment by launching a massive ECU120 billion (132 billion 
dollar) infrastructure investment scheme, and by deregulating 
the labour market. 
  Several ministers, particularly Philippe Maystadt of Belgium 
and Marianne Jelved of Denmark, stressed the need for greater 
monetary cooperation to prepare the ground for a single currency.

<F P=106> [Interview with Greek European Affairs Minister Theodore </F>
Pangalos by Isabelle Graviere; place and date not given: 
"Theodore Pangalos: `East-Bound High-Speed Train Is Well 
Placed Among Major Projects To Be Announced in June'" -- first 
paragraph is LES ECHOS introduction] 
  [Text] The Greek minister for European affairs, president 
for six months for European Council meetings until the Corfu 
summit in June, is making the major infrastructure projects of 
the Delors white paper and the enlargement of the Community his 
two main priorities. However, he would also like to see the 
list of criteria needed for passing into the third stage of 
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) completed and its timetable of 
application reviewed. Finally he pleads for a peaceful solution 
to be found in the former Yugoslavia, for an accelerated peace 
process in the Middle East, and for increased cooperation with 
South Africa. 
  [Graviere] You are faced with a Europe in crisis. What will 
be the Greek presidency's priorities for meeting this challenge? 
  [Pangalos] Our priority is obviously the White Paper on 
Growth, Competition, and Employment adopted in December by the 
European Council in Brussels. The peoples of Europe are 
primarily concerned with unemployment. However, it is only if 
we can convince them that we are doing something about the 
economy and unemployment that we will persuade them that a 
united Europe is a good thing. Our aim is that the major 
projects outlined in this document should start to contribute to 
the recovery of the European economy from the start of next 
year. A set of specified projects must be decided on in June at 
the Corfu meeting of the European Council. 
  We have set in place a working timetable. The so-called 
Christophersen group which will work on the transport networks 
has already met once. The so-called Bangeman group on 
telecommunications is to start work next week. The white paper 
is on the agenda at all our Council meetings. 
  [Graviere] What are the projects you want to see completed? 
The TGV-East [high-speed train]? 
  [Pangalos] We will have to examine the costs and the 
financial resources available. It seems to me that the TGV-East 
is well placed. However, we will have to make other decisions. 
  [Graviere] What is the second priority, after the white 
paper? 
  [Pangalos] Expansion. Four candidate countries could become 
members in 1995. We will push for their fate to be decided at 
the end of our six-month term of presidency. This would let 
them attend the Corfu summit, at least as associate members. We 
have a deadline for the end of negotiations -- 1 March. I have 
scheduled an extraordinary Council meeting for 21 and 22 
February plus a jumbo Council session on 25 to 28 February. 
Moreover, the question must be asked if we will succeed with 
all of them, or just some of them. It is a difficult challenge, 
but it is not impossible. We need the cooperation of the member 
states (it is important that no country raises new problems as 
some may be tempted to do). Also, the candidate countries must 
accept all Community accession negotiations, including the 
agricultural provisions. The Community cannot have a system 
where prices differ from one country to the next -- that would 
be stepping back 10 years. On the contrary, the candidate 
countries can increase their support for their farmers, for 
example by taxing those citizens who would benefit considerably 
from a sharp drop in farm prices caused by the introduction of 
the CAP [common agricultural policy] in these countries. 
  [Graviere] Are starting the second phase of the EMU and 
improving convergence of Community economies also challenges 
that the Greek presidency hopes to meet? 
  [Pangalos] Most countries currently do not conform to the 
Maastricht criteria. Not only are we not converging at the 
European level, we are increasingly diverging, as is shown in 
the worsening German budget deficit. We have to revise, if not 
these criteria then at least the timetable for passing to the 
third stage of EMU. This is all the more true since it is almost 
impossible to reconcile a policy of budget constraint that we 
would need to reach these criteria with the current economic 
situation. Therefore we are asking for the introduction of 
supplementary criteria that cater more to the real economic 
situation and, in particular, criteria relative to the increase 
in national income, the rate of investment, and employment. The 
monetarist approach has shown its limitations, and this is 
proved by the crisis of the last few years. 
  [Graviere] You also have to manage the crisis in Yugoslavia 
and the evolution of the peace process in the Middle East. What 
are you doing? 
  [Pangalos] Where Yugoslavia is concerned, we have a peace 
plan and we still think it is the only valid one. In Greece, 
even if we did not want to veto the decision made by NATO last 
week concerning a possible intervention, we think it is 
dangerous to exercise military force in this region. 
  In the Middle East, we have promised $600 million. However, 
before we "sign the check" there must be an agreement, and it 
must be clear who the authority is who will be controlling the 
occupied territories. We are also busy in South Africa. We 
have set up an office with regard to the elections and to 
prepare our future cooperation with the new government. 
  [Graviere] Finally, what do you want to achieve to call the 
Greek presidency a success at the June Corfu summit? 
  [Pangalos] If we arrive at a sufficiently precise program 
outlining measures to implement the proposals of the white 
paper, if the Community is enlarged even partially, and if a 
peaceful solution is found to the problems in Yugoslavia, then 
the Greek term of office will have been a good presidency...and 
I will be a happy man.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F>
by Edoardo Gardumi in Brussels; date not given: "Europe Is 
Adrift"] 
  [Text] It is not only the process of European integration 
that has reached a crossroads: The continent's longest-standing 
and stablest democracies have reached one too, maintains 
Commission President Jacques Delors, who talks of a "weariness" 
among the great nations that have played a major role in world 
history. Unless they manage to broaden participation, making 
democracy work better, the "bad shepherds," the prophets of hate 
and discord, will arrive on the scene. A fundamental test, says 
Delors, is the fight against mass unemployment, which is not a 
temporary issue but a structural phenomenon. 
  In all probability, Jacques Delors will retire before the 
end 
of the year. He has been presiding over the European Commission 
in Brussels since 1985, witnessing the parabola of these last 
few years from the front line: The mighty thrust toward 
political integration has gradually lost momentum, leaving 
behind it the depressing stagnation of recent times. Delors 
remains a passionate advocate of the unification of Europe, but 
he now seems to be conducting a lone crusade. A militant 
socialist with a solid Catholic background, he now has a serried 
rank of conservative heads of government to deal with, although 
this does not seem to have done much to dampen his proverbial 
fighting spirit. 
  [Gardumi] Mr. President, the proposals you made in your 
white 
paper on employment and investment in Europe have been received 
with great interest in Italy, particularly on the left. 
However, the governments of the Twelve have not shown the same 
amount of enthusiasm. Do you not think that European policies 
for lowering unemployment are still way below needs and 
expectations? 
  [Delors] We must draw a distinction between the white paper 
and the decisions of the European Council in Brussels. The 
white paper is intended as an analysis of what I would call the 
"European sickness," by which I mean the inability of our 
countries to maintain the competitiveness required to create the 
millions of jobs we need. I had already warned the heads of 
government that we were facing structural problems some time 
ago, although I also added a note of optimism: Europe has the 
capacity to solve these problems. The white paper takes up this 
analysis, this diagnosis, and puts forward recommendations as to 
what can be done at both the Community and the national levels. 
The European Council has approved it in general terms, but as 
the problems are of a structural nature, we cannot solve them 
overnight. I realize that public opinion is anxious about the 
future in view of the rising tide of unemployment and all the 
social problems that it brings with it, such as deprivation and 
instability, and wants us to move faster. The situation can be 
changed, but it will take time and a lot of thought. The white 
paper has opened a window on the medium-term future and has 
shown that we are not condemned to a decline. It is a plan of 
action and a framework for thought and discussion. 
  [Gardumi] You propose high investment in major 
continent-wide 
infrastructure networks, but the resources are not easy to find. 
  [Delors] It must first be said that these projects do not 
set 
out to achieve immediate economic recovery, but to strengthen 
the economy, thus making it more competitive and capable of 
creating employment. The plans cover the transportation, power, 
and information networks serving us all. Some critics accuse 
them of being an incitement to borrowing, but the venerable 
theory of public finance states that if a government decides on 
projects that will benefit three generations, those three 
generations must all contribute to financing them. In any case, 
it must also be realized that investment often makes for extra 
savings. These criticisms are unfounded. Moreover, there are 
various ways in which private capital can be brought in to 
supplement public funding. Suffice it to mention what was 
achieved in the capitalist country par excellence, the United 
States, under President Roosevelt. It is only the right-wing 
ideologists who oppose this idea. Do we intend to sit with our 
feet up while threatened by this tide of unemployment? 
  [Gardumi] The Maastricht Treaty refers to a single currency 
and joint foreign and security policies. However, never before 
have there been such great divergences between currencies and 
national interests. Do you think the goals of the treaty can 
still be achieved? 
  [Delors] Here again, we must distinguish between the two 
aspects of the treaty. As far as economic and monetary union is 
concerned, we got off to a good start. Until September 1992, 
the convergence between the various economies was increasing, 
and the currencies were stable within the EMS [European Monetary 
System]. However, these appearances concealed divergences in the 
development of some of the economic systems, hence the events of 
the September in question. To all intents and purposes, we now 
have to start again from scratch. The fact remains that it is 
in every country's interest to have a stable currency, low 
inflation, and a public borrowing requirement kept within 
reasonable limits. I therefore think that the road to economic 
convergence can be found, and if it is the deadlines adopted can 
be met. It must also be borne in mind that the advocates of 
European integration and those pushing in the opposite direction 
are engaged in a dramatic race against time. We must be 
constantly on the alert. 
  [Gardumi] What about the common initiative at the 
international level? 
  [Delors] I shall be more cautious, more circumspect here, 
firstly because the decisionmaking processes in this sphere are 
highly complicated, and then because, notwithstanding two 
decades of informal cooperation on foreign policy, our countries 
still tend very much to go it alone. We must put a great amount 
of joint thought into understanding the proper function of the 
European Union and its responsibilities, into grasping the real 
hazards that threaten not only our security but that of our 
neighbors, and into recognizing threats to peace and freedom. 
To some extent, this is what the European Commission does, 
within its sphere of jurisdiction, not so much by its own virtue 
but because its job is to identify and grasp the common 
interest. This is what is lacking in the foreign policy field. 
  [Gardumi] Are you not alarmed by this urge, which seems to 
be 
spreading more and more, to seek individual national and 
regional identities? How can a concept of supranational 
integration be defended in these conditions? 
  [Delors] The problem is that Europe is on the move, but 
without a precise idea of where it wants to go. In a few years, 
it could be like a ship adrift at sea, with its rising 
generations completely alienated. This is why we must never 
cease strengthening political will, seizing on common interests, 
explaining everything to the public, acknowledging our 
responsibility before the European Parliament, and involving the 
national parliaments. The question facing us is: where do you 
really want to go? We have to answer it. If this question had 
eluded us, I should be very worried as to the fate of the Europe 
that we are building. Making our intentions clear is a risk, 
but it is one that we have to run. Our democracies are "weary 
of life," and our contemporaries are seeking a feeling of 
belonging to something. If the answer does not come from us, 
the "bad shepherd" will arrive on the scene. 
  [Gardumi] And what might the bad shepherd promise? 
  [Delors] He advocates refusal and rejection of the other, 
the 
exaltation of a race or a religion. There is only one means of 
warding off this danger: an active society and a transparent, 
more effective democracy. Whatever form of words may have been 
used, the ultimate goal of all men of progress has always been 
to deepen the roots of democracy. They have been convinced that 
society and mankind can be improved a little. If we no longer 
believe in this, we can hardly be surprised if the boat is 
adrift. 
  [Gardumi] The war in Bosnia is perhaps the most painful 
wound 
in Europe. Do you think that the time has now come to risk 
greater military involvement in the area? 
  [Delors] I said 18 months ago that without a credible 
military threat it would be impossible to halt the progress of 
this ideology of death that goes by the name of ethnic 
cleansing. I was right, unfortunately. I would have preferred 
to be wrong. The situation has changed now. We must ask 
ourselves whether even a highly unsatisfactory peace would not 
be preferable to the continuation of a war involving weapons of 
mass destruction. The Serbs and Croats in particular have not 
yet fielded all their military resources. I would like to say 
to all those in a position to make decisions: Don't just talk -- 
do something. 
  [Gardumi] You are regarded as the architect of the 
Maastricht 
Treaty. With hindsight, would your approach be the same, or is 
there anything you would change? 
  [Delors] Excuse me, but I must correct a historical fact. I 
have been identified as the architect of European recovery, and 
this flatters me, on the strength of the single act, the 1992 
objective, and the financial agreements embodied in what are 
referred to as packages one and two, but I am not the architect 
of Maastricht. An examination of the Commission's proposals for 
the treaty will show that there are great differences between 
them and the final text. It would therefore be better to put the 
question to those who had a real say in the final drafting of 
the agreement, which, quite frankly, is not mine. However, the 
treaty has been adopted and ratified by the national 
parliaments, and in some cases directly by the people, so let us 
implement it as best we can. Nothing would be more dangerous 
than to throw it open to discussion again now. If it were not 
implemented, there would be a vacuum. In 1996, the next date 
for considering the European institutions, its imperfections and 
the lessons that we have learned from them will have to be taken 
into account. 
  [Gardumi] Widening the Community, first to 18 and then to 20 
or more members, will change its nature. How do you picture the 
Community of the 21st century? 
  [Delors] There is a contradiction that we have to overcome, 
or that I at any rate believe we have to overcome. On the one 
hand, in the face of the collapse of totalitarian communism, we 
West Europeans have a historical duty to extend our values of 
peace, pluralism, respect, and mutual cooperation to all the 
European countries and to enable them all to achieve material 
prosperity. On the other hand, I consider that the heritage of 
the Treaty of Rome is still a living force. What is the main 
message of this heritage? The conviction that no West European 
country is still strong enough to keep on playing the historical 
role to which it aspires in view of Europe's contribution to 
world history, hence the urge to constitute a stronger political 
unity among those who desire this role. How can these two 
projects be reconciled? This is the issue that the Commission 
has been laying before the governments of the Twelve for two or 
three years. If no answer is forthcoming, the construction of 
Europe will go haywire. Finding an answer is difficult, I know, 
but then politics is difficult. 
  [Gardumi] What is your opinion of the process of political 
renewal under way in Italy? 
  [Delors] It used to be said of Italy that the state did not 
work but the economy was prosperous. This notion, which was 
shared by many, has not been reflecting reality for five or six 
years. The need to adjust the system had thus become imperative. 
I consider what is happening doubly encouraging. On the 
economic front, Amato and Ciampi have taken measures that go in 
the right direction, and business has shown great adaptability, 
particularly after the devaluation of the lira, so my conclusion 
is that there is a sound economic base. On the political front, 
a new republic is awaited that will have great opportunities for 
redefining the role of the state and the exercise of 
decentralized powers, and for practicing politics in a way that 
will rekindle the interest of the public and encourage it to 
take an active part in public life. Like many observers outside 
Italy, I believe that the worst moment for your country's image 
is over. Of course, there is still a lot to be done, and I 
repeat: Like all of us, Italy has to face what I call a 
weakening of our democracies. If we do not fight this danger, I 
say again that we leave the field wide open to the bad shepherds.

  [Text] Luxembourg, Feb 4 (AFP) -- Estimated unemployment in 
the European Community was 10.9 percent in December, unchanged 
from the revised figure for November but a full percentage point 
higher than in December 1992, the EC said Friday [4 February]. 
  Eurostat, the EC's statistical agency, estimated that there 
were 15.8 million people unemployed in the 12-member Community 
last December -- giving an increase of 1.9 million over the 
previous 12 months. 
  It said the average jobless rate for calendar 1993 was 10.5 
percent. The unemployment rate has risen one percentage point a 
year over the last two years. It was 9.9 percent in December 
1992 and 8.9 percent in December 1991. 
  The EC's executive European Commission has predicted that 
the 
rate will peak at around 11.5 percent in mid-1995 before 
beginning to descend. 
  The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in calendar 1993 
rose fastest in Spain, western Germany, Italy and France. The 
smallest increases were recorded in Britain and Ireland. 
  Unemployment last December was highest in Spain (22.5 
percent), followed by Ireland (18.5), Italy (11.5), France 
(11.2), Denmark (10.4), Britain (10.3), Belgium (9.8), the 
Netherlands (9.5 in November), western Germany (6.0), Portugal 
(5.5) and Luxembourg (3.0). 
  No figures were available for Greece or for former East 
Germany.

<F P=106> [Miguel Gonzalez report: "Spain Rejects NATO Proposals That </F>
It Take Part in Air Strikes in Bosnia"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Spain has rejected the requests made 
to it by NATO that it join the air force ready to intervene in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In successive rounds of consultations 
conducted by the secretary general and by the allied military 
commands, the Spanish representatives have replied that Spain's 
contribution to resolving the conflict is more than sufficient 
for the present. Only if the air operations were to be 
prolonged and it were necessary to relieve some of the aircraft 
present in the area could the still valid offer of six F-18 
fighter bombers once made by Spain be made good. 
  The latest of these unofficial approaches was made through 
the military representatives to NATO a month ago, and the 
response was negative, as on previous occasions. 
  Although in principle it was questioned whether the Spanish 
Air Force could carry out "surgical strikes," military sources 
state that the F-18 is the best fighter aircraft in service in 
Europe, and that there are no technical or operational 
objections to taking part in the operation if the government 
gives its approval. 
  Nevertheless, with around 160 aircraft at his disposal, 
Admiral Michael Boorda, chief of NATO's southern command, has 
more than enough resources to eliminate the batteries besieging 
Sarajevo if the United Nations authorizes strikes when the 
ultimatum expires 21 February. 
  In addition to the United States, the UK, France, the 
Netherlands, and Turkey have replied affirmatively to the 
request to contribute aircraft to NATO's plans. Under these 
conditions, Spanish participation is not deemed necessary, and 
so its refusal has not caused annoyance in NATO. 
<H5>  Blue Helmets' Safety </H5>
  A different situation would arise if an escalation in the 
conflict necessitated prolonging the air operations, and it were 
necessary to relieve other allies' aircraft. 
  The Spanish Government once said that the offer of the six 
F-18's at the Zaragoza base was confined to controlling the 
airspace, but it seems unlikely that Spain could refuse, for 
instance, to defend the UN troops when its own blue helmets are 
under the NATO aircraft's protection. 
  The argument used by Spain for not taking part in the 
mission 
is that it is already contributing more than enough to resolving 
the conflict with its 1,200 troops deployed on the scene, as 
well as two frigates, a P-3 Orion aircraft, and a Civil Guard 
patrol boat, which are monitoring the embargo on Serbia. This 
is not being said explicitly, because other countries are in the 
same situation, but the desire to preserve some neutrality in 
order not to endanger the blue helmets also carries weight. 
  Spain even refused to send air traffic controllers to guide 
the aircraft which are to protect the UN troops, for fear that 
this could be interpreted as a hostile action by the warring 
sides, and only did so in the wake of the other countries with 
troops in the area. The protection afforded by these aircraft, 
and, above all, NATO's threat to respond vigorously to any 
aggression against the UN forces, is now the only effective 
defense for the troops. [passage omitted]

Military Team To Aid South African Peacekeepers] 
  [Text] A team of seven British officers is to join others 
from Commonwealth nations in providing advice to peacekeepers 
during the period leading up to South Africa's elections in 
April. 
  Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, has agreed 
that the British team, led by a Colonel, will travel to South 
Africa this month for an initial three month deployment. They 
will be part of the Commonwealth Peacekeeping Assistance Group 
which will advise on the training of South Africa's National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. 
  The request for assistance came from the country's 
Transitional Executive Council and has been coordinated by the 
Commonwealth Secretary General. 
  The role of the Assistance Group will be to advise on and 
monitor the training of the NPKF personnel. 
<H5>  Malcolm Rifkind Said: </H5>
  "I am extremely pleased that we have been asked to assist 
during this important period of South Africa's history. The 
peacekeeping force will have an important job to perform and I 
am confident that our team will do its utmost to support this 
Commonwealth initiative."

<F P=106> [Interview with Leon Brittan, EU commissioner for external </F>
trade, by Lluis Bassets in Brussels; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Bassets] Are you campaigning 
for the Commission's presidency? 
  [Brittan] I am not engaged in an election campaign, because 
it is not decided in an election. It is the heads of government 
who decide this. It is no secret that the British Government is 
supporting my candidacy. It would be an honor and a source of 
satisfaction for me to receive the Community governments' 
support. Of course, everybody knows that my viewpoints are not 
the same as those of the British Government. 
  [Bassets] So the purpose of your visit to Madrid is to make 
known your ideas for the eventuality of a candidacy for the 
presidency. 
  [Brittan] No, the main purpose of my visit is something 
else. 
Over the past few months, while I was directing the GATT Uruguay 
Round negotiation, I had to visit the United States and Japan on 
several occasions. Now it is natural that I should wish to 
visit the European Union [EU] countries in order to explain the 
GATT agreements and to see their subsequent developments. 
Naturally my aim is also to set out my ideas on the EU's 
everyday affairs. 
  [Bassets] You and Mickey Kantor have presented the GATT 
final 
agreement very well, but the agreement on services is not 
substantial. Audiovisual products have been excluded. One 
might say it is like the Maastricht Treaty, with more exceptions 
than rules. 
  [Brittan] I do not accept this description and do not 
recognize this analysis, because it is incorrect. In the 
services sector, we have laid down strict rules which are very 
useful for Europe. In the case of audiovisual products we had 
an insistent demand from the United States that we dismantle the 
limited protection we have for our culture and commit ourselves 
to go no further. We have not dismantled our system of 
protection, and we have not committed ourselves for the future 
or made it our duty to do so. I believe that in this respect 
the Community can be very satisfied. More generally, this is 
the greatest dismantling of tariff and nontariff barriers in 
history. Therefore it cannot be said that it is an empty shell. 
  [Bassets] But it is, in services. 
  [Brittan] That is not true in services either. You have to 
look at the agreement as a whole, which means an extensive 
reduction of tariffs and the removal of many barriers. The 
trading system's operating rules have been strengthened, and 
this prevents the Americans or anybody else from adopting 
measures unilaterally. We are going to set up a world trade 
organization -- a central concern of the EU, which met with U.S. 
opposition. All this has been achieved, including the services 
sector in this; in some cases through specific agreements and in 
others through agreements on the negotiating framework within 
new rules. 
  [Bassets] Allow me to contradict you. You and Kantor took 
up the negotiation when an attempt was being made to avert 
catastrophe, and you succeeded, but you cannot deny that many of 
the chapters have been shelved and that the expectations which 
were aroused have not been satisfied. 
  [Brittan] It is the first time that services have been 
included in an international agreement, and so it is not strange 
that the agreements are not as spectacular as was hoped. What 
was achieved in addition to goods -- in intellectual property, 
which is especially important for Europe -- must also be taken 
into account. But I insist that it is not true that there is no 
substance in services. Considerable progress has been made, but 
it is true that much more could have been made. 
  [Bassets] Do you deem it a priority now to tackle social and 
ecological dumping, as Clinton and Delors believe, for instance? 
  [Brittan] The priority is to complete the formalities of the 
Uruguay Round, implement it, and begin dialogue with European 
manufacturers to see how the maximum benefit can he derived from 
it. Then comes the opening of new areas of negotiation. One of 
the first is undoubtedly the relationship between trade and the 
environment. Another is the rules of competition policy, 
insofar as it can affect trade. Yet another is social issues. 
In fact, there are no disagreements on the issue of social 
dumping. It is necessary to distinguish what has to do with 
human rights, such as trade resulting from the activity of 
prisoners or children, from the economic issues. We must be 
very careful about matters connected with the cost of manpower. 
Depending on which criterion we apply, Spain, for instance, 
would not be able to export to other European countries owing to 
the lower cost of its manpower. 
  [Bassets] There is a certain fear in the southern countries 
of a loss of weight and influence. Do you believe that this is 
well-founded? 
  [Brittan] There are two different points in your question. 
One is the aim on which the Community should concentrate now, 
and the other is the specific countries' rights and influence. 
The Commission has traditionally supported the small countries, 
and I believe that it is right that it should continue to do so, 
but Spain is not a small country. It is a large and influential 
country, and I would even say one with increasing influence in 
all fields, and so I do not believe that it should be concerned 
about loss of influence as a southern country. The other 
problem is what the EU should now concentrate on. I believe 
this is where the greatest changes have occurred with the end of 
communism. There should clearly be a balance with respect to 
the southern countries, a balance which should mean a greater 
development of our own Mediterranean policies and particular 
care in relations with the southern Mediterranean countries. 
Not, as is said, in order to stop immigration to Spain or 
wherever. It is a broader issue than all this. I do not wish 
to express my disagreement with current policies but rather to 
support strongly a balance of policies, also aimed at North 
Africa. 
  [Bassets] Spain's weight in the European institutions is 
less 
than is appropriate in terms of its size, principally in key 
posts, if it is compared with countries such as France or 
Germany, which have played the leading role in European 
building. Do you believe that things should change over the 
next few years? 
  [Brittan] Curiously, the United Kingdom shares the same 
impression. This happens not because there is unfair 
discrimination with respect to certain countries. It is a 
result of history and of national cultures and traditions. We 
should encourage the people in the less represented countries to 
submit their candidacies, and then they must be supported in 
order to adjust the current situation. 
  [Bassets] You present yourself as a perfectly orthodox 
commissioner with respect to the current institutional 
framework, and say that you disagree with the British 
Government, but the latter is supporting you in your candidacy. 
Are you the antifederal candidate? 
  [Brittan] My stance cannot be identified with that of the 
British Government. I have been an explicit and persistent 
supporter of economic and monetary union. I believe that it is 
economically desirable and that it is a basic aspect of European 
integration. This is no secret, and it is not for me to explain 
why the government supports me more or less. Nor have I changed 
my views or intend to change them. Whether or not I undertake 
new responsibilities, I will continue to work for the creation 
of a single currency and of economic and monetary union, as I 
have done so far. 
  [Bassets] So how would you explain the nuances in your views 
on the British plan for a huge trading area in which you people 
would occupy the central place? 
  [Brittan] No, no. Perhaps that is some people's aim, but 
not John Major's. The British Government's view, which I share, 
is that the Community is now a union -- not just a free trade 
area. 
  [Bassets] But Delors himself has said that the British idea 
is prevailing and the Franco-German idea of a more federal and 
united Europe is receding. 
  [Brittan] I do not believe that the future of building 
Europe can be presented as a matter between two extremes. There 
are many qualified stances, and, moreover, there is no question 
of dividing Europe into two blocs again.

<F P=106> [Report by Lionel Barber in Brussels: "Spain's Cash Plea </F>
Threatens EU Enlargement Talks"] 
  [Text] The European Union's [EU] drive to complete 
enlargement negotiations with Sweden, Finland, Austria and 
Norway by the end of the month risks being sidetracked by a 
Spanish claim for extra money from the applicant countries. 
  Madrid says the four applicants are all likely net 
contributors to the EU budget and that the resulting cash 
payments should go to the poorer member states, including 
Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. 
  The intervention has dismayed other EU states who fear a 
budget row might sink the chance of meeting the March 1 deadline 
required for enlargement to go ahead in January 1995. 
  The accession negotiations in Brussels are finely poised, 
with hard bargaining taking place over regional aid and special 
assistance to Nordic farmers. An internal budget row could 
wreck an early conclusion of the talks. 
  Estimates of how much the Swedes, Finns, Austrians and 
Norwegians are likely to contribute to the EU's ECU70bn budget 
are still preliminary. Some figures suggest cash transfers 
might range between ECU2bn and ECU4bn a year, depending on their 
economic output. 
  The UK and Germany are already restive about the amount of 
money the EU sends to southern Europe. British estimates range 
from ECU7m daily to Greece and Portugal, and ECU13m a day to 
Spain. 
  In December 1992, Spain withheld its support for early 
enlargement negotiations until it won backing from its partners 
for a "cohesion fund" for special transfers to the EU budget 
from the rich north and centre to be funnelled to the south. 
  Last week in Brussels, Spain indicated it would like its 
partners to agree on the principle that all net contributions 
from applicant states should be used to "top up" the cohesion 
fund. 
  Some EU delegations were left with the impression that Spain 
wants an agreement on the exact level of individual 
contributions from Nordic and Alpine states. "That would 
scupper any chance of meeting the March 1 deadline," said one 
Brussels official. 
  A Spanish official declined to confirm or deny the country's 
position on the applicant countries' net budget payments. 
  Spain has taken a consistently tough line in the enlargement 
negotiations, partly because it is worried that the momentum 
toward European integration is moving decisively northward. 
  Last year, Spain insisted that the applicants be left out of 
the Maastricht treaty's mechanisms for setting up a single 
European currency. It still says only the 12 should be 
considered eligible for European monetary union.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Statement by Vanni D'Archirafi on </F>
Delay in Schengen Agreement"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE 
database] 
  [Text] In a statement on the new delay in enforcement of 
the Schengen Agreement on the abolition of controls on people at 
borders, European Commissioner Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi began 
by saying that the "true value" of technical difficulties that 
have been an obstacle to the system should be taken into 
account. No political meaning (which they do not have or, if at 
all, only very slightly) should be attributed to them. Once 
more, Mr. Vanni d'Archirafi stressed what a difficult exercise 
this was, mainly because the member states do not all make the 
same interpretation of the former Article 8a (now Article 7a) on 
the abolition of controls on people at the borders of the Union. 
Be this as it may, Mr. Vanni d'Archirafi sees some "hopeful 
elements." These mainly lie in the attitude of the German Chair 
of the Schengen Group (until end June), in the fact that "even 
Austria" has officially asked for observer status with the 
Schengen Group, and in indications according to which "it is not 
to be ruled out that the Danish position may develop along the 
same lines." 
  Furthermore, the Commissioner recalled that "at least 95 
percent, if not 97 or 98 percent, of free movement has already 
been achieved." Although some controls still exist (mainly 
because security problems have not been settled), the right of 
free movement is not disputed. He went on to say that the 
European Commission has proved its will to take concrete 
initiatives at the appropriate moment by proposing decisions 
concerning visas and the convention on external frontiers, and 
it plans to make other proposals in close sequence over coming 
months. Despite the above explanations, the judgment of MEPs 
[member of European Parliament] on the European Commission's 
attitude is very severe. If, by European elections in June, 
Schengen is not in force, then the European Commission will have 
failed on one of the most important questions, said German 
Christian Democrat Karl von Wogau for whom the present situation 
is a "scandal." Mr. Jarzembowski, also German Christian 
Democrat, agreed that the "Commission has failed," and that the 
purely intergovernmental path which had been chosen also failed: 
European Union, he said, needs Community solutions, and the 
European Parliament is ready to contribute. The MEP moreover 
encouraged Italy, Greece and Portugal to overcome the delays in 
the practical implementation of the Schengen Accord and those 
countries not able to accede to the Accord at least adopt 
security measures comparable to those planned for the Schengen 
countries, and insisted on the need for border controls to be 
lifted before the summer vacations. Belgian Socialist Mr. Van 
Outrive urged the Commission to be clear over the proposals 
concerning the third pillar of Maastricht. Is it still of any 
use for the Commission to take part in work over Schengen? he 
wondered. Are you mocking us, Monsieur le Commissaire? asked the 
Dutch Liberal Mr. Wijsenbeek. You tell us you will make 
proposals, he complained, well that is your duty; you must act, 
otherwise you must go. Would you be ready to refuse to show 
your passport and if necessary take the authorities who continue 
to control people at borders to court? asked Mr. Verhagen, Dutch 
Christian-Democrat. You discredit yourself in claiming that 
free movement was 95 percent guaranteed, as its a `total lack of 
knowledge of reality,' said the French Liberal Mr. Delorozoy to 
the Commissioner (who repeated that free movement and control 
should not be confused). As for Mr. Froment-Meurice, he spoke 
out against the "totally unfounded accusations" according to 
which France is alleged to be responsible for Schengen not 
functioning. It is untrue, he said: The system did not work 
because the permanent working party (made up of directors for 
transmissions from the interior ministries of the eight Schengen 
countries) "had no pattern." It is not even a question of 
intergovernmental, but of "infra-intergovernmental," the MEP 
noted, shouting, "for God's sake, let's no longer lock ourselves 
into the intergovernmental." 
  The European Commissioner tried to defend himself from the 
criticisms, notably by pointing out that the "accompanying 
measures" necessary to implement Schengen were not being 
applied. I make no promise as to dates, I never have, he added, 
but I hope in the coming months. And he quoted the Italian 
writer Manzoni to defend his cautious approach, having one of 
his characters say "forward Pedro, but with wisdom."

<F P=106> [Lionel Barber report: "Call To Open Up European Maze"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- Decision-making in the European Union 
[EU] has become so complex that it is impossible for the 
ordinary citizen to understand, according to the EU's senior 
lawyer in Brussels. 
  Mr Jean-Claude Piris, head of the European Council's legal 
service, says the Maastricht Treaty is partly to blame. New 
procedures and rules have turned the EU into a "veritable 
labyrinth." 
  According to a paper circulating in Brussels, Mr Piris 
argues 
that reforms under way, though useful, do not go far enough. 
"In order to be genuinely accepted and properly understood, the 
system ought to be profoundly reformed one day, so as to move 
toward more transparency." 
  Mr Piris was involved in drafting the Maastricht Treaty. He 
also devised the formula which allowed the Danish government to 
argue it had won legally binding opt-outs, securing a decisive 
win in a second referendum last year. 
  Mr Piris concedes reform of decision-making will be 
difficult 
because it implies a choice between those favouring deeper 
integration and those, such as the UK, preferring looser 
inter-governmental co-operation. 
  The complex, opaque nature of decision-making in Brussels 
results from the need to compromise between these forces, not 
because of anonymous "diplomats and technocrats" who took part 
in the Maastricht negotiations, he says. 
  Mr Piris suggests several reforms: 
  1. A "single, shorter, more readable treaty" which would 
consolidate texts such as the Treaty of Rome, Single European 
Act, Maastricht and others governing EU operation. 
  2. Clearer demarcation of areas of responsibility for 
Council, Commission and Parliament, as well as between the Union 
and member states. 
  3. Modification of decision-making processes. Ministers 
involved in decision-making must at present follow at least 20 
different procedures within Maastricht's framework. 
  4. Streamlining the way the EU acts and is represented 
abroad. This could mean a seat for the EU at General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva rather than separate 
national seats. 
  In his paper, Mr Piris argues strongly that the EU has done 
more to improve efficiency, transparency, and democracy than 
first realised. 
  He points to new powers gained by the European Parliament 
for 
scrutinising the European Commission; the creation of a European 
Ombudsman; publication of the Commission's legislative programme 
in the Official Journal in Brussels; and improved access to the 
public for official documents.

<F P=106> [Report by Philip Stephens, political editor: "Major Deepens </F>
Tory Divisions on Europe"] 
  [Text] Mr John Major yesterday disowned all the central 
elements of the manifesto on which the Conservatives' allies in 
the European Parliament will fight its elections in June. 
  Confirming the increasingly Euro-sceptic stance of his 
government in the approach to the polls, he said the 
Conservatives planned a "distinctively British" platform. 
  To the dismay of Conservative MPs on the pro-European wing 
of 
the party, Mr Major agreed with one of his party's leading 
Euro-sceptics that the manifesto of the European Peoples' Party 
[EPP] should be brushed aside. 
  The Conservatives have formal links with the EPP, the 
alliance in Strasbourg which represents most of the Christian 
Democrat parties in the rest of the European Union. The EPP 
finances the offices at Conservative Central Office in London 
run by Tory members of the European Parliament. 
  But in the Commons yesterday Mr William Cash, one of the MPs 
at the forefront of the anti-Maastricht campaign, urged the 
prime minister to disassociate the party "from the EPP's call 
for a single currency, a European central bank, the social 
chapter and a common immigration policy." 
  Mr Major replied that the government was not obliged to 
accept those policies, adding: "Nor will we." 
  His comments, however, brought private warnings from senior 
figures on the centre-left of the party that an anti-Brussels 
stance in the election campaign would risk a new split. 
  One middle-ranking minister said he was "appalled" by the 
tone of some of the government's recent statements. 
  Mr Major attacked Labour for allegedly signing up to the 
"centralising" policy of its socialist partners.

<F P=106> [Ian Davidson article: "Pains of Growth"] </F>
  [Text] Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK's foreign secretary, has 
called on the country's ruling Conservative party to unite round 
a common manifesto for the European parliament elections in 
June, and not to refight last year's battles over the Maastricht 
Treaty. He urged Conservatives to stand as "the party of 
Europe," confident that the UK government's vision of a loose, 
free-trading European Union was now becoming the new orthodoxy 
in Europe. 
  Mr Hurd's anxiety is as understandable as it is acute. In 
the ordinary course of events, the European parliament election 
campaign would be likely to be fought as a plebiscite on the 
government's domestic record, not on the future of the EU 
[European Union]. Since the government is deeply unpopular, the 
elections risk being a disaster for the Tories. But the 
disaster will be all the greater if, in addition, the campaign 
becomes the scene for another virulent slanging match over 
Europe between the two halves of the Tory party. 
  If Mr Hurd succeeds in papering over his party's split over 
Europe, he will be lucky. Unfortunately, it is simply not true 
that the UK government's vision of a loose EU is now the new 
orthodoxy in Europe. What is true is that there is now no 
accepted orthodoxy on the future of the EU, because the Union is 
in a state of profound political malaise. 
  The reason for this malaise is that the Union has been 
completely overtaken by the speed and scale of events in the 
real world outside. When the Maastricht Treaty was put 
together, in the brief moment of ecstasy after the fall of the 
Berlin Wall, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl thought they were concluding a grand Franco-German 
Euro-bargain for the internal development of the EU, as a 
counterpart to German unification. They did not foresee that 
their private deal might be ship-wrecked by the storms on the 
world's foreign exchange markets, or by war in the Balkans. 
  In addition, the Union has lost credibility with the voters, 
and therefore with politicians, because it has failed to 
exorcise recession or avert rising structural unemployment. 
Once upon a time, Europe was sold on the prospectus that 
economic integration would deliver growth, in spite of the 
transitional pain of European economic liberalism. Today, 
Europe's workers are being asked to accept that their jobs and 
the postwar European socioeconomic model may be thrown on the 
garbage heap for the sake of a global economic liberalism that 
bypasses anything decided in Brussels or indeed in any national 
capital. 
  As a result, the EU is now plunged into a gloom as deep as 
the phase of Euro-pessimism of 10 years ago. Since that earlier 
pessimism then gave way to an equally intense phase of 
Euro-phoria, with the Single European Act and the collapse of 
communism, some may reasonably ask if the present depression may 
not turn out to be just another passing phase. 
  It may. But there at least two reasons why it may not. The 
first lies in the shortcomings of the Maastricht treaty. The 
plan for economic and monetary union may not be dead, as the 
jeering Euro-sceptics would have us believe, but its future is 
at best uncertain. The equally grand scheme for a common 
foreign and security policy always looked over-ambitious; in the 
light of events in former Yugoslavia, it now looks merely 
flatulent. 
  With hindsight it seems clear that the practical 
prescriptions contained in the Maastricht Treaty fell short of 
the stated objectives. If the member states really want 
monetary union, they probably need to make a bigger political 
commitment; if they want a common foreign policy, they obviously 
have to make a much bigger political commitment. Right now the 
Union has a treaty whose stated ambitions exceed its grasp; but 
there is no general willingness to strengthen the treaty so as 
to make its aims attainable. 
  But the disagreement between the member states on where the 
EU is going, or how to get there, is made much worse because 
they do not know how many members it will have; and this is the 
second reason for gloom. The fall of the Berlin Wall has 
released a flood of eager candidates: four members of the 
European Free Trade Association are negotiating now, and there 
is a platoon of other countries waiting to join. It should be 
obvious that a much larger Union will be a very different Union. 
But the present member states cannot resolve the problem of 
what such a large EU should look like, because they are still 
impaled on the ideological argument between nationalists and 
federalists. 
  This unresolved ideological argument is bound to cut across 
the question of EU enlargement, and might conceivably prevent 
it. The European parliament, which now has the power to ratify 
enlargement, said two years ago that it would not agree to new 
members unless its own powers were strengthened; yet it seems 
unlikely that members will renegotiate the Maastricht treaty, 
and certainly not in the middle of negotiations with the EFTA 
[European Free Trade Association] candidates. In the event, 
parliament may hesitate to veto enlargement. But this week such 
a threat came from Spain, which suggested that it might block 
the admission of the rich EFTA countries, without an increase in 
regional aid to the poorer countries of the Mediterranean. 
  In other words, enlargement may yet become a negotiating 
pivot for the Union's old ideological arguments. But these 
arguments cannot effectively be addressed at least until France 
has a new president next year, and probably not until the 
Maastricht review conference of 1996. The present phase of 
Euro-gloom could be with us for a long time yet.

<F P=106> [Robert Taylor article: "Ministers Consider Pulling Out of </F>
ILO"] 
  [Text] Ministers are deciding whether to withdraw the UK 
from the International Labour Organisation [ILO] in protest at 
the growing threat of condemnation of its industrial relations 
policies at this June's ILO conference. 
  The main cause for expected ILO censure is the ban on trade 
unions at the GCHQ [Government Communications Headquarters] 
communications headquarters in Cheltenham. The ban was 
introduced just over 10 years ago by Baroness Thatcher. 
  Efforts to settle the issue failed last December after a 
meeting between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and civil 
service union leaders. 
  Mr Major said he believed there was a conflict of loyalty 
between a worker belonging to a union and working in the 
communications centre. 
  The talks had been encouraged by the ILO in 1992 as a way of 
trying to end the deadlock. Now the Trades Union Congress is 
seeking an ILO censure of the government in June. The matter is 
being discussed by the ILO's Committee of Experts, which will 
decide by April whether to recommend condemnation. 
  Union leaders believe Britain could be given a "special 
paragraph" of criticism in the ILO annual report, a sanction 
that has been used against Haiti and North Korea. 
  Under the ILO's procedures, Britain would have to give two 
years' notice of its intention to pull out of the organisation. 
It would also be bound by conventions it had signed on good 
labour standards even if it was no longer a member. 
  Ministers have also suspended plans that were being drawn up 
in the Department of Employment to commemorate the ILO 
anniversary. These included a dinner and the establishment of a 
fellowship for workers from developing countries.

<F P=106> [Tim Coone article: "Sinn Fein Peppered by Ceasefire Calls"] </F>
  [Text] A message from grassroots public opinion was 
hammered home to the leadership of Sinn Fein at the weekend. It 
said clearly that a continuation of the IRA military campaign 
was an obstacle to progress in the peace process. 
  The refusal by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to rush 
into a response to December's Downing Street declaration may 
smack of pedantry, procrastination and downright deviousness. 
But if the message that was repeatedly stated at the latest 
hearing of its "Peace Commission" has found its target, then the 
wait will have been worth it. 
  The Sinn Fein Peace Commission consists of a series of 
public 
hearings in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, in which 
written and oral submissions on the peace process and the 
Downing Street declaration are being invited from the public. 
  The first was held in Londonderry two weeks ago. The second 
was held this weekend in a Dublin hotel and two more are 
scheduled to be held in the republic before Sinn Fein's annual 
congress at the end of this month. 
  Somewhat surprisingly, the submissions made in Dublin were 
neither acrimonious diatribes from opponents, nor eulogies of 
regurgitated republicanism from sympathisers. For the most part 
they were carefully argued presentations, coming from people as 
diverse as Jesuit priests, trade unonists, community 
associations, civil rights activists, peace groups hostile to 
Sinn Fein, writers and even musicians. 
  One of the most cogent presentations came from Mr Michael 
Farrell, a solicitor and civil rights activist who is widely 
respected in republican and nationalist circles. 
  He started by arguing that the joint declaration and the 
British government had failed to address nationalist fears 
adequately. But he went on to say that Sinn Fein had been 
"unconvincing" in trying to draw a distinction between the joint 
declaration's guarantee to respect the majority wishes in 
Northern Ireland -- described by Sinn Fein as the unionist 
"veto" -- and the Hume-Adams statements which the IRA supports, 
which speak of the need for unionist consent to any new 
political settlement. 
  Moreover, continuation of the IRA campaign while 
clarification of the Downing Street declaration was being sought 
"is irresponsible and inconsistent with (the IRA's) own support 
for the Hume-Adams proposals," he said. 
  "Whatever the situation in the past, the means are now in 
place to allow republicans to secure their objectives by 
political action. I do not believe the IRA's armed struggle 
could achieve anything more. Indeed I think it is 
counterproductive," he said. 
  Most of the 25 submissions carried a similar message. The 
British government should be pressed to offer guarantees to 
protect the civil rights and Irish identity of the nationalist 
minority in Northern Ireland to balance the "fulsome guarantees 
offered to the unionists." But in spite of this weakness from a 
nationalist point of view, the Downing Street declaration had 
opened up new opportunities. Most importantly, a ceasefire 
should be declared. 
  Mr Michael Nugent of the New Consensus movement, a long-time 
opponent of the IRA and Sinn Fein, called for the party to "test 
the bona fides" of the joint declaration and for the IRA to 
declare "a temporary and indefinite ceasefire." This, he said, 
"would open up an entirely new situation." 
  The Sinn Fein convener of the Commission said: "We are 
taking 
the submissions very seriously indeed."

<F P=106> [David Sharrock report: "U.S. Report Attack Ulster Security </F>
Forces"] 
  [Text] Belfast -- The role of the security forces in 
Northern Ireland is strongly criticised in an official United 
States report to be shown to President Clinton before his 
meeting with John Major this month. Two other human rights 
reports published this week call for an independent public 
inquiry into alleged collusion between security forces and 
loyalist paramilitaries. 
  President Clinton will be briefed on the State Department 
report before he meets the Prime Minister in Washington on 
February 27. Its contents, should they be raised at the meeting, 
will further sour the "special relationship" between the two 
countries, strained by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams's visit 
to New York last week. 
  The report gives details of recent killings and judicial 
proceedings. "Although no deaths resulted from shootings by 
security forces (in 1993), charges continued that soldiers 
resorted to lethal force precipitately and carried out a `shoot 
to kill' policy," it says. 
  "Security forces, both the army and Royal Ulster 
Constabulary 
[RUC], frequently harass citizens verbally, particularly young 
people in areas where community support for terrorists is 
considered strong. Security forces have also been accused of 
more serious incidents of physical mistreatment." 
  In Political Killings in Northern Ireland, published today, 
Amnesty International accuses the Government of evading its duty 
to investigate "mounting evidence of collusion between 
government forces and groups like the banned Ulster Defence 
Association [UDA] that oppose any change in Northern lreland's 
status quo.... The Government must make every effort to show 
equal concern for all members of the population, by guaranteeing 
equal protection." 
  And the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of 
Justice has this week published a report on allegations of 
harassment in connection with incidents involving the use of 
lethal force. Of 20 families interviewed by the Committee, nine 
reported that their deceased family member had received death 
threats by police or soldiers. 
  All three reports note the killing of some 350 people by the 
security forces since 1969. Most were Catholics, about half of 
whom were unarmed. Up to 1991, 21 security force members were 
prosecuted for killings using firearms. Nineteen were found not 
guilty, one was convicted of manslaughter and given a suspended 
sentence. Only one, a soldier, was convicted of murder. 
Although given a life sentence, he served just over two years 
and was then reinstated in the army. 
  Amnesty says: "The pattern that has emerged is one of 
repeated allegtions that suspects are arbitrarily killed rather 
than being arrested, that members of the security forces believe 
they can operate with impunity, and that this is reinforced by 
government failure to take steps to prevent unlawful killings. 
  "The Government evades responsibility by hiding behind an 
array of legal procedures and secret inquiries." 
  It calls for an independent inquiry into the murder of 
Patrick Finucane, a lawyer shot dead in February 1989 by the 
outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the role played by Brian 
Nelson, a UDA member and army informer sentenced to 10 years' 
imprisonment last year for conspiracy to murder. 
  It also calls for the widening of the Stevens inquiry, which 
in 1989 investigated security leaks to loyalist groups and which 
was reopened last year after Mr Nelson's trial. "The apparent 
failure of the security forces to take significant action 
against UDA `death squads' was not addressed before the court," 
Amnesty says. 
  The report considers allegations that the RUC has been 
negligent in gathering evidence about loyalist attacks on 
catholics, that it has failed to respond adequately to demands 
for protection and has failed to deter loyalist paramilitaries 
from entering catholic areas or to detect them despite 
surveillance. 
  "The facility with which loyalist gunmen raid homes in 
stringently monitored and controlled Catholic neighbourhoods and 
then leave witout hindrance has contributed to the lack of 
confidence in the RUC," Amnesty says.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "News Review" column: "Adams and the </F>
Alliance"] 
  [Text] The disgraceful decision by President Clinton to 
grant a visa to one of the world's leading terrorists (whose 
public front is to pose as the IRA's peace-loving political 
apologist, a propaganda act of Orwellian proportions swallowed 
enthusiastically by gullible American journalists) is only a 
blip in the never-ending story of the Ulster troubles. But it 
speaks volumes for the manner in which Mr Clinton chooses to 
conduct American foreign policy and the sorry consequences it 
has had for the Anglo-American relationship. 
  The president was advised by his secretary of state, his 
attorney general, his ambassador in London, his consulate in 
Belfast and even by the director of the FBI that there should be 
no visa for a man who talks peace but practices terror. Mr 
Clinton chose to overrule them on the pretext that Mr Adams' 
visit would help the peace process (though quite how it was to 
be furthered by allowing the greatest obstacle to peace to 
grandstand, largely unchallenged, for 48 hours on America's 
airwaves was never explained). This was a shamefaced deceit: 
the president already knew from his own intelligence reports 
that Mr Adams has no intention of signing up to the Anglo-Irish 
peace accord. But Mr Clinton had the Irish-American lobby to 
assuage. 
  Some 40 members of Congress, including two of its most 
powerful senators from the Irish lobby, Edward Kennedy and 
Patrick Moynihan, wanted Mr Adams in and Mr Clinton needs their 
votes for his current political priority, his controversial 
healthcare reforms (Mr Moynihan has been a critic of the reforms 
and, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is in a key 
position to thwart them). So, for the sake of domestic 
political advantage, the president opened the gate. 
Presidential aides even coached Mr Adams on the weasel words of 
peace he should mouth to give the president cover for his 
shameful decision. The fact that it meant slighting America's 
closest ally and plunging the special relationship into its 
worst crisis since Suez counted for nought. 
  The harsh fact for Britain is that in Mr Clinton's 
Washington 
that relationship does indeed increasingly count for nothing. 
This is an administration which, when it thinks of foreign 
policy (and that it does rarely), thinks of Asia. It does so 
because its foreign policy objectives are almost entirely 
conditioned by its domestic agenda. Candidate Clinton summed up 
his domestic priority with these watchwords: "The economy, 
stupid." Today, Japan is the yardstick by which America judges 
its economic success. The central thrust of Mr Clinton's 
international economic policy is at the heart of his foreign 
policy. He wants to open up the burgeoning markets of the 
Pacific Rim, particularly Japan, to American products, services 
and investment. Foreign policy is as much about job creation 
for Mr Clinton as it is about diplomacy. He thinks a lot about 
the economic opportunities for America in Japan, China, South 
Korea and Vietnam; he thinks very little about Europe -- and 
almost not at all about Britain. 
  This is bad news for Europe because so many of the foreign 
policy challenges it faces, such as Bosnia and Russia, cry out 
for the leadership of an involved, confident American president. 
But Mr Clinton is not interested. It is particularly bad news 
for Britain. As the European country closest to the United 
States we have the most to lose from American disengagement. It 
is a plight made all the worse by personal rancour between 
Downing Street and the White House. It still rankles with Mr 
Clinton that Conservative Central Office worked with the Bush 
campaign during the 1992 election; and there is no forgiveness 
from the president or some of his closest advisers that the Home 
Office, at the behest of the Bush campaign, searched its files 
for the time Mr Clinton was at Oxford to see if there was 
anything juicy (there wasn't). "Bill Clinton does not have a 
great fondness for John Major," a senior presidential aide told 
THE SUNDAY TIMES this week, with evident understatement. A 
White House foreign policy adviser was more blunt: "Clinton 
hates Major." 
  It was perhaps inevitable that there would be some cooling 
of 
the special relationship after Margaret Thatcher, who was a 
towering world figure and enjoyed especially close relations 
with Ronald Reagan and George Bush. It is inconceivable, for 
example, that Mr Adams would have won his visa during the 
Thatcher years. "The departure of Thatcher means that Britain is 
less on the American mind these days," says one senior White 
House official. "She was consulted on almost everything. 
Clinton does not really care what Major thinks, and never 
thinks of asking him. Major had to struggle to get a 10-minute 
bilateral meeting with the president at the NATO summit." The 
White House is also well aware that Mr Major is a prime minister 
in deep domestic trouble, which only adds to his lack of clout 
in Washington. 
  Mr Major's particular problems in Washington, however, only 
give personal edge to greater forces that are pulling Mr 
Clinton's America away from Europe. It is, perhaps, inevitable 
that any American president, with the end of the cold war, would 
want to look east, where economic growth is often in double 
digits and growing affluence has created a gigantic market of 
several billion new consumers, rather than a sclerotic Europe, 
self-absorbed with its own problems, such as Maastricht and the 
European exchange-rate mechanism (unintelligible to most 
Enropeans, never mind Americans), and wallowing in a recession 
which has only reinforced the American view that, on the brink 
of the new information age, Europe is in the dark ages. 
  Of course, long-standing transatlantic ties cannot be undone 
overnight. America and Europe are not about to cast each other 
adrift. The Anglo-American relationship may be less than 
special these days, but both countries remain bound by cultural, 
economic, intelligence and nuclear ties; and events could easily 
reverse Mr Clinton's eastward-looking strategy. There is at 
least an even chance within the next few years of a more 
authoritarian regime in Moscow, which would make the security of 
East Europe less secure; and there is the probability of serious 
strife between Russia and the Ukraine. Either would force 
Washington to look to Europe once more as the frontline of its 
national security, and breathe new life into the Atlantic 
alliance. In the meantime, Britain's politicians would be best 
employed giving some thought to where exactly this country's 
future lies, in a world in which the special relationship has 
diminished, but close relations with a Maastricht-style Europe 
are still suspect.

<F P=106> [Article by Conor Cruise O'Brien: "These Days the Lion Only </F>
Whines"] 
  [Text] There will be a special relationship, of one kind 
or another, between Britain and the United States as long as 
there is an English language. But the relationship is in worse 
shape, politically speaking, in 1994 than at any time since Suez. 
  The damage is at its worst among the Democrats, and this is 
extremely serious, since they have majorities in both houses of 
Congress, as well as the presidency. But the Republicans don't 
have much use for Britain's present government, either, even 
though that government went to such extraordinary lengths to 
help George Bush in the presidential election of 1992, thus 
alienating the winner, Bill Clinton. But the Republicans of 
today don't want to know about George Bush anymore than about 
John Major. A Republican flier has just been issued in 
connection with this year's mid-term congressional elections. 
It carries pictures of three worthies: Ronald Reagan, Margaret 
Thatcher and Bob Dole. This is a reminder of how great the 
relationship once was, and now is not. 
  All Americans knew who Mrs Thatcher was. Most admired her, 
and all who could conceivably vote Republican not only admired 
her when she was prime minister but still admire her. That is 
why her picture is on that flier. 
  The Tories, when they ditched Mrs Thatcher, may possibly 
have 
been doing the right thing by their party, and for its fortunes 
in Britain. But they were throwing away a great asset in 
international relations, especially relations with America. And 
Britain acquired, in place of that asset, a liability. If 
Britain repudiated that marvellous Margaret Thatcher, well, 
there must be something wrong with Britain, mustn't there? 
  As for Mr Major, his name and image carry hardly any 
connotations here. But for those who do know something about 
him, the connotations are negative, consisting mainly of a vague 
impression that he is the guy who stabbed Mrs Thatcher in the 
back. 
  The deterioration shows in a number of ways. There is the 
decision to ignore British protests and sell aircraft with 
advanced radar to Argentina. That could not have happened under 
Mrs Thatcher. There is increasing talk of an emerging 
Franco-American leadership, especially over Bosnia. Britain is 
presented as dragging its feet over Bosnia. I believe Britain 
was right to oppose the drift towards military intervention. 
But for the present it is the French who are giving a lead in 
the direction favoured by popular opinion in America. 
  Then there is the small but revealing episode of Gerry Adams 
and his visa. First of all, Mr Adams would not have been 
granted an American visa while Mrs Thatcher was prime minister. 
Mrs Thatcher inspired fear, both in Washington and in Dublin. 
Mr Major inspires nothing in particular, in either capital. 
Since the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December, with its 
fatal concession of the Hume-Adams wording on 
self-determination, Albert Reynolds has been under the 
impression that he can get away with pretty well anything where 
the present British government is concerned, even getting an 
American visa for the political head of the Provisional IRA, 
while the IRA's "armed struggle" against Britain continues. 
  The granting of that visa was one symptom of a general 
deterioration in Anglo-American relations. But the consequences 
of granting the visa have accelerated the deterioration. This 
was not mainly a result of Gerry Adams' anti-British tirades on 
Larry King Live and elsewhere. These reached huge audiences but 
embarrassed his more respectable sponsors, who had bought the 
line that Mr Adams is now an earnest seeker after peace. There 
was consequently a certain revulsion against him in influential 
quarters. 
  But then Mr Major's government, by the form of its protest, 
compounded the damage already done. It is in general 
inadvisable for a government to protest publicly against 
something it has been unable to stop. This only advertises the 
inability in question. And this was all the worse because the 
inability was the result not of harsh fate but of sheer 
incompetence. 
  Mr Major could have nipped that visa in the bud. He should 
have known what Albert Reynolds was up to and made him stop. He 
should have called on Mr Reynolds to oppose -- as all previous 
Irish governments have done -- the granting of a visa to the 
president of Sinn Fein. He should have warned Mr Reynolds that 
if he failed to do so, he would be placing the future of the 
Anglo-Irish agreement in danger. Had Mr Major done that, Mr 
Reynolds would have advised Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and 
Edward Kennedy to withhold support from this year's visa 
application as from previous ones, and the visa would not have 
been granted. 
  Having failed to prevent what he could quietly have 
prevented, Mr Major then protested at the top of his voice: 
several decibels too loud to be of help to Anglo-American 
relations in their present frail condition. To send a formal 
protest to the British ambassador in Washington would have been 
enough. To carpet the American ambassador in London was far too 
flamboyant. It inevitably evoked the anti-British component 
always latent American nationalism. 
  The New York Times is rather less nationalistic than most 
Americans and is generally not anti-British. Yet its comment on 
the carpeting of the America ambassador was the nastiest I have 
seen in a respectable American newspaper in relation to an ally 
of the United States. The editorial appeared Saturday under the 
headline: "The Lion Whines About Mr Adams." The heading 
faithfully reflects the hostile and contemptuous tone of the 
whole editorial. 
  The argument was on First Amendment lines, as if this was a 
British attempt to impose censorship on the United States, 
instead of a protest against the granting of a visa to a known 
enemy of Britain and a spokesman for terrorism. But the tone of 
the editorial was unmistakably that of aroused American 
nationalism on an anti-British binge. Intellectually, the 
editorial is contemptible, but as a symptom of dangerous forces 
at work in unexpected places it must be taken seriously. 
  In general, there may not be a lot Mr Major can do about 
improving Anglo-American relations. But there is one not 
insignificant area in which he can do something. He can warn 
Dublin -- belatedly but still effectively -- that if it again 
lends itself to making trouble for Britain in the US, it will 
undermine the Anglo-Irish agreement through activities 
incompatible with the spirit of that agreement. Mr Reynolds 
would take such a warning seriously. 
  For the rest, Mr Major should reflect that he has now to 
mend 
his fences with a US administration which his government 
foolishly strove to prevent from ever coming into being. He has 
a lot to live down. President Clinton's hero is John F Kennedy, 
whose motto was: "Forgive your enemies, but remember their 
names."

`Bowed to U.S. Pressure' Over Bosnia Ultimatum"] 
  [Text] Britain acquiesced in this week's NATO ultimatum to 
the Serbian forces besieging Sarajevo only after a blunt warning 
from the U.S. that refusal would permanently damage the Western 
alliance. 
  The acknowledgement that Britain had bowed to U.S. and 
French 
pressure came as Conservative MPs voiced deep concern that the 
threat of NATO air strikes might draw the West into greater 
military involvement in Bosnia. 
  After a meeting with senior ministers, the MPs said they 
would push for an immediate withdrawal of the 2,500 British 
troops in the former Yugoslav province if the 10-day ultimatum 
brought an escalation in the conflict. 
  But as the government temporarily suspended its aid convoys 
in Bosnia for fear of retaliation by Serbian forces, ministers 
admitted that the choice had been between supporting the NATO 
plan and a damaging rift with the U.S. 
  It is understood that in a telephone call on Wednesday, 
President Bill Clinton warned Mr John Major that if Britain 
blocked the strategy it might seriously undermine the U.S. 
commitment to NATO. Senior ministers said President Clinton had 
made clear that failure to act would strengthen the hand of 
those in Washington arguing for a much faster and bigger 
disengagement of US forces from Europe. 
  A shift in the French position in favour of the air strikes 
also seriously undercut Mr Major's position that such action 
posed too serious a threat to the troops on the ground. France 
has committed more troops than Britain to Bosnia. 
  One senior minister said that in such circumstances it would 
have been "disastrous" for the future of the alliance to oppose 
the ultimatum. 
  Mr Major, whose government was seriously at odds with 
President Clinton over the admission to the U.S. this month of 
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, judged that Britain could 
not afford another damaging breach. Significant tensions still 
remained within the cabinet before the decision to go along with 
the U.S. was taken. 
  The ministers said the cabinet had agreed to the ultimatum 
only after military commanders on the ground said limited use of 
air power was feasible and that the risk to British troops could 
be contained. It was also agreed that if air strikes failed in 
their objective, there would be no further escalation in British 
military involvement. 
  In a Commons statement, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign 
secretary, alluded repeatedly to the tensions within the Western 
alliance when he said there was a need to present a united front 
within NATO. The government had backed the ultimatum because 
"there is a strong British interest in maintaining the strength 
and solidarity of NATO." 
  He also emphasised hopes that the demilitarisation of 
Sarajevo would speed the process towards a political settlement 
in Bosnia. But he admitted: "No one would pretend that this was 
an easy decision." 
  Mr Hurd was joined by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence 
secretary, in an attempt to calm Tory backbench fears at a 
hastily convened meeting last night. The two ministers stressed 
that contingency plans had been made to secure the safety of 
British troops and, if necessary, to withdraw them. 
  The ministers stressed also the advantages of the new U.S. 
commitment to more active involvement in the search for a 
peaceful settlement. Washington had made it clear it is still 
opposed to the involvement of U.S. troops, but British ministers 
hope the Bosnian Moslems will be persuaded that the U.S. can no 
longer be relied on as a "secret ally."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bosnia Needs More"] </F>
  [Text] "The situation for the population continues to be 
dramatic and unacceptable. There should be no doubt about the 
firm determination of NATO and its member nations to act against 
those responsible so that the resolutions of the UN Security 
Council are respected and the suffering brought to an end. In 
this context it is essential that the Bosnian Serbs lift without 
delay the siege of Sarajevo and that the heights around the city 
and the means of access are placed under the control of UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force]." 
  So said the North Atlantic Council (NAC), on August 9 1993. 
A week earlier it had decided "to make immediate preparations 
for undertaking, in the event that the strangulation of Sarajevo 
and other areas continues, ...stronger measures including air 
strikes against those responsible." 
  Six months later, the siege has not been lifted. The heights 
and means of access remain under Bosnian Serb control. The 
"strangulation" of Sarajevo and other areas continues. So did 
the shelling, more or less continuously until, last Saturday [5 
February], one shell landing in a Sarajevo street market brought 
the city's agony back to Western television screens and, 
thereby, jolted NATO into...well, not action exactly, but a new 
meeting and a new ultimatum. 
  "No one should doubt NATO's resolve," says President Bill 
Clinton. On past form that is exactly what one should doubt. 
True, this time there is a precise deadline. The Bosnian Serbs 
have been given 10 days, not to end the siege of Sarajevo but -- 
"with a view to ending it" -- to withdraw, or "regroup and place 
under UNPROFOR control" their heavy weapons located within 20km 
(12.5 miles) of the city centre. After that, such weapons not 
under UNPROFOR control will be "subject to NATO air strikes." 
<H5>  Inhibiting factors </H5>
  No further meeting of the NAC is required, and the "request" 
from the UN secretary-general has already been received -- 
though "close co-ordination" with him, as the person to whom UN 
commanders on the ground are answerable, will still be necessary. 
  Last year, the concern of UN commanders for the safety of 
their troops was one of the main inhibiting factors. Now, it 
seems, that factor has changed sides. General Jean Cot, the 
overall UNPROFOR commander, and General Sir Michael Rose, the 
commander in Bosnia, both favour a tougher line to restore some 
credibility to their mandate. They see air strikes, or at least 
the credible threat of them, as a useful, perhaps even 
essential, element in that strategy. NATO's excuses for not 
acting, if its bluff is called, are running out. 
  One familiar excuse has reappeared, in the shape of strong 
protests from Russia. But Western governments can hardly allow 
good relations with Russia, however desirable in themselves, to 
be their only objective. And Russia, for its part, should 
consider the effect on Western and Moslem public opinion if it 
appears to aid and abet the Serbs in a policy of starvation, 
massacre and conquest. 
<H5>  Maximum Confusion </H5>
  So the Serbs would be unwise to call NATO's bluff, and the 
signs are they are not going to -- at least not directly or 
immediately. They have promised to move their guns and observe a 
ceasefire. But they are masters of prevarication. (Remember 
their symbolic but tactically meaningless withdrawal from Mount 
Igman last August.) It would be altogether in character for 
them to move some weapons, invite UNPROFOR to take "control" of 
others in circumstances which make UN soldiers effectively their 
hostages, and then accuse the Bosnian government either of 
breaking the ceasefire or of concealing some of its own weapons, 
or both, so creating maximum confusion. It is equally likely 
they will increase the pressure elsewhere in Bosnia, most 
obviously on the Canadian garrison at Srebrenica. 
  Relief of the Canadians by a Dutch contingent had been 
proceeding more or less smoothly. It seems incredible that 
NATO's latest decisions make no mention of this, nor of opening 
the airport at Tuzla, the two specific demands made by the NATO 
summit exactly a month ago. If NATO had a strategy in Bosnia it 
should have reiterated these two demands and made them subject 
to the same deadline. The airport at Tuzla, especially, offers 
the only real hope of relief for suffering civilians in central 
Bosnia and thus also the only hope of restoring credibility to 
the entire UN operation -- as the letter on the opposite page, 
from the Oxfam representative there, points out. It is also 
crucial to any strategy for maintaining even part of Bosnia as a 
viable state under government control, which must be the 
centrepiece of all peace plans and mediation efforts. 
  But NATO does not have a strategy. It has only a spasmodic 
reflex of reacting to events under public pressure.

<F P=106> [Richard Norton-Taylor report: "Spy Agencies Put Under Cash </F>
Review"] 
  [Text] The Government has secretly ordered an 
unprecedented review of the activities of MI6 and GCHQ 
[Government Communications Headquarters], the intelligence 
agencies which spend about 700 million pounds a year gathering 
information on foreign targets. 
  The move is disclosed in a confidential letter from Sir John 
Adye, GCHQ's director, to staff at the electronic eavesdropping 
centre, based in Cheltenham. Sir John says the review, into 
Britain's "foreign intelligence requirements and capability," 
will be "thorough and searching." 
  It will be completed in time for this autumn's public 
expenditure battle in Whitehall and its conclusions sent to the 
Permanent Secretaries Committee on the Intelligence Services 
chaired by Sir Robin Butler, the Cabinet Secretary, which 
includes senior officials from the Foreign Office, Ministry of 
Defence, Home Office and Treasury. 
  The Foreign Office said yesterday the review would be 
conducted by Sir Michael Quinlan, former permanent secretary at 
the MoD [Ministry of Defence]. It would not be published. 
  It is clear from the context of Sir John Adye's letter to 
his 
staff that pressure for the review came originally from the 
Treasury. He says that cabinet ministers last year carried out 
a thorough review of all the security and intelligence agencies, 
including MI5 which is responsible for countering terrorism, 
espionage and subversion within Britain. 
  "The Treasury pointed out that spending on intelligence 
since 
1979 had grown faster in real terms than most areas of the 
public service," Sir John discloses. 
  He reveals that GCHQ managed to limit Treasury demands for a 
5 per cent cut each of the next three years in its proposed 
annual budget of 500 million pounds, to between 2 per cent and 4 
per cent. The number of GCHQ civilian staff will be cut from 
6,500 to 6,000. 
  Sir John predicts permanent cuts in the money devoted to 
GCHQ's two main functions -- Sigint, or signals intelligence 
gathered from spy satellites and eavesdropping stations and the 
agency's Community Electronics Security Group which devises ways 
to protect Britain's coded diplomatic and military traffic. 
  MI6 -- officially called the Secret Intelligence Service -- 
gathers intelligence from human sources, including agents 
recruited in foreign countries. It employs about 2,000 staff, 
and its annual budget is officially estimated at 150 million 
pounds. Later this year, it will move into new, 240 million 
pounds, headquarters at Vauxhall Cross, overlooking the river 
Thames in central London. 
  MI5 -- the Security Service -- also has an annual budget of 
about 150 million pounds and employs about 2,000 full-time 
staff. It will shortly move into new 238 million pounds 
headquarters on Millbank, across the river from MI6. 
  It remains unclear whether the new Intelligence and Security 
Committee of MPs and peers proposed in the Intelligence Services 
Bill will be able to see the Quinlan report. Although its role 
will be to "examine the expenditure, administration and policy" 
of the agencies, ministers and the heads of the three agencies 
will have tight control over what information the committee will 
be able to see. 
  The members of the committee will be appointed by the Prime 
Minister after consulting the Leader of the Opposition.

<F P=106> [Article by Helmut Weixler: "Six and One-Half Weeks; The </F>
Nightmare Issue of Agriculture Will Determine Whether Austria 
Becomes an EU Member in 1995, or Not Until 1997"] 
  [Text] The timetable has been set. Several hectic 
ministers' meetings in Brussels in February; a special 
last-minute summit meeting on the political deal; presentation 
of the membership agreements to the European Parliament on 10 
March, naturally at the last minute; heated debates in 
Strassburg, on 4 May voting by members of the European 
Parliament. And already on 6 May, the ceremonial signing of the 
membership agreements in Brussels. Parallel to this, discussion 
by the parliament in Vienna, referendum on 12 June, and 
lickety-split, before you know it, on 1 January 1995 Austria is 
a member of the European Union [EU]. 
  Possible. Probable. But not certain. 
  The feeling of uncertainty is growing over whether the 
negotiators in Brussels will actually win the race against time. 
The enormous delay over the issue of agriculture, the most 
complicated and extensive issue in the game of negotiation 
poker, is causing major headaches. Above all the "obvious 
nonchalance" (a diplomat) of the responsible parties within the 
European Commission, more precisely: among the members of 
Executive Board 6 [GD 6], which is responsible for agricultural 
issues, is giving rise to increased vexation among those who are 
in favor of membership, as well as among the twelve EU member 
states. The Commission still has not presented its position 
papers on a whole list of important issues -- six and one-half 
weeks before the targeted end to the negotiations. The 
Commission's rude reply: "There is already enough material that 
the member states could be studying in the meantime." 
  From the very beginning of the negotiations "GD 6 has 
developed a special talent for presenting its papers late," 
bickers a spokesperson for one EU member state. Even those who 
support membership have been disappointed with the GD 6 
negotiating leadership, which they have kindly described as 
being "headstrong." Austria, for example, was promised a 
statement by June 1993. The first guidelines for negotiations 
over the agriculture issue turned up on 24 November. An internal 
paper from the Foreign Ministry pointed with concern "to a delay 
that will be hard to make up in the negotiating timetable." Up 
until 15 December 1993 the Commission could at least use the 
excuse that its officials were totally occupied with the arduous 
GATT negotiations. But GATT has been over with now for a month 
and a half. 
  Simply in terms of time, things are getting alarmingly 
close. 
That is why the traveling diplomatic corps is now running at 
full speed; the Austrian ministers are seeking direct contact 
with their colleagues in the European capital cities. Two weeks 
ago Minister of Agriculture Franz Fischler met with his German 
colleagues and with EU Commissioner of Agriculture Rene Steichen 
in Berlin; last week Fischler jetted to Rome; this Thursday [28 
January] the speedy Franz is expected in Brussels. 
  In any case, everything must be settled by the final 
deadline 
on 10 March. If by this date the membership agreements have not 
been presented to the European Parliament, meticulously and 
accurately translated into all nine EU languages, then the 
Euro-delegates will not be able to discuss the issue prior to 
the new elections in June. As to what would happen then, there 
are two schools of thought: Some think negotiations would simply 
continue and the newly elected European Parliament would debate 
the membership agreements in the fall. Austria and the 
Scandinavians will become members on 1 July, 1995, or in the 
worst case scenario on 1 January 1996. So what is one year? 
  In contrast, a top official of one member state cautions 
against the psychological effects of a setback: "If all is not 
completed by March the balloon will deflate, then it is quite 
probable that the European Union will turn to the task of 
internal reform, and the next opportunity for membership will 
not arise until 1997 at the earliest." The "open window" would 
be closed. In 1997, Austria would then have to bark at the gate 
of the EU along with reform states like the Czech Republic, 
Poland, or Hungary. 
  Still, the Austrians continue to radiate optimism. "We have 
the political determination to get it done by 1 March, and so 
does the EU," emphasizes Ambassador Manfred Scheich, chief 
negotiator in Brussels. The official in charge, EU Commissioner 
Hans van den Broek, is also pressing for a political tour de 
force. This will require that the major problem of agriculture 
be resolved at least in its basic points. At any rate, it is 
clear that the many technical details cannot be worked out by 10 
March. 
  For this reason, the foreign ministers are planning to clear 
the medium-sized problems out of the way in the form of a first 
negotiating package, at the sixth round of negotiations held on 
7 and 8 February in Brussels. The very large pieces will then be 
available for all types of bartering at a special summit meeting 
announced by the Greek chairman of the European Council, to be 
held on 28 February and 1 March, or more probably on 7-8 March. 
  The coalition is counting on a successful EU finish. Last 
week a governmental summit in Parliament, chaired by Federal 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Erich Busek, 
plotted the course heading toward the finish line (see table). 
The domestic policy timetable is already set in its broad 
outlines. As early as 15 March the Council of Ministers will 
submit the membership agreements to the Parliament. At the end 
of April, Minister of the Interior Franz Loeschnak will announce 
the referendum to be held on 12 June. 
  Just as the outcome of the negotiations is being sold to the 
people, people are busy racking their brains at the Austrian 
Foreign Ministry over this referendum. A paper from the 
undersecretary for Europe promises that already in the coming 
week, "Demner and Merlicek and Publico will be completing their 
plans for the heated phase prior to the referendum." 
  If it actually comes to this phase. Because not only could 
the ship, heading on a course toward Brussels, still be smashed 
on the reefs of agriculture, secondary residences, and transit, 
which can be seen at a great distance--there is also the danger 
of running aground on several dangerous shoals. That is why up 
to now both sides of the negotiations have most painstakingly 
avoided broaching the subject of a "budget." Still, all are 
awaiting tensely the day when the southern states will present 
their demands with which they will allow their wealthy northern 
cousins to buy their acceptance of club membership. "The longer 
Spain, Portugal, and Greece wait, the more expensive it 
becomes," speculates one Commission insider. For the poorer 
southern countries this is their last opportunity to get 
anything. The next round of membership negotiations will be 
conducted with the economically ill cousins in East Europe. 
  The course heading toward the end of negotiations is still 
marked with unexpected pitfalls; often negotiations break down 
over trivial matters. For instance, Ambassador Scheich was able 
to conclude only two negotiating matters instead of three last 
Friday. In trade policy the EU suddenly wanted to allow only an 
eight-week transition period in the conversion of the forms for 
certificates of origin; Austria was pushing for at least four 
months. The issue was tabled until the next ambassadors' meeting 
on 3 February. As chief negotiator Scheich said with a sigh: 
"Little by little we will get it done." 
<H5>  [Box, p 17] </H5>
<H5>  The Issues Breaking Down the Negotiations </H5>
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  EU Position: 
  Immediate lifting of border controls, immediate lowering of 
prices for farm products to the European level (on the average 
by 17 percent, for some products by around 40 percent). The 
resulting losses in income experienced by the farmers (8 billion 
shillings) should be compensated for by the finance minister 
over a transition period. Swift opening of the market to EU 
agricultural products. 
  Austrian Position: 
  Adjustment of prices for farm products to EU level within 
seven years. In addition to this, membership equalization quotas 
(BAB), a type of customs duty on imports, should be levied. 
Austria is insisting upon border controls. (Another plan is 
under consideration, however, in which the BAB could be levied 
internally.) Gradual opening up of market to foreign 
agricultural products. 
<H5>  Transit </H5>
  EU Position: 
  With EU membership there will be an increase only in inland 
traffic; the transit agreement would apply only in "ecologically 
sensitive" regions, that is in alpine regions; increasing the 
38-ton limit to 40 tons as is the norm in the EU; no border 
controls for ecology points; expansion of the ecology points 
system to include bilateral trade and Austrian freighters. 
  Austrian Position: 
  Content of the Transit Agreement must be included in full in 
the membership agreement: validity until 31 December 2003 and to 
include the entire territory of the Federal Republic; no 
increase in the 38-ton limit; the expansion of the ecology 
points system to bilateral trade is accepted, its application to 
Austrian freighters is still under discussion; rejection of 
border controls, ecology points should be regulated within the 
country. 
<H5>  Secondary Residences </H5>
  EU Position: 
  Austria may restrict the acquisition of secondary 
residences, 
but only on a strictly nondiscriminatory basis. The Danish model 
(in order to acquire a secondary residence a person must have 
already lived in Austria for five years and/or maintain his or 
her primary residence here) will not be applied to Austria. 
  Austrian Position: 
  Austria has come up with a new proposal for compromise that 
would permit the use of the "Danish model," but only in 
particularly "sensitive" regions. These sensitive regions are 
identified based upon two criteria: the number of secondary 
residences as a percentage of total existing dwellings and the 
scarcity of property for building.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Andreas Khol, foreign policy spokesman of </F>
the Austrian People's Party and executive secretary of the 
European Democratic Union: "Austria Negotiates All Obstacles in 
Its Path"] 
  [Text] Austria applied to join Europe in July 1989 -- at a 
time when the Cold War and the iron curtain still divided the 
continent. It was a logical step for a country which had always 
felt in tune with the goals and objectives of Western 
democracies. 
  Today Austria is on the last lap of an exhausting marathon 
to 
become a full member of the European Union [EU]. Despite some 
remaining pitfalls, the signs are that membership will be won at 
the beginning of 1995. 
  Before then, however, there is much work to be done and time 
is running out. A great deal is at stake and failure would 
result in a serious setback for the EU and the other European 
Free Trade Association applicants. It would also adversely 
affect the hopes of the new democracies of Central and East 
Europe. 
  On the positive side, Austria has negotiated satisfactory 
terms with the EU which allow it to retain its higher 
environmental standards. It is also to continue its antinuclear 
policy. This is especially important to an electorate who, in 
1978, voted against commissioning a nuclear reactor near Vienna. 
  In addition, agreement has been reached on the regional fund 
and relative financial benefits. Arrangements with Japan worth 
62 billion schillings ($5bn) on Austrian-made components in 
imported Japanese cars have also been confirmed. 
  The Austrian interpretation that Maastricht is compatible 
with neutrality has also been accepted. Austria adopted 
permanent neutrality in a constitutional law passed by 
parliament in 1955. 
  This means it will never accede to military alliances, nor 
permit the establishment of foreign military bases on her 
territory. 
  Most Austrians associate neutral status with peace, 
stability 
and prosperity. With the end of the Cold War, neutrality cannot 
have the same meaning as in the past, nor offer the same 
guarantees of security for the future. 
  With the prospect of increasing regional and ethnic 
conflicts 
Austria's position is more vulnerable than ever. Its security 
can be found only within the framework of a common policy with 
the European Union. 
  As regards EU membership, Austria will agree to join the 
Western European Union [WEU] as an observer. It is keen to 
develop comprehensive security arrangements emerging out of the 
EU, WEU, NATO and CSCE. Austria intends to make a full 
contribution and to show solidarity with its partners. 
  Despite this progress, some hard-core issues are yet to be 
settled. The most delicate of these relate to agriculture, 
secondary residences and transit traffic. 
  Several problems remain. Does the internal market come into 
effect immediately on entry or will Austrian produce and markets 
be granted a transitional period? The government is pushing for 
a transition of four years because there are adaptation problems 
for many farmers who would go to the wall, or have to be 
supported by generous subsidies. The question is whether the EU 
would be prepared to share the burden. Austria will be a net 
contributor to EU coffers and a suitable arrangement seems 
likely. 
  The second agricultural problem concerns quotas for future 
Austrian production in the Union, namely beef, milk, sugar, 
pork, wine, wheat and other agricultural products. On this the 
EU has so far failed to make a satisfactory offer. A solution 
will probably be found. 
  On the delicate issue of transit traffic, the EU must agree 
to continue with the present valid agreement. Secondary 
residences is more a psychological than an economic or political 
question. Here one has to respect the Alpine people's wishes 
not to be submerged or destroyed by rich city people. 
  These last points are essential preconditions if the 
government is to go ahead with a referendum, which could take 
place on 12 June. Austria is prepared to negotiate beyond the 
March deadline and even into the autumn to achieve the best deal 
for its farmers and the Tyroleans. This is vital not only for 
their well-being but also for a positive outcome to the 
referendum. If the coalition government of Social Democrats and 
Christian Democrats feels its conditions have not been met and 
the referendum is likely to go against membership, it would 
prefer to wait. Much hinges on Austria, because then Sweden and 
Finland would be unable to organise their own referendums. 
  Austrian negotiators, however, are optimistic all will work 
out on the day. Polls show a consistent, albeit narrow, pro-EU 
majority. They show that Europe is now seen as the most 
important Austrian issue -- above immigration, jobs and 
terrorism. 
  Pundits are predicting a 55 per cent majority in favour of 
Europe, but many voters are still undecided and the government 
cannot count its chickens before they hatch. The small Green 
Party is divided, but opposed to Maastricht. Joerg Haider's 
Freedom Party is difficult to assess. The new Liberal Party is 
pro-European. 
  Come 28 February, exhausted negotiators will sign an 
agreement with the EU. It is inconceivable that this will 
falter over 50,000 tonnes of milk, or six or nine years for 
transit traffic, or Ecu50 million more or less of subsidies. 
After June, Austria can look forward to becoming a full member 
of a united Europe -- which is where it has always belonged.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Peter Rabl and </F>
Hans Rauscher; place and date not given: "Brussels Will Make 
Concessions on Tough Positions"] 
  [Text] [KURIER] We have actually less than one month for 
the decisive negotiations with the European Union [EU]. Will we 
achieve an acceptable agreement or will our entry be delayed? 
  [Vranitzky] Against the background of so many conflicting 
reports, people tend to ignore one thing, namely that this is a 
poker game. As in all poker-like negotiations, the parties 
start out with their maximum demands, for example the European 
Union's position contained in the agricultural paper is, of 
course, an extreme position that could never become reality. 
  [KURIER] So you are sure that Brussels will make concessions 
on some of the tough positions it confronted us with in the 
spheres of agriculture and transit? 
  [Vranitzky] Yes. And I know that from my experience. Four 
years ago, when we worked out the transit agreement, there were 
many people in the European Union and also in Austria who said 
that such an agreement is impossible -- while now we have such 
an agreement. A few days ago, we could hear that a duration of 
only three years could be conceded, while during the visit of 
the German transport minister yesterday, the position sounds 
different again. 
  [KURIER] If the European Union were to commit itself to 
achieving a 60 percent reduction in exhausts, would we be ready 
to compromise and not insist on the full duration of the transit 
agreement? 
  [Vranitzky] We want to bring to fruit efforts that improve 
the transport situation and the ecological situation. 
  [KURIER] But there are serious voices that ask whether the 
transit agreement has really brought a significant reduction of 
exhausts in Austria? 
  [Vranitzky] One effect is that trucks have been modernized. 
  [KURIER] But the second effect is also that foreign trucks 
have increased their loads and forwarding agents are putting up 
with higher fines. 
  [Vranitzky] We must not neglect the awareness that has also 
increased in our neighboring countries. We have received 
signals from Germany: Do not give up your position on the 
transit agreement, because it is a model for other European 
regions, too. After all, we must not forget East-West transit. 
  [KURIER] According to all recent surveys, people are taking 
incredible interest in the European Union at the moment. The 
point now should be to convince the population of the European 
Union not only with facts, but also on the emotional level. 
What is your answer to a primitive argument such as that 
unemployment is much higher in the European Union than in 
Austria, and that if we join, unemployment will go up here, as 
well. 
  [Vranitzky] First, the reason that unemployment is lower in 
Austria is that the quality of our products and the hard work of 
our economy enable us to sell our products to these 12 
countries. Second, these countries are continuously moving 
closer together. So, if we remain outside, it is obvious that 
our exports to the EU will become more and more difficult and, 
thus, also the protection of our jobs. Third, even today we 
suffer from being outside. These disadvantages would increase. 
  [KURIER] Industry has said it would leave the country unless 
we join the European Union. 
  [Vranitzky] Not everybody will emigrate, but one has to take 
such threats very seriously. I have always warned against 
looking at the issue solely from the current point of view. 
Between February and July 1994, no spectacular changes will 
take place. Yet, what will we tell the workers and employees 
five years from now, when many investments in industry will not 
have taken place? 
  [KURIER] You have been criticized for the statement that 
Austria is seeking EU membership without if's and but's. 
  [Vranitzky] My point was to document that this is a vital 
issue for our country. Still, without if's and but's does not 
mean giving up one's positions in the negotiations. 
  [KURIER] Another argument against is: The significant 
economic decline in 1993, unemployment, farmers' demonstrations, 
the job action in the German metal industry -- that is the 
European Union; should we really join it? 
  [Vranitzky] Or even more strongly: The European Union cannot 
solve the Yugoslavia crisis. Then there are the monetary 
turbulences, the fall in stock exchange prices. Particularly 
because a second Yugoslavia must be prevented, one has to 
support the political network. Particularly because hundreds of 
millions [no currency specified] have been lost, one needs to 
coordinate monetary policy. 
  [KURIER] What would you tell the Austrians in a single 
headline on the current situation in the EU discussion? A 
one-sentence message. 
  [Vranitzky] That is not easy. What the opponents of the 
European Union are trying to convince the people of is the 
threatening loss of identity, the being mixed into an 
all-European mash. Yet, the exact opposite is true; 
particularly because we want to preserve our independence, 
particularly because we want to maintain our character as a 
small, efficient people at a sensible border line, we must not 
remain isolated when others embark on a joint course. Brussels 
headquarters has existed for 35 years. Yet, not a single 
citizen of Wuppertal has turned into a Belgian. 
  [KURIER] Another argument brought forth by many is that 
Germany dominates the European Union, and that accession would 
be a second Anschluss. 
  [Vranitzky] In reality, we would become more dependent on 
Germany if we remained outside. 
  [KURIER] We have another month. Can we do it or not? 
  [Vranitzky] You want an answer to be published in your 
newspaper or a private answer? 
  [KURIER] First for the newspaper, and then a private one. 
  [Vranitzky] I am giving you one answer for both, and it is: 
yes.

<F P=106> [APA report: "Austrian Companies Concentrate on East </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Austrian companies have increased 
massively their investments in East Europe. According to a 
study by the Economic Research Institute (Wifo), Austrian 
expenditures on projects in the East were even higher than 
investments in the European Union. 
  Thus, the Austrians invested 3 billion schillings in the 
reform states in the first half of 1993 but only 2.7 billion in 
the European Union. 
  Of Austria's total foreign investment of 59 billion 
schillings, about 25 percent went to East Europe. In 1990 the 
share was 10 percent. 
  A total of 50 percent of direct Austrian investments abroad 
were made in the European Union, with Germany topping the list 
at 20 percent. The share of investments is 9 percent in the 
European Free Trade Association [EFTA] and 12 percent in the 
United States. Since 1989, investments in the EFTA countries 
have dropped by 50 percent. 
  The significance of Austrian investments is generally 
increasing. They rose from 1.3 to 3 billion schillings in the 
first half of the 1980's to 11 billion schillings in 1989. In 
1992 they reached a level of 21.5 billion schillings. According 
to the Wifo analysis, a decline occurred in 1993 because of the 
bad economic situation. 
  Whereas the activities of Austrian companies abroad have 
increased strongly, the nation's attractiveness for foreign 
investors has declined. In the 1970's, a total of 0.8 percent 
of all foreign investments by OECD states were made in Austria; 
in the 1980's the share dropped to 0.4 percent. 
  The Wifo cited the pending decision on Austrian membership 
in 
the European Union as the major reason. Thus, Austria was not 
able to participate in the investment boom in West Europe before 
the introduction of the single market. 
  Overall investments by foreign companies in Austria are 
currently standing at 69 billion schillings. About 60 percent 
of the money comes from European Union states, with Germany 
accounting for two-thirds. 
  EFTA states accounted for 20 percent of the investments, and 
the United States 7 to 8 percent. Direct investments by Eastern 
states (2 percent) are insignificant. The remaining 10 percent 
were invested by Japanese companies.

<F P=106> [Paul De Bruyn commentary: "Price of Short-Sighted Policies </F>
and Lack of Courage"] 
  [Text] Since NATO issued the ultimatum against the Serbs, 
which had become inevitable, an international political 
situation has arisen which shows parallels with the one just 
prior the Gulf war. Then, too, the world counted down the time 
to the moment when the deadline would expire, and then, too, the 
deadline led to increased diplomatic activity to try to avoid a 
fatal explosion. 
  For the time being most Western governments are assuming 
that 
military action will not be necessary. They are counting on the 
Serbs and the Bosnian Government Army to hand over their heavy 
weapons to the United Nations within the deadline. Such 
positions show again -- in so far as that was still necessary -- 
that no one is burning to really intervene. That is the big 
difference with the Gulf war. Then, Western leaders were 
determined to join battle with Saddam Husayn, no matter what the 
consequences. The Bosnian tragedy soon will have unfurled 
itself before everyone for two years and no one has ever shown 
the same determination. Despite the far more serious human 
rights violations, the bloodbaths, the "ethnic cleansing," the 
destruction of everything a Western democracy claims it believes 
in, no Western leader has ever taken action to make it clear 
that enough was enough. That is not simply linked to a painful 
lack of courage, but has just as much to do with a lack of 
strategy. 
  The truth, which no one likes to hear, is that this crisis 
has demonstrated the limits of the West's power and 
possibilities in the most painful way. The West has allowed 
itself to be dragged into a swamp from which it was impossible 
to escape. The only way out of the policies followed up to now 
is ever greater involvement at an ever higher cost, with 
diminishing chances of a real solution. It is strange to hear 
Foreign Minister Willy Claes now admit this. Even at the time 
of the Bosnia conference in London in August 1992, everyone who 
had followed the crisis could unerringly predict this scenario. 
  By carrying out air strikes against Serb positions, NATO 
hopes to break through this spiral. And much is at stake for 
the organization. The Western military alliance also shares the 
impotence of the European Union and the United Nations. What it 
comes down to for NATO is restoring its credibility. Air 
strikes may achieve this goal, but they will contribute nothing 
to the real goal, namely a just solution to the crisis. 
  The idea underlying the NATO threat is that the Bosnian 
Government will be forced to agree to the division of the 
country. If the Serbs give up their siege of Sarajevo, they will 
be able to negotiate from the strongest position. They will no 
longer have to fear attack and therefore will be rewarded for 
their aggression. The Bosnian Government could then do nothing 
else but give in. If it did not do so, then it would isolate 
itself. Indeed, then the victims of the war would be regarded 
as an obstacle on the way to peace. 
  As NATO understands, its air strikes provide no guarantee 
that the Serbs will not restart the struggle or that they will 
not move it to Tuzla or Srebenica or another safe area. Nor are 
they any guarantee that the crisis will not break out in Kosovo, 
where a time bomb has been ticking away for a long time. 
  NATO, the EU, and the United Nations are now in the 
situation 
where no intervention of any kind will provide any kind of 
solution. Air strikes are no way out, but no one could bear to 
look on any further, and no one wants to send even more UN 
troops into a hopeless situation. Everyone is now learning the 
bitter lesson that the chances which were lost right at the 
beginning are now taking a huge revenge. By intervening 
earlier, the Serbs could have been curbed, the parties could 
have been forced to negotiate seriously, and thousands of people 
could have been saved. The West is now paying a high price in 
Bosnia for its lack of courage and short-sighted policies. And 
everyone fears that the price has not yet been paid in full.

<F P=106> [Johan Cuppens commentary: "Failure of Trade Talks Has Wider </F>
Implications"] 
  [Text] The U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Japanese 
guest Morihiro Hosokawa did not mince words. The trade talks 
between the two countries had failed. Period. That was it. 
There were no veiled declarations to give the impression that 
the failure was less radical and brutal than it appears. They 
would rather have no agreement than yet another bad compromise 
whose negative consequences would only come to light later, to 
everybody's disadvantage. 
  Trade disputes are not an exceptional phenomenon. However, 
it is something else if the numbers one and two of the world 
economy are seen fighting in public. And the fact that no 
attempt was made to obscure the disagreement indicates that far 
more is at stake than a dispute over a few percentage points in 
import or export quotas. The dispute marks a not unimportant 
shift in the relationship between Washington and Tokyo. It has 
escaped no one's notice that the U.S. Government has taken a 
more assertive attitude and is being consistent in its policy 
since the election of President Clinton. This attitude is helped 
by the economic recovery now taking place in the United States. 
  Clinton's predecessors, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, also 
paid attention to U.S. trading interests, but avoided such open 
confrontation. The scene when President Bush fainted in January 
1992 during an official banquet in Tokyo is still fresh in the 
memory. At the time, Bush was in the wake of leading 
businessmen seeking to beg a greater share in the Japanese car 
and car-component market. The collapse was felt to be virtually 
symptomatic of the United States's lack of decisiveness toward 
Japan in that period. Back then possible differences in opinion 
were traditionally brushed under the carpet at the last minute 
with hastily cobbled-together compromises which were 
sufficiently unclear to allow everyone to save face. Just as 
traditionally, the explanation of such agreements given by both 
parties differed, which gave rise to new tensions. 
  President Clinton is playing a more open and much harder 
game. He is demanding cast-iron guarantees rather than vague 
promises which produce nothing in the end. Since 1980 the 
United States and Japan have made no less than 29 agreements to 
settle bilateral trade disputes. Most of them remained dead 
letters and did nothing to prevent the Japanese trade surplus 
with the United States increasing to $50 billion last year. 
  The international context also offers President Clinton more 
room for maneuver. The end of the Cold War means that the U.S. 
President can concentrate his attention on other domains rather 
than pure security objectives. It has now been shown that he is 
not afraid of confrontation with Japan in this new approach. 
Some were assuming that the U.S. President would do everything 
possible to stay good friends with Japan, because they have 
geographical frontline positions with North Korea. The chill in 
relations between Washington and Tokyo comes at the very time 
when both capitals are keeping a close eye on North Korea's 
attempts to become a nuclear power. The hard attitude of the 
United States toward Japan indicates that Washington attaches 
more importance to its national industry than to spotless 
relations with an ally in its policies on North Korea. 
  In this sense it is obvious that the failure of the trade 
talks between the United States and Japan has far wider 
implications than simple trade policies.

<F P=106> [Jonathan Eyal commentary: "A Union Without East Europe Is </F>
Not European"] 
  [Text] At his recent annual meeting with foreign 
correspondents in Brussels, European Commission President 
Jacques Delors reminded his audience that Warsaw and Budapest 
are just as much "poles of European culture" as Brussels, 
Amsterdam, or London. With his call for a rapid enlargement of 
the European Union [EU] toward the East, Delors took a very 
large step. Ironically enough his call sounded with the echo of 
Margaret Thatcher's appeal in her famous Bruges speech. The 
great champion of European federalism and his most important 
opponent are now strangely in agreement: The former communist 
countries of East Europe must be included in the European 
structures and the Union must play an important role in this 
respect. 
  Since the fall of communism the "integration" of East Europe 
has been an objective which is ritually professed at every 
European meeting and then in practice just as ritually ignored. 
The former communist countries could not of course stand up to 
competition from highly industrialized economies. For this 
reason these countries were offered association treaties which 
ostensibly arranged their phased membership into the EU, but in 
reality said nothing about the criteria for full membership and 
a timetable. 
  The argument that these treaties were the best possible was 
dangerous, precisely because it appeared so reasonable. East 
European countries wanting to join the Union under conditions 
approaching the current economic convergence criteria would have 
to double their gross national product before the end of the 
century. But, because a large part of the capital stock in these 
countries is worthless, sustainable growth would require foreign 
investments of some $100 billion per year until the year 2,000. 
Everyone knows that this is out of the question. The present 
inequality in welfare between East and West cannot be bridged in 
such a short time. At the same time both Portugal and Spain, 
despite 10 years of full Union membership and high investment 
levels, are still relatively poor. Therefore the membership 
decision is a political question which does not rest solely on 
economic indicators. But just as Portugal and Spain were able 
to develop better inside rather than outside the Union, so could 
the East European countries. 
  Ever since it was established, the EU has been based on the 
assumption that closer economic links will lead eventually to 
more political cooperation, which will prevent future wars in 
Europe. The same approach is required for East Europe. This 
whole region is in a sort of hibernation. Rather than having 
governments representing a social contract which has been 
achieved from below, East Europe still has political structures 
and constitutions which are imposed from above, and leaders who 
are determined to instill their people with democratic 
principles. Barring a few exceptions, the first generation of 
postcommunist leaders is rightly convinced of the mission which 
Europe can fulfill. If their efforts remain fruitless, then 
eventually these leaders will probably be replaced by more 
sinister politicians. 
  This logic has never got through to Brussels. The East 
Europeans, rather than being warmly welcomed in West Europe, 
received a full broadside of protectionist self-interest. In 
the short term East Europe's agricultural products are its 
strongest export sector. As a European cereals producer, Poland 
is second only to France; its potato harvest is as big as the 
whole of the EU's put together. Hungary is an efficient meat 
producer. 
  But the EU, where despite the promised reforms half the 
budget still goes on the common agricultural policy, was not 
prepared to allow the East Europeans to sell their products on 
European markets. France even blocked a compromise proposal 
under which Hungary, in its first year as an associated country, 
would be allowed to export an extra 550 tonnes of beef to the 
Union. Last year, the Union decided to make its trade policies 
more flexible, but they are still restrictive and arbitrary. 
For example, over the last 10 years East Europe halved its 
steel production, while the EU member states increased their 
steel production by 20 percent. Yet the East Europeans are still 
accused of "dumping" their steel on European markets and 
punished with high tariffs. The Western leaders spoke of lofty 
principles and the bureaucrats in Brussels played their quota 
game as before. 
  A cynical game was taking place behind the scenes. After 
the end of the Cold War, France was obsessed with binding the 
German giant into a closely united Europe, and until this goal 
was successfully reached it vetoed the enlargement of the Union. 
The United Kingdom, determined to prevent this, made 
impassioned calls for East European membership, above all to 
weaken cohesion within the Union. Both countries agreed on one 
thing: That the East Europeans themselves played no role. But 
what had not been understood in either Paris or London was that 
the end of years of ideological contradictions threatened all 
European institutions and structures with destruction, both in 
the East and West. A union which calls itself "European" will 
never be able to maintain itself for long as a club of 12 rich 
countries on the western edge of the continent while there are 
wars and social collapse in the surrounding countries. The 
Yugoslav war was the first warning. The return of the 
communists in Poland and increasing unrest in Russia quickly 
followed. 
  But more was necessary to convince some governments that 
enlargement is the only option. France and the United Kingdom 
can still allow themselves some hesitation. But Germany, which 
borders numerous East European countries, cannot. It was 
curious how the more Paris did to tie Germany to the West, the 
more Germany became concerned about the East Europeans. And 
London's appeal on behalf of the East Europeans, no matter how 
seriously it was intended, was not taken seriously for a moment 
as long as the British, while knowing what they wanted to fight 
within the Union, still did not announce their own goals. The 
recent comments by Delors indicate that this impasse will be 
broken quickly. 
  In the meantime, the Union has realized that import levies 
on 
East European goods are unpopular and cannot be maintained in 
the long term. Last year's crazy "meat war," proclaimed for 
"health reason," was a political debacle for Brussels. Delors 
also knows that Germany wants to use its Union presidency -- in 
the second half of this war -- to bring about enlargement. And 
finally it has got through to the Brussels bureaucrats that 
after a painful fight to ratify the Maastricht Treaty and the 
endless discussions on monetary union, all Europeans now need a 
popular, comprehensible goal. The reconstruction of the 
continent by removing the old dividing lines between East and 
West meets these needs. 
  Enough problems remain. Six associated East European 
countries could not join the Union overnight. Constitutional 
changes to the Union's voting procedures and a new division of 
subsidies and resources would be necessary. Long and difficult 
debates are ahead, but the time is ripe, because in 1996 the 
Union must in any case discuss its constitutional structures. 
By acknowledging now that enlargement is inevitable in the long 
term, Jacques Delors can have a resounding conclusion to his 
presidency. His successor will then have to take care of the 
heavy work. And if the new president were to be Dutch, then the 
dream of the founders of the European Community would be 
completely realized: A European from a relatively small but old 
democracy would welcome other small but young democracies to the 
family of peaceful European nations -- not from charity, but 
because this is the essence of a truly unified Europe.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Erich Reyhl: "William Tell in the GATT"] </F>
  [Text] A few snags of the GATT agreement of 15 December 
1993 have shown up faster than expected. What has contributed 
to it are the massive attempts by the Americans to threaten and 
exert pressure on the Japanese in terms of economic and trade 
policy. However, according to the result of a first examination 
of the legal situation, the methods applied by the Americans 
seem to be legal, even under the new accords of the Uruguay 
Round and the rules of the new World Trade Organization, WTO. 
Still, what is not unlawful may still be unwise. The U.S. 
position might destroy the main illusion of the eight-year GATT 
negotiations, namely that the law of the jungle will be replaced 
by a proper law once the GATT agreement comes into force in 1995 
and that a "peace order" will begin to rule trade policy. 
  Threats alone and evil words are not banned under the new 
world trade order, not even in an extremely explicit form such 
as the threat with a "trade war" and similar things. What might 
be forbidden, however, could be putting the threat into 
practice, that is to say the action itself. 
  Moreover, negotiators in Geneva were horrified to discover 
that it was particularly the United States that did not accept 
some fundamental former texts of international law on compliance 
with treaties and arbitration decisions or accepted them only 
with reservations. Hence, not even a GATT or WTO decision would 
be absolutely binding or enforceable. 
  These weaknesses and loopholes of the treaty, of course, do 
not mean that one could not act more reasonably and peacefully 
in future practice. This was what everybody was hoping for. 
However, the U.S. policy toward Japan is seen as trend-setting 
and it is far from pointing to the desired direction but to the 
opposite one. This is where the great danger lies. 
  Not enough was quite obviously done in the GATT negotiations 
for conflict prevention and protection against emerging trade 
conflicts. Proof of this lies in the fact that, in the current 
stage of the Japanese-American conflict, the GATT has nothing to 
say. Even the new WTO will not be better prepared. At the most 
the new GATT head, Sutherland, could say a few words of warning 
out of his own responsibility. 
  It is no wonder that Japan is seen as a William Tell by many 
small GATT members, mainly from the Third World, who fights 
against the evil governors. The small GATT countries are 
automatically telling themselves: "What is being done to the 
Japanese can be done to us much more easily. Therefore, we must 
back the Japanese in this case, regardless of whether, 
emotionally, we like it or not." 
  Washington has taken its own desire too much as reality, 
namely that the Japanese are generally and universally seen as 
troublemakers who have the sympathy of nobody and who can, thus, 
be treated roughly. Europe should not make the same mistake.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gerd Zitzelsberger: "Weakness Toward the Yen </F>
Welcome"] 
  [Text] Munich, 15 February -- Two men's quarrel is the 
third man's joy: The Germans are not to blame for the trade 
dispute between the United States and Japan, but rather they 
benefit from it -- at least at the moment. After all, the first 
reaction to the failure of the trade talks was a significant 
revaluation of the yen toward the dollar. At the same time, the 
yen also became much more expensive toward the mark and 
currently rates close to its highest historic level of August 
1993. 
  Last Friday [11 February], a few hours before the talks were 
suspended, 100 yen only cost 1.62 German marks [DM], while on 
Tuesday it was DM1.68; this corresponds to a revaluation of the 
Japanese currency -- or a devaluation of the mark -- by almost 4 
percent. On the basis of the rate at the beginning of the year, 
the changes even amount to 9 percent. 
  The expensive yen first of all means that German companies 
will get more money for their exports to Japan -- calculated on 
the basis of German marks. BMW or Wella can be happy about a 
little extra money; yet, in terms of the national economy, it 
does not make a big difference, since German exports to Japan 
are still a mere trifle. What is important for the economy is 
the effect on imports: Many Japanese products, ranging from 
stereo systems to computer printers and automobiles, are very 
popular here because they simply offer good value for one's 
money. The stronger yen will not force the producers in the Far 
East to increase prices in Germany to get the same money back in 
yen as before. This will make German producers at home more 
competitive. 
  Unlike a strong dollar, an expensive yen hardly creates any 
dangers of inflation, but leads to shifts in market shares -- 
this benefited domestic industry even last year. In addition, 
it improves the competitive position of German companies on 
third markets over contenders from Japan. 
  The high rates of the yen toward the greenback, 
incidentally, 
also has a side effect: It has made the dollar slightly weaker 
toward the mark. This development should actually make it 
easier for the Bundesbank to resume its policy of small steps 
and to cut interests, which are still much too high for the 
current economic developments. 
  One thing that is open, of course, is how long the yen will 
stay so high: Based on the strong economic growth in the United 
States and the rather upward moving interest rates there, 
experts expect the dollar to regain in strength. The price of 
the yen is currently rather a political one than based on 
economic output. 
  Yet, what is also open is how the agreement between the 
United States and Japan, which is bound to come one day, will 
look like: Will the two superpowers reach purely bilateral 
agreements -- in violation of GATT rules -- then Germany and 
Europe will be the losers. Yet, if Japan were to decide to tear 
down some of the many invisible import hurdles, then Clinton 
would have given the Europeans a present.

<F P=106> [Report signed "rmc": "Naumann Asking for Understanding"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow -- "At the moment, NATO is the only working 
defense organization in Europe. It must not be weakened under 
any circumstances." These were the words of the inspector 
general of the Bundeswehr, General Naumann, talking to officers 
of the Moscow General Staff Academy yesterday. 
  He was trying to make his Russian audience appreciate that 
for the Europeans, the alliance is an opportunity to develop a 
"European security and defense identity." The Partnership for 
Peace program initiated by NATO should offer all states outside 
NATO an opportunity for cooperation, including Russia. In 
unmistakably clear words, Naumann said: "It is the NATO of 16 
that decides on admitting new members." In his opinion, Russia 
cannot join. 
  Talking to Russian Chief of Staff Kolesnikov, Naumann got 
the 
impression that the "the NATO Partnership for Peace program is 
viewed increasingly positive." In Naumann's view, the fact that 
the Russian military leadership seems to be taking the West's 
warnings to heart and is thinking of publishing the full text of 
the military doctrine adopted last autumn is almost sensational. 
During the German-Russian General Staff talks scheduled to be 
held in Bonn mid- March, the German side wants to show its 
appreciation for the Russians' openness by affording them 
unrestricted access to the Bundeswehr's secrete defense concept.

<F P=106> [Report signed "hg": "Russia: Finance Minister Wants To </F>
Hold Course"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 11 February -- Russia will stick to 
the reform course even under the current, more difficult 
conditions and will strive for further progress in the 
negotiations on restructuring its old debts. This was indicated 
by Andrey Kasmin, deputy finance minister of the Russian 
Federation, speaking in a series of lectures at the 
Reconstruction Loan Corporation [KfW] in Frankfurt. The main 
goal of the "medium tough" stabilization policy remains the 
further reduction of inflation. There are particular 
expectations from cooperation with Germany; in this connection, 
Kasmin thinks that the relations with the KfW are more effective 
than those with the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development [EBRD] in London. 
  Furthermore, Kasmin did not want to leave unchallenged the 
impression that there is a permanent contradiction between the 
policy of the Finance Ministry and the attitude of the Russian 
Central Bank. In reality, there is now rather sensible 
cooperation at expert level, which is not so much noticed in 
public. This exchange is effective, and the parliamentary 
committee for supervising the central issuing of loans also has 
an influence on the Russian Central Bank. 
  At the moment, however, the problem consists in 
restructuring 
the way the Central Bank is constitutionally anchored. In this 
respect, one must make certain pragmatic concessions during a 
transition period. This also applies to the issuing of loans to 
industry by the Central Bank. Here one has to take into 
consideration the social interrelationships of the large 
industrial and economic institutions. This sets limits for the 
restrictive course in monetary and loan policy. Nevertheless, 
it is necessary to make a really serious start with 
restructuring the real economy in Russia. This is the only way 
to ensure a future for the Russian economy. If one follows a 
tough course, which will logically be painful, one must keep the 
consequences of social dissatisfaction under control. if the 
current path is continued, however, and an uncontrolled influx 
of money permitted, it is possible to predict that Russian 
economy will completely collapse. 
<H5>  For the First Time Saving With Positive Real Interest Rate </H5>
  Last year financial policy certainly made progress, Kasmin 
explained. After all, in December the inflation rate was 
reduced to a monthly rate of 13 percent, which, of course, is 
still extraordinarily high by Western standards. 
  However, one has to set this against the background that 
throughout 1993 the monthly inflation rate was still between 25 
and 30 percent. In addition, the financing of the budget 
deficit has been improved, and during the second half of the 
year it was finally possible to keep a grip on the development 
of the ruble exchange rate. Calculated on the basis of the 
dollar, real wages even increased, and at the end of 1993 it was 
possible to raise the interest rate for savings deposits of 
private individuals to such an extent in nominal terms that, 
compared with December inflation, they even achieved a positive 
real interest. After more than two years of negative interests, 
financial policy certainly has the ambition to bring about a 
general trend toward positive real interests, whereby the main 
goal of financial policy remains the further reduction of 
inflation. The volume of the budget deficit has been brought 
down to a rate below 10 percent of the national product. 
  A certain amount of success was also achieved by means of a 
"medium tough" loan policy. After all, it was possible to limit 
the volume of the global loans controlled by the Central Bank to 
12.8 percent of GNP, compared with 35 percent a year ago. 
However, one has to take into consideration the fact that these 
loans constitute 85 percent of the total loan volume in Russia. 
This shows the weakness of the country's financial and banking 
system. It is important to increase the share of loans issued 
by the commercial banking sector. Corresponding decrees can be 
expected in March. The attempts to establish a financial market 
are also showing the first, encouraging results. It has at 
least been possible to issue state securities for the first time 
-- three- and six-month treasury bills and gold certificates. 
Even though only 3 percent of financial resources are raised 
via these securities, the most important thing is that it has 
been possible to gain credibility for state securities at all. 
Financial policy planning envisages a clear increase of such 
issues for this year, and work is already being done on the 
issuing of medium-term state bonds. After the "child-like 
belief" that every city needs a stock exchange, these 
institutions are not so important at the moment. 
  One must also first wait for the continuation of "coupon 
privatization." The currency exchange gained ground in the end. 
However, the development of the financial markets also requires 
the development of the securities markets. The securities 
dealers have already developed considerable know-how. In the 
end, it is intended to establish a unified securities exchange, 
which permits "real time" trade from Moscow to Vladivostok. 
  In the currency area progress has been achieved by the fact 
that, after the dramatic period of confusion in cash circulation 
as a result of the uncoordinated behavior of 12 central banks, 
it was possible to establish new structures by revitalizing the 
idea of a unified currency area. Above all, it is necessary to 
develop orderly foreign currency markets in other ruble-zone 
countries outside Russia. Russia's foreign currency situation 
has been improved by the decree that 50 percent of foreign 
currency revenues must be put on the market. Kasmin said that 
Russia's foreign assets amount to $4.9 billion. In 1993, gold 
reserves went up from 243 to 305 tonnes. 
<H5>  Passive Bank for East Europe </H5>
  In 1994 further negotiations about agreements with 
international financial institutions are planned. Further loan 
agreements are being prepared with the IMF and the World Bank. 
However, Kasmin's statements indicated disappointment 
concerning cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development in London. The EBRD remains "surprisingly 
passive," Kasmin noted. A total of 16 projects covering an 
overall volume of $1.7 billion are being examined. Relatively 
little has been paid of the promised volume of about $174 
million for the country's oil industry and for further 
infrastructure measures. In any case, the means received are 
clearly below the capital share of $56 million, which Russia has 
had to pay to the EBRD so far. So far, no progress has been 
made at the EBRD regarding the fund for medium-sized industries. 
  All the greater are Russia's expectations concerning 
cooperation with Germany and, in particular, relations with the 
KfW. Kasmin expressly paid tribute to the relations with the 
KfW and to KfW advice. Cooperation with the KfW is more 
effective than with the EBRD. He expressed the expectation that 
the bank for medium-sized industries, which is planned in 
Russia, will be established this year. 
  Increased integration in the discussions and agreements of 
the G-7 is of particular importance for Russia. Having been 
invited to the summit in Naples, Russia can practically be 
considered as the eighth member of this group of industrialized 
nations.

<F P=106> [Report signed "na": "Decrease of Public Share To Be </F>
Yardstick for Financial Policy Decisions"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- In its basic program, to be adopted 
at the fifth all-German party conference between 21 and 23 
February, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] will enlarge its 
policy model of social market economy by an ecological 
dimension. The new basic party program advocates an "ecological 
and social market economy." 
  The party's new basic program will realize and update the 
existing basic program, adopted at the Ludwigshafen party 
conference in 1978. The party conference submission commission 
rejected proposals by the Christian-Social workers and several 
land organizations that had spoken out against expanding the 
term "social market economy" to read "ecological and social 
market economy." The ecological extension of the social market 
economy is one of the most important innovations the basic 
program has seen. 
  The draft program that the delegates have been recommended 
to 
adopt says that the CDU wants to step up the use of market 
economy instruments and control mechanisms in order to achieve a 
more gentle treatment of nature and the environment. The 
objective of the ecological and social market economy is 
combining economy, social justice, and ecology. 
  The CDU considers the principles of polluter and precaution 
the basis of an ecological order. It calls for a system where 
producers and consumers meet the costs resulting from their 
failures in environmental precaution and from using the 
environment. This can only be guaranteed if the costs result in 
honest prices. With this, the CDU wants to stimulate and 
encourage people to be gentle on the environment. 
<H5>  Ecology in Tax Law </H5>
  Based on the individual's responsibility in the ecological 
and social market economy, the CDU speaks out on using all 
cooperation opportunities before implementing government 
regulations. But it leaves no doubt that ecological regulations 
with legal orders and prohibitions, critical values, 
requirements, and licensing procedures are necessary to 
efficiently tackle the immediate danger to humans and the 
environment. 
  But in order to increasingly use industry's efficiency and 
innovativeness to serve the environment, the CDU wants to 
increase the use of ecological control elements in the tax law, 
environmental fees, compensation regulations, and liability 
rules. 
  The CDU basic program also reflects the intensive debate on 
Germany as a business location. The draft program says that as 
a country with a scarce supply of raw materials and high labor 
costs, Germany relies heavily on the efficiency and 
innovativeness of its people and industry. "With our capacity 
to achieve the top results we have to concentrate on top quality 
products and production methods. The cycles of technological 
progress are becoming ever shorter, requiring a speeding up of 
innovations." 
<H5>  Strengthening Business Location Germany </H5>
  For this reason, Germany's competitiveness as a business 
location depends very much on high standards in research and 
development, as well as the use of new technologies such as 
biological and genetic engineering, information and 
environmental technologies. Environment-friendly products and 
technologies will be very important in the future. "By further 
developing our economy to become an ecological and social market 
economy we can both strengthen our leading role in the field of 
environmental technologies and secure an important advantage for 
the future." 
  In order to strengthen Germany standing as a business 
location, the CDU suggests: 
  -- Decreasing the public share and cutting taxes and fees; 
  -- Improving education and vocational training, science and 
research, and its infrastructure; 
  -- Promoting future-oriented technologies and environmental 
protection; 
  -- Privatizing and cutting subsidies; 
  -- Deregulating and decreasing bureaucratic regulations and 
requirements, and speeding up licensing procedures; 
  -- Introducing more flexible working hours and longer 
machine-operating hours; 
  -- Improving information and transport infrastructures; 
  -- In particular, securing social peace and social 
partnership. 
  The program turns against protectionism. It says that 
Germany as an export-oriented industrial nation depends on free 
trade. Protectionism blocks the dynamics of the economy and 
prevents innovation. 
  The consequences of reunification are mainly described in 
the 
basic program's chapters on fiscal and financial policy. These 
chapters say that the framework conditions of financial policy 
changed drastically for a longer period of time following 
reunification. "In order to promote the growing together of 
Germany at a high speed, we have had to put up with higher 
public debts, an increase in the public share, taxes and public 
expenditure for a certain period of time. This must, however, 
be followed by reducing indebtedness, consolidating all public 
households, reducing the public share in the gross national 
product, and easing the tax burden in the medium term." The 
draft says that a reduction of the public share with 
consolidated public households is the yardstick for all fiscal 
policy decisions. 
  The CDU wants to create the conditions for reducing debt by 
redefining public tasks. "We will have to redefine priorities 
in the public services, what the state and social insurance 
systems can do, which public services can be controlled via 
market relations, and which services we will have to cut." The 
CDU considers structural changes and shifts, cuts in spending, 
and higher efficiency necessary. "By deregulating, cutting 
bureaucracy, and privatizing we want to make public services 
more efficient and cost-effective." The CDU wants to increase 
the share of public tasks that are financed by special funds, 
such as prices and fees, and co-insurance. Also, it calls for a 
comprehensive cut in subsidies. Subsidies should be limited in 
time and be digressive. 
  In order to increase clarity and justice, and to simplify 
administration procedures, the CDU wants to link the tax system 
and social benefits that are not based on contributions. 
<H5>  Tax Burden To Be Cut </H5>
  In the medium term, the CDU wants to reduce the overall tax 
burden and restructure the tax system. The draft program says 
that the direct tax burden on productive factors such as capital 
and labor is too high. "We want lower direct tax rates, but a 
broad tax base with less concessions and exemptions." This is, 
at the same time, a simplification, and thus increases tax 
equity. The CDU says that it will have to increase taxes on 
consumption, especially energy consumption and environmental 
fees. "By restructuring the tax system along economic and 
ecological lines, we are setting the course for further 
development of the ecological and social market economy." 
  In terms of taxes, real capital must not be at a 
disadvantage 
in relation to financing capital. The CDU wants to cut 
nonprofit-linked taxes and to speed up the harmonization of 
taxes within the European Union.

<F P=106> [Article by Ulrich Reitz: "The Boss; Wolfgang Schaeuble Has </F>
Done It; The Union Caucus Leader Is His Party's Prime Mover in 
Bonn; His Handicap Does Not Hinder His Ambition"] 
  [Text] One party colleague recently suggested to his 
parliamentary caucus chairman that he resign. "Wolfgang, just 
become president, that will solve the whole problem." 
  Wolfgang Schaeuble let a hasty reply escape his lips: "I 
cannot exactly review the troops from a wheelchair." 
  What is true for the president is also true for the 
chancellor. 
  Protocol-pro Helmut Kohl dismisses the occasional defeatism 
of his most important associate. Whether or not one can review 
troops from a wheelchair is irrelevant. 
  The chancellor sent Schaeuble, the victim of an 
assassination 
attempt, a biography of the paralyzed U.S. President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt. 
  Motto: If you believe in yourself you can do anything. 
  Schaeuble did not read the huge volume and finds the 
comparison with the U.S. president inappropriate. "Roosevelt had 
polio. I had my legs shot out from under me in an instant. The 
two are completely different." 
  But even without Roosevelt's formula, Schaeuble has 
succeeded 
in believing in himself once again. Today he is at the top--the 
one and only union colleague whom Kohl can tolerate having with 
him. And no election chances remain for the ailing chancellor. 
  This tough individual, confined to a wheelchair, has with 
determination maneuvered himself to the top. Government 
administrator, parliamentary caucus leader, CDU strategist: a 
man for all seasons. Kohl's luck has run out and Schaeuble's 
desire for power is increasing. 
  Hermann-Otto Solms, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
parliamentary caucus leader, has a realistic opinion of his 
partner in the coalition: "Chancellor? Yes, he will make it 
there." 
  Schaeuble has this awkward parliamentary group under control 
for the most part. As one member of the executive committee 
recalls, Schaeuble's predecessor, Alfred Dregger, "was Kohl's 
vassal. Schaeuble is his opponent." 
<H5>  The Man Makes Mistakes </H5>
  Once, during a momentary loss of reality, when Schaeuble 
voiced his desire to reduce the sessional expense allowance for 
his deputies, a furor ensued. Developmental politician Volkmar 
Koehler, an unflappable man who had never before lost his 
composure in the parliamentary caucus, was barely able to summon 
the right words: "Mr. Chairman, you have contributed to the 
disparagement of the members of parliament." 
  But Schaeuble's mistakes do not cling to him. And no CDU 
member is able to explain this. They point to the obvious: "He 
is simply the only alternative to Kohl." 
  The fact that his colleagues tend to overlook his mistakes 
also has something to do with the wheelchair. They do not want 
to assail anyone who is already so vulnerable. 
  Parliamentary caucus meeting last Tuesday. The first 
following Christmas break. The 317 representatives are expecting 
encouragement for the big election year. How will we be able to 
pull it out again? Helmut Kohl is gone. 
  And Schaeuble? 
  He says that the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] 
now 
has the opportunity for the first time to come to power, and 
that the feeling of discontent with the coalition is great. 
Schaeuble believes that red-green no longer represents a 
nightmare to many voters. 
  He presents his election campaign plan without emotion--not 
a 
trace of upheaval. The members of parliament had returned to 
Bonn from winter break in a bad humor, many slunk back into 
their offices as if they were boarding a sinking ship. Evenings, 
over wine, they philosophize on the virtues of the opposition. 
  Herbert Werner expressed it in a nutshell: "For 22 years now 
I have sat here in the Bundestag. That was the gloomiest first 
meeting of the year I have ever sat through." 
  The government, with Kohl at its pinnacle, is in the 
basement. And Schaeuble is not pulling it out. Coincidence? 
  For a year now Schaeuble has again been able to drive a car. 
Only now are photographs of this appearing in the press. 
Confidants of the chancellor interpret the message: His handicap 
is no longer an obstacle--to anything. Coincidence? 
  At the end of last week Schaeuble planned to announce to the 
public that in the union's view the economy is picking up. The 
CDU leadership discussed precisely this topic over the weekend. 
Schaeuble, the parliamentary caucus leader, wanted to be faster 
than the party headed by Kohl. His hard luck: His delegates 
remained at variance and the paper was not completed. The 
demonstration of leadership was dropped. 
  Schaeuble speaks loyally of Kohl. Recently, as presidium 
members have noted with amusement, Schaeuble's loyalty has even 
been "a little maliciously euphoric." On Friday he disclosed to 
the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG what the Germans have in Kohl: "a 
treasure." In December this read somewhat differently. At that 
time BILD asked him whether he thought the chancellor would give 
him his job in 1994. 
  His answer: "Because I know Helmut Kohl very well, I know 
that he will put his great responsibility before his own 
opinions." 
  No one has ever used nicer words to say that Kohl has become 
weary of his office. 
  Schaeuble gave an ironic comment regarding newspaper reports 
of a putsch against Kohl: "I will be happy if I am not around 
for that." 
  Michael Glos, CSU [Christian Social Union] land caucus 
leader 
and long-time colleague of Schaeuble, agrees with Kohl-Deputy 
Heinz Eggert: "He is too clever to overthrow the chancellor." 
And Solms knows what Schaeuble is also convinced of: "Only Kohl 
can decide when to leave office. No one can force it." 
  This could change completely following the elections in 
Lower 
Saxony. If the CDU loses more than five percentage points in 10 
weeks, as is feared by union strategists, the debate over the 
chancellor will be opened up. A whole group of parliamentarians 
are planning to call for Kohl's resignation. And they will be 
assisted by a tail wind from CDU land associations. Schaeuble 
has painted himself as an alternative. And then? 
  Today his analysis of the situation remains cool: "The costs 
of a change would be too great." But no one is in a position to 
predict the dynamics of a debate over the chancellor following a 
clear defeat in a key election. 
  If the representatives no longer see any chance of securing 
their own mandate with Kohl, and if they think Schaeuble would 
be their only salvation, then things would look bad for Kohl. 
  Schaeuble has much to thank Kohl for. The chancellor was his 
sponsor, he gave him encouragement in the Reha Hospital in 
Langensteinbach. In terms of their human traits, the two are 
quite close. 
  Already in 1989 Heiner Geissler was speaking with others 
about Kohl's demise. Schaeuble, on the contrary, is not Kohl's 
Brutus. He issues frontal attacks, when they are called for. 
  If he thought the situation was serious enough that the CDU 
was on the verge of being swept down the river, he says, "I 
would discuss it with him." For Schaeuble it is a question of 
loyalty. "Otherwise I would feel like a blackguard." 
  Schaeuble wants to nip in the bud speculation in the union 
that is a threat to him that he is purposefully seeking to 
overthrow Kohl in order to succeed him: "I do not want to become 
chancellor. I want to be spared this bitter cup." 
  Once, in the fall of 1992, Kohl gave Schaeuble (and Volker 
Ruhe) a solemn warning. When the parliamentary caucus chairman, 
together with the east German CDU representatives, was moving 
for the investment loan, thus dragging Kohl into the scrape, 
many in the union considered it an indisputable fact that: 
"Schaeuble is pushing for a grand coalition." Kohl warned, 
hinting at the 1989 putsch: "Anyone who needs it may have a 
Bremen party congress." At that time the party penalized the 
putschists led by Lothar Spaeth. Schaeuble understood. Glos 
describes the consequences: "Schaeuble does not give Kohl an 
opportunity to suggest disloyalty." 
  The shrewd analyst leaves nothing to chance. Certainly not 
his career. This fact is recalled even today by many colleagues. 
  As parliamentary party secretary, Schaeuble exposed the 
weaknesses of Chancellery Minister Philipp Jenninger often 
enough. When Jenninger had to go, the succession went to 
Schaeuble as a matter of course. 
  Then in the chancellery he diligently performed his 
apprentice work in a classic department under the watchful eyes 
of Kohl. 
  In the Interior Ministry Schaeuble early on secured for 
himself the job of handling the number one issue: German unity. 
  "How was it before with the Saarland? Who was in charge 
then?" he quizzed his officials. As was so often the case, 
Schaeuble already knew the answer: It was the minister of the 
interior who organized the reintegration of the Saarland. This 
made the whole thing clear: Chancellery Minister Rudolf Seiters, 
who was actually responsible for the operative Germany policy, 
remained outside. 
  The subtitle of the Schaeuble book The Treaty then 
read "How I negotiated German unity." This irritated Kohl, the 
chancellor of unity, greatly. 
  It is also notable that the representatives who initiated 
the 
demise of the then parliamentary caucus leader Alfred Dregger 
came from Schaeuble's Baden-Wuerttemberg land caucus. After the 
"accident" (Schaeuble seldom refers to it as an assassination 
attempt), Dregger was permitted to extend his stay in office for 
one year, after which he had to yield to Schaeuble. 
  His positions have always been promotions for him--as if 
there were a cuckoo clock for careers. 
  Today Schaeuble is slaving away. Decisions are no longer 
being made in the cabinet, but rather by the party and 
parliamentary caucus leaders in the coalition. Schaeuble is 
maneuvering and pushing. As Glos has noted, "He wants rapid 
results; Kohl is waiting for the wave to die down." 
  Kohl is becoming a statesman, presiding more than governing. 
If things become too close then Schaeuble has to straighten them 
out. 
  For some time now the parliamentary caucus leader has not 
restricted himself to governing. He is looking after the CDU 
image. Schaeuble knows that it is not enough on election day 
merely to present a list of accomplishments from the preceding 
four years. New issues must be addressed--and a clear definition 
of political course must be presented. 
  At the Berlin party congress in September of 1992 Schaeuble 
announced his claim to political and spiritual leadership. He 
possessed key ideas for preventing a drift of disillusioned CDU 
voters toward the right: "national community," "patriotism," 
"fatherland," the state as a "protective community and community 
of destiny," German "normalcy," the family as the center of 
society, the well-armed state--Schaeuble intones Kohl's theme of 
a transition of power from 1982: the spiritual-moral transition. 
  For some time now he has been preparing a strategy for 
making 
the two people's parties again distinguishable. 
  Earlier, Schaeuble checked those who were backing conflict 
as 
a way to improve the CDU image: "If the government can no longer 
function, a clear outline of party policy will be of absolutely 
no use." 
  Those days are gone. Today the parliamentary caucus leader 
quotes the successful election candidate Heiner Geissler: "We 
need to start a fight." If necessary, even in his own camp. 
  That is why it no longer matters if Volker Ruehe criticizes 
Schaeuble's push for the domestic deployment of the Bundeswehr. 
It is more important to the party leader that SPD Party Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping falls into his trap, allowing himself to lose 
his head over a comparison with Spain's fascist dictator Franco. 
  Schaeuble already has the next major issue of conflict up 
his 
sleeve: the privatization of responsibilities of the state. Very 
soon, financing of Germany's expressways will have to come from 
private sources. Citizens will then be required to pay for their 
use. This will provide relief for the budget and will help the 
environment. If the SPD rejects this, Schaeuble plans to hold 
them up as state-minded supporters of a planned economy. 
  Schaeuble, the most effective speaker in parliament, long 
ago 
became the most threatening opponent of the SPD. He speaks more 
softly than he really needs to. He says things that cause the 
opposition to experience a moment of shock before it can catch 
its breath. 
  Kohl for consensus, Schaeuble for upheaval. The 
parliamentary 
caucus leader has assumed Geissler's former role. He is closing 
the gap left by the Adenauer house. 
  This is still true now. Sometimes it becomes a bit too much 
for him. Thus it is considered only logical that he would like 
to again put Geissler up against Scharping. His problem: The 
former general secretary is more devoted to the union than the 
SPD. 
  The SPD continues to plot its course against Schaeuble. 
Parliamentary Secretary Peter Struck's attempt: "He has always 
been somewhere between conservative and reactionary." In 
addition: Schaeuble remained silent during the debate over the 
abortion paragraph 218, and maneuvered for a long time over the 
issue of right to asylum. A rightist? 
  For the strategists, the results are generally more 
important 
than the means. "No good will result if in the end one has a 
clear conscience but has achieved nothing." So he allows the 
aspersions to bounce off of him: "Anyone who considers me a 
rightist must already be rather stupid." 
  Scharping tried a different formula: "This man is driving 
the 
union into a nationalist-rightist corner with his callous 
nature." 
  Callous? Nearly all members of the parliamentary caucus 
leadership have found Schaeuble to be more tolerant, composed, 
and sympathetic since the assassination attempt. The feeling is 
different, however, among those who are not so close to him. 
  Schaeuble will never be a chummy type like Kohl. Beloved in 
public, respected in the parliamentary caucus. With Kohl the 
reverse is true. 
<H5>  Schaeuble Defends Minorities. </H5>
  For example, Friedbert Pflueger. He finds "this new 
stereotype of callousness simply vicious." He says he feels 
"happy and motivated" under Schaeuble's leadership. 
  Schaeuble explains relapses into arrogance with his 
"admittedly somewhat difficult to understand Baden humor." 
  Nonetheless: Schaeuble has risen from superior to chairman. 
Now he may become chancellor. The parade can begin. 
<H5>  [Box, p 20] </H5>
<H5>  Wolfgang Schaeuble on... </H5>
  Rudolf Scharping: A great deal of sympathy for the SPD 
party chairman 
  He is a dangerous opponent, a very good party chairman for 
the SPD in its current condition. He has managed to give the SPD 
confidence. And he has succeeded in conveying to the people the 
idea of a transition in government as something undramatic. He 
does not have a great deal of depth. 
  Hans-Ulrich Klose: Gets along well with the SPD 
parliamentary caucus leader 
  I have a very high opinion of Hans-Ulrich Klose. He is one 
of 
the most intelligent individuals in the German Bundestag, while 
at the same time he is quite human. He worries: Will we be able 
to look ourselves in the eye later when we look back at what we 
have done? I think the same way. 
  Helmut Kohl: Loyal to and friendly with the CDU 
chancellor 
  He has what one needs to be chancellor: a thick skin. No 
other office is exposed to such attacks. And he has no tendency 
toward becoming a potentate, he has remained a relatively normal 
person. And he is a reliable friend--like few others. 
  Wolfgang Schaeuble: Prefers to remain true to himself, 
the CDU parliamentary caucus leader 
  I also hold him in high regard. I am not a split personality 
who is dissatisfied with himself. When one is in the political 
field one must also be a little overconfident, otherwise one 
will not be capable of making decisions. I lie seldom and 
poorly--and I do not like living with an unclean conscience. 
<H5>  [Box, p 22] </H5>
<H5>  Desires and Fears--The Private Wolfgang Schaeuble </H5>
  --Epiphany is marked in red in Wolfgang Schaeuble's 
calendar. 
It was then that he lost a game of chess to his 19-year-old son 
Hans-Joerg for the first time. The perfectionist has a hard time 
dealing with losing. He said his wife is the same: "Ingeborg, 
she is a hopeless case." 
  --Schaeuble has four children and two brothers. He is a 
family man. Even more so after the assassination attempt. "When 
you have had an experience like that, you know how important 
your family is." 
  --There is a ramp in the new Bonn assembly hall. It is too 
steep for wheelchairs. If Schaeuble wants to go to the speaker's 
desk he must go down the ramp. A ride along a perilous 
precipice. If he brakes too sharply with his hands his vehicle 
will tip over. "I will carry this image with me for the rest of 
my days." 
  --Wolfgang Schaeuble admires Vaclav Havel. Not least because 
of his power as a speaker. In September 1991 he visited the 
Czech president. In the Prague castle, however, there was no 
elevator. Only many stairs. And Havel lived upstairs. Upon 
arriving there the union member sighed: "Not my milieu." 
  --From 20 centimeters below the chin upwards there is no 
trace of Schaeuble's disability. He keeps his balance with his 
arms. Two arms are need to play the violin. Schaeuble has taken 
it up. 
  --Schaeuble is supposed to have grown embittered. Saxon 
Heinz 
Eggert, Helmut Kohl's deputy in the CDU party chairmanship, sees 
things differently: "I have seen disabled individuals who have 
comforted the high and mighty."

<F P=106> [Article by Hans-Hermann Kotte and Uli Exner: "Looking for </F>
the Protest Voters--New Parties Trying to Siphon Off Voters 
Between CDU and Republicans"] 
  [Text] Berlin--Former FDP [Free Democratic Party] member 
Manfred Brunner, 46, says he will found his "Association of Free 
Citizens" on 25 January at a "secret location" in western 
Germany and not in the symbol-laden city of Weimar. The protest 
party to the right of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is 
structurally similar to Austria's Free Democratic Party (FPOe) 
with whose head Joerg Haider Brunner will be making appearances 
both in the European and the Bundestag election campaign. 
  On 18 January, the Weimar Hilton canceled the reservations 
for Brunner and his roughly 50 partisans for security reasons. 
In addition, Thuringia's CDU interior minister called the 
Association of Free Citizens "a more dangerous organization than 
the Reps [Republicans] or the NPD [National Democratic Party]" 
and said he would have the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution keep an eye on the proposed Weimar meeting. For his 
part, "National liberal" Brunner who is not only good friends 
with Haider but also with Peter Gauweiler termed this "a 
scandal." 
  The statements by Thuringia's interior minister may well 
turn 
out to provide unintentional campaign assistance by the worried 
CDU/CSU (Christian Social Union) which is getting increasingly 
concerned about the emergence of more and more protest parties. 
After all, both the Association of Free Citizens and other 
right-wing one-man parties depend on media attention and 
"misunderstandings" in the gray area between the "breaking of 
taboos" and maintaining half-hearted distance from the 
right-wing extremists as they try to tap into as many voter 
reservoirs as possible. 
  Brunner is good at neatly packaging his nationalist slogans, 
emphasizing Germany's "median position," saying that he would 
like to see German interests in "Central and East Europe" 
safeguarded, voicing concern about the threats to Germany's 
"equal rights" in the European Union and citing his preference 
for Europe as a "confederation" rather than a "federal state." 
He does not wish to give up the German mark in favor of the ECU 
and tries to tempt the business sector by proposing an 
"unfettered market economy," the abolition of government social 
insurance programs and comprehensive collective bargaining. 
  Brunner also calls for a "normal evaluation of German 
history" as he put it this week in a presentation of his program 
before a discussion group centering on right-wing historians 
Rainer Zitelmann and Ernst Nolte. 
  Brunner, who aims to campaign with his party in the European 
and the Bundestag elections, was fired by the chef de cabinet of 
Chancellor Kohl's EC Commissioner Martin Bangemann in 1992 
because of his opposition to the Maastricht Treaty. After his 
suit against the Treaty before the Constitutional Court was 
quashed, Brunner quit the FDP and initially flirted with joining 
the CSU. Subsequently, the conceited, eloquent orator started 
his own political party. 
  While Brunner is already talking about sharing the podium 
with Joerg Haider (whom he calls a "sensible man"), Czech 
Minister President Vaclav Havel, and Margaret Thatcher at 
campaign rallies, the Association of Free Citizens still lacks a 
broad base. Brunner told DER SPIEGEL that "several thousand 
interested individuals" have come forward. For the time being, 
the Right has adopted a wait-and-see attitude as Brunner's 
appearance in Berlin has demonstrated. The "Euro rebel" is not 
emotional enough and too wishy-washy for former Rep and DVU 
[German People's Union] members while the CDU and right-wing 
liberals are afraid of a further fragmentation of the political 
spectrum. But right-wing and right-wing radical intellectuals 
associated with magazines such as EUROPA VORN [European 
Vanguard] and NATION UND EUROPA [The Nation and Europe] could 
well imagine a German "Haider model." 
  The party's 38-member founding committee includes staunch 
conservatives such as Roland Vaubel, a Mannheim professor of 
economics; Guenter Steckhan, the chief of police of the city of 
Hagen; and Erwin Wickert, the former German ambassador to China. 
Others include Karl Albrecht Schachtschneider, a law professor, 
and Hans Heinrich Rupp, who pleaded Brunner's case before the 
Constitutional Court. 
  Brunner told TAGESZEITUNG that his campaign issues will 
include "internal security" and immigration policy, saying that 
he would like to see the right of asylum "totally abolished" as 
a "subjective right." Immigration is acceptable only, if it is 
"in the specifically German interest," he added. "Germany is not 
a nation of immigrants. One must not overestimate the 
population's potential for integration. Reticence in immigration 
is the prerequisite for a friendly attitude toward foreigners." 
So much for a policy statement of the "Rep-light" variety, as 
Albert Schmid, the SPD caucus chairman in the Bavarian assembly 
has characterized the Brunner party.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] An unattributed article in the 3 
February Paris daily LIBERATION quotes Rally for the Republic 
(RPR) leader Jacques Chirac as stating to Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur that he "approves and supports without reservations the 
government's course of action." Chirac was attempting to quell 
his party's criticism of Balladur on the occasion of the 
announcement of the prime minister's economic stimulation plan. 
Nevertheless, the article contends that, given the presidential 
election timetable, the truce between the two officials is 
"fragile." The following issues may yet rekindle the "polemics" 
between the Chirac and Balladur partisans. 
  Opinions are divided on Bosnia. While Pierre Lellouche, 
Chirac's diplomatic adviser, thinks French troops should be 
withdrawn from the area, others in the RPR advocate armed 
intervention. Balladur's entourage is much more "prudent," for 
the prime minister knows that President Francois Mitterrand is 
reluctant to discuss a withdrawal publicly. 
  On Africa, Chirac opposed the devaluation of the CFA franc 
which, he believes, stands in major contradiction with one of 
the pillars of Gaullist policy and will provoke serious domestic 
troubles in the countries involved. 
  Balladur was careful not to oppose Mitterrand's decision to 
stop nuclear testing to avoid a confrontation with the 
president. However, neo-Gaullists consider nuclear tests a 
symbol of de Gaulle's strategy of deterrence. 
  When Chirac maintained in the past that Balladur's 
government was called upon only to manage cohabitation because 
important reforms could only be enacted after the presidential 
elections, Balladur contradicted him, saying that his government 
was elected to provide a "new breath" for the country. The RPR 
now criticizes Balladur's stimulation plan as "insufficient," 
while the prime minister himself attempts to "put the brakes" on 
any significant reforms to preserve his popularity. According to 
the article, Chirac's "critical" support is designed to show 
that Balladur "is decidedly unable to fill the presidential 
function to which he aspires without saying so." 
  The European Parliament elections are a final bone of 
contention. The prime minister flip-flopped in first agreeing to 
head the list of the majority and then refusing to do so, for 
fear that the elections would turn into a test for the 
government. Similarly, Chirac first agreed to his own candidacy 
and then rejected it when the RPR's partner, the Union for 
French Democracy (UDF), refused to support it. In the end, 
Balladur gave up, affirming that the issue depends on 
negotiations between parties. However, the prime minister is 
aware that the cohesion of his majority, and, hence, the 
presidential race, are at stake.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] A commentary by political analyst Alain 
Duhamel in the 4 February Paris daily LIBERATION focuses on the 
rise of a new political personality on the Left, which he terms 
the "Aubry phenomenon." The "fairly spectacular" emergence of 
former Minister of Labor Martine Aubry, daughter of EC 
Commission President Jacques Delors, proves that the socialist 
label has ceased to be a handicap in the public's view, Duhamel 
contends. In fact, a SOFRES/FIGARO MAGAZINE February poll showed 
that Aubry's popularity jumped 10 percentage points, placing her 
fourth after Delors, former Minister of Culture Jack Lang and PS 
leader Michel Rocard, but ahead of well-known PS officials such 
as Lionel Jospin, Pierre Mauroy, and Laurent Fabius. Additional 
proof that the PS is not quite "condemned to electoral 
banishment" as was believed not too long ago was furnished by 
some respectable scores in the last legislative by-elections, 
Duhamel continues. While Aubry's popularity is undoubtedly due 
to the publication of her recent book--praised by critics and 
the press--and her appearance on a television program that 
highlighted "her natural authority, clarity of expression and 
intellectual agility," her "energy, intelligence, independence, 
and vivacity" are beginning to be well-known. 
  Nonetheless, Aubry's popularity does not stem solely from 
her 
personal attributes, Duhamel contends. It also reflects Rocard's 
present "political stagnation" and the convergence between 
Aubry's political image and the emerging social demands related 
to the "phantom of unemployment and the nightmare of exclusion 
haunting the French" that both the Left and the Right have 
failed to curb. It is well known that Aubry has made these 
issues her "obsession and specialty," Duhamel writes. Moreover, 
the French, "traumatized by the crisis and disappointed by 
political parties" are turning away from ideological and 
partisan politics. Aubry, who has kept her distance from parties 
and the politicians, only arrived on the scene three years ago 
and is untainted by the political maneuvering characterizing her 
fellow politicians. Finally, she also enjoys the advantage of 
being a woman in a field of men, presently the most popular in 
France with the exception of Minister of Social Affairs Simone 
Veil, Duhamel concludes.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The French press recently published a 
number of polls on the presidential and European Parliament 
elections. 
  The 22 January Paris weekly LE POINT published the results 
of an IPSOS/LE POINT poll conducted between 14 and 17 January 
among a representative sample of 1,000 individuals. Respondents 
were asked their presidential candidate preference in the first 
round of voting. Several hypotheses were posed: 
  A race including Michel Rocard, leader of the Socialist 
Party (PS), Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Rally for the 
Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac. The winner was Edouard 
Balladur with 38 percent of the vote, followed by Rocard with 18 
percent and Chirac with 13 percent. Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of 
the extreme right National Front (FN) received 11 percent, the 
candidate of the ecologist movement with 11 percent, the 
candidate of the Communist Party (PC) 7 percent, and the 
candidate of the extreme left 2 percent. Some 23 percent did not 
answer. 
  A race including Rocard, Union for French Democracy (UDF) 
leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and Chirac would be won by 
Chirac with 31 percent, followed by Rocard with 21 percent, and 
Giscard d'Estaing with 15 percent. The candidate of the 
ecologist movement received 14 percent, Le Pen 10 percent, the 
candidate of the PC 7 percent, and the extreme left's candidate 
2 percent. A total of 25 percent did not answer. 
  In a contest including Rocard, Balladur, and Giscard 
d'Estaing the lead would go to Balladur with 42 percent, 
followed by Rocard with 19 percent, the ecologists' candidate 
with 13 percent, Le Pen with 10 percent, Giscard d'Estaing and 
the candidate of the PC with 7 percent, and the candidate of the 
extreme left with 2 percent. Some 21 percent did not answer. 
  In a race between Rocard, Balladur, Chirac, and Senate 
President Rene Monory the winner again would be Balladur with 36 
percent, followed by Rocard with 17 percent, Chirac with 13 
percent, the ecologists' candidate with 12 percent, Le Pen with 
9 percent, the PC's candidate with 7 percent, Rene Monory with 4 
percent, and the extreme left's candidate with 2 percent. A 
total of 21 percent did not answer. 
  The last hypothesis involved a race including Rocard, 
Balladur, Chirac, and Giscard d'Estaing. Balladur would overtake 
all his rivals with 34 percent, followed by Rocard with 19 
percent, Chirac with 14 percent, the ecologists' candidate with 
11 percent, Le Pen with 9 percent, the PC's candidate with 6 
percent, Giscard d'Estaing with 5 percent, and the candidate of 
the extreme left with 2 percent. 
  Commenting on the results, Denis Jeambar notes that "nothing 
can resist Balladur and Chirac": Neither a Rocard "stuck" 
between 17 and 21 percent, nor the right in which the UDF is 
"afflicted with electoral dwarfism." Giscard d'Estaing, he adds, 
risks the "terrible humiliation" of finding himself behind Le 
Pen. Finally, the UDF's Rene Monory made a very poor showing. 
  Jeambar also comments that the rivalry between the poll's 
two strongest candidates, Balladur and Chirac, will become 
increasingly exacerbated. Chirac is preparing for the 
presidential election with his characteristic energy and force; 
while only the real risk of a defeat would prevent him from 
running, this prospect is nonexistent for the moment because of 
Rocard's low scores. Faced with Chirac's power, Balladur 
possesses cunning, another major ingredient in politics, Jeambar 
continues. The prime minister's ability ensures him an 
"exceptional" presidential potential. The war between the two 
men will be "total," Jeambar predicts. Victory will go to 
whoever can supplement his own specific qualities: Were Chirac 
to successfully add cunning to force, he would win, and if 
Balladur can add force to cunning, he would remain 
"irresistible," Jeambar concludes. 
  Philippe Reinhard comments on the results of a SOFRES poll 
(no further information) in the 20 January Paris daily LE 
QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, according to which Balladur would outscore 
Chirac by 10 percentage points, and president of the EC 
Commission Jacques Delors by 13 percentage points. Some 44 
percent of the respondents would like Balladur to be a candidate 
for president, compared with 23 percent who choose Chirac. Poll 
results are making Chirac's entourage "nervous," as they 
indicate that even RPR sympathizers prefer Balladur as a 
candidate (63 percent) over Chirac (34 percent). However, 
Reinhard points out that the Chirac aides' "exasperation" 
propagates the idea that a Chirac/Balladur war has now replaced 
the "eternal" Chirac-Giscard face-off. Tn addition, by 
criticizing "more or less openly" the prime minister's course of 
action and attempting to invoke a "contract" between Balladur 
and Chirac, these same aides are harming their leader. In fact, 
Reinhard contends, Chirac is certainly not eliminated from the 
race, for as long as he seems practically sure of beating 
Rocard, the candidate of the left, "his presidential chances 
remain intact." Finally, Chirac's friends should not prevent him 
from being viewed as a "credible unifying force" in case 
persistent difficulties and insufficient results make a Balladur 
candidacy improbable, Reinhard concludes. 
  Writing in the 24 January LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, Philippe 
Reinhard comments on the results of an TFOP/LE QUOTIDIEN poll 
conducted on 20-21 January among 955 individuals over 18. 
Respondents were asked to express their preference on a possible 
single list of rightist candidates for the European Parliament 
elections. Like a number of recent polls, they confirmed that 
the RPR and within it Edouard Balladur "dominate the political 
game hands down." Balladur led as head of the list with 28 
percent, followed by Chirac with 16 percent, Giscard d'Estaing 
with 12 percent, and a number of other candidates, each with 
less than 10 percent. According to Reinhard, poll results show 
that the European issue is no longer a UDF "specialty." In 
addition, the Balladur government's course of action has 
"dedramatized" the European debate through the "pragmatic" 
management of European issues and GATT, as well as the 
strengthening effect the negotiations had on Community 
solidarity. A second conclusion from the poll results is the 
surprising fact that Balladur is chosen over other candidates in 
spite of his clear indication that he would reject the 
additional burden. This "Balladurian" performance only confirms 
all other poll results favoring him as the presidential 
candidate, Reinhard comments.

<F P=106> [Report signed "m.v.": "Facing Minister Andreatta's Anger"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Italia Uno television's "Open Studio" 
news program is turning into an "open polemic" with Foreign 
Minister Beniamino Andreatta. Replying to a question by a 
female journalist from the network, who had pointed to Italy's 
low foreign policy profile on Bosnia, Andreatta, yesterday 
evening, hit back with a vitriolic response: "For days 'Open 
Studio' has been criticizing us, while we are working in the 
country's interests." Yesterday, on the 1400 [1300 GMT] news, 
it was director Paolo Liguori's turn to counterattack: "After 
days, weeks, instead of casting his anger at the persons 
responsible for the massacre, he took it out on us who given 
evidence of it. We had only mentioned that Italy also was doing 
too little. Now Andreatta wants to cover the past. He is going 
to Sarajevo, along with Prime Minister Ciampi and President 
Scalfaro. Their presence, in these decisive times, can 
dedramatize the situation and favor a solution." 
  Liguori then went on to denounce the contradiction that we 
have recognized Bosnia as an independent sovereign state but do 
not yet have an accredited an ambassador in Sarajevo, "and as a 
result there is no Bosnian ambassador in Rome, with the result 
that the Swiss ambassador has to go down to Bergamo to sign the 
passports of Bosnian refugees in our country." It is also on 
details, which are not minor , that "one has to judge a 
country's commitment." 
  Andreatta, Liguori explained to us after the TV news 
program, 
"in fact provided a mumbled response on the question of 
ambassadorial accreditation, maintaining that one had been 
appointed, but had then resigned. A justification which is not 
valid in international diplomacy." In fact the polemics go back 
to the 10 days during which "Open Studio's" team was away in 
Bosnia. "In Sarajevo," Liguori said, "when we brought President 
Izetbegovic into the studio, we would have liked to have had him 
hooked up with Andreatta in Milan or Rome. He, on the other 
hand, did not turn up, and naturally we said so. Then we 
discovered the case of the ambassador, and we disclosed that 
too." 
  Liguori f state: "We have been to Sarajevo, now the ministry 
is moving. It is important to break the Bosnians' isolation. 
When French President Mitterrand arrived at Sarajevo, this led 
to the opening of the airport, which since then has served for 
humanitarian flights. A whole number of ministers and prime 
ministers have gone to Sarajevo, French, English, Turkish. But 
not us." Nor does the "Open Studio's" director like Andreatta's 
approach toward the Serbs: "It is wrong to vilify a whole 
people. But if the Serbs of Bosnia and Belgrade continue to arm 
and to supply the Bosnian Serbs, they need to be held 
accountable. And it seems to me, unfortunately, that Andreatta 
is using a dangerous tone in his dealings with the Serbs. In 
this war, neutrality is complicity. To indulge in semantics as 
to who fired the grenade in the market is stupid, ridiculous and 
hypocritical, when everyone knows who fired it." Conclusion: 
"Andreatta, go to Sarajevo." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Today at the Quirinale [president's office], 
[Silvio] Berlusconi, the Forza Italia leader, met with President 
Scalfaro for the first time. Scalfaro also met with Italian 
Republican Party [PRI] secretary [Giorgio] La Malfa. 
  Berlusconi told journalists that while his movement was 
viable on its own, out of necessity it was obliged to enter into 
alliances with other parties: i.e. [Umberto] Bossi [Northern 
League], [Gianfranco] Fini [National Alliance-Italian Social 
Movement], and the former Christian Democrats of the Christian 
Democratic Center Party. 
  [Begin Berlusconi recording] Obviously, certain alliances 
can 
result in lost votes. We hope that voters understand, and we 
hope to be able to explain to them that it was in the higher 
interest of the nation that we entered into these alliances, 
along with the need to add to certain lists [of candidates] the 
names of the leaders and protagonists of some movements with 
which we are allied. [sentence as heard]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with media magnate Silvio Berlusconi by reporter </F>
Fabrizio Ferragni, following meeting with President Scalfaro on 
15 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ferragni] Mr. Berlusconi, you had a full hour of 
talks with Scalfaro. About a month and half ago you criticized 
the head of state. Today, after this meeting, is the dispute 
over? 
  [Berlusconi] I believe so. I explained the motives behind 
that statement to the president, but I also told him that I 
found his conduct in these difficult moments of the election 
campaign beyond reproach. 
  [[Ferragni] At the moment the election campaign is very 
vociferous and annoying people. What do you think? 
  [Berlusconi] I agree that is exactly how things are. Above 
all television is showing voters an election campaign of 
personal attacks, people speaking over each other, ambushes and 
traps, and very little in the way of concrete substance. 
  [Ferragni] Until a few days ago you were the chairman of 
Fininvest. Now you are a candidate and a leader. Is everybody 
going to get equal time? 
  [Berlusconi] I believe that the rule of equal time should 
apply -- i.e. giving all politicians and the leaders of the 
various political forces equal time and space. 
  [Ferragni] Do you mean, in journalistic terminology, a kind 
of electoral forum spread over all the TV channels, during this 
difficult and important campaign? 
  [Berlusconi] Yes, according to the criteria used in all 
democracies -- in France and Spain where I am familiar with the 
television system -- and in America, for example, where each 
candidate has the right to a certain amount of air time to 
explain his program. Even when he is face to face with an 
opposing candidate, he has an impartial moderator who is chiefly 
responsible for keeping time, and he answers questions put to 
him by his opponent or by journalists, and he is allotted time 
to complete his arguments and to explain his position and that 
of his party in depth. 
  [Ferragni] You are now -- in the run up to the elections -- 
allied with Bossi and Fini. After the elctions, do you think it 
would be possible to break up the alliance and form a new one? 
  [Berlusconi] No, absolutely not. It is a requirement in 
elections that an important alliance is formed around a program 
with a view to carrying it out after the elections -- otherwise 
there would be no sense in it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia `ideologue' Giuliano Urbani by </F>
Antonio Preziosi in Perugia; date not given: "We Are Stronger 
Than the League and the MSI"-- first paragraph is L'INDIPENDENTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Perugia -- Forza Italia's boat has the wind in its 
sails, and the ideologue in Berlusconi's party, the party's 
"second fiddle," strongly believes in it. He was awarded his 
daily round of applause, this time in Perugia. He discussed 
programs and alliances, and made no secret of his optimism, 
pointing to the results of opinion polls. "Forza Italia's 
success," Urbani enthused, "proves in my mind that there was a 
huge gap in the center of the Italian political landscape." 
  [Preziosi] What about Martinazzoli [Italian Popular Party, 
PPI, secretary]? 
  [Urbani] I hope he finds the role he seems to be looking for 
. Of course electoral trends are little puzzling at the moment. 
  [Preziosi] Your decision to form an alliance with [League 
Secretary Bossi] and [National Alliance coordinator] Fini was 
also a little puzzling. How do you answer such criticism? 
  [Urbani] This is a delicate moment in our country's history. 
I think that in the past few years important changes have taken 
place in the Northern League and the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement -- now National Alliance], as well as in other parties 
and movements. I prefer to encourage these changes rather than 
highlight past mistakes. 
  [Preziosi] The League in the North, the former MSI in the 
South: It looks rather like a pincer. Could this embrace not 
prove lethal for Forza Italia? 
  [Urbani] I would not say so because, judging by the 
electoral trends expressed by the Italian people, we are 
stronger than both of them. I am afraid of other things. 
  [Preziosi] Such as? 
  [Urbani] The immense problems Italy has right now. Of 
course we cannot kid ourselves, after what we have gone through 
in the past two years, that our country will become like 
Britain's Westminster in a matter of a fortnight. I think we 
are all called upon to make our contribution. 
  [Preziosi] At the forthcoming elections for example. 
  [Urbani] This election is an important test, because if we 
end up in the hands of the wrong surgeons, we will draw further 
away from rather than closer to good government. 
  [Preziosi] You are already tipped as one of the future 
Berlusconi government's key ministers. 
  [Urbani] Those are merely journalistic predictions. The 
formation of governments will be decided by votes and majorities.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Fini: `Unitarian 
Federalism? This Can be Discussed'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Guiglia] How does it feel to 
be allied with the person who, in the north, has gone into 
alliance with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi? 
  [Fini] The agreements on the antiprogressive front are on 
two 
levels: first on an electoral basis, like the one we have 
entered into just now with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, and 
then on the level of policy, like the one signed between Forza 
Italia and the Northern League. The National Alliance will be 
putting up its own candidates throughout the north because it 
does not share the League's social egotism and intends to offer 
an alternative to Italians who are against the left and who are 
tired of the fantasies of the center. 
  [Guiglia] According to MSI's [Italian Social Movement] 
Tremaglia, Forza Italia cannot stand on an "anti-Italy" ticket. 
Is he right or wrong? 
  [Fini] The big success which we and Berlusconi will achieve 
in the center-south will be the best guarantee of national unity 
and will make any separatist whims impossible. The agreement 
which Bossi has been forced to make with Forza Italia is a 
"defensive" pact. Without Berlusconi's aid, the League would 
have lost many of its votes. 
  [Guiglia] Would it not have been better to convince 
Berlusconi to present himself in competition, rather than in 
alliance with the League? 
  [Fini] The conditions were not right for this to happen. On 
the other hand, in the proportional vote in the north we will 
each be present in our own candidates: National Alliance, Forza 
Italia, and the League. We will then know who is growing and 
who is getting smaller. 
  [Guiglia] And if by running in the north you contribute to a 
progressive victory, by withholding from Berlusconi and Bossi 
the votes which are decisive for success? 
  [Fini] The Alliance is a national movement, not a southern 
league. Renouncing the possibility of winning in any part of 
Italy would be to betray ourselves. Moreover, Bossi is 
untrustworthy, in particular when it comes to solidarity. 
  [Guiglia] Communists or federalists, who today are the main 
enemies of the right? 
  [Fini] Enemy number one is the old power system, which is 
still in existence, in part masked by a progressive front, and 
in part by the centrist re-edition of Martinazzoli [Italian 
Popular Party, PPI], Segni [Pact for Italy], La Malfa [Italian 
Republican Party], and Amato [Pact for Italy]. A strong 
National Alliance presence in parliament will thwart the danger 
of terminating the silent and nonviolent revolution of recent 
months. 
  [Guiglia] According to Foreign Minister Andreatta, 
Berlusconi 
risks a "Zhirinovskiy effect" by entering into alliance with 
Fini. When will you march on Istria and Dalmatia? 
  [Fini] My judgment on Zhirinovskiy is worse than 
Andreatta's: 
a dangerous madman who is wandering around Europe demanding what 
cannot be demanded, including our Alto Adige region. The 
Alliance's position on the Italian character of places like 
Istria is one of principle and does not present any threat to 
the balance of foreign politics. We are calling for a review, by 
pacific means, of an unjust treaty, which has penalized all 
other borders and rights of the Italian community, which has 
been rooted in these areas for centuries. Do you want to make a 
comparison between the way German-language citizens live in 
Bolzano and Italian ones in Istria? No marches to Rome, not 
even small ones. This is how Andreatta can function in Piazza 
del Gesu [PPI headquarters]. When a foreign minister obeys 
party rather than national interests and dignity, he is not a 
good foreign minister. Berlusconi anyhow does not come into the 
picture here: With him we have an electoral agreement, not an 
agreement on policy. 
  [Guiglia] With Forza Italia you have candidates and even 
symbols in common. Is it not a little hypocritical to talk only 
of an "electoral" entente? 
  [Fini] I do not deny that we share certain commonalities. I 
am referring to the objective of discomforting the left, our 
objection to excess taxation, and the socialism which still 
pollutes public administration. With Forza Italia there is the 
issue of institutions which we could look into in greater depth: 
That is the idea of "macrocommunes" launched by Professor 
Antonio Martino. We also believe that excess centralism is not 
beaten with Bossi's federalism, but with "unitarian" 
decentralization. We need an intermediate body between local 
councils and parliament. Certainly not bankrupt and 
"party-ruled" regions. Could this be the "macrocommunes" which 
Forza Italia has defined? I believe that we can discuss this 
very seriously. 
  [Guiglia] Segni is not excluding the possibility of an 
"institutional" government. And if the Alliance returned to the 
ghetto after 27 March? 
  [Fini] It is the voters who have brought us out of 
isolation. 
It is true that there is the risk of a new clash with the 
progressives. We are already saying no. The League has 
committed itself to an equally clear no. And who can swear that 
it will not be Segni who moves toward the center-right after 
changing positions for the umpteenth time?

<F P=106> [Franco Vernice report: "Bossi: `We Need Berlusconi. He </F>
Will Be the Powder, We Will Be the Fuse"] 
  [Text] Bormio -- This is how, with audacious metaphor, 
[League Secretary] Umberto Bossi, before sitting down at the 
table at a time when he usually goes to bed, put the problem to 
his grassroots supporters who are not exactly jubilant at his 
marriage of convenience with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. 
"We will be the fuse and he will be the powder." Indeed, it is 
an unusual enough marriage: That is clear, since not all the 
grassroots League supporters gladly accept the embrace of the 
smooth TV mogul, nicknamed Cavaliere [the Cavalier], and his 
impeccable squires. The marriage was, however, the only way 
open and perhaps "the lesser of two evils" as Umberto Bossi, in 
his own version of realpolitik said in Bormio: It was the price 
that had to be paid to beat "the communists" and to leave the 
door to government ajar for the League, "slitting the Christian 
Democratic Party's [DC] throat from ear to ear." It was 
precisely to convince his party that Bossi spent a good half of 
his rally in the Alps on Saturday night [12 February] at Alberto 
da Giussano's party on skis, in front of 1,500 fans in jackets 
and apres-ski wear. 
  The League secretary distanced himself slightly from events. 
From the stage, he retold the story of these last few months: 
the lost battle of the municipal elections, the arrest of 
Patelli, caught by "a bomb planted two years ago," the 
preconference meeting at Assago and the unfolding of a strategy 
largely based on [League lower house floor leader] Maroni's 
raids. Maroni had been sent out to negotiate with [Pact for 
Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] 
Martinazzoli's group just to reveal its inalienable social 
democratic nature. In Bormio, Umberto Bossi placed [Judge] Di 
Pietro among the "villains" since he helped support the 
anti-League maneuvering "of the large Italian families" in the 
Patelli case. Now, finally it is the "year of the samurai," the 
year when accounts will be settled for transformations like 
those of [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto 
and Martinazzoli, for whose "plastic surgery we would need 17 
surgeons working together, and maybe even that would not be not 
enough." 
  Yes, this electoral campaign that started with Berlusconi 
entering the race and the arrest of Paolo Berlusconi at almost 
the same time "will spare nobody: They will use every means, 
nobody will be spared, I repeat nobody" Bossi predicted. His 
speech conjured up the image of a whole blaze of "missile 
attacks"; fireworks, while "the problem is to truly change" the 
country. Bossi reasoned that to prevent being isolated the 
League needed a shore "against the pole of statism and 
centralism," Christian Democrats, the left, and [National 
Alliance leader] Fini -- "the fascist Fini" -- it needed a prop 
to even out the road to federalism in both the north and the 
south. He said: "We reckoned on it and we saw in the local 
elections that they can defeat us in the north because it is not 
easy for us to unite the people: We do not have TV access and 
we do not yet have the newspapers." Then his big idea begins to 
take shape: "We must invent a party that is no longer statist, 
no longer centralist, and that perhaps is not yet federalist 
like the League, a party that bridges the gap between the old 
and the new," good enough to present to the south. In short, a 
kind of party omnibus, perhaps a little amphibian, too. Bossi 
finally met with Berlusconi and the TV cameras at Arcore. Bossi 
also commented that it is necessary to "create the reins to 
somehow put the League in the hands of this superintelligent and 
irresistible Cavaliere" to win people over, even south of the Po 
Valley. Thus, when, on the road to Brianza, Berlusconi stepped 
forward "it went so well we did not even go to see the troops." 
  Silvio Berlusconi himself, who "before, went with the old 
regime, like all entrepreneurs," is now ready. "When we saw him 
I said: `This is the container in which we will bear the ruins 
of the DC.'" Berlusconi has now been transformed into a wide 
net. This then "is the reason for the agreement, while the 
League, my friends, is going straight ahead with no turning 
back." This holds true even if, in the south, "Berlusca" is 
with Fini, who wants to land in Milan but must be careful 
"because we will never give you the north, dear Fini." Now, the 
League is ready to govern to "lead the way for change." The 
applause begins but is a little muted. The realpolitik is fine, 
but, for these League diehards the rose-colored Berlusconi still 
looks like an alien come down from a sky that does not resemble 
theirs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Right: Single Symbol in the South"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- A twofold agreement has been reached on the 
right, with separate pacts for the north and the center and 
south. [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is "entering the arena" 
in Rome, while [League Secretary] Bossi "presides" in Milan. 
  From Tuscany northward the League will control 70 percent of 
the single-candidate constituencies of the north (which total 
360 between the lower house and the Senate) and is offering 
Berlusconi and the other allies 30 percent. An exception is 
being made for Lombardy (including Milan), where Forza Italia 
will have 40 percent, taking on the Christian Democratic Center 
(Mastella and Casini), the former Liberals, the former Pact 
members, and the Pannella group. 
  From Tuscany southward, Forza Italia, [National Alliance 
leader] Fini and the alliance that is joining the north agreed 
and signed a parallel and similar accord last night (Berlusconi 
was absent and was represented by the loyal Marcello Dell'Utri). 
It included the fielding of a single symbol in the 
constituencies of central and southern Italy. As expected, 
matters of form have been "salvaged": Berlusconi is represented 
(together with the centrist vestiges of the former five-party 
alliance) throughout Italy. He is strengthened separately in 
the north by Bossi's League and in the south by Fini's National 
Alliance. Silvio Berlusconi run for a single-candidate 
constituency in central Rome and in three proportional 
constituencies in Rome, Naples, and Palermo. 
  The distribution of candidates is gradually taking shape, 
amid disputes and minor agreements. Here are the latest 
developments in detail. 
  Progressive forces -- There have been periods of conflict 
and 
pacifications. Negotiations are resuming in Sicily following 
the dispute between the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and 
Rete. The battle over the distribution of candidates seems to 
have ended, and now "each party at the negotiating table will 
have made some small or major sacrifice on behalf of this 
extraordinary project, without jeopardizing the radicalism we so 
cherish," Rete's Pippo Russo explained. The negotiations 
continued Sunday [13 February]. The issue remains entirely 
unresolved in Tuscany. "Unfortunately we are proceeding with a 
system very similar to the old cronyism, with no renewal and no 
consideration for the quality of the candidates," according to 
the Democratic Alliance's Willer Bordon. "There are too many 
bureaucrats around. If we are not satisfied we will not 
conclude the negotiations regardless of the cost." Amid the 
flurry of ultimatums, there is strong competition for the safest 
constituencies -- often those of the PDS. This is nothing new. 
The Greens' Stefano Apuzzo took issue with the "antireformers" 
who draw up "losing lists of apparatchiks, disreputable faces 
and gray phantom officials, party bureaucrats." The progressive 
forces' negotiations "are carefully planning the defeat of the 
left-wing forces." Enzo Mattina (Socialist Renewal) issued this 
protest after abandoning the Lazio progressive forces grouping, 
and did not rule out "autonomous lists." He described it as a 
matter of "pride and dignity." He challenged the PDS' 
"excessive hegemony, which gives preference to the Social 
Christian group, whose strength and support are still entirely 
unproven," to the detriment of the socialist component. In 
Umbria the negotiations ended with no candidates for the Greens 
and Rete (which failed to secure acceptance for Mario Capanna). 
The following are running under the progressive banner: Walter 
Veltroni, Mauro Agostini, Maria Rita Lorenzetti, Guido De Guidi, 
Carlo Carpinelli, journalists Ferdinando Adornato, Paolo 
Raffaelli, and Giuseppe Giulietti (RAI [state broadcasting 
service] staff union members), Carlo Gubbini, Leonardo Caponi, 
Fabrizio Bracco, and Antonietta Modolo. Representing the 
entertainment industry, director Giuseppe Tornatore (Palermo) 
declined (because of work commitments), while disc jockey 
Jovanotti (Milan) passed up the offer of "an alignment toward 
which I feel well disposed." 
  Center -- [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] 
Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni asked two 
television news reporters to run in Florentine constituencies: 
Federico Scoiano agreed, while Vittorio Citterich remains 
undecided. Producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori is standing as a PPI 
candidate in Florence. The former Liberal attorney Piero Milio 
is running for the Senate in Palermo with the Pact group; he has 
defended not only Bruno Contrada (Sisde [Intelligence and 
Democratic Security Service]) but also Tano Grasso and Boris 
Giuliano's family. 
  Right -- The League will again filed almost all its outgoing 
members of the lower house and the Senate, with a couple of 
exceptions. Bossi is running in Milan (single-candidate 
constituency) and in Lombardy 2 (proportional); [league lower 
house floor leader] Maroni in Varese and Lombardy; and Fassino 
in Turin. Bossi's doctor, Binaghi, is also standing in the same 
city. Forza Italia is fielding Fininvest attorney Vittorio 
Dotti in Milan; criminal lawyer Della Valle in Monza; Ombretta 
Colli (Gaber's wife) in Saronno. Among the Liberals, Minister 
Costa is running in Mondovi, Alfredo Biondi in Genoa, and 
economist Scognamiglio in Milan 3.

<F P=106> ["f.gui." interview with Transportation Minister Raffaele </F>
Costa; place and date not given: "The Bridge Between Bossi and 
Fini"--first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- From [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, 
Secretary] Occhetto to [League Secretary] Bossi it is a chorus 
of "liberal democrats." But for the first time the traditional 
Liberals will not be contesting the 27 March elections. The 
hundreds of symbols registered do not include the PLI's [Italian 
Liberal Party] tricolor. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Can a Liberal really feel ashamed to call 
himself a Liberal, Minister? 
  [Costa] The absence of the party's traditional symbol must 
not be viewed as a renunciation. The PRI [Italian Republican 
Party] and the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] are absent from 
this contest, and so is even the PDS in the single-candidate 
constituencies. However, there is a high degree of liberalism 
among the political forces. The real issue is to move on from 
plans to deeds. I have my doubts about whether this will 
happen. That is why the Liberals are fielding their own 
candidates. Most of us support, and will vote together with, 
the moderate forces. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Zanone and Patuelli have opted for [Pact for 
Italy leader] Segni. What if they prove to have been right? 
  [Costa] Right and wrong are never so clear-cut. However, I 
believe that the choice that I recommended and made is a more 
consistent one -- and not only with regard to my own conscience. 
I am sure that after 27 March we will have a larger 
liberal-democratic parliamentary group than the present one. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Are you running with the aim of governing or 
of 
going into opposition? 
  [Costa] With a great desire to reverse the situation. 
  [IL GIORNALE] To whose detriment? 
  [Costa] I certainly do not intend to wield a big stick, to 
use a metaphor that someone else used recently. My aim is to 
reshuffle the pack, that is, to revise legislation, to 
streamline it, to dissolve all the unnecessary government 
agencies. Major reform is needed after half a century of 
stop-gap measures and bargains. This must end. Whether we win 
or whether the left wins, the important thing is to regenerate 
this country in earnest. 
  [IL GIORNALE] [National Alliance leader] Fini and Bossi are 
not talking, but you are allied to both of them. Is the 
agreement a mere sham? 
  [Costa] I believe in the role of the transitional factor. 
Bossi represents a major novelty, despite certain errors which I 
have consistently challenged. Fini symbolizes an evolution in a 
definitely democratic direction. The fact is that it is the 
Italian people who have a messianic attitude, an excessively 
messianic attitude, with regard to these forces, which are 
perceived as new. I am not burying my head in the sand. Italy 
is tired and is grabbing hold wherever it can. This is why I 
repeat that after 27 March the first thing to do is to open a 
new chapter. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Will Paolo Berlusconi's house arrest earn or 
lose the moderate alignment votes? 
  [Costa] We are experiencing a troubled climate, as a result 
of some serious events, and it is leading to a very low level of 
political debate. I am willing to admit that Paolo Berlusconi's 
arrest is politically equivalent to implicating [PDS Deputy 
Secretary] Massimo D'Alema in the party funding affair. I wish 
the parties could discuss pensions, foreign policy, inflation, 
and relations with the EC. Instead we find ourselves contending 
with a completely tainted campaign atmosphere. The citizens are 
tired of attempts to poison the political and judicial climate, 
scandals for their own sake, gossip, and misinformation. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Which is worse: RAI [Italian Broadcasting 
Corporation] or Fininvest? 
  [Costa] Since I am an ally of Forza Italia, my opinion is 
obviously suspect. But I will not for that reason refrain from 
pointing out that when Fininvest makes a mistake, it does so 
with its own money. RAI is factious even though it uses my 
money. The public propaganda on behalf of the PDS is 
intolerable. I am very disappointed in Locatelli, RAI's 
managing director: If it were up to me, I would never again 
assign him to a post that demands at least some impartiality. I 
had a friend, Paolo Garimberti, an excellent journalist, who is 
now head of Channel 2 news. I have not changed my mind about 
his professionalism, but I would add that his news programs do 
not convince me at all. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Segni has already raised the suggestion of a 
"government of experts to guarantee institutions." Would you be 
a member of it? 
  [Costa] Segni shows a lack of respect toward his voters. 
Perhaps he is realizing that they are turning their backs on 
him. His Pact threatens to prove a sham. I am not convinced by 
labels: I want clear programs and definite options -- either 
this or that. 
  [IL GIORNALE] You flirted with the Republicans' La Malfa 
until the last moment. Are you not afraid that you went too far? 
  [Costa] La Malfa enjoyed sufficient stature to engage in a 
meaningful dialogue. But now the PRI has a great future behind 
it.

  [Excerpt] Rome -- "I'm disgusted," [Democratic Party of the 
Left (PDS) Deputy Secretary] D'Alema said, and, as a matter of 
fact, this disgust at the so-called strategically timed 
investigations is now felt by many within the PDS. The PDS has 
convened jurists and magistrates precisely on the day when the 
issue of "opportune justice" is disrupting the electoral 
campaign. Last Saturday [12 February] [League Secretary] Bossi 
stated very clearly that "it looks as if the magistrature is 
following politics like a shadow. Action is immediately 
followed by reaction." For his part [Center Union leader] 
Alfredo Biondi said: "This is clockwork justice: As soon as 
[Forza Italia leader] Silvio [Berlusconi] stands as a candidate, 
Paolo [Berlusconi] is arrested." [Italian Socialist Party, PSI, 
rebel member] Ugo Intini's remark: "This will be the first 
election to be decided by handcuffs," while on a Fininvest TV 
program, Enrico Mentana said: "The judges should keep silent 
during the 15 days leading to the elections." 
  Berlusconi's arrest, the attack on D'Alema -- is there 
really 
someone issuing notices and warrants of arrest with stopwatch 
precision? Milan chief public prosecutor Borrelli denies this 
categorically: "We are only responding to events, we cannot 
change our pace at will." 
  Justice Minister Giovanni Conso, however, putting in an 
appearance at the PDS convention, uttered carefully worded 
sentences, thus giving rise to doubt: "We must assume, unless 
otherwise demonstrated, that the timing depends on the 
development of the investigations." Unless otherwise 
demonstrated? Why, is Conso in any doubt? No, he said he was 
in no doubt, but he emphasized that it would make no sense for 
the magistrature to keep quiet for a few days, "it would be a 
serious mistake to regard the electoral campaign as a time when 
the state's fundamental activities are interrupted." 
Nevertheless, the minister added, "at sensitive moments the 
risk of interference between political and judicial activities 
increases, and we must therefore appeal for compliance with the 
rules, and appeal to the honesty of the people." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`I Am Coordinator General....'"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Cavaco Silva has disclaimed any responsibility 
in the Health Ministry affair and praised Leonor Beleza's 
courage and honesty. In yesterday evening's interview with TVI, 
the head of government gave his assurance that there are no 
cases of corruption being kept under wraps. He avoided speaking 
about the Totta [Bank]. [passage omitted] 
  Throughout the interview, conducted by journalists Artur 
Albarran of TVI, Jaime Antunes of the SEMANARIO ECONOMICO, and 
Luis Delgado of DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, there were many questions 
which went unanswered, since Cavaco Silva frequently asserted 
that he or his party had formed no opinion on certain matters. 
  One of the matters left unclarified was that of Cavaco 
Silva's possible candidacy for the presidency of the republic. 
  The PSD [Social Democratic Party] leader confined himself to 
repeating that he intends to fulfill his "pledge to the 
Portuguese people until 1995" -- the year of the legislative 
elections -- and will decide only afterward "what to do, 
including returning to academic life." 
  With respect to the current holder of the post, Cavaco 
maintained that he maintains "completely normal relations" with 
Mario Soares, despite the political disagreements in several 
areas, and emphasized the view upheld at the last PSD National 
Council meeting, that his party should help the current 
president to complete his term "with dignity." 
  The revision of the Constitution was also raised by the 
three 
journalists, with Cavaco Silva citing the section on the 
electoral laws as one which, in his opinion, needs improvements. 
  "There should be improvements to the Constitution aimed at a 
better link between the electorate and the elected," he 
asserted, and to this end he suggested the formation of smaller 
constituencies. 
  He also maintained that the electoral laws -- for the 
Assembly of the Republic and for the local authorities -- should 
"facilitate the formation of majorities." In the legislative 
elections, "it should be possible for a party to achieve a 
majority with 39 percent or 40 percent of the votes." 
  He said that "greater effectiveness in municipal 
administration" is necessary, and advocated the candidacy of 
independents and groups of citizens. He did not forget the 
extension to emigrants of the vote for the presidency of the 
republic -- a PSD "banner" over the past few years. 
  Asked about the revision of the president's powers, he 
confined himself to repeating: "My party has not defined a 
stance on that matter." 
  Cavaco also advocated keeping the figure of the minister of 
the republic -- "I believe that he has made an important 
contribution to national cohesion and to championing the 
autonomous regions' interests in the government" -- a statement 
which must not have pleased his party colleagues in the Azores 
and Madeira. 
  The economic balance sheet for 1993 took up part of the 
interview, with Cavaco asserting that economic growth improved 
in the second half of the year, but acknowledging that 
"investment remained very depressed." 
  With respect to the devaluation of the escudo, he said that 
those who advocate it "are advocating unemployment" -- an 
implicit criticism of [Socialist Party Secretary General] 
Antonio Guterres. 
  He recalled that "interest rates fell by 5 percent" last 
year, and added: "I am convinced that they will fall further. 
The essential thing is to maintain our course." 
  "My major concern is unemployment. It is my major priority," 
he stated, before asserting: "I was tremendously disappointed 
not to have achieved social consensus," but he reaffirmed that 
that this was owing to political reasons. 
  The prime minister said little about the Totta case, 
claiming 
that it is a private enterprise, that the government confined 
itself to enacting the privatization law, and that it now rests 
with the courts to establish whether it is being observed. 
  At the end of the interview, there was still time for Cavaco 
to state that in Bosnia "some punitive actions are justified in 
view of the atrocities."

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Following an interview with the London 
FINANCIAL TIMES and another with the Madrid daily ABC, as well 
as a speech at the meeting of the Social Democratic Party's 
(PSD) national council, it seems certain that Prime Minister 
Cavaco Silva will try for the third time to achieve an absolute 
parliamentary majority in 1995 and remain as prime minister, 
writes political analyst Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in the 31 
January Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS. Rebelo de Sousa 
attributes the prime minister's reported decision to the results 
of the municipal elections--which were better than expected--to 
polls indicating that an absolute majority is not impossible, 
and to the signs pointing to economic recovery in Europe. 
Finally, Cavaco's decision may also stem from the availability 
of EU structural funds in time to stimulate the Portuguese 
economy toward the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995. 
  While a third prime ministership for Cavaco Silva will 
please 
some, it will upset others, Rebelo de Sousa comments. First 
among the latter is Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio 
Guterres, whose basic strategy is predicated on the fact that 
the prime minister has set his sights on the presidency, in 
which case Guterres would face an opponent less formidable than 
Cavaco Silva. Guterres must thus "rethink his discourse and 
image" and focus on a few important issues that can withstand 
the test of time until 1995. Minister of Defense Fernando 
Nogueira, the government's No. 2 man, ought to be no less 
concerned than Guterres, Rebelo de Sousa continues. Nogueira has 
worked hard and well and gets most of the credit for the partial 
victory in the municipal elections. In the debate over the 
post-Cavaco Silva era that opened as early as 1992, Nogueira 
emerged as the prime minister's most likely successor, a 
position Rebelo de Sousa thinks would be difficult to maintain 
for another six years. This would lead to the "bitter" 
conclusion that Nogueira's long labors in "creating 
solidarities, fostering fidelity, and patiently managing 
conflicts, careers, and ambitions" will be unrewarded. 
  A third Cavaco term would also make some people happy, 
Rebelo 
de Sousa continues. On the Right, former Prime Minister and 
media magnate Francisco Pinto Balsemao might decide to run for 
the presidency. He would then have to decide whether to run as 
an independent or under the PSD banner. Other candidates might 
be Azores regional President Mota Amaral or Madeira regional 
President Alberto Joao Jardim, intent on escaping "insular 
claustrophobia," or even "virtual" candidate and PSD luminary 
Eurico de Melo. On the Left, "there is the perennial candidate 
to candidate," former President Ramalho Eanes, "if the 
temptation to recoup lost time wins over a serene assessment of 
the situation." Also, Lisbon Mayor and PS luminary Jorge Sampaio 
and universitarian Rui Alarcao, whose candidacy would mean a 
loss for the legal field in Portugal, Rebelo de Sousa concludes. 
  Were Cavaco Silva to run for the presidency, abandoning the 
government before the next legislative elections, President 
Mario Soares would then dissolve the National Assembly, contends 
the 29 January Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, citing a Soares 
"confidante" as the source of the information. The paper quotes 
this source as saying that Soares "will not allow Cavaco Silva 
to do what Margaret Thatcher did in England, letting herself be 
replaced by a John Major whose name, in this case, is Fernando 
Nogueira." The president's scenario, according to EXPRESSO, is 
that the present difficult situation would render unlikely an 
absolute PSD majority, with the prime minister "forced" to 
announce his presidential candidacy at the party's November 
congress.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] President Mario Soares and Prime 
Minister Cavaco Silva "have buried the hatchet," even if the 
length of the truce is yet unknown, writes Fernando Madrinha in 
the 5 February Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO. On the president's side, 
it is being said that "a sort of tacit agreement" has been 
reached to avoid conflicts, Madrinha notes. On the other hand, a 
Cavaco aide is cited as pointing out, with regard to Soares's 
new attitude, that "his words do not always match his deeds." 
While there are indications that cohabitation is going well and 
that "institutional peace is now a fact," no predictions are 
made on whether this is a "short-term truce" or whether it will 
be a "lasting peace" in light of the fact that both sides have 
recognized the impossibility of hurting each other with 
impunity. According to Madrinha, one ought to keep in mind, as a 
motive for the appeasement, that polls repeatedly revealed the 
Portuguese people's dislike for confrontations at the highest 
level. Soares, who is "inexorably marching toward the autumn of 
his active political life," must now take care of his place in 
history, a fact he knows well, Madrinha remarks. The president 
may have decided that tranquil cohabitation will ensure him a 
"glorious exit" from the political scene, he concludes.

  [Text] There are still hopes for a diplomatic solution to 
the siege of Sarajevo. The Spanish prime minister said so this 
morning and the foreign minister as well as the minister of 
defense said so too. [Defense Minister Julian] Garcia Vargas 
came back this afternoon from Paris where he examined the 
situation with his French counterpart. 
  [Correspondent Martinez Durban] Garcia Vargas says that the 
Serbs are slowly but surely withdrawing their artillery from the 
positions they have around Sarajevo. However, the same cannot 
be said about the mortars. All heavy weaponry sites are well 
known so that, if the NATO attack were to go ahead, it would be 
successful. However, the defense minister still believes in a 
diplomatic solution. If on Sunday [20 February] evening the 
conditions set out by NATO have not been fulfilled, the allies 
will not backtrack. 
  [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] Taking into account how far 
we have gone in our decisions, we have to explain to the 
Russians as well as we can what our position is, mainly why we 
think that this has to be done. But we cannot do anything else. 
There is no going back, I think it is no longer possible. [end 
recording] 
  [Durban] The fact that the blue helmets are now taking 
military positions under their control should keep the Bosnian 
Muslims from taking over the positions that have been under Serb 
control until now. According to Garcia Vargas, the security of 
our contingent is guaranteed although there are possible risks, 
the contingent is aware of them and keeps them under control.

  [Text] Thirty-five years later, some 1,500 Spanish citizens 
will receive reparations for the expropriations that took place 
during the Cuban revolution. The sum of 5.3 billion pesetas was 
approved for reparations today. The money will be paid out by 
the Spanish state, which will in turn be paid back by Fidel 
Castro's regime.

  [Text] Hungarian President Arpad Goncz is in Madrid as the 
first Hungarian head of state in our country. Following an 
official reception at the Pardo Palace, Goncz's official 
residence during the visit, the Hungarian president and his wife 
are having lunch with the King and Queen of Spain at the 
Zarzuela Palace. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Cespedes] President Arpad Goncz's visit 
fits in with the Spanish government policy of paying special 
attention to central and eastern Europe and coincides with a 
good period in Spanish-Hungarian relations. These [relations] 
are without problems; trade has increased three-fold over the 
last two years. This is a fact underscored by President Goncz 
recently at [Madrid's] Barajas airport where he said that his 
visit had a strong economic component. 
  [Goncz in Hungarian with superimposed Spanish translation] 
Our political relations are satisfactory and successful but I 
have brought with me a very big delegation--virtually an entire 
army--of businessmen. I hope that thanks to them the economic 
component of this visit will be enhanced. 
  [Cespedes] The trade balance currently favors Spain by five 
billion pesetas, that is a surplus of 153 percent. Spanish 
exports went from 4.8 billion pesetas in 1991 to 14.108 billion 
in 1993. 
  Spanish investment is planned in Hungarian wine companies. 
After the sale of 76 trains, by the Kaf company, there are 
possibilities that the Talgo [Spanish high speed train] will 
link Kiev, Budapest and Vienna. 
  The situation in Bosnia will be an important topic during 
the 
political talks that Arpad Goncz and [Spanish Prime Minister] 
Felipe Gonzalez will hold this afternoon. The Hungarian 
president has said that he hopes that the conflict will be 
solved without having to carry out the heralded air strikes.

  [Text] Strasbourg, Feb 4 (A.A) -- Swiss Interior Minister 
Ruth Dreifuss said on Friday [4 February] that they attached 
importance to relations with Turkey, adding that "we hope Turkey 
will send an ambassador to Bern soon." 
  Last year, diplomatic relations became tense and Ankara and 
Bern drew their ambassadors back upon the outlawed separatist 
terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization's attack 
on Turkish Consulate in Bern. 
  Dreifuss who came to Strasbourg to attend a Council of 
Europe 
ministerial meeting on drugs, speaking to an AA reporter said 
Switzerland was ready to improve bilateral relations with Turkey. 
  Recalling Swiss justice authorities' request for 
investigation on Turkish Consulate in Bern, Dreifuss said 
Turkish Government did not want the investigation to be done and 
drew its ambassador back. 
  Dreifuss defended the idea that it would be more difficult 
to 
put the separatist terrorist organization under control if they 
ban this organization adding that the Swiss Government will 
never allow any terrorist organization to create violence.

<F P=106> [Report by Flemming Rose: "Moscow Wants Danish Leadership </F>
Role"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Moscow wants Denmark to assume a leading 
international role in the field of peacekeeping missions and the 
prevention of armed conflict. 
  Moscow is therefore urging Denmark to take the initiative, 
now that in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council Denmark has 
been entrusted with the task of gathering and exchanging 
information on peacekeeping operations throughout the world. 
  "There must be a leader in the world community in this field 
and we hope that Denmark will take the lead in this work so that 
we succeed in creating new international legal and political 
mechanisms for the resolution of conflicts and the 
implementation of peacekeeping operations," General Leonid 
Ivashov, secretary of the council of defense ministers of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. 
  A week ago BERLINGSKE TIDENDE was able to report that Moscow 
had contacted Denmark to bring about cooperation in the field of 
peacekeeping. However, what is new is that Russia is proposing 
that Denmark assume a leading international role in the field. 
  Per Carlsen, Defense Ministry chief of section, said that 
the 
Russian request is currently on Defense Minister Hans 
Haekkerup's desk. According to Per Carlsen, Denmark will 
respond to the Russian call for cooperation either by sending 
its own delegation to Moscow or by inviting the Russians to 
Copenhagen. 
  Gen. Ivashov added that conflict prevention and peacekeeping 
missions are the predominant problem in the former Soviet Union 
that has been hit by several armed conflicts. The problem is at 
the top of the agenda of the defense cooperation among the 
former Soviet republics. 
  According to Ivashov, Moscow's awareness of Denmark's 
internationally acknowledged experience in this field has played 
a crucial role in the Russian request. "The political means 
that the world community has at its disposal today are clearly 
inadequate. This is something we can see in the former 
Yugoslavia, for example," Gen. Ivashov added. 
  Ivashov pointed out that inside military alliances there is 
a 
tendency to put the stress on the use of force and military 
intervention in armed conflicts. "We hope that Denmark will 
tackle things differently. It is important that the stress 
should now be put on the formulation of political mechanisms in 
the resolution of conflicts," Gen. Ivashov said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Birgitte Stampe, head of the Danish Police </F>
Intelligence Service, by Ib Konrad Jensen and Jens P. Skaarup in 
Copenhagen; date not given: "Birgitte Stampe Is Head of a 
Public Institution That Prefers Privacy"] 
  [Text] It is not every day that Danish journalists 
interview someone who arrives carrying a briefcase with a 
built-in safe. But Chief Constable Birgitte Stampe, 48, prefers 
to take such precautions. For who knows whether or not someone 
is waiting round the next corner intending to mug the head of 
the Danish Security Police. He may get her, but he will not get 
her secret papers. 
  It is fundamental to the organizational ethos of the Police 
Intelligence Service, PET, that the utmost efforts are made to 
ensure that nothing -- NOTHING -- on the secret service's work 
falls into the wrong hands. 
  As few papers as possible -- the greatest possible 
protection 
of them as possible. And no question of tape recorders on the 
table when the head of the PET speaks to the public. Written 
notes on a notepad are OK, but not a tape with the chief's own 
voice. Just think how it might be used. 
  It is all so discreet that the head of the PET is not even 
prepared to receive POLITIKEN journalists in her own 
surroundings in the intelligence headquarters out at Bellahoej. 
For the first interview of any length given by a head of the 
PET in a generation, she has chosen to borrow an empty executive 
office in the huge police commissioner's building in central 
Copenhagen. 
  [POLITIKEN] Why is that, exactly? 
  [Stampe] It is in line with our general philosophy. We work 
best under cover. So, as few visitors as possible. 
  [POLITIKEN] How many people are registered today in the 
PET's 
files -- not counting those who are there because their job in 
the public sector requires security clearance? 
  [Stampe] I do not wish to give exact figures. But the 
numbers have remained more or less constant in recent years. 
  [POLITIKEN] The figure of 12,000 has been mentioned. 
  [Stampe] Yes, but it is probably slightly less now. 
  [POLITIKEN] Why are they there? 
  [Stampe] Because there is information on them that is 
thought 
to be significant in intelligence terms. 
  [POLITIKEN] What does that mean? 
  [Stampe] I do not wish to answer that. 
  [POLITIKEN] Since 1968, the PET has not been allowed to 
register Danish citizens "solely on the grounds of lawful 
political activity." How does the PET distinguish between 
lawful and unlawful political activity? 
  [Stampe] Belonging to an established political party is 
obviously lawful political activity. 
  [POLITIKEN] If one chooses instead to be active in 
extraparliamentary opposition politics, or take part in new 
political movements, does one run the risk of becoming the 
object of PET interest? 
  [Stampe] One runs the risk of becoming an object of our 
interest if one behaves in a way that falls under or that may 
fall under articles of criminal legislation that concern us. 
That is, the legislation on striking at state security. It is 
quite certain that one has crossed the threshold of lawful 
political activity if one uses nonpeaceful or indeed violent 
means. 
  [POLITIKEN] Why do the almost 12,000 people have to remain 
on 
file as being suspected of antistate activities or attempts at 
such, when there is so little prospect of their ever being 
indicted and punished? 
  [Stampe] The people in question are registered because the 
information we have on them is of interest in intelligence 
terms. It is true that not many charges are brought. In fact, 
extremely few. But that is because our main task, according to 
the instructions regulating our work, (instructions dating back 
to 1953, the "hottest" period in the Cold War -- editor's note) 
is first and foremost to monitor, prevent, and counteract 
crimes. The very low charge rate means that not many crimes are 
committed. The PET has to measure its success in terms of the 
lack of criminal cases. 
  [POLITIKEN] Do the files contain a broad cross-section of 
the 
community? 
  [Stampe] I cannot answer that question. I am not that 
familiar with the personal circumstances of those on the 
register. 
  [POLITIKEN] We understand that a broad cross-section of the 
population supplies the PET with information on other Danish 
citizens, working as PET informers. 
  [Stampe] It would probably be fair to say that. But it is 
not just informers that we make use of, i.e., information from 
individuals. We also obtain information from other authorities, 
from firms, and from open sources such as newspapers and 
periodicals. And I should like to stress that we are of course 
careful in assessing the reliability of each individual source 
before going further. We do not charge out into the street and 
arrest a man because somebody or other passes on a hint of 
something ugly. We must never use information from an 
unreliable source. 
  [POLITIKEN] Is the PET ready to pay for information? 
  [Stampe] No comment. 
  [POLITIKEN] Why does the PET not tell those registered that 
they are registered? Then they would know that the PET is 
keeping an eye on them, and that would perhaps prevent them from 
committing criminal actions? 
  [Stampe] We do indeed sometimes hold what we call preventive 
conversations with people. But I would say generally that an 
intelligence service carries out a special type of job that is 
best done away from the public gaze and without too many 
people's knowledge. If we always told the people concerned when 
they were registered, they might just waste no time in removing 
both the proof and maybe themselves too. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  Since 1964, the various justice ministers have had a 
four-member committee acting on their behalf to approve the 
PET's registration of inividuals and communication of 
information from the files to other authorities. This is the 
so-called Wamberg Committee, with Chief Administrative Officer 
Bodil Panild, Soroe, Senior Archivist Hans Christian Bjerg, The 
State Archives, Publishing House Director Kurt Fromberg, 
Gyldendal, and Solicitor Niels Fisch-Thomsen, Copenhagen. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  [POLITIKEN] But the Wamberg Committee has no opportunity of 
testing PET's information and assessments -- that is, the 
justification for the registrations. Of what use, then, is the 
control? 
  [Stampe] I think it is going too far to imply that the 
control is worthless. No, I would put it differently: You can 
rest assured that what we submit to the committee is the 
absolute truth. The people working for the PET are honorable. 
I myself attach enormous importance to the lawful conduct of 
our work. 
  [POLITIKEN] We are not talking about the PET's honorable or 
dishonorable nature. We are speaking about control, and what 
value a control function has when it is limited to a choice 
between trusting PET material or not trusting it. After all, 
the State Audit Department would never be content, when asking a 
public institution whether it has used its funds as prescribed 
and receiving the expected reply "yes," to simply answer: 
"Fine, we will go away again then." How often does the Wamberg 
Committee turn down a request for registration? 
  [Stampe] I can only say that it is very rare. That is due to 
our great care in sifting the cases, so that the only ones we 
present for registration are those that are strong enough. It 
would be completely wrong to claim that the Wamberg Committee is 
in the pocket of the PET. 
  [POLITIKEN] How is the nature of the PET's work changing in 
line with changes in society? For example, what effect has it 
had that the left wing is far less aggressively vocal than it 
was just a few years back, while the extreme right is becoming 
very active? 
  [Stampe] When society changes, we naturally respond by 
shifting resources so that we concentrate our strength on the 
relevant tasks of the day. One could say that we constantly 
adjust in the light of the threat assessment picture. 
  [POLITIKEN] It goes without saying that the PET must be left 
in peace during the investigation of a case, but why can nothing 
be said about it later? 
  [Stampe] It can and is when the case ends up in the courts. 
But when we end up shelving the case, we generally say nothing 
at all. If we did, it would reveal our methods of investigation. 
  [POLITIKEN] Can they not stand the light of day? 
  [Stampe] Yes, certainly, but we may damage our opportunities 
of investigation in the future if we talk about them. In the 
same way as we must protect our sources and our cooperation with 
foreign intelligence services. I fear it would do a great deal 
of damage if we were to suddenly throw all the doors open. Our 
credibility as a working partner would be lost. But having said 
that, I agree that there is a need for greater openness 
surrounding the work of the PET. That is the realization I have 
come to after hearing so many different comments about us. Some 
think that we do virtually nothing at all, while others believe 
that we are standing on every street corner and that we see 
everything. But openness must be limited to the general 
situation -- such as I am discussing now. 
  [POLITIKEN] Why can the PET not do as, for example, the 
German police intelligence service does, and send out quarterly 
reports on its work -- on where the current threats to society 
are coming from and which groups are now being watched? 
  [Stampe] I do not think that would be advisable at the 
moment. We are after all a small country, where we all know one 
another, and where we cannot mention specific groups without in 
fact also naming names. 
  [POLITIKEN] But what right does the PET have to expect the 
public to trust the PET's information, when you are so 
incredibly secretive? 
  [Stampe] I can well understand that people have difficulty 
in 
seeing the reasonableness of something about which they know 
very little. But I do not see that that need has anything to do 
with our credibility. Anyone will tell you that an intelligence 
service must be allowed to work discreetly, and as a result, 
there is nothing immediately suspicious in an intelligence 
service not stepping forward and talking a great deal about 
itself. But when we do say something, it must be the truth. 
  [POLITIKEN] The PET has around 350 personnel -- 150 criminal 
investigation police, 100 uniformed police, and 100 office 
staff. How large is the budget? How large is the annual budget? 
  [Stampe] I do not know. But it is confidential, and anyway, 
we do not spend a lot. 
  [POLITIKEN] Why is the size of the budget kept a secret when 
the numbers employed appear from the Commissioner's annual 
report? 
  [Stampe] It is not appropriate to reveal anything about the 
size of the budget. People with a particular interest in our 
work must not be able to deduce the extent of our capabilities. 
  [POLITIKEN] But that can be virtually worked out by looking 
up the Commissioner's report and seeing how large the staff is. 
Is it not paradoxical to release these figures but not the 
budget? 
  [Stampe] I have no further comment to make on that question. 
  [POLITIKEN] Hand on heart, is it not very convenient to be 
the head of an institution which is not accountable to the 
public as regards what the public actually gets for its money? 
Just think how the other branches of the police force or, for 
example, an educational establishment are often forced to 
justify every 1,000-kroner note they spend. 
  [Stampe] The special circumstances surrounding the PET in 
this regard have no effect on the day-to-day work. There is no 
more to be said on that issue. 
  [POLITIKEN] Out of consideration for state security, the PET 
on occasion has to turn a blind eye to less serious crime, in 
the hope of uncovering something larger. One example: The PET 
does not arrest someone for an ordinary burglary if, by letting 
him go free, it has a chance to uncover his links with a KGB 
agent. 
  [Stampe] I have absolutely nothing to say on that subject. 
  [POLITIKEN] Where does the threshold lie for necessary 
intervention, irrespective of the overriding aim of surveillance? 
  [Stampe] No comment. 
  [POLITIKEN] How, in general terms, does the PET tackle the 
following dilemma: If the PET arrests someone for a minor 
criminal act, the larger case is spoiled. If it does not, the 
PET is ignoring the police's obligation to intervene in all 
cases where the law is broken. 
  [Stampe] I do not wish to say anything on that subject. 
  [POLITIKEN] Last: Have you, prior to this interview, 
consulted with others on what you should say and especially what 
you should not say on the PET? 
  [Stampe] No. 
  [POLITIKEN] And finally: What does a head of the PET do when 
she is not monitoring her fellow citizens or citizens of foreign 
nationality? 
  [Stampe] Now that is of absolutely no interest to the 
public.

<F P=106> [Report by Risto Riihonen: "Particle Accelerator Would </F>
Bring Finland 40 Billion"] 
  [Text] "Getting a linear accelerator to Finland depends on 
us. It is a question of our taking the initiative." 
  Professor Risto Orava, head of the Research Institute of 
High-Energy Physics at the Helsinki University (SEFT) admits 
that the skeptics are mainly to be found within the scientific 
community. 
  "Experts are divided into two schools of thought: those who 
have no faith in the project, and those who believe that the 
linear accelerator will pull Finland out of the depression." 
  The accelerator project was first debated in 1991 at a 
conference of experts in Saariselk. This is where key 
international people from the World Particle Physics Laboratory 
are to meet next fall. The final decision on the construction 
will be made between 1995 and 1997. 
  Risto Orava explains that the decision will be made on the 
basis of a feasibility study. Japan and the United States, who 
have competed with Finland, have in practice lost out, due to 
the earthquake sensitivity of their regions. 
  "The particle accelerator at Stanford University in 
California broke in two in a tremor that preceded the major 
earthquake this week. It is unlikely that the Americans would 
again invest millions just to ensure that the institute is 
installed in their own country. 
  "Finland's strong points are its solid bedrock, technical 
infrastructure, and stable political situation. The World 
Laboratory of Particle Physics, which may be ready as early as 
2005, will be dedicated to basic physical research and the study 
of elementary particles. The world's sixth largest particle 
laboratory, which is to be financed by the international 
community, will cost 40 billion Finnish markkas [FMk]. 
Finland's share of the investment is in the order of 1 percent, 
i.e., we are in practice only expected to contribute with the 
required land area. 
  "The laboratory's operating costs will be about FMk1 billion 
per year. The research institute will employ thousands of 
researchers and technical experts, in total about 10,000 people 
including families. The 40-km-long accelerator will be built at 
a depth of 100 mt under the ground. The worldwide annual cost 
for the prestudy of the linear accelerator is at the present 
FMk300 to 500 million. In order to establish its credibility as 
host country, Finland is expected to contribute about FMk4 to 5 
billion." 
  Risto Orava maintains that Finnish research in particle 
physics is on a high international level. "We are members of 
CERN [European Center for Nuclear Research], where we rank third 
after Switzerland and France in terms of our ability to exploit 
the results of the work carried out. Finland has several 
ongoing R&amp;D projects related to the construction of a linear 
accelerator. Research institutes and industries take part in 
these projects. 
  "The potential benefit from the design, development, and 
construction of the components is enormous. The electron 
source, the positron source, the damper ring, the particle 
bundler, the preaccelerator, the main accelerator, the focusing 
system, and the test station offer work opportunities for 
researchers and the industry."

<F P=106> [Article by Erika Bjerstrom: "High Profile Required for </F>
Influence"] 
  [Text] The Swedish environment will deteriorate, and in 
return, we will gain greater influence over European Union (EU) 
policy. But it will require a high environmental profile on 
Sweden's part. That is the assessment of the environmental 
consequences of membership. 
  This is not an unequivocal endorsement of membership. The 
issue of the EU and environmental policy is much too complicated 
for that, Anders Wijkman, chairman of the Environmental 
Consequence Committee, said when he presented the committee's 
report. 
  The committee's analysis was based on a 10-year perspective 
of the consequences of EU membership, the European Economic Area 
(EEA) agreement, or staying out of the EU. The conclusions have 
been summarized in the form of the answers to three questions: 

  -  How will Sweden's chances for an independent environmental 
policy be affected? 
  Conclusion: Little difference, no matter which scenario 
Sweden chooses. 
  Needed: No hesitation in utilizing all possibilities to 
exert 
influence. 
  "An overcautious interpretation of the EC rules could lead 
to 
a kind of self-censorship in which we set narrower restrictions 
on our actions than are necessary. It would be better to stretch 
the limits even if it involves the risk of a court test," the 
committee members wrote. 
  "We have discussed in detail the value of remaining outside 
as a model in the California style. Tough environmental rules 
cannot be created internationally, individual countries must 
take the lead. But it would require a very strong economy and a 
powerful Riksdag majority behind environmental measures for this 
to work. As these prerequisites are lacking, the difference 
between joining and staying outside is very small," Wijkman said. 

  -  What are Sweden's possibilities of influencing the EU's 
environmental policy? 
  Conclusion: Greatest with membership. 
  Needed: An offensive strategy and resources. 
  "We must distinguish between our chances of exerting formal 
and informal influence. But with our scant 4 percent of the 
votes in the Council of Ministers we have little chance of 
contributing to a qualified majority. A passive Sweden will have 
no influence on the EU's environmental policy at all. By 
maintaining a high profile we can have great informal importance 
as members," according to Wijkman. 

  -  How will environmental conditions in Sweden be affected? 
  Conclusion: Membership will involve the biggest problems. 
  Needed: More far-reaching measures. 
  EU membership will lead to increased growth. This can result 
in an increase of as much as 10 percent in carbon dioxide and 
nitric oxide emission, according to the committee's calculations. 
  "The EU is responsible for 60 percent of the nitric oxide 
fallout over Sweden, and its carbon dioxide emission is 40 times 
higher. If we can contribute to changes in the union's 
environmental efforts, it could compensate for the increased 
Swedish emissions," according to Per Kagesson. The committee 
concluded that radical rethinking with respect to energy, 
traffic, and the purpose of growth is required. This applies to 
both Sweden and the EU. 
  "My conclusion is that consideration for the environment and 
environmental policy is no barrier to joining the EU," Wijkman 
summed up.

<F P=106> [Article by Ulf Martensson and Johan Selander: "New </F>
Democracy Splinter Group Forms New Party"] 
  [Text] It was not a perfect match. On Saturday [15 January] 
the New Democracy [NYD] breakaway faction formed a new party in 
Vaxjo, the Riksdemokraterna [National Democrats]. The party will 
nominate candidates in the Riksdag election and compete with NYD. 
  The splinter group's main criticism involves the control 
from 
the top that characterizes NYD, in its view. For example, the 
party leaders in Stockholm autocratically decide on the slate of 
Riksdag candidates, the National Democrats charge. 
<H5>  Protecting Children, the Aged </H5>
  "It is no longer possible to influence New Democracy," 
according to newly elected party leader Birger Andersson, a 
47-year-old business consultant from Farjestaden, Oland, who 
said his main goals are to protect the interests of children and 
old people--and knock NYD out of the Riksdag. 
  Bert Karlsson does not view the new party as a threat. 
  "It is good that they formed this party. If they have 
different views, then of course they should make a party out of 
them. But I doubt they have much more in common than their 
negative attitude toward New Democracy," he commented on the 
decision in Vaxjo. 
  There is great dissatisfaction with Ian Wachtmeister and 
Bert 
Karlsson among NYD members, according to representatives of the 
new party who think they can get as many as 10 percent of the 
votes in a Riksdag election. 
  Last year the splinter group formed a NYD municipal 
federation consisting of around 40 local NYD associations. This 
happened after NYD decided at an extra meeting to be solely a 
Riksdag party. Local NYD associations were given a chance to 
enter into cooperative agreements with the Riksdag party. 
<H5>  Will Not Go After Refugees </H5>
  Helena Karlgren, a 32-year-old law student and mother of two 
from Eslov, Skane, is a new female face in Swedish politics. At 
the founding meeting of the National Democrats in Vaxjo 
yesterday she was elected as the party's first vice chairman. 
  Her goal is to win a seat in the Riksdag and knock out NYD, 
which she describes as a "wolf in sheep's clothing." 
  "It is an undemocratic party with racist elements," she 
said. 
  In spite of this, the breakaway party is using the NYD 
program as a basis. But the National Democrats will have a 
democratic control apparatus. A municipal federation made up of 
member associations in the municipalities will have insight into 
the activities of the party's executive committee. 
<H5>  Refugee Policy Tough Enough </H5>
  That is exactly how Karlgren and newly elected chairman 
Birger Andersson wanted to reorganize NYD. They tried to get 
Wachtmeister to listen to them. 
  "But he was completely unreasonable when we met him in 
November." 
  It was after that disappointment that the idea of breaking 
away from the party took concrete shape. 
  The new party's program will be worked out during the next 
few weeks. 
  How will the National Democrats differ from the New 
Democrats? 
  "We will apply democratic organizational principles. Unlike 
NYD, we will not concentrate on going after individual refugees. 
Refugee policy should be revised, but we do not want a stricter 
policy. It is tough enough, in view of the fact that we deport 
90 percent of those who come here." 
  Karlgren also mentioned youth unemployment as an important 
issue. But the party will announce what it will do to combat 
this problem later. 
  "The pension system should be revised in order to provide 
pensions that everyone can get by on. They should be the same 
for everyone. And it should then be possible to supplement them 
with private insurance." 
<H5>  Does Not Believe in Bloc Politics </H5>
  The defense force should be a career army, without getting 
rid of universal military conscription. 
  "I think we can have both. The Swedish boys who are serving 
in Bosnia today should be given an opportunity to serve in 
Sweden instead," she said. 
  Before she became involved in NYD, Karlgren always voted for 
nonsocialist parties. 
  Are the National Democrats a nonsocialist party? 
  "No. I think we stand exactly in the middle. I do not 
believe 
in bloc politics," she said. 
  And the European Union? 
  "That is a good question. I must first confer with my party 
chairman on this point," said Karlgren, who feels she has 
something to contribute to Swedish politics, partly because she 
is a member of the "lost" generation of the 1960's and partly 
because she is a woman.

<F P=106> [TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA report: "Sifo Poll Shows Lead </F>
for No to the EU"] 
  [Text] No to the EU [European Union] leads by 40 percent 
to 32 percent. This is shown by the latest poll that Sifo 
[Swedish Institute for Opinion Research] has carried out for 
GOTEBORGSPOSTEN. 
  But opposition has only increased marginally, and the yes 
side has held on to most of the marked advance it achieved in 
the previous poll. 
  The latest poll was carried out from 7 to 10 February, at 
the 
same time as the Swedish negotiations in Brussels were running 
into difficulties. Nevertheless, the new yes sayers did not 
flock to the opposition side, the newspaper notes. 
  In January the percentage of those saying yes rose from 26 
to 
34 percent. In February the yes side had 32 percent, a decrease 
that lies within the margin of statistical error. 
  The no side is still leading by a relatively comfortable 
margin. It also increased a little, from 39 to 40 percent. 
  But many people have still not made up their minds. The 
percentage of those who are undecided rose from 27 to 28 percent. 
  Young people are no longer markedly more negative to the EU 
than the population as a whole, the poll shows. And young 
people under 30 have made up their minds to a greater extent 
than others -- only 23 percent of the 1,000 interviewed are 
doubtful. 
  Divided up according to party sympathies, the latest poll 
shows no statistically firm changes. 
  However, the number of those saying yes among nonsocialist 
voters has decreased from 60 to 54 percent. 
  Among Social Democrats, the trend for the percentage of 
those 
who are undecided to increase at the expense of those saying no 
continues. 
  Uncertain Social Democrats now number 32 percent, 47 percent 
are against, and 21 percent for.

<F P=106> [Stefan Koskinen report: "Less Smuggling in the EU"] </F>
  [Text] It will not only be possible to keep drug smuggling 
to Sweden at the same level. Drug smuggling will actually 
decrease if Sweden joins the EU [European Union]. So said 
European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel (Moderate Coalition 
Party), quite contrary to all the fears expressed in the past 
about increased drug smuggling. 
  Yesterday Social Affairs Minister Bengt Westerberg (Liberal 
Party), Justice Minister Gun Hellsvik (Moderate Coalition 
Party), and Ulf Dinkelspiel made public the government's program 
for combating drugs in the event of EU membership. 
  "The aim is not to compensate for the removal of border 
controls and achieve the same results as today; the aim is to be 
better," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. 
  This will happen through increased cooperation and an 
improved exchange of information among the policemen of the EU, 
and through the increased scope to exert pressure on countries 
like the Netherlands. In addition, the customs service will be 
given more resources for investigation and spot checks, since EU 
membership means that the customs service will not have to carry 
out checks on trade between Sweden and the EU. 
  "Membership will free up major resources in the customs 
service. That is why the government is taking the initiative 
for an overhaul of the customs service to produce better 
coordination with the police and the coast guard in the field of 
combating drugs," Gun Hellsvik said. 
  Ulf Dinkelspiel also stressed that it is only a small part 
of 
the narcotics that are confiscated that get caught in the 
customs filter [sentence as published]. 
  "Nor do we want to tie our hand but want to try new methods. 
The British, for example, have introduced narcotics surveillance 
on their ferries with some success and this is perhaps worth 
trying." 
  The increased international cooperation will take place 
within the European criminal police bureau, Europol, which is 
currently being set up. Europol will be a center for criminal 
intelligence services. 
  "Europol will chiefly concentrate on narcotics and we can be 
involved if we are not members of the EU," Gun Hellsvik said. 
  The ministers also declared that Sweden's restrictive 
narcotics policy would remain in place in the event of 
membership of the EU. Bengt Westerberg stressed that Sweden's 
narcotics policy has been a success when compared with the rest 
of Europe. 
  Bengt Westerberg also commented on the tendencies toward 
liberalization that exist in a number of European cities with 
regard to cannabis. 
  "This trend has no support at government level. Not even in 
the Netherlands where people are becoming wary and are 
tightening up their view of hash," Bengt Westerberg said.

<F P=106> [George Johansson report: "Declining Opposition to the EU"] </F>
  [Text] EU [European Union] supporters now outnumber EU 
opponents in Sweden. The figures are 39 percent for and 30 
percent against, according to the latest EU poll carried out on 
behalf of DAGENS INDUSTRI and SKOP [Scandinavian Opinion Polls]. 
  This is mainly due to the decreasing number of opponents 
rather than a growing number of supporters. 
  In January, 39 percent of Swedes thought that Sweden should 
definitely or possibly join the EU. This figure, which is more 
or less unchanged since November-December, confirms an earlier 
indication that the negative opinion trend was reaching its 
peak. Since October the number of supporters has increased by 8 
percent. 
  The number of Swedes who think that Sweden should definitely 
or possibly not join the EU, on the other hand, has fallen from 
34 percent in December to 30 percent in January. The greatest 
drop is among those totally opposed. The number of absolute 
opponents has been falling continuously from the figure of 42 
percent recorded in September. 
  The proportion of undecided voters increased during this 
period from 26 to 31 percent. That represents a growth of 2 
percent since September, not confirmed by the statistics [as 
published]. 
  The undecided continue to be crucial for the outcome of the 
vote. This category would still be inclined to vote no if the 
referendum were held today. The opposition would then win by 53 
percent against 47. That is a 6-percent lead, compared with 23 
percent in November-December and 25 percent in September. 
  A more positive attitude toward the EU is permeating through 
all voter categories. Socialist sympathizers have taken a much 
more positive attitude, with 27 percent in favor and 37 percent 
against in January. The proportion of "don't knows" among 
socialist sympathizers topped 75 percent in September. 
  In the conservative camp, those inclined to vote yes 
represent the same 52-percent majority as in September. 
  "Support for the EU is growing among men and women, old and 
young, blue- and white-collar workers, and employees in the 
public and the private sector", Birgitta Hultaker of SKOP said. 
<H5>  EU -- The Most Difficult Plebiscite of All Time </H5>
  "Three, maybe four, important factors will determine Swedish 
opinion on the EU issue from now until the voting -- and it will 
be impossible to predict its final course," Soren Holmberg, 
election researcher at Goteborg University, said. 
  The forthcoming crucial debate around the Swedish vote will 
mainly depend on: 
  1. The ability of the parties to rally and capture their own 
groups of voters. It is generally easier for people to change 
their views than to switch party. 
  2. External events affecting Sweden, such as developments 
within the EU, unrest in East Europe, etc. 
  3. Economic development. The EU debate has been very 
materialistic so far. Favorable economic development in Sweden 
between now and the referendum will give more room for other EU 
issues, such as environment, equality, and peace. 
  4. The setup of the debate. No previous plebiscite in Sweden 
(right-hand traffic, general supplementary pension, nuclear 
energy), except for the one on alcohol prohibition in 1922, has 
given rise to such emotional involvement among the Swedes as the 
vote on EU membership. 
  Soren Malmberg believes that this is due to the "catchall" 
nature of the EU issue. 
  "The EU can be linked to everything: Economy, national 
security, equality, environment, industry, growth, unemployment, 
peace, etc., and this makes the issue difficult and unwieldy. 
It is impossible to predict how public opinion in Sweden will 
evolve, especially if you consider that two parliamentary 
parties -- the Social Democrats and the Center Party -- have 
evaded the issues and confounded their voters for such a long 
time." 
  The nature of the debate -- and the scope created by the 
actors on the scene -- will of course depend on the first three 
elements in the opinion scenario outlined by Soren Holmberg. 
  "The peace issue, which I see as being fundamental to the 
whole concept of the EU, has not received much attention in the 
debate so far. Except for a brief spate of euphoria less than 
two years ago, the EU debate has hitherto focused on 
materialistic issues and the economy."

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In the final phase of the accession 
negotiations, EU and Swedish negotiators are trying to find a 
way to secure regional aid for the sparsely populated northern 
part of Sweden. Ingrid Hedstrom writes in the 17 January 
Stockholm Swedish daily DAGENS NYHETER on page 7 that at the end 
of December the EU had offered to classify the area as a first 
priority region, allowing it to receive EU support reserved for 
underdeveloped regions. To be classified as such, however, an 
area's GNP must be only 75 percent of the EU average; the GNP of 
the Swedish northern provinces is 113 percent of the average. 
Swedish negotiators are looking for new ways to calculate the 
GNP so that it will fall below the limit. They have excluded 
revenue from hydropower stations located on northern rivers, 
which raise GNP figures but do little to increase the welfare of 
the region. In this way, they succeeded in lowering the figure 
to below the 75-percent limit in certain areas. According to a 
14 January Stockholm Swedish daily DAGENS NYHETER article on 
page 7 by Ingrid Hedstrom, EU officials are also trying to come 
up with new criteria for their regional policy. An EU source 
told the newspaper: "They [the new criteria] must be idiotproof 
and watertight, and applicable only to Sweden, Norway, and 
Finland. One possibility would be to use a certain latitude 
line as a criterion."

  [Text] The U.S. State Department's annual report on human 
rights in Cyprus for 1993 is not only incompatible with truth 
and justice, but also with the supposed policy of the United 
States for protection of human rights worldwide. 
  The above is stressed by the International Association for 
Protection of Human Rights in Cyprus. The association adds: 
The report ignores the decisions of the United Nations and 
other international organizations regarding the Turkish invasion 
and the illegal pseudostate. It also ignores the decisions of 
the Council of Europe's Committee on Human Rights, which in 1976 
and 1983 decided that Turkey was guilty of mass and continuous 
violations of the Greek Cypriots' human rights in the occupied 
part of Cyprus. 
  In substance, the association notes, the State Department's 
report recognizes the division of Cyprus as permanent, gives 
legal status to the Turkish Cypriot "administration" and 
indulgence to the Turkish troops, deceives on basic issues and 
distorts the facts against the Cypriot people. Especially on 
the pseudostate, there is reference to "free elections" and 
respect of "human rights." 
  The association also stresses that the report becomes even 
more scandalous if one bears in mind that it follows similar 
reports in past years, and the fact that the real events were 
always very well known. The inaccuracies and distortions of 
previous reports have been pointed out by a delegation of the 
association to the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus in order to avoid a 
repetition in future reports.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said the National 
Council unanimously suggested that the Greek Cypriot side should 
attend the proximity talks beginning on 17 February. Kliridhis 
was speaking after a lengthy National Council meeting today to 
discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue and the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
  The president said there were some differences in views and 
that some people suggested disengagement from the CBM's while 
others said we should discuss them but on the basis of some 
principles. Answering questions, Kliridhis said that when he 
attends the talks, his goal will be to discuss those points that 
the UN secretary general refers to as the basic points in his 
set of ideas. He said he expects Butrus-Ghali to announce these 
points tonight. 
  DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis said we are 
now facing decisive developments for the future of the country, 
so our side must move carefully. On the handling of the 
discussion of the Cyprus issue, Matsis said there has been a 
noteworthy change with the European Union observer's 
intervention and presence at the talks. He continued: We 
believe that the observer's reports, as his orders say, should 
be in line with European law. Matsis added that DISI is 
determined to support the president during this decisive course 
for the Cyprus issue so as to hold talks in the most effective 
manner. 
  AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary 
General Dhimitrios Khristofias said that when the president 
decided to participate in the proximity talks he should have 
manipulated the discussion to include the substance of the 
Cyprus issue. Khristofias said that AKEL has no intention of 
covering up the faits accomplis created by the president, adding 
that AKEL interprets any reference to the substance of the 
Cyprus issue as a return to discussing Butrus-Ghali's ideas. 
  DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou reiterated 
that he considers the CBM's as unacceptable and very dangerous. 
He said: We are afraid that if the CBM's are implemented they 
will form the basis of an overall Cyprus solution. He added 
that the measures solve the illegal regime's problems and 
therefore Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side have no reason to 
pursue a reasonable Cyprus solution. The DIKO chairman said 
disengagement from the measures is necessary, adding that his 
party made suggestions on how the president should handle the 
issue. 
  Socialist party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] 
Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis said he pointed out ways to disengage 
from the measures, adding that all the prerequisites exist for a 
return to discussing the substance of the Cyprus issue. He said 
he believes the contrasting views expressed in the National 
Council strengthen the president's negotiating position.

<F P=106> [Report by Kostakis Andoniou] </F>
  [Text] Reliable political circles estimate that the Turks 
will wreck the talks on the confidence-building measures for the 
following three basic reasons: 
  1. Turkey does not want a solution, nor has it made the 
political decision to proceed with serious dialogue that would 
facilitate the promotion of the issue. Consequently, an 
agreement on the confidence-building measures would force the 
Turkish side to proceed with other steps as well, which would 
lead to the achievement of an agreement that is not in Ankara's 
plans at this time. 
  2. [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas believes that the 
only concession he will make for an overall solution of the 
Cyprus issue is to turn over Varosha. It is the last card he 
will play in order to "end the game." However, from the moment 
he offers this card before the achievement of a final solution, 
he will be forced to negotiate and give up other parts 
throughout the process of the talks. 
  3. The opening of the Nicosia Airport will automatically 
deprive him of any argument to ask for recognition of the 
illegal airport in Tymbou and the special FIR. 
  These appraisals come from reliable political circles and 
cause great pessimism within the government, which does not 
expect progress in the talks on the confidence-building measures. 
  The same circles also stressed that according to our 
experts' 
assessment, the problem for our side is not the operation of 
Nicosia Airport and the arrangements that will be agreed upon, 
but the issue of Varosha. Specifically, there are reservations 
about the fact that if there is no withdrawal of the Turkish 
troops from the "passage" to Dherinia, there will be no way out 
for those who return. 
  Despite the practical difficulties and the certainty that 
the 
Turkish side will wreck the confidence-building measures in the 
end, the same political circles stressed that: The Greek 
Cypriot side could not refuse participation in the talks because 
its refusal would actually destroy any further deliberation 
process on the Cyprus issue. It would also slam the door on 
deliberations for the promotion of Cyprus' access to the 
European Union.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas stated the people's consent 
is required for the agreement reached during the negotiations to 
be viable. 
  Noting that where the negotiator's duty ends the people's 
will begins, Denktas added that for the agreement to be viable 
the people should give their approval of their free will. 
Stressing that he is the defense advocate of the people and not 
a marketing manager, Denktas said that the only way to show the 
Greek Cypriots' ploy to the world is by means of negotiations 
and not by lamenting that the Turkish Cypriot is being sold. 
  In answer to questions regarding the recent statement by 
Glavkos Kliridhis, leader of the south Cypriot administration, 
Denktas said that he has long since considered a referendum 
necessary should an agreement be reached on the 
confidence-building measures. He added that according to the 
Constitution a referendum is a prerequisite. 
  In answer to a question about Kliridhis' repeating the EOKA 
[National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] oath at a meeting in 
Europe as well as pledging on the Greek Cypriot flag that they 
are in office to fulfill to the utmost their duties toward 
Cyprus, Denktas recalled that Makarios, Kiprianou, and Vasiliou 
also shared the same views. Further stating that the Turkish 
Cypriots are aware of the Greek Cypriots' goals, Denktas added 
that the Greek Cypriots in turn are aware that the Turkish 
Cypriots are not going to let them have access to that goal. 
Denktas indicated that the Turkish Cypriot side will continue 
with negotiations so long as they do not pose a threat. 
  Denktas reiterated that they will not consent to an 
agreement 
that will not be to the advantage of the people. Noting that 
there are reports as to the package containing items favorable 
to the Turkish side, Denktas added that the truth of these 
rumors will be revealed on the negotiating table. Stating that 
they depend on the people of the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus, Denktas added that he expects the people to act with 
common sense concluding that the Turkish Cypriot side should not 
be the one to leave the negotiating table.

  [Text] Greece assumes a new initiative to avert the West's 
threatening military engagement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias today went to Belgrade to promote 
this initiative. Papoulias will meet Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic to discuss the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
which are at an extremely critical point. 
  Before his departure from Ellinikon Airport, Foreign 
Minister 
Papoulias stressed: I am going to Belgrade on a very important 
trip, especially because it is just a few days, a few hours, 
before the expiration of NATO's ultimatum. These are the last 
intensive efforts we can make to save the peace. I believe, 
Papoulias added, that the talks we have will be important and 
productive in the direction we all want, that is, to promote the 
European Union's plan and the peace process. There is no other 
way, he said, and added: The road to peace is one way and 
whoever thinks that with the use of force they will manage 
something better than what we have achieved thus far, I think he 
does not evaluate the situation correctly. 
  According to REUTER, it is possible that Papoulias will not 
return to Athens but will visit another capital in Europe.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias returned late 
last night from Belgrade where he had long meetings with Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic. 
  Papoulias stressed: There is much hope that we can avoid the 
worst in the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, as reports on the 
withdrawal of heavy weapons from around Sarajevo are hopeful. 
However, he noted this process is not the exclusive obligation 
of the Serbs and the Muslims should do the same. Papoulias 
expressed Greece's fears for the chain reaction a general 
conflict would have in the Balkans and in Europe, and added that 
he does not believe air strikes can bring peace. 
  The Greek presidency of the European Union [EU] also is 
contemplating calling a meeting of the EU Council of Foreign 
Ministers before the deadline of NATO's ultimatum, the Greek 
foreign minister said. Responding to a question if Athens will 
exercise a veto in NATO on the air strikes, he said that Greece 
is contemplating and will use all available means to avoid a 
wider conflict. Papoulias also stressed that he discussed the 
possibility of the war spreading to the south with Milosevic, 
and underlined that something like this would be a tragic 
development and the beginning of an armed conflict that would 
have wider consequences in Europe. Responding to another 
question, the foreign minister said that the Greeks living in 
Serbia are safe. They consider it their second homeland and 
have no need to leave.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who is on an 
official visit to Turkey, has not abandoned his anti-Turkish 
approach. He concluded secret agreements with Russia on oil 
some time ago. It has now become apparent that he is supporting 
the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. He has appointed several 
PKK sympathizers to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic Internal 
Affairs Ministry. They have facilitated the move of PKK members 
from Turkey to Armenia through Nakhichevan. Furthermore, 
Aliyev, who is one of Moscow's underlings, has used state funds 
to finance and distribute DENGE KURD, a newspaper that opposes 
Turkey. 
  Geydar Aliyev, who is known for his support of initiatives 
against Turkey, is on Ankara's agenda [as published] because of 
his support for the PKK. Aliyev describes Turkey as a friendly 
and fraternal country whenever he finds himself in a difficult 
situation. However, he has tried to stab Turkey in the back at 
every opportunity. Meanwhile, another of his deceptive moves 
has been exposed. Aliyev has cooperated with Armenia in 
providing funds and logistical support to the PKK, which is 
trying to divide Turkey. He has appointed PKK sympathizers, who 
are known to be militants, to the Nakhichevan Internal Affairs 
Ministry. They have facilitated the move of PKK terrorists from 
Turkey to Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  Geydar Aliyev is known as an indispensable person for 
Russia. 
He has supported PKK's printed propaganda activities in 
Azerbaijan. Recall that not so long ago Aliyev placed all of 
Azerbaijan's press organs under his control and obstructed those 
opposed to his regime. Meanwhile, his administration has met all 
the needs of DENGE KURD, from ink to paper. That newspaper is 
printed in Cyrillic in Baku. Furthermore, he has allowed PKK 
members to open 20 shops in Baku. DENGE KURD is a newspaper 
opposed to Turkey. Aliyev has guaranteed its distribution 
through the help of his administration. While conveying 
friendly messages to Turkey, Aliyev has exposed his true face by 
supporting the treacherous elements. 
  DENGE KURD is a PKK newspaper supported by Aliyev. It 
describes southeastern Anatolia as a part of Kurdistan. 
Furthermore, it describes Abdullah Ocalan, who is the leader of 
the PKK terrorists, as the "national leader of the Kurdish 
people." 
  The following are several passages from the October 1993 
edition of DENGE KURD, which is supported by Aliyev: 
  "The Turkish State is a servant of imperialism. The 
liberation of the Turkish people depends on the strengthening of 
the PKK and the independence of the Kurdish people." 
  "I organized the Kurdish people's struggle for independence 
not because I am a Kurd but because I am a socialist." 
(Quotation from Abdullah Ocalan) 
  "Everyone is fighting in Kurdistan at the present time. Of 
course, the children are fighting as well...." 
  "Turkey has not changed its chauvinist and Kemalist 
traditions. Meanwhile, the Kurdish people are changing to 
achieve progress in accordance with the training they receive 
from the PKK. That will guarantee our future...." 
  Aliyev served as a KGB general and then as first deputy 
prime 
minister in the former Soviet Union. He has been known as one 
of Moscow's most favored employees for more than 25 years.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb.15 (A.A) -- Russian neo-fascist 
politician Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is not able to visit Turkey for 
the time being, it was reported today. 
  The Russian politician was reportedly supposed visit Turkey 
as the guest of a daily. 
  Sources near to the Liberal Democratic Party led by 
Zhirinovskiy told AA that the Russian politician who had 
reservations at the Turkish Airlines for Monday with a 15-strong 
delegation, could not make the trip because the tickets bought 
by the daily could not reach the Moscow office of the Turkish 
Airlines in due time. 
  However, an official of the daily told AA that the Foreign 
Ministry had not approved of the visit of the Russian politician 
and therefore they have canceled the invitation.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Albert Chernyshev, Russia's </F>
ambassador to Turkey, by NOKTA correspondent Tulay Cetingulec in 
Ankara; date not given--punctuation as published] 
  [Excerpts] [NOKTA] You have been in Turkey for seven years 
and you will return to your country as the deputy foreign 
minister in March. You have been described as a "lustful" 
person and an "agent." Can you describe how you feel as you 
prepare to leave Turkey? 
  [Chernyshev] I told myself when I arrived in Turkey that I 
was "a man first, then a politician and diplomat." I still feel 
the same. My lengthy stay is described in Russia as a 
"forgotten mission." But I have become very familiar with 
Ankara. Relations between Turkey and Russia have always been 
favorable, despite the reports that have been published in 
various newspapers. Of course, I have been troubled by the 
reports that were published against me. Such is the fate of 
diplomats. My new appointment is a promotion. I will visit 
Turkey frequently because my field of study is the Black Sea, 
Caucasus, Central Asia, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and 
India. [passage omitted] 
  [NOKTA] Russia has moved to redeploy the troops it withdrew 
from the independent republics. Moscow recently decided to 
dispatch troops to Georgia and establish bases there. Does 
Russia wish to reestablish its former strength in the region? 
  [Chernyshev] True, we withdrew our military forces from the 
republics in the Caucasus some time ago. Of course, we did not 
withdraw them all. The disintegration of the former Soviet 
Union left those republics without military forces. They do not 
have their own armies right now. Their security problems must 
be solved. Agreements have been reached with those republics at 
their request. Turkey has similar agreements with the United 
States. In accordance with those agreements and on the basis of 
the consent of the CIS republics, the Russian border guards have 
assumed the responsibility of guarding their borders in Central 
Asia. That must not be seen as an imposition by Russia. The 
countries concerned will meet Russia's expenses one way or 
another at some point. That means guarding borders will not be 
free. The repayment may not be in the form of cash. It may be 
in the form of particular convenient measures. Several 
newspapers have claimed that Russia's approach is aimed against 
Turkey and other countries. That is not true. Russia's 
military units have not been deployed for an offensive purpose. 
Russia will maintain a symbolic presence of 23,000 troops in the 
Caucasus. 
  [NOKTA] You said in a statement two years ago that "you are 
afraid of the pan-Turkic ideology." Do you still fear that 
ideology? Isn't the pan-Slavic ideology a threat? 
  [Chernyshev] Aggressive nationalist and separatist trends 
existed in the past. Unfortunately, they still exist now. The 
pan-Slavic, pan-Arab, and pan-Turkic ideologies, including 
fundamentalism, remain. Placing these extreme trends under 
control is very important. We have a common understanding with 
Turkey on that. We are prepared to cooperate to struggle 
against extreme trends. 
  [NOKTA] Can you comment on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's approach? 
  [Chernyshev] As far as the pan-Slavic, pan-Russian, and 
pan-Nazi trends are concerned, Zhirinovskiy can be regarded as 
an example. His statements conflict with our official foreign 
policy. They have nothing in common. His views are not binding 
on Russia. But they will be considered. As far as politics are 
concerned, Zhirinovskiy has no horizon or perspective. He has 
gained popularity because of the problems created by reforms. 
Compared with the work the political parties carried out to 
explain the differences among them during the election campaign 
in Russia, Zhirinovskiy's campaign was very rudimentary. While 
waiting for a miracle amid the difficulties at the time, the 
people voted for that primitive [ilkel] man. But he has only 64 
of the 450 seats in parliament. Zhirinovskiy's party has no 
serious officials. Literally speaking, he is a one-man show. 
  [NOKTA] Reports say he will visit Turkey soon. What does he 
expect to achieve through his visit? He has said Russia has a 
dangerous weapon that is more effective than a nuclear bomb. Is 
that true? 
  [Chernyshev] Does such a weapon exist in the world? No, 
Russia has no such weapon. Zhirinovskiy is just talking. 
That's all. Not only has he spoken against Turkey, but against 
several other countries. This has harmed Russia's relations 
abroad. I have no information on his visit to Turkey. But I 
believe we should also work with him. We must understand him. 
He sometimes says he "loves Turkey." But he also says he is 
"opposed to Turkey." You have similar officials in Turkey. But 
I talk to officials like him. 
  [NOKTA] Can you comment on the common interests between 
Turkey and Russia and on where things clash? 
  [Chernyshev] Turkey has agreed that Russia has long-standing 
and wide-ranging interests in its relations with the CIS and the 
republics in Central Asia in the political, economic, and 
cultural fields. Russia has agreed that Turkey has gradually 
increasing interests in the region. No clash between the 
interests of Turkey and Russia can be allowed to take place. 
Any inclination by either country to move the other out of the 
region will be obstructed. 
  [NOKTA] Foreign Minister Kozyrev has said that the clashes 
in 
the Balkan region and the tension created by religious 
differences may kindle a third world war. And a difference of 
opinion exists between Turkey and Russia on Bosnia. 
  [Chernyshev] We have condemned the massacre in Bosnia. No 
national war based on religious differences is being fought in 
that country. The fighting has been caused by the mistakes of 
the past. Extremist elements must be blamed for the war. 
Everyone wants to be independent. But they all lived together 
in the past. I agree that the sides did not enjoy equal rights. 
The Bosnians are of Serbian origin. But they adopted the 
Islamic faith 500 years ago. Most of them were atheists under 
communist rule. Basically, we are Orthodox people. But you 
should ask who follows the Orthodox faith in Moscow? The people 
would not know. It is an artificial separation. Independence is 
very costly for the peoples. Independence without funds and 
resources will create problems. How will the minorities exist? 
Independence is very costly. 
  [NOKTA] Should the concept be abandoned? 
  [Chernyshev] What should be considered first is the issue of 
territorial integrity. That should be followed by minority and 
human rights. There will be upheaval if everyone wants to 
become independent. A third world war may break out. A serious 
threat exists. The issue of the independence of Bosnia and 
Karabakh may cause upheaval in the world. So a threat exists. 
  [NOKTA] There was upheaval in the former Soviet Union. Has 
that threat been warded off? 
  [Chernyshev] The disintegration of the Soviet Union was a 
serious mistake. Everyone is suffering now. An effort is being 
made to correct that mistake. Please forgive me for saying that 
only stupid people like us are clamoring for "independence." 
But I have no use for such an independence. The most important 
thing is to learn to live together. That is difficult to 
achieve. Such independence may be a concept in principle but it 
should not apply in practice.

  [Text] Strasbourg, Feb 4 (A.A) -- Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese presented a file of the outlawed separatist terrorist 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization which included the 
organization's relations with drug traffic, it was reported on 
Friday [4 February]. 
  Mentese who is currently attending a Council of Europe 
ministerial meeting on drugs said the file showed that PKK had 
links with 53 drug traffic incidents which happened between 
1990-1993 adding that nearly four tonnes of heroin were seized 
during this time. 
  Mentese said European security officials also confirmed the 
organization's activities on drug traffic. 
  The file gives the names of the terrorists from the outlawed 
separatist PKK organization who were earlier caught together 
with large quantities of narcotics in several countries of the 
world and in Turkey. 
  Meanwhile, a document published at the end of the meeting, 
with Turkey's initiatives, said "European countries strengthen 
their commitment that they will work together against terror 
organizations who have links with drug traffic."

<F P=106> [Column by Hadi Uluengin "The Aftermath of the Attack on </F>
Zhalah Camp"] 
  [Excerpts] Either someone is lying or an effort is being 
made to distort the facts. One does not need to be an 
astrologer to realize this state of affairs. Studying the 
official statements and the chronology of the developments will 
be enough. [passage omitted] 
  The disclosure by the military officials after the air 
attack 
on the Zhalah Camp in northern Iraq, which has been described as 
the most intensive air raid since the establishment of the 
republic, said that the targets were completely destroyed and 
the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] suffered many casualties. 
However, the PKK, Democratic Party of Kurdistan, leader Mas'ud 
Barzani and the Turkish journalists who visited the area have 
disclosed that the PKK suffered few casualties. 
  It will be recalled that in the past General Dogan Gures, 
chief of the General Staff, accused those who sought a 
nonmilitary solution to the Kurdish problem of "making 
nonsensical remarks while sipping whiskey in the Bosphorus." 
This time, he has accused those who have questioned the air 
operation of "lobbying for the bandits." He has done so when 
even former President General Kenan Evren, who led the military 
takeover of the administration on 12 September 1980, has 
described the air attack as an unsuccessful operation. In view 
of this, should he also be regarded as a member of the "lobby of 
the bandits?" 
  Who is telling the truth about the attack on the Zhalah 
Camp? 
  It will be recalled that Tehran lodged a protest over the 
bombing of Iran's territory, noting that the bombs that were 
dropped on Iran killed and wounded several people and caused 
damage to property. The General Staff rejected Iran's protest. 
However, the information the Turkish Consulate in Orumiyeh 
conveyed to Turkey and the delegation Ankara sent to the region 
confirms Tehran's claims. In fact, it will be recalled that a 
government spokesman has disclosed that Turkey will compensate 
Iran. 
  Considering all that, how can the discrepancy between the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Turkish Armed Forces be 
explained? Which of the two state establishments is telling the 
truth? 
  Sources affiliated with the General Staff have said that the 
operation against the Zhalah Camp cost 12 billion Turkish lira. 
However, Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin has said that 
the operation cost 1 trillion Turkish lira. Which of the two 
figures is accurate and who is telling the truth on that matter? 
[passage omitted] 
  Civilians wish to learn from all the establishments, 
including the military, who claim to be totally open, about who 
is telling the truth about the attack on the Zhalah Camp. As 
tax payers funding the budget of $32 billion, the citizens 
demand a disclosure of the military spending in southeastern 
Turkey, which total $6 billion. They wish to know how this 
effects inflation rates. 
  Those who call for a nonmilitary solution to the Kurdish 
problem want a civilian administration in Turkey. Their 
question of "who is telling the truth" is not aimed at serving 
the "lobby of bandits." On the contrary, they ask that question 
because they want to preserve Turkey's national unity. They are 
convinced that national unity can be maintained only through a 
political and non-military solution to the Kurdish problem, a 
solution that will establish peace and equality.

  [Text] Ankara--Widening trade deficits and plunging foreign 
aid put Turkey's current account deficit in the first 11 months 
of 1993 at an all-time high of $5.54 billion, a staggering 
increase of 896.5 percent from a deficit of $556 million during 
the same period of 1992. 
  The Turkish Central Bank (CB) said Thursday [17 February] 
that the economy produced a current account deficit of $717 
million in November 1993 compared with the minor deficit of $51 
million in November 1992. Turkey's balance of payments situation 
has radically worsened since early 1993 when the export market 
gave initial signals of a recession. The trade gap for the 
January-November period of 1993 was $12.86 billion, 80 percent 
higher than the deficit of $6.14 billion during the same period 
a year ago. 
  Turkey's foreign debt repayments in the first 10 months of 
last year reached $7.2 billion, of which $4.61 billion was 
principal and $3.1 billion were interest payments. Turkey had 
made foreign debt repayments of $7.2 billion in the 
corresponding period of 1992. 
  The foreign investment flow into the country during the 
January-November period declined from $703 million in 1992 to 
$529 million last year, representing a decrease of 24.5 percent. 
In the same period, Turkish tourism revenues rose by 7.7 
percent to $3.8 billion compared to 1992, while workers' 
remittances declined to $2.68 billion from $2.7 billion a year 
ago.

  [Excerpts] The two dreadful days, the prospects of which 
were causing alarm within the government, are finally upon us. 
The government is taking measures to prevent a new crisis in 
the market with the planned payment of 17 trillion Turkish lira 
in civil servants' salaries tomorrow and 27 trillion for the 
internal debt the next day. 
  But the civil servants, over whose salaries a political 
storm 
has broken out, fail to understand the governments' concern. 
[passage omitted] 
  The news of the issuance of 44 trillion has already started 
affecting the money markets. The dollar fell and interest rates 
rose. Most important of all, the stock exchange, which had been 
sliding for weeks, suddenly rebounded. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Today, investors were happy at 
the Istanbul stock exchange where for the last three weeks every 
100 Turkish lira invested lost 52 Turkish lira in value. The 
index rose by 1,232 points and leveled at 15,096. 
  The hope that part of the 44 trillion to be injected into 
the 
market tomorrow will flow into the stock exchange has already 
pushed prices up. 
  [Muslun Demirbilek, president of the stockbrokers 
association] This atmosphere appears to be conducive for the 
stock exchange to reestablish its balance. Therefore, our 
advice to our investors is not to sell their valuable shares and 
take a long-term view, as time is working to the advantage of 
the stock market. 
  [Reporter] The banks also supported the idea of keeping 
holdings in Turkish lira. IS Bank, TYT Bank, and Demirbank 
increased their interest rates for savings accounts 2-6 percent. 
The yearly interest rate rose to 105.5 percent. [end recording] 
  Each person is making his own calculations in these critical 
days. On the one hand we have the dollar and on the other the 
Turkish lira. Where will the money flow? 
  Measures have already been taken today to prevent the flow 
of 
money starting tomorrow from causing a new black Wednesday, as 
happened two weeks ago. Interest rates rose and the value of 
foreign currencies fell, and the Treasury and the Central Bank 
have gone into action. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] The government fears the money 
could be converted into foreign currency and then hidden under 
the bed. The Treasury and the Central Bank will act together to 
prevent such a thing, which might lead to devaluation of the 
Turkish lira and then to inflation. 
  These two government institutions will use the weapon of 
high 
interest rates to absorb the 17 trillion in salaries and 27 
trillion in internal debt. 
  The Central Bank will sell advance notes issued to it by the 
Treasury to the banks and collect the money. The Treasury 
itself will sell bonds at 125 to 130 percent interest to the 
people. Thus, the demand for foreign currency, a phenomena 
observed after each payment of salaries to the civil servants, 
will be stopped. In short, the government will try to prevent a 
new black Wednesday. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article signed O.G.: "Israeli Government and Twelve </F>
Negotiate New Cooperation Agreement"] 
  [Text] Among other things, Israel would like to see free 
trade extended to the services sector, and to be involved in 
European research programs. 
  On Wednesday [16 February], the European Commissioner 
responsible for Cooperation and Development, Mr. Manuel Marin, 
will go to Israel where he will meet with Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, among others. During his visit, the European 
Commission vice president will announce the formal launch of 
negotiations aimed at producing a new cooperation agreement 
between the Twelve and Israel before the end of the year. This 
agreement will replace the old one in effect since 1975, and has 
been on the cards for some time in the light of developments in 
international relations or certain advances made at the level of 
the European Community, e.g., the entry into force of the single 
market and Maastricht Treaty, the creation of the European 
Economic Area [EEA], and the signature of new agreements between 
the Twelve and several Maghreb countries. The drafting of a new 
agreement has proven particularly indispensable since conclusion 
of the "Gaza and Jericho first" option between the Israelis and 
the Palestinians last September. 
  The agreement constitutes a second dimension of the European 
Union's policy in the region, for Europe is the main source of 
funds in the Middle East, with a program worth ECU500 million 
spread over five years. According to European Commission 
President Jacques Delors, the agreement will enable the European 
Union [EU] to give guarantees to Israel, which he describes as 
"an industrial society whose principal outlet is Europe." 
  "Israel has changed, the Community has changed, and the 
world 
has evolved," explains Mordechai Drory [Israeli ambassador to 
EU]. "What we are now asking of the Twelve is an updated version 
of the economic and commercial chapter of the old cooperation 
agreement, entailing adjustments made to the agricultural 
dossier, a modification of the original rules and regulations, 
or even the extension of free trade to services. As for 
scientific cooperation, Israel would also like to be involved in 
European research and development programs, especially in the 
industrial sector." 
  Since the early 1980's, trade exchanges between the two 
parties have become progressively more imbalanced, to the 
detriment of Israel. Israel's trade deficit vis-a-vis the 
Twelve rose to ECU3.1 billion in 1992, with the EU remaining the 
Israeli Government's leading trade partner -- with Germany ahead 
of Great Britain and France on a country by country basis. To 
what may this trend be attributed? Mordechai Drory believes 
that the main cause has been the lack of European investment, 
and the absence of joint ventures between Israelis and European 
investors: "People have been reluctant to invest in Israel, due 
to the political situation, and the Arab boycott of Israeli 
products. Most investments in Israel have been made by major 
international groups of U.S. origin, which have not hesitated to 
come here, among other things because they are being actively 
supported by their government. In the United States there is an 
extremely tough antiboycott law, which threatens any U.S. 
entrepreneur who responds positively to threats of an Arab 
boycott. There is also a law of this kind in some member states, 
but not at European level." 
  Today, agricultural produce represents only 20 percent of 
our 
exports to the European Community. However, between them, the 
Twelve alone absorb nearly three-fourths of Israeli exports of 
agricultural products, stresses Mordechai Drory: "Consequently, 
in this sector, the European market is of vital importance to 
Israel." Furthermore, proportionally speaking, Israel exports 
less high-tech products to the European Community than it does 
to the United States. "That is mainly due to the fact that a 
large share of our industry is concentrated in high technology. 
We have few unskilled workers, no raw materials, and a very 
high level of research. However, the more highly developed an 
exporting nation becomes, the more high-tech products it 
imports. The United States has this politico-economic base, so 
it imports more products of this kind from Israel. The 
situation is different according to the member states."

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD (SVD): "NATO Has Not Requested Belgian </F>
F-16's -- Which Have No Countermeasures"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 15 Feb (BELGA) -- NATO has made no request 
to Belgium to supply planes for possible air strikes in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, the Belgian Defense Ministry stated on Tuesday [15 
February]. 
  But privately military officials confirm that the Belgian 
F-16's are not sufficiently well equipped -- especially with 
electronic countermeasures, designed to locate and perhaps jam 
antiaircaft defense mechanisms such as those used by the Serbs 
around Sarajevo -- to be used in an operation of this kind. 
"Belgium has received no request for air power from NATO," 
declared a spokesman from the defense minister's office, Mr. Leo 
Delcroix. 
  NATO's air and combined air and sea forces deployed in Italy 
and the Adriatic consist of some 220 aircraft, including more 
than 150 fighter planes supplied by the United States, France, 
the Netherlands, Turkey, and Great Britain. But no Belgian 
plane is included in this force, known as "deny flight" and 
charged since 12 April 1992 with preventing any military flights 
in the Bosnian airspace. 
  A senior air force official recently admitted that without 
any electronic countermeasures (ECM) it would be difficult for 
the Belgian F-16's to take to the sky over Bosnia without 
jeopardizing the lives of the pilots. The Bosnian Serb Army is 
equipped with numerous antiaircraft systems, often similar to 
those used by the former Warsaw pact countries. 
  The F-16's, which are used in Belgium for both air combat 
and 
ground attack missions, are to be fitted from the beginning of 
next year -- two years behind the initially scheduled date -- 
with their first "carapace" ECM systems, designed by the French 
electronics company Serge Dassault (ESD). 
  Military sources report that four prototypes of the carapace 
system have already been built by ESD following a lengthy 
development phase which was completed in December 1992. Two 
such systems have been fitted to planes which left for the 
United States in April last year for twelve months of tests at 
the Eglin test polygon (Florida). 
  Mr. Delcroix' office reports that production of the first 
systems should begin in March. Delivery of the first planes 
equipped with the ECM system is scheduled for early 1995, the 
same source indicated. 
  The carapace system -- developed exclusively for Belgium -- 
is a purely passive system, which means it can detect an enemy 
radar and inform the pilot. Ideally, it should be supplemented 
by an active system able to jam radar systems. It does, 
however, have the advantage of being fitted inside the aircraft, 
thus leaving all arms attachment points free and not causing any 
extra drag. 
  Observers recall that the lack of any ECM's on the F-16's 
was 
one of the reasons why mirage fighters had been preferred to 
American fighters when Belgian planes were sent to Turkey just 
before the outbreak of the Gulf war, in January 1991. 
  The Dutch and Turkish F-16's stationed in Italy and which 
make daily flights over Bosnia are equipped with electronic 
countermeasures. The Dutch Air Force has acquired a number of 
ECM pods which can be attached to a wing or the fuselage. The 
Turkish F-16's have internal ECM's.

<F P=106> [Article by Ian Davidson: "Not As Bleak As It Looks"] </F>
  [Text] The London and Dublin governments are to give a new 
push to their initiative for peace in Northern Ireland. In 
their joint Anglo-Irish declaration, launched two months ago, 
they held out the explicit possibility of eventual unification 
of the two halves of Ireland, if that was what the people of 
Ireland wanted. But the essential precondition for setting this 
initiative in motion was that the IRA terrorists must first 
declare a ceasefire. 
  That precondition has not been met. The IRA has not rejected 
the offer, but the fact that it has not stopped the bombing and 
shooting suggests that a permanent ceasefire is not very likely. 
The UK and Irish prime ministers meet next week to see where 
they go from here; it looks as though they need to think again. 
  The rationale for the December declaration was a belief that 
the IRA was tired out after 25 years of fruitless terrorism, and 
might give up. Yet even if the terrorists are tired it requires 
great faith to conclude that they can now be converted to 
democracy. And even if most of the terrorists were prepared to 
give up, Whitehall officials seem to fear that they may be held 
hostage by the out-and- out extremists. 
  If the IRA does not agree to give up terrorism, the two 
governments must rethink their initiative from top to bottom. 
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said 
Britain will press ahead with new moves, including devolved 
local government in the province; perhaps it may. But a 
political process that leaves out the hard republicans, and 
perhaps the hard unionists will be a meagre affair beside the 
comprehensive agenda of the December declaration. 
  Yet the strategic position may be less bleak than it looks 
because various parts of the truth are now being made plain. 
First, the declaration gives explicit recognition not just to 
the undeniable old fact, that Northern Ireland is historically 
and geographically part of Ireland, but also to the new 
political fact, that its future will be decided not in London 
but in Ireland. In the introduction to the declaration, the two 
governments say their aim is a "new political framework founded 
on consent," and a purely British passage says "it is for the 
people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts 
respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination, on 
the basis of consent, if that is their wish." Neither passage 
can give any comfort to rightwing nationalists at Westminster, 
let alone to die-hard unionists among Northern Irish Protestants. 
  Such an explicit recognition by the UK of the legitimacy of 
the claims of Irish unity (though only by consent) is 
unprecedented. But the corollary of the principle of consent is 
that terrorism, so far from advancing the cause of Irish unity, 
makes it impossible. The very premise of terrorism is a denial 
of democracy, the total negation of consent. In Northern 
Ireland, the two communities are too evenly balanced to admit of 
a victory of one over the other. IRA terrorism cannot lead to a 
political victory for the nationalists, because the immediate 
consequence would be more terrorism by extremist Protestants, 
most probably a civil war. 
  If the leaders of the IRA were to take up the offer of 
"reconciliation, leading to a new political framework," that 
would be wonderful; but it may be too much of a miracle to hope 
for. If they do not, then the IRA and Sinn Fein will both be 
politically dead meat. If they reject the opportunities offered 
by the declaration, they will have forfeited their claim to 
speak for the people of Ireland; and they will have shown that 
terrorism takes precedence over politics, and that Sinn Fein is 
ruled by the IRA, not the other way round. 
  But whether the IRA says yes or no, the central problem in 
the declaration is with the definition of the concept of 
consent. The reason for the terrorism by Catholics and 
Protestants is that consent is lacking; and even if the 
terrorism stopped, consent would still be lacking. In fact, 
there is never likely to be, in our lifetimes, the kind of 
political majority, either for keeping or for changing the 
constitutional status quo, which could be counted on to produce 
a permanent and peaceful settlement of the Northern Ireland 
question. 
  The corollary is that the medium-term future of Northern 
Ireland will be decided not by local parties or local 
majorities, but by agreement between the governments of Britain 
and Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew professes to rule out any idea 
of joint authority over Northern Ireland; but in strategic 
terms, that is precisely what is implied by the Anglo-Irish 
declaration. When the two governments say their aim is "a new 
political framework, within Northern Ireland, for the whole 
island, and between these islands," they are talking about 
shared authority, almost a de facto condominium. 
  One detailed study has argued for a "de jure condominium," 
through an Anglo-Irish treaty. This would be an extraordinary 
innovation in constitutional practice, and would have 
difficulties with the old-timers in the House of Commons. But 
it would make logical sense, because it would rule out, for 
ever, the only grounds for terrorism: the hope of total victory 
by one community at the expense of the other. And it could also 
make a creative political contribution to the development of 
interstate relationships in the context of the European Union. 
  But if London dare not admit the reality of condominium, at 
least let us have no more talk of self-determination. We have 
seen what it has achieved in former Yugoslavia, and we do not 
need that kind of self-determination in Northern Ireland.

  [Text] Now that a possible NATO intervention in Bosnia has 
not been ruled out, let us have a look at our Air Force. It is 
not official yet, but it is no secret that the [Belgian] F-16's 
cannot take part in the [possible NATO] operations because they 
are not fitted with the necessary equipment. However, the 
Netherlands' F- 16's are operational should air raids be 
decided. Christophe Deborsu has investigated this issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Deborsu] Our F-16's were not involved in 
the Gulf war and they also will not be used in Bosnia. The F-16 
is an excellent aircraft, but the Belgian Air Force has not had 
the [financial] means in 15 years to outfit it with proper 
components. Freddy van de Weghe, spokesman for Air Force 
foreign operations, explains why: 
  [Van de Weghe] Our F-16's are not yet fitted with certain 
devices -- although they will be next year through the 1995 
investment project -- in particular, with an electronic 
countermeasure system, which therefore makes them more 
vulnerable to certain types of antiaircraft weapons than other 
planes which are fitted with that system and which could be used 
in air raids. 
  [Deborsu] Next year, our F-16's will finally be fitted with 
a 
so-called passive electronic countermeasure system. This device 
makes it possible for the pilot to know if an enemy radar has 
locked onto him. Thus, the pilot knows in advance if he is a 
target and, therefore, has some time to try to escape the enemy 
missiles. On the other hand, the Belgian Air Force cannot 
afford to purchase an "active" countermeasure system, i.e., a 
system that not only detects enemy radar but also jams it. The 
Netherlanders have electronic systems -- active and passive -- 
on their own F- 16's. 
  Another problem is that the Belgian Air Force jets are not 
equipped with laser components. In order to target Serbian 
artillery positions with precision, without causing harm to the 
surroundings, the laser guidance system is by far the best 
solution. 
  As a consequence, NATO will use, if necesary, aircraft 
better 
equipped than ours. But the lack of those electronic systems 
should not be criticized overly. Indeed, according to 
Beauvechain Air Force base, our pilots often beat foreign pilots 
who fly better-equipped planes during training sessions. The 
reason for this is easy to understand: The Belgian pilots have 
learned to make the best use of the limited equipment they have 
while foreign pilots are at a loss as soon as one of their 
gadgets breaks down. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Admiral Marcel Duval, former chairman of our the </F>
National Defense Studies Committee and director of DEFENSE 
NATIONALE: "What Future for the Nuclear Weapons 
Nonproliferation Treaty?"] 
  [Excerpts] The Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which covers 
a 25-year period, will expire in 1995. Negotiations will then 
be needed to set the terms for its renewal. Admiral Marcel 
Duvan was kind enough to carry out an analysis of 
nonproliferation, of the treaty, of the concerns of different 
nuclear and nonnuclear states, and finally of the prospects for 
the future, particularly for our country. We are most grateful 
to him for this very complete study. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Future Prospects </H5>
  Having taken stock of nonproliferation, the term hitherto 
used to describe the totality of measures to prevent the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, let us now examine 
its future prospects on the eve of its expiry in 1995. As for 
the NPT itself, its indefinite renewal, which naturally is 
desired by the nuclear powers, would require an affirmative vote 
by 83 countries, since it is estimated that 165 countries will 
then be party to it. As the general assumption is that 45 
positive votes are guaranteed, those of at least 38 developing 
countries will also have to be secured. The Conference of 
Nonaligned States, which met in 1992, set the following 
conditions for extending the treaty: the cessation of nuclear 
tests; an end to the production of nuclear weapons; 
implementation of the START treaties; and the total elimination 
of these weapons by a given deadline. Furthermore, during the 
conference to prepare the revision of the NPT, which took place 
in May 1993, it appeared that many nonnuclear states, not all of 
which were nonaligned states, will oppose indefinite extension 
and may even propose a two-year trial period, at the end of 
which their demands would have to be implemented through 
international treaties. 
  We have seen that the United States has now decided to meet 
most of these demands by proposing the conclusion of a treaty 
totally banning nuclear tests, and of another prohibiting the 
production of fissile materials for explosive use. For its 
part, the United States has already declared a moratorium on its 
tests until 1995, and stopped its production of fissile 
materials, while also accepting international monitoring of its 
stocks. In addition, it has ceased modernization of its nuclear 
arsenal, since, for the first time for 50 years, it is no longer 
running a nuclear program now that it has ceased further work on 
its mobile strategic missile, and it canceled both its light 
strategic missile program and its programs for new nuclear 
warheads for its Trident submarine missiles and for new nuclear 
missiles for its B2 bombers. It has also undertaken the 
dismantling required by the START treaties, even though these 
have not yet been ratified by the other parties. In the face of 
this voluntary disarmament, some have wondered, analyzing 
statements by Americans in senior positions, whether this did 
not amount to a delegitimization by the United States of nuclear 
weapons so as to derive maximum advantage from its undisputed 
conventional superiority over any possible adversaries anywhere 
in the world. 
  Nevertheless, problems may still arise with other 
protagonists involved in the renewal of the NPT and the adoption 
of any other planned nonproliferation agreements linked to it. 
First, take the chaotic situation in the former Soviet Union, 
which particularly raises, as has been seen, the problem of 
Ukraine's adherence to the NPT. There will then remain the task 
of dismantling those nuclear weapons affected by the START 
treaty, which will take over 10 years and will require 
considerable financial assistance, not to mention the 
difficulties arising from the international monitoring of its 
implementation. To these concerns we should add, mindful of the 
Chernobyl catastrophe, those over the safety of nuclear plants 
for peaceful purposes and over the possibility of subjecting 
these plants to the controls which will inevitably be required 
by a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for 
weapons use. Finally, it is obvious that the degree to which all 
these proposals are welcomed in 1995 will be primarily 
influenced by the actions taken before this expiry by China, the 
most "proliferating" state whose actions frequently differ from 
its statements and which has the right of veto. It will also 
depend on the behavior of the undeclared nuclear powers. In 
other words, it will depend on Iraq's respect for its commitment 
to accepting long-term monitoring of its disarmament; on the 
outcome of the present confrontation over monitoring North 
Korea's installations; regarding Israel and Iran, on the peace 
process presently under way in the Middle East; while it may be 
hoped that the mutual deterrence between India and Pakistan will 
prevent their dispute over Kashmir from degenerating into open 
war. History teaches us that disarmament of all kinds is far 
more often a consequence of peace than the necessary 
prerequisite for it. This means that the struggle to prevent 
proliferation is undoubtedly far more of a political process, 
particularly at a regional level, than a matter of preventive 
technocratic measures. This does not imply that the latter have 
no effect, even if it is only to do everything possible to avoid 
the use of nuclear weapons in haste or in error, since, once the 
"nuclear taboo" has been breached, they have failed in their 
peacekeeping purpose. 
<H5>  Consequences for France </H5>
  We now have to consider the consequences of all the above 
for 
France, which for the past 35 years has based its defense policy 
on the peacekeeping effect of nuclear weapons, and has largely 
based its foreign policy on the independence of its deterrent. 
Thus, the "French exception" in this area will be particularly 
challenged by the nonproliferation measures to be submitted in 
1995 to the international community. 
  Of these, the major concern is obviously the total cessation 
of nuclear tests, since this not only poses both for ourselves 
and for others a threat to the safety of existing weapons, but 
would also prevent us from developing new programs, even though 
we presently have at least one major one under way, the M5, 
which, by considerably increasing both range and performance, is 
intended to give our "new generation" of nuclear-missile 
launching submarines (SNLE) "all-out" capabilities. To this 
technological constraint is added the psychological, and hence 
political one, which is bound to challenge the two super powers' 
previously announced renunciation of mobile strategic missiles 
and multiple warheads, and of terrestrial and naval tactical 
nuclear weapons. In contrast, the cessation of production of 
fissile materials for explosive use would not appear to have any 
major consequences for our defense, at least over the medium 
term. 
  The increase in "denuclearized zones" would also seriously 
limit the freedom of action of our nuclear submarines, as they 
presently carry almost 90 percent of our nuclear deterrent 
capability. If this process were to extend to Europe, following 
the apparently conceivable withdrawal of U.S. airborne nuclear 
capacity still deployed there, then this would put an end to the 
possibility of eventually establishing a European deterrent. 
For this reason, and also to finally frame a common policy in 
this matter, it would be desirable to discuss all these 
nonproliferation measures within the European Union, or, failing 
this, on a Franco-British basis, as allowed by the recent 
establishment of a Joint Commission on Nuclear Policy and 
Doctrine. At the national level, it would also appear desirable 
to reactivate the Council on Exterior Nuclear Relations, set up 
in 1976 to respond to the concerns then beginning to be aroused 
here by proliferation. 
  The survival of our national deterrent, together with the 
need to consider establishing such a deterrent at the European 
level, must be justified in terms of the effectiveness to be 
expected of them in the face of threats which can be foreseen 
over a fairly long term. In this respect, the threat emanating 
from the still considerable nuclear arsenals located in the 
territory of the former Soviet Union has in no way disappeared, 
however unlikely any aggression by them appears at present. The 
greatest danger is probably that of the possibility of these 
nuclear weapons falling into the hands of groups of varying 
degrees of responsibility, for whom the exercise of our 
deterrent, backed up by the threat of massive reprisals, would 
run the risk both of being unacceptable to international public 
opinion, and of being ineffective. The same would apply, we 
believe, to any "troublemaker" located outside Europe who, armed 
with a few primitive weapons and suitable ballistic vehicles, 
would hide in some kind of "aggressive sanctuary," or even 
perpetrated nuclear blackmail. 
  In the face of such possible threats, two schools of thought 
are taking shape here. The first holds to the above doctrine, 
restricting it to the instance of major aggression, actually 
directed against our national territory, for which it feels the 
present arsenal is adequate. The second considers there is a 
need for a limited "nuclear counterthreat," capable of 
deployment overseas and intended to "inhibit" the destructive 
capacity of a terrorist state, and if need be to "decapitate" 
it. This would require, in the view of this school, very 
accurate mobile weapons with reduced collateral effects, with 
adjustable power, and the capability to penetrate the ground, 
and would thus mean new programs, and hence the need to carry 
out tests. In contrast, a rapprochement seems to be emerging 
between the two schools over the possible benefits, in the face 
of these new threats, in possessing a system based on ballistic 
theater antimissiles, or in other words a mobile system, even 
though during the Cold War France was opposed to any global 
system. Some consider that the disadvantage of establishing 
such a system is that it could give the "South" the impression 
that it is about to replace the "East" as the Western world's 
enemy. 
  The expiry in 1995 will therefore force us to formulate a 
view on all these matters. As for doctrines, we do not feel it 
is desirable to specify too closely the future conditions in 
which our nuclear deterrent could be used, or particularly to 
say what will not be done, so as to keep all our options open. 
It appears obvious that this deterrent will not be able to 
remain the absolute priority it was during the Cold War; but, as 
is amply proved by the present debates over nonproliferation and 
also those over the future course of the Security Council, it 
will certainly retain its political dimension. As it is no 
longer possible to "disinvent" the nuclear weapon, France must 
protect itself from its human know-how and its technical 
capabilities in this area, as these are largely what will ensure 
its future status as a "major medium power," and, if necessary, 
its survival if it were to be the object of any major aggression.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fabbri: `Seselj Is a Madman'"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Serbian extremist Vojislav Seselj's threats 
against Italy? "Raving and empty," Defense Minister Fabio 
Fabbri writes in an article published today in the GAZZETTA DI 
PARMA. Fabbri emphasizes that Seselj is a well-known extremist, 
and not a member of the Belgrade government: "His proclamations 
aim to inflame Serbian ultranationalism." 
  "Any military actions," Fabbri adds, "could only come from 
Serbia, which has inherited the Armed Forces of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], but not from the Bosnian Serb 
militias. Any attack on us would therefore amount to an act of 
war on the part of the Serbian-Montenegrin federation against 
our state -- which would add a very serious dynamic to the 
Bosnian crisis, with unpredictable consequences." In any case, 
according to Fabbri, the FRY Army has no surface missiles 
capable of reaching Italy. If they were to attempt to use their 
MiG-21's and MiG-29's, these would be stopped by NATO's 
defensive screen; again, if they tried to use their "Osa" and 
"Konkar" class torpedo boats, which are equipped with 
surface-to-surface missiles with a 95-kilometer range, NATO's 
AWACS systems would be able to provide real-time information, 
and the 19 units deployed in the Atlantic would be able to take 
action immediately. 
  "At a purely national level," Fabbri adds, "we have improved 
our operational readiness levels, particularly in airports where 
allied aircraft are based. In addition, we have expanded our 
piloted interceptor aircraft alarm systems, and our Nike, Hawk, 
and Spada surface-to-air missile systems, which are deployed to 
defend the bases." 
  Fabbri goes on to write: "As regards, more specifically, the 
terrorist threat, which of course cannot be ruled out, 
surveillance measures have been strengthened in our airports and 
bases, in agreement with the interior minister." 
  Furthermore, Fabbri mentions that security has been 
tightened 
NATO air bases, and measures against the threat of a terrorist 
attack have also been taken. "We must be aware," the defense 
minister writes, "that, following the end of the Cold War, we 
are now living through crucial times for the future of mankind. 
The prestige of the United Nations, NATO, and the WEU [Western 
European Union] is at stake."

  [Excerpts] Copenhagen, Feb 15 (AFP) -- A unit of tanks that 
has been trying to reach UN troops in the Bosnian enclave of 
Tuzla for five months will not be diverted to Sarajevo, Danish 
Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said Tuesday [15 February]. 
  Speaking at a meeting with party leaders on the situation in 
the former Yugoslavia, Rasmussen said if the United Nations 
wanted to change its plans for the Danish Leopard tanks the 
question would have to be referred back to parliament here. 
[passage omitted] 
  Rasmussen said that in any event Sweden wanted the Danish 
troops in Tuzla so it could move some armoured troop carriers to 
Sarajevo. 
  The Leopards will first head for Tomislavgrad in southwest 
Bosnia, which is under the control of Bosnian Croat militia. 
  Rasmussen said he expected that the Croats would let the 
tanks through.

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, arrived tonight to participate in the 
proximity talks scheduled to begin on 17 February and said the 
Cyprus issue has reached a new, very serious phase. He added 
that progress has been achieved and if we continue in the same 
manner, we can deal with the substance of the issue and make 
progress. 
  Before making his statement, Clark met briefly with UN 
envoys 
Gustave Feissel and John Paul Kavanagh. In his statement, Clark 
reiterated that the international community is satisfied that 
both sides have shown goodwill, adding that interest has been 
expressed on the higher levels of the international community. 
  Answering a question, Clark said he can give assurances that 
implementation of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] will 
not constitute a Cyprus solution. He added that the CBM's are 
the principle that will lead to an appropriate climate to 
discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue. Answering another 
question, Clark said he disagrees with the view that the CBM's 
are destructive, adding that his mission is to promote a 
procedure that is supported by the United Nations. 
  Clark said it is important to achieve progress by the end of 
February, when the UN secretary general will submit his report, 
so that the UN Security Council can evaluate the whole issue.

  [Text] Ankara, Feb 15 (A.A) -- Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
on Tuesday [15 February] said that the decision by NATO was the 
most realistic and serious among those taken until now. 
  Addressing the DYP [True Path Party] party meeting, she said 
that during her visit to Bosnia on Feb 2 with Pakistan's Premier 
Benazir Bhutto, she has seen the naked thruth of the situation. 
  Ciller said it is essential that the people living there 
should be protected and the massacre ended, either by lifting 
the embargo or by air operation. 
  "Turkey is ready to do every thing to help implement NATO 
decision and to end this targedy which is taking place right in 
the center of Europe," she added. 
  NATO agreed on Feb 9 to order air strikes against Bosnian 
Serb forces besieging Sarajevo unless they withdraw artillery 
and other weapons or put them under UN control within 10 days. 
  The 16 NATO member anbassadors agreed at a meeting in 
Brussels that there would be no extension of the ultimatum and 
no further warnings. 
  Serb heavy weapons would have to be withdrawn at least 20 km 
(12 miles) from the centre of the besieged city, where 68 
helpless civilians were massacred and 200 wounded on Saturday 
when Serb mortar turned a market place in central Sarajevo into 
a pool of blood.

  [Text] Hamburg, Germany, Feb 16 (AFP) -- UN Secretary 
General Botrus Butrus-Ghali has said he "would not hesitate a 
moment" to implement Security Council decisions for air strikes 
against Serb artillery around Sarajevo. 
  In an interview with DIE WOCHE magazine made available 
Wednesday [16 February], Butrus-Ghali said: "If NATO gives me a 
mandate, I can deal with it straight away, as I already have a 
UN mandate." 
  However, he said that "who exactly gives the green light for 
air strikes" was not yet fixed. 
  The magazine said that the bulk of the interview was 
conducted last week in Brussels, but it confirmed details with 
Butrus-Ghali on Monday and Tuesday -- which was when the 
Security Council met on the air strikes question. 
  The secretary general said the UN welcomed NATO's February 9 
decision to mount airstrikes against Serb artillery if it were 
not withdrawn to 20 kilometres from Sarajevo city centre or put 
under UN control within 10 days. 
  According to Butrus-Ghali, the UN had helped bring about the 
decision. "We confronted NATO with its responsibilities and 
contributed to its new decisive attitude," he said. 
  In the interview, the secretary general was asked if air 
strikes could fail to take place because of Russian opposition. 
  He replied that some Security Council members such as Russia 
had their own interpretation of certain resolutions, seeing a 
distinction between air support and air strikes. 
  For the moment, he added, the Russian Federation shared the 
aims of the United States, the European Community, and the UN 
and was playing an active role in the Geneva talks between the 
warring parties of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Asked if a lifting of the arms embargo might be more 
effective than the threat of air strikes, he said any such 
decision would be for the Security Council to take and so far it 
had rejected this. 
  Asked his own position on the question, Butrus-Ghali said he 
would follow the decision of the Council. "I believe the 
Security Council must assume the responsibility for such an 
undertaking," he said. 
  He said the UN had not yet established responsibility for 
the 
shell which exploded in a Sarajevo market on February 6, killing 
68 people and wounding nearly 200, and prompting the NATO air 
strikes decision. 
  Asked who he believed was mainly responsibility for the 
continuation of the war in Bosnia, the secretary general blamed 
not only the warring parties but also UN member states which 
failed to respond to appeals to send more troops. 
  He primarily blamed the warring parties "but also the 
international community which is not making the necessary 
efforts to find a solution."

<F P=106> [Interview with British General Michael Rose, commander of </F>
the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, by Luca Poggiali in 
Sarajevo; date not given -- first paragraph is L'INDIPENDENTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Sarajevo -- "Technically speaking, we could define 
it as being an unprotected vehicle." General Michael Rose, 
commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, jokes about 
my means of transportation in Sarajevo. It is a bicycle and is 
ideal for moving around quickly. The man who will bear most of 
the responsibility of deciding whether to launch the NATO air 
strikes, came to greet me personally at the entrance to UN 
headquarters. Rose is courteous but determined as a result of 
the years spent in the special British forces. Born in 1940 in 
Quetta, now in Pakistan, he began his military career at an 
early age with the paratroopers. His curriculum includes 
numerous assignments in the Middle East and the Far East, in 
Northern Ireland, and at the command of the 22nd Special Air 
Force Regiment, which he led to reconquer the Falklands/Malvinas 
in 1982. 
  [Poggiali] Are you concerned about this new mission, 
General? 
  [Rose] It is indeed a delicate and complex mission. It is 
not a matter of defeating an adversary, but of preventing the 
continuation of the war and a downturn in the situation. Our 
strategy will be mapped out by the Security Council resolutions, 
and we must closely abide by its instructions. 
  [Poggiali] But almost none of the contenders seems to want 
to 
respect the resolutions. 
  [Rose] After two years of war, the conflicting parties are 
extremely suspicious of one another, and it is our duty to do 
all that we can to open talks. 
  [Poggiali] A few days ago you threatened to sweep away the 
Bosnian Serbs' roadblock on the way to the airport yourselves. 
This is a change in style compared to the previous UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] attitude. 
  [Rose] Unfortunately, we must deal with a large number of 
extremists who are trying to impose their will. We are also 
here to put a stop to such situations and, if obliged to do so, 
are also ready to resort to weapons. These are drastic 
decisions but nobody should doubt our will to bring to 
conclusion the mission with which we have been entrusted. Some 
of the best soldiers in the world are under my command, and we 
are also taking steps to strengthen the contingent: For 
example, the first tanks at the disposal of this mission, the 
Leopard tanks, are scheduled to arrive soon. 
  [Poggiali] The contingent is scattered over most of Bosnia; 
some of your divisions are isolated and could be the object of 
Serbian reprisals in case of an air strike. 
  [Rose] Obviously we have elaborated plans for any type of 
eventuality. On our side we know that we can count on a 
formidable air capacity and on the possibility of performing 
airborne operations, both because of the mobility of the units 
and the quick dispatch of reinforcements. The last person to 
challenge the United Nations, Saddam Husayn, was severely 
punished; therefore it would be better if everybody abided by 
the United Nations' desires.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Franco Angioni, commander of NATO </F>
ground forces in southern Europe, by Toni Fontana in Verona; 
date not given: "Angioni: `Peace Cannot Be Imposed at 
Gunpoint'"] 
  [Text] [Fontana] General, is Sarajevo another Beirut? 
  [Angioni] The comparison is not entirely unfounded. There 
are similarities and differences. The real difference is that 
Lebanon had become ungovernable owing to the large number of 
external "sponsors" that made negotiations impossible. So far, 
strife in the former Yugoslavia has been restricted to the 
communities present in the territory concerned; it is important 
that mediation should continue and that it should remain a 
matter for the parties directly involved. Sponsoring by 
third-party nations must be avoided, because if they were to 
become involved the war would spread and make the pursuit of a 
solution even more complicated. 
  [Fontana] NATO orders the Serbs to stop, and they react with 
threats against Italy. 
  [Angioni] Every war takes place at various levels: There is 
psychological warfare, determent, and political, economic, and 
then military pressure. No threat should be underestimated. 
That would be presumptuous. Attacks can be made with 
artillery, missiles, and aircraft. As far as we know, there are 
no artillery weapons with sufficient range to reach Italy, no 
missiles or rockets, as far as NATO is aware, and the Serbs have 
not been given missiles with a range exceeding the 200 
kilometers that separate the Italian coast from Serb territory. 
  [Fontana] What would be the risk to the population in the 
event of a NATO strike on the Serb positions? 
  [Angioni] NATO has already cleared the potential forms of 
intervention with the United Nations. Two forms of action are 
technically possible: One is to provide direct air support for 
the UN troops if they come under heavy fire. The procedure 
would be for the commander of the UN troops in Bosnia to apply 
to the permanent representative of the UN Secretary General, who 
would then ask the commander of the allied forces for southern 
Europe, who is empowered to order strikes on identified targets 
making direct offensives against the blue helmets, to intervene. 
The second form of intervention would consist of destroying 
weapon systems attacking the civilian population or the blue 
helmets. This scenario also contemplates strikes against the 
artillery surrounding Sarajevo, and this could happen when the 
ultimatum expires. 
  [Fontana] And will the population be exposed to risk? 
  [Angioni] NATO has taken account of the real aspects and 
those that serve as propaganda; it is aware that artillery is 
unlikely to be found in completely unpopulated areas. NATO has 
the "physical representation" of the lie of the land at its 
disposal, and there are photographs, etc. It must be borne in 
mind that these are mobile targets, and that our information 
must be updated constantly. The artillery posts can be moved in 
less than 24 hours. Our updates must be increasingly accurate 
as the ultimatum approaches zero hour. NATO will not strike if 
the risk is too great, but the possibility that the artillery 
may be positioned in or near residential areas gives rise to 
great concern. The pilot's orders and skill must reduce the 
risk to the absolute minimum. 
  [Fontana] The raid could trigger the entry of other powers 
into the war, Russia in particular. 
  [Angioni] Scenarios change rapidly. The UN resolution was 
passed by the Security Council, on which Russia has a seat as 
well, but Russia is against the eventuality of more substantial 
strikes. Moreover, it is impossible to ignore the reaction of 
public opinion, and the "automatic" involvement of certain 
nations must not be forgotten. 
  [Fontana] Do you believe in the theory of "surgical 
bombing"? 
  [Angioni] Those who believe in it on the basis of the Gulf 
war make two mistakes. Firstly, it is misleading to think that 
the same situation is repeating itself, and secondly, it is 
wrong to think that air strikes alone can put the situation 
right. 
  [Fontana] There is talk of 500 guns surrounding Sarajevo. 
  [Angioni] Some information is secret, but 500 guns may seem 
a 
lot. What matters is the "quality" of these guns. This 
category is often taken to include weapons that are not guns but 
mortars or howitzers. The most dangerous guns in the Serbs' 
possession are Russian-made, the "130's," which have a range of 
about 30 kilometers. All the others have a shorter range, and 
cannot strike from a distance greater than 10 kilometers. 
  [Fontana] Second scenario: massive intervention by a 
peacekeeping force. How many troops would be needed? 
  [Angioni] A peacekeeping army can only act in a context of 
support for peacekeeping operations, and if a settlement has 
already been reached, otherwise it becomes a euphemism for 
making war. In this case, too, the precedent provided by the 
Gulf war is misleading, because the distribution of three armies 
across the whole of Bosnia means that we cannot advance like a 
steamroller. The parties at war must reach a settlement whereby 
they can be separated and some form of justice can be restored. 
We must not allow emotion to interfere with a political and 
military solution, which must be approached with detachment and 
clear-sightedness. Unless the parties at war reach a settlement, 
the UN and NATO operation could well achieve nothing. Indeed, 
we must stand up and say that if blame is to be apportioned in 
Yugoslavia, it should not be laid at the door of those who will 
not or cannot intervene, but primarily of those who refuse to 
reach a settlement. 
  [Fontana] So you regard intervention by ground troops to 
impose peace as unlikely? 
  [Angioni] Highly unlikely, practically out of the question 
if 
you consider the numbers involved: 100,000 Serbs in Bosnia, 
50,000 Croatians, all armed and determined to pursue their 
goals, 50,000 Muslims. Confronting and overcoming such massive 
forces would require a military organization large enough not to 
risk defeat or, what would be worse, prolonging the war. The 
numerical ratio in the field must be one to three, or probably 
five or more. If the forces to be confronted number 200,000, 
how many armies would it take? 
  [Fontana] There would be a large number of casualties. What 
if the factions reach agreement? 
  [Angioni] The issue is a political one. What would be the 
purpose of intervening? To establish the cantons contemplated 
in the latest peace plan? And for how long? These are 
questions requiring answers in political terms. Once it has 
these answers, the military organization can intervene to "keep 
down" the violence. But if this process does not begin, asking 
for a military presence, as an end in itself, in the hope of 
reducing the risk to human lives is completely unrealistic. The 
risks would increase, we would be providing more "hostages." 
  [Fontana] So you place greater faith in the arms of 
diplomacy 
than in the arms of warfare? 
  [Angioni] Yes, definitely. My experience has led me to 
believe that peace cannot be imposed at gunpoint. It would be a 
peace imposed with proclamations and notices posted on walls. 
Peace is a conquest made day after day, and it belongs to those 
who will benefit from it, the "consumers." Armies are not in a 
position to impose peace; they are there to help implement 
political decisions, and they need technical objectives to 
achieve in a strictly defined timeframe pursuant to political 
objectives. If the expiry of the ultimatum is followed by 
intervention, it will merely be the consequence of that 
political decision. If they do not withdraw the artillery, 
there must be intervention. Nothing is happening for the time 
being because the ultimatum, too, is a deterrent, and this is 
where the political decision is so finely balanced: Should we 
lose political face and credit by not intervening if the 
ultimatum is not complied with, or intervene on a limited, 
selective scale to show that we mean what we say? It is a 
psychological balancing act.

  [Text] Brussels, February 16 (TANJUG) -- Greek request for 
a special session of the European Union (E.U.) Ministerial 
Council devoted to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has not yet 
arrived to the E.U., said a E.U. spokesman. 
  Asked at a news conference in Brussels by TANJUG's 
correspondent whether such a meeting would be held, he replied 
that the E.U. was prepared to undertake adequate steps so as to 
meet Athens's wish, but that, at least as regards the official 
aspect, such a request has not come in yet. 
  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias announced Tuesday 
[15 February] his country would demand an urgent meeting of the 
E.U. Ministerial Council to discuss the Bosnia crisis. 
Papoulias met in Belgrade with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. 
  Feverish diplomatic activity in connection with Bosnia was 
marked Wednesday in Brussels by a testimony of co-chairman of 
the conference on former Yugoslavia David Owen behind closed 
doors in the Foreign Affairs and Security Commission of the 
European Parliament [EP]. 
  According to well-informed sources, Owen has in an 
optimistically intoned report stated the hope that everything 
could end without military escalation. If this was to be done, 
in his view, it was necessary to withdraw the Serb weapons 
around Sarajevo, parallel with demilitarization of the city. 
This would immediately be followed by demilitarization of 
Mostar, as an introduction to a general peace agreement on 
Bosnia. 
  This agreement, in his view, would be based possibly only 
partly on the changed plan of the European Union which envisaged 
transformation of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina into a union of states of the three warring 
peoples -- the Serbs, Muslems and Croats. 
  The Serb and Muslem forces clashed around Sarajevo, while 
Muslems and Croats clashed around Mostar. 
  According to the same source, Owen warned the international 
community it must take into consideration the factor Russia, but 
also warn the Serbs that they could not expect unconditional 
support from Russia. 
  The European Parliament commission, as its president Baron 
Crespo told TANJUG, accepted Owen's assessments and proposals as 
the sole realistic basis to attain peace in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Interview with IAEA spokesman David Kyd by Katinka Novotny; </F>
place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Novotny] After 10 rounds of talks between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea last 
year, North Korea finally showed flexibility and agreed to allow 
the inspection of part of its nuclear facilities. Why are these 
inspections so important, and what information do you expect to 
obtain on North Korea's nuclear program? 
  [Kyd] First of all, it is very important for us to be able 
to carry out another inspection. After one year of absence, it 
is urgently necessary and high time to resume activities in 
North Korea. For us it is important to find out whether North 
Korea has produced or otherwise obtained plutonium for military 
or other purposes in the past 12 months. This is the main goal 
of our inspection. We also want to make preparations so that 
additional inspections can take place in the future. 
  [Novotny] What are your suspicions? Do you believe that 
North Korea is in the process of building an atomic bomb or that 
it even possesses one? 
  [Kyd] This is not our task. Our task is to find out how 
much plutonium has been produced, how much plutonium Korea 
possesses, and whether the amount would be sufficient to build a 
bomb. We are not the political rulers. We are the police, as 
it were. We can carry out investigations, however the 
politicians have to assess them. 
  [Novotny] The regime in Pyongyang has always been very 
imaginative in covering up and concealing the existence of its 
secret facilities. How useful are inspections if two secret 
nuclear plants where the atomic bomb might be built cannot be 
inspected? 
  [Kyd] Well, you must understand that one cannot expect to be 
granted everything at once if one wants to resume activities 
after 12 months. Otherwise another year might pass before an 
agreement is concluded. We now have reached an agreement with 
North Korea, and we can continue our work. Yet if we had 
demanded everything at once, then it would have been impossible 
to return to North Korea, particularly because we know that 
officials there refused access to these two plants in the past. 
Our inspection is an initial step. The path ahead will be very 
long and very tough. Thus, our mission is only an initial 
phase, but a very important one that is absolutely necessary.

<F P=106> [Report by Ingrid Steiner: "North Korea's Pawn Continues To </F>
Be Well Hidden"] 
  [Excerpt] When the delegation of experts of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspect the North 
Korean nuclear facilities on Yongbon, every step will be 
carefully observed. They will not be allowed to deviate a 
single inch from the determined route or take a closer look at 
an earth mound or a tree at the giant plant. The strictly 
communist North Korea will not allow any inspections of the site 
where the IAEA expects underground secret nuclear plants to be 
located. 
  "We know that the two plants exist," IAEA spokesman David 
Kyd 
told KURIER. "They are clearly recognized on satellite 
pictures. They are located right in the center of the Yongbon 
site." 
  However, North Korea categorically denies everything. The 
plants in question are merely "military facilities." 
  In the seven declared nuclear plants where the IAEA will be 
granted access, North Korea cannot build an "atomic bomb"; it 
can only produce fissile material. "North Korea started its 
nuclear program 20 years ago. We are absolutely certain that it 
possesses more plutonium than Pyongyang admits," Kyd stressed. 
Only 5-8 kg are needed to produce a single atomic bomb. 
  According to Kyd, only the United States can exert the 
required pressure needed to ensure the inspection of the two 
secret plants. "The IAEA does not have any instruments; only 
Washington has something to offer" -- that is economic aid for 
extremely poor North Korea or the U.S. promise to renounce the 
large-scale maneuver, planned together with South Korea.

<F P=106> [Helmut Hetzel report: "Europol Starts Work in The Hague"] </F>
  [Text] The Hague -- Europol, the predecessor of a future 
European investigative and police organization, was inaugurated 
yesterday in The Hague by Dutch Justice Minister Ernst 
Hirsch-Ballin and Interior Minister Ed van Thijn. Hirsch-Ballin 
thanked Germany in particular for the initiative to establish 
Europol. The initiative was initiated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
a few years ago. 
  However, in an interview with DIE WELT, Europol chief 
Juergen 
Storbeck (47) points out that Europol is still in the process of 
being established. However, the new authority "already 
functions as an information and data exchange for the 12 
European Union members," stresses Storbeck, who was a former 
head of the Organized Crime Department in the Federal Office of 
Criminal Investigations in Wiesbaden. This is particularly 
important and helpful for combating organized drug trafficking. 
However, it is still unclear whether Europol will, some day, 
also have executive powers. 
  In the long run, Europol can develop into a real European 
investigative body, as is set down in the Maastricht Treaty, if 
the European Union members agree. 
  Question to Storbeck: What can Europol/EDU (drug authority) 
really do? Storbeck: "If, for instance, the Hamburg police 
want information about a person who is wanted in Europe, it can 
get this information from us within an hour. In the past, 
something like that took days." In addition, Europol is 
analyzing the development and trends of crime with the help of a 
computer network, which is already working all over the European 
Union. "Through this intensive European exchange of data, we 
can, for instance, see when the Balkan route in drug trafficking 
is shifting and we can tell our colleagues in the individual 
countries affected so that corresponding countermeasures can be 
taken," Storbeck says. "Or we can inform the respective 
national police authorities, such as the Federal Office of 
Criminal Investigations, about the emergence of new 
international criminal gangs."

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Johnson: "Europe Faces Split Over </F>
Immigrant Workers"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The EC Commission is heading for a 
clash with Britain over plans to allow the nine million legally 
established immigrants within Europe the right to move and work 
freely across the continent. 
  Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, will today 
unveil 
an audacious plan designed both to crack down on illegal 
immigrants and to give those already in Europe "a stake in 
society," EC officials said last night. 
  The commissioner, a former Fianna Fail justice minister in 
Ireland, will propose that legally established immigrants in 
other EC countries should have the right to seek employment in 
Britain, even if they do not have an EC passport. 
  The 34-point plan is likely to appall Tory backbenchers. At 
last year's Tory Party conference, Peter Lilley, Social Security 
Secretary, drew cheers with an attack on "benefit tourists" from 
other EC countries, and the notion of throwing open the doors to 
non-EC citizens is already being dismissed in London. 
  Britain's immigration laws still tightly restrict entry to 
those doing necessary jobs, or those having spouses or dependent 
children already resident in Britain. Any legally established 
immigrant can apply for citizenship after four years. 
  Germany, too, is likely to object to Mr Flynn's plan for a 
gradual naturalisation of "gastarbeiters," such as the Turks who 
can remain in Germany for generations without being entitled 
either to nationality or to the vote. Last night, details of 
the plan, which involves extensive use of dual nationality, were 
still being negotiated with the German commissioners, Peter 
Schmidhuber and Martin Bangemann. 
  Mr Flynn's far-reaching programme involves spending EC cash 
on fighting discrimination, and improving housing, education and 
training for immigrants. 
  It appears to make a nonsense of the Government's constant 
claim that Maastricht's "pillar" structure has served to 
decentralise decision-taking in Brussels. 
  One EC source pointed out that before the Treaty came into 
force on Nov 1, the 12 interior and justice ministers held 
informal deliberations in remote locations across the Community, 
without facing a stream of proposals and directives from the 
Commission, let alone the scrutiny of the Euro-parliament. 
  "Now you can have the Commission at the table," said a 
source. 
  When the Flynn proposals come before Mr Howard and other 
interior ministers this spring, governments are likely to be 
much more enthusiastic about the parallel measures to keep 
illegal immigrants out. 
  These include fines for those who employ them, as in the 
American system, and special clauses to be written into trade 
and aid agreements with the countries of emigration, stipulating 
that they should play their part in restraining the exodus.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Hubert </F>
Wachter; place and date not given: "National Socialist Elements 
Belong to His Program"] 
  [Text] [Wachter] Chancellor Vranitzky, election year 1994 
will probably boil down to a duel between you and the leader of 
the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], Joerg Haider. Haider 
claims to be the "secret chancellor" already, because your 
government is only carrying out what he has always demanded. 
  [Vranitzky] I am amused by his glib remarks. Is he the 
secret chancellor? I do not know and I do not care what Haider 
does secretly. Yet those who are secretly great people usually 
collect tin soldiers or sail boats in the bath tub. The truth is 
Haider is a traditional politician. He has been telling the 
same old story for many years. He has simply not broken with 
the right-wing fringe. He has not even been able to give up 
certain National Socialist elements, like the "employment policy 
of the Third Reich." There are people who say that this is his 
problem. I claim this is not his problem but his program! 
  [Wachter] Haider has accused the government of adopting 
political measures on the immigration issue that he has been 
proposing for a long time. 
  [Vranitzky] By deluding us about his goals, he has 
repeatedly adopted anti-immigrant positions. If he says that we 
must slowly send the guest workers home to create more work for 
Austrians, his proposal is either not well thought out, or he is 
not familiar with the employment situation. Let me give you an 
example: If a factory exports its goods mainly to East Europe, 
and if the systems are collapsing in Russian and Ukraine so that 
we can no longer sell anything there, he will still not sell 
anything even if he sends 20,000 workers home. 
  [Wachter] Haider has stated scornfully that he wants to take 
over your job in 1998, hinting that you are no longer very 
active. He described himself as the chancellor for the next 
millennium. 
  [Vranitzky] Well, this is the third element of his story. 
He is constantly talking about becoming chancellor -- always 
with a certain delay, as in a poorly dubbed film. He first 
wanted to become chancellor in 1990 when he nominated the 
unfortunate Norbert Gugerbauer as head of the FPOe. Now he 
wants to become chancellor again -- but not before 1998. Thus, 
he was defeated twice on the issue of chancellor. 
  [Wachter] You pushed Haider out to the margin of politics in 
1986. 
  [Vranitzky] I did not do that. I merely distanced myself 
from him. 
  [Wachter] Okay, you distanced yourself. What went wrong as 
far as the political strategy is concerned, if Joerg Haider, 
from whom you distanced yourself, is now your strongest rival 
and challenger? 
  [Vranitzky] Nothing went wrong. Quite the contrary. Day in 
and day out, he proves that the distancing was necessary and 
that I made the right decision in 1986. 
  [Wachter] Haider wants to focus on the immigration issue in 
the election year. 
  [Vranitzky] After the letter-bomb attacks, all five party 
chairmen agreed to observe a 12-point list concerning language 
and political culture. The goal was to prevent extreme forms of 
political debate. Haider was one of the first to break the 
rules. Thus, one can hardly expect him to observe a high 
standard of politics. Yet only naive people will be surprised 
about that. 
  [Wachter] The election campaign will probably be dominated 
by "social liberality" versus "the cult of personality and a 
society where one succeeds by elbow-jostling." 
  [Vranitzky] Yes, exactly. We will stress our efforts to 
safeguard Austria's attractiveness as a business location, 
particularly our endeavors to ensure full employment. 
  [Wachter] At 300,000 unemployed? 
  [Vranitzky] Well, particularly at a time when unemployment 
is rising, we must strongly reject elbow-jostling. Social 
scientists discovered a long time ago that there are people in 
society who are losers or who consider themselves to be losers. 
Haider's strategy is to address these people. We will tell 
them clearly: We understand that you are susceptible to 
arguments from this corner. Yet do you understand that you will 
not be offered a solution from there, that your incomes will not 
be increased, that there will be no social improvement, and that 
jobs will not become safer. 
  [Wachter] Let us talk about the elections. Will we go to 
the polls in June? 
  [Vranitzky] No, there are no such plans whatsoever. 
  [Wachter] The Austrian People's Party [OeVP] has hinted it 
wants to leave the government and go into opposition if its gap 
with the Socialist Party of Austria should increase (10 percent 
difference in 1990). What would this mean for you? 
  [Vranitzky] Nothing for the time being. The OeVP will 
continue to be our coalition partner until the elections. Then 
talks will be held. By the way, the OeVP has never officially 
announced it plans to go into opposition. There are only voices 
within the party who advocate such a step. The OeVP will have 
to think about that and make a decision. 
  [Wachter] At what "red" intensive care unit will the "black" 
patient be treated after the elections to keep it alive? 
  [Vranitzky] One cannot wage an election campaign for two 
parties at the same time. 
  [Wachter] Are you worried about the position of the OeVP? 
  [Vranitzky] I do not want to give advice or recommend 
anything to a coalition partner through the media. As the 
federal government and as parties, we must do two things: We 
must prove we are able to do our job and we must be acceptable 
to the voters. 
  [Wachter] If the OeVP should no longer be wiling to form a 
coalition with you, you can only cooperate with the Liberal 
Forum or the Greens, or with both. There have been reports you 
would consider such a constellation too unstable, that you would 
not be willing to lead such a coalition, and you would withdraw 
from politics. 
  [Vranitzky] Negotiations on the future government will be 
held after the elections. I will not comment on this issue now.

<F P=106> [Report by Heinz Peter Ziegler] </F>
  [Text] Modelled on the famous Ash Wednesday meetings by 
former Bavarian Minister President Franz-Josef Strauss, Joerg 
Haider, Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] chairman, gets even with 
his political opponents in the Jahn assembly hall at Ried im 
Innkreis, surrounded by beer mugs and pretzels. He says he has 
again come to Ried this year in spite of being very busy with 
election campaigns for three provincial government elections. 
And he gets down to business immediately. 
  [Begin Haider recording] Of course, the Austrian People's 
Party and Social Democratic Party of Austria are top in opinion 
polls. But the elections have always been won by us, and this 
will also be the case on 13 March. [end recording] 
  Haider also knows how he wants to win the elections. The 
state, which has been ruined by the governing parties, must be 
reorganized without taking anything away from hard working 
people. This could be done by cutting bureaucracy, reforming 
the social insurance system, and abolishing privileges for 
functionaries. 
  [Begin recording] I think it is the wrong policy to say we 
will secure our future social benefits by letting more 
foreigners enter the country; they are known to have more 
children than Austrians, and they will finance our social 
benefits. I have a different opinion. We need fewer foreigners 
and a sensible family policy so Austrians can afford children 
and it is not a question of money whether we have children or 
not. [end recording] 
  Haider also demands self-confidence for Austria's European 
Union [EU] accession talks. He says the government has 
submitted a declaration of capitulation in Brussels. 
  [Begin recording] Dr. Mock said we should enter the European 
Union quickly because the window to Brussels is open. To, so to 
speak, slip in through the window, then you are in, because it 
could close again. We have to tell him, we Austrians are 
self-confident enough to enter a house through the door. 
Whoever wants to get us in through the window will not get us 
in. Either they open the door properly, in which case we will 
enter if we want to, or we will stay out. [end recording] 
  Another issue that is topical for Haider on Ash Wednesday is 
that of the letter-bomb attacks. He rejects any link between 
the FPOe and the attacks. And he suspects that those who are to 
blame are to be found in a different political camp. A 
confidant of the state police is behind bars as a suspect. And 
another was arrested in the apartment of a well-known socialist 
functionary in Vienna, Haider says.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Britain was tonight poised to send hundreds more 
troops to help strengthen the peacekeeping operation in the 
Bosnian capital Sarajevo. The United Nations appeal for up to 
3,000 more troops will be high on the agenda when the Cabinet 
meets tomorrow. And a ministerial announcement could be made as 
early as tomorrow afternoon in the House of Commons. The 
Government has been deeply reluctant to be sucked in even more 
into the bloody Bosnian civil war. It has emphasised Britain's 
already heavy commitment with 2,400 troops on the ground 
together with major contributions to the air and naval 
operations. And it has been urging other UN countries to 
provide forces and share the load. 
  But there was reluctant recognition in Whitehall tonight 
that 
Britain cannot be seen to fail when success appears so close, 
particularly as the man behind the six-day Sarajevo ceasefire -- 
Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose -- is British. 
  "We would be lepers in the world community if we failed to 
reinforce what is a tremendous success," said one official. 
  "Here is a man creating some success for the first time in 
two years and he is a Brit to boot. It would be very difficult 
to hold up our heads if we did not send more forces." 
  It is understood the Government is seriously considering the 
deployment of an infantry battalion equipped with Saxon wheeled 
armoured personnel carriers and mortar locating radar 
specialists. Sources said troops from the Coldstream Guards 
based at Vitez in central Bosnia could be moved initially to 
Sarajevo to help the peacekeeping operation until new forces 
arrive. 
  The most likely infantry unit to be deployed is the Green 
Howards, based at Catterick in North Yorkshire and the old 
regiment of the current Chief of the General Staff, General Sir 
Peter Inge. The regiment, whose origins date back to 1689, is 
equipped with Saxon, a lightly armoured, manoeuvrable vehicle 
that is best described as a battlefield taxi. But the Army must 
decide whether the lightly armoured vehicles would be suitable 
for operations in Sarajevo. 
  The Royal Artillery's 94 Locating Radar based at Larkhill, 
Wiltshire, is also likely to be deployed along with some other 
artillery units. It is equipped with the Cymbeline mortar 
locating radar, which detects the flight of a mortar bomb at two 
points in the trajectory as it passes through radar beams. 
Rapid computing produces a grid reference to identify the 
firing point. However, it is 1970's technology and uses a large 
radar dish, that is very vulnerable to sniper and other attacks. 
It is also heavily manpower intensive because, as there is no 
automatic alert system, it must be manned continuously 24 hours 
a day. 
  However, there are grave doubts among a number of Tory MPs 
about Britain becoming even more embroiled in the Balkans 
bloodbath. Party officials believe they will have a lot of work 
to do to win all-round support for further deployments. 
  But Labour's shadow defence Secretary, Dr David Clark, 
strongly urged the Government to make extra troops available. 
"Labour believes that UN military commanders on the ground in 
Bosnia should be provided with very rapid reinforcements of 
ground troops if they believe these are required," he said. 
  UN officials said the extra troops were needed to buttress 
the truce, to try to demilitarise Sarajevo and even extend the 
process elsewhere in Bosnia. 
  Meanwhile, NATO and UN forces are continuing to prepare for 
possible airstrikes once the deadline for the Serbs to pull back 
or hand over their heavy weapons expires at midnight Sunday [20 
February]. 
  UN officials formally confirmed for the first time that 
allied forward air controllers were in Sarajevo. They will use 
a variety of sophisticated equipment, including 
laser-designators to pinpoint targets for allied warplanes. 
NATO ambassadors in Brussels said they would not extend the 
weapons deadline on the Bosnian Serbs who have been besieging 
Sarajevo for 22 months. There was still optimism among UN 
officials that the early stages of demilitarisation of the 
battered city was progressing well. 
  But the calm was briefly broken when a Serb sniper shot dead 
a Muslim civilian in the most serious violation of the ceasefire.

  [Text] The Government tonight awarded a 300 million pound 
contract for two military communications satellites. Defence 
Procurement Minister Jonathan Aitken said the Skynet 4 Stage 2 
satellites would replace the existing satellites as they 
approach the end of their operational life. They will become 
operational in 1998 and will be for the sole use of the UK's 
military forces. 
  British Aerospace is the prime contractor for the work. The 
main sub-contractors are Matra Marconi Space (UK) for the 
satellite communications equipment and U.S. giant McDonnell 
Douglas and Europe's Arianespace for the launch rockets. 
  "This is an important contract which will ensure the 
continued well-being of the UK's space industry and contribute 
to its long-term future," said Mr Aitken.

<F P=106> [Report by Lucy Plaskett, editor of EC ENERGY MONTHLY, a </F>
FINANCIAL TIMES newsletter: "East Europe Nuclear Plants Face 
Legal Delay on Repairs"] 
  [Text] West European nuclear companies are refusing to 
carry out urgent nuclear safety repair work in East Europe and 
the CIS until they have protection against liability in case of 
accidents. 
  Foratom, the European federation of nuclear trade 
associations, has written to Sir Leon Brittan, the European 
Union's [EU] external economic affairs commissioner, warning 
that unless Western nuclear companies are protected against 
legal action they will withdraw from nuclear repair work in the 
region. 
  The companies are concerned that they would be liable if 
there were an accident during work to repair or replace ailing 
Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. 
  The move will delay the flow of European Commission nuclear 
safety funds to the region under its technical assistance 
programmes. It will also prevent companies from signing large 
repair contracts under the Nuclear Safety Account, the 
multilateral aid fund set up by the Group of Seven 
industrialised countries after the July 1992 Munich summit. 
  International experts have identified a number of 
Soviet-designed reactors that are in urgent need of repair, in 
particular the first generation pressurised water reactors, the 
VVER 230s and the RBMK Chernobyl design. In December 1993 the 
EU's economic and finance commissioner Henning Christophersen 
described the nuclear safety situation as a "time bomb ticking 
away in East Europe". 
  While Western nuclear companies have been prepared to 
participate in studies and training at the plants, they will not 
replace equipment until they have legal protection against the 
consequences of accidents. 
  Most of the countries with VVER 230s and RBMK reactors in 
operation have not signed the 1963 Vienna Convention, which 
ensures that full responsibility for damages caused by accidents 
falls exclusively on plant operators. 
  The Commission has said it cannot guarantee to pay damages. 
Instead, it has asked countries receiving aid to sign bilateral 
agreements with nuclear companies protecting them against legal 
action. The nuclear industry argues that such deals do not give 
it sufficient legal or economic protection. 
  Foratom met Commission officials yesterday in the first of a 
series of meetings to find an interim solution which would allow 
vital safety work to go ahead. One option could be for 
recipient countries, West European governments and possibly the 
industry itself to set up a fund which could be tapped if an 
accident occurs.

<F P=106> [Article signed "ALN/JDD": "Claes Addresses Senate on NATO </F>
Ultimatum"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 16 Feb (BELGA) -- Deputy Prime Minister 
and Foreign Minister Willy Claes said the NATO message has been 
understood properly in Russia and Belgrade. He hoped therefore 
that a peace agreement which was acceptable to everyone and 
offered adequate guarantees for Bosnia would be possible. 
  The minister was questioned in Senate on the situation in 
Bosnia by De Donnea (PRL) [Liberal Reformation Party] and De 
Croo (VLD) [Flemish Liberal Democrats]. He called once again 
for the European Union to speak with one voice and said it 
should take the indispensable step of deciding its foreign 
policies by a federal method, rather than the current 
interministerial conferences at which any decision must be 
unanimous. 
  The minister also reiterated that NATO's decision to set an 
ultimatum for the withdrawal of heavy weapons around Sarajevo 
was an inevitable step. The peace process had reached an 
impasse and a new element was necessary. Claes saw the 
ultimatum as a "stimulus" to the peace negotiations. He also 
called for the ultimatum to be applied firmly. Thus he said he 
was in favor of a clear definition of what was expected exactly. 
  For the minister, an effective peace agreement has to 
involve 
all the parties on the ground, the EU, the United States, 
Russia, and the Islamic countries. As for Russia in particular, 
the minister recalled that this country had voted in favor of 
the Security Council resolutions which supported the NATO 
decision. He also said Russia should be actively involved in 
the peace negotiations in the interest of the regions concerned, 
and also in the interests of democratization in Russia. 
  Finally, Claes said Belgium should accept making additional 
efforts if NATO requested them.

<F P=106> [Article by Christopher Bellamy, defence correspondent: </F>
"Britain Ready To Back Ceasefire With More Troops"] 
  [Text] Britain would be prepared to provide more troops to 
help police the fragile ceasefire around Sarajevo, the commander 
of UK Land Forces indicated yesterday. But it would be for the 
United Nations to request such extra troops and, as Britain is 
already one of the two largest contributors to UN operations, 
sources said the UN might look to other countries first. 
  Plans for a complete shake-up of the UN command in Bosnia to 
help implement the more "muscular" approach advocated by the new 
UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, have 
resurfaced at the British headquarters in Split. 
  On extra British troops, all the Ministry of Defence would 
say yesterday was "a wide range of capabilities have been 
earmarked to reinforce British troops according to the 
situation." Because the situation is so uncertain, they are 
keeping their hand well covered. 
  Any extra troops sent would have to be trained in 
peace-keeping and monitoring, and might form a separate, larger 
force from the armoured infantry of the Royal Anglian Regiment, 
which is due to replace the Coldstream Guards group at Vitez 
within about two month's time. 
  The Royal Anglian battalion group could not be used as a 
monitoring force as it would interrupt the changeover with the 
Guards, and forces of a different type are required. Under the 
shake-up being studied in Split, the command of UN forces would 
become more like that of a normal military operation. which, if 
the UN gets tough, might be necessary. 
  The plan to introduce two intermediate commands, one 
possibly 
run by the British, the other perhaps by the French, was first 
mooted a year ago and re-emerged after General Rose's arrival 
nearly three weeks ago. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina command (BHC), based at Kiseljak and with 
a forward headquarters in Sarajevo, controls many UN battalions, 
each of which operates in a self-contained fashion. In a normal 
military operation, it would have an impossible "span of 
control." And with the arrival of more battalions -- a 
Malaysian battalion which will operate from Jablanica and a 
Nordic battalion, with three companies of Swedes and one of 
Danes, now mostly in place at Tuzla --it will get worse. 
  Under General Rose's "three-star," or corps-level, command, 
two new, brigade-level, "one-star" headquarters would be set up. 
The British would be ideally suited to command BHC south. They 
already have a brigadier, paratrooper John Reith, at Split in 
charge of the route from the sea, but he shares command of the 
British battalion with the UN headquarters at Kiseljak which 
gives the operational orders. He might take command of the 
Malaysian and Spanish battalions as well as the British, 
becoming an international operational commander answering to 
Kiseljak. 
  The northern command might go to the French. They have the 
largest contingent in the former Yugoslavia, some 6,000 troops, 
many in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The French brigadier-general would 
control French, Canadian and Nordic battalions. 
  Such a profound change could mean the British headquarters, 
moving up country from Split so it can take a more direct 
command role. Sources stress that the creation of the new BHC 
north and south commands is only an option, but it would be 
logical if UN forces were expanded in numbers, if the UN became 
more actively involved in peace-keeping, or if air strikes took 
place and the UN became the fourth party in the war.

<F P=106> [Donald Macintyre report: "Britain To Consider Need for </F>
Hi-Tech Anti-Missile Defense"] 
  [Text] Britain is considering whether to adopt a defence 
system which could protect the country and its forces from 
missile attack in the way that the Patriot system protected the 
allies from Iraqi Scuds during the Gulf war. 
  Malcolm Rifkind, the Secretary of State for Defence, 
revealed 
yesterday that he was commissioning a two-year study to decide 
whether to develop a hi-tech, anti-ballistic missile defence 
network as part of a continuing re-evaluation of the country's 
defence needs. 
  Although the Government decided last year to halt plans for 
a 
1bn pound medium-range missile system for the Royal Air Force, 
Mr Rifkind said that "in the face of proliferation round the 
world" the Government "was considering whether there might be a 
need for a defence system in the future." 
  Defence experts do not rule out the possibility that, within 
the next decade, unpredictable countries like Libya could have a 
ballistic missile system that would put Britain within range. 
  Mr Rifkind told the Centre for Defence Studies in London: 
"We are looking with our allies at potential risks both to the 
UK and to our forces deployed overseas, and all possible means 
of countering them." He added: "Conflict is not always, 
perhaps not even often, inspired by cold rational judgement. We 
cannot predict the scenarios which may unfold, or who our 
opponents might be. But it is clear that we need to maintain a 
capability to take military action." 
  The U.S. is also developing systems with a longer range than 
Patriot's, such as Lockheed's Theatre High Altitude Air Defence 
(Thaad) systems. Mr Rifkind emphasised that warfare at all 
levels was becoming "much more technologically sophisticated." 
  He also confirmed yesterday that the MoD [Ministry of 
Defense] is considering whether to acquire conventionally armed 
cruise missiles. 
  The Royal Navy is known to be keen to have 
submarine-launched 
cruise missiles. 
  And in a another move which will be warmly welcomed by the 
Royal Navy, Mr Rifkind identified the aircraft carrier, 
amphibious forces and equipment, and the nuclear submarine as 
central to Britain's maritime strategy. 
  He also underlined the continuing need for tanks, attack 
helicopters, and an advanced fighter, such as the Eurofighter 
2OOO. 
  Mr Rifkind added: "Prudence and caution oblige me to accept 
that it is entirely conceivable that, before the end of the 
decade, the West will find a number of different circumstances 
arising where it must take military action. 
  "It could also find it necessary to protect and evacuate 
civilians caught up in a conflict. And it is more than likely 
that we will be asked by the UN or the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe to undertake new peace support 
missions." 
  Mr Rifkind did not suggest that an anti-missile system 
might, 
in the long term, coincide with a reduction in the UK's 
deterrent capability. But he cited "the five principle choices 
which bear Britain's defence capabilities" -- the decision to 
deploy an independent nuclear deterrent; the choice of 
collective security; tbe responsibility for 14 dependent 
territories; support for the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] in 
Northern Ireland; and active commitment to the UN and collective 
global security. 
  The Secretary of State added: "We have to ensure that we 
design military units to make a useful contribution to 
operations of all kinds. But we have always made clear that we 
do not necessarily need to plan to have all capabilities within 
our armed forces."

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Ministry of Defense: </F>
"Rifkind Signs Defence Agreement With Sweden"] 
  [Text] A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed today 
in Stockholm by Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, 
and his Swedish counterpart Mr Andres Bjork. 
  The MOU will provide the framework for discussions on 
equipment collaboration and co-operation. Industry will play a 
key role in fulfilling the opportunities offered by the MOU and 
the Ministry of Defence will explore the scope of co-operation 
by investigating defence procurement requirements. 
  The MOU will build upon previous contact between British and 
Swedish Industry and discussions continue between British 
Aerospace and SAAB concerning further development and export of 
JAS 39 light combat aircraft. There may also be opportunities 
for joint development of a new generation medium range air to 
air missile for the Eurofighter 2000 and JAS 39 Grippen as well 
as for subsequent export. 
<H5>  Mr Rifkind said: </H5>
  "This is a very positive step and a number of defence 
requirements which contain areas of similarity are currently 
being considered. There may be more and what this initiative 
will require is innovative action by our respective industries 
to pursue and fully exploit the opportunities offered."

<F P=106> [Speech by Sir Robert Butler, head of the Home Civil </F>
Service: "Statement by Sir Butler To the Inquiry Into Exports of 
Defence Equipment and Dual Use Goods To Iraq"] 
  [Text] "I would like to make a brief statement to the 
Inquiry as Head of the Home Civil Service. I have consulted Sir 
David Gillmore, Head of the Diplomatic Service, who wishes to 
associate himself with my remarks. In accordance with the 
Inquiry's wishes, I have given the Inquiry an advance copy of 
this statement. 
  "In the course of this Inquiry, officials from the Home 
Civil 
Service and Diplomatic Service have provided you with a vast 
amount of evidence and testimony, both written and oral, on the 
matters under investigation. Of those who have provided either 
written or oral testimony, or both, many if not most have moved 
on to new posts and responsibilities since their involvement in 
the matters now under investigation, and their co-operation with 
the Inquiry has been a major additional burden for them to carry 
alongside their other duties. I should like to record here my 
gratitude and admiration for the way in which the Civil Service 
has met this task. I also draw attention to the meticulous way 
in which records were kept and preserved: without a clear audit 
trail, this Inquiry would have had no prospect of reaching the 
truth. 
  "The task of assisting the Inquiry has been made more 
fraught 
and onerous by grossly distorted and prejudicial allegations in 
the media about the role of government and individuals, 
including civil servants, in these matters. While I make no 
criticism or complaint about the Inquiry's procedures, the 
absence of the restraints on comment about the course of 
proceedings which would apply in a court of law has permitted 
wild allegations and prejudging of issues in media reports. 
  "I take just two examples about the subject matter of the 
Inquiry. One is the constant references, which have become 
common currency, to `arms sales to Iraq.' This has become known 
as the Arms to Iraq Inquiry. There were in fact no licences for 
the export of arms, that is lethal goods, issued by the British 
Government in this period. 
  "The second is the references to Public Interest Immunity 
certificates as `gagging orders.' As the Inquiry is well aware, 
the effect of such certificates is no more than to put in the 
hands of the Court the decision whether the information covered 
by the certificates should be disclosed to the defence. 
  "As regards comments on individuals I can use my own case as 
an example (though others have fared much worse). Even before I 
have given evidence to the Inquiry, there have been such 
scrapbook items as `The Butler did it,' `Cabinet chief linked to 
Iraqi gun cover-up' and `The trail of blood running through 
Whitehall in the wake of the arms to Iraq affair leads to the 
door of the Cabinet Secretary.' These are only examples of the 
general tone of coverage. 
  "While I hope and believe that people do not give this sort 
of report more weight than it deserves, such prejudicial press 
comment has been distressing for individuals concerned, and for 
their families, colleagues and close friends. The victims are 
often middle ranking officials who could not have expected to be 
thrust into the limelight in the way in which they have. I see, 
for example, that there is a snide piece in Private Eye this 
week about my former Private Secretary who was mentioned in 
evidence last week and who has not had an opportunity to give 
her evidence to the Inquiry. They have been asked not to respond 
to the press and to leave the issues to be judged by the 
Inquiry. I would like here to thank them and their families 
publicly and most sincerely for their cooperation and 
forbearance. 
  "I repeat that I neither make nor imply any criticisms of 
the 
procedures of this Inquiry but I register my concern and 
confidence, on behalf of the civil servants involved, that the 
Inquiry will in due course put the record straight and undo, so 
far as in its power, the damage which has been unfairly done to 
our system of government, to the reputation of the Civil Service 
and to individuals."

<F P=106> [Nicholas Wood report: "Trade Curbs Hamper Birth of </F>
Democracy Says Portillo"] 
  [Text] The European Community is hampering the birth of 
democracy in East Europe by restricting free trade, Michael 
Portillo, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday. 
  Only ten days after he was forced to withdraw blanket 
criticism of foreigners, Mr Portillo condemned the Community's 
reluctance to open up its markets to imports from East Europe 
and attacked its record on job creation. 
  "We have to recognise the intimate connection between 
political and economic freedom, and between economic freedom and 
free trade," Mr Portillo told the American Chamber of Commerce 
in London. "We have put restrictions on Polish suits, we have 
been very reluctant to admit Czech and Slovak steel, and we have 
been niggardly about sauerkraut and jam," he said. 
  Comparing the European Union unfavourably with the United 
States and Japan, he said that long holidays and short working 
weeks meant that in some European countries an employee cost as 
as much in "extras" as in wages. Although he was careful not to 
stray beyond the bounds of Government policy, Mr Portillo's 
Thatcherite critique of the EU served to highlight the tensions 
within the Tory Party as it prepares for the European elections 
in June. 
  These divisions were exposed yesterday by Michael 
Heseltine's 
scornful dismissal of Norman Lamont's call for a referendum if 
Britain ever wants to join a single European currency. The 
President of the Board of Trade, one of the Cabinet's foremost 
pro- Europeans, said: "Norman has his view.... But I don't 
think you will find that, in the pubs and clubs of Britain, the 
words of Norman Lamont are on everybody's lips." 
  Mr Heseltine said that a single currency was "not on the 
agenda." He suggested that in the eyes of many Tory MPs Mr 
Lamont's outspoken criticism of the European exchange-rate 
mechanism and a single currency were motivated by pique at being 
sacked as Chancellor. 
  Mr Heseltine's comments were privately echoed by loyalist 
ministers, who described the former Chancellor as a "sad man" 
without a following in the Commons or the country. But Mr 
Lamont received support from the Euro-sceptic wing of the party. 
Roger Knapman, MP for Stroud and a ringleader of the Maastricht 
rebels, said: "Norman was a Chancellor who absolutely understood 
financial and economic policies and as a consequence many 
colleagues will be listening carefully to what he has to say. 
When it comes to the choice between style and substance, most 
of us prefer the latter." 
  In his speech yesterday Mr Portillo said that Britain's 
continental partners were pricing themselves out of jobs. 
Praising President Clinton's support for free trade, he called 
for a joint Anglo-American effort to reverse the tide. "The 
world does not owe Europe a living. 
  "Europe as a whole tends to have the highest wage costs 
without high productivity, some of the longest holidays and some 
of the shortest working weeks in the world." 
  Over the past 20 years America had created jobs at the rate 
of 2 per cent a year and Japan had managed 1 per cent, Mr 
Portillo said. The EU had lagged behind at the rate of less than 
0.5 per cent a year, because of high unit wage costs.

<F P=106> [Emma Tucker report: "George Argues for Independence"] </F>
  [Text] Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, 
yesterday spelt out his vision for an independent central bank 
in a rare television interview. 
  Granting independence to the Bank would be the "most likely" 
way of achieving long-term, sustainable growth with low 
inflation, he said, but this could only happen when there was a 
consensus on the case for monetary stability. 
  "I think it would be helpful if there were that 
understanding," he said. "It would help us to achieve price 
stability which would enable the economy to grow in a more 
stable way and help reduce the risks of boom and bust." 
  Mr George, appearing on London Weekend Television's Walden 
programme, said it was appropriate to talk about a switch to 
independent accountability for the Bank, rather than pure 
independence. 
  "Our task would be specified within a statutory framework 
set 
out by the government," he said. He envisaged that parliament 
would define the objectives of monetary policy by setting an 
inflation target. 
  Mr George agreed politicians had become more attuned to the 
dangers of inflation but said they remained subject to 
short-term pressures which might make them take a risk which the 
Bank would not. 
  Mr George denied that the Bank would be "consistently 
tighter" on interest rates than under present arrangements. 
  He and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, saw "very much eye 
to eye" in the present circumstances. "But there would be 
circumstances where we would want to see interest rates higher 
than the government, because we would not be facing the same 
short-term political pressures." 
  The governor indicated that tomorrow's inflation report from 
the Bank would contain a much more positive assessment of the 
long-term prospects for inflation. 
  "The recorded level of inflation is increasing as it is 
bound 
to do because of the impact of indirect tax increases, but the 
underlying level of inflation is comfortably within the 
government's target for the time being," he said. "We don't 
expect it to rise over the far-out period but you will have to 
wait to see the detail." 
  Many City analysts believe the government will cut interest 
rates before the end of the year to soften the impact of tax 
increases. But there is a growing feeling that it will not want 
to take any risks with inflation and that the next move in 
interest rates will be up.

<F P=106> [Philip Bassett report: "CBI Hails Recovery But Warns on </F>
Tax Burden"] 
  [Text] Britain's economic recovery will not be halted by 
forthcoming tax increases, Howard Davies, Director General of 
the Confederation of British Industry [CBI], said last night. 
  The CBI added that the recovery in manufacturing industry 
had 
spread to all mainland regions of the UK. 
  The CBI's upbeat analysis of the economy was tempered by a 
warning from Mr Davies that the economy might not grow as 
rapidly as it had been as a result of the tax rises that are due 
to come into force in April. The CBI leader said that a study 
of past large tax rises did not suggest that a slowing down in 
consumer spending was inevitable, if the savings ratio fell. 
  Giving the biennial Bridge Lecture in the City, Mr Davies 
said the Government would be advised to reduce interest rates "a 
little further" this year, especially if the exchange rate 
strengthened or there was some adverse effect on confidence from 
the tax rises. 
  Mr Davies's remarks came after the CBI's latest regional 
breakdown of its authoritative industrial trends survey 
indicated that the recovery in manufacturers' orders has now 
spread to all mainland regions of the United Kingdom for the 
first time since the recession began. 
  Apart from Northern Ireland, the CBI's survey showed that 
total orders rose in all regions, with the largest increases in 
Yorkshire, the South East, Scotland and Wales. Business 
optimism is also up in all regions, while output has risen in 
eight areas of the UK. Overall demand and output are also 
expected to rise further in all mainland regions over the next 
four months. But the survey shows that manufacturing employment 
is still falling in all regions, except Scotland, although the 
rate of job losses has eased. 
  Job losses are forecast to be acute in the South East, where 
the CBI estimates that 16,000 more jobs will be lost alone in 
manufacturing industry in the first quarter of this year. 
However, despite the still gloomy job prospects, the survey's 
findings prompted optimistic views of the economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Gordon Brown, opposition chief secretary to the </F>
Treasury: "The 64,000 Pound Tax Question for the Tories"] 
  [Text] The Tories have lost all claim to be the party of 
low taxation. As the bills for economic failure have mounted -- 
the inevitable consequence of high unemployment, slow growth and 
increased poverty -- so taxes have risen to pay them. Reversing 
these economic failures will be the priority for a Labour 
government. 
  No one should be fooled into thinking that tax policy will 
cease to be an issue at the next election; only next time the 
options for the electorate will be very different from the bogus 
choice posed by the Tories in 1992. Voters will not decide on 
Tory claims on low taxation -- the Tories can never again 
pretend with any credibility to be a low tax party -- but 
between fair tax under Labour and unfair tax under the Tories. 
  Most families are paying more of their income in taxes today 
-- more indirect tax and more income tax -- than they did in 
l979 under Labour. Taxes are set to rise continually over the 
next five years to levels higher than under any Labour 
government. But taxes are not being raised fairly. Far from 
it. It is time to ask who has done best out of Tory tax 
policies since 1979, and who has suffered most. The British 
people deserve to know who will suffer most from the tax 
increases already announced, and from proposed VAT [value-added 
tax] extensions in the future. 
  The truth behind the Tory tax deceptions, as I have revealed 
this week, is that our taxation regime is more unfair than at 
any other time since the 1930s. It is more unfair than that of 
any other major competing European economy and becoming more 
unfair with every day that passes. 
  It is not just the imposition of VAT on fuel which is 
hitting 
poorer families harder. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has 
shown, in a detailed look at the impact of all the implemented 
and planned tax changes on lower and middle income groups, that 
poorer households will be paying more in taxes by the time of 
the next election than they were in 1985, while better off 
households will be paying less. The poorest 10 per cent will 
still be 3 pounds a week worse off. The top 10 per cent will be 
31.30 pounds a week better off. 
  When the analysis is extended all the way back to 1979, the 
truth becomes even starker. The British tax system, in theory 
redistributive, has become -- in the hands of the Tories -- a 
powerful weapon in a very different struggle: to reinforce 
inequality, to further enrich very rich people who do not need 
this help. 
  The 64,000 pound question the Tories must now answer is 
this: 
why is it that only those earning 64,000 pounds or more are 
paying less in tax than they did in 1979? 
  The answer is that the rest of us are paying more -- and 
nowhere is the new unfairness better demonstrated than at the 
top of the scale. The top one per cent of earners have done 
extraordinarily well under the Tories. Thirty per cent of all 
tax reductions since 1979 -- worth around 75 billion [U.S. 
trillion] pounds in today's money -- went to them. But, with 
taxes rising again under the Lamont-Clarke budgets, the share of 
the top one per cent in the total tax pain amounts to only four 
per cent of the extra revenue raised. In other words, the 
unfairness of the 1980s tax bonanza for the one per cent is 
simply compounded by the 1990s retrenchment. 
  They received a total of 75 billion pounds over 14 years 
and now they are being asked to give only 600 million pounds of 
it back. The rest of us are paying more tax than we did. But 
the highest income earners, even after the budgets of 1992, will 
still retain 99 per cent of the tax handouts they have gained 
since 1979. 
  But who are the people benefiting from the extra tax that 
ordinary people will pay? The top one per cent earn an average 
of 120,000 pounds. Their average reduction in income tax from 
1979 was 35,000 pounds. Now income tax increases will take back 
1,000 pounds a year. Other tax increases including VAT will 
take another 1,000 pounds. The very rich are left on an average 
33,000 pounds better off. The rest of us do far less well. 
  There is no justification for this largesse to the already 
rich when so many are in poverty. The Brown report into tax 
incentives in the late 1980s found no case for such cuts on the 
grounds that they encouraged the one per cent or so to work 
harder. Further incentives were not needed. 
  The evidence is that top rate payers were as likely to spend 
more time with their golf clubs as they were to work longer 
hours in response to retaining a larger fraction of their 
income. They still use tax havens abroad as a means of tax 
avoidance. Charities did not benefit, and spare cash went on 
imported luxuries rather than into investment in the economy. 
  Claims made about the economic benefits of tax breaks for 
the 
one per cent simply do not stand up. With millions of people in 
poverty and unemployment, the resources could have been put to 
better and fairer use. 
  A new approach to tax is now needed. Labour has pledged to 
build a new trust on tax between people and government. Labour 
will not promise one thing on tax and deliver the opposite as 
the Tories have done. 
  I myself promise open disclosure, full consultation and 
proper accountability in fiscal policy-making which seeks to 
link what people pay in tax to the services they receive. In 
this context we are prepared to consider hypothecated taxation. 
  Second, there needs to be -- and under Labour will be -- a 
fairer distribution of the tax burden. And that means not only 
rejecting the Tory VAT obsession that has bred unfairness, but 
judging every measure not just by the economic dynamism it can 
foster but by the fairness it can achieve. 
  No Labour government would have tolerated the way in which 
the Tories have punished ordinary people by raising their taxes 
in order to fund massive tax cuts for very high earners who do 
not need the benefits. Nor will we in the future.
