<F P=106> [Report on interview with UK Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd </F>
by Andrew Marr and Donald MacIntyre; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Think of the Old Tories and, chances are, you think 
of Douglas Hurd. In a government which seems increasingly 
febrile and undignified, he remains a relict of patrician calm 
-- unflappable, poised, his standing in the party apparently 
undiminished by foreign policy controversies. The same 
qualities that so handicapped him in the leadership contest 
against John Major more than three years ago seem now rather 
valuable and rare. However confused they are about other 
ministers, the grassroots Tories still trust Douglas. Now he is 
in charge of writing the party's European manifesto, doing the 
thinking for the campaign widely seen as Mr Major's last chance. 
  This is not the way he would like to see his task. Speaking 
publicly for the first time about his strategy for that 
election, he argues that the party itself would not stand for 
another parliamentary coup: "I think it would be so silly that 
it won't happen. The shock of what happened in 1990 is still 
quite strong among active Conservatives, and I think the idea of 
that happening again would horrify them, so it would be crazy." 
It would be electorally self-destructive? "Yes." 
  Logically, that might be so. Politically, it is hard to deny 
that a fresh outburst of factional fighting over Europe, 
followed by terrible losses, could send the Conservative Party 
into such a jellied state that Mr Major would be putsched. Mr 
Hurd is well aware that the job of constructing a unifying 
European policy is not only intellectually difficult but, in 
terms of politics, essential. So how is he going about it? 
  The theory may sound optimistic, too convenient to be true. 
It is essentially that the dragon of federalist centralism has 
died of old age. St George is not needed: "The founding 
fathers of the Community looked at a Europe which had been twice 
shattered in this century and they said we really mustn't let 
loose the nation states to do this again." But now, argues 
Hurd, the danger of a war between Britain, France and Germany 
has gone, and with it the need for the centralising model 
devised to prevent it. 
  That being so, the centralisers are all caught on the wrong 
side of history. Germany, France, even President Delors, now see 
the need to retain the nation state and to limit the power of 
Brussels, leaving Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the more 
extreme Tory federalists out of date. Maastricht was a 
compromise, Hurd says. And yet the countries of Europe only just 
got it through by a handful of votes, in Denmark, in France, in 
the British Parliament. "I think the view which is simply 
centralising is an old-fashioned one. There are plenty of 
people who hold it still but I think it's old-fashioned, and 
gradually it's losing ground. It's no less European to argue 
for the kind of Europe that I'm talking about than it to argue 
for what I call the old-fashioned view, that gradually, bit by 
bit, decision making moves to the centre...." 
  This will be hailed by all but the hard-line Europhobes as a 
distinct tilt to their position, a coded acknowledgement that 
they were right. It offers rather less to Mr Hurd's old allies 
on the "Positive European" wing of the party. There will be a 
ban on xenophobic rhetoric in the campaign, no echoes of the 
disastrous "Diet of Brussels" sloganising of the 1989 campaign. 
But anti-centralism is still anti-centralism, however modulated 
and civilised the tone in which it is expressed. 
  The tactics, though, are as interesting as the theory. Mr 
Hurd has identified the Conservative Party's relationship with 
the European People's Party -- the grouping of mainly federalist 
centre-right parties in the Union -- as a potential weak spot in 
the campaign. So the Tories will distinguish between their 
loose "alliance" with sister parties, and Labour's subordinate 
role as a wing of the European socialist grouping. Labour will 
be at tacked for the views of continental socialists while the 
Conservatives will deny any responsibility for the views of 
their allies. 
  There is, of course, a contradiction here: if the Europeans 
are moving against centralism, why be so careful to distinguish 
the British Tories from their sister parties? But this is 
perhaps one of those nuances which will be lost in the 
campaigning. 
  It would be a considerable achievement to limit the Tory 
split on Europe. But Mr Hurd acknowledges that the campaign 
will be fought on the Government's general reputation too, and 
that ill-disciplined factionalism among Tory politicians could 
blow apart the carefully constructed platform. He distinguishes 
between real differences over policy and principle, when 
"serious politicians are entitled to make their view known", and 
the current factionalism, which he regards as more trivial, 
though dangerous: "a tendency, I don't say to start the 
telephone conversation, but when asked for views to chatter away 
without a great deal of thought, sometimes attributably, 
sometimes, unattributably, without considering whether the 
impression given really corresponds to reality. And I think 
that phase...has to be brought to an end. It has done the 
Labour Party a lot of harm in the past, and it will do us a lot 
of harm if it continues." 
  Leaders can only do so much: they rely on the discipline of 
the party always. But is this a Government that deserves to 
survive? When asked whether he can imagine entering the next 
election with a government record of which he can feel proud, Mr 
Hurd gamely says that this is what he expects to happen. He 
lists the conventional hopes of economic recovery, progress on 
education and law and order, a consensus on Europe. So far as 
"the basics, as they're now called" are concerned, he is clearly 
not hung up on the words and suggests less morally charged 
alternatives such as "common sense" or "the fundamentals." 
  But what of the so-called sleaze factor, the idea that 
standards of public morality are not all they should be? Is 
this something that is simply of interest to the chattering 
classes which will fade away with economic recovery? Mr Hurd 
thinks not, and takes a fairly robust view on the need for 
ministers and MPs to be closely scrutinised. Scandals were 
"dealt with...through a mixture of public criticism and 
misfortune" which could be "harsh." 
  Unlike Lord Howe, one of his predecessors in the Foreign 
Office, he was relaxed about the Scott inquiry into the Matrix 
Churchill affair. He was, he says, "reassured" by his 
appearance at the inquiry at the "tone and content" of the 
issues the inquiry was concentrating on. It is too early to 
say, but those issues seem "light years" from the "penumbra" 
created by many of the press stories about the inquiry. 
  And on the Pergau dam affair, if it is being said that it's 
wrong to sell defence equipment to Malaysia, and it's wrong that 
in all circumstances Britain's aid effort should help our 
exporters round the country, then he says he is rather looking 
forward to appearing before the Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee. But anyway, he insists, no one in his department 
brushes these issues aside as trivial. Every Question Time, 
every appearance at the Public Accounts Committee or Scott, he 
says, are "huge events" and have to be treated accordingly. 
  What is finally striking about Douglas Hurd is his 
resilience, his dogged optimism where optimism seems 
unreasonable. It may be partly a facade, but it's also about 
that mysterious Tory quality, "bottom." This is how 
Conservatives used to be.

<F P=106> [Speech by David Hunt, UK secretary of state for employment, </F>
to the Institute for Directors in London on 15 February: "The 
Challenge of Competitiveness"] 
  [Text] I am very pleased to be here today, and to have the 
chance to offer you a few thoughts on the challenge facing the 
British economy and you as employers. 
  There is every indication that our economy is now poised to 
make positive strides towards a more competitive and successful 
era. But we must not sit back; it is vital to build a 
competitive economy not only for the 1990's but for the 21st 
century. 
  As you all know we face tough competition in overseas 
markets 
- not just from our European neighbours, but from the Far East 
and the rapidly developing economies of the Pacific Rim. 
  I want to highlight for you a number of initiatives which 
will help to build our economy where it counts, at the most 
local level. Integration of Government programmes at Regional 
and local level 
  First our decision to combine the existing Regional Offices 
of the Departments of the Environment, Employment, Trade and 
Industry, and Transport. 
  In the past there has been criticism of the inefficient way 
in which Government programmes and services can operate. They 
have been described as `a patchwork quilt of complexity and 
idiosyncracy'. 
  I and my Government colleagues take these concerns 
seriously. 
Four years ago we announced the introduction of Training and 
Enterprise Councils [TEC] - the TECS organisations designed to 
make Government training and enterprise programmes more 
responsive and relevant to local business needs. Now we have 
gone much further with the announcement in November of 
Integrated Regional offices and the Single Regeneration Budget. 
  This is an exciting opportunity to bring together programmes 
from different Government Departments into a more dynamic and 
cohesive package, at regional level. 
  So from April this year a whole range of Government 
decisions 
about transport, housing, environmental improvement, support for 
business, training and skills will be taken in the Integrated 
Regional Offices. 
<H5>  The Importance of Local Partnership </H5>
  But Government is, of course, not the only player in all 
this. Government can set a national framework for others to work 
within, but we look to others locally to identify needs and 
decide how to meet them. 
  Just as Government has recognised the importance of bringing 
together its regional structures into a working partnership, so 
must other local players, including business, do the same. 
Partnership at local level will be critical to our future 
economic success. In particular this will be true when the 
Senior Directors of the new integrated offices are deciding 
priorities for the Single Regeneration Budget which will bring 
together twenty previously separate programmes worth 1.4 billion 
pounds. Government is convinced that if we are to make the most 
of this money it has to be spent on projects generated jointly 
among the local community. 
  TECs will be key private sector partners for the 
Government's 
integrated regional offices, taking the lead alongside local 
authorities in formulating plans for local economic development 
and building the partnerships to achieve them. They must 
mobilise the wide range of local players who contribute to local 
regeneration and economic development. Where partnerships do not 
already exist, they can take steps to pull people together, to 
create a local vision and purpose. 
<H3>  The Contribution of Training and Skills To a Competitive 
Economy </H3>
  My second theme is about my Department's central 
contribution 
to making the UK economy more competitive. Without the right 
skills our economic competitiveness will suffer; with them, we 
can all enjoy greater and longer lasting prosperity. 
  Britain has moved a long way in last decade. Ten years ago 
it 
was said that UK employers were just not interested in training. 
It wasn't true then and it's not true today. Today around 1,200 
top business and community leaders are involved in running 
Training and Enterprise Councils. 770 companies have their most 
senior Directors on TEC Boards. 
  Many business people do now recognise training as a key 
investment in their competitive strategy. Over 570 organisations 
have now achieved Investors in People status, requiring them to 
demonstrate that they have taken full account of the development 
needs of every employee; and some 4,600 more are committed to 
achieving it. Firms enjoy business benefits such as improved 
business performance; enhanced financial results; and greater 
job satisfaction for their people. That job satisfaction comes 
from a better appreciation among individuals of the value of 
effective training and development. 
  Each year the National Training Awards competition 
identifies 
winners who are living proof that training pays - that it 
increases competitiveness. You can't win unless you can show a 
direct link between the training you did and the impact on your 
business or your career. 
  It is not uncommon to find savings or increased profits 
measured in the millions, or businesses completely turned round 
and saved from bankruptcy because they did the right training at 
the right time in the right way. 
  I am very pleased to launch the 1994 National Training 
Awards 
[NTA] competition here today. I hope that the Institute of 
Directors will continue its support for the competition. Every 
part of the country has its NTA champions and they are ready to 
share with others how they achieved their success. Nothing is 
more effective in persuading others that a real life story: it 
says far more than Ministerial exhortations ever can. 
<H5>  Prosperity Through Skills </H5>
  Recently I set out my vision for vocational education and 
training in a document called Prosperity through skills. This 
sets out a strategy for everybody who has an interest in 
increasing individual and national prosperity -- that means 
employers and individuals as well as training organisations. I 
hope you will all take the time to read it. 
  I offer four priorities for action: 

  -  Employers, the self 
employed and individuals in the workforce must invest 
effectively in the skills needed for business and individual 
success. 
  -  People who are out of work or disadvantaged in the 
labour market must be able to acquire and maintain skills 
allowing them to compete better for work and contribute more 
effectively to the economy. 
  -  Young people must be motivated to 
gain the skills and qualifications needed for today's -- and 
tomorrow's jobs. 
  -  We must ensure that education and training meet 
the needs of business and individuals. 
  For the economy to flourish every sector, every industry, 
and 
every business in the country must perform at its best. 
Effective investment in people is an essential ingredient of 
business success, helping to maximise the benefit of all other 
forms of investment. 
<H5>  Modern Apprenticeships </H5>
  Finally, it gave me a lot of pleasure to announce recently 
my 
plans for Modern Apprenticeships which will produce a new route 
to recognised qualifications at `A' level equivalent, and jobs, 
for about 40,000 young people each year, compared with around 
12,000 at present. 
  Modern apprenticeships represent a step change in the 
government's approach to training. This is a supply-side 
revolution, led by industry, to give the country the skills it 
needs and improve our economic competitiveness. They will be for 
young people who leave school at 16 or 17 and want to train to 
higher level vocational skills. They will offer high quality 
training to technician and supervisor levels - NVQ Level 3 (or 
`A' level equivalent). 
  Modern apprenticeships will instigate a real skills 
revolution by combining modern qualifications and learning 
methods with the best of our apprenticeship traditions. I want 
to see them in all sectors from information technology to 
engineering. I want employers in each sector to decide detailed 
arrangements. And I want to see employers and apprentices 
signing a pledge to agree the training to be provided and 
entering a mutual commitment to see it through. 
  We shall run modern apprenticeships using the successful 
arrangements for Youth Credits. The Government recognises that 
high quality training is not cheap, and is quite willing to play 
and -- pay -- its part. We will invest 1.25 billion pounds in 
Youth Credits and modern apprenticeships over the next three 
years. 
  But modern apprenticeships can only succeed if employers 
working with TECs and others respond and provide the necessary 
places. If they do we envisage there could be about 150,000 
young apprentices training in England at any one time. We expect 
to run pilots in 1994, and TECs and Industry Training 
organisations will have a pivotal role in preparing a full range 
of modern apprenticeships for young people to start in 1995. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  I have spoken about the importance of partnerships and the 
contribution of training to our economic success. The goal we 
seek is of immense value - it is no less than the future 
well-being of our nation. I ask you to support us in our efforts 
to meet that goal. Without you we cannot but fail.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [17 February], the Federal 
Government expressed regret about the "unilateral" Greek trade 
blockade against Macedonia. The blockade of the access to the 
sea is "noted with concern," Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin 
Erdmann stated on inquiry. Thus, the Federal Government has 
taken up a position against a European Union [EU] partner who is 
also holding the EU Presidency in the first half of 1994. The 
Federal Government wants "more and not less stability" in the 
region. 
  FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will broach the new 
development within the framework of the EU troika, which had 
previously announced it would meet in Athens this Friday. The 
troika consists of Kinkel and the foreign ministers of Greece 
and Belgium. The three acting EU foreign ministers wanted to 
discuss the Russian attitude toward the Bosnian crisis and the 
NATO ultimatum. Greece's announcement that it will block 
Macedonia's only access to the sea has obviously surprised the 
ministers. 
  Now the extraordinary case might come to pass that Greece 
must expect a contrary decision by the Brussels Commission. The 
Bonn Foreign Ministry pointed out that an EU member "simply 
cannot" block "the trade routes of other EU members" who want to 
conduct trade with the Republic of Macedonia through Salonika.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The series of German-Finnish 
consultations on Helsinki's entry into the European Union (EU) 
has continued, with the foreign ministers meeting in Bonn on 
Wednesday [16 Februaqry]. The exchange of opinions between FRG 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his counterpart, Heikki 
Haavisto, focused on Finland's concerns about structural 
adjustments and the special agricultural problems of the Nordic 
winter economy. For Finnish politicians, the negotiations for 
membership have entered the "decisive stage." They are banking 
on German support in Brussels. In January, Foreign Trade 
Minister Perti Salolainen was in Bonn and Parliamentary 
President Ilkka Suominen followed a few days later.

  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main/Bonn (DPA) -- After warnings from 
Bonn because of the conflict between China and Tibet, the Dalai 
Lama, the Tibetan leader, has declined an invitation to the 
1,200th anniversary of Frankfurt/Main. The Foreign Ministry had 
warned the city that the simultaneous invitation of the Dalai 
Lama and the mayor of Frankfurt's Chinese partner city of 
Guangzhou could lead to "problems." On Wednesday [16 February] 
the Dalai Lama's Swiss representative office declined the 
invitation that Frankfurt Mayor Andreas von Schoeler (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany) had extended to the Dalai Lama, who 
lives in exile in India. 
  The 58-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is calling for the 
reestablishment of the autonomous status of Tibet, which is 
under Chinese sovereignty. The statement of the Tibetan office 
in Zurich says the Dalai Lama had been very sorry to hear that 
his acceptance of the invitation had led to problems that had 
been created without his fault "as a result of obviously 
political motives." He wants to spare the city and its 
population difficulties. He had been pleased with the 
invitation, it was stated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Germany and the Slovak Republic have agreed to 
large-scale military cooperation. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
and his Slovak counterpart, Imrich Andrejcak, signed an 
agreement to that effect in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, on 
Tuesday afternoon [8 February]. 
  After signing the agreement, Ruehe, who is spending a 
two-day 
visit in Slovakia, said that 20 Slovak officers are expected to 
attend a short course at the Koblenz Center for Internal 
Leadership at the end of February. He said he is pleased that 
Slovakia wants to contribute to Europe under the NATO 
Partnership for Peace program. This will bring about stability 
both for Slovakia and Europe. 
  President Michal Kovac and Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
assured Ruehe that their country is "very interested in becoming 
a member of NATO." This coming Wednesday, Slovakia will sign 
the Partnership for Peace Agreement in Brussels. Andrejcak said 
that Bundeswehr officers will help his country's Army to 
establish a rapid strike force. 
  The German-Slovak cooperation will include a regular 
exchange 
of information on all issues of security policy and on the use 
of armed forces in disaster relief missions and humanitarian aid 
missions. The contacts between individual parts of the two 
forces are to be deepened, and officers shall be given the 
opportunity to take part in military training courses in the 
host country. 
  The Bundeswehr and the Slovak Army are also planning to 
cooperate in matters of planning, arms control, and internal 
leadership, as well as military medicine. They also intend to 
cooperate in the fields of sports, military bands, and 
reservists. On Wednesday, Ruehe will watch an exercise of 
armored units of the Slovak Army.

  [Text] Bonn, Feb 7 (CTK) -- Czech Trade and Industry 
Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said today that the eventual failure of 
Czech-Bavarian talks on the Ingolstadt oil pipeline would affect 
the Czech public's opinion of the German Government as well. 
  "If the talks failed, the German public would have to 
understand that the Czechs would no longer take into 
consideration whether the Bavarian or the German Government had 
direct powers over the oil pipeline issue," Dlouhy said. 
  Meeting with Bernd Schmidbauer from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
office who is responsible for the coordination of intelligence 
services' activities and for European affairs, Dlouhy said: "If 
the talks failed and the construction of the oil pipeline did 
not start, the Czech party will consider it as a certain lower 
measure of preparedness of the German party to offer support in 
a matter of such strategic and security importance as the 
construction of an alternative oil pipeline." 
  Construction of the pipeline from the Bavarian town of 
Ingolstadt to Kralupy, central Bohemia, began in the Czech 
Republic in September. Construction of the pipeline in Germany 
was expected to begin this spring. The entire project should be 
completed in 1995, unless it is further derailed in Bavarian 
Parliament. The oil pipeline is to end the Czech Republic's 
dependence on deliveries from Russia, the sole oil supplier to 
date. 
  On a one-day visit to Germany, Dlouhy said it was not yet 
necessary to seek the Bonn government's assistance in the 
Czech-Bavarian talks on financial guarantees for uninsurable 
unpredictable damage. The talks are continuing, Dlouhy said, 
expressing the hope that a compromising solution would soon be 
found by Prague and Munich. 
  Last week, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the 
Bavarian Government was not a partner for the Czech Government 
to reach agreement on any guarantees. 
  Dlouhy also informed Schmidbauer about a law banning arms

  He dismissed rumors about possible exports of components for 
nuclear facilities to Iran through the Skoda heavy engineering 
works based in Plzen, west Bohemia. He said that "anything like 
this is a nonsense at the moment."

  [Text] Bonn -- Germany wants to continue its cooperation 
with Brazil and Argentina in the field of nuclear energy, 
following Brazil's ratification of a relevant nuclear safeguard 
accord. The "quadripartite agreement" allows the Vienna-based 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEO) to inspect nuclear 
installations of partners to the agreement. The Brazilian 
Senate ratified the agreement last Wednesday [9 February], 
apparently under pressure from the Federal Government. 
  On Friday, the Foreign Ministry in Bonn said this "will 
create a stronger nonproliferation basis to allow continued 
cooperation in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy." 
The Federal Government hopes Brazil will shortly ratify the 
Tlatelolco Agreement on creating a nuclear weapons-free zone in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, the ministry said. The German 
company Siemens-KWU is building the Angra II nuclear power plant 
near Rio de Janeiro. 
  According to reports in the Brazilian press, the Federal 
Government threatened to stop nuclear cooperation after 1995 
unless Brazil admits IAEO inspectors. At the moment, routine 
inspections can only be carried out on appointment and in 
certain installations. If there is a founded suspicion of 
radioactive material being used for military applications, the 
IAEO may also examine the sensitive area of uranium enrichment. 
Brazil had repeatedly been suspected of being far advanced into 
building a nuclear bomb.

  [Text] Bonn -- The interior ministers of the federal and 
laender governments agreed to extend Croatian civil war 
refugees' right to stay in Germany. After a five-hour meeting, 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said that due to the difficult 
economic situation in Croatia, and in order to give the state an 
appropriate period of time to look after those returning, the 
repatriation to "pacified regions" in Croatia would be extended. 
  This means that refugees from areas occupied and destroyed 
by 
the Serbs can stay in Germany up to 30 June 1995. The 
repatriation of childless married couples, or single, childless 
adults, will begin on 1 May, and will be finished by 31 October. 
  The interior ministers pointed out, however, that the 
refugees' stay in Germany could only be a temporary one. The 
Federal Government should be asked to discuss the best possible 
solution to the repatriation problem with the Croat Government 
as soon as possible.

  [Text] In spite of the strict austerity measures, public 
debts will soar to gigantic heights this year. According to 
Bundesbank estimates, federal, laender and municipal debts, 
including those of the Federal Railways and the Trust Agency, 
could "reach almost 2 trillion." In its latest monthly report, 
the Bundesbank says that at the end of 1993, debts increased to 
1.74 trillion German marks [DM] -- that is, 56 percent of the 
GNP. 
  With a predicted debt volume of almost DM2 trillion at the 
end of this year, public indebtedness would "jump" close to the 
"critical limit" laid down in the Maastricht Treaty's 
convergence criteria, which says that public indebtedness may 
only be a maximum 60 percent of economic achievement. 
  The total public expenditure in 1993 was some DM140 billion 
higher than revenues, which increased the deficit by DM30 
billion over 1992. New indebtedness was almost DM160 billion 
due to cash reserves being formed from "stockpiling credits." 
For 1994, the Bundesbank expects the shortfall in public funds 
"to stabilize at the 1993 level." 
  According to the Bundesbank, a further increase in the 
government budget deficit will be prevented by the increase in 
fuel tax and pension contributions, as well as by strong efforts 
to cut expenditures. Although consolidating public funds during 
a recession is particularly difficult, there is no alternative 
to this approach. The way out via a further increase in taxes 
and social insurance contributions is "practically blocked": 
Germany is among the countries "with the highest rates in taxes 
and contributions," the report says.

  [Text] By demanding "varied wages," the Bundesbank has made 
a clear statement against the background of the current wage 
disputes. "In order to do justice to the different conditions in 
the individual sectors and regions, wages must be varied. 
Regions with weak infrastructures in both eastern and western 
Germany require a lower wage level than strong regions, not 
least because job opportunities must be improved," the 
Bundesbank's latest monthly report states. 
  One of the reasons it considers such a variation in wages 
justifiable is "that the cost of living in the individual 
regions varies." Thus, housing costs -- be it for one's own or 
rented accommodation -- are "much lower in areas with a weak 
infrastructure than in prospering urban areas." Wages in 
eastern Germany are reported to have been 80 percent of the west 
German average at the end of 1993. "This means that the 
catching-up process should slowly be coming to an end." 
  The Bundesbank is still very cautious about evaluating 
economic trends. "The basic trend of the west German economy 
continues to be in a trough; recession has not been completely 
overcome." The Bundesbank considers "mainly domestic factors 
responsible" for the continuing sluggishness. Thus, in private 
households, "higher incomes are more than used up by price 
increases and increases in taxes and contributions." There is, 
therefore, "no financial room" to fulfill any additional wishes 
consumers might have. 
  The Bundesbank considers investment behavior still impaired 
by "declining business profits, a lack of positive future 
outlook, as well as a continuing low capacity utilization." 
Capacity utilization is so low at the moment that 
rationalization projects rather than investments seem to be the 
priority." In "the otherwise rather gloomy economic landscape," 
the guardians of the currency see rays of hope in the fields of 
housing construction and foreign demand. 
  Even if the expected upswing were to take place, they do not 
expect the labor market to relax yet. "Companies' adjustment to 
the lower level of activity has not yet been completed." In 
December, 610,000 fewer people were in gainful employment in 
western Germany than the previous year; at a seasonally adjusted 
2.5 million, the number of unemployed was some 480,000 above the 
1992 figure. A positive development is the slowing-down of 
price increases, the Bundesbank says: Taking out the mineral 
oil tax increase, "seasonally adjusted consumer prices only went 
up at an annual 2.5 percent over the last six months." 
  The monthly report notes a "continuing vigorous economic 
growth," in eastern Germany, which has also reached the 
processing industry. Although new products and improved 
production methods have made east German businesses more 
competitive in Germany, they have not yet been able to gain a 
sufficient foothold in foreign markets." The Bundesbank 
considers the level of economic activity in the new laender 
"still low." Yet, job cuts are coming to an end, it says.

  [Excerpt] Berlin (DPA) -- The Bundeswehr continues to 
wonder what happened to about 81,000 tonnes of Russian 
ammunition in eastern Germany. This was confirmed by the German 
liaison command with the Western Group of Russian Forces in 
Berlin on Wednesday [16 February]. In view of the high risk, 
the Bundeswehr demands immediate clarification. It was stated 
that the missing ammunition cannot be found on any list. 
  According to an official statement by Matvey Burlakov, the 
commander in chief of the Russian forces in eastern Germany, the 
ammunition was used up at training sites, said Bundeswehr 
Lieutenant Commander Klaus Heermeier. However, he thinks that 
this is completely unlikely. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Erfurt (DPA) -- With a real economic growth of 11.6 
percent in 1993, Thuringia was right at the head of the new 
laender. The GDP's development was "quite remarkable" compared 
with the average of the new laender, which was 6.3 percent, and 
confirms the economic course that is being followed, Economic 
State Secretary Friedrich Stamm said in Erfurt on Thursday [17 
February]. According to first estimates by the Economic Overall 
Calculation for the Laender Working Group, Saxony came in second 
in 1993 with a real growth of 6.6 percent. 
  East Berlin experienced a growth of 1.8 percent compared 
with 
the previous year, Brandenburg 5.2 percent, Mecklenburg-Western 
Pomerania 5.9 percent, and Saxony-Anhalt 5.6 percent. In 1993, 
however, Thuringia was clearly below the average regarding the 
per capita GDP in the new laender, which, according to Stamm, 
was 13,500 marks. Thuringia reached only 12,500 marks. Stamm 
justified this primarily with the large number of approximately 
70,000 commuters, whose performance is not included in the 
calculations.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU], and the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] 
have slightly caught up in popularity with the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] and Rudolf Scharping, its candidate for 
the chancellor's office. This is shown by the RTL "Chancellor's 
Barometer," which was presented on Thursday [17 February]. 
According to this poll, Kohl's popularity rose by 1 percent to 
26 percent compared with the previous week. The head of 
government, however, is still 9 percent behind Scharping (35 
percent), who lost 2 percent. 
  According to the poll, 31 percent of the voters would vote 
for the CDU/CSU, which is 1 percent more than last week. The 
SPD, on the other hand, would lose 2 percent, but would still 
have the support of 44 percent of the voters. With 6 percent of 
the votes, the Free Democratic Party of Germany would exceed 5 
percent for the first time in weeks. The figures of Alliance 
90/Greens (10 percent), as well as the Party of Democratic 
Socialism and the Republikaner (3 percent each), have remained 
unchanged. 
  For this poll, the Forsa Institute questioned 2,514 German 
citizens on behalf of the RTL morning program "Good Morning, 
Germany."

  [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
(Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) has again sharply attacked 
Johannes Rau, the Social Democratic Party of Germany's 
presidential candidate. At a CDU election event in Hannover on 
Wednesday evening [16 February], Kohl said Rau had "not felt 
solidarity with the Germans of the GDR" in the second half of 
the 1980's. If the Social Democrats now say that the discussion 
of their behavior toward the former GDR leadership is 
"mudslinging," they only want to divert the people's attention, 
the CDU chairman told 2,500 participants in the event. 
  He sticks to his accusation that at that time leading Social 
Democrats had given in to central demands of ex-GDR head of 
state Erich Honecker. They had advocated dissolving the 
Salzgitter documentation center for human rights violations in 
the GDR and abandoning joint German citizenship. "We never 
betrayed the ideal of German unity, despite all the mistakes we 
made," Kohl cried to the CDU membership. 
  In the event of wage conflicts in the metal industry, Kohl 
warned against strikes and lockouts. He called on both sides of 
industry to solve the wage conflicts at the negotiating table. 
"I do not believe that strikes and lockouts would be helpful 
for jobs and the unemployed in this situation," Kohl said. On 
the contrary, an industrial conflict would "seriously damage" 
the competitiveness of the German economy. Therefore, the 
employers and the trade unions should get together. Kohl again 
presented the latest conclusion of a collective agreement in the 
chemical industry as an "act of reason," both regarding the wage 
agreement of 2 percent and more flexible working hours.

  [Text] Bayerbach/Vilshofen (DPA) -- Free Democratic Party 
[FDP] Chairman Klaus Kinkel came out against strikes and 
lockouts in the current difficult economic situation. At his 
party's traditional Ash Wednesday meeting in Bayerbach, Lower 
Bavaria, Kinkel called for a "radical change of thinking" in 
labor market policy. Strikes and lock-outs are "a fist in the 
eye of the economic development"; in view of the high number of 
unemployed, all politicians must work to ensure the recovery of 
the economy. 
  FRG Foreign Minister Kinkel called for a zero round in the 
public sector and a stop to the "galloping state debts," and he 
rejected tax increases for higher earners. The FDP politician 
said that "the old-style social state" is "unsocial, cannot be 
financed, and is counterproductive." It must be placed on a 
narrower but solid basis. The social state must not become a 
"milking cow," Kinkel stressed.

  [Text] Vilshofen (DPA) -- At the political Ash Wednesday 
event of the Bavarian Social Democrats, the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] began the election campaign with attacks 
against the Federal Government and the Christian Social Union 
[CSU]. 
  The mood in the SPD is good at the moment, "but this must 
now 
be turned into votes," SPD candidate for the chancellor's office 
Rudolf Scharping said, speaking to an audience of more than 
1,000 people at the traditional SPD meeting in Vilshofen, Lower 
Bavaria. In the overcrowded meeting hall, Bavarian SPD 
Chairwoman Renate Schmidt called for bringing about a change in 
the government: "It is time for a change." 
  Scharping accused the Federal Government of damaging 
Germany's "greatest asset," the stability of social peace, the 
quality of work, and internal security. A change must finally 
be brought about in Bonn: Even though the SPD has already won 
in many polls, it must now also win the elections: "Helmut Kohl 
as a retiree in Oggersheim -- this is a nice prospect for Kohl 
and a useful one for Germany," Scharping said. 
  In his view, the CSU "deserves a rest after its many 
affairs." It is so busy with mastering its affairs that it is no 
longer contributing toward mastering the problems in Germany. 
Bavaria also deserves a "good female minister president." 
  Renate Schmidt criticized the Bavarian government party by 
saying that the "Republikanization of the CSU" is increasing. 
Anyone who makes a policy with the "fear of having too many 
foreigners" must not be surprised that right-wing extremists are 
on the rise.

  [Text] Osterhofen (DPA) -- Franz Schoenhuber, chairman of 
the right-wing extremist Republikaner, has predicted that the 
Christian Social Union [CSU] will decline to a 20-percent party. 
"This is the day of change and the greatest day in the history 
of the Republikaner," Schoenhuber stated at his party's Ash 
Wednesday rally in front of an audience of -- according to 
police estimates -- about 6,500 people in a beer tent on the 
outskirts of Osterhofen, Lower Bavaria. The end of the 
traditional parties is near. "I have been chosen by fate to 
help the German people," Schoenhuber said. On Wednesday the 
hour of the CSU's decline tolled in Passau [where the CSU is 
holding its Ash Wednesday rally]. The rise of the Republikaner 
cannot be stopped anymore, Schoenhuber stated. 
  Schoenhuber accused Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central 
Council of Jews, of fanning anti-Semitism in the FRG. There is 
no collective guilt for the crimes of the Nazi period. "Today's 
Germany is not guilty. Our only crime in world history was that 
we lost two world wars," Schoenhuber said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The number of crimes motivated by 
xenophobia has risen again after a temporary decline. As the 
Federal Government reported on Wednesday [16 February] in 
response to an inquiry by the Party of Democratic Socialism, the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigations registered 335 such 
crimes last December. In October, 267 were registered, 
following 296 in September. The figure for November has not yet 
been published in the Bundestag, the response said. 
  The 335 crimes in December consisted of 16 arson attacks, 39 
attacks against persons, and 280 "other crimes," such as 
material damage or insults. A total of 176 suspects were 
reported. 
  According to the Federal Government, during the third 
quarter 
of last year 7,076 investigations were initiated for right-wing 
extremist or xenophobic crimes, 25 of them for murder or 
manslaughter, 305 for bodily injury, 67 for arson, 172 for 
offenses against the laws relating to civil disorders and 
rioting, and 217 for anti-Semitic activities. A total of 2,250 
investigations dealt with the dissemination of propaganda by 
organizations which are hostile to the constitution; 1,915 dealt 
with active demagogy, dissemination of publications dealing with 
violence, or instigation to racial hated; and 2,124 dealt with 
"other" crimes. According to the Federal Government, 3,900 
investigations were discontinued -- mostly because it was 
impossible to find a perpetrator.

<F P=106> [Article by Herve Algalarrondo: "The Confusion of Headmaster </F>
Balladur"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] It was a prime minister 
singularly ignorant of French passions that was present all 
through the remake of the school war [reform of the Falloux law 
providing for state financing of private schools]. Of course, 
Balladur can argue that he did not like the reform. He gave into 
his majority. But the lay torrent that was unleashed plunged him 
into an abyss of perplexity. An eminently reasonable man, 
Balladur is fearful of the irruption of the irrational in the 
political debate. 
  The mastery of communication skills he has shown since March 
1993 has obscured the fact that the prime minister is a neophyte 
in politics. Unlike Francois Mitterrand or [Rally for the 
Republic leader] Jacques Chirac, he lacks decades spent in the 
provinces in his background. His knowledge of France is not 
carnal. A simple councilman in Paris, he cannot even be seen as 
really locally chosen. Outside ministerial cabinets, Balladur 
has only frequented the world of the companies. [passage omitted] 
  Today, Balladur has learned to consult polls. But let their 
predictions not come true, and the prime minister finds himself 
without a compass. 
  All the more so since he has formed a cabinet in his image. 
While agile spirits abound around him, most are known for their 
total lack of knowledge of the terrain. A very "Balladurian" 
minister noted last week that the "Matignon" [prime minister's 
office] lacks one or two experienced men who would anticipate 
low blows. Such sentinels would be useful because, contrary to 
common belief, Balladur grants a lot of freedom to his flock. 
Because he has learned to like television platforms and eclipsed 
the government, some people deduced that the ministers were only 
shadows. Wrong: they have regained a power lost since Pompidou. 
A member of a ministerial cabinet under Giscard d'Estaing notes: 
"At that time, a minister was unable to promise a cent without 
the green light of an Elysee [president's office] adviser. On 
the contrary, Balladur has let his ministers become responsible. 
He trusts us." 
  The prime minister told the members of his cabinet that they 
should not be replacements for the government. He himself opted 
for rather loose control. Balladur preaches 
"interministeriality." In his view, the prime minister's 
intervention is only justified if there is a conflict between 
two ministers. 
  But let a minister propose an apparently well-planned 
project 
and claim it can be carried out, and Balladur easily gives the 
green light. [passage omitted] This is one of the main reasons 
for the infatuation numerous ministers feel for their leader. 
They have the feeling of being real bosses, not just simple 
cogs. But it is surely also one of the reasons for the 
dysfunctions noted in the government's action in the last nine 
months: the absence of a filter. An absence all the more 
damaging given that a number of ministers have revealed 
themselves to be inexperienced, if not downright deficient. With 
the Matignon's lack of flair, this will probably remain the main 
lesson of the Falloux episode: Professor Balladur is singularly 
lax with his small governmental class.

  [Text] Interior Minister Charles Pasqua played a 
determining role in the Paris visit of Tariq `Aziz last October. 
Iraq's number two man, officially in Paris to seek medical 
attention, had numerous political and economic conversations. At 
an emergency meeting of the appropriate ministers, it had been 
decided that no contact would take place. The decision came too 
late: Pasqua had already met with `Aziz the previous day.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Claude Imbert: "Fear"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Can anyone really understand what the 
establishment of a theocratic republic in Algiers would mean? 
The flight in the direction of France of the Algerian elite 
(which has already started). The reinforcement of fundamentalist 
networks in France ensured of logistical support from Algiers. 
The multiplication of Syrian, Libyan, Iranian threat, that is, 
of state terrorism. It is not our pathetic return to Tehran of 
two Iranians claimed in vain by Swiss justice that will reassure 
us. Because, faced with terrorism, democracies, too, are afraid. 
  I lack the means or the intention to discuss the validity of 
a "reason of state" that freed the culprits. On the other hand, 
what is certain is that continuing to slide on this slope leads 
to an abyss. One would like that another "reason of state" deal 
with the real means to "terrorize the terrorists." Against a 
secret and pitiless war, democracies must endow themselves with 
the means of a secret and pitiless war. And one should not do 
like the ostrich when faced with the threat, but find the 
political will to resist. No little Munichs of the mind should 
be allowed. Nowadays, there is no worse misfortune, in politics, 
than the decline of courage. We have enough cunning to sell 
some. But what about courage? [passage omitted]

Under Investigation"] 
  [Text] Livorno, 7 Feb (ANSA) -- The Defense Ministry is 
investigating alleged misappropriation and financial wrongdoing 
in contracts for and shipping of food supplies to Italian 
soldiers in Somalia, the former commander of Italian troops with 
the United Nations mission in Somalia, General Bruno Loi, 
revealed Monday [7 February]. "I know that an investigation has 
been under way for some time by Rome army magistrates 
responsible for Somalia," Loi told journalists here, adding: "we 
have total and absolute trust in the magistrature." 
  Loi said he did not know the details of the investigation 
but 
confirmed that Italian troops did receive some shipments of 
spoilt meat, which had to be destroyed "following specific 
bureaucratic procedures." 
  Judicial sources disclosed that magistrates are evaluating 
reports of over-pricing and false bills issued by private 
contractors for food supplies to the military by and the alleged 
sale by Italian soldiers of meat, officially listed as spoilt, 
to soldiers of other countries posted in Somalia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Contri in Sarajevo on Adoption, Aid </F>
Truce Moves"] 
  [Text] Rome, 15 Feb (ANSA) -- Italy's Minister for Social 
Affairs Fernanda Contri today had talks in the Bosnian capital 
Sarajevo on moves to start a "long-distance adoption" programme 
for Bosnian children and set up a possible "aid truce" alongside 
the military cease-fire so that much-needed supplies can reach 
Sarajevo by land or air from Split. 
  In talks with Bosnian Social Affairs Minister Arif Smajkic 
and Health Minister Mustafa Beganovic, Contri discussed the 
practicalities of an adoption programme that would prevent 
children from being wrenched from a familiar, if war-torn, 
environment. She told reporters that another focus of the talks 
was the "aid truce" proposal, within the context of Italian 
Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta's proposal to hold an 
international meeting of social affairs ministers in Florence. 
  Accompanied by the extraordinary intervention chief at the 
Italian foreign ministry's development aid department, Vitaliano 
Napoleone, Contri also had talks with UN High Commission for 
Refugees (UNHCR) Sarajevo coordinator Anthony C. Land, who said 
the Bosnian capital was at present only receiving two-thirds of 
the food and half the medical supplies it needs. 
  Land thanked the Italian government for its efforts in 
support of the evacuation of wounded, which "Italy is 
implementing to a much higher degree than other countries." He 
said that, despite the cease-fire, aid to Sarajevo was still 
being held up by security problems. 
  Throughout the day of talks, as snow fell heavily on the 
city, sounds of gunfire were faint and extremely sporadic. 
  At the end of their talks, the two social affairs ministers 
signed an accord on humanitarian initiatives to protect Bosnian 
children from the effects of the fighting. The accord also aims 
to "stimulate the commitment of all sides to the military 
cease-fire", a communique said. The two ministers issued an 
appeal to Europe and the international community to support 
fresh aid convoys from Split to Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnian Ambassador Wants More Active </F>
Role For Italy"] 
  [Text] Bergamo, 13 Feb (ANSA) -- The Bosnian ambassador to 
Switzerland, Mohammed Filipovic, declared here that Italy should 
take on a more active role in Bosnia-Herzegovina as the head of 
Italy's CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] trade union 
confederation proposed sending workers to Sarajevo for the May 1 
Labor Day holiday. 
  At a study seminar organized by the CISL confederation, in 
this city northeast of Milan, the visiting ambassador was 
welcomed by the assembly with a long round of standing applause. 
"We want a more active role for the Italian government, which 
must be much more involved in peace in Bosnia," declared 
Filipovic who said the Rome government should take on a 
"leadership role." 
  On the sidelines of the seminar, Cabinet Undersecretary 
Antonio Maccanico said, "At the level of humanitarian relief, 
Italy is perhaps doing more than any other European country for 
Bosnia." 
  In his statement, the Bosnian ambassador spoke of living in 
"stone age" conditions in the ex-Yugoslav republic, "forced to 
live without water, light, gas, food. And when they go to look 
for them, they are killed by the artillery of the Serbian 
troops," he said in the dead silence of the hall. "We will 
never accept anything that is not freedom and democracy for our 
country. We want peace...with a political solution," declared 
Filipovic who noted that canons only serve to prolong the war. 
  The ambassador, who was invited here by the Bergamo Refugees 
Committee, began distributing Bosnian passports over the weekend 
to fellow nationals holding Yugoslav passports, which were 
declared invalid as of January 1. Bosnian refugees from around 
Italy were arriving here to join some 150 fellow refugees 
already in the city. 
  For its part, the CISL urged the other two big trade union 
confederations, the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of 
Labor] and the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], to join 
in the organization of a May 1 for Italian workers in Sarajevo, 
the war- torn Bosnian capital, an event which, according to 
planners, will be broadcast live to Italy. 
  D'Antoni said Italian planning for the day should go ahead 
if 
the European Trade Union Confederation failed to take the 
initiative at the European level, because of differences within 
the organization. "Conditions within ex-Yugoslavia are so 
dramatic that everyone must do something," declared the CISL 
leader.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nimr Hammad, PLO representative in Italy, by </F>
Barbara Stefanelli on 14 February; place not given: "`Italy: 
PLO Must Not Close Down'"] 
  [Text] "Peace has passed through Italy many times. It is 
here that we have met and here that we learned to talk to each 
other. It is 20 years, you know, 20 years of work on this shore 
of the Mediterranean. Did you know that from 1974 through the 
great changes of 1993 many of the Arab and Israeli protagonists 
first met in your country? It is for the sake of all this that 
we are now saying: The Palestinian Embassy in Rome must not 
close." 
  Nimr Hammad, the PLO representative in Italy, would really 
rather not do so ("we have our pride"), but is being forced to 
request help. When he returned to his office yesterday morning 
at the end of the weekend, there was a letter from ENEL 
[National Electric Power Board] waiting for him on his desk: 
The line will be cut off within a matter of hours unless 
several months of debts are paid off "immediately." 
  [Stefanelli] Does your headquarters in Tunis not help you? 
Or has it issued an order for you to close? 
  [Hammad] We can no longer pay the rent, expense, and staff 
wages. Our 12 staff have not been paid since last summer. The 
point is that it is not our problem alone: The economic crisis 
is affecting the whole PLO. I have just spoken by telephone 
with Chairman 'Arafat, and he expressed to me his personal 
regret and sadness. But there are no funds either for Rome or 
for the other embassies around the world. 
  [Stefanelli] Rome is closing down, with the offices in 
Africa 
and Scandinavia. Paris, London, and Brussels are remaining 
open. Would you say, perhaps, that Italy has become a less 
important crossroads for international diplomacy? 
  [Hammad] Oh, no, definitely not. Paris and London were in 
danger of closing, too. But at the last moment some benefactors 
-- Palestinians or Arabs -- intervened and paid their bills. 
Unfortunately our community in Italy is not so wealthy. As for 
Brussels, it was the European Parliament that salvaged us. 
  Here in Rome many people have promised to help us, but 
ultimately we received something only from the trade unions -- 
the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] and the CISL 
[Italian Confederation of Trade Unions]. It is thanks to their 
support that we have managed to keep going since May, when the 
crisis occurred. What can we do now? We can hope that your 
government will allow us not to pay the rent and telephone bills 
for a transitional period. Or we could use a special loan, which 
the PLO would pledge to repay when the Palestinian state is 
formed, when we have our own taxes, regular revenue. 
  [Stefanelli] How long will it take before this regular 
revenue starts coming in? 
  [Hammad] I would say six or seven months. Four months from 
when the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho really begins, 
then another three months in which to organize ourselves. It 
must not be thought that the moment 'Arafat sets foot in 
Palestine everything will work perfectly and at once. We must 
expect a period of instability. But then we will settle our 
debts. Funds envisaged by the World Bank and other financial 
institutions must also be released. This is a temporary lack of 
money. 
  [Stefanelli] But did Saudi Arabia not resume its funding 
after 'Arafat's recent visit to Riyadh? 
  [Hammad] There has been a rapprochement, but no money. 
  [Stefanelli] What did the chairman advise you to do when you 
spoke on the telephone? 
  [Hammad] Unless a miracle occurs in the next few days, at 
the 
end of February I will have to close the office and transfer the 
PLO headquarters to my own home. I will try to work from there. 
This certainly is a cruel joke: This is all happening at a 
time when we Palestinians are preparing to become a state. And 
a real state -- no longer in exile -- must strengthen its 
embassies. 
  [Stefanelli] Would a visit by 'Arafat to Italy not help the 
"cause" of the Rome office? 
  [Hammad] It would certainly strengthen us. We are organizing 
one, and contacts have already been made with the government in 
Tunis. I cannot give you a date, but it is not far away. 
[Hammad ends] 
  With or without 'Arafat, the race against time has begun. 
The PLO, at the very time when it is marching toward peace, has 
two weeks in which to avoid closing the doors of its Italian 
home.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cuts in Aid to Agriculture"] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 7 Feb (ANSA) -- Once again the lack of 
controls has compromised European Community aid to Italy which 
will receive 586.1 billion lire less from FEOGA, the fund that 
finances the common agricultural policy. 
  The Agricultural Ministry today noted that the cut came in 
line with the November 1993 decision on the part of the European 
Commission to liquidate the 1990 acccounts and stressed that 
every year Italy suffers the biggest reductions in FEOGA funds 
because of failure to respect Community controls and the terms 
within which payments must be made.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Too Many Missions: The Navy Asks for </F>
More Money"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The Navy involved in Yugoslavia? Our 
soldiers are certainly not backing out but, on behalf of all of 
them, Admiral Angelo Mariani, chief of general staff, said: 
"All we want is for the Navy to be given the means to fulfill 
its task properly. We are concerned -- but, frankly, we are 
more than just concerned -- that our men's commitment and 
professionalism will not be enough if in the meantime the right 
choices are not made in terms of investment and equipment." 
  According to a report on the state of the Army, in 1993 the 
defense budget amounted to 25.56 trillion lire [L]. The Navy 
absorbed L3.458 trillion, which represents 19 percent of overall 
expenditure. Forecasts for 1994 confirm the budget is 
shrinking. The assumed availability of L26.167 trillion for 
defense means a 2.4 percent increase in monetary terms, but this 
amounts to a reduction in real terms. Allocations for the Navy 
should be in the region of L3.513 trillion, representing an 
increase of 1.6 percent in monetary terms, which is not even 
enough to offset predicted inflation levels. 
  Operations in the Adriatic Sea in connection with war in the 
former Yugoslavia have represented the most important commitment 
in strategic, political, and organizational terms. The Navy 
took part in these missions right from the start, committing 
ships and aircraft, and two of its admirals were in command of 
the two allied naval task forces that were initially deployed. 
  Effective control of the makeup and destination of cargo 
ships began in November 1992, following the UN decision to 
strengthen the measures aimed at enforcing the embargo. The 
Navy was involved in the "Sharp Guard" operation, for which it 
continuously provided three to four naval units and two to three 
aircraft for patroling purposes. 
  As far as Albania is concerned, in 1993 the Navy was engaged 
in continuous control operations to prevent any illegal mass 
migration into Italy. Furthermore, in 1993 another 180 minor 
missions were carried out, amounting to as many days out at sea.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Socialist Party Secretary Ottaviano </F>
Del Turco by Venanzio Postiglione in Milan; date not given: 
"The PSI Secretary Says the Left and the Center Can Beat the 
Right Through Local Agreements"] 
  [Text] Milan -- [Postiglione] Mr. Del Turco, have you heard 
the accusations? They say you are the smallest cog on the 
progressive wheel. So why have you joined the coalition? 
  [Del Turco] The smallest cog on the wheel? Nonsense! If 
anyone within the coalition attempts to disparage our 
traditions, then we will take back our banner and... 
  [Postiglione] And where will you go? 
  [Del Turco] We will stay on the left, but alone, without any 
coalitions. 
  [Postiglione] But do you really believe in a coalition 
ranging from [Democratic Alliance, AD, leader] Adornato to 
[Communist Renewal Chairman] Cossutta? 
  [Del Turco] Why not? Did anyone ever imagine [League 
Secretary] Bossi and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi joining 
forces? Or [Democratic Christian Center, CCD, members] Casini 
and Mastella beckoning to [National Alliance coordinator] Fini? 
We are a coalition, not a front. There was a front in 1948, 
and that experience was enough for us. [Del Turco ends] 
  "Let us regain our pride," read the largest banner. "We are 
becoming the manservants of those who have always hated us," 
Bobo Craxi and company were remarking bitterly. There was little 
applause for Ottaviano Del Turco -- little applause in the 
former Bribe City. He was taking it easy: "Milan is like 
Coventry after the bombings. Nothing is left standing. We must 
start again from scratch...." Delegates at the PSI's [Italian 
Socialist Party] provincial general meeting were murmuring, 
twisting about on their seats, taking opposite sides. What was 
to be done? Where could they go from here? What could they 
hope for? Del Turco has already made his choice: "We will be 
the moderate force within the left." However, the expression on 
his face was becoming increasingly grim. He was neither 
laughing nor smiling. "He almost looks like [Italian Popular 
Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli," someone in the audience 
was saying. 
  [Postiglione] Galli della Loggia wrote in CORRIERE DELLA 
SERA 
that AD's project failed. There is no democratic party -- only 
unity among the left-wing forces.... 
  [Del Turco] This is not so. He is wrong. AD has had its 
share of problems, like all other political forces. However, 
the people representing it, and its internal composition, lead 
it inevitably to form part of the progressive coalition. An 
attempt is being made to establish two different alignments. If 
we sit at the negotiating table, then they say that [Democratic 
Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Occhetto is dictating the 
rules. If we leave, then we are told that we are betraying the 
reform... They want to have it both ways! 
  [Postiglione] Will you find it easy, however, to put up with 
Communist Renewal? 
  [Del Turco] Wait a minute. An agreement is not an 
endorsement. 
  [Postiglione] Yes, but how can you implement an austerity 
policy with [Communist Renewal Deputy] Bertinotti? 
  [Del Turco] They have accepted things that were unthinkable 
even a short time ago, starting from privatization. You will 
see, if they want to govern the country, they will have to 
compromise on certain issues... 
  [Postiglione] Of course, you will also say that you want to 
see Ciampi as prime minister.... 
  [Del Turco] No, enough now. It makes no sense to mention his 
name. You are not rendering him a good service by doing so. 
Using him in the electoral campaign and turning him into a 
target for polemics is absolutely inappropriate. 
  [Postiglione] But do you want him as prime minister or not? 
  [Del Turco] Yes, of course. But I repeat: I should not want 
to use him, at any price, as a pawn in some internal game within 
the progressive coalition... What is new in politics, however, 
is something else... 
  [Postiglione] What? 
  [Del Turco] The agreement between Bossi and Berlusconi, 
which 
is leaving less room for [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and 
Martinazzoli, and is increasing the polarizing effect. 
  [Postiglione] What does this mean in real terms? 
  [Del Turco] We must work out local agreements to enable the 
center and the left to join forces and defeat the right-wing 
candidates, who have a clear head start. 
  [Postiglione] Why are the Socialists, meaning your 
Socialists, not joining Segni and Martinazzoli in the third pole? 
  [Del Turco] I first tried to understand whether they were 
showing any appreciation for our efforts, but not the smallest 
sign came from them... When I think that we always recognized 
and appreciated their efforts. 
  [Postiglione] Are they ungrateful, then? 
  [Del Turco] Yes, I think we may use such a term. 
  [Postiglione] However, in the meantime [former PSI member] 
Giuliano Amato has also joined the center. 
  [Del Turco] And he has made a big mistake. The electoral 
reform is adamant: It requires two blocks. It is within these 
two poles that the "moderating" influence must be exercised. 
This is precisely my role among the progressives. I have 
consulted with Adornato, and he agrees. If we stay, it is to 
enable a reformist platform to emerge. 
  [Postiglione] Craxi's former followers are furious. They are 
saying that "Del Turco has sold out to the PDS." 
  [Del Turco] Wrong. I spent 25 years within the CGIL [Italian 
General Confederation of Labor] -- a trade union where the PCI 
[Italian Communist Party] constituted a majority, and which was 
full of hardliners and purists. I was part of a minority, but I 
always defended the reformists' identity: I was never 
subordinate to anybody, neither to Lama nor to the others. 
Rather, they used to accuse me of the opposite. They said that 
I was too strong-minded. Why should I give in, now that I am 50, 
if I did not when I was 30 or 40? 
  [Postiglione] How many more Socialists, however, will you 
lose on the way? 
  [Del Turco] Perhaps those who know that there is no place 
for 
them within the progressive alliance. But the idea that some of 
them may join Berlusconi is unacceptable. Let me quote [PSI 
deputy] Intini: "Socialists can do all sorts of things, but one 
thing they cannot do is be under the orders of an employer." 
  [Postiglione] Did Berlusconi not give you a call? Did he not 
try to convince you, too? 
  [Del Turco] We spoke to each other, true. But he did not try 
to convince me of anything. He feels too much respect for me 
and my background. For the first time, he had to use a 
different kind of language with a PSI secretary. Why? It is no 
mystery: He was friends and buddies with the previous 
leadership. 
  [Postiglione] You also had relations with Craxi... 
  [Del Turco] I was never part of his circle of friends, 
everybody knows that. Also, I predicted what was going to 
happen. I remember my speech in Rimini, in 1988: "The party is 
now full of strange men: Enthusiasm for politics never shines 
in their eyes." 
  [Postiglione] Mr. Del Turco, were you not better off as a 
trade unionist? 
  [Del Turco] That was the best experience in my life. 
  [Postiglione] Are you enjoying yourself now? 
  [Del Turco] No, I have not enjoyed it even for a single day. 
Never. My task is to salvage a piece of Italian history, carry 
reformist socialism into the next parliament. If I succeed, 
everybody will get recognition for success. If I fail, it will 
be my fault.

<F P=106> [Francesco Verderami report: "D'Alema Calls the State of </F>
the Entente `Catastrophic'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Passed over in Tuscany, ruined in Sicily, 
broken in Piedmont, not even open in Calabria: The progressive 
table is like a sports bar, where someone sitting down to 
discuss is certain to leave with his ideas unchanged. In this 
way, on the left, they talk and meet, without achieving an 
agreement, in a babel of angry declarations and accusations of 
bribery and of using methods typical of "Manuale Cencelli" 
[Christian Democrat powersharing method]. For Massimo D'Alema 
one word was enough to comment on the current state of the 
alliance of the left: "Catastrophic." Yes, of course, the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] floor leader is certain that "in 
the end the progressives will go united to the ballot box," and 
that "it is the right which has the problems," with the "deadly 
tangle" between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, [Northern 
League Secretary] Bossi, and [National Alliance Secretary] Fini. 
But a man of the left like Diego Novelli cannot remain unmoved 
by the fact that the "glorious war machine" has become stranded. 
"In Piedmont the AD [Democratic Alliance] has put forward three 
candidates, two of whom have drastically changed their political 
views. And then there are the `parachuted candidates,' the 
`disguised' PDS candidates. What a sad situation. We are in a 
political pharmacopoeia." Novelli's accusations are directed 
"at everyone, including the Rete." Which in Sicily has blown 
the negotiations into the air, wanting the majority of the 
uninominal seats for itself. Oscar Giannino, the AD's major 
republican representative, is convinced that "[Rete Secretary] 
Orlando is aiming for a split, in order to repropose the 
two-party agreement with the Greens," advanced a few weeks back 
by [Greens coordinator] Ripa di Meana. "And if the Greens are 
smart, they will agree." "Rather than split," comments Petro 
Folena, "the Rete is tending progressively to exclude the 
allies, a strategy which risks being a losing one, while 
Berlusconi has already landed in Sicily and is making agreements 
with the Mafia families." A weighty denunciation from the PDS 
deputy, which basically sums up how the PDS intends to respond 
to the offensive from the right. A tactic which does not at all 
please [AD deputy] Giorgio Bogi: "Let us have done with this lie 
of the democratic emergency. The fact is that for the first 
time in Italy the right has a credible government proposal. 
Berlusconi is the Italian Thatcher of the nineties and one 
cannot reply to such a challenge with an alliance of numbers. 
Right now, to win, the progressives need to put up [Prime 
Minister] Ciampi against Berlusconi." 
  Nominating Ciampi in the progressive pole is like lighting a 
match in an arsenal. "But are the AD's people on the moon?" 
communist Crucianelli smiles. "Perhaps we can consider a 
transitional government with Ciampi as prime minister and 
D'Alema as minister of the interior, given that, as far as I 
know, this means a lot to Massimo. But they will do this after 
the elections and without us." That is, without the Communist 
Renewal, Rete, and the Greens. These are already playing with 
blocking possible legislative moves in the next parliament. 
Indeed Ripa di Meana has asked the allies to sign an 
"anticorruption pact," in order to pledge to block any law in 
the coming parliament which would look like it was "wiping the 
slate" for people involved in bribery and corruption scandals. 
This is someone who, in the progressive pole, is looking to the 
day after tomorrow. But tomorrow is already uncertain. To 
blame: quarrels about seats. An example: At Livorno, the 
Greens wanted to put up Paissan, only the AD has requested the 
constituency for Passigli. Paissan ought then to stand at Pisa, 
except that Pisa has become a difficult seat, because the 
progressives could find themselves running against [Forza Italia 
candidate] Tiziana Parenti. In the meantime the Socialist 
Renewal is asking for 12 seats and the Rome-Tiburtino 
constituency, a PDS fief already assigned to pro-Occhetto Famoli. 
  And then there is the question of the "independents." In 
Sicily the Rete does not want to know about considering the 
Oscar producer Giuseppe Tornatore, an independent: "He is in 
the PDS quota," they say. In Rome, precisely in order to 
overcome the problem, the Renewal took it on itself to consider 
former USI [Independent Socialist Union] Giuseppe Giulietti as 
being in the Renewal quota. But at Pescara, the Abruzzi 
communists, it appears, want nothing to do with Miriam Mafai, 
whom the AD is proposing as an "independent" candidate.

  [Text] Expelled from the party? Claudio Signorile, Biagio 
Marzo, and other PSI [Italian Socialist Party] deputies and 
leaders in Puglia are convinced that they have been, and some of 
them are talking about "red Khomeynism" and "Stalinist methods," 
threatening to take the matter to law. One curious, 
paradoxical, and in its own way ruthless, aspect is that the 
person who drew up the dossier against Signorile and passed it 
on to the disciplinary board was Fabrizio Cicchitto, [PSI 
Secretary] Del Turco's board member in Puglia, for many years 
Signorile's most faithful ally on the party's left wing. 
  The affair arose out of the setting up, by Signorile and 
company, of the Federative Socialist Union, which Cicchitto 
claims is a front for an attempt on the part of many of those 
involved to stand for the forthcoming election in a deal with 
the center and Forza Italia, against the progressive alliance 
that the PSI has joined. Cicchitto maintains that this 
"automatically" places them outside the party. 
  Menchinelli, chairman of the PSI disciplinary board, 
emphasizes, however, that there is no question of expulsion. 
The reason is simple: Those concerned have not applied to join 
Del Turco's born-again PSI, and "As long as they consider 
themselves de facto outside the party, no action can be taken 
against them."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Democratic Alliance Returns to </F>
Progressive Front"] 
  [Text] Rome, 10 Feb (ANSA) -- The Democratic Alliance 
grouping will join the Progressives, the left-wing cartel to 
present joint candidates for the March 27 general elections, 
Democratic Alliance leader Ferdinando Adornato said Thursday [10 
February]. 
  Democratic Alliance chiefs were amongst those of eight 
parties which recently announced the formation of the 
Progressive cartel, but the loose grouping of left-wing 
intellectuals withdrew its support shortly after, in protest 
over positions struck by the Progressives. 
  Today's decision to return to the fold came after assurances 
from the other parties in the cartel, which is dominated by the 
Left Democrat Party, that the Progressives would continue with 
the economic recovery programme set in motion by current Premier 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. 
  Also important were guarantees from the Left Democrats on 
elements in the cartel's programme, and on candidate selection.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pact for Italy leader Mario Segni by </F>
Maurizio Caprara in Rome; date not given: "Segni: I Am Not 
Making Any Purges But I Want More Credibility"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Caprara] Segni, first there 
were the embraces, then sparks started to fly between you and 
[Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli. What 
conflicts with the PPI still remain unresolved? 
  [Segni] The strategy behind the Pact for Italy, the real 
reason for its existence, the strategy that prevails over the 
difficulties, is the formation of a moderate European force that 
is both liberal-democratic and reformist. In short, an 
anchorage for serious government. A "broad right wing," made up 
in reality of entities that are irreconcilable, has now joined 
the inconsistent left front and there is a greatly increased 
need for a credible force. 
  [Caprara] The fact remains that you are quarreling over 
candidacies. Martinazzoli thinks it is unfair to lump together 
all those under investigation, and warns of "the harshness of 
purges." 
  [Segni] I have never been an admirer of Khomeyni. It is a 
question of giving a little more, since the parties have lost 
their validity. Of course that calls for sacrifices at the 
human level, too. But they are necessary to restore credibility 
to politics. 
  [Caprara] You have demanded all these sacrifices from the DC 
[Christian Democratic Party] left-wingers: [former DC Chairman] 
De Mita, [Interior Minister] Mancino, [Sicily Regional 
Secretary] Mattarella. Bodrato says: "They are using the moral 
issue to get rid of those who might end up on the right." Is 
that not a political decision? 
  [Segni] That is an unfounded interpretation. 
  [Caprara] Why are you objecting to people under 
investigation 
from other teams? 
  [Segni] I am not making a personal issue of it and I am 
truly 
sorry that some people interpret it thus. 
  [Caprara] Your opponents are talking about you and saying: 
"Why must we be `renewed' while he has been a parliamentarian 
for five legislative terms and is staying on?" 
  [Segni] To tell the truth I have never pondered on the 
problem of parliamentary terms. In a phase of change, there 
must be a high level of renewal but also elements of continuity. 
However painful it may be, the problem is the appropriateness 
of certain candidacies. My place, however, is still available. 
  [Caprara] In the PPI primaries in Irpinia, De Mita's 
candidacy was seconded by 8,142 people, and Mancino's by 4,322. 
Are they not also flesh-and-blood voters? 
  [Segni] I have always said that at an epoch-making turning 
point, it is necessary to make a change from those who 
represented the previous system. Let it be very clear that 
this is not a judgment. It is a political requirement. And it 
is certainly a very strong one if the Pact for Italy wants to 
win. 
  [Caprara] Did you expect to have a united bloc, of the type 
that is emerging now, on your right ? 
  [Segni] I think that Sartori's article in CORRIERE DELLA 
SERA 
was perfect. What has been formed is not a political bloc. It 
is not a liberal-democratic area, it is a conglomeration. 
[Northern League Secretary] Bossi talks with [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi, and Berlusconi talks with [National Alliance 
Coordinator] Fini, but Bossi will not shake hands with Fini. It 
is impossible for them to have a common program. It is not just 
the enormous gap in their views on Italian unity. 
  [Caprara] What other differences do you see? 
  [Segni] Is the MSI [Italian Social Movement] as in favor of 
free trade as Berlusconi? Quite the opposite. The 
inconsistencies on the left, in a lineup ranging from [Italian 
Republican Party Chairman] Visentini to [Communist Renewal 
Secretary] Bertinotti, are reflected on the right. We are more 
consistent, that is why we are suffering more. We know exactly 
what to do once we have gotten into government, whereas a split 
is already a certainty on the other sides. 
  [Caprara] You once said that the Pact is an alternative to 
the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. After the election 
would you form an alliance to govern with Bossi and Berlusconi? 
  [Segni] We are asking for votes for ourselves and for our 
programs. I do not know what will happen if none of the three 
blocks achieves a majority. There may be a government of 
technocrats to safeguard the nation, that will complete the 
institutional reforms and ensure governability. What is certain 
is that we will be moving in a specific direction, united 
whether in government or in opposition. 
  [Caprara] Does this mean that the PPI cannot form an 
alliance with the PDS? 
  [Segni] Exactly. And that is why we have decided to form a 
single parliamentary group even if it takes the form of a 
federation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "D'Alema of PDS Placed Under </F>
Investigation"] 
  [Text] Rome, 16 Feb (ANSA) -- Massimo D'Alema, the House 
whip for the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and considered 
the party's Number Two, has been placed under investigation 
along with eight others in connection with the investigation 
into illicit party funding, judicial sources said here today. 
  D'Alema this morning made a spontaneous appearance, 
accompanied by his attorney Guido Calvi, before Public 
Prosecutor Vittorio Mele, to give his version of the accusations 
made by former Socialist Partly leader and ex-Premier Bettino 
Craxi on alleged under-the-table contributions to the ex-Italian 
Communist Party (PCI), now the PDS. 
  Craxi recently presented a dossier to the justice department 
formally presenting his claims, already voiced on the floor of 
parliament, which must now be investigated to ascertain whether 
they are true or whether he should be indicted for slander. 
  The others Craxi claims were aware of the illicit 
contributions included PDS secretary Achille Occhetto and PDS 
administrative secretary Marcello Stefanini. 
  According to Craxi, the PCI and PDS received kickbacks for 
the so-called "Red Cooperatives" after they were awarded public 
contracts.

<F P=106> [Arrigo Levi commentary: "Doubts and Duty"] </F>
  [Text] Serbs, beware: The time for the NATO air raids on 
Serbian forces in Bosnia is gradually approaching. If the Serbs 
ignore -- as they have in the past -- the ultimatums that the 
United Nations, NATO, and Europe will issue to them once again 
before ordering their aircraft to take off from their Italian 
bases, the operation will be carried out. 
  Those, like myself, who have many doubts about the 
effectiveness of such an intervention, and who perceive all its 
unknown factors and dangers, must now forcefully stress the 
following new factor: After the latest deliberate and 
intolerable massacre of civilians in Sarajevo and after the 
stances adopted by Butrus-Ghali, the European Union, and Bill 
Clinton, there can no longer be any doubt that the Western 
democracies are preparing soon to cross the fatal threshold of 
an air operation. Then whatever will be, will be. And if the 
Serbs do not understand what is about to happen, they are making 
a big mistake. 
  The Serbs have many reasons for continuing to delude 
themselves. Too many past threats have not been followed up by 
deeds. And also there are too many gray areas that still prompt 
many people to doubt the Western governments' determination. 
These have taken turns in putting forward and rejecting the 
idea of raids. Last spring America was ready to carry out 
bombardments, but the French and British, who have thousands of 
men in the former Yugoslavia (inadequately armed in order to be 
invulnerable) opposed it. They said, and rightly so, that the 
effectiveness of raids was doubtful, the risk of hitting 
civilians too high, and the threat to the blue helmets 
unacceptable; and nothing was done. 
  Now Paris and London seem to have changed their minds. But 
still three days ago U.S. Defense Secretary Perry was voicing 
reservations, asking: "Our strike capability is not in 
question, but what would be the political result of the 
bombardments? If they were to be the first act in a new 
tragedy, what would be the second and third acts, and what would 
the conclusion be?" 
  It is all too easy to portray alarming scenarios. In 
response to NATO bombardments ordered by the United Nations, we 
must expect Serbian attacks on the blue helmets throughout 
Bosnia. What will NATO and the United Nations do then? 
Immediately after the massacre in Sarajevo Perry stressed: 
"The United States and NATO are unwilling to send armies into 
Sarajevo to impose an agreement against the will of the region's 
peoples." But if that is so, "what would the second and third 
acts be?" 
  There are many hypotheses. Is it likely that the major 
European powers would witness major attacks on their blue 
helmets without responding and that America would not rush in to 
help its allies and the United Nations? Alternatively, is it 
possible that the British, French, and all the other UN forces 
could escape from Bosnia, like the marines from Beirut? Would 
that not render inevitable the huge land operation, the "great 
war to end the little war" that all the democracies have 
hitherto deemed absurd and impracticable (and not out of 
cowardice but out of proper prudence)? 
<H5>  Promises and Ambiguities </H5>
  The Serbs, encouraged by Zhirinovskiy's crazy promises and 
Yeltsin's ambiguities, may believe that the democracies will not 
cross this Rubicon, that they will not send in the great army -- 
almost on a Gulf War scale -- that would be needed to impose 
peace in Bosnia. Nobody now can be sure that this will happen, 
but it is prudent to remember that democracies are by nature 
slow to respond to the defiance of the violent -- this, partly 
because ours are peaceful peoples who have suffered too many 
wars to throw themselves into another without pondering it. But 
at the last moment democracies have ultimately always responded 
to threats. And they have won all the major wars of this 
century. 
  We do not know whether, when they chose the script for the 
first act -- that of air strikes -- the NATO governments already 
set the scene for the second and third acts. And this 
uncertainty worries us. We would like them to have done so; and 
we would like it to be explained clearly to the democratic 
peoples why it is impossible to continue witnessing the 
massacres in Sarajevo -- which are, as American Secretary of 
State Christopher said, "part of a plan that the Serbian 
artillery has pursued despite repeated warnings from NATO" -- 
and we would also like them to explain what would be the cost of 
a land intervention, which could prove necessary in order not to 
lose all credibility, in order not to encourage all Europe's 
extremists and further violent actions. 
  This time, unless the Serbs yield and stop stifling 
Sarajevo, 
we believe that a bombardment is certain. Sometimes, as De 
Gaulle said, "you engage first, and then see what happens." 
<H5>  At the Negotiating Table </H5>
  The hope is that such a move, if it must be made, will not 
spark a vicious circle of reprisals but that it will bring 
everyone back to the negotiating table and make everyone at last 
accept the European Union's peace plan, which would restore 33 
percent of territory to the Bosnians, instead of the 22 percent 
that they now control. But perhaps the reserves of Balkan 
madness have not yet been exhausted. Soon we will know.

<F P=106> [Stefano Folli commentary: "Pact's Aim Now To Withstand </F>
Impact of Elections"] 
  [Text] It is not surprising that [Pact for Italy leader] 
Mario Segni devoted the sharpest parts of his speech yesterday 
to [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi and the errors 
committed by the media magnate and would-be politician. Over 
the past few days the winds of change have blown strong, and 
while Segni is launching his appeal to voters on the theme "we 
are the new," he must keep in mind that the scenario is changing. 
  The problem now is no longer just the PDS [Democratic Party 
of the Left], the greater or lesser distance that separates [PDS 
Secretary] Occhetto from [Communist Renewal Secretary] 
Bertinotti, the danger that the center will allow itself to be 
seduced by the progressive forces' arguments, their desire or 
ability to put themselves forward as an alternative. 
  Now Berlusconi's dizzying rise and the alliance rudely 
imposed on [League Secretary] Bossi (and tomorrow perhaps also 
on [National Alliance coordinator] Fini) confronts Segni's 
movement with a new and urgent problem. 
  Much more than [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] 
Martinazzoli's Popular Party, the Pact constitutes a border 
area. Segni's desire to "rally" votes to the center-right so as 
to justify a possible government agreement and his own personal 
leadership after the elections, has prompted him to explore 
League territory, thoroughly and boldly. But the famous 
document signed with [League lower house floor leader] Roberto 
Maroni, subsequently repudiated by Umberto Bossi, and, last 
again confirmed last night by Maroni as "still valid" seems to 
be no more than a worthless piece of paper. 
  The Berlusconi-Bossi political accord creates in the North 
that which Occhetto would call, with roles reversed, "a joyful 
war machine." Now everything is more difficult for Segni -- 
including the local "technical" alliances with the League and 
perhaps the Berlusconi grouping that he still believed in until 
a few days ago. They are still possible, of course, but on 
different conditions and with a clearer supremacy for Berlusconi 
over the Pact. 
  This is why Segni yesterday chiefly wanted to stress the 
"liberal democratic" character of the center -- first and 
foremost, with regard to principles, but also with regard to 
policy. Behind Berlusconi's offensive -- which is effectively 
taking over some of the themes propounded by Segni (free 
enterprise, the rejection of state control) -- there is the 
prime necessity to withstand the huge impact of the elections. 
The impact is damaging the Pact in the North, where several 
sectors are at present submitting to the temptation of reaching 
an agreement with the strongest. As Guido Bodrato so accurately 
put it, the center risks meeting the same fate as Poland, 
crushed and split between Hitler and Stalin. 
  This also explains why the most moderate members of the 
Popular Party, such as Formigoni and Buttiglione, were worried 
yesterday. On the one hand, there is the strategy of the 
center's approach, from still solid positions, toward the League 
and the Berlusconi group. On the other hand, there is the 
agreement between Berlusconi and Bossi and all that this entails. 
  It is not without significance that [Radical leader] Marco 
Pannella too has tried to drive a wedge into Berlusconi's war 
machine. By saying "no" to an alliance with Fini under any 
circumstances, Pannella's aim is to ruin the plan to encircle 
the Martinazzoli-Segni center. "Neither Fini nor Occhetto," the 
Radical leader is saying, in an attempt to recreate a political 
space that at the moment is in danger of running out of air. 
The paradox -- as Pannella well knows, and as Segni and 
Martinazzoli do, too -- is that the center would still remain 
strong at the tactical level. If, as many still believe, no 
definite winner emerges from the elections, the 
Catholic-nonconfessional group ("Only idiots believe that this 
is a new edition of the five-party alliance," Buttiglione 
protested yesterday) would have a crucial role to perform. 
  But unfortunately, the elections are before that. And 
Martinazzoli's and Segni's Poland, with their numerous 
nonconfessional allies, must withstand the convergent offensive 
being mounted by Berlusconi and Occhetto. This is the scenario 
of right-left polarization imposed by the situation -- the worst 
possible one for those performing an intermediate role, or who 
aspire to do so.

<F P=106> [Angelo Panebianco commentary: "The Language of the Left"] </F>
  [Text] Although, as [former IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli 
has correctly written, the defects of the right are many and 
serious, those of the left are equally numerous and serious. 
This too is worth considering. What seems to me to have been 
the gravest fault committed by [Democratic Party of the Left, 
PDS, Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema in 
this election campaign is that they -- nobody else -- have 
caused a new political boost to be imparted to anticommunism. 
Who could have plausibly used anticommunist arguments against 
the PDS if it had not allied with the neocommunists of Communist 
Renewal and the "Catholic-communists" [Catholic left-wingers] of 
Rete? Nor is it any good for Occhetto to reply that the 
American Democratic Party and Britain's Labor Party also contain 
extreme fringes. This, both because, as [Democratic Alliance 
leader] Ferdinando Adornato has said, in those parties the 
influence wielded by the extreme fringes absolutely cannot be 
compared to that of [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti and 
[Rete Secretary] Orlando within the cartel of left-wing forces 
and also, and above all, because neither the Democratic Party 
nor the Labor Party -- unlike the PDS -- was born out of the 
communist tradition, and therefore they do not need to defend 
themselves against the suspicion of links with that tradition. 
  Occhetto should ponder the following: If tomorrow [National 
Alliance leader] Fini were to suffer a breakaway on the right on 
the part of a group of diehard fascists, what would we say of 
him if he were then to ally with those same diehards in the 
elections? Having opted to facilitate unity on the left at all 
costs (on the basis of the theory that under the 
first-past-the-post system, it is only possible to win if 
united: no matter with whom) to the detriment of the pursuit of 
the average voter (who would have demanded strict limits in the 
left), the PDS may have -- though this is not certain -- gained 
a better chance of victory, but only by causing itself, and all 
Italians, to have to pay the price of perpetuating the 
communist-anticommunist split in Italian society and politics. 
This, all the more inasmuch as the PDS' alliance with Communist 
Renewal -- unlike what would have happened in the event of a 
contest between the two groups -- threatens to block the 
(inevitably slow) evolution of the political attitudes of PDS 
officials and members. Which are reflected in the language used 
by the PDS in this campaign. 
  All the key terms used by the PDS -- both those, such as 
"Progress" or "Democracy", which are accorded a positive 
connotation, and those, such as "Individualism" (always 
qualified as "unbridled") or "Economic Liberalism" (invariably 
"unrestrained"), which are accorded a negative connotation -- 
belong entirely, in this usage, to the traditional communist 
lexicon. D'Alema says that it is boorish for unreconstructed 
anticommunists to cite the lamentable argument of "communism," 
but in order to help them to correct such a serious fault, this 
boorishness, would it not be appropriate for the PDS to ask the 
nearest Public Health Office to carry out an urgent lexical 
"disinfection" program? This, since, although of course 
language says nothing about intentions (intentions can be 
concealed, and must in any case submit to changing 
circumstances), it does say some unmistakable things about the 
principles and political attitudes behind them. 
  But it is not of course merely a linguistic problem. There 
are (at least) three "areas" concerning which it is legitimate 
to worry about a possible victory by the left-wing forces. They 
concern the issues of state control, foreign policy, and the 
relationship between political authority and the judiciary. On 
the first point it seems clear to me that the left-wing cartel 
is adopting a position of "continuity" with respect to the 
course pursued by the First Republic. It is enough to consider 
the remarks made about the 1980's, the CAF [Cossiga, Andreotti, 
Fanfani] years. The left refers to them as years of 
"uncontrolled economic liberalism." What liberalism? The 
1980's were in fact years of state control -- unrestrained, too. 
Years when there was not a single instance of privatization 
(whereas this was taking place in other countries) and when 
dominion was exercised by the Single Party of Public 
Expenditure, of which, it must be pointed out, the PCI [Italian 
Communist Party] was also part, with the CAF. By taking issue 
with an economic liberalism that has never existed in this 
country, the left-wing cartel is sending an unambiguous message 
to the very many ramified vested interests at all levels of the 
social pyramid that are vitally dependent on public spending. A 
message of "continuity" (with respect to the Christian 
Democratic system of state control) instead of a change of 
course. 
  The second crucial "area" concerns foreign policy. Stances 
in this regard can only be fully assessed in crisis situations. 
Well, the PDS leadership has not said a single word of 
self-criticism about the stance adopted during the Gulf crisis. 
If a similar situation were to arise again, what would happen 
with the PDS in government? Would Italy undermine Western 
solidarity, with all the negative repercussions that this would 
entail for our country? It is not possible just to say, "let us 
forget about the past," as long as well-founded doubts about 
future conduct remain. 
  Last, the problem of the judiciary. I approach the issue, of 
course, with the circumspection and caution that are always 
obligatory when discussing the real centers of authority. In 
Bologna, the heart of the communist "regime" in our country, for 
instance, jokes are made (though these are whispered, and only 
to trusted friends, more or less as happens in totalitarian 
regimes) about the fact that the most incisive action in 
connection with illegal funding, kickbacks, and so forth has 
hitherto affected, as it so happens, a number of socialists and 
also Ciriaco de Mita's brother. We do not yet know what will 
happen in the Cusani case, but, to be frank, the worry is that 
in the event of a victory by the left-wing forces, the 
politico-judicial lobby known as the "magistrates' party" -- 
which is, of course, not the judiciary as a whole but, rather, a 
pressure group operating within it from positions of growing 
strength -- will succeed in imposing a "pact" between the ruling 
left-wing forces and the judicial authorities, more or less 
similar to that which existed between the DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] and the same authorities in the 1950's and 
1960's. When the advent of a totalitarian regime is feared, it 
is principally the possibility of such a pact that people have 
in mind. 
  I read in the newspapers the statement made by Angela 
Cavagna, a television starlet, who criticized parties that 
"change their coats but do not change their underwear." Alas, 
this is likely to remain absolutely the most accurate 
observation that has been made about this election campaign.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Progressives Win 10 of 13 Sicilian </F>
City Halls"] 
  [Text] Palermo, 14 Feb (ANSA) -- Voters in Sicily elected 
to office ten candidates running on progressive coalition slates 
in Sunday's [13 February] mayoral contests, two from the right, 
one middle-of-the roader and left one municipality without a new 
first citizen because of a Mafia threat. The run-offs were held 
in the bewildering absence of the old party symbols, abandoned 
by virtually all candidates to avoid association with such 
scandal-tainted parties as the Christian Democratic and 
Socialist parties, former powerhouses on the island. 
  In the only provincial vote yesterday, among the 14 mayoral 
run-offs on the island, 39.47 percent of the voters in the 
Catania province picked Nello Musumeci, the candidate for 
assembly president for the neofascist MSI [Italian Social 
Movement], over moderate Pact for Italy hopeful Stelio 
Mangiameli. Out of the turnout, which compared to 60.59 percent 
in the first round of balloting, 66.35 percent of the valid 
votes went to Musumeci, 38, who becomes province's 54th 
president. 
  Also captured by the right were the mayors' offices in 
Acireale and Acate with one, in Santa Teresa Riva, near Messina, 
taken by a moderate. 
  On the left, a mayoral candidate on a Democratic Party of 
the 
Left slate scored victory in Ribera to lead the way for the nine 
other left candidates awarded the keys to the offices in their 
municipalities. One, Vincenzo Lota', vied successfully in the 
town of Menfi against Guido Lo Porto, a member of the Rome Lower 
House for the neofascist MSI. 
  In Santa Lucia del Mela, moderate mayoral candidate 
Francesco 
La Camera dropped out of the race after the first round of 
voting when he received an unspecified Mafia threat, a move 
which prompted his fair-minded adversary, Santo Marcaione, to 
urge the townspeople to abandon the polling places. The voters 
here largely heeded the call and the turnout of 24.67 percent 
nullified the run-off because it fell far short of the 50 
percent turnout required by law. 
  Santa Lucia del Mela will try again in 90 days time, after 
the March 27 general elections for a new Rome parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pier Ferdinando Casini and Clemente </F>
Mastella, Italian Democratic Christian Center leaders, by Paola 
Di Caro; place and date not given: "The Centrists Raise Their 
Voices: We Want More Space in the Moderate Pole"] 
  [Text] Milan -- Now that the [Northern League Secretary] 
Bossi-[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi entente appears to be in 
the bag, the Christian Democratic Center's [CCD] spokesmen are 
displaying a certain perplexity as to the future of the "Pole of 
Freedom." They, partisans from the outset of an accord between 
all the center and center-right parties, now fear being crushed 
in the "mortal embrace" between Berlusconi and Bossi. And they 
fear that the exclusion of Fini's National Alliance from the 
electoral pact could prevent the victory of their lineup. Here 
are the doubts of Pier Ferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella, 
the CCD's leaders in the North and South respectively. 
  [Di Caro] Mr. Casini, what risks do you see in the 
League-Berlusconi alliance? 
  [Casini] I view as positive the go-ahead which the League's 
congress has given to the possibility of a liberal-democratic 
grouping, but the difficulty is coming now, as one attempts to 
put together varying political formulations. I want to find out 
what space exists in this grouping for liberal Catholics. And I 
want it to be clear that this is not a problem of names, of 
candidates. In this field, obviously, it is numbers which 
count. Nobody wants to deny the weight of the League in the 
North. But the problem lies elsewhere: We are not ready to 
accept political annexation. We were the first to enter the 
game because we want to build a political project. 
  [Di Caro] What concerns you in particular? 
  [Casino] I would premise my comments by stating that Bossi 
has a colorful language, and in what he says one has to 
distinguish between folklore and political substance. But I am 
having a hard time coming to terms with a tired antifascism, 
within a constitutional set-up which is being served up over 
again and which does not make sense today. Something has 
shifted to the right, and today a prejudiced "no" to an 
electoral grouping with the National Alliance is not acceptable. 
And then, naturally, one will have to evaluate what changing an 
electoral agreement into a political agreement to govern will 
eventually involve. One can win only by resolving these 
problems. 
  [Di Caro] Mr. Mastella, are you frightened by the 
League-Berlusconi embrace? 
  [Mastella] Certainly, if the alliance fails to respect our 
Catholic identity, or if a desire for hegemony emerges, then 
there will be problems. Our negotiations with the other 
representatives of the moderate pole remain open, and we are not 
forced to be part of a pact at any cost. But I would recall a 
single fact: According to the polls, the moderate pole has 35 
percent, and we have 4 percent. It is not so easy to do without 
the CCD. 
  [Di Caro] Whom do you fear more, Bossi or Berlusconi? 
  [Mastella] The danger certainly comes from the League. It is 
true that we are strongly rooted in the south, but we are a 
national party; that is why we wish to have a fair weight in the 
alliance. If, however, anyone raises his voice and in 
particular asks too much, also on the question of candidates, 
there will be serious problems. 
  [Di Caro] Bossi has closed the door on the MSI [Italian 
Social Movement]. 
  [Mastella] It is important to end the era of an excluding 
democracy, but also that of nostalgia, as it seems to me the 
National Alliance is doing. I believe that, in the electoral 
field, it is necessary to seek accords with this political force 
wherever it is possible. In the political field, in any case, 
one cannot deny that differences still exist between us and Fini.

<F P=106> [Article by Stefano Folli: "Center's Two Tendencies Play </F>
Key Match"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "The Pact's guarantor is [Pact for Italy 
leader] Segni. And if he leads the Pact it is he that must 
provide the pointers, otherwise...." This remark by one of 
Segni's close aides last night reflected the dramatic day 
experienced by the center. In an interview with IL MESSAGGERO, 
[Italian Popular Party, PPI, Deputy] Rocco Buttiglione offered 
the following significant viewpoint: RAI [state radio and 
television service] and Fininvest "have come to an agreement to 
attack the center, but this exposes Italy to disaster." 
  Buttiglione's anxiety reflects the real anguish currently 
pervading the moderate center of [PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli 
and Segni. Mortifying election figures are circulating -- the 
result of secret polls regarding whose reliability all doubts 
are justified, but whose psychological repercussions are 
obvious. The Pact and the PPI are in difficulty, both for 
general political reasons [Forza Italia leader] (Berlusconi's 
offensive) and because of the complex problem of the candidates. 
On this latter point their agreement is in serious trouble, and 
indeed there is a fierce conflict, as was shown by yesterday's 
meeting between Segni and Martinazzoli. 
  The first and second aspects are more closely connected than 
they may appear. [Senate Speaker] Giovanni Spadolini yesterday 
went so far as to compare the present climate to that of 1948 -- 
"The climate described by Guareschi, with Peppone and Don 
Camillo." This was a paradoxical way of indicating the same 
danger as Buttiglione cited -- the disappearance of the center, 
crushed like pre-war Poland by the impact of two giants. 
Indeed, if Italy really does venture into the unexplored 
territory of bipolarity, between Berlusconi and [Democratic 
Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Occhetto, the moderates will 
have too small an electoral territory to be able to guarantee 
the survival of the species. On the other hand, there would be 
substantial political scope after the election if parliament 
failed to produce a definite majority. 
  Thus the center's internal balance -- that is, the 
substantive relationship between the new Popular Party and the 
Pact -- would become the crucial factor, both in order to 
prevent the elections from proving a failure and above all in 
choosing what role to perform in the next parliament. Behind 
the conflict between Martinazzoli and Segni over the 
investigatees, the "new faces," and the unity of the future 
parliamentary group, one can perceive the outlines of a more 
troublesome political problem. Segni is trying to prevent the 
imprint of the new populist left from becoming decisive in the 
Pact-PPI alliance. Martinazzoli is concerning himself with 
defending the de facto hegemony of the Catholic-Popular Party 
group over the Segni group and will not accept any vetoes that 
would alter the characteristics of the relationship. 
  From this viewpoint, the Mattarella case is symbolic. By 
attacking him, Segni is trying to bring down one of the leaders 
of the PPI's internal left, even at the cost of appearing like a 
"executioner," as Martinazzoli warned yesterday evening. What 
is at stake is not only the image but also the political 
proposal to be put to the voters. Segni can feel Berlusconi 
hard on his heels, as he starts to encroach on Pact territory, 
especially in the first- past-the-post constituencies of central 
Italy on which the moderate centrists are pinning their last 
remaining hopes. In order to withstand the increasingly tough 
struggle, the Pact leader needs to expand a little to the right. 
The main objective is to salvage his vote, and the subsidiary 
objective is to have sufficient strength and credibility to 
negotiate a possible future armistice with the expanding enemy. 
  But there is also the problem of the future. Depending on 
the new parliamentary group's composition, on who constitutes 
it, this or that policy line will enjoy credibility. Segni 
still clings to his vision of a moderate rally that he can lead. 
Martinazzoli, custodian of the PPI identity, is willing to 
accept being confined to a small minority, but remains loyal to 
his option for the center-left. The former is looking toward 
the public tempted by Berlusconi, while the latter is thinking 
-- like Spadolini and Amato -- about the problematic balances in 
the next parliament.

<F P=106> Article by Marco Cecchini: "The PDS Pushes Olivetti Towards </F>
STET"] 
  [Text] PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and data 
processing: an exceptional union for a great marriage. 
According to the PDS there is a solution to Italy's data 
processing problems: it is through the creation of a 
megastructure formed by none other than STET [Turin Telephone 
Finance Company] and Olivetti. An indissoluble union of public 
and private. 
  The PDS plan is contained in a document that is still "top 
secret," to which the party's industrial experts are still 
adding the finishing touches. In the meantime, IRI's [Institute 
for Industrial Reconstruction] financial institution has 
announced respectable results for 1993: net profits were over 
1.4 trillion lire, with almost 30 trillion lire in combined 
revenues. All the while Finsiel, STET's leading company, is 
reorganizing: from now on it will consist of a department for 
directing operations and five "business units." 
  "Innovation no longer exists in Italian data processing, 
where the time for young entrepreneurs, capable of launching 
daring challenges to pre-existing operators, has passed," the 
PDS document says. The document is a total of 24 pages plus 11 
pages of tables. This is why it is necessary to create a 
conglomerate that will directly involve Tecnitel's STET, 
Finsiel, and Olivetti. It is in fact impossible to overcome 
the crisis "without the direct involvement of STET, with its 
manufacturing department of telecommunications equipment and 
network services, and with its data processing services 
department (Finsiel), and Olivetti and its manufacturing and 
services department." 
  According to [Achille] Occhetto's [PDS secrtary] party, this 
conglomerate will be in a position to gather together all the 
small and medium-sized enterprises of the sector, and thanks to 
oportune alliances with European partners, will be able to face 
the big competitors. 
  The PDS's plan is a radical one, behind which lies an 
unclear 
diagnosis of the Italian and international data processing 
sectors. The Italian data processing sector is made up of 
companies with a "scarce capacity to understand the situation," 
says the PDS, and where a "strong trend towards daily 
production, without long-term goals, exists." They are 
companies that "did not know how to take advantage of 
opportunities presented by financed research projects." In the 
research field, the efforts of Italian companies "are not only 
less than those of companies in other countries, but above all, 
they are not focused on national advantages and involve research 
of little use and scarce productivity." What's more, 
"investments abroad tend to be ignored." 
  But the document does not limit itself to drawing a global 
picture of the sector, it closely examines the situation of 
individual companies, all of which are not very comforting. 
Olivetti? "It cannot make it alone." IBM? "It's beginning to 
gasp." As for Bull, "it is too dependent on the lobby system 
and public administration." According to the PDS, if Olivetti 
is incapable of overcoming the present "difficult phase," a 
problem will be created not just for the Ivrea conglomerate, 
"but the entire Italian data processing field will ready to 
collapse." The Finsiel group position appears to be better off. 
"It is moving in an opposite direction from the rest of the 
sector which is encountering great difficulty in even 
maintaining its position." 
  Nevertheless, the "progressive" experts do not hide the 
difficulties inherent in the project. The document states that 
this conglomerate "is not easy to manage." That is why its 
strategic management "must be given to a group of managers that 
have not been compromised by the errors of the industrial and 
old power systems." It requires a management with strong 
technical expertise, capable of exercising a cultural leadership 
with high professional integrity. 
  Is the PDS "planning" the future of Italian data processing? 
In the meantime, STET is grinding out profits. Yesterday in 
Athens, where he was present at the inauguration of the 
Athens-Salonica highway mobile radio network, Michele Tedeschi, 
the number-two man at STET, reported its net profits for 1993 
were over 1.4 trillion lire, more or less in line with those of 
1992. Consolidated revenues were almost 3O trillion lire; an 
increase of more than 1O percent.

<F P=106> [Dominique Garraud Report: "Defense: A White Paper </F>
Controlled by Mitterrand"] 
  [Text] The government's defense white paper for the years 
2010-2015 is coming up the home straight. Today, Francois 
Mitterrand will convene his second and last defense council 
which will include his prime minister, the foreign, defense and 
economy ministers, and France's main military leaders. At the 
same time, it was announced yesterday in the Official Journal 
that Edouard Balladur and Francois Leotard will on 23 February 
be presenting the document to the National Assembly defense 
committee and the Senate's foreign affairs committee, which have 
been specially convened for the event. This announcement 
appears to indicate that the white paper will suffer no setbacks 
due to cohabitation. 
  A demonstration of a consensus "a la francaise" on defense, 
this agreement is however the result of a compromise imposed by 
the president, especially on the central issue of the nuclear 
deterrent force. RPR [Rally for the Republic] deputy Jacques 
Baumel, the vice president of the National Assembly's defense 
committee, said that the white paper would be "the bastard child 
of cohabitation," and the facts would seem to support his 
statement. After being voluntarily excluded from the process of 
studying and drawing-up the paper which was assigned to some 100 
experts in military affairs, Francois Mitterrand carefully 
waited for the moment to make his mark. The general secretary 
of the Elysee, Hubert Vedrine, indirectly participated in the 
development of the document, keeping in close contact with 
Nicolas Bazire, Edouard Balladur's principle private secretary. 
The head of state had already met with the defense council on 8 
December to discuss the white paper. 
  Francois Mitterrand underlined this role of "guardian of the 
doctrine" firstly by banning the resumption of nuclear testing 
before the end of his presidential mandate, flying in the face 
of all political and military advice from the parliamentary 
majority. He then again stressed the role just before the NATO 
summit at the start of January in Brussels. In an interview 
with AFP on 9 January, the head of state reaffirmed not only his 
"hostility" to resuming nuclear testing but also described the 
future tools of the French nuclear deterrent force: "In 1992 I 
decided to provide our next-generation submarines with a new 
missile (...) in the knowledge that this missile could also be 
installed on the Albion platform." 
  In short, this concerns the continued and accelerated 
development of the M5 ballistic missile intended to succeed the 
M45 by the year 2000 on submarines, and to develop a land-based 
version, the MS5 to replace the current S3D's on the Albion 
platform. This option has once again been pulled apart by a 
number of military chiefs and certain members of the 
parliamentary majority who would rather quite simply shut Albion 
down and modernize and develop the airborne force currently 
equipped with mid-range missiles (ASMP). 
  Moreover, it is no coincidence the Francois Mitterrand 
omitted to mention the airborne force in his interview. For 
months now, he has been careful to avoid the so-called French 
"weak to strong" doctrine (at one time opposing the tens of 
thousands of Soviet warheads) from becoming a "strong to weak or 
mad" deterrent which implies the modernization of the French 
arsenal with miniature and "decapitating" charges that could be 
carried by combat aircraft. 
  With the backing of Edouard Balladur, who, it seems, is 
little inclined to follow the (essentially RPR) promoters of 
doctrinal change, the white paper should remain faithful to the 
initial doctrine, including the delivery of an "ultimate 
deterrent force." However, it will also stress the French desire 
to conclude a total nuclear test ban treaty. As for components 
of the nuclear force (air, sea, and submarine), it should 
advocate their reduction to two from three, although without 
specifying the one that would remain alongside the nuclear 
missile-launching submarines.... 
  These details will have to be provided in the military 
planning law for 1995-2000 which should be put before parliament 
next June. This plan must decide on the finances that will be 
earmarked over five years for the development of new weapons. 
No doubt that Francois Mitterrand will ensure that the M5 
program is not sacrificed. 
  The planning law will take its lead from the white paper, 
which describes the restructuring of the defense tool according 
to the evolution of the strategic situation. There are six 
possible scenarios: from a major crisis (that could require a 
nuclear response) to a crisis of sovereignty (in the French 
overseas departments and territories), and including regional 
crises. From this it should be possible to deduce the formats 
of the forces capable of intervening (quickly and far) and of 
managing several crises at once. These directions will ensure a 
certain autonomy for the conventional forces which, until now, 
have been completely separate from the nuclear deterrent option 
in the framework of an East-West conflict. The philosophy 
behind the white paper is therefore to be found in Francois 
Leotard's constantly repeated statement that he does not want to 
see France "lowering her guard." 
  The problem is how to finance these ambitions. Here, the 
outlook is gloomy, given the requirements of Edouard Balladur's 
five year law on public spending control. A little while ago, 
the chiefs of staff were mentioning 5 percent as a figure for 
the annual volume increase in military arms expenditure between 
1995 and 2000. According to the national arms delegation, a 
"scant 3 percent" is needed to maintain the programs already 
launched (the Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft 
carrier, the Leclerc tank, the Tigre/Gerfaut and NH90 
helicopters, next-generation submarines, and ballistic missiles) 
for which the global cost would be around 574 billion French 
francs. The defense ministry has, for its part, envisaged 
scenarios based on 5 percent, 3 percent and 1 percent rises, and 
rises of even less that 1 percent. Francois Leotard today says 
that he "cannot do" with a rise of less than 1.5 percent. 
  That is the paradox: However smooth cohabitation was on the 
drafting of the white paper, a nice intergovernmental and 
intramajority dispute on the military planning law is to be 
expected.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 16 (AFP) -- The families of diplomats and 
staff at the French embassy in Belgrade are to be repatriated, 
the foreign ministry said Wednesday [16 February], amid 
increasing concern over possible NATO air strikes in 
neighbouring Bosnia. 
  Japanese and Dutch sources in Belgrade also said Wednesday 
that the two countries were considering evacuations. 
  The move follows similar steps already taken by the British, 
U.S. and Dutch embassies there ahead of the Sunday midnight GMT 
deadline for possible air strikes against Bosnian Serbs 
surrounding Sarajevo. 
  In Paris, foreign ministry spokeswoman Catherine Colonna 
said: "The decision was taken to evacuate families of state 
employees in Belgrade.... The French embassy in Belgrade has 
also urged the whole French community in the city to take care 
in current circumstances." 
  Officials here said the evacuation is to take place over the 
next two or three days, and will affect about 40 people of the 
107-strong French contingent of diplomats, embassy staff and 
families. 
  Meanwhile Western diplomats in Belgrade said Brussels had 
"strongly recommended" that families of diplomats and staff 
leave before Friday -- two days ahead of the NATO deadline. 
  "We are not particularly worried, but the Belgian government 
is of the view that our security in Belgrade cannot be 
guaranteed in the coming days," said a Belgian diplomat, asking 
not to be named. 
  A Japanese embassy spokesman, who also requested anonymity, 
said: "We are examining a number of solutions concerning the 
families, although evacuating diplomats at the moment is out of 
the question." 
  He gave no figure for the number of people who could be 
involved, or a date. "Perhaps even next week, after the 
ultimatum expires if there have been NATO strikes in Bosnia," he 
added. 
  So far a total of 40 family members have been evacuated from 
the other three diplomatic missions -- U.S., Dutch and British 
-- already sending their families out of the country. 
  Other Western diplomats here are still playing down the 
consequences of air strikes on the lives of expatriates. "There 
is no reason to leave at the moment," one senior Western 
diplomat told AFP. 
  "Evacuating now would seem more like putting psychological 
pressure on the Serbs than taking security measures," he said.

  [Text] Ajaccio, Corsica, Feb 17 (AFP) -- The banned 
Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) announced early 
Thursday [17 February] that it was resuming its military 
activities after an eight-month truce. 
  At a clandestine press conference held at a remote spot in 
southern Corsica, an FLNC spokesman flanked by about 100 
heavily-armed and hooded militants, announced the end of the 
truce declared on June 22 last year. 
  Most of the FLNC leadership was present, seated at a table 
beneath a banner reading "FLNC: The people has risen up. It 
must go forward." 
  The Corsican nationalist movement said its decision to 
resume 
its military activities "reflects our determination not to be 
fobbed off with dud promises or satisfied with a few concessions 
involving institutional gadgets or a heap of cash." 
  The FLNC said a visit by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on 
February 1 had "dissipated any ambiguity" about government 
policy. It said government policy in Corsica was "stamped with 
the seal of colonialism." 
  In view of the government's "intransigence" the FLNC said 
"we 
will resume our fight at all levels."

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy and Finance Minister Edmond </F>
Alphandery by Marie-Laure Cittanova, Francoise Crouigneau, and 
Jean de Belot; place and date not given] 
  [Text] While the government has just successfully carried 
out the biggest privatization ever in France with Elf [oil 
company], Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery welcomes the 
success of selling shares to the public. Especially because the 
privatizations make it possible, he thinks, to mobilize the 
means of combating unemployment, which demonstrates the 
coherence between the government's financial policy and social 
policy. In this interview to LES ECHOS, he states that the 
privatizations are not inconsistent with the incentives to 
consumption recently decided by the government: There is, the 
economy minister explains, a reserve of liquid savings 
accumulated in the short-term SICAV [open-end investment 
companies], which can either be invested in the long term, 
especially in shares in privatized companies, or be directed 
toward consumption. 
  At all events, the minister thinks that there is no reason 
at 
present to change his diagnosis of growth for 1994, in view of a 
series of reports showing that the climate is changing. 
Finally, he explained his thinking on the two plans which the 
economy ministry is due to implement in the spring: the reform 
of the Deposit and Consignment Bank, the unity of which he 
wishes to maintain, and the creation of pension funds. 
  [LES ECHOS] The government has recently reported favorable 
economic indicators. They still seem firm. Do you still think 
that growth will reach, or even exceed, 1.4 percent this year? 
  [Alphandery] We have no reason to change our diagnosis for 
1994. In addition, 1.4 percent or even 1.5 percent growth is 
not a high figure. I understand that, in the present climate, 
in which we are experiencing high unemployment, the signs of 
recovery give rise to a degree of skepticism. The same thing 
has been seen in the United States: The transition involves ups 
and downs. 
  However, since the beginning of the year, we have seen a 
series of reports which all go in the same direction. The 
climate is changing. In the enterprises, the prospects are 
improving, and this is clear in the sector of intermediate 
goods. Salaried work fell less in the second quarter, the drop 
was limited to 0.5 percent. With regard to household demand, 
consumption is still irregular, which justifies the measures 
taken to help the automobile industry. With regard to housing, 
demand is finally recovering. 
  [LES ECHOS] However, is there not a risk of seeing Germany, 
our main client, emerging more slowly from the recession than 
expected? 
  [Alphandery] Three things can be observed abroad. 
  In the United States, the small increase in the minimum 
lending rate was decided for internal purposes and only 
demonstrates one thing: The economy is working well and the 
only risk is that of overheating. In Japan, the new plan for 
recovery through lowering taxes is fairly important and should 
produce results. The recovery in Britain is being confirmed. 
In all, the international environment will be more buoyant in 
1994. The development in Germany is less predictable, although 
many signs suggest that the climate is improving. However, our 
scenario is cautious because we predict growth of only 0.5 
percent for western Germany this year. 
  [LES ECHOS] But is it not just exports which will lead 
French 
growth in 1994? 
  [Alphandery] The foreign order books are doing better and 
better. There is no doubt that, in our 1994 forecasts, exports 
are at the heart of the recovery. But the second buoyant 
element is investment by enterprises. Investments fell so much 
in 1993 that their stabilization at the present level in 1994 
will contribute to speeding up growth. 
  [LES ECHOS] Will the fall in investment over the past three 
years not mean that French industry will be lagging behind? 
  [Alphandery] This is a possibility which cannot be ruled 
out. 
We have lost a good deal of ground. This reflects the 
unsuitability of the economic policies pursued since the early 
eighties. If the level of unemployment in France is so high, it 
is because, structurally, our level of investment and our level 
of savings are too low. Our production sector is not strong 
enough given the growing burdens it bears. 
  [LES ECHOS] Is there not a contradiction between the 
inadequate savings which you deplore and the measures to revive 
consumption which the government has just taken? 
  [Alphandery] We need long-term savings to fund the 
investment 
necessary for a lasting economic development, as we need the 
situation to be supported by consumption. These two 
requirements are not inconsistent. Thus, the government, by 
various measures, is seeking the reduction of the treasury SICAV 
(around 600 billion francs [Fr] held by households). These 
savings, which only partly deserve that name, can be transformed 
very largely into long-term savings (PEA [shareholding savings 
plan], life insurance, property...) and into greater 
consumption. I am already observing appreciable results because 
the withdrawals of investments at the end of the year were large 
and effectively benefited shares and bonds, and helped support 
the consumption of households. 
  [LES ECHOS] How do you think short-term rates will develop 
in 
the coming months? 
  [Alphandery] For 10 months we have observed an overall 
reduction in the interest rate curve which was particularly 
large with regard to short-term rates. With regard to the 
future, I think that they could be below the long-term rates in 
1994. 
  [LES ECHOS] Assuming there is no exchange constraint, would 
it not be possible to speed up the reduction in short-term 
interest rates? 
  [Alphandery] If you look at what is happening in the 
European 
countries which are reputed to have freed themselves from any 
exchange constraints, you note that the long-term interest rates 
in those countries are higher than in France. On the other 
hand, a degree of stability in the currency seems more capable 
of guaranteeing a low level of interest rates, as the 
Netherlands shows, for instance. Hence the importance of 
pursuing a stable franc policy. 
  [LES ECHOS] Now that we are experiencing a period of calm 
for European currencies, would it not be possible to imagine a 
concerted cut in interest rates which all the European countries 
need? 
  [Alphandery] In this connection, I would like to stress that 
economic and financial cooperation exists. France and Germany, 
by jointly presenting coherent convergence programs, made it 
possible to draw up medium-term policies. With regard to 
interest rates, I note that the European countries have 
experienced a marked reduction in the level of these rates for a 
year, both in short and medium-term rates. With regard to the 
future, I think that the return to a normal scale of interest 
rates will also take place in the rest of Europe. 
  It is partly thanks to this fall in interest rates that the 
economic climate in France is changing. This fall has, in 
particular, boosted the Stock Exchange and is making the 
successful completion of privatization easier. 
  [LES ECHOS] In this connection, are you satisfied with the 
privatization of Elf? 
  [Alphandery] It is a great popular success. Some 3.1 million 
French people subscribed to it. The total which they requested 
(Fr38 billion) is considerable: It is the biggest demand ever 
recorded from individuals during a privatization in France. The 
privatizations are now well rooted in country. They have 
received a plebiscite from the French people. With this 
operation alone, we will have colleced Fr76 billion in less than 
six months: Fr43 billion in 1993 and Fr33 billion with the Elf 
privatization alone. This year, we should collect at least the 
Fr55 billion expected. 
  [LES ECHOS] How was this revenue allocated in 1993? 
  [Alphandery] The distribution was set out by the finance 
bill 
last spring: Fr18.7 billion were allocated to employment 
measures. Fr8 billion to support for economic activity (BTP 
[Public Buildings and Works sector], urban policy) and Fr16 
billion to capital donations for public enterprises. It is 
clear that there is consistency between the government financial 
policy and social policy. The privatizations make it possible 
to mobilize resources for combating unemployment, for social 
progress, and for employment. In 1994, we are following the same 
policy. 
  [LES ECHOS] Raymond Barre criticized you for not following 
an 
orthodox policy because the money from privatizations should 
serve to clear the state's debts. 
  [Alphandery] That would be my dearest wish, because Raymond 
Barre is right. But necessity dictates: We inherited the worst 
recession since the war. To extricate ourselves from it, we had 
to make good the public and social deficits: We therefore took 
resources where they are to be found. We do not have any choice. 
  At all events, I note that the privatizations are a 
remarkable success in terms of popular shareholding and also 
with employees of the privatized enterprises. In addition, we 
have drawn up a privatization technique which is proven: The 
Privatization Commission gained a reputation for unswerving 
independence and responsibility in the first operations. I 
would like to pay tribute to it. 
  [LES ECHOS] In view of the prime minister's growing promises 
in recent weeks, are you not afraid of a loss of budget control 
which would make it impossible for France to meet the Maastricht 
criteria? 
  [Alphandery] Let us not make any mistake about scale. The 
emergency aid granted to the fishermen amounts to Fr300 million, 
spending to improve safety in schools amounts to Fr500 million 
per year over five years. Of course, these are large sums for 
those who will benefit from them, but, compared with the total 
budget deficit, this is insignificant. 
  Moreover, there is nothing abnormal about this, because 
every 
year unexpected spending has to be included in the budget. The 
essential thing is to counterbalance this unexpected spending by 
savings. In 1993, when the government took office, it launched 
a large sum of new spending while reducing the budget deficit. 
These two things are not incompatible. The policy which we are 
following does not take us away from the Maastricht criteria, 
but brings us closer to it. I would remind you that we have 
already reduced the budget deficit by Fr20 billion and the 
Social Security deficit by Fr70 billion. This is a considerable 
initial effort. 
  This ability to hold the general course of our policy while 
adapting was again welcomed last week by two big British 
weeklies known for their critical judgment. 
  [LES ECHOS] What are your plans for the Deposit and 
Consignment Bank? 
  [Alphandery] I would first like to explain that there is no 
question of causing an unpheaval in the existing Deposit Bank. 
Thus, the reform will safeguard the establishment's unity. It 
will maintain the existing group, and will not lead to a breakup 
or dismantling of it. It will maintain the status of the staff 
and the staffing levels. 
  The aim of the reform is to modernize the Bank and to submit 
its competitive activities to rules equivalent to those of its 
competitors. For instance, the 1816 statute makes provision for 
the Bank's director general to be indefinitely fixed in his 
post, which the governor of the Bank of France is not. Another 
example: The Bank is not subject to the same controls as other 
public enterprises and must clarify its relations with the 
state. One way of doing this is giving some banking and 
financial activities to subsidiaries. A clarification of the 
Bank's missions and functioning is therefore necessary. 
  [LES ECHOS] When will the plan be ready? 
  [Alphandery] At the end of March. It should be adopted by 
the government to be examined by Parliament in the spring 
session. 
  [LES ECHOS] Do you not think that the approach of the 
presidential election will hamper any intention of reform? 
  [Alphandery] No, of course not, other issues, of varying 
importance, are being prepared. I would like to mention in 
particular the issue of pension funds. In this sphere, I think 
that the technical dimension is less difficult to handle than 
the psychological and political dimensions. Thinking is 
changing. However, some people still have reservations. 
Consultation has started to detect the concerns of the 
interested parties and make it possible to define a pension fund 
system by capitalization which the French people want, as the 
success of life insurance has demonstrated.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 16 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur suffered a new fall in his popularity in an opinion 
poll to be published Thursday [17 February], but he was still at 
record levels after more than 10 months in power. 
  Balladur dropped five points to 55 percent in a poll by the 
BVA institute carried out for the weekly Paris-Match while those 
dissatisfied with him increased by seven points to 36 percent. 
  Two polls published a week ago showed a similar trend, with 
Gallup registering a seven percent drop to 52 percent and CSA a 
six-point drop to 56 percent as Balladur, an undeclared 
candidate in 1995 presidential elections, battled with sometimes 
violent protest movements. 
  Since last October, the prime minister has given way to the 
protesters, capitulating first to Air France strikers by 
withdrawing a draconian restructuring plan for the loss-making 
airline. 
  In January, a massive demonstration by more than 600,000 
teachers and students against a reform plan forced its 
abandonment and last month, the government gave way to violent 
protests by French fishermen protesting cheap imports. 
  The BVA poll said 62 percent would support a broad protest 
movement of demonstrations or a general strike, compared with 56 
percent a month ago, in face of Balladur's attempts to reduce 
unemployment and fight recession, criticised by some sections of 
his own right-wing coalition as too timid. 
  The BVA poll also said there was an increase of two points 
to 
74 percent of people thinking there was a risk of an upheaval 
comparable to the student uprising and general strike of May 
1968. 
  The poll also said 21 percent, compared with 17 percent, 
would take an active part in such an upheaval, while another 41 
percent would support it, compared with 39 percent a month ago. 
  Six percent, a one point drop, would oppose it and 25 
percent 
(unchanged) would remain neutral.

<F P=106> [Interview with Communist Party Secretary-Elect Robert Hue </F>
by Gianni Marsilli in Paris; date not given: "`Yes, I Shall Make 
Changes, Like Marchais'"] 
  [Text] Robert Hue, newly elected to the head of the PCF 
[French Communist Party], in his office in the immense glass and 
cement Colonel Fabien Building, the party executive's 
headquarters. In this interview -- "the first with a foreign 
paper, I am greatly looking forward to it" -- he gives a preview 
of the approach that he intends to take: in the footsteps of 
Marchais, whom he considers a man of change; against the Europe 
of Maastricht; cautious and unbending toward the PS [Socialist 
Party], and caustic on the subject of the left-wing "big bang" 
so dear to Rocard. 
  [Marsilli] Robert Hue, do you believe that Marchais' 
membership of the party executive is compatible with your plans 
for change? How can you avoid being considered a "sponsored" 
secretary? 
  [Hue] Let us make one thing clear: The initiative was mine. 
Marchais was against it, and I had to put a lot of pressure on 
him. 
  [Marsilli] Why did you do it? 
  [Hue] First of all because we cannot do without the 
contribution of a man like Marchais. Where top-ranking leaders 
are concerned, moreover, I see similar things happening in other 
parties, though they do not give rise to the same comments. As 
for me, I have my own personality as an individual and as a 
politician. Believe me, I am not under anybody's wing. 
  [Marsilli] Will you opt for continuity or change? 
  [Hue] I want to implement the policies that the communists 
want and have decided on, those that emerged from our last 
conference. If we want to give it a name, we may call it "change 
within continuity." This party is evolving like a multistage 
rocket. The first stage was launched in the seventies and 
eighties, when we broke with the Soviet model.... 
  [Marsilli] Broke? 
  [Hue] Yes. Wait a moment, let me finish what I was saying. 
The second stage was launched at the 28th conference: renewal 
that spreads and broadens as the communists continue the debate, 
in a process taking us from a communist tradition bound up with 
one model to a different analysis, another conception of the 
party in which there is no place for false unanimity or 
uniformity. Above all, there are a lot of people in this 
country who deeply resent the policies of the Right now in power 
and who are asking themselves just where society, dominated by 
King Mammon, is going. We do not intend to propose that the 
French people should do what has failed elsewhere. We do not 
intend to repeat tomorrow what failed in France in the eighties. 
  [Marsilli] Do you regret the departure of Charles Fiterman 
(leader of the reformists)? 
  [Hue] I respect his decision to resign his executive 
responsibilities, but it saddens me. However, I hope to work 
with him again and with those comrades within the party who 
wholly or partly share his convictions. Moreover, I have 
publicly expressed my displeasure at the instances of ostracism 
that have occurred in the past: Party unity has nothing to do 
with party uniformity. Indeed, the present executive comprises 
comrades with different views. 
  [Marsilli] Allow me to run briefly over the party's history. 
1956: We have to wait until the seventies before the French 
communists are officially informed of the Khrushev report. 
1968: The PCF dissociates itself from the Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia but does not break off relations with the 
Soviet-controlled puppet government, quite the contrary. 1979: 
Marchais gives his blessing to the invasion of Afghanistan. 
The eighties: The PCF mistrusts Gorbachev and perestroyka. 
Never an in-depth consideration of the relationship between 
democracy and socialism. Will there be one with you? 
  [Hue] You say "never." Allow me to say that I find this 
unfair. It is true, as far as 1956 is concerned, we reacted 
late, very late, and this damaged us. I would add that in the 
sixties, when the time came to provide a fresh answer to the 
questions confronting French society following the establishment 
of the institutions of the Fifth Republic, we were unable to 
propose anything more than a remake of the People's Front. Not 
enough. With regard to 1968, our condemnation of the Soviet 
intervention was unequivocal, despite the fact that we did not 
break with the "model." But from the early seventies things 
have changed with Marchais. 
  [Marsilli] Oh yes, such as? 
  [Hue] We have worked out a self-managing socialism for 
France, we have abandoned the dictatorship of the proletariat 
for democracy. We now say that the great contemporary issues 
center on the need for democracy. It is this need that 
capitalism suffocates, barring the path to progress of any kind: 
This path lies in fostering the individual's capacity for 
initiative. 
  [Marsilli] Could you imagine abandoning the term 
"communist"? 
  [Hue] It is up to each party, and I respect the decisions of 
each one. As far as I am concerned, I believe that the 
discredit deriving from a whole historical experience cannot be 
miraculously shaken off merely by abandoning a word, especially 
as we lay claim to our name as communists for reasons quite 
different from events in the East. The term has existed in 
France since 1789. In our eyes, it expresses, in spite of 
everything, the finest struggle, the struggle for human 
liberation.... The mentality that constituted our reference 
model in the past has failed once and for all, and we reject it 
to build something else. But what we are fighting for is a real 
change in society that owes nothing to capitalism, a communist 
society. 
  [Marsilli] What do you think of the "big bang" that Rocard 
was talking about a year ago, and about the recent negotiations 
on the Left? 
  [Hue] I saw "big bang" as exemplifying a frenetic search for 
a new slogan, which the socialist defeat reduced to more 
realistic proportions a few weeks later. That idea of Rocard's 
set out to realign the French political scene toward the center, 
excluding us. It was suicide for the Left: You cannot build 
anything on division. I should welcome a more realistic approach 
on the part of the PS today. 
  [Marsilli] The PS is now much weaker. Do you intend to take 
advantage of this? 
  [Hue] I have no ambition to strengthen the PCF to the 
detriment of the others, but I know that millions of people are 
profoundly disappointed, that the left wing of the population is 
out there, waiting. And so I want the PCF to be a force that 
advances proposals, that attracts support. To this extent, the 
answer is yes, but I do not intend to invert the claim that the 
PS used to make: We shall take 3 million votes from the PCF.... 
  [Marsilli] How do you see relations on the Left? 
  [Hue] I hope that the Left, and the PS in particular, which 
has exercised governing power, will look itself hard in the 
face. We have done so, but the socialists have not. I also 
want the progressive forces, left-wing people, all those who 
will not be seduced by the Right, to unite. We must join 
forces, not in a logic of alternation, mere electoral majority, 
but as a deep-rooted political alternative. 
  [Marsilli] What do you expect from the Socialist Party? 
  [Hue] That it should talk in concrete terms. That it should 
reflect on its error in presenting Maastricht as an opportunity 
for France. That it should seriously weigh up its experience in 
government. This is what I hope; I do not want to be 
quarrelsome or aggressive. What I ask for is not displays of 
public breast-beating, but serious thought. 
  [Marsilli] To which political movement in Europe do you 
currently feel closest? 
  [Hue] The distinguishing mark of the progressive movement in 
Europe nowadays is its diversity.... All these forces are 
confronting the problems involved in constituting an alternative 
to the neoliberal austerity policies in different conditions. 
We are working to foster all potential convergences, without 
prejudices. The problems are the same, the labels are of 
secondary importance. 
  [Marsilli] What is the motto that you will be taking into 
the 
European elections? 
  [Hue] The line of demarcation is not drawn nowadays between 
pro-Europeans and anti-Europeans, but between those with a 
progressive concept of Europe and the neomarketeers. We are in 
favor of building a Europe united in the service of work and 
social progress, a democratic Europe that shifts the 
decisionmaking centers toward the people and enhances the 
sovereignty of nations and peoples, incorporating present-day 
needs for cooperation. We are in favor of a demilitarized 
Europe.... 
  [Marsilli] Should we look eternally to the United States to 
solve our defense and security problems? 
  [Hue] No, we need an autonomous Europe. We are in favor of 
demilitarization. We have to continue along the road toward 
disarmament. We think that European security should be founded 
on a political basis of cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by Viola Herms Drath "Clinton Seeking Answers"] </F>
  [Text] Of course, President Clinton knew when he decided 
to intervene in the Bosnian conflict after a long period of 
hesitation: The political climate in the United States does not 
really allow the use of U.S. troops. Nevertheless, his support 
for the UN/NATO ultimatum based on a French initiative came 
fairly quickly. 
  People are still asking what the reasons for this decision 
were. Was it increasing pressure from the Islamic states, 
Egypt's cooperation with Paris, the rapidly progressing economic 
destabilization of Bosnia's neighbors? Or was it the fact that 
the leadership of the last superpower was being questioned? 
There are a number of open questions. 
  Alarmed at the expansionary tendencies of Russia, which is 
obligated to the Serbs, the East European states increasingly 
are concerned by the negative effects the continuing civil war 
has on the economy. Beside the cutting off of regional trade 
relations and the drying up of investments, Washington is 
becoming concerned about a threatening loss of confidence. Word 
has got round that a passive and leaderless West will also be 
asked to pay up. 
  For the first time, the White House, after advocating 
lifting 
Bosnian weapons embargo in vain, is actively trying to achieve a 
political solution. Against this background, Clinton encouraged 
the Bosnian Muslims to accept certain modifications in the 
Geneva peace talks. Now it will be the U.S. emissary's special 
task to examine the demands of the besieged. 
  In the meantime, Washington knows that it is absolutely 
necessary to establish a balance of power in former Yugoslavia. 
The U.S. Congress has been assured by the Clinton 
administration that cooperation with the French and a 
demonstration of solidarity within NATO are the best way to 
solve the Bosnian dilemma. The argument that no U.S. interests 
are endangered in Sarajevo is rapidly weakened by the horror 
scenes shown on the world's television screens every day. 
  Even if, due to the difficulties on the ground, the Pentagon 
remains skeptical about the French military plans, the White 
House acknowledges that in terms of U.S. foreign policy the 
conflict has long since extended beyond its regional aspect. In 
order to avoid political escalation following a military one, 
Clinton is keeping to his dual strategy of political compromise 
and military pressure. The fact that this change in policy 
makes it increasingly difficult for the United States to 
maintain the necessary neutrality makes a success of the 
ultimatum all the more urgently required.

  [Text] Saarbruecken (DDP/ADN) -- The Russian ambassador to 
Germany has again warned NATO of the consequences of air strikes 
in Bosnia. The use of force will "not solve any problems but 
will produce bigger ones," Ambassador [Vladimir] Terechov said 
on Saarlaendischer Radio today. Discussion in the West has 
concentrated "much too heavily" on the use of military means, 
the diplomat said. There was no better way to peace than 
through negotiations. 
  Terechov said the Russian Government is optimistic that a 
demilitarization of Sarajevo could be achieved "very soon" with 
"the good will" of the conflicting parties. His country is in 
constant touch with Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia. "I believe 
Russia is doing good work," the ambassador stressed.

  [Text] Bonn, 15 February -- The Federal Prosecution 
Service is conducting investigations of 10 more Serbs suspected 
of participating in genocide in the war zones of what was 
formerly Yugoslavia. Bonn announced this Tuesday [15 February] 
after an investigating magistrate of the Federal Court applied 
for an arrest warrant for a Serb living in Munich suspected of 
complicity in genocide, murder, and serious assault. This is 
the first time that the "international principle" of the 
criminal code has been employed. Human rights organizations 
have reported for some time that a considerable number of 
"suspected torturers" at Serbian concentration camps were 
residing in Germany. Law enforcement agencies have indications 
of links between Serbian criminal organizations in Germany and 
perpetrators of human rights violations in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "Washington's Guns Are Pointing at </F>
Tokyo"] 
  [Text] The oldest Japanese argument against the frustrated 
Americans goes along the following lines: "Our people do not 
want to buy what you produce. We are not blocking our market, 
but you are not good enough to crack it." Earlier this week, 
however, these familiar words lost some of their persuasiveness, 
and the reason is called "Motorola." 
  This company is the world leader in mobile telephones; 
Motorola phones are beeping from Andorra to Cyprus. For exactly 
10 years now, the U.S. company has been trying to gain a 
foothold in the Japanese market, but it has only managed to get 
a 4-percent share of the market so far -- in spite of three 
solemn agreements in 1987, 1989, and 1992. Special Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor says it is "wrong and dishonest" to 
maintain that Motorola does not have anything decent to offer or 
does not make an effort. 
  Incidentally, Kantor's appearance (mobile phone in hand) 
took 
place in the wake of a much more serious rift between the two 
allies. Over the weekend, Prime Minister Hosokawa himself had 
come to Washington to find a way out of the looming trade war, 
together with Bill Clinton. The Prime Minister came, saw -- and 
did not conquer. For the first time, the Americans seem prepared 
to use the guns. Clinton "does not want to rule out anything," 
and Kantor only wants to grant a 30-day grace period. Unless an 
agreement is achieved, Washington might retaliate -- with 
countervailing duties of up to 100 percent. 
  Of course, the issue is not just telephones, but a 
persistent 
$50 billion trade deficit. Washington wants to punish Japan's 
sin against free trade by a sin of its own. Tired of the 
endless debates on opening markets, the United States does not 
want to lay down rules, but results: a certain number of market 
shares for U.S. products by a certain date. The euphemism is 
called managed trade; it is directed against the spirit and the 
laws of GATT, which disapproves of bilateral agreements and 
preaches universal trade regulations. On the other hand, 
Motorola shows that the problem is not visible trade barriers, 
but the way in which Japan's "market" is organized. Duties are 
low, but foreign exporters are caught in a network of official 
and unofficial cartels that bind local wholesalers and retailers 
to domestic producers, and thus prevent competition. Both 
Japanese consumers and European exporters would benefit from the 
United States breaking through this barrier. The only question 
is whether a society can be changed from outside. 
  Yet, the Americans are unlikely to give in again. For 
decades, Washington withdrew its guns, because geopolitics in 
the shadow of a powerful Soviet Union was more important than 
the balance of trade. But today the USSR no longer exists and 
the United States can choose among a number of partners in the 
Pacific Region. Hosokawa is not in an enviable position.

<F P=106> [Report signed "kum": "Referendum on Maastricht"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt, 14 February -- The Presidium of the 
Association of Free Citizens considers the 12 June European 
elections to be a "German referendum on the Maastricht Treaty 
and the future of the German mark." In a petition dealing with 
policy on Europe issued by the party, which was founded recently 
by former FDP [Free Democratic Party] politician Brunner, the 
Presidium warns of the consequences of the Maastricht Treaty. 
"Maastricht, a product of secret cabinet politics, will fail, 
because the Germans will not allow themselves to be deprived of 
the German mark, because Europe's cultural diversity will not 
tolerate a super state, and because liberal democracy inevitably 
will be destroyed along with the nation." Europe cannot be 
forced into being a community, but should be organized as "an 
association of sovereign states." The petition further states 
that the Maastricht Treaty will result in central planning 
overcoming a market economy in Europe, and a bureaucratic 
"redistribution apparatus," largely financed by Germany, which 
will come into being and ruin the German economy. To check this 
"regulation madness" and "the power of bureaucracy," all 
guidelines and directives that extend beyond the single market 
should be approved by the national parliaments. The document 
does not deal with the European Parliament in Strasbourg. 
  The presidium calls for the abolition of EU [European Union] 
agricultural subsidies, which are a described as a "corrupt 
farce." One quarter of agricultural subsidies end up in 
"dishonest hands." The destruction of food on a massive scale 
must end. The party opposes the "imposition of uniformity" by 
European laws and is in favor of minimum standards that will 
enable each country to "introduce tougher or the toughest 
possible criteria if it so wishes." 
  The petition expresses support for EU common foreign and 
security policies. "While the EU is smothered by bureaucracy 
and is in the process of dismantling liberal democracy, it is 
still unable to pursue a common foreign policy on really major 
issues." The EU was helpless and in disagreement in the face of 
the outbreak of war in the Balkans. A common foreign policy 
must be based on the right of peoples to self-determination. 
"If unanimity cannot be achieved on foreign policy issues, 
there should be an obligation to exchange information and 
maintain peace," the document states. However, a security 
policy that is independent of the United States and NATO runs 
counter to German interests. Finally, the party leadership 
proposes that the the states of Central Europe become EU members 
"as quickly as possible." Political stability and the economic 
development of the new democracies in East Europe are the 
central element in the Association of Free Citizens policy on 
Europe.

considers the underlying economic trend in Germany as being 
"generally upward," although economic developments varied in 
late 1993 and early 1994. At the same time the high 
unemployment rate remains the key economic problem, according to 
the ministry's economic report for February, published in Bonn 
today. 
  The rebuilding of the east German economy is continuing to 
make "clear progress," the report says. The private sector in 
eastern Germany is "increasingly gaining momentum." [passage 
omitted] 
  The rise in the level of registered unemployed to over 4 
million was "not surprising" and in line with the annual 
forecast. It was due largely to the usual effects of winter on 
the labor market, which would subside during the spring, the 
report predicts optimistically. In addition, the labor market 
is seen as a delayed indicator which "still shows the effects of 
last spring's economic setback in eastern Germany." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "ptz": "Rexrodt Admits Setback at the End of </F>
the Year"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The FRG Economics Ministry's current 
economic forecasting is more restrained than a few weeks ago. 
"Around the end of the year," economic indicators "did not show 
a unified picture; however, the basic trend seems to be upward," 
Rexrodt's ministry now notes. 
  The economists in Bonn are more worried about the situation 
in west German industry. "Orders received and production once 
again declined there during the fourth quarter, following an 
upswing that was observed during the third quarter." All in 
all, adjusted GDP, as a comprehensive expression of the overall 
economic performance, "may have declined a bit" during the last 
quarter of 1993. As a positive element, the ministry notes 
"improved" business expectations in the processing industry. 
  On 21 January, the ministry said: "The slow climb out of the 
deep valley of the recession had already begun in the old 
laender last year. During the second and third quarter, 
GDP...increased slightly and probably stayed at the achieved 
level also during the last quarter of 1993."

<F P=106> [Report signed "Jl": "German Exports Have Gained Ground </F>
Again"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 16 February -- As a result of the clear 
recovery of the global economy, the long stagnation in the 
German export sector has also come to an end. The Bundesbank 
writes this in its new monthly report. Because of the 
continuing weakness in investment and in private consumption, 
recessionary trends have not been overcome completely in western 
Germany, but, together with a strong recovery in construction at 
the end of last year, recovery in the export sector gives 
particular reason for confidence. Strong economic growth has 
continued in eastern Germany. Now economic expansion is no 
longer supported solely by the construction sector, but 
increasingly also by the manufacturing industry. 
  According to the Bundesbank, for the first time in more than 
a year, exports clearly increased in the last two months of 
1993. In October and November, exports exceeded those of the 
two previous months by 5 percent. As a result of the tangible 
recovery in export business, the trade balance surplus -- 16 
billion German marks -- was twice as high as in August and 
September. Foreign orders to the manufacturing industry 
continued to rise strongly during the last quarter of 1993; they 
were 8.5 percent higher in real terms than during the 
corresponding months of the previous year. Growth was 
particularly high in automobile industry and in machine building. 
  According to the Bundesbank, this was due partly to economic 
recovery in some European countries and in the United States. 
The competitiveness of German companies improved because, among 
other things, of the exchange rate against important European 
currencies and the U.S. dollar. In the Bundesbank's view, the 
German import demand had already reached its low point in the 
summer months of 1993. 
  Regarding domestic demand in western Germany, the 
still-existing weaknesses were concentrated on private 
consumption and investments. The increases in the income of 
private households are more than devoured by price hikes and 
higher rates and fees. The inclination toward investments is 
hurt by the lower company profits, the still- missing 
expectations for the future, and a continuing low capacity 
utilization. Even though the downward trend in production has 
been stopped, capacity utilization is still low because of the 
previous long decline while plans for company expansions are 
relegated to the back burner. In total, domestic orders in 
investment goods sector were 5 percent lower during the last 
quarter of 1993 than during the corresponding period the year 
before. The companies' gross fixed investments were about 10 
percent lower. 
  In eastern Germany, indicators have gained in dynamism, the 
Bundesbank thinks. This is due, above all, to a steady 
expansion of domestic demand, which indicates that industrial 
products have become increasingly competitive.

Their Jobs in Mines"] 
  [Text] Duisburg -- Although the decline in the Ruhr 
economy -- which is particularly severely affected by the coal 
and steel crises -- seems to have been stopped, more and more 
people in that region are losing their jobs. Surveying 1,700 
companies, the Chambers of Industry and Commerce in Bochum, 
Dortmund, Duisburg, Essen, and Muenster discovered that every 
second firm is thinking of reducing its staff this year. 
  In industry, two out of three companies want to cut jobs. In 
1993, more than 37,000 people in the Rhein and Ruhr areas lost 
their jobs; 13,000 of them had been employed in the mining 
industry. Since a large number of jobs have been destroyed by 
the escalating costs and structural changes, there will be no 
success stories from the labor market in the foreseeable future, 
the president of the Duisburg Chamber of Industry and Commerce, 
Hans Georg Willers, said. 
  In the Ruhr area, 155,000 jobs have been created in the 
service sector over the past 15 years -- yet the same number was 
lost in manufacturing industry.

<F P=106> [Report signed "mh": "Experts: Transrapid Financing </F>
Concept Is Unrealistic"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 9 February -- While Thyssen-Henschel 
boss Winfried Haastert reported positive reactions in the United 
States to Bonn's basic decision made in December in favor of a 
Transrapid line from Hamburg to Berlin, renowned transportation 
experts on Wednesday [9 February] published a devastating 
statement regarding the project's financing and the basic 
scientific data that were used. 
  The Scientific Advisory Council at the Transportation 
Ministry, which is staffed with renowned transportation experts 
from German universities, sees clear deficiencies and risks 
regarding financing. Forecasts of demand, estimates of 
revenues, and the calculation of investment and operating costs 
are all based on "ideal framework conditions." 
  The development figures used for eastern Germany and Berlin 
are target forecasts, the realization of which is rather 
unlikely in view of current trends. In no case may one 
establish a private financing concept for the Transraid train on 
political wishful thinking. Nevertheless, if this is done, 
there is the obvious assumption that the involved companies 
expect the possibility of higher state participation than 
stipulated in the financing concept. 
  In estimating revenues, maximum estimates were linked with 
maximum demand; however, previous expert reports have shown 
demand clearly declining with high fares. Since Deutsche Bahn 
AG is porjected as the operator, a consolidated assessment of 
profitability will also have to be made. However, the estimates 
of profitability were not done on the basis of the 
transportation network but on the basis of individual routes. 
  Regarding construction costs, the scientists note that the 
additional costs, which are to be expected in particular for a 
viable line in the Berlin region -- which is, quite certainly, 
to be built underground -- have not been taken into 
consideration. Installations for operational purposes appear to 
be underestimated. 
  The greatest reproach of the scientists: No alternatives 
have been checked; thus, a conventional high-speed line with 20 
additonal minutes travel time or inclining trains [Neigezuege] 
with 40 additional minutes of travel time compared with the 
Transrapid could also achieve a high transportation value with 
clearly lower investments. 
  The Scientific Advisory Council deliberately did not comment 
on the technology politicy aspects linked with the project and, 
thus, also not on the forthcoming maturity of the Transrapid for 
serial production, which had been cited by Haastert and which is 
accelerated by a current "optimization program" subsidized by 
the FRG Research Ministry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Left-Wing Violence on the Increase"] </F>
  [Text] Right-wing and left-wing extremists are moving 
closer together as far as violence is concerned. Preliminary 
1993 figures by the Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution indicate that there were some 1,100 acts of 
violence by left-wing extremists, while the other side accounted 
for 1,820 such incidents (in 1992: 980 and 2,638, involving one 
and 17 deaths, respectively). 
  Included among the acts of violence are murder and homicide, 
bomb and arson attacks, breach of the public peace, personal 
injury, traffic blockages, and severe damage to property. 
  Christian Democratic Union Bundestag Deputy Heinrich Lummer 
said that irrespective of the "convergence of extremism" 
reporting on leftist violence is neglected in most media: "All 
forms of extremist violence must be stigmatized." Left-wing 
extremism, the former Berlin senator for the interior said, is 
"overshadowed insofar as national exposure is concerned."

"special" correspondent Philippe Lamair; place and date not

  [Text] For the first time in several days, a civilian in 
Sarajevo was killed by a sniper today. There were no other 
infringements of the cease-fire, however. Neither was there any 
sign from the Serbs, who are maintaining their position, 
although NATO has made it clear that the ultimatum would not be 
extended beyond the Sunday [20 February] midnight deadline. Our 
special correspondent in former Yugoslavia, Philippe Lamair, met 
with Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs. 
  [Lamair] [Question not heard] 
  [Karadzic] If all that NATO is trying to do is make us 
withdraw our artillery without also controlling the Muslim 
infantry, then there will be a strategic imbalance and the war 
will continue. I believe the threats should stop and diplomacy 
should go forth. If the international community treats both 
sides on equal footing, then there will be a peace accord. If 
the sanctions against Serbia are lifted, for example, then the 
Muslims will sign a peace [agreement], not before. 
  [Lamair] [Question not heard] 
  [Karadzic] I believe that the United States wants to flex 
its 
muscles, humiliate Russia, and scare other countries. NATO is 
just like a young man who has lost his job; he is flexing his 
muscles, he is showing that he can hit anyone. It is obvious 
that they can hit us. We are only 4.5 million people, so they 
can hit us very easily. But it will be a moral disaster for the 
NATO countries. You will see, in the event there are air 
strikes, many NATO countries will distance themselves 
immediately from this immoral move.

<F P=106> [Michel Rosten commentary: "Bosnia: The Ultimatum Is </F>
Running Out...."] 
  [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin is in 
Sarajevo. He has just made a tour of the former Yugoslavia and 
thinks that this mission was "the most unfruitful" that he has 
made to the region. He blamed the Muslims who decided on 
Tuesday [15 February] to boycott the meeting between the 
commander in chief of the Serbian forces in Bosnia and the 
commander in chief of the government army, although this meeting 
was described as "crucial" by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. 
  This meeting was to make it possible to define the procedure 
for the withdrawal operations and the establishment of control 
over the heavy weapons, a process deadlocked on Monday by mutual 
distrust. The fact that Mr. Silajdzic said he knew nothing of 
this meeting to justify the absence of General Delic does not 
argue for the Bosnian prime minister's sense of responsibility, 
and it is not known what his motives might be. But can anything 
else be expected from somebody who had pledged -- even to 
President Clinton's special envoy to Sarajevo -- not to exploit 
the shelling truce to regain territory, although the UNPROFOR's 
observations on the ground proved the contrary. Mr. Silajdzic's 
attitude is lamentable; but that of the leader of the Serbian 
Forces, who has just stated that Serbian artillery will not pull 
back, is no less so. Nothing more is needed to prompt new 
tensions at a time when the NATO ultimatum is running out.... 
  In fact, there is nobody in diplomatic circles who wants the 
Atlantic alliance to carry out its threats. But everybody knows 
that NATO will not hesitate if the conditions it has put forward 
are not met. The situation being what it is, there is reason to 
fear that there are people in the two camps who do not fear air 
strikes at all, and who even imagine that they might serve their 
purpose. When you hear Mr. Karadzic stupidly counting on the 
collapse of the alliance if it launched air raids, you have to 
admit that the disaster met by Saddam Husayn -- who also 
believed that he could defy the international community with 
impunity -- has not served as a lesson. 
  All these signs suggest that reason is not triumphing this 
week. In this case, there is strong reason to think that the 
alliance will have to intervene and thus strike heavily -- with 
all the risks of collateral damage which this operation carries 
-- to secure the results it is seeking. That would not 
necessarily change the face of Europe....

<F P=106> [Interview with Rik Coolsaet, deputy chief of cabinet to </F>
Foreign Minister Claes, by Jorgen Oosterwaal; place and date not 
given: "The Eye of Moscow"--first two paragaphs are KNACK 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Rik Coolsaet is deputy chief 
of cabinet to Foreign Minister Willy Claes, of the Socialist 
Party [SP]. He has long been the SP's defense expert and was 
appointed recently lecturer in international relations at Ghent 
University. [passage omitted] 
  Coolsaet fully understands why the West is being cautious 
and 
why NATO, for the time being, is not offering East Europe more 
than the Partnership for Peace. A surprising view for a man who 
for more than a decade has been encouraging the Belgian 
Government to adopt a more active and daring Ostpolitik. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oosterwaal] East and West seem ready to tie the bond, but 
because Yeltsin is holding back, it seems we will first have to 
cohabit for a while yet? 
  [Coolsaet] Why should NATO be enlarged? Because we like the 
company of the East European countries? Because we share the 
same values and they belong with us? Or in order to ensure the 
stability of Central and East Europe? NATO is not a cultural 
organization, which means that only the latter reason is valid. 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott assumes that 
stability in Europe will de determined by developments in 
Russia. I believe he is right in his assumption. We must take 
full account of Moscow. We must know what the Russians are 
thinking. Why is Russia so against the enlargement of NATO? 
Because it sees it as a move toward a dangerous isolation. 
Since 1917 that has been a permanent fear for the Russians. We 
must not fuel this paranoia. 
  We can draw a parallel with the Ostpolitik of the former 
German Chancellor Willy Brandt. He could only begin his detente 
efforts after he had assured the Russians of the status quo in 
Europe, and thus by acknowledging Russia's place in Europe. 
Another example is the Cuban crisis. U.S. President John 
Kennedy was able to resolve it successfully because he did not 
start bombing immediately but tried instead to understand how 
Nikita Khruschev saw the conflict. 
  [Oosterwaal] The West hopes to keep Yeltsin in place because 
it is horrified by his rival, Zhirinovskiy. But the West has 
little or no influence on Russia's domestic affairs. 
  [Coolsaet] The best guarantee for stability in Europe is a 
democratic Russia. Whatever it takes, we must not allow an 
authoritarian, despotic system to develop in the former Soviet 
Union which would be opposed to the West. But how? By 
supporting the forces for democracy. I also know that our 
impact is very limited. But however limited this influence may 
be, we must at least try. If we believe that Russia is 
automatically embarking on a new imperialist adventure, then we 
cannot hesitate. Then we must enlarge the alliance as quickly 
as possible. But I do not believe that this scenario is 
unavoidable. 
  Russian society consists of a Slavic, nationalist component 
and a Western-oriented component. It has been that way since 
Peter the Great. It is one of the keys to an understanding of 
Russia. Zhirinovskiy is the crystallization of a frustrated 
nation which is feeding off anti-Western Slavic sentiments. His 
success is not surprising. There is great unease in Russia. By 
immediately allowing NATO to extend right up to the borders of 
the former Soviet Union we would be lending force to this 
Slavophile and xenophobic nationalism. As long as the power 
play between the Slavophiles and those who look to the West has 
not been decided, we are right not to enlarge NATO. Because by 
doing so we would be undermining the stability of the continent 
and also of Central Europe. 
  [Oosterwaal] But in the recent past the West already counted 
for too long on a single Soviet leader. 
  [Coolsaet] It is not a question of a single leader, Mikhail 
Gorbachev, Yeltsin, or anyone else. Do not forget that Russia 
has no democratic tradition. Russia has always known autocratic 
government. This has usually been accompanied by a radical 
opposition. This is the second key which we need in order to 
understand anything about Russia. The opposition between 
Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy is a part of this tradition. The only 
real alternative comes from political parties which are born out 
of a pluralist democracy. 
<H5>  Economy </H5>
  Coolsaet believes in the need for stability not just in 
Central Europe but throughout the continent. This was evident 
from his lecture at a recent colloquium at Ghent university. "A 
new world order is growing up gradually, leading to more 
pronounced economic regionalism around three major industrial 
poles : NAFTA in America, Tokyo and Peking in Southeast Asia, 
and Europe. West Europe is not in the best of positions at the 
moment. It is surrounded by turbulent regions which are running 
their economies badly. If Europe still wants to count for 
anything in the 21st century then we cannot remain blind to 
developments outside the borders of the Union. I am not only 
thinking of East Europe. In the long term, the stability of 
Africa is certainly equally important," he stated. 
  The situation is thus very clear to Coolsaet: The military 
alone provides for no stability. George Kennan, the father of 
the postwar policy of containment toward the Soviet Union, knew 
this. Stability has much more to do with economic factors and 
the functioning of institutions. The present power vacuum in 
Central Europe is in some ways comparable to the situation after 
the Second World War. The sense of insecurity was relieved by 
linking the economies, via the European Coal and Steel Community 
and later the European Community. This unification brought 
harmony, peace and prosperity. The European Union could thus 
serve East Europe far better than NATO.

<F P=106> [Article signed CA/TR: "Diplomatic Conflict in Havana"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Since the end of January seven (originally 
eight) Cubans seeking asylum have been staying in the Belgian 
ambassador's residence in Havana. Brussels and Havana have been 
holding talks on finding a solution to the matter. But 
meanwhile, given that both countries are not planning to give up 
their principles, the Cubans could well be staying with the 
ambassador for a long time. In the meantime, Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina has announced that he will hold a 
conference with the Cuban community in exile. [passage omitted] 
  "But all Cubans may leave Cuba if they want to," the Cuban 
embassy spokesman in Belgium said yesterday by phone. "If they 
just follow the standard procedures. They can apply for a visa. 
But it cannot happen this way. Cuba must ensure that the 
immunity of the diplomatic premises in Havana is respected and 
the security of foreign diplomats is not threatened. Therefore, 
we cannot allow such actions." Observers emphasize that it is 
not customary for the host country to decide who visits the 
ambassador. 
  Both Cuban and Belgian diplomats stress that the talks are 
"firm but friendly." But it remains very doubtful whether a 
rapid solution can be found. Both countries have opposite 
opinions on the question and they will not abandon them quickly. 
Very cautious diplomatic action will probably be necessary to 
reach an agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Rolf Falter: "Diplomats Criticize Willy Claes </F>
Over Staes Affair"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels -- According to the Belgian ambassador 
to Pakistan, Ernest Staes, Foreign Minister Willy Claes has 
"caused moral damage that will be hard to repair." This is what 
Ambassador Jean De Ruyt, chairman of the circle of friends (the 
so-called Amicale) of Belgian diplomats wrote in a letter to the 
minister. Last week, De Ruyt published extracts from the letter 
in the Amicale's newsletter. 
  The Staes affair concerns the visit of Muslim leader 
Amanullah Khan from Kashmir to Brussels in October 1993. 
[passage omitted] 
  In his letter, De Ruyt adopts a particularly critical stance 
regarding Willy Claes. Among other things, he writes that in 
instances where the administrative responsibility of an 
ambassador is at issue, "this responsibility may not be 
personalized, nor may it lead to judgments relating to the 
individual involved." 
  "To the extent that various people (in Brussels) were 
involved in the incident, we believe that it would have been 
better to wait until the investigation had yielded the necessary 
elements, before making ambassador responsible for what 
happened." 
  "For someone who has devoted his entire career to the 
department, showing a professional commitment to which many of 
his colleagues could bear witness, these personal attacks (by 
Willy Claes -- DE STANDAARD editor's note), to which he was 
unable to respond, caused moral damage from which it will be 
difficult to recover." 
  De Ruyt went on to indicate that the Amicale was considering 
whether or not to write a letter to the director general of the 
chancellery, in order to point out the problems arising with 
regard to the issuing of the visa. These problems include: A 
"complex mass" of circulars on the affairs, which "in some cases 
seem barely compatible"; the "difficulty of accessing" the 
equipment that provides the "black list," and the fact that only 
alphabetical lists in Roman type are used; and finally, the fact 
that the responsibility is divided between the head of station 
and the chancellor. 
  Let us remember, in the chamber of deputies in recent 
months, 
Minister Claes has stated repeatedly that the instructions for 
issuing visas were "very clear," and "extremely precise."

  [Excerpt] The Hague -- Iranian Ambassador Kazemi-Kamyab was 
summoned to the Foreign Ministry today to hear a strong protest 
following the official statement released by the Iranian 
Government in Teheran that the death sentence against British 
writer Salman Rushdie must indeed be carried out. "The death 
sentence must be carried out, regardless of whether the renegade 
(Rushdie -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note) is repentant," read 
the statement issued yesterday by the official Iranian press 
agency IRNA. The comment was made on the fifth anniversary of 
the death sentence against Rushdie declared by the late 
Ayatollah Khomeyni due to the supposedly blasphemous nature of 
his book The Satanic Verses. 
  Minister Kooijmans wants to push within the Council of 
Ministers for action to be taken against Iran. The Greek 
presidency, according to a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, 
is considering approaching the Iranian Government on behalf of 
the 12 member states of the European Union, in order to show its 
disgust over the Rushdie affair. The Netherlands does not plan 
to scale down its diplomatic relations with Iran, said the 
spokesman. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fokker Cuts Back Primarily on </F>
Production"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- Fokker intends to cut its production 
capability by 1,400 jobs. Approximately 500 jobs will disappear 
at the level of administrative staff and management. 
  The total staff cuts affecting 1,900 jobs are necessary 
because the company's aircraft production is being reduced from 
56 to 40 machines. The measure is a result of the lingering, 
worldwide recession in the aviation sector. 
  According to the company's acting CEO [chief executive 
officer], R.J. van Duinen, the manufacturer probably will have 
to make even deeper cuts next year if the current rate of 
production is maintained. "Fokker is doing relatively well, 
because our market share is growing. However, the self-same 
market has almost totally collapsed," said van Duinen, in an 
attempt to explain the measures. 
  Yesterday morning the staff reacted indignantly, and yet 
stoically, to the announcement that further rationalization is 
in the pipeline. "First of all we want to see what Fokker's 
restructuring plan is based on, and how the management intends 
to limit the number of forced job losses," said P. van Bers and 
G. van den Heuvel, of the trade unions FNV [Netherlands Trade 
Unions Federation] and CNV [National Federation of Christian 
Workers]. G. Melchers, the secretary of the COR [Central 
Enterprise Council], reacted with shock: "We knew that 
something was in the cards, but we had not counted on such a 
high number." 
  According to the financial expert on the board of directors, 
R.F. Hendriksen, the company anticipates a turnaround that will 
drag it out of the red occurring only in 1996. However, this is 
by no means certain, he wisely let it be known. 
<H5>  Development </H5>
  According to van Duinen, the future for Fokker as a 
"self-creating aircraft industry" is not in danger. "The 
restructuring will have a tremendous draining effect. However, 
we shall be proceeding at full speed with product developments 
-- like the new Fokker 70 -- that we have already set in motion. 
Our excellent products have a future. That is why we are doing 
better than our competitors. However, the fact remains that, 
for a company of this size, we are not making enough sales."

Movement by Paolo Borelli in Rome; date not given--recorded; 
Draskovic and Borelli speak in English with voice-over in 
Italian paraphrasing their questions and answers] 
  [Text] Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the opposition in 
Belgrade and therefore the main enemy, at least ideologically, 
of Serb President Milosevic, is paying a visit to Rome. He will 
have meetings with Foreign Minister Andreatta and with Chamber 
of Deputies Speaker Giorgio Napolitano and Senate Speaker 
Giovanni Spadolini. Draskovic will outline his peace plan for 
the former Yugoslavia during his talks with them. Paolo Borelli 
reports: 
  [Borelli] You have opposed the war and Milosevic. Milosevic 
sent you to prison last year. Why is it that this same 
Milosevic is talking to your movement and saying he is ready for 
peace? 
  [Draskovic] Milosevic, like Tudjman, is being forced by the 
facts to make peace. Yes, it is strange that those who started 
the war have now become the champions of peace. But this is not 
the first time this has happened. In Israel, Menachem Begin, 
who had a terrorist, anti-Palestinian guerrilla background, 
received a Nobel prize for peace with Egypt. 
  [Borelli] What will happen when the ultimatum expires on 
Sunday night [20 February]? 
  [Draskovic] The Bosnian Serbs must give up the siege of 
Sarajevo completely. I think they will do so. This means that 
first they have to place all their arms under the control of the 
UN forces in the city and its surrounding area. The second 
step, according to my party's plan, calls for Croats and Muslims 
to place their weapons under UN control also. The third step 
will be the disarming of the three sides and the handing over of 
war criminals for trial. The process of disarmament should be 
carried out by the soldiers of the four powers: the United 
States and British should disarm the Croats and Muslims; Russia 
and the French should disarm the Serbs.

<F P=106> [Report by Gianluca Luzi: "De Mita Gives In to Segni"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Ciriaco de Mita, former prime minister, 
former secretary of the DC [Christian Democratic Party], and 
leader of its left-wing faction, will not be running as a 
candidate in the 28 [as published] March general election. 
Although expected for the past several days, this dramatic 
decision was eventually reached last night at Piazza del Gesu, 
where the Italian Popular Party [PPI] leadership met to decide 
on its candidates for the various constituencies. The thankless 
task of conveying the news to De Mita fell to the PPI's Campania 
coordinator, Ortensio Zecchino, who went to the former DC 
secretary's home at around 2100 hours [2000 GMT]. De Mita's 
exclusion set the seal on a tense, agitated, and exciting day 
that seemed to alternate constantly between a break down and a 
resumption of negotiations with Segni's Pact. 
  "There must be goodwill on both sides. I have it, but Segni, 
too, must not allow himself to be angered by a few former 
Christian Democrats who want to wage a nonexistent war on a DC 
that no longer exists." It was 1830 hours [1730 GMT] when [PPI 
Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli emerged from his office on the 
second floor of Palazzo Cenci Bolognetti for a coffee at the 
corner bar. There had been a constant stream of people in and 
out of the building all day. Popular Party officials shuttling 
between Piazza del Gesu and Largo del Nazareno, Mario Segni's 
headquarters. Representatives from the electoral constituencies 
arguing lost causes. At one point adman Gavino Sanna appeared. 
Would he be taking care of the Pact's election campaign? "No," 
Sanna smiled. "What election campaign is there for me to 
conduct, if there is not even a product to advertise." 
  The atmosphere was tense: On the one hand there was the 
demand made by Segni's Pact to stamp even the PPI's candidates 
with its own symbol. On the other there was the pride of 
Martinazzoli's new grouping, which did not want to give the 
impression of excessive submissiveness. And, although everyone 
swore that actual names had not yet been discussed, there was 
the main problem -- the candidates for the Irpinia 
constituencies that Segni absolutely rejects, starting with De 
Mita. 
  Throughout the afternoon rumors emerged from the Directorate 
offices concerning the electoral fate of De Mita, Mancino, 
Mattarella, and Gargani. They are out; no, they are running. 
De Mita is out, but is competing on his own with a party of his 
own. These are not just nobodies: Mattarella is one of the 
symbols of renewal. De Mita, Mancino, and Gargani are the 
essence of the DC left, and in Irpinia they represent what is 
still a very substantial source of votes. To resist the demands 
of Segni and the Pact was not only a matter of pride for the 
PPI, but also a matter of electoral logic. Before setting off 
for Largo del Nazareno in midafternoon, Pierluigi Castagnetti, 
political secretariat chief, explained: "Mattarella and Mancino 
are not under investigation. The charges against Mattarella are 
entirely without foundation, as any idiot knows. Mancino has 
received no notices of investigation." Giampaolo D'Andrea, a 
close aide of Martinazzoli's, added: "There is no issue as 
regards Mancino; there is none because there is no issue 
regarding individuals; it is a procedural matter." As he left 
Piazza del Gesu Giuseppe Gargani pointed out that the PPI in 
Irpinia had been successful in the runoffs: "My candidacy? I 
am just awaiting a decision by the party." At last the 
decisions came: De Mita will not be fielded. Mattarella will 
head the list for Palermo. Mancino (the Interior Ministry had 
Segni redesign his symbol for the proportional vote) will be 
competing for a seat in the Senate, while Gargani will stand in 
his single-candidate constituency. 
  An agreement between Martinazzoli and Segni is very close. 
"I consider it important," the PPI secretary said, "to point 
out that I have sought, and am still seeking, a political 
operation. If Segni is not presuming to carry out a take over, 
he has no reason not to recognize, as I do, the rationale behind 
this attempt, which is above all important for the Italian 
people, because it will prevent the scene from being dominated 
by a competition between blocs that are at the same time both 
the result of quick-change acts and dangerous." In other words, 
Martinazzoli is saying that, as long as Segni does not presume 
to be the PPI's leader too, agreement can be reached and the 
center can hope to achieve something in the elections. 
  "Agreements are established when the end is reached," 
Martinazzoli warned. "We are exchanging views on the names of 
candidates, and I believe that as long as there are no excessive 
demands on either side, but an awareness of the political 
importance of an agreement, matters will be resolved. 
Otherwise, they will not." 
  There should be no further obstacles now, though the final 
"stamp of approval" to some extent lies with Segni. Indeed, the 
final selection procedure envisages a meeting between the 
regional coordinators of the Pact and the PPI for a preliminary 
examination of candidates. Then the national officials assess 
the work of the regional coordinators; and, last, only in 
controversial cases, is a decision made by Segni, whose ruling 
is final.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Pact for Italy leader Mario </F>
Segni in Rome on 15 February: "Pact for Italy Leader Explains: 
`I Am Not Acting Out of Stubbornness'"--first paragraph is LA 
REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- Mario Segni's press conference started an 
hour and a half late, and barely lasted 10 minutes. The 
journalists were outraged: Did it make any sense to convene 
them just to read out five lines and then run away? Segni 
listened with some embarrassment to the journalists' protest 
before being swallowed up into the nonstop meeting with the 
Piazza del Gesu [Italian People's Party headquarters] bigwigs. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So then, deputy Segni, have you reached an 
agreement? 
  [Segni] We are going ahead with determination and 
conviction, 
putting forward the Pact for Italy electoral lists. We are 
going ahead in the belief that we must offer the country a 
European political platform, which is modern, moderate, and 
reformist. This evening, or at the latest tomorrow morning 
(this morning -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note), we will complete 
the process of choosing the candidates. We are committed to 
ensuring that they represent a profound renewal, and that there 
will be nobody among them who may still have to settle accounts 
with the law. In my capacity as the coalitions's candidate for 
the premiership, I will express an overall opinion on the 
composition and the drawing up of the lists. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So you are going ahead? 
  [Segni] Policymaking is always a difficult business. 
Attempts to reach broader agreements are often defined as 
"wavering," whereas standing firm on a principle is called 
"stubbornness." We are not wavering and we are not being 
stubborn. I have always had the country's interests at heart. 
It is those same interests which are now guiding my actions. 
We must get down to work with the greatest determination, 
because the future of our country depends on the results we 
achieve. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What about names? 
  [Segni] I do not wish to go into the details, as far as 
names 
are concerned. When the lists are drawn up, we will see the 
results, and then you will be able to judge for yourselves. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Why are you encountering so many 
difficulties, however? 
  [Segni] The difficulty lies in defining the principles, 
detailing the rules, deciding on the candidacies. We have not 
yet mentioned any names, and I do not wish to mention any now. 
However, I am sure that the PPI will follow criteria of 
openness and political clarity.

<F P=106> [Article by Massimo Riva: "Liberal Left"] </F>
  [Text] In a campaign that is gradually spiralling in the 
production of words through the medium of words -- and often of 
insults through the medium of other insults -- the "government 
program" presented by [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, 
Secretary] Achille Occhetto at least has the merit of creating a 
glimmer of hope of rationality and specificity. Having put his 
cards on the table, the leader of the progressive alignment can 
indeed hope that the other competitors will now abandon fatuous 
advertising language and their coarse invective and compete in 
the arena of the things that need to be done at this difficult 
time in the nation's life. In his 50-page document, the PDS 
secretary has made this effort, in a forum and language that 
confirm, better than any number of television interviews, the 
PDS' break with its past as a communist party. 
  First and foremost -- though it is tempting to say, at last 
-- the program no longer features the cathartic inspiration, so 
deep-rooted in the Italian Communist Party's traditional 
documents, that implied a vision of politics as an instrument 
for spreading happiness among people. Nor, logically and as a 
consistent consequence, does it any longer indicate the 
metahistorical objective of a transcending of the market economy 
and therefore of the real conditions of the world as it is now. 
  Indeed, the entire program seems to be rooted firmly in 
these 
very conditions. Indeed, the ultimate goal of the PDS blueprint 
seems to be leading to the acceptance of a market economy in a 
country that, both in the past and in the present, has always 
inclined toward the more comfortable path of protectionism and 
unfair promotion of vested interests. There are two assertions 
in the introduction to Occhetto's program that deserve to be 
examined. 
  The first says that the precondition for rebuilding the 
state 
in Italy "is the existence of a government force that cannot be 
held to ransom by perverse compromises and unknown potentates 
that still influence the republic's life." The second important 
statement is the following: "To help business to create wealth 
is the precondition for possessing the means to allocate to the 
citizens' prosperity, both material and other, and to support 
the underprivileged. We cannot distribute that which we do not 
have." 
  Italy's timid -- or, more often, sham -- adherence to the 
rules of the market economy in recent decades has been at the 
same time both the cause and the effect of a decline in the 
relationship between politics and business that has imposed on 
the country an overall system of government based on partisan 
agreements between those governing the institutions and those 
managing businesses. Now the Left is at last displaying an 
awareness that its battles on behalf of an alternative system 
had no other result than to strengthen, to everyone's detriment, 
the mechanism of secret agreements between political and 
economic bigwigs, in contempt of the golden rules of free 
competition and free trade. 
  Having reached this realization, the Left is now grasping 
and 
espousing the weapon of the market as a means of liberating the 
country from the heel of the political and business oligopolies. 
And it does so through an explicit adherence to one of the 
linchpins of a liberal economy when it states, as we have seen, 
that "we cannot distribute that which we do not have." You can 
turn these words around however you want, but their ultimate 
meaning is not very different from, or is indeed identical to, 
that of the now famous warning issued by the American monetarist 
school, namely, that in modern societies "there is no such thing 
as a free lunch." 
  I do not know whether Occhetto will like this interpretation 
of the document that he presented yesterday or whether it will 
suit him (looking to his left). But the fact is that his 
government program deserves general attention not so much 
because of its numerous and detailed social welfare plans 
(unemployment, social security, health), but rather because of 
its overall approach, which seems to be inspired by the most 
solid principles of democratic and liberal thinking. 
  Liberal, mind -- not liberalist, in accordance with a 
fundamental distinction on which both Benedetto Croce and Luigi 
Einaudi had some excellent things to say. This, particularly 
where it outlines a state that will not submit to the invisible 
and domineering hand of business and that will not claim the 
right to take its place in despising the rights of freedom. 
And, vice versa, of a state that, as a leading actor in 
conflicts, will act as their arbiter, will "manage less and 
govern more, that will do fewer things but that will help others 
to do them." This, precisely in accordance with the teachings 
of the liberal doctrine of the state, in contrast to the 
liberalist anarchism which is only a disguised version of the 
ancient law of the survival of the fittest. 
  Hitherto this election campaign has profoundly disoriented 
the public because of the general and chaotic race by almost all 
the political forces to exclusively appropriate the liberal 
democratic label. Now the Left has specified its stance in this 
area and has defined its identity. It seems highly desirable 
that the other competing groups abandon the generic banalities 
of television commercials and present the voters with their own 
government programs -- equally clear in their principles and 
plans -- in order to start practicing the principles of the 
market and fair competition in politics too. 
  Nobody would dream of suggesting that the PDS' program is a 
kind of cure-all for the country's problems. Indeed, it 
includes some proposals that seem still ill-defined or 
unsupported by adequate arguments -- for instance, where it 
postulates a growth, albeit sacrosanct, in expenditure on 
education of 6-10 percent of GDP, without clarifying to the 
detriment of whom and what this would take place. Be that as it 
may, however, this examination of the good and bad features of 
the PDS program can produce useful and meaningful assessments 
only on the basis of a comparison with the proposals and 
programs of its rivals. 
  To be specific: There are a couple of issues that have 
particularly occupied the start of the election campaign -- 
taxation and the media. With regard to the former, Occhetto 
says that "a reduction in taxation will be achieved as and when 
the general conditions of public finances make it possible." In 
other words, it is necessary first to emerge from the trap of 
the public deficit by bringing inflation down still further, the 
continuation of an incomes policy, and further spending cuts. 
This, essentially, is the policy being pursued by the Ciampi 
government, and we are acquainted with both its advantages and 
its disadvantages. Do Occhetto's rivals have a different 
program in mind? We know that they are talking about cutting 
taxes, but what do they intend to do about the public deficit? 
To deal with it by means of inflation and by printing money? 
Or by means of something less destructive? It would be helpful 
if they were to say. 
  As for the media, Occhetto proposes reversing the rationale 
of the "perverse compromises" -- again -- behind current 
legislation, centering the defense of the public not on the 
vested interests of the existing bigwigs but on the citizens' 
right to pluralism in their sources of information. What are 
the other rival political forces offering as an alternative? 
Some further compromises in line with the oligopolistic Mammi 
bill, or a real opening to this market based on the principles 
of competition? It would be helpful to know this, too, in order 
to assess the liberal substance of Occhetto's proposals: It is 
possible to do better than him, but someone has to do it.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Writing in the 29 January Lisbon weekly 
SEMANARIO, Jaime Nogueira Pinto accuses unidentified Portuguese 
government officials of ignoring the fact that Jonas Savimbi's 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) can 
resist "indefinitely" the Angolan Government's attacks, and also 
of believing that the South African elections can significantly 
modify the situation in Angola. Such an attitude, Nogueira Pinto 
contends, "cannot stand up to serious and objective analysis." 
In fact, the responsibility for continued warfare must be 
attributed to the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola 
(MPLA) and the so-called military bourgeoisie, the hardline 
nucleus of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
(FAPLA), which is earning huge commissions on military 
purchases, Nogueira Pinto maintains. In fact, this is the 
faction that rejects a negotiated peace with UNITA--since it 
would mean a loss of power--even as it is loath to lose the 
"respectability" laboriously won in the Washington talks. Hence, 
the continous "provocations" against Savimbi in spite of U.S. 
warnings to Luanda about renewed military escalation. Lisbon's 
interests in Angola will obviously be served by the 
reestablishment of a just and fair peace, to be achieved only 
through compromise and power sharing, Nogueira Pinto concludes.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The Portuguese press recently reported 
on Admiral Antonio Carlos Fuzeta da Ponte, said to be the 
strongest contender for the position of Armed Forces chief of 
staff that is being vacated by retiring General Soares Carneiro. 
  According to the 3 February Lisbon weekly VISAO, Fuzeta da 
Ponte, 59, was born in Setubal in a family of lawyers. Breaking 
with family tradition, he entered the Naval Academy after 
attending Lisbon University's Faculty of Science. Acquaintances 
note his "fighting spirit and clear perception of how to get 
ahead." While his former Academy classmates consider him "highly 
intelligent," they also affirm that behind his "irreverence" he 
hides "ambition, a thirst for notoriety, and personal vanity." 
He was graduated second in a class noted for its brilliance. His 
arduous work did not hinder him from loving fun and playing the 
latest tunes on the piano after a three-year stint at the 
Conservatory. VISAO quotes former Minister Correia Jesuino as 
saying that "it was impossible to be sad in the presence of this 
jovial and exuberant extrovert with a good sense of humor." 
Along with music, swimming, and sailing were his favorite 
hobbies. The admiral is known to be "charming" and "loquacious." 
Those close to him, the weekly continues, maintain he has a 
strong personality and temperament. He is also "impulsive" and 
"can easily make enemies." According to fellow Adm. Sousa 
Cerejeiro, he is also demanding, both of himself and others. 
  Fuzeta da Ponte, the weekly continues, is considered 
"unique" 
in the Navy, for he became its chief without ever having 
commanded a ship. A specialist in electronics, he spent five 
years in Africa during the colonial war at the Hydrographic 
Mission in Angola and Sao Tome. From October 1989 to February 
1991, he was head of the National Military Mission to NATO. 
Promoted to the rank of admiral in 1991, he was appointed chief 
of the Navy General Staff. Sousa Cerejeiro is cited as saying 
that the absence of ship command experience stems from the fact 
that not all admirals can have a turn at commanding a ship, 
given the fleet's limited size, and is not due to lack of 
aptitude. 
  VISAO also reports that Fuzeta da Ponte is married to an 
Englishwoman, Mary Jane. They have a son, a daughter, and two 
grandchildren. 
  Fuzeta da Ponte's probable appointment as chief of staff may 
be jeopardized by a 28 May 1975 video cassette, reports Isaias 
Gomes Teixeira in the 4 February Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE. 
The cassette shows an interview with Fuzeta da Ponte, then civil 
governor of Setubal, "one of the country's most leftist 
districts," after a meeting between Armed Forces officials, 
"representatives of the people" and the admiral, Gomes Teixeira 
writes. In the interview, Fuzeta da Ponte defined "capitalism" 
and "international imperialism" as the "enemies of the April 
Revolution." He is also quoted as saying in the interview that a 
strategy was needed to defeat the "enemy's attack." In this 
strategy, he said, "Setubal has a lot to say about the progress 
of the Revolution." While Teixeira considers the admiral 
"competent, dynamic, a good strategist, and experienced in 
international affairs," he also reports that in the opinion of 
certain military and political sectors Fuzeta da Ponte lacks the 
necessary qualities to become Armed Forces chief of staff. These 
sectors are quoted by Gomes Teixeira as saying that "to be a 
leader one has to be respected: Fuzeta is not." 
  Finally, Gomes Teixeira charges that the admiral, suspected 
of having been too close to Portugal's dictatorship in the 
sixties, gradually modified his convictions as the Revolution 
seemed to make gains during his term as Setubal governor. 
"Perhaps this is why the admiral's official curriculum did not 
mention his governorship when handed to the press," Gomes 
Teixeira notes.

<F P=106> [Article by Carla Aguiar: "The End of Social Distribution"] </F>
  [Editorial Report] The very foundations of social security 
are threatened by an earthquake of gigantic dimensions called 
"aging." The social security financing system presently rests on 
the contributions of 3.5 active citizens per retired worker, a 
situation already responsible for large state deficits. 
  However, were the system to continue unchanged, prospects 
are 
even more disquieting, given that in 60 years, barely 1.3 
percent of active workers will pay the costs for each retiree. 
This means that in the year 2050, each worker will bear alone 
the almost entire amount a retiree costs. 
  Within this scenario, the system's financial burden may 
"grow 
7.5 times," from 300 million contos distributed in 1990 in old 
age pensions to almost 2.3 billion contos, meaning that the 
system's deficit will rise to "unconscionable heights." 
  This is the point of departure chosen by the authors of the 
book Financing Retirement: The Contribution of the 
Insurance Sector to reach alternative solutions. [passage 
omitted] They advocate the adoption of a mixed, noncompulsory 
system at the company or individual level, leading to the 
accumulation of funds whose management may be entrusted to 
entities specializing in this type of activity, such as, for 
instance, insurance companies or pension fund managers. 
  While three other types of theoretical solutions are 
possible, "their practical applications entail difficulties": 
pensions can be reduced, the retirement age can be pushed back, 
or contributions can be increased during a worker's active life. 
  Despite the fear expressed by the specialists with regard to 
the first two solutions, given the Portuguese social reality of 
"small pensions with companies increasingly resorting to early 
retirements," the government did not hesitate to postpone the 
retirement age and modify the basis for computing retirements, 
an initiative that resulted in smaller pensions in a number of 
cases. The new social security law also increased the 
contributions of self-employed workers.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 1 February Lisbon weekly O DIABO 
notes that over 20,000 Chinese immigrants from the PRC and Hong 
Kong may arrive in Portugal from Macao. Once in that territory, 
which does not have a Chinese consulate, these individuals can 
legally obtain a Portuguese special passport for foreigners, a 
tourist document of a different color that does not bear the 
inscription "European community" and entitles the bearer to a 
90-day stay in Portugal with a right of renewal. The paper 
expresses the fear that members of the "Triade," the Oriental 
Mafia involved in gambling, prostitution, and money laundering, 
may be included among the immigrants, as has already occurred in 
Italy and Spain. It also notes that both Portugal and a number 
of European governments are concerned about the easy entrance 
into Portugal of such immigrants, who can then travel 
uncontrolled to other parts of Europe.

  [Text] In various meetings with officials of the Greek 
Cypriot side, Western diplomats are issuing indirect but clear 
threats for measures that could be taken against our side if we 
reject or obstruct the implementation of the confidence-building 
measures. These threats relate mainly to the financial situation 
of the country, which they warn will be hurt by certain moves 
that their countries will make. 
  According to our information, beyond the threat for gradual 
recognition of the pseudostate in the occupied areas which--as 
they say--will not be prevented, they also talk about the 
withdrawal of UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus]. They stress that 
such a development would cause a climate of insecurity in 
Cyprus, which could easily hurt the country's main financial 
source, tourism! 
  Let us recall that clear reference to UNFICYP's withdrawal 
was repeatedly made by the UN secretary general in his reports. 
  Officials from our side who talked with foreign diplomats 
confirm that especially the United States and Britain indicate 
everytime their determination to impose the confidence-building 
measures. And this is the meaning of their indirect but clear 
threats.

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf </F>
Denktas by correspondent Basaran Duzgun in Nicosia; date not 
given--punctuation as published] 
  [Text] [Duzgun] Can you explain the current status of the 
confidence-building measures? 
  [Denktas] The Cyprus problem is on the UN Security Council's 
table. Several proposals have been made on the problem from 
time to time. It has been debated for a long time. However, no 
results have been achieved. The reason for that is the Greek 
Cypriot side's determination to function as the legal Cyprus 
government. The Greek Cypriots wish neither to reduce nor to 
lose completely what they have gained from using the legal title 
of the Cyprus Government. They intend to achieve their 
objective by having the Turkish Cypriots agree to join a 
partnership administration. That obstacle has prolonged the 
Cyprus problem for 30 years. 
  The UN officials and the countries that provide funds to 
maintain the UN troops on the island, particularly the United 
States, are determined to have the problem solved. The approach 
they have used with us during the past year has been more 
serious than in the past. 
  The Butrus-Ghali set of ideas was proposed when Yeoryios 
Vasiliou was in power in south Cyprus. He misled the world by 
saying that he agreed to the set of ideas. Meanwhile, he used 
our wish to make changes in the set of ideas as an opportunity 
to engage successfully in trickery, saying that the Turkish 
Cypriot side had refused to hold talks and had abandoned the 
negotiating table. Then we proposed to hold talks on each and 
every paragraph of the set of ideas. Vasiliou placed 
reservations on all the paragraphs when we arrived at that 
point. He avoided responsibility by saying that he only agreed 
to discuss the set of ideas not agree to them. Vasiliou's 
behavior convinced those who supported him until that time that 
he was not a trustworthy person. 
  When Glavkos Kliridhis came to power he failed to adopt a 
favorable approach to the set of ideas, saying that significant 
changes must be made and that the set of ideas could not be 
considered until those changes were made. The UN officials, who 
maintained a shuttle mission between us, ascertained that the 
Greek Cypriots would not agree to the changes we wished to make 
and the Turkish Cypriots would not agree to those that the Greek 
Cypriots wished to make. They then said: "It seems that you do 
not trust each other. Therefore, let us consider the package on 
confidence-building measures." The UN secretary general 
dispatched his experts to Cyprus when we outlined the problems 
we established. We studied the report the experts drew up and 
arrived at the conclusion that we could include many provisions 
in the package, which was described as being very much in favor 
of the Turkish Cypriots. 
  So, we called on the Greek Cypriot side to agree to hold 
talks on the matter. As soon as we did so, the Greek Cypriots 
described the experts' report as an invalid document and said 
that it could not be placed on the negotiating table. The Greek 
Cypriot leaders, excluding Kliridhis, then adopted a negative 
approach against the package. Nevertheless, Kliridhis said: "I 
am daring enough to do anything that will be in my people's 
interest. I do not receive orders from anyone. I am prepared 
to hold talks on the package for the cause I believe in and my 
people's interests." 
  However, Glavkos Kliridhis signed a defense agreement with 
Greece when preparations were made for the talks on the package. 
He said that he was committed to his EOKA [Greek Cypriot 
underground nationalist organization] oath, he had not forgotten 
the oath he took on the Greek flag, and he would not allow 
Cyprus to be further reduced in size. 
  Yes, those are the realities with which we are confronted. 
Several of our colleagues have suggested that we should not 
agree to "maintain the talks." However, we are not alone at the 
negotiating table. We must bear in mind that Turkey has 
responsibilities to the Turkish Cypriots and to the 
international community. Important decisions like that must be 
made with Turkey -- that is, if the time and conditions are 
right. We cannot say that we have decided not to hold talks, 
because we have realized that the Greek Cypriots do not wish to 
reach an agreement with us and have prolonged the Cyprus problem 
for that reason for 30 years. Unfortunately, the international 
community has not yet realized that the Greek Cypriots do not 
wish to reach an agreement. Therefore, we shall hold talks to 
either explain that situation to the world or conclude a 
balanced agreement with the Greek Cypriots in line with our 
interests. 
  Can Maras [Varosha] be given up and returned? No, nothing 
can be given up and returned. However, if we are to take 
something in return, something that will be in our interest, 
then we shall inform the people. We shall say: That is what 
has been proposed in return. This is the value of the place we 
may give up, a place that has been empty and in which our 
authority has not been recognized. And the people will decide. 
  Kliridhis said yesterday that he will hold a referendum on 
the agreement he may reach on the package. I welcomed his 
statement because we also have to hold a referendum in 
accordance with our Constitution. 
  [Duzgun] Will a referendum be held in north Cyprus on the 
package of confidence-building measures? 
  [Denktas] We have to hold a referendum. However, Kliridhis 
may or may not do so. We have to hold a referendum in 
accordance with our Constitution. We have to maintain the talks 
with a calm approach. No one can force us to sign an agreement, 
saying that we have reached this or that point. It is the two 
sides that will sign the agreement to be reached. We shall not 
decide whether or not the agreement we have reached is in our 
people's interest. We shall ask the people to decide. 
  [Duzgun] You have said that you are maintaining your cause 
with Turkey. It has been reported that your current relations 
with Turkey are the best they have ever been. 
  [Denktas] Our relations with Turkey have always been very 
good. Turkey has supported us whenever we found ourselves in 
difficulty. We have resolved our problems through consultations 
and agreements with Turkey. 
  I was grieved to read a number of statements and reports 
against the Turkish Foreign Ministry a few days ago. The 
Turkish Foreign Ministry has carried the burden of the Cyprus 
problem for many years. Very capable officials have worked in 
that ministry, officials whom we trusted. Some of them have 
retired and others have been promoted. They have not forgotten 
Cyprus, however, because they have regarded the Cyprus issue as 
a national problem and have worked hard. It is wrong to accuse 
the Turkish Foreign Ministry and its officials when the 
negotiating process is continuing. That will dishearten them. 
I believe we are in a difficult stage. 
  Nevertheless, I have experienced similar stages in the past. 
An example is the time I held talks with Glavkos Kliridhis in 
1968. Several reports said at the time that we had reached an 
agreement and that I had betrayed the Turkish Cypriot cause. 
Another example was during the era of former President Turgut 
Ozal in Turkey. Several claims were made at the time that he 
agreed to give Cyprus away to end the problem. Similar claims 
are being made at the present time. We have to be patient. We 
are all aware of the Greek Cypriot side's nature, so we must not 
allow it to mislead us. 
  [Duzgun] Can you resist against similar attacks? 
  [Denktas] We wish to conclude an agreement that will be in 
our best interest. Otherwise, we shall not do so because we 
have been promised that the Turkish Cypriot side will 
significantly gain from the package. Let us wait and see if the 
package will provide for cooperation, coexistence, and financial 
opportunities. Let us wait and see if it will include travel 
for Turkish Cypriots to wherever they wish to go with Turkish 
Cypriot passports? Considering all that, sitting at the 
negotiating table to hold talks is not a crime, it is a duty. 
  [Duzgun] The package on confidence-building measures 
consists of three documents related to Maras, Nicosia Airport, 
and measures aimed at promoting relations between the two 
communities. 
  [Denktas] The question of Pyle is included among them. Also 
included is the question of foreign aid the Turkish Cypriots 
will receive... 
  [Duzgun] Regarding the confidence-building measures, the UN 
Security Council report, dated 1 July 1993, only mentions Maras 
and Nicosia Airport. What about the other measures? Are they 
not on the agenda? 
  [Denktas] Yes, they are on the agenda. A disclosure will be 
made tomorrow (today). You will see that they are on the 
agenda. We have discussed them for several days and included 
them on the agenda. 
  [Duzgun] Can you explain the agenda for the indirect talks? 
  [Denktas] That will be disclosed when Joe Clark arrives in 
Cyprus. 
  [Duzgun] Does a problem exist on the agenda? 
  [Denktas] No, a problem does not exist. We have finalized 
it. 
  [Duzgun] You said after conferring with Gustav Feissel that 
you "do not wish to tread on anything slippery." Has an 
initiative been made to make you say that? 
  [Denktas] The difficulty was to have the 12 provisions 
included and proceed on the assumption that they exist. 
  [Duzgun] Are you frequently confronted with similar 
initiatives? 
  [Denktas] Naturally, similar initiatives will be made. 
Kliridhis will try to safeguard the Greek Cypriot side's 
interests and I will try to safeguard the Turkish Cypriot side's 
interests. He will try to have me tread on slippery ground and I 
will reciprocate in the same way when our interests clash. Yes, 
he will try that if he can. 
  [Duzgun] Can you comment on the concrete gains of the 
Turkish 
Cypriots when the package on confidence-building measures is 
implemented? 
  [Denktas] Let us discuss that matter when the talks are 
resumed. First, let us see what they are prepared to give. 
  [Duzgun] Is there nothing concrete at the present time? 
  [Denktas] No, nothing concrete exists. We shall see what 
will happen when the talks resume. 
  [Duzgun] Will the Turkish Cypriots be able to fly from 
Nicosia Airport to wherever they wish to travel with their TRNC 
[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] passports? 
  [Denktas] That is among the promises that have been made to 
us. 
  [Duzgun] Reports say that Britain and the United States will 
move to facilitate the solution to that problem. They will 
suggest that the TRNC passports... 
  [Denktas] Yes, they will suggest to all the European 
countries that they treat the TRNC passports as they do. Yes, 
those are the promises. We have moved to resume our work on the 
basis of those promises. Nothing will be achieved if they are 
not fulfilled. 
  [Duzgun] Do you wish to make a statement before the talks 
resume? 
  [Denktas] No, I believe that making lengthy statements is 
unnecessary. Meanwhile, Kliridhis is making lengthy statements. 
In fact, he has indicated that several of our colleagues, who 
expressed the view that "the Greek Cypriots have changed," were 
wrong. I hope that Mr. Clark will assess that state of affairs. 
I also hope that no one will think that we are stupid. 
  [Duzgun] Can you comment on your work with the government on 
the Cyprus problem? 
  [Denktas] I can say that we are working in harmony. My 
complaints are those of my country. The people have not allowed 
the government members to work for several days. A lot of time 
has been wasted by visits and the offering of coffee. There is 
less of that at the present time. 
  [Duzgun] Have you found the harmony you expected in your 
work 
with the government on the Cyprus problem? 
  [Denktas] I cannot complain. We are working in harmony. 
Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur attends the meetings. I 
believe that he has no complaints. I have no complaints, 
either. We are working in harmony and complying with the 
realities. The burden will be easier to carry if responsible 
people act in accordance with their responsibilities. It will 
be difficult to carry shared responsibilities if any of those 
officials forget how responsible they are and make irrelevant 
statements. We have experienced that state of affairs in the 
past. Hopefully, we shall not do so in the future.

<F P=106> [By Laurence Chabert] </F>
  [Text] Nicosia, Feb 17 (AFP) -- Despite Cyprus' denial, 
diplomats here insist that Serbians are taking advantage of the 
strong Christian orthodox solidarity with them in this 
Mediterranean island to breach UN sanctions. 
  The local press last week quoted a report from the 
Brussels-based UN sanctions committee (SANCOMM) giving Cyprus 
good marks for its enforcement of the embargo on the rump 
Yugoslavia, which groups Serbia and Montenegro. 
  Since SANCOMM was created, in October 1992, it has sent only 
41 enquiry requests to Cyprus, out of a total of 6,000, and 
"Cyprus unlike other countries, carried out most of those 
(enquiries)," SANCOMM chief Richard Vork told AFP. 
  Cyprus wants to abide by the international resolutions, 
because they also provide for Turkey to clear the northern part 
of the island it occupies since 1974, Central Bank official 
Spiros Stavrinakis said. 
  Cyprus even "went beyond UN wishes" concerning Yugoslavia, 
and all transactions with countries neighbouring Serbia and 
Montenegro are so much "closely monitored that Croatia has 
complained," he added. 
  But a diplomat said monitoring is difficult since Serbian 
companies are registered here as off-shore, and do not carry on 
business with Cyprus. 
  "The Cypriots' control bothers no one, trafficking is very 
difficult to monitor since it is mainly financial," he said, 
asking not to be named. 
  For example, a Serbian private company in Cyprus might pay 
for an oil shipment stocked in Greece to go to Hungary. Hence, 
no deal is done with Serbia, but, at the same time, no one can 
check that the shipment really went to Hungary, and was not 
diverted to Serbia or Montenegro, the diplomat explained. 
  "We cannot check their activities," reckons Dhimitrios 
Khatzikostis, chief of the Cyprus customs enquiry department. 
"To date, we did not uncover any violation of the sanctions. 
Two or three cases are under investigation," he added. 
  Some of the Serbian companies existed in Cyprus before the 
United Nations security council voted the sanctions, in 1992, 
but hundreds were created in the days following the vote. At 
that time, "Yugoslavs came with suitcases filled with money," a 
diplomat recalled. 
  American and British central banks have sent several 
delegations from April to October 1993 to push Cyprus into 
enforcing the embargo, he said. "Controls have improved since, 
but they did not go to the bottom of things." 
  Ten Serbian companies listed as suspect by the U.S. Treasury 
Department have branches in Cyprus, he added. Some of them seem 
to have kept the same level of activity as before the sanctions 
were imposed, although their assets were frozen. 
  Cyprus' Central bank did not disclose the number of Serbian 
off-shore companies, but the most prominent are Beogradska Bank, 
here since 1988 and very active before the embargo, state 
trading firms like Yugo-Arab and Yugo-Metal, and Unibros, a 
private trading company. 
  None of these companies, which are accused of breaching the 
embargo by the Western media, agreed to answer AFP's questions. 
  The Central Bank has assigned two employees to watch over 
the 
activities of Beogradska Bank. Its overt operations range from 
sponsoring Serbian painting exhibitions to hosting the 
Cyprus-Serbia humanitarian association activities. 
  This group told AFP it collected 4,000 dollars to buy 
medicines, that later were sent to Belgrade with travellers, to 
circumvent a UN authorization. 
  Cyprus and Yugoslavia had close ties, mainly within the 
Non-Aligned movement. Thousands of former Yugoslavs, mainly 
Serbians, live in Cyprus -- 2,198, according the interior 
ministry, much more according to diplomats. 
  Public opinion as reflected in Parliament or the media is 
largely pro-Serbian, and the Cyprus Orthodox Church last year 
offered 200,000 dollars to its counterpart in Serbia. 
  Conservative MP Tasos Papadhopoulos has even spoken against 
Cyprus enforcing the sanctions, branding them as 
"anti-constitutional."

  [Excerpts] Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has held 
a joint news conference with the president of Hungary, who is 
continuing his official visit to Spain. Felipe Gonzalez said 
that Spain will support the process of Hungary's integration 
into the European Union once the corresponding period of 
adaptation has passed. 
  Asked about a possible withdrawal of the Spanish blue 
helmets 
deployed in the former Yugoslavia if the conflict worsens, 
Felipe Gonzalez said the Spanish Government will not make a 
unilateral decision on this, but rather in the context of the 
commitment agreed with its partners in the European Union. He 
said, however, that security measures are envisaged and 
expressed his hope that the situation will improve. [passage 
omitted] 
  At the news conference on the occasion of the Hungarian 
president's visit, Prime Minister Gonzalez said he is against 
sending more reinforcements of blue helmets to the city of 
Sarajevo, as requested by General Rose. However, he is not 
opposed to a change of position by the Spanish blue helmets. 
Here is what he said: 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] In Bosnia I have to say that the 
effort for us is at the limit of our possibilities from the 
human point of view -- you know this well. I have said as much 
on a number of other occasions. A change in our deployment in 
the territory can always be studied, if it were useful, but for 
the time being that is not a question which has been raised. We 
occupy a place in the territory of great importance from all 
points of view, but, naturally, we are open to cooperating with 
the other UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces in whatever is 
necessary. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Javier Solana and Defense Minister 
Julian Garcia Vargas are in the Congress of Deputies to explain 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Shortly before making his 
address, Solana said that the final decision on air strikes on 
Bosnian Serb positions is up to the military command of the UN 
peacekeeping force on the ground in accordance with the legal 
framework of the United Nations and NATO. Martin Garcia Vega 
reports from the Congress of Deputies: 
  [Garcia Vega] Javier Solana said definitive conclusions 
cannot be drawn from the statements made by the warring sides at 
such a delicate time. He was speaking to journalists in the 
lobby. The Spanish foreign minister prefers to look at the 
positive aspects of some actions. 
  [Begin Solana recording] For the first time in a long while 
we have a several day ceasefire holding in Sarajevo. This means 
that Sarajevo, at the moment, is a city which is no longer 
shelled. Therefore, there are no victims in Sarajevo. Something 
like this has not happened in months. If only this has been 
achieved, then perhaps all the efforts we have engaged, on the 
diplomatic front over the past few weeks, have been worth it. 
[end recording] 
  [Garcia Vega] Solana and Garcia Vargas are now addressing 
the 
Congress outlining the situation in the area.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou before the </F>
Government Committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies 
building--live] 
  [Text] From the beginning, with its policy statement and 
later with the foreign minister's letter to the UN secretary 
general and UN Security Council permanent members, our 
government made its position on Skopje clear. Greece remains 
ready to develop good neighborly relations and close cooperation 
with Skopje, thus contributing substantially to its development 
and prosperity. Greece remains a country that is really well 
disposed toward Skopje. Greece remains ready to participate in a 
dialogue with Skopje under the UN auspices. From the time Skopje 
was accepted in the United Nations, through the formation of the 
current government -- and despite the previous Greek Government, 
according to its policy, participating in a dialogue with Skopje 
-- we have noted the continuous aggravation of Skopje's 
provocation, its intransigence, and its deceitful offensive 
propaganda. 
  Since the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia and the 
creation of the issue of Skopje, Skopje has taken no 
conciliatory or prudent step. Indeed, since that time, Skopje 
has set in motion a constitutional document in a strongly 
offensive context and very provocatively adopted historic Greek 
symbols, including the Star of Veryina, which was hitherto 
unknown, foreign, and uninteresting for them. 
  Greece's firm and principle goal is peace, stability, and 
security in the greater region. To serve this goal and to make 
the relevant UN decisions credible and real, Greece asked for 
something that should have been self-explanatory. Greece asked 
Skopje for specific and practical steps to indicate its 
willingness to abandon the increasingly offensive propaganda 
against Greece through points in its constitution and its 
symbolism. 
  These specific signs are not Greek conditions but, in the 
final analysis, are Skopje's commitments born out of 
international law. Greece has stated that if Skopje had taken 
these necessary, practical steps, it could have examined the 
possibility of lifting its objections to Skopje's accession to 
the CSCE. 
  As Skopje's intransigence continued, even intensified, many 
members of the international community, including member 
countries of the European Union and recently the United States, 
established diplomatic relations or recognized Skopje, most of 
course with the name FYROM [the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia]. Greece does not want to comment on the evaluations 
and motives behind these moves. The result, though, was that 
Skopje misinterpreted all these moves, which gave the illusion 
that it can be indifferent to the Greek positions and the 
problems it causes for the stability of the greater area. 
  [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov's recent impudent 
letter 
to U.S. President Bill Clinton proves to Greece that Skopje does 
not appear to realize the special or unique importance of 
normalizing its relations with Greece or the problems it causes 
with its behavior in a particularly sensitive area. 
  Greece, a member of the European Union and presiding over 
the 
Union during this half of the year, a member of NATO and the 
CSCE, and a country with an institutional, social, and economic 
structure that places it firmly in Western civilization, is 
obliged to act as the primary guarantor of peace, stability, and 
security in the region. Greece is obliged to undertake -- it 
does -- and assume initiatives in this direction, centering on 
the Yugoslav crisis and the tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Greece is obliged to foster respect for international law and 
play a major role in implementing UN decisions. Consequently, 
Greece is obliged, especially in the current international 
arena, to restate with absolute clarity the framework of its own 
positions and actions. Unfortunately, because the reasons, no 
matter how hard and firm they are, are undermined or 
misinterpreted, Greece is obliged to state its position with 
specific actions. 
  The Greek Government has decided: 1. To suspend operations 
at 
its general consulate in Skopje, and 2. To suspend the movement 
of goods to and from Skopje through the port of Thessaloniki. 
The exception is that which is absolutely necessary for 
humanitarian purposes, such as food and medicine. 
  The Greek Government's decision today constitutes a message 
to Skopje and to others, including all those who participate in 
formulating the positions of the international community. 
Greece is always ready to participate in a dialogue with Skopje 
under UN auspices, as long as this dialogue is honest and 
substantive and always given our country's position regarding 
the name of Skopje. Something like this, though, is subject to 
-- and everyone had better understand this -- the specific and 
practical signs that Skopje must show. Unfortunately, there has 
been no sign that it understands the reality and the prospects. 
Thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alexis Papakhelas from Washington] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. State Department leadership is putting 
pressure on the White House to exchange ambassadors with the 
Skopje government soon. The issue is currently being discussed 
by the White House National Security Council and a decision 
could be made by the end of the week. 
  Reliable sources say that Skopjean President Kiro Gligorov 
unofficially assured the State Department that he will make a 
vague statement promising to begin immediate negotiations with 
his government and the parliament to cancel Skopje's flag if the 
United States proceeds in establishing diplomatic relations and 
Greece agrees to continue dialogue under the auspices of Cyrus 
Vance. 
  The State Department believes that diplomatic relations 
should be established by 1 March, arguing that the political 
cost for Greece would be less if this happened now rather than 
later. At the same time, the Americans do not want the exchange 
of ambassadors to coincide with the Greek prime minister's visit 
to the United States, which is scheduled for 22 April. 
  U.S. diplomats are also arguing that the crisis in Bosnia 
and 
the possibility of air raids makes it necessary to handle 
immediately any pending issues in U.S.-Skopjean relations. The 
United States has noted the nationalistic upsurge that has been 
going on in Greece during the last few days but believes that it 
will not turn into tangible, harsh measures against Skopje in 
the economic relations sector.

  [Text] Salonika, Greece, Feb 15 (AFP)--Eggs were hurled at 
the U.S. consulate here whose shutters stayed closed as tens of 
thousands of demonstrators protested Tuesday [15 February] 
against Washington's recognition of Macedonia. 
  Led by Greek Orthodox priests, they gathered at the church 
of 
Ayia Sofia to march to the consulate behind Greek flags and 
crosses. Orthodox Metropolitan Pandeleimon read a statement 
attacking President Bill Clinton's "criminal act" and the 
"indecent behaviour" of the United States. 
  Athens is fighting a losing battle against the international 
recognition of the former Yugoslav republic, which it claims has 
expansionist aims. It says only Greece's northern province can 
bear the name of Macedonia. 
  Most European Community countries decided to have diplomatic 
links with Skopje in December, the United States followed suit 
last week, while the latest was Australia Tuesday. Russia has 
also taken a similar step. 
  Many students who had been bussed into Thessaloniki while 
their schools were closed took part in Tuesday's march. Similar 
but smaller protests were staged in other towns of northern 
Greece, like Drama, east of here, where mayor Maiyaritis Tsimas 
personally removed the name of Franklin Roosevelt Street. 
  "I have no idea of the size of the demonstration but many 
people braved an intense cold with great national fervour," 
Thessaloniki police chief Ioannis Karakondinis said. 
  Pandeleimon, a strong nationalist and religious 
fundamentalist, prayed at a religious ceremony for "God in his 
infinite wisdom to enlighten Clinton so that he changes his 
anti-Greek policy." 
  The ceremony was attended by the minister for the Greek 
provinces of Macedonia and Thrace, Kostas Triaridhis, who was 
present in a non-official capacity, and many politicians sent 
supportive messages, including government spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos, a member of parliament for Macedonia.

<F P=106> [Report by Nazlan Ertan] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--Turkey, which had firmly protested the 
European Union [EU] decision to appoint an observer to the 
Cyprus question, denied claims that it had changed its position 
of "not talking to the EU official." 
  "There is absolutely no change in our position. We will hold 
no official talks with the observer, as we believe that the EU's 
involvement in the Cyprus problem is uncalled-for and completely 
counterproductive," Foreign Ministry acting spokesman Ferhat 
Ataman told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. 
  Ataman's denial of any change in the Turkish position 
followed the arrival of Serge Abou, the EU-appointed observer to 
Ankara in the delegation of Leon Brittan, the EU Commission, 
came as part of the delegation and not as an observer. "His 
duty as observer has not yet started," diplomatic sources said. 
"Ankara has made it clear that the observer would not be welcome 
in Turkey." 
  The European Union, giving in to Greece's insistence on the 
appointment of an observer, has tried to appease Turkey by 
appointing a "middle-ranking Eurocrat" rather than a "star" like 
Leo Tindemans, the former Belgian foreign minister. Then the 
Union announced that the "observer" would only report 
developments and progress on the Cyprus question, rather than 
take part in the negotiations. 
  But these moves failed to calm Ankara which firmly believes 
that Greece, a direct party to the conflict, would at the same 
time become "the prosecutor, the judge and the accused" if the 
EU became involved in the conflict. 
  Ankara's dilemma, however, lay in the fact that Serge Abou, 
handpicked by the Commission with the hope of appeasing Turkey, 
is decidedly pro-Turkish and regarded in Ankara as "a friend and 
ally." Given these facts, it would have been awkward for Ankara 
to reject the EU's "subtle diplomacy" of bringing in "Abou as 
part of the delegation, particularly when he did not use the 
title of `Cyprus observer.'" 
  "(But) the identity and the inclinations of the observer are 
irrelevant. We reject the principle of the decision," a Turkish 
official said. 
  The same official stressed that Abou had come as part of the 
customs union delegation, rather than with the title of EU 
observer, and that his duty had not officially started yet. But 
the question of Cyprus was discussed during the official talks. 
"I am pleased to note that Turkey supports the 
confidence-building measures," Brittan announced in a joint 
press conference with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin.

  [Text] Ankara--Justice Minister Seyfi Oktay said that the 
number of criminals arrested and imprisoned for terrorist 
activities had reached 6,500, and predicted that it would reach 
10,000 very soon. 
  Oktay added that, before the time of the present coalition 
government, this figure had been between 800-900, and that now, 
according to the report from the Office of the Chief of Staff, 
22 terrorists were being arrested every day. 
  Oktay denied the rumors that prisoners in Diyarbakir state 
penitentiary would be moved to another prison. 
  He said that he was not at all satisfied with the conditions 
in Turkish prisons. 
  He also stressed that, since terrorists were imprisoned in 
the province where they were sentenced, the government should 
increase the capacity of penitentiaries in areas were terrorism 
was most intense, because transferring prisoners was both 
difficult and dangerous. 
  Meanwhile, chief prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor 
of the State Security Court, met in the Justice Ministry under 
the supervision of the justice minister to discuss the problems 
of prisons in which terrorists were kept, and ways of avoiding 
jail breaks, the ANATOLIA news agency reported. 
  The 36 chief prosecutors agreed that jail breaks had greatly 
disturbed the public, and that recent measures had reduced the 
number of incidents and allowed the guards some advance warning 
before a prisoner tried to escape. 
  They said that there were two laws waiting to be passed by 
the Grand National Assembly, and that once they were approved 
measures would be taken to prevent all jail breaks. 
  The chief prosecutors meet five times a year, and will 
continue to do so.

<F P=106> [By Yalcin Ozer from the "Commentary" column: "The Rise of </F>
Bosnia and of the Prosperity Party"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The fact that the Prosperity 
Party [PP] is becoming stronger and stronger is more apparent 
every day. Surveys show that the PP is either the first or 
second mass party in Turkey today. 
  The old political balances are disappearing in Turkey in 
1994. The wedding ceremony held at the Swiss Hotel yesterday was 
in a sense a metaphor for the True Path Party-Motherland Party 
[TPP-ANAP] wedding. President Demirel and ANAP leader Yilmaz 
were there together, symbolically announcing that there are no 
longer any differences between the two parties. 
  The present ANAP is not Ozal's ANAP. Instead, it is a 
"Demirelized" center party that is more like the TPP. The PP 
stands opposite these two intermingled parties. 
  What about the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP]? 
  This pretentious party of the past has abandoned most of its 
political claims and is now a mere fourth party. We are aware 
of it now because it is a coalition partner, but it is hard to 
believe that it will find any supporters other than a few 
marginal artists in the future. 
  At present, the total votes that can be collected by the 
rightist parties stands at 70 percent. The number of votes the 
leftist parties (if you still consider Bulent Ecevit the leader 
of a leftist party) can receive has gone down to 25 percent. 
  What do we see behind these figures? 
  While he was prime minister, Demirel had 129 corruption 
files 
prepared against the ANAP. He had the assembly approve some of 
them and had them sent to the Constitutional Court. The ANAP 
did not lag far behind. It sued the TPP for corruption as in 
the ILKSAN case. 
  The SDPP turned out to be more "productive" in corruption 
cases than the TPP or ANAP. Rumors of corruption and bribes in 
SDPP municipalities were rampant. The SDPP and the leftist 
parties in general lost votes as a result of these rumors. 
  This situation gave a rare trump card to the PP. Due to the 
moral crisis they were in, the three parties, which are not very 
different from each other, made the PP the favorite party. 
  Of course this is not the only reason why the PP is the 
favorite party today. In the new conditions, a reason which we 
can call a historically dialectic reason, has also played a 
role: The Bosnia-Herzegovina situation has deeply wounded the 
Turkish nation. The caring attitude of the PP toward this 
problem cannot even be compared to the attitude of the other 
parties. 
  Our center parties are not able to bring clear solutions to 
the problems Turkey faces. The winds of change in the world 
cannot go beyond the rigid central bureaucracies of these 
parties. 
  Faced with the PP's unbelievable rise, certain circles are 
trying to wage the struggle outside the democratic framework: 
they claim that the PP is getting aid from outside Turkey and 
that the prosecutor is investigating these charges. Such tricks 
also play a role in helping the PP rise to the top.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan by </F>
Marc Paoloni in Brussels; date not given: "Sir Leon Brittan 
Says `I Am Prepared To Succeed Jacques Delors'"] 
  [Paolini] This Tuesday [15 February], the Director General 
of the GATT received the final offers for the reduction of 
customs duties. Have you managed, since the conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round, to obtain the extra concessions you were seeking? 
  [Brittan] The date of 15 February did not simply mark the 
end 
of a technical stage: Each party had to officially make its 
offer by this date. We have used the last two months 
effectively to try to obtain more generous offers from certain 
of our partners, but we had no intention of reopening the 
negotiations held in the run-up to 15 December. The concessions 
made by all sides can still be improved until the very last 
moment, and that moment, as always in negotiations, has not yet 
arrived. I am nevertheless convinced that, in the long term, 
the European Union will obtain a result that will represent a 
real improvement over what was obtained on 15 December, 
especially in the area of textiles. 
  [Paolini] Who, up to now, has not made the effort you would 
have hoped for? 
  [Brittan] Japan. That country has already done a lot, we 
must admit it, but we have asked for a considerable extra effort 
in the sectors that concern a great many of our companies. 
However, it is true that to date we have not been very 
successful. 
  [Paolini] Experts have relativized these initial Japanese 
efforts saying that Tokyo is only bringing its official customs 
duties down to the levels actually applied in recent years.... 
  [Brittan] That is an exaggeration. However, as in all 
exaggerations, there is some truth. Indeed, the degree to which 
the Japanese market has opened up to date is not as significant 
as it might appear at first sight. 
  [Paolini] This is a sentiment that is shared by the American 
authorities since, this weekend, Tokyo refused to make any 
commitment on import levels. What do you think of this failure 
and the risks of a trade war that it carries? 
  [Brittan] I was not at all surprised by this failure. 
Neither 
do I favor the approach taken by the Americans, for two reasons. 
Firstly, I am convinced that this method would not have 
positive results. Secondly, if you believe in free trade and 
the market economy, you cannot go down the road to the carving 
up of markets. The Americans had, in a way, taken this path. 
  [Paolini] You must admit that it has served them quite well 
up to now, especially when you look at the results obtained by 
the Community over the last 10 years.... 
  [Brittan] For the reasons I have explained, I took a 
different approach. We set up a mechanism with the Japanese 
that lets us examine in detail the reasons for our trade 
deficits. This analysis should make it possible to take a fresh 
look at tariff obstacles, structural problems, and the lack of 
effort on the part of our own companies. Then, on this basis, 
we will try and define the measures we need to implement to 
remedy the situation. This analysis is almost complete, and I 
am fairly optimistic. I am not saying we will get immediate and 
concrete results in all areas, but I do think that come the 
spring we will have obtained more than the Americans. 
  [Paolini] You took a similar approach with the Americans to 
persuade them to open up their public markets. The next stage 
depends on the results of a study that you commissioned with 
Mickey Kantor on the true extent of liberalization on both sides 
of the Atlantic. How far have you gone with this? 
  [Brittan] We have had the results of the study for some time 
and now we have to digest its conclusions. We already concluded 
a partial agreement with the United States last year, and we 
will continue to negotiate on the basis of this study to try and 
obtain more. As in 1993, I am looking for a greater opening up 
of the American public markets while refusing any imbalance 
between the two sides. 
  [Paolini] Who is the more protectionist according to this 
study? 
  [Brittan] For the time being I will simply say that our 
concerns have been justified. 
  [Paolini] On 28 February you will be in Beijing to negotiate 
with another important trading partner. Exchange, cooperation, 
etc. are all on the agenda, but so is the issue of China's 
candidacy for GATT membership. Will you go armed with a 
proposal? 
  [Brittan] The decision has not yet been made, but the idea 
is 
still to open negotiations with this vast country -- the last 
one which does not have a market economy yet. Negotiations will 
be aimed at persuading China to accept the normal rules of 
international trade to which all the other GATT countries are 
subject. We must first have agreement on that basic point. 
Only then can we discuss the details and the measures that we 
and the Chinese are ready to accept. When I say "we" I mean the 
international community as a whole because, for example, the 
American position is not exactly the same as our own. Moreover, 
when I speak of "details," it must be clear that I do not mean 
unimportant matters. How could it be otherwise, when we are 
talking about child labor. However, that is as much as I am 
prepared to say for the time being. 
  [Paolini] Returning to GATT, can you describe any recent 
progress in other aspects of the Uruguay Round? 
  [Brittan] No, it is still much too early to say what the 
results are. For example, there are still two more years of 
discussions ahead of us on financial services and a little less 
than two years, I hope, for maritime transport and steel 
production. These are issues for which, to date, we have only 
established a general approach and which we must now conclude in 
detail. 
  [Paolini] Should we fear that the interest shown by 
Washington in the relationship between trade, the environment, 
and working standards is aimed at slowing down the creation of 
the World Trade Organization? 
  [Brittan] That is a baseless fear. Neither the United States 
nor any other country has set out preconditions for the creation 
of this organization. The international community is simply 
agreed that a working program should be set up to examine the 
links between trade and problems of the environment -- on this 
point and on this point alone. I do not think there will be 
discussions on these points when the agreement is signed in 
Marrakech. Your question reveals the impression the Americans 
could have given -- perhaps in some of the things President 
Clinton has said -- when they stressed firmly that the 
environment and working conditions must take priority in the 
next phase of negotiations. 
  [Paolini] If we now leave the international scene and turn 
to 
the European Union, the overriding concern is the seriousness of 
the unemployment situation. What do you say to those people who 
put the blame for this on the choices made at Maastricht? 
  [Brittan] The White Paper on Growth, Competition and 
Employment provided an in-depth and pertinent analysis of the 
factors of this crisis. One thing is clear: The cause of our 
problems does not lie in the fact that we have followed overly 
monetarist "Maastrichian" policies. The authors of the treaty 
did not consider strict monetarism to be more important than 
employment. Their analysis revealed that the precondition for a 
healthy economy is the reduction of budget deficits, and 
therefore this is a precondition to growth and job creation. It 
is not about choosing monetary orthodoxy at the expense of the 
real economy. I believe this analysis remains entirely 
justified. If we abandon it, it means we are prepared for more 
inflation. If we look at economic history we see that those 
countries that followed anti-inflationary policies obtained the 
best results. 
  [Paolini] That theory does not go down too well with the 
unemployed. Are you not afraid of a social explosion in Europe? 
  [Brittan] I am convinced the economic situation will 
improve. 
We are coming out of a recession. Not very quickly, it is 
true, but the signs should be clearer by spring. Having said 
that, the structural problems will remain. The white paper 
indicated the efforts the Twelve will have to make, both 
individually and collectively. The GATT negotiations showed us 
what the Twelve can achieve when they are united. We can tackle 
all the basic problems if we go about it in a realistic way and 
with long-term vision. As for the immediate risks of a social 
explosion, I cannot say they do not exist, but the situation 
varies from one member state to the next. If you think I am 
being rather optimistic, that's because I am can also see, 
parallel to the progressive improvement in the economy, the 
start of the implementation of concrete structural measures 
identified by the white paper. 
  [Paolini] At the European summit meeting to be held in Corfu 
in June, the Twelve will appoint a successor to Jacques Delors 
as president of the European Commission. Are you a candidate 
for the post? 
  [Brittan] I would not use the word "candidate" because that 
implies an electoral campaign. Quite frankly, it is not a 
question of candidacy or campaigning. The president of the 
European Commission is appointed by the heads of state and 
government. However, I have been a member of the Commission for 
five years now, and I have done many things there. If the heads 
of state and government decide I can continue my work as 
president, I would be very honored and am prepared to take on 
the task.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/125: "EU Funds Retraining of </F>
16,000 Russian Officers"] 
  [Text] A major conversion project gets under way today 
within the framework of the European Union's [EU] program of 
technical assistance to the New Independent States (TACIS). The 
project is valued at ECU12 million ($13.6 million) and over the 
next three years will retrain 16,000 officers of the Russian 
Army in various aspects of Western management and marketing. 
  Russian authorities officially requested assistance from the 
European Commission to retrain military personnel in mid-1992. 
According to figures presented to the Russian Government at the 
time, the number of officers to be discharged from the Armed 
Forces between 1992 and 1995 would number in the region of 
50,000 annually. This does not include a total of over 30,000 
men returning from Germany by 1994. 
  To help the officers adjust to civilian life, a 
comprehensive 
training project was developed following detailed consultations 
with the Russian recipients. The principal aim of the project 
is to upgrade the qualifications of teachers who will work in 15 
training centers established in various regions. Four hundred 
teachers will receive training in general management and 
marketing, including principles of the market economy and modern 
teaching methods. Of these, half will undergo additional 
training in more specialized areas such as management as it is 
applied to small and medium enterprises. 
  One of the most important aspects of the training is that 
the 
teachers should become self-sufficient in the development of 
curricula to suit the needs of the local economies. Thirty-two 
teachers will specialize in this field, while a similar number 
will be trained as employment counselors. 
  The intention is that by the time the project nears 
completion, the training centers will be able to retrain the 
16,000 officers targeted by the projects. They should also be 
able to provide training in areas which meet the developing 
manpower needs existing in any particular region. 
  Russian bodies involved in the project include the state 
committee of higher education and the Defense Ministry. The 
consortium of European companies chosen to implement the project 
is led by Elea-Olivetti, the Italian company's training branch, 
and includes other firms from various EU countries, such as GOPA 
[Company for Organization, Planning, and Education] for 
(Germany), ISVOR (Italy) and SODETEG [Company of Technical 
Studies and General Operations] (France).

Serbs -- Denied By High Commission's Office"; as released by

  [Text] Geneva, 10 Feb (ATS/AFP) -- The UN High Commission 
for Refugees (UNHCR) denied on Thursday [10 February] in Geneva 
that its officials in Bosnia had been prevented from leaving the 
area by Serbian troops. In the morning, the Bosnian Serbs' press 
officer had stated in Pale that the UNHCR officials were no 
longer authorized to leave the Serbian-held part of Bosnia. 
  UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond stated: "We saw nothing 
resembling a hostage-taking situation." He added that UNHCR 
officials had been able to return to Belgrade from Zeppa, in 
northeast Bosnia, on Thursday. UNHCR officials in Geneva 
specified that UNHCR had not instructed its staff to leave the 
Serbian area of Bosnia, as opposed to rumors. 
  On Thursday, three Banja Luka-based HCR officials wanting to 
leave for Zagreb had been stopped by Serbian forces, who had 
prevented them from passing because they had not received 
notification of their departure 48 hours in advance. UNHCR 
added that this kind of official harassment was not unusual.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Martin S. Lambeck; </F>
place and date not given: "A Disgrace for Social Democracy"] 
  [Text] [Lambeck] Mr. Chancellor, next week the IG-Metall 
trade union will decide in a strike ballot on whether or not to 
go on strike. Do you still see a chance of preventing a strike 
at this unfortunate time? 
  [Kohl] I will not interfere in the wage negotiations. I am 
a convinced supporter of autonomy in collective bargaining. 
However, I think of the 4 million unemployed and of the urgent 
need to ensure with all our strength a climate that is 
beneficial for investment so that further job losses can be 
stopped. Therefore, I would welcome it very much if every 
opportunity were used, right up to the last minute, to reach 
agreement. I refer to the example of the agreement in the 
chemical industry. That was a sensible agreement. 
  [Lambeck] What should a sensible agreement in the public 
sector be like? 
  [Kohl] In the public sector I am in a different situation 
than regarding the aforementioned wage negotiations. As 
chancellor I represent one third of the partners in the wage 
negotiations, in this case the employers. I do not want to give 
you any figures here now. However, the following principles 
apply: 
  1. Everyone, including the trade unions, know the situation 
with regard to public budgets. 
  2. We all know -- perhaps now more than in the past -- how 
important a secure job is. A job in the public sector is a 
secure job. This is an important asset; and, I think, this must 
also be taken into consideration. I myself have already pointed 
out that the budget situation does not permit any increases in 
the public sector. We should think of the social situation of 
the affected individuals. I would imagine that we would offer a 
different settlement for the lower wage groups than for those 
who get higher salaries. 
  [Lambeck] The latest mediation procedure involving the 
nursing-care insurance once again threatens to fail. Do you see 
any chance of a compromise at the last moment? 
  [Kohl] I am in favor of trying up to the last moment to get 
nursing-care insurance through parliament and to reach a 
positive agreement. In a few years we will have more than 3 
million people over 80. This demographic development shows that 
the number of senior citizens is increasing considerably. The 
decision is overdue. I myself do not understand the entire 
controversy at all. And I believe that millions of our 
fellow-citizens do not understand it, either. 
  What is the problem? Everyone agrees that nursing-care 
insurance is necessary, the only differences of opinion are 
about compensation. In Germany an employee has an average 
annual leave of 30 working days. In addition, there are 12 to 
14 public holidays. Added up, this is eight weeks of annual 
leave and free time. The point is whether we are ready to give 
up two holidays in such a way that the holidays remain but are 
not paid. In a country that has the longest vacations in the 
world I find it absurd that we are still quarreling. 
  [Lambeck] There have been discussions about the contacts of 
the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and the Bonn coalition with 
the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] leadership. The SPD 
now speaks of mudslinging. Is the past here being turned into 
an election issue. 
  [Kohl] The SPD always speaks of mudslinging as soon as 
things get unpleasant for them. What is the real issue? The 
real issue is not the Stasi files. The facts are being 
distorted deliberately. First, the point is that after the 
construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 all laender together 
established the recording office in Salzgitter. The purpose of 
this documentation office was to record the barbaric human 
rights violations committed against German citizens in the GDR. 
This small office had a great psychological effect in the 
former GDR. I know from former prisoners, who were in Bautzen 
or in other prisons in the former GDR, that many people 
cherished the hope that the evil deeds of the henchmen there 
would not go unpunished in the long run. After all, it was no 
coincidence that in his Gera Demands Honecker demanded that this 
office be abolished. He made this demand at every occasion, 
also when he talked to me. I think it is a disgrace that the 
SPD-governed laender canceled their subsidies to the 
documentation center. They did it just to do Mr. Honecker a 
favor. This has nothing to do with Stasi files or with 
mudslinging. It is a disgrace for the great, traditional German 
social democracy, which has otherwise advocated human rights. 
Advocating human rights in Guatemala is one thing, but 
advocating human rights for fellow German citizens in the GDR is 
something quite different. And when Mr. Rau now calls himself 
the presidential candidate of all Germans, he must explain to 
the 17 million Germans in the former GDR why he stopped 
financing this documentation office in 1988 when he was minister 
president of North Rhine-Westphalia. 
  The other big demand of the SED [Socialist Unity party of 
Germany] leadership under Honecker referred to the recognition 
of an independent GDR citizenship. Once again one does not need 
the Stasi files to prove that the majority of the SPD leadership 
wanted to meet this demand had they won the Bundestag elections 
in 1987. This would have had disastrous consequences for the 
refugees from the GDR in Hungary and in Prague in 1989. I do 
not intend to permit the SPD to tell me what to say. 
  [Lambeck] Let us turn from the problems in Germany to the 
situation in the Balkans: The NATO ultimatum to the Serbs has 
made the situation around Sarajevo relatively calm. Now the 
bloody war is raging in other Bosnian regions instead. Does the 
credibility of the United Nations and NATO continue to suffer 
because of that? 
  [Kohl] All those who talk about credibility have not found a 
panacea, either. I am very, very happy that the common NATO 
decision exists. I am also very happy that President Clinton 
has now accepted a certain leadership role for the United 
States. I myself have emphatically advised him to do so. 
  I also think that we have to make every effort to integrate 
Russia and Boris Yeltsin in this decision. I myself have 
discussed the matter with Yeltsin several times. Now there is 
once again an opportunity to put an end to this horrendous war 
in the Balkans and, above all, to the terrible suffering of the 
people. 
  [Lambeck] Will the Bundeswehr provide logistical support in 
the event of NATO air strikes in Bosnia, if the allies ask you? 
  [Kohl] For well-known reasons, the Bundeswehr itself cannot 
provide any troops for operations in the former Yugoslavia. If 
it is necessary to provide logistical support outside the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia and if we are asked to do so, 
I am strongly in favor of it. 
  [Lambeck] Russia has serious reservations about NATO air 
strikes on Serbian positions. Now it is known that you, Mr. 
Chancellor, have a particularly close and good relationship with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Are you mediating between the 
United States and Russia regarding the issue of Bosnia? 
  [Kohl] We Germans cannot presume to have a mediating role in 
this connection. I have excellent personal and friendly 
relations with both Yeltsin and Clinton. I try to be helpful 
within the framework of my capabilities.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Joe Clark, the UN secretary </F>
general's special representative in Cyprus, by unidentified 
Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent; place and date 
not given -- Clark speaks in English] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Announcer] Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, believes 
that both President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas will attend the talks with goodwill. 
  [Clark] I believe there is goodwill on both sides. Obviously 
there are going to be questions, obviously people come at this 
from different perspectives, but I think there is recognition 
that the international community has been working hard to help 
the people of Cyprus come to an agreement on these measures. 
  The other thing that, of course, is clear is that this is 
not 
at all the end of the process. We have to build confidence in 
order to get on to deal with some of the basic questions that 
have divided the island. And I don't regard the 
confidence-building measures as being an end unto themselves, 
but I certainly do regard them as being an important key to the 
door that will let us deal with the more basic questions. 
  [Announcer] Asked what one could expect in the best 
scenario, 
Clark said he hopes the UN secretary will be able to state in 
his report to the UN Security Council that there has been 
progress. It would be ideal, he added, if he could mention that 
an agreement has been reached to implement the measures. But, 
it would be unrealistic to expect this to happen in nine or ten 
days. 
  [Clark] Certainly, however, I think its going to be 
critically important that there be agreement on the way we give 
effect to these measures and that we start giving the effect, I 
would hope by at least the end of March. That means we have to 
make real progress in the next couple of days. 
  [Announcer] How and why is Joe Clark optimistic? 
  [Clark] I am certainly more optimistic now than I was two or 
three weeks ago because there has been important movement, I 
think on two issues. One, a clear statement of principle in 
support of the proposal by each side and, secondly, an agreement 
on the way we should proceed. Now, we have to get down to the 
details as to what we do to give effect to these measures and if 
we agree on that, as I think it is possible we can, we then get 
on to the more basic question.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by </F>
Sebahattin Onkibar in Ankara on 11 February, from the "Politics 
Diary" column] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin visited our paper's 
Ankara office yesterday, and we had lunch together. This is how 
Cetin summed up the latest situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
issue: "The present stage has finally been reached at a bitter 
price and 200,000 deaths. The present stage is close, even if 
not completely the same, to what Turkey has been vociferously 
proposing for the last two years. All the formalistic 
initiatives by the West over the last two years have produced no 
results and it eventually adopted our thesis. To say it openly, 
the latest NATO decision falls short of our expectations, but 
still it is of some importance." 
  I asked our foreign minister, whose wholehearted efforts on 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue we have always applauded, if the 
latest NATO decision is a farce. 
  Cetin replied: "No, it is not, it cannot be. If such a 
thing happens, let me state openly that NATO will lose all its 
credibility and reliability. NATO, which enjoys respect, will 
find itself in a difficult situation in such a case." 
  After taking a deep breath, Cetin added: "Now look, the 
issue here is definitely one of Christian fundamentalism. This 
is basically why people have turned a blind eye to this problem 
for so long. Had the West assumed its present position from the 
very start vis-a-vis the Serbian leaders, who want to set up a 
Great Serbian state, all these massacres would not have 
happened." 
  We asked the foreign minister how the opposition by Britain, 
Canada, and Greece against intervention was overcome. He 
replied: 
  "Turkey exerted enormous efforts in this direction. The 
extraordinary session was convened at our invitation. In 
addition, it must be noted that the NATO secretary general also 
made intensive efforts. During the latest meeting, Britain did 
not put up too much resistance and we managed to overcome the 
objections from Canada and Greece. They had no pretext left in 
the name of humanity to put up resistance." 
  Here we immediately asked what Turkey's position would be on 
a possible intervention. Could Turkey be the leading force in 
such an intervention? 
  Cetin said: "Could be. Our 16 F-16 planes are waiting in 
Italy. If need be we could increase this force. If NATO asks, 
we are ready to undergo any sacrifice to fulfill our historic 
responsibilities. We are hereby informing the public through 
you: All our preparations in this regard have been completed. 
We informed the UN of this in writing." 
  The foreign minister also provided information on the 
developments that might lead to intervention. He said: "Now 
there are ten very critical days before us. If, during this ten 
days, the Serbs do not announce to the world that they have 
stopped the massacres and pulled back their arms and militia as 
demanded, then inevitably an intervention, that is, air 
operations, will take place." 
  It is our greatest wish to see the implementation of these 
declarations, which please us, albeit a bit too late. This 
century's drama, which once again brought to our attention the 
other unseen side of the West, that is, its ugly face, is a 
great lesson for us. 
  We must give the Turkish Foreign Ministry and its leader 
Hikmet Cetin the due they deserve. We can say without 
exaggeration that, even if late, this point has been reached 
thanks to the persistent efforts by the esteemed Mr. Cetin and 
our Foreign Ministry. Valuable points have been added to the 
personal record of Cetin. Even the opposition says that "he is 
one minister with whom we have established the best of 
dialogue." To state it openly, the solidarity between [Prime 
Minister] Ciller, [Deputy Prime Minister] Karayalcin, and the 
opposition on this issue deserves every praise. Neither should 
one forget President Suleyman Demirel. We can state without 
exaggeration that Turkey has done everything it could given the 
current international situation. 
<H5>  Aliyev's Visit and Armenia </H5>
  Taking advantage of the opportunity, we also asked Foreign 
Minister Cetin about the latest situation on Armenian 
aggression. He said: "We have declared over and over again: 
The Armenians must immediately withdraw from the territories 
they have occupied. Either they will have to withdraw on their 
own, or they will be made to withdraw; yes, they will be made to 
withdraw." 
  Is this sentence "they will be made to withdraw" not 
interesting, coming from Cetin, who is known to the public as a 
person who keeps his opinions to himself and speaks in 
diplomatic language? 
  We immediately asked who would force the Armenians out. 
Would 
it be Turkey? 
  Cetin hesitated to reply. It was obvious that he was having 
trouble spelling out certain views. He said: "Let me say this 
much: Azerbaijan and Turkey are one nation. They have the same 
ethnic roots. Therefore, Turkey will do all it can." 
  What, for example? Will it send troops? Will it provide 
arms? 
  At this point I asked him if logistical support was promised 
to the Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who is still in 
Turkey. 
  Cetin merely replied: "No comment." 
  It is clear what this means. Certainly, specific meanings 
could be drawn when a foreign minister, who knows the 
international law well, is not saying "no there is no such 
support," and instead says "no comment." 
  Yes, with the changes in the international situation, a 
tremendous dynamism is seen in the Foreign Ministry, which we 
have been often criticizing only recently. And, Cetin's star is 
shining to the maximum. And, no one should be uneasy at this. 
After all, our foreign policy is above parties, that is, it is 
national in character. 
  We advise Cetin to "keep" to his present course.

  [Text] The Hague, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Nelson Mandela, the ANC 
chairman, and Yasir 'Arafat, leader of the PLO, held an 
hour-long meeting here Friday morning [18 February], officials 
said. 
  Talks centred on a proposed visit by Mandela to Israel, 
according to a Dutch committee for the support of the democratic 
process in South Africa, quoting African National Congress (ANC) 
officials in Johannesburg. 
  Such a visit, however, would only take place once a peace 
accord was concluded between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO), the committee said. 
  The talks took place at the official residence here of Prime 
Minister Ruud Lubbers. 
  Following the meeting, 'Arafat was to hold talks with 
Lubbers 
and deputy economic minister responsible for foreign trade 
Yvonne van Rooij on Dutch aid to the future autonomous 
Palestinian territories. 
  Mandela, for his part, was to meet with the premier of the 
German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Johannes Rau, to discuss 
German aid to South Africa before holding talks with Dutch 
deputies and businessmen.

  [Text] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes and Hans van 
den Broek, European Community commissioner on foreign affairs, 
appeared extremely reserved about the measures the Greek 
Government has taken on Skopje. Claes and van den Broek arrived 
in Athens a short time ago together with German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev to 
attend tomorrow's meeting between the European troika and Russia. 
  Claes said he does not hide his concern and will continue to 
insist that the Athens-Skopje dialogue resume at the United 
Nations, something, as he put it, that everybody in Europe 
considers as the best way to safeguard the good neighborliness 
between the two countries and, primarily, something that ensures 
the smooth functioning of the European Union as a whole and 
toward its neighbors. 
  Van den Broek said he will seek clarification on the 
measures 
from the Greek Government and will also examine their 
compatibility with the legal framework of the European Union. 
  Their disagreement over the Bosnian issue is clear. Kozyrev 
expressed his clear opposition to the NATO threat of bombings 
and implied that any bombing would also affect Russia's 
participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace plan concerning 
the accession of Eastern countries. Kozyrev left open the 
possibility of Russian blue helmet [United Nations] troops going 
to Sarajevo to safeguard peace as early as the weekend. 
  Claes and van den Broek expressed their optimism that 
bombings will be averted but also stated the conviction that the 
strict NATO ultimatum was decoded correctly and both Europe and 
the Atlantic Alliance should insist on it.

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The prospect of air strikes on Serb positions around 
Sarajevo now seemed more remote thanks to Russia, Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd said tonight. 
  An immediate threat of a breakdown in the ceasefire 
retreated 
when the leader of the Bosnian Serbs said his forces would 
withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo after Russia pledged 
to provide 400 peacekeeping troops in the area. 
  NATO has threatened air strikes against any artillery or 
heavy weapons around the Bosnian capital unless they are 
withdrawn at least 12 miles from the city or surrendered to the 
United Nations by midnight on Sunday [20 February]. 
  Mr. Hurd said of the Russian move: "This fits in admirably 
with the NATO initiative. They sit well together and if this 
works on the ground, there is now a much better chance than 
before of avoiding air strikes because the heavy weapons will 
have been withdrawn or controlled." 
  He told reporters in London: "If things turn out right on 
the 
ground, there will be a huge advance...but of course what counts 
is what happens not what is said." 
  If there were "no significant shelling" by the time the 
deadline lapses on Sunday and the heavy weapons had been 
withdrawn or put under control, there would be "no need for air 
strikes." 
  But he warned that the air strikes would go ahead if the UN 
terms were not met. 
  He said: "There is now a real prospect of a nightmare coming 
to an end." 
  Asked if the war in Sarajevo was about to end, he said: 
"There is a chance because of the NATO initiative, because of 
the way the troop contributors, including Britain, have 
responded and now because of the way the Russians have brought 
themselves back into the peace protest [as received] -- there is 
a chance of that." 
  Mr. Hurd said he and the Prime Minister had been told during 
their trip to Russia this week that Moscow was willing to put in 
troops under the United Nations. 
  Mr. Hurd, speaking outside his official residence in Carlton 
Gardens, said he and the Prime Minister had "spent hours" 
discussing the possibility of the Russians putting in troops 
when they met Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his ministers 
earlier this week. 
  He had spoken to the American Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and the French, German and Italian foreign ministers 
today by telephone about the importance of getting the Russians 
back into the peace process. 
  "I think they felt a bit left out in the last two or three 
weeks. But I hope that is put right now," he said. 
  "Russia is very much part of the answer to the Bosnian 
crisis. When the Prime Minister and I were in Moscow we urged 
the Russians to do all they could to get the Serbs into the 
right action and I'm delighted they've done so apparently to 
good effect," he said.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Many of the contracting 
parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
have expressed concern at what they say is the contradictory 
"unilateralism" in U.S. trade policy, a GATT report disclosed 
here Thursday [17 February]. 
  The document, drafted during meetings to examine to U.S. 
trade pratices, emerged as Washington was threatening Japan with 
severe reprisals if Tokyo failed to open its markets to 
U.S.-made portable telephones. 
  The United States has warned that it will prepare a list of 
Japanese products on which U.S. duties will be increased if 
Tokyo does not come forward with plans to give foreign portable 
telephone manufacturers greater access to Japanese consumers. 
  Washington contends that Japan is violating a 1989 accord on 
such equipment. 
  But the GATT report found that many parties to the agreement 
see U.S. trade policy as "unilataralist" and contradictory. 
  "They point to what they consider the contradictions 
inherent 
in laws aimed at opening markets based on threats to close 
markets." 
  They cited in particular U.S. legislation known as "Section 
301." 
  "There is a growing number of complaints from trading 
partners concerning the increased resort to these laws and the 
methods used to determine dumping, subsidization and injury," 
the report said. 
  It noted that while the United States over the past two 
years 
has made "relatively restrained use of these laws," it has 
nonetheless "introduced new procedures to maintain pressure on 
foreign governments." 
  The study criticized those voices in the United States 
urging 
greater protection against "high-savings countries with which 
the bilateral deficits are greatest" -- notably Japan. 
  It said that "pressure to take bilateral action against 
these 
partners threatens both the openness of the U.S. trade regime 
and the multilateral system." 
  GATT found that the United States does not always apply the 
lofty principles of free trade that it defends in debates with 
its principal partners. While the United States maintains 
restrictive legislation to protect its own producers it 
pressures other countries to open their markets still wider, 
according to GATT.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 17 (AFP) -- The European Community 
criticised U.S. attempts to force open the Japanese market here 
Thursday [17 February], and proposed a joint approach with 
Washington and Tokyo to overcome Japan's barriers to foreign 
imports. 
  EC Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the Community did 
not 
support the U.S. strategy to negotiate sectoral market shares 
with Japan because "there seems to be an element of managed 
trade in it." He was speaking at a press conference to launch a 
major export promotion campaign aimed at helping small and 
medium-sized European firms get a foothold on the Japanese 
market. 
  The United States and Japan have been brought to the brink 
of 
a trade war because of Japanese refusal to accept numerical 
targets for increasing imports of American products. Brittan 
said the EC was nervous about the U.S. "numerical target" 
approach because American gains in Japanese market share could 
be at European expense. 
  The EC, by contrast, is trying to make European goods more 
attractive to Japanese consumers, while at the same time trying 
to make Japan dismantle general barriers to foreign imports such 
as tax laws and cartels. Brittan suggested that the EC and the 
U.S. might work together in a "trilateral approach" with Tokyo 
to push exports to Japan and at the same time create an economic 
environment which would encourage Japanese consumer demand. But 
he stressed that the idea was still in its infancy, and not yet 
a firm proposal. 
  Announcing the "Gateway to Japan" initiative, Brittan said: 
"We are pushing open the door to Japan.... We look to European 
businessmen to march through that gateway into the Japanese 
market." Penetrating the Japanese market might be difficult, he 
said, but was possible if the Europeans produced quality, 
properly-promoted products at the right price. 
  The Commission said the "Gateway to Japan" programme would 
include workshops throughout the EC for medium-sized companies 
interested in testing the Japanese market, plus trade missions 
and displays in Japan. It is to concentrate during a kick-off 
1994-95 phase on support for companies in the medical equipment 
and handling, mechanical handling, machine tools and furniture 
sectors. 
  The programme is to be extended in 1995-96 to other fields, 
possibly including such sectors as marine equipment, 
construction materials and equipment, waste management 
technologies and packaging machinery. The Commission said these 
were sectors where European firms were particularly competitive, 
although underrepresented on the Japanese market. 
  Brittan said the European Commission would finance the 
three-year campaign to the tune of ECU7.1 million (7.8 million 
dollars). It will be run by the Association of European 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Euro-Chamber). The EC's 
trade deficit with Japan was 31 billion dollars in 1992 and 26 
billion dollars in 1993. 
  Brittan said EC sales to Japan between 1986 and 1992 had 
increased 78 percent faster than its world-wide exports, but 
that this trade had fallen off over the last two years. 
  Euro-Chamber president Thomas MacPherson said: "This is a 
very major project. The message is that selling in Japan is not 
impossible. It can be profitable." 
  The Commission also announced it was extending another 
annual 
scheme to boost EC-Japan trade -- by teaching Japanese to about 
50 young European executives, then placing them in Japanese 
firms for six months.

<F P=106> [U.D. Jonker and R. Winkel report on interview with Carlos </F>
Westendorp, Spanish secretary of state for european affairs, in 
Brussels; date not given: "Spain Is Not Rejecting EC 
Enlargement Altogether"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- By enlarging the European Community to 
include the three Scandinavian countries and the alpine Republic 
of Austria, the political focus of the Community will be shifted 
to the north. For Spain, which managed to wrest itself out of 
lengthy political and geographical isolation on the basis of its 
EC membership, this is not an attractive prospect. 
Consequently, Spain certainly wants to be seen as the driving 
force behind a discreet front comprising EC member states that 
are endeavoring to slow down the accession of new member states 
by making their entry to the Community subject to the 
fulfillment of absurdly harsh preconditions. 
  Nothing could be further from the truth, contends Carlos 
Westendorp, Spanish secretary of state for european affairs -- 
every inch a Spaniard despite his Netherlands grandfather -- in 
the third of a series of interviews on Europe and the 
enlargement of the Community. "The EC is becoming a community 
of blond, blue-eyed people. All along we have resigned 
ourselves to this. If we still want to remain part of it, then 
we shall have to bleach our hair and start wearing blue contact 
lenses. And above all quit our bad economic habits." 
  "We are a satisfied power," says Westendorp, with a broad 
grin, when asked about the manna that will fall over Spain from 
heaven if the rich Scandinavian countries become member states 
of the EC. Unlike Spain and Portugal, which joined the Community 
in 1986, the new member states will consolidate the core of 
so-called net paying member states in the EC. However, their 
contribution will not be at all sufficient -- merely somewhere 
in the region of ECU1 or ECU2 billion, according to Westendorp. 
  The real negotiations on contributions to the Community 
budget, on the one hand, and receipts in the form of 
agricultural and regional subsidies, on the other, have not yet 
begun. In the Council of Ministers, Westendorp is playing a 
ruthless game, as diplomats and politicians from member states 
which are more inclined to embrace enlargement assure us. 
Enlargement? OK, but not over Spain's dead body. If some 
Arctic regions are fighting to overcome their own structural 
problems, then their struggle should be financed out of other 
people's pockets. 
  As Westendorp puts it: "We are playing an honest game. In 
order to qualify as a less well-developed region, per capita GDP 
must be less than 75 percent of the EC-wide average. In the 
province of Teruel that is indeed the case, but unfortunately 
the average for the region as a whole is 80 percent, so we 
receive no EC support. We are merely asking that the same 
criteria be applied in the far north." According to the Spanish 
negotiator, the problems concerning the financing of agriculture 
and regional policy are insoluble. He has more doubts where 
fish are concerned. Spanish fishermen have an eye on certain 
rich Norwegian fishing grounds that they had to leave in the 
1970's, but the Norwegians have so far failed to budge one 
centimeter. "We are asking for 7,000 tonnes of cod. If the 
Norwegians continue to insist that they cannot part with even 
one fish, then we will run up against serious problems." 
  The institutional reservations that Westendorp has attached 
to the result of the negotiations on behalf of his government 
seem much graver still. The Spanish Government does not want 
the new member states to be counted when the member states look 
in 1996 to see whether a majority of EC countries is in 
sufficiently good economic condition to proceed with the third 
phase of Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]. 
  A second hiccup concerns decisionmaking within the Council 
of 
Ministers. At present, 23 votes are required in order to block 
a decision. Between them, either two large and one small member 
state, or one large and three small member states, or even five 
small member states can come up with this number of votes. 
Spain is recommending that the blocking majority be raised to 
27 votes if a number of small countries joins together, but 
wants to stick to 23 if this number of votes is attained by a 
combination of only three countries. In practice, this 
constitutes an elegant way of boosting the relative clout of the 
larger member states within the Council of Ministers. 
  Westendorp explains: "The 23 votes usually represent 
something like 115 million people. You cannot make decisions 
that go against the wishes of one-third of the EC's population. 
The lower number of inhabitants in the candidate member states 
would mean that in some cases the 27 votes would represent the 
wishes of no more than 40 million citizens of Europe." 
  In its attempts to gain acceptance for such an approach, 
Spain proposed -- in vain -- that the influence of the 
Netherlands within the Council of Ministers be increased, 
reveals Westendorp. "With 15 million inhabitants, the 
Netherlands is not getting its dues with just five votes. It is 
a question of democratic legitimacy; we are all equal, but some 
are more equal than others." 
  For Spain, this constitutes one potential reason to take a 
rain check on the accession of the candidate member states, and 
the fisheries problem constitutes another. However, Westendorp 
let it be known that the situation is different regarding the 
demand that the new member states be excluded from the decision 
on whether or not to proceed with EMU in 1997. "We have tabled 
that proposition, and expect a certain degree of understanding 
from our partners. However, it is not some kind of breaking 
point." 
  However, Spain is by no means ruling out the possibility of 
the hard core (France, Germany, and the Benelux countries -- HET 
FINANCIEELE DAGBLAD editor's note) -- possibly with the addition 
of Denmark and Ireland -- daring to take the step toward a 
single currency in 1997, after all. Under the terms of the 
Treaty of Maastricht, a majority of the member states must 
fulfill the criteria regarding inflation, budgetary deficits, 
and exchange rate stability. And that is where the shoe 
pinches. The new member states will above all push down the 
average rate of inflation, thereby increasing the gap for 
existing member states like Italy and Spain, which will most 
certainly not succeed in coming up to the new mark. "We, too, 
want to make the leap in 1997," says Westendorp: "We are also 
capable of doing so." Westendorp continues by saying that there 
was no mention of the role of the new member states when the 
criteria for Maastricht were laid down. 
  Westendorp is pessimistic regarding the possibility of, say, 
seeing the approval of the treaties of accession go hand in hand 
with that of modifications to the Maastricht Treaty, a course 
which the European Parliament (including future member Piet 
Dankert, who is currently still a secretary of state in The 
Hague -- HET FINANCIEELE DAGBLAD editor's note) now appears to 
be steering. "We have always been in favor of giving the 
European Parliament more extensive rights, but I think that many 
member states have no sympathy for this idea at present." For 
his taste, even the agreement to meet again at government level 
in 1996 in order to review the treaty is too much to ask. "That 
date is too close, unless the economy makes a spectacular 
recovery, and the whole climate in Europe changes." 
  Westendorp still has an unpleasant aftertaste following the 
difficulties surrounding ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. 
"We will only make progress if we turn the thing around. There 
should be no more negotiations between technocrats, followed by 
the submission of proposals to the European Council in fearful 
trepidation of referenda in certain member states. We must go 
straight to drawing up a European constitution, and then put it 
to the European Parliament and the national Parliaments." 
  If no constitutional foundation is laid, says Westendorp, 
then within a few years the EC could become unmanageable. "We 
cannot stop enlargement at Malta and Cyprus; we must also admit 
the new democracies in Central and East Europe. That will be 
unworkable if no far-reaching reforms are implemented." 
  He sees a hard core emerging, which will make further 
progress on defense, foreign policy, and the fight against 
crime. Cooperation in these areas, formally included within the 
scope of the European Union, must then be integrated into the EC 
proper. Outside this core of states, there will then arise a 
number of countries in favor of a looser form of primarily 
economic cooperation. British (and German -- HET FINANCIEELE 
DAGBLAD editor's note) involvement in EMU will constitute a test 
case. 
  Westendorp claims that the Greek-Netherlands desire to 
entrust these institutional questions to a committee of wise men 
is not acceptable to everybody. "Nobody is wiser than the 
governments. We should set a group of intelligent government 
representatives to work with a view to preparing the 1996 
conference. Complemented by one representative from the 
European Parliament, and one or two independent experts, this 
would strongly resemble the Delors Committee which set the EMU 
ball rolling back in 1988." 
  There is one thing with which this group should not meddle 
at 
all, says Westendorp. Spain is no longer ready to contemplate 
making do with just one member in the European Commission. 
"Having 17 commissioners means that, together, the five larger 
countries have 10 votes, i.e., a majority. If there were 20 
commissioners this would no longer be the case. We certainly 
cannot put up with this any longer. In addition, if each member 
state had just one commissioner, then the European Commission 
would be a purely intergovernmental affair, like the meetings of 
national ambassadors." 
  Westendorp finds it "interesting" that British Commissioner 
Sir Leon Brittan is currently publicly touting himself as a 
candidate to succeed Commission President Jacques Delors. 
However, he believes that the Briton has no chance against Ruud 
Lubbers. "There is a consensus about Lubbers. He comes from 
the circle of heads of government, and is therefore a logical 
choice. Mr. Brittan will only be able to offer him his hand as 
a good loser."

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Smit: "Europol To Stretch Arm of the Law </F>
Over Borders"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- A prototype European Community police 
force was launched yesterday, with officers from the 12 member 
states making no secret of their ambition eventually to enforce 
the law across the EC, ignoring borders. 
  In a sleek building formerly occupied by the Dutch secret 
service in The Hague, the first chief of Europol, Herr Jurgen 
Storbeck, said he hoped to move rapidly beyond mere surveillance 
of drug traffickers. 
  Task forces or even multinational police squads should be 
set 
up, he said -- a scheme long demanded by Chancellor Kohl of 
Germany, but which causes shudders in London and some other 
European capitals. 
  "I think governments will agree to this federal ideal. What 
was unthinkable 10 years ago has now become thinkable," said 
Herr Storbeck, former German head of Interpol in Wiesbaden. 
  For now, British Tory nightmares of multilingual officers 
roaming the continent are some way from reality. 
  Yesterday, as a inaugural ceremony was held, intelligence 
officers sat at computer monitors, checking the cross-border 
activities of drugs smugglers. More direct action against crime 
will have to wait until October, while EC countries wrangle over 
the legal convention establishing the force under the Maastricht 
Treaty. 
  Herr Storbeck said the agency could gather detailed 
information on the movements and criminal records of citizens 
around Europe in less than three hours. 
  Since mid-January, 19 "liaison officers" representing the 12 
EC member states, including two Britons, have handled about 20 
cases, supplying relevant data gathered from their national 
police services. 
  This is only the first step towards the planned creation of 
Europe-wide databanks on crime and terrorism. 
  However, there could be stumbling blocks ahead over privacy 
rules and a lack of trust between national intelligence services. 
  "The national services have an obligation to provide us with 
information, but we don't have any powers to force them if they 
are reluctant," said Herr Storbeck.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Minister Wants More Powers for </F>
Europol"] 
  [Text] Europol, the European Community's joint police 
organization, should in the future carry out executive tasks to 
support the member states in the fight against organized crime, 
Justice Minister Hirsch Ballin said on Wednesday [16 February] 
at the opening of the Europol building on the Raamweg in The 
Hague. 
  The formation of joint detective teams on the basis of 
agreements between the member states "followed logically" from 
his proposal, the minister said. It would quickly become clear 
that Europol should not be limited to supporting the fight 
against drug dealing and money laundering, the minister said. 
"After all, organized crime does not limit itself to these 
activities," he said. "The organizations are always looking for 
more fields for their activities." 
  A rapid study of how Europol's duties should be expanded was 
therefore to be recommended, Hirsch Ballin said. The agreements 
between the 12 member states only allow Europol to exchange 
information. The minister said that Europol's powers would also 
have to be expanded, so that the organization was given 
executive powers. "I realize that this last step is still far 
away, but it is the direction we must follow," Hirsch Ballin 
said.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 16 (AFP) -- European Community steel 
industry grouping Eurofer said Wednesday afternoon [16 February] 
that it might appeal to the European Court of Justice against 
the EC Commission's decision to fine steel companies for cartel 
activity. 
  It said the companies involved were studying the decision, 
and would indicate their reaction. 
  Eurofer did not officially react to a statement by Van Miert 
that the organization had set up a working group to coordinate 
the activities of the alleged cartel. 
  In London, British steel, which was hit with the biggest 
fine 
among the 16 EC steelmakers fined a total of ECU104 million (115 
million dollars) by the Commission, said it would probably 
appeal to the European Court of Justice, but was waiting to 
receive official notification. 
  Keith Brookman, general secretary of the Iron and Steel 
Trades Confederation, the main British union in the sector, said 
he was "shocked and horrified" by the decision. The union 
totally supports British Steel on the matter and wants the 
government to intervene to protect British interests, he said. 
  The British company was fined ECU32 million (35.2 million 
dollars). 
  In Duesseldorf, Germany, the German Steel Federation said 
Wednesday afternoon that its members that were fined would 
probably appeal against the decision to the European Court of 
Justice. 
  Federation president Ruprecht Vondran said "The German steel 
firms aren't going to accept these decisions without responding." 
  Separately, German industrial group Preussag AG in Hannover 
said it would oppose the EC decision "by all available means." 
  It said in a press communique that "We cannot understand" 
why 
the fine was slapped on Preussag, "since Preussag has not taken 
part in a pricing or quantities cartel. As far as we know, 
there has never been such a cartel" in the EC steel industry.

<F P=106> [Allan Saunderson report: "Bands Play a Different Tune for </F>
the EMS"] 
  [Text] Basel -- Europe seems to be coming round to the 
realisation that the drastic widening of the European Monetary 
System [EMS] bands last August does not necessarily have to be 
reversed for monetary union to continue. 
  The experience of history -- particularly the long years 
when 
the world's currencies were pegged to gold -- shows that EU 
[European Union] members states wanting to fix their exchange 
rates will probably have to jump into Stage Three of European 
Monetary Union [EMU] without moving back to narrow bands at all. 
  This at least was the consensus of a high-level meeting last 
week at the "central banks' central bank" -- the Bank for 
International Settlements (BIS) in Basel. It also matches the 
broadening view that the narrow 2.25 percent Exchange Rate 
Mechanism [ERM] divergence bands may in fact be 
counter-productive. 
  The Bundesbank, for instance, is once more peddling its 
aversion to narrow bands in public. But its senior officers 
make clear that the intervention obligations associated with the 
old European Monetary System (EMS) regime are no longer on the 
table for discussion until or unless governments can co-operate 
more effectively on overall economic policy. 
  France is also in no rush to return to a system which -- 
during the run on the franc in July -- cost them more than their 
entire foreign exchange reserves. 
  In Germany, responsibility for the deutschmark's external 
relationships lies constitutionally with the Bonn government, 
not the Bundesbank. But in reality the coalition government led 
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl is unlikely to try to tie the German 
central bank back into the marginal intervention obligations any 
time soon. 
  The two EMS crises of September 1992 and July 1993 forced 
the 
Bundesbank to create massive amounts of extra deutschmark 
liquidity which then flooded back into the country, endangering 
its efforts to control money supply and hence future inflation. 
  The feeling on the continent is that although the Maastricht 
Treaty specifies that EU member states wanting to relax 
currencies in Stage Three must have held them with "normal" ERM 
bands for at least the prior two years, this and other aspects 
of the EMU convergence criteria will be subject to political 
negotiations starting in the intergovernmental summit in the 
summer of 1996. 
  Therefore "normal" may not turn out to be the 2.25 percent 
that pertained for most years since the EMS's foundation in 1979 
but could easily be interpreted as the newly current "normality" 
of 15 percent. 
  The meeting at the BIS, organised by the Frankfurt-based 
European Association for Banking History, brought together 
senior central bankers such as European Monetary Institute [EMI] 
president Alexandre Lamfalussy, new BIS general manager Andrew 
Crockett and former Bundesbank director Leonhard Gleske to 
discuss what history could teach about currency union. 
  University of California expert Barry Eichengreen said that 
a 
viable international arrangement had to: provide a method of 
adjusting exchange rate relationships when a system is subject 
to an unexpected shock; possess a set of "robust" rules credible 
to financial markets; and have a means of containing market 
pressures -- such as the ability to change domestic interest 
rate levels. 
  The hope at the BIS meeting was that wider ERM bands may 
oblige governments to pursue balanced and credible economic 
policies to hold the value of their currencies rather than 
paying lip-service to artificially narrow divergence ranges that 
eventually burst. 
  Gleske commented "by maintaining larger (ERM) margins a 
number of countries would stick together and achieve better 
convergence of domestic policies. If this happened for a number 
of years then the countries in a smaller band would be able to 
move to monetary union." 
  Crockett said considerable EU consensus already existed for 
having "robust" monetary rules. 
  Most countries wanted to bring inflation down to 2 percent 
or 
below although there were differences over the technical means 
of achieving this. 
  Eichengreen said that in the days when the world's major 
currencies were still backed by gold reserves, central banks 
were able to use various technical measures which in effect 
"widened the bands" whenever capital inflows or outflows exerted 
revaluation or devaluation pressure. 
  The central banks of Europe and America also co-operated if 
a 
currency was under pressure by lending gold reserves to one 
another in a system not unlike the foreign exchange reserve swap 
arrangements now institutionalised at the European Monetary 
Institute. 
  Given that the BIS was founded in 1930 to try to facilitate 
just such international swap arrangements the venue of the 
meeting turned out to be appropriate. Though BIS efforts were 
thwarted during the 1930's by international political tensions, 
the EMI in the 1990's should historically speaking have a better 
chance of success.

Kinkel, peace in Bosnia will not be possible without Russia. 
This was pointed out by Kinkel in Athens this morning after 
talks with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev. The letter 
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the leader of the Bosnian 
Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, has created favorable preconditions for 
a settlement in Bosnia, he stated. 
  However, Kinkel warned against too much enthusiasm. "The 
NATO ultimatum will continue to be valid. It apparently had the 
desired effect." To achieve a peaceful settlement in Bosnia, 
Russia must by all means be involved in the talks. Kozyrev 
stated in Athens that the promise by the Bosnian Serbs to 
withdraw their weapons in exchange for the deployment of 400-500 
Russian blue berets in and around Sarajevo is the "beginning of 
the end of the war in Bosnia." 
  A new round of political dialogue between Russia and the 
European Union started in Athens this morning. It is being 
attended by the executive foreign ministers of the European 
Union from Belgium, Greece -- which currently holds the 
chairmanship of the European Union -- and its successor Germany. 
  Referring to Greece's unilateral action against the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- it closed the port of Salonika 
for all deliveries to and from Skopje -- Kinkel stressed that 
this was an "unusual step that does not correspond to practices 
within the community." Exerting pressure is no instrument for 
settling such issues. "We do not need a destabilization of 
Macedonia," he pointed out.

  [Text] Bonn -- Evacuation plans have been drafted for parts 
of the German Embassy in Belgrade. However, a decision on their 
implementation will not be made before the weekend [19-20 
February], diplomatic circles announced in Bonn today. The 
Foreign Ministry refrained from commenting publicly. In a radio 
interview, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel recommended great 
reservation, and stressed that one should wait and see whether 
the Russian initiative will be successful. A NATO air strike 
could be prevented in that case. 
  Contrary to speculation in Belgrade, the visa office, but 
not 
the entire consulate, is to be closed. The closure and the 
departure for Hungary of part of the consular staff, including 
dependents, would probably not be ordered before Sunday if no 
peaceful solution becomes visible in the Bosnian war. The NATO 
ultimatum will expire one minute after midnight on Sunday night. 
  The German Embassy will not be affected by the evacuation 
and 
will continue its work, diplomatic circles stressed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Yeltsin to Ciampi on Serb </F>
Withdrawal"] 
  [Text] Rome, 17 Feb (ANSA) -- Bosnian Serb forces have 
agreed to observe a United Nations ultimatum and withdraw heavy 
weapons from a 20km radius of Sarajevo by Sunday night [20 
February], Russian President Boris Yeltsin informed Italian 
Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in the second of two letters sent 
to Rome Thursday. 
  In the first letter, sent to leaders in the United States, 
Britain, France and Germany, Yeltsin alleged that the Western 
powers had sidestepped the UN and had gone against the 
Partnership for Peace accord between East and West in issuing an 
ultimatum in Bosnia. 
  The second letter was of a very different nature, 
well-informed sources said, briefing Ciampi on the Bosnian 
Serbs' agreement to accept Russian mediation, and to withdraw 
heavy weapons from the Sarajevo exclusion zone. 
  Confirmation that the Bosnian Serbs had begun moving their 
arms came both from commanders on the ground in Bosnia, from a 
spokesman at UN headquarters in New York and from southern 
European NATO command in Naples, where CIC Admiral Mike Boorda 
described Thursday as "very positive." 
  His deputy, General Antonio Milani was more cautious, 
telling 
the press "the pictures we see on television, of children 
playing in Sarajevo, are encouraging, as is the news that first 
positions are being evacuated and the first arms handed over... 
But this does not complete the mandate we have been given." 
  "It could prove that by Sunday night all sides will be 
satisfied," he added. "A first step has now been taken." 
  Boorda's close aide Captain Trevor Murray told journalists 
of 
the careful attack plans laid over weeks of gruelling double 
shifts, but was prepared to admit that bombarding Serb positions 
would not be the ideal solution for the conflict in the former 
Yugoslav country: "no one is kidding themselves that they can 
solve Bosnia's problems with bombardments. We all know that 
this is a very complicated situation." 
  While launching raids on Bosnia would be tricky, he added, 
"a 
mission in Bosnia would be considered much less risky than the 
war in Iraq." 
  Some 100 fighter-bombers and 80 support aircraft are 
standing 
by in bases on Italian territory, ready to take off for Bosnia 
should the need arise. More planes are on the alert aboard 
three aircraft carriers -- the French Foch, the British Ark 
Royal and the U.S. Saratoga -- in the Mediterranean. 
  A meeting of foreign ministers from France, the United 
States, Britain, and the Netherlands will take place Sunday 
evening in the Aviano U.S. airforce base in eastern Italy from 
the Operation Deny Flight is coordinated. 
  On a five-day visit to Rome, Serbian opposition leader Vuk 
Draskovic welcomed the Russian moves to avoid air strikes and 
predicted Thursday that the Bosnian Serbs would respect the 
ultimatum. "I cannot believe that (Bosnian Serb leader Radovan) 
Karadzic would be so crazy as to not respond positively to these 
requests," Draskovic said at a press conference in the Italian 
capital. 
  Commenting on Russia's reluctance to back airstrikes, the 
Serb opposition chief said he could understand Moscow's 
resentment over the way that NATO has taken the UN's policing 
work upon itself: "Russia is a great power and NATO's biggest 
mistake has been to exclude Moscow from the peace process." 
  With the truce holding on the ground around Sarajevo, more 
wounded were flown out of the Bosnian capital to Falconara 
airport in eastern Italy. A first load of 12 wounded and their 
helpers was followed later in the day by 14 more, to be 
distributed around hospitals in Italy, Spain, the United Arab 
Emirates, Austria and the United States. 
  In this evening's cabinet meeting in Rome, Social Affairs 
Minister Fernanda Contri briefed ministers on her recent visit 
to Sarajevo and told them of an accord with her Bosnian 
counterpart for humanitarian aid convoys for children of all 
religions and ethnic groups all over the beleaguered country. 
Croatia's social affairs department has also agreed, she said, 
to allow the convoys to set out from the port of Split for 
Mostar and Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Article signed BN: "Bosnia -- Federal Council Favors </F>
Respect of Ultimatum"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 16 Feb (ATS) -- The Federal Council on 
Wednesday [16 February] discussed the current situation in 
Bosnia. The Council voiced its concern at the escalation of 
violence. According to Achille Casanova, Swizerland's 
vice-chancellor, it expressed the hope that the NATO ultimatum 
issued to the belligerents on 9 February, and in particular to 
the besiegers of Sarajevo, would be respected. The question of 
military aircraft overflying Swiss airspace, he added, was not 
asked, since no such request had been made to Swizerland. 
  The issue of whether foreign military aircraft could fly 
over 
Switzerland falls into the debate on neutrality. During the 
Gulf war in 1991, Switzerland kept to the traditional definition 
[of neutrality] and banned such aircraft from entering Swiss 
airspace. Exceptions were made for the transportation of the 
wounded, hospital workers, and medical equipment. 
  The foreign policy report published last November by the 
Federal Council nevertheless marks a reorientation of political 
neutrality. The Federal Council considers that a neutral state 
can participate in coercive measures against another state as 
provided for by the UN Charter, on condition that these measures 
have the very broad backing of the international community. 
This stance is then no longer in contradiction with the right 
to neutrality. 
  The first example of this new practice was the authorization 
to overfly Swizterland granted to NATO's AWACS radar aircraft 
charged with monitoring the skies over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
Head of the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs (DFAE) Flavio 
Cotti, recently justified this measure by the humanitarian 
nature of the flights and the principle of solidarity. Mr. 
Cotti stated that the AWACS were not combat aircraft and thus 
did not constitute a precedent for a NATO request for combat 
aircraft to fly through Swiss airspace in the framework of UN 
action.

<F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "European Commission Reacts Strongly to </F>
Greek Embargo Against Macedonia"; as released by The Hague ANP 
Database] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 17 Feb (ANP) -- The European Commission 
is furious about the Greek embargo against Macedonia. 
Commission President Delors will make a declaration on Thursday 
afternoon [17 February] saying in so many words that the move is 
not in the spirit of the Union treaty. 
  Diplomats say that the unilateral move by Athens is not 
conducive to the European Union's [EU] "cohesion." Greece 
currently holds the EU presidency. "The Union must stick 
together as a union," a spokesman said. "The Greek move does 
not contribute to this." 
  Resentful reactions to Athens' move had already been seen at 
political talks between top civil servants from the member 
states on Tuesday evening. It is usual for a member state 
taking measures outside the Union to first contact the council. 
However, the Greek representative appeared to be clearly 
embarrassed by his government. The argument that a Greek harbor 
was concerned did not sound very convincing to those present, 
according to a diplomat. 
  The question will probably come up in the sidelines of the 
talks to be held in Athens on Thursday and Friday by the 
ministerial EU troika. This troika consists of Greece, Belgium 
and Germany, the present, past, and future EU presidents. A 
spokesman said it was not usual for the troika to publicly put a 
member state in the pillory without prior consultation with the 
Union member states. [passage omitted]

as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Excerpt] The Hague, 17 Feb (ANP) -- [passage omitted] The 
Netherlands, which was the victim of a similar boycott call in 
1992, said on Thursday [17 February] that the Greek decision 
harmed Macedonia's economic position and was a threat to 
political stability in the region. 
  A spokesman of the German Foreign Ministry said that the EU 
[European Union] was investigating whether Greece had broken the 
Union's laws or international law. "It is in our interest to 
have more stability in the region, not less," the spokesman said. 
  The question will be discussed on Friday in Athens during a 
meeting of the EU troika, in which the Belgian, Greek, and 
German foreign ministers will take part. The blockade of 
Macedonia would be one of the most important subjects in the 
talks, an EU spokesman said.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/106: "Visit to Israel of Mr. </F>
Manuel Marin"] 
  [Text] Mr. Marin, vice-president of the Commission, visited 
Israel from 16 to 18 February to set in motion negotiations for 
the conclusion of a new agreement between the European Union and 
Israel. 
  On 29 September the Commission presented a proposal, on the 
initiative of Mr. Marin, for a negotiating mandate aimed at 
concluding a new agreement to take the place of the more limited 
cooperation agreement concluded in 1975 as part of the European 
Community's overall Mediterranean policy. 
  This proposal reflected a desire to upgrade EC-Israel 
relations to take account of new developments in international 
relations: The single market, the treaty on European Union, the 
creation of the European Economic Area [EEA] and the new 
partnership agreements the community has proposed to the Maghreb 
countries. This process was given fresh impetus by the signing 
on 13 September of the declaration of principles between Israel 
and the PLO. 
  On 21 December the Council of the European Union formally 
approved the negotiating mandate which Mr. Marin has today 
presented to the Israeli authorities. 
  Following the meeting on 17 February with Israeli Foreign 
Minister Mr. Shimon Peres, Mr. Marin said: "The negotiations 
that have got under way today mark a new departure which will 
bolster the measures to bring about peace in the region and help 
forge closer links between the European Union and Israel." 
  In the wake of Mr. Marin's visit the technical negotiations 
on the new agreement between the two sides are to start with a 
view to concluding it as soon as possible in 1994. 
  The salient points of the new negotiating mandate approved 
by 
the Council are: 

  -  protection of human rights and democracy 
to be an essential element of the agreement; 
  -  extension of free 
trade to services, making for a better balance of trade between 
the Community and Israel; 
  -  liberalization of public procurement, 
with reciprocal access; 
  -  the possibility of associating Israel 
with the Community's framework research and development program, 
an area in which cooperation has been under way since 1983 and 
one of considerable interest to both sides; 
  -  community support 
for cooperation projects involving Israel and other countries in 
the region; 
  -  a wider and more structured political dialogue 
between the European Union and Israel; 
  -  a raft of other 
cooperation measures in areas such as energy, the environment 
and curbing drug trafficking. 
  The new agreement with Israel is also important for the 
contribution it will make to the union's backing for the Middle 
East peace process. The Commission presented its new overall 
approach on the Middle East in its communication of 8 September 
1993. 
  A balanced approach by the Union to the countries of this 
region will also be reflected in efforts to create conditions 
for a satisfactory level of economic development in the Occupied 
Territories and foster economic development in the region as a 
whole. Support for regional cooperation between all partners in 
the Middle East will be complemented by stepping up the dialogue 
between the Union and each of the countries concerned.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/138: "Commission Launches </F>
`Gateway to Japan' Export Promotion Campaign"] 
  [Text] "Gateway to Japan" is the European Commission's new 
campaign to promote European exports to Japan. One hundred and 
twenty-five million consumers with the world's highest average 
purchasing power make Japan Europe's second largest potential 
market. To make the most of this, European companies need extra 
help to deal with the special demands of the Japanese market 
ranging from information and consultancy services in Europe 
through to introducing companies to the Japanese market. The 
Commission's export promotion initiatives are not only the 
natural counterpart to its market-opening efforts with the 
Japanese, they directly meet the needs of companies exporting 
and wishing to export to Japan. 
  "Gateway to Japan" is the second integrated campaign which 
will be made up of a series of initiatives to foster lasting 
success in the Japanese market by European enterprises in 
sectors which are internationally competitive, but 
underperforming in Japan. The Commission's aims are both to 
answer the problem of the Community's trade deficit with Japan 
by helping to increase exports to Japan and to encourage 
European enterprises to confront their Japanese competitors in 
the Japanese market, enabling them to maintain their competitive 
edge in other markets worldwide. 
  The approach adopted by the Commission for the `gateway' 
campaign is based on the experiences of the first export 
promotion campaign. The campaign will provide services in 
response to the needs of companies following the logical chain 
of activities which companies face when developing trade with 
Japan. 
<H5>  Workshops </H5>
  At the first stage, `gateway' offers information for 
European 
enterprises here in Europe on their company's needs and will 
attempt to help coordinate their approach. Throughout Europe, 
the Commission will be holding strategy workshops for European 
companies interested in Japan. These will provide both general 
information on the obstacles and opportunities of the Japanese 
market and also market information on those sectors selected by 
the Commission for participation in the campaign. 
<H5>  Trade Missions and Trade Fairs </H5>
  The bulk of "Gateway to Japan" campaign activities will take 
place in Japan. on the basis of a qualitative assessment of 
export promotion methods and in the light of the experience of 
the first campaign, the Commission has identified trade missions 
and trade fairs as the most effective way of engineering 
long-term profitable relationships between European companies 
and Japanese buyers. The campaign will organize European groups 
at Japanese trade fairs, providing European pavilions, 
orchestrating European days and facilitating contacts with 
suitable, potential clients. Trade missions will take place 
before, during or after trade fairs in order to offer companies 
the opportunity to study the market and to develop contacts 
directly with Japanese counterparts. For both fairs and 
missions, participating companies may then receive financial and 
logistical support from the Commission in complementarity with 
support provided by the member states. 
  Follow-up Services 
  A Long-term commitment to developing a presence in the 
market 
is essential in order to profit to the full from the 
opportunities in Japan. 
  Bearing this in mind, the Commission will offer follow-up 
services for companies who have participated in the fairs and 
missions in Japan. In line with the view that the campaign 
should be responsive to the needs of the market, the exact 
nature of the follow-up activities will depend on the 
requirements of companies after their participation in fairs and 
missions. 
<H5>  Funding </H5>
  The scope of export promotion activities is limited by 
budget. The European Parliament agreed an increase in the exprom 
budget of ECU1.5 million to ECU8 million for the financial year 
1994. This allows ECU7.1 million for "Gateway to Japan" for the 
three years of the campaign. 
<H5>  The Sectors </H5>
  In the first phase, 1994-5, the campaign will support 
companies from the medical equipment, mechanical handling, 
machine tools and furniture sectors. For the second phase, 
1995-6, the five sectors for selection are still to be decided. 
Those under consideration include marine equipment, 
construction materials, construction equipment, waste management 
technologies and packaging machinery. 
  These sectors have been selected on the basis of three sets 
of criteria - competitivity, promotability and complementarity. 
Competitivity demands that the sector should be made up of 
European companies which are competitive in price and product 
worldwide, but which are still underperforming in the Japanese 
market. Based on the experience of the first campaign, `gateway' 
will promote seven capital goods sectors and two consumer goods 
sectors. The scope for success also depends on the extent to 
which these sectors will answer a real need in Japan. 
Naturally, therefore, selection has been and will be responsive 
to the changing demands of the Japanese market. Competitivity 
cannot be the sole criterion. The experience of the first 
campaign has shown that another significant element is the 
extent to which a sector can be promoted within the framework of 
our program. This principle of promotability requires that 
participating sectors should be represented by a strong European 
trade federation and have access to a viable trade fair in 
Japan. The campaign is also run in a spirit of complementarity 
with the member states. 
  "Gateway to Japan" aims primarily at medium-sized 
enterprises. It intends to help both those companies which wish 
to start exporting to Japan and those which are planning to 
develop their existing trade. 
  The campaign is directed by the European Commission's unit 
for relations with Japan. The campaign will be implemented by 
the non profit-making organization Eurochambres -- the 
association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
Their job will be general coordination, publicity, distribution 
of information and the sectoral initiatives of the campaign. In 
all this they will work in a consortium partnership with Roland 
Berger GmbH, the management consultants with offices in Tokyo. 
The consortium partnership of Eurochambres and Roland Berger 
was selected on the basis of a call for tender in the EC 
Official Journal. The campaign will be run in cooperation with 
both industry and the member states. National chambers of 
commerce, the European Business Council in Tokyo and European 
trade associations will provide information networks and will 
help coordinate our activities with individual companies. The 
campaign haS been developed in consultation with the member 
states in the Exprom [EC export promotion program] experts group 
meetings, meetings with the commercial counselors in Tokyo and 
through overseas national trade bodies. 
  In launching the campaign the Commission appreciates the 
cooperation and contribution of its Japanese counterparts. 
"Gateway to Japan" will be coordinating its activities with the 
import promotion programs of MITI [Japanese Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry] and JETRO [Japan External 
Trade Organization]. The Commission welcomes this active 
cooperation and sees it as further evidence of the development 
of Europe's partnership with Japan.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Home Office: "New Europol </F>
Drugs Unit Boosts Fight Against Drug Trafficking"] 
  [Text] European action to combat the growing menace of 
organised international crime was boosted today by the opening 
in the Hague of a new European drugs intelligence organisation 
-- the Europol Drugs Unit [EDU]. 
  The EDU is the first step in the creation of a European 
Police Office -- Europol -- which will be a central coordinating 
body for the exchange and analysis of intelligence on all forms 
of serious crime. 
  The EDU and Europol will not have any operational powers. 
Home Secretary Michael Howard hailed the move as a success for 
European police cooperation. 
  He Said: 
  "The drugs problem is an international one, and needs to be 
tackled at an international level. 
  "Criminals show no respect whatever for the frontiers 
between 
countries, and our efforts must be directed to the widest 
possible fields of cooperation. 
  "The EDU is a sign of Member States' determination to 
cooperate closely and effectively crack down on the growing 
menace of drug trafficking and organised crime in Europe. 
  "I believe that Europol can play an important role in 
providing information to assist national police and customs 
services in tracking down and arresting the criminals involved 
in these activities. 
  "The Drugs Unit is an encouraging start. We have two liaison 
officers in post, from the police and customs services who will 
be linked into the UK via the National Criminal Intelligence 
Service." 
  The EDU Will: 

  -  Exchange and analyse intelligence on drug 
trafficking and money laundering in the European Union and the 
criminal organisations involved in these activities 
  -  Give 
national law enforcement agencies a wider, more coordinated view 
of these activities across all Member States 
  -  Help these agencies 
target their action more effectively against drug traffickers 
and other criminals involved in serious organised crime. 
  National liaison officers have been posted to The Hague from 
all Member States . 
  Each Member State must set up a unit to act as a two-way 
link 
for the exchange of information between EDU and its own police 
and customs services. In the UK this will be the National 
Criminal Intelligence Service. 
  Europol was first proposed in 1991 by Chancellor Kohl. An 
existing UK-led initiative for a European Drugs Intelligence 
Unit was absorbed into the proposal. 
  Europol will be established on the basis of a full 
Convention 
signed and ratified by all Member states. The draft Convention 
is currently under negotiation, and a deadline for completion 
has been set for October 1994 by the European Council. 
<H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>
  1. The EDU was formally opened in the Hague by Dutch Justice 
Minister Mr Hirsch Ballin and Interior Minister Mr van Thijn. 
  2. The EDU will operate under the terms of a Ministerial 
Agreement signed by EU Interior and Justice Minsters in 
Copenhagen on 2 June 1993. Within the EDU the treatment of 
information will be governed by Member States' own national data 
protection legislation. 
  3. Europol will be an intergovernmental organisation within 
the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union. Work 
towards its establishment is the responsibility of an 
intergovernmental working group under Title VI, which reports to 
the Council of Interior and Justice Ministers. The European 
Council has set a deadline of October 1994 for completion of the 
Europol Convention. 
  4. Formal interviews for the senior management of EDU will 
take place in Brussels on 22 February. Ministers of the Interior 
and Justice will consider recommendations on 23 March. The UK 
will be bidding for one of the three posts. 
  5. The national liaison officers will work under the interim 
management of Mr Storbeck of Germany, and Colonel Bruggeman of 
Belgium.

<F P=106> [Report by Michael Cassell in Belfast, Tim Coone in Dublin </F>
and David Owen in London: "Mayhew Maintains Diplomatic Efforts 
To Find Ulster Peace"] 
  [Text] Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, 
yesterday employed further delicate diplomacy to maintain 
British government efforts aimed at encouraging all sides to 
embrace the peace process in Northern Ireland. 
  In an article published in yesterday's IRISH TIMES, Sir 
Patrick used new and more straightforward language to address 
some of the concerns and uncertainties arising from the Downing 
Street declaration and to offer a more detailed vision of what 
could lie beyond a permanent end to violence. 
  His message came as it emerged at Westminster that Sir 
Patrick has given the hardline Democratic Unionist party [DUP] a 
virtual assurance that the Anglo-lrish conference will not meet 
while political talks are taking place. Mr Peter Robinson, the 
DUP deputy leader, said a letter recently received from the 
Northern Ireland secretary indicated "a willingness to suspend" 
the conference. 
  The DUP -- which is boycotting the talks process -- last 
week 
wrote to Mr John Major requesting a meeting before the prime 
minister's next encounter with Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish 
counterpart, on Saturday. 
  According to Mr Robinson, Sir Patrick also stressed that 
there was no requirement for the DUP to accept the joint 
declaration as the basis for political talks. 
  In yesterday's article, Sir Patrick forcefully reiterated 
the 
government's insistence that the IRA must end hostilities and 
that Sinn Fein must renounce the justification of violence and 
commit itself exclusively to the democratic process. But he 
also attempted to edge forward on some areas cited by 
republicans as being in need of clarification. 
  His remarks were welcomed by Mr Reynolds. 
  Sir Patrick repeated his view that, in the event of an end 
to 
IRA violence, Sinn Fein could be admitted to exploratory talks 
"within three months" rather than at the end of a three-month 
quarantine period. He said that once it was clear that all 
terrorist violence had ceased for good, the benefits to the 
community would include "our ability to manage without troops 
being deployed in support of the police and without emergency 
legislation." 
  Sir Patrick said Britain "cannot and will not adopt the role 
of persuader for any particular outcome" and that "with or 
without" Sinn Fein, the process would go ahead. He added: "We 
are, however, persuaders who urge the really committed to search 
for widely-based agreement." 
  In a passage intended to assure nationalists, Sir Patrick 
said he wanted to see "substantial devolved powers" in Northern 
Ireland but he emphasised that this would not be done on a 
unilateral basis but through agreement within the so-called 
three-stranded talks process which includes the Irish 
government. "We cannot revert to a system of government in 
Northern Ireland with which only one part of the community can 
readily identify." 
  In Ulster, local politicians yesterday voiced alarm over the 
rise in attacks by loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Seamus Mallon, 
deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said 
members of his party were increasingly being singled out as 
terrorist targets.

<F P=106> [Report on series of interviews with the leaders of Northern </F>
Ireland's main parties by David Owen; place and date not given: 
"Ulster Talks Cry Out for Early Success"] 
  [Text] The gamble appears to have failed. Now it is time 
to revert to more orthodox methods. 
  With hopes of an early IRA response to the Downing Street 
declaration fading fast, London has been trying to inject 
momentum into the three-year-old talks process with Ulster's 
nonviolent political parties. 
  It badly needs a success to prevent the impetus behind the 
drive for a lasting settlement for the province from draining 
away. 
  There are also hopes that progress in the political talks 
might yet be the lever that eventually persuades republican 
leaders to ditch the armed struggle and embrace the process. As 
Dr John Alderdice, leader of the nonsectarian Alliance party, 
puts it: "As Sinn Fein sees the train drawing out of the 
station, they may be prepared to jump on board." 
  Yet a series of FINANCIAL TIMES interviews in recent days 
with the leaders of the four main constitutional parties 
indicates that many serious obstacles still stand in the way of 
a positive outcome. 
  The leaders' comments, in brief, point to a long and 
tortuous 
process with success far from assured. 
  The words with which the Reverend Ian Paisley greeted the 
announcement by the then Northern Ireland secretary Mr Peter 
Brooke in March 1991 that a basis for formal political talks 
existed still seem apposite. 
  "The gate into the field has been opened," the leader of the 
hardline Democratic Unionist party [DUP] said at the time. 
"But...there is a lot of hard ploughing in front of us." 
  The main problem areas appear to be as follows: 
  The "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" 
formula. 
  This, by definition, precludes the possibility of gradual 
progress. Every syllable and punctuation mark has to be agreed 
before anything can be set in stone. 
  Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social 
Democratic and Labour party [SDLP], regards the principle as 
"crucially important." It ensures the talks address all the 
relationships -- within Northern Ireland, between north and 
south, and between the two governments, he says. 
  An agreement confined to the question of "who wields power 
in 
Northern Ireland" would not necessarily solve the province's 
problems, Mr Hume believes. 
  Unionists favour a less ambitious framework paving the way 
for a return to devolved government in Ulster, independent of 
what might be agreed in the other two "strands" of the talks 
process. 
  They point out that a blueprint for an Ulster assembly was 
drawn up by a working party comprising all four constitutional 
parties during the talks initiated by Mr Brooke. 
  Mr Paisley says openly that as far as he is concerned, the 
formula no longer applies. It was exposed as a "fallacy" during 
the "failed" Brooke talks process, he says. 
  How to handle the relationship between the north and 
Dublin. 
  There is no disguising the fundamental differences between 
the participants on this second strand of the talks process. 
  An Ulster Unionist party [UUP] document to be published this 
month will argue that the relationship should be handled by ad 
hoc meetings between Irish ministers and Ulster assembly 
representatives. 
  But proposals implying that no separate north-south 
institution -- such as a dedicated secretariat -- is necessary 
would probably be anathema to the SDLP and to Dublin. 
  Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, goes so far as to say: 
"Not only are the institutionalised bits unnecessary, but they 
are unconstitutional. They would tend to tie elected 
representatives from one part of the United Kingdom into 
bargains-arrangements-undertakings without our sovereign 
government being aware of it," he says. 
  The DUP's boycott of the talks. 
  Not only is Sinn Fein excluded from the talks process. So at 
present is the DUP. While this could make agreement between 
those who are participating less difficult to achieve, it might 
also undermine its effectiveness. 
  As Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said 
yesterday: "A political settlement that brings peace is one 
that has to have widespread acceptance." 
  The current DUP line is that it will not return to the talks 
until London explicitly rules out any possibility of a united 
Ireland. According to one senior DUP official, London would 
have to "embark on a new security policy that demonstrates the 
British are here to stay, irrespective of consent." 
  The reluctance of some participants to move from 
bilateral discussions back to a roundtable format. 
  After the experience of the Brooke talks, some are wary of 
returning to what they see as the "goldfish-bowl" of roundtable 
discussions. 
  There is though a general recognition that the current 
time-consuming bilateral structure cannot continue indefinitely. 
  Mr Molyneaux favours "a fair amount of commonality" being 
established before participants go back to sitting around a 
table. 
  The two governments' apparent inability to prevent a 
continuation of terrorism. 
  It is in Mr Hume's words "quite obvious" that the talks 
process's prospects of success would be improved immeasurably if 
they took place "in an atmosphere of total peace." 
  That is why the SDLP leader says he has pleaded for patience 
in awaiting Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration. 
Continuing terrorist killings can only exacerbate tensions. 
  But can a cessation of violence be delivered even in the 
event of an end to the IRA's 25-year campaign? Mr Paisley, for 
one, is pessimistic.

<F P=106> [David Hencke report: "Thatcher's Secret Arms Deal"] </F>
  [Text] Britain agreed a secret pact with Malaysia to 
subsidise defence exports for British Aerospace and GEC [General 
Electric Company] as part of the 1 billion pound arms-for-aid 
deal involving the Pergau dam, according to a confidential 
document signed between the two governments by Lady Thatcher and 
Mohammed Mahathir in September 1988. 
  The memorandum of understanding, a copy of which has been 
obtained by the GUARDIAN reveals that the Government was 
prepared to set up cheap loans for the Malaysians to subsidise 
their purchase of British defence exports. The Government would 
pay the difference between the banks' commercial rates and the 
concessionary rate it was offering, involving potential 
subsidies worth tens of millions of pounds. 
  Labour and Liberal Democrat MP's expressed outrage last 
night. The terms of the memorandum were "absolutely monstrous," 
said Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman. 
  The funding deal is in addition to the 234 million pound aid 
that Britain agreed to give to Malaysia to build the Pergau dam, 
which was described as a bad buy by Sir Tim Lankester, permanent 
secretary at the Overseas Development Administration. 
  Foreign Office ministers have already admitted that this aid 
was tied to a mathematical formula on the sale of arms. 
  On funding, the agreement reads: "The total payment for any 
equipment procured under this (memorandum) will be provided by 
the Malaysian government but in the event that there is any 
shortfall in the funding, the United Kingdom government will 
assist in the arrangement of financial facilities provided by a 
United Kingdom bank or a group of United Kingdom banks and the 
United Kingdom will ensure that the interest to be charged will 
be at concessionary rates." 
  The 15-part memorandum reveals that Britain was prepared to 
go further than the normal practice of providing spares and 
ensuring that defence companies offered training to foreign 
troops and pilots in the use of arms equipment. In this case 
the Government agreed to train Malaysian troops in Britain in 
military strategy, advising on war and defence plans. 
  The document reveals that like the huge arms deal with Saudi 
Arabia, Lady Thatcher agreed to set up a unit inside the 
Ministry of Defence [MoD] in support of the 1 billion pound 
deal, and she established an MoD team in Malaysia to assist. 
  Lady Thatcher also agreed to supply the Malaysians with a 
list of firms supplying arms aircraft and ships, and advising on 
companies the Government regarded as most reliable. 
  The British proposed to charge the Malaysian government a 
sum 
tied to the order price of up to 10 million pounds as a 
management fee for its assistance in training and advice, 
including a down-payment of 1 million pounds within 30 days of 
the first order being made. 
  Mr Campbell said: "The terms of the funding arrangements 
which required the British government to arrange cheap credit 
for the Malaysian government are absolutely monstrous. What 
possible justification can there be for such an arrangement 
unless there was a direct connection with some other financial 
deal?" 
  Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne, East, which 
includes the Swan Hunter shipyard which lost the bid for two 
Malaysian frigates to its rivals Yarrow Shipbuilders, said: 
"Contrary to what we were told by the Government at the time, 
Britain was secretly rating the bids from different companies 
instead of operating a level playing field." 
  George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, said: "This is 
absolutely outrageous. It amounts to a sweetheart deal financed 
by the British taxpayer." 
  The deal has led to an order for British Aerospace Hawk 
trainer aircraft and two frigates from Yarrow, a GEC subsidiary. 
But orders for Tornado aircraft and submarines have not 
materialised. 
  Last night the Foreign Office said the memorandum was 
confidential: "It is only for the eyes of both governments and 
is not a published document."

<F P=106> [Annika Savill article: "Spy Services Fear Blow to U.S. </F>
Link"] 
  [Text] Indignation abounds in Britain's foreign 
intelligence community about a spending review of MI6 and GCHQ 
[Government Communications Headquarters] that they expect will 
lead to permanent cuts, primarily in the latter. They say 
hacking away at GCHQ, responsible for spy satellites and 
listening stations, could do serious damage to Britain's 
Atlantic alliance. The less Britain is able to provide in the 
intelligence-sharing arrangement with the United States, the 
less it can expect in return from GCHQ's American cousin, the 
National Security Agency [NSA]. 
  As one British official said: "It is one of the few 
meaningful aspects left of the special relationship. It is 
genuinely a relationship of equals, covering the full range of 
signals intelligence." 
  The review of the foreign intelligence capabilities is due 
to 
report to the Prime Minister before the summer recess. It was 
ordered by Sir Robin Butler, the Cabinet Secretary, in response 
to Treasury paranoia about public spending in general, and 
resentment of the diplomatic and intelligence services in 
particular. Because the GCHQ budget, at around 500m pounds, is 
almost two and a half times that of MI6, it can expect to be the 
bigger target. Intelligence sources point out that much of the 
GCHQ budget is spent on equipment for operations like satellite 
surveillance and that its flexibility is therefore limited. 
  The indignation of GCHQ staff was manifested in the recent 
leaking to a newspaper of a confidential letter by the GCHQ 
director outlining the review. An inquiry is under way at 
Cheltenham into those resonsible for the leak. "People are as 
we speak being shot at GCHQ," said one source. 
  But it seems many officials at the Foreign Office itself -- 
which will have a strong voice in the conclusions of the review 
-- are in favour of trimming the GCHQ operation. Their rivals 
in the intelligence services say that this is because the FCO 
[Foreign and Commonwealth Office] -- itself under the Treasury 
cosh -- hopes to become the beneficiary of any cuts in the 
intelligence services, by being allowed to keep more funds. 
Since it is common knowledge that the Treasury is out to cut 
public services across the board, it is unlikely anybody in the 
FCO would be so foolish. "It is a question of savings to the 
tax payer, not to anyone else," said one official. 
  There is another school of thought -- shared by some 
officials in the Foreign Office. It is that at more than 6,000 
staff, GCHQ is seriously overstaffed. It is deemed to be 
peopled by "numbercrunchers" who churn out a needless wealth of 
indigestible raw material, much of it never read; and that it 
should be restructured entirely to employ people capable of 
analysing what it finds out to establish if, and to whom, it is 
of any use. 
  It emerges that the American cousins, of whom the British 
service is so solicitous, have the same problem. A recent 
Congressional hearing focused on complaints by US government 
departments at the difficulty of accessing relevant information 
in the dense mass of raw material. "The NSA [National Security 
Agency] doesn't even bother to provide a summary of its material 
to its consumers," said one intelligence analyst. "They just 
tell them `This is the access code, find it yourself.'" 
  Since the end of the Soviet Union, all Western intelligence 
services have been forced to reexamine their roles in life. It 
is no secret that the reason MI6 has decided to go public is not 
because of lofty government aspirations to openness but because 
it is trying to defend its funds. It defines its post-Cold War 
role as threefold: the fight against terrorism, nuclear 
proliferation and drugs. 
  A further problem of what to do with the intelligence 
community in the new world disorder will arise in 1997, when the 
large British base in Hong Kong will have to make way for the 
Chinese. 
  There is speculation that some of them will transfer to an 
American base in Taiwan -- a sensitive move diplomatically -- 
and others go to Malaysia and Singapore. The cosiest scenario 
is that some will join their Australian allies at a signals 
intelligence base in Shoal Bay, near Darwin.

"Ministry of Defence Awards 300 Million Pounds Contract for 
Satellite Replacement"] 
  [Text] A contract worth over 300 million pounds has been 
awarded for two operational military communication satellites, 
Minister for Defence Procurement Jonathan Aitken announced 
today. Answering a Parliamentary Question from Rod Richards MP 
(Clwyd North West), Mr Aitken said: 
  "A contract worth some 300 million pounds has been awarded 
today for the development, production and delivery in orbit of 
two Skynet 4 Stage 2 military communication satellites. These 
will replace the existing Skynet 4 Stage 1 satellites as they 
approach the end of their operational life. 
  "British Aerospace is the prime contractor for this work. 
The 
main sub-contractors are Matra Marconi Space (UK) for satellite 
communications payload work and McDonnell Douglas and 
Arianespace for the launch vehicles. This is an important 
contract which will ensure the continued well-being of the UK's 
space industry and contribute to its long term future." 
<H5>  Notes To Editors: </H5>
  Skynet 4 Stage 2 will be accepted into service in March and 
December 1998. The satellites will be for the sole use of the UK 
military forces and are expected to be positioned in 
geostationary orbit at 1 degree west for the first satellite and 
either 53 degrees east or 34 degrees west for the second.

<F P=106> [Anne Segall report: "Job Figures Hit Recovery Hope"] </F>
  [Text] An unexpected rise in unemployment added yesterday 
to the growing sense of unease over the patchy and uncertain 
nature of the economic recovery. 
  The news that the number of people out of work rose by 
15,500 
to 2.788 million in January after four consecutive monthly falls 
led to calls for further cuts in interest rates to help cushion 
the effect of higher taxes in the spring. There were other signs 
that the economy could be losing momentum. 
  Although the Central Statistical Office [CSO] was able to 
dismiss the suggestions of a sharp slowdown in spending 
contained in a recent Confederation of British Industry [CBI] 
Survey, retailers expressed some reservations about the trend in 
high street activity. 
  According to the CSO, spending increased by 0.6 per cent in 
volume in January to a level 3.5 per cent higher than a year 
earlier. It also estimated that sales have risen by 0.8 per 
cent over the past three months. 
  But the rise in volumes in January was rather less than 
might 
have been expected given the huge discounts on offer in some 
shops. 
  Retailers fear consumers are behaving cautiously following 
recent publicity surrounding the impact that tax rises will have 
from April. 
  According to Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director at the 
Retail Consortium which represents 90 per cent of retailers, 
"consumers may have started to tighten their spending in the 
light of pending tax increases and the uncertainty of wage 
increases in this time of low inflation." 
  The consortium has appealed to the Chancellor, Mr Clarke, to 
"nurse" consumer confidence by allowing base rates to fall 
further. 
  There was a smaller-than-expected rise in the headline 
inflation rate -- from 1.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent -- in 
January, but the increase was attributed mainly to technical 
factors and analysts are predicting that the rate will fall back 
towards two per cent in the coming months. 
  The "underlying" inflation rate which excludes volatile 
mortgages, underpinned the view of analysts that inflationary 
pressures in the economy remain subdued. It rose from 2.7 per 
cent to 2.8 per cent in January. 
  The Chancellor, in an interview on Radio 4, admitted 
consumer 
demand would be affected by higher taxes, but said that those on 
middle incomes who faced the biggest increases had benefited 
from huge falls in mortgage payments. "And that is why they are 
able to increase their consumption," he said. 
  Mr Clarke was "quite confident" that the economy would grow 
by 2.5 per cent this year as predicted by the Treasury. 
  The Employment Secretary, Mr Hunt, described the jobless 
figures as "erratic" and said: "The downward path can be 
uneven. But it remains a downward path." 
  Investors were confident of a cut in base rates -- possibly 
a 
further 1/4-point reduction -- and the FT-SE [FINANCIAL 
TIMES-Stock Exchange] index closed 24.5 points up at 3417.7.

<F P=106> [David Lascelles article: "Splitting the Atom Fuels a </F>
Privatisation"] 
  [Text] The government is expected to announce the 200 
million pound sale of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), 
later this week, heralding one of the more unusual 
privatisations yet attempted. 
  For one thing, the authority wiIl have to be split into two 
parts to separate the sellable bits from those which will have 
to stay in government hands. The radioactive sites left over 
from 40 years of experimentation and development of the UK 
nuclear industry will remain the responsibility of the state. 
  For another, the assets being sold will consist largely of 
the employees' brainpower rather than plant and equipment. 
Valuing the business will therefore provide a special challenge 
to City advisers. 
  Privatisation could take many forms. The company could be 
floated on the stock exchange where its value would be in the 
order of 200 million pounds. Alternatively it could be sold 
whole or in bits. However, any purchaser would have to 
safeguard the independence on which AEA's reputation would 
depend. There could even be a management buy-out. 
  Sir Anthony Cleaver, the former chief of IBM's UK 
subsidiary, 
who is now the AEA's chairman, is keen to see the AEA move into 
the private sector. He describes it as unique and capable of 
generating healthy profits. 
  The split will take place in April. One half will retain the 
various nuclear installations such as the Dido and Pluto 
experimental reactors at Harwell, the company's headquarters, 
which are being shut down and will have to be decommissioned. 
The costs of this work will be borne by the taxpayer. 
  The second, to be named AEA Technology, will be privatised 
as 
a consultancy offering a wide range of expertise not only in the 
nuclear field, but also in other high-tech areas of industry. 
  Sir Anthony sees three broad areas of operation. One is what 
he calls plant optimisation: offering services to enable 
companies to make the best use of production plant, and 
extending its life. AEA possesses technologies which could be 
applied to areas such as chemicals, food and drinks processing 
and pharmaceuticals. 
  The second area is safety assessment. Again, this could be 
applied not only to nuclear plant and industry, but other areas 
such as transport where demand will grow with rail privatisation. 
  The third is the environment. With the acquisition last year 
of the government's Warren Springs environmental research 
laboratory, AEA plans to create a national environmental 
technology centre. 
  At the moment, 70 per cent of AEA's turnover is related to 
the nuclear industry. Sir Anthony expects to see that fall to 
30 per cent over the coming years as the nonnuclear side 
strengthens. About 40 per cent of its work is government or 
public sector. But the private side is the fastest growing, and 
its proportion will increase. 
  Similarly, Sir Anthony sees the AEA's foreign business 
growing from the present level of 20-25 per cent. Business in 
Japan, for example, has doubled in the last two years. 
  AEA Technology will account for about 200-250 million pounds 
of the authority's current total turnover of about 400 million 
pounds a year. It will also employ 3,500 of the present 7,500 
employees, though the restructuring is likely to produce about 
2,000 redundancies. Employment has already halved since 1989, 
when the AEA began to be reshaped for privatisation. 
  A chief executive for the privatised division should be 
appointed in the next couple of months. Sir Anthony says he is 
looking for someone with a commercial background who can handle 
the technological aspects and the international dimension to the 
business, and understand the needs of both the public and 
private sectors. The big difficulty, though, is valuing this 
business. If most of AEA's assets are its people, it could 
easily lose them. But Sir Anthony believes that the challenge 
of creating a new business plus the AEA's range of technological 
expertise will be a powerful incentive for people to stay. 
  He is evasive on the issue of profitability. The AEA as a 
whole lost 48 million pounds last year, mainly because of 62 
million pounds of exceptional costs linked to the restructuring. 
The year before it made a profit 14 million pounds. Sir 
Anthony will only say that AEA Technology could make profits in 
double figures. 
  The package offered to investors or potential buyers would 
have to include clear indications of the company's contracts and 
its growth prospects. One way of making it attractive would be 
for the government to sign large long-term contracts to service 
the parts retained in the public sector. Sir Anthony. though, 
is keen to keep the company in one piece. "Our challenge is to 
demonstrate the value of one entity."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In a joint appeal, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel 
have described strengthening Russia's reform policy as the most 
effective defense against nationalism. Kozyrev, who has often 
made contradictory statements and rejected NATO influence in the 
East as well as a tough military stance against the Serbs in 
recent weeks, had the joint appeal with Kinkel published in the 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE (Friday [18 February] edition). 
  In the article, the foreign ministers, who are meeting in 
Athens on Thursday and Friday, conjure up a "long-term strategic 
vision." The Partnership for Peace offered by NATO is not 
mentioned, but what is mentioned is a strategy for partnership 
that must entail support for political and economic reforms in 
Russia and neighboring countries. According to the paper, the 
Foreign Ministry stressed that in view of the outcome of the 
Russian elections, Kozyrev accorded particular importance to 
continuing free market economic development in drawing up the 
appeal.

  [Text] Bonn -- Finance Minister Theo Waigel welcomed the 
lowering of the discount rate. "With this, the Bundesbank 
continues its course of gradually lowering the interest rate 
level in Germany," he said in Bonn. The Bundesbank decision and 
the government's consistent austerity and consolidation policy 
strengthen the conditions for an inflation-free upward economic 
trend. The interest rate reduction is also a call upon the wage 
round partners to create favorable conditions for an economic 
recovery by concluding agreements that provide stability, Waigel 
said. 
  The German Banking Association spoke of a "decision 
appropriate in the current situation." With this, the 
Bundesbank continues a successful policy of reducing interest 
rates step by step, without creating any confusion in the 
capital market or the international financial markets. Like the 
Bundesbank, the Banking Association also expects a steadying of 
prices in the course of 1994. The Banking Association once 
again called on the wage round partners and the financial 
policymakers of the federal and laender governments to meet 
their responsibilities concerning stability.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel 
(Christian Social Union -- CSU) sees neither a "gap of justice" 
in the present wage and income tax scale nor in the state 
financing of Germany unity through austerity measures and the 
solidarity contribution. In a letter to the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]/CSU Bundestag Group that became known to 
DPA on Thursday [17 February], Waigel now provides deputies with 
arguments against the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
with comprehensive accounts of burdens. 
  One "cannot talk" of preferential treatment of higher 
incomes 
or discrimination of people with small incomes, he stressed. As 
of 1995, no solidarity contribution will be collected from a 
four-person family with two children and a gross income of 
47,197 German marks [DM] per year. The full surcharge to the 
wage tax with a rate of 7.5 percent will only become due 
starting at DM52,166. According to the income tax scale, 
high-income earners are already now considerably more burdened 
than regular earners, which has disastrous consequences for 
industrial enterprises. Another substantial tax burden, 
repeatedly and emphatically demanded by the SPD, would 
significantly restrict the financial scope for necessary 
investments, it was stated. 
  At the same time, the finance minister rejected the SPD 
reproach that the transfer to eastern Germany via social 
insurances is socially unjust. In 1993, funds of DM57.5 billion 
flew from the Federal Employment Office (39.5 billion) and the 
pension insurance (18 billion) to the new laender; DM33.3 
billion of it or just under 58 percent come from federal 
subsidies, that is tax proceeds. Insurance contributions from 
employers and employees account for the rest, Waigel reported. 
However, even regarding the funds from social contributions, 
the benefits have always been granted independently of the 
regional origin of the funds. "There is obviously no reason to 
deviate from this because of the establishment of the unity of 
the German state," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michel Rocard, secretary general of the </F>
Socialist Party, by Jean Daniel; place and date not given: 
"What the Socialists Have To Reinvent"] 
  [Text] For the first time since his big bang speech, the 
man who wrenched control of the PS [Socialist Party] -- and who 
is playing the difficult role of opposition leader to Edouard 
Balladur -- is trying to redefine his party's doctrine. Can the 
Socialists be reborn from their legislative ashes? They will 
try to prove they can at their meeting on Saturday [5 February] 
and Sunday, their first meeting on social transformation to 
which they have invited every single leftist group. After the 
fall of the Berlin Wall, the deepening crisis, and especially 
the historic defeat that was much more than a mere electoral 
turnaround, the Left wants to show that it still has ideas. The 
PS secretary told Jean Daniel about his ideas. 
  [Daniel] Are politicians currently aware of the new 
challenges facing our society? Caught up as they are in 
short-term deadlines and driven by legitimate ambitions, do they 
not run the risk of losing sight of the international dimension 
of the problems that are appearing? 
  [Rocard] I do not think so. It is legitimate for them to be 
questioned most often about the immediate concerns of the 
French. So that is what they talk about most. Fortunately, that 
does not stop them from also thinking beyond these issues. I do 
not think you can understand your era without bearing world 
events in mind. 
  [Daniel] When General De Gaulle, at the age of 15, reenacted 
the Napoleonic wars on paper, and said "That is what I would 
have done, and that is what I am going to do," he believed his 
personal genius would coincide with France's interests. When 
Mendes France advocated withdrawal from Indochina, he knew he 
would be the best person to apply what he recommended. Do you 
sometimes have this feeling that you are a man that France needs? 
  [Rocard] I am not one of those people who, from the age of 
15, believed in their destiny. Rather, I have led a militant, 
committed, combative, and collective life. I pride myself on 
always being surrounded by people who are my intellectual 
equals. That is life: with its coincidences, trajectory, and a 
continuity that have led me to where I am. It could have been 
different, but that is the way it is. I have responsibilities. 
I wanted them. I shoulder them. I have the feeling that I 
have thoughts and an approach in politics that can match the 
needs of the country. 
  [Daniel] So you think that political ambition is moral? 
  [Rocard] Yes, provided that one assumes the contradiction 
that exists between the function of the intellectual and the 
function of the man of power. I am in the power category, but I 
think that a society cannot be led well without critical and 
analytical thought for supporting proposals. Too many French 
intellectuals refuse the ethics of responsibility or do not dare 
to take their prophesying to its conclusion. This is something 
that politics cannot allow. A recent example is when we have to 
talk about Bosnia.... 
  [Daniel] You did that. 
  [Rocard] I did that. I said to myself that when you are 
ashamed, and you have no responsibilities, then you can opt for 
silence, or, on the contrary, for mumbo jumbo -- but these two 
paths are both closed to officials. The third path is 
difficult, but how can we remain impassive before the bodies of 
children torn to pieces in the snow? The men in power know that 
if we are to put an end to this war, then we will have to go in, 
with all the risks that such a move entails. Is it possible? I 
think it is. We will come back to that. However, we have to 
convince public opinion, on the one hand, and our partners, on 
the other. That can be frustrating, but it is essential. If 
you believe in your political mission, you must accept 
compromises. There is no dishonor in that. For a politician, 
dishonor lies in silence or lies, not in taking other people's 
positions, hesitancy, concerns, or even ambiguities into account. 
  [Daniel] The ambiguity comes from what the people think you 
to be, you who are the secretary of the Socialist Party and 
candidate for president. We see you as someone who says: "If I 
were in power, I would do something else." That is what public 
opinion understands you to be. 
  [Rocard] What did I say? I said that since the status quo 
was unacceptable we had to impose a cease-fire. Who can wield 
such force? France alone? Surely not. No nation -- not even 
the United States -- can throw itself alone into this kind of 
adventure. The decision to intervene can only come from the 
international community, i.e., from the United Nations. Now, 
the United Nations' predisposition to make such a decision is 
weak. Moreover, it would do so in such a way that the problem 
would not be solved. The nations will first have to assume the 
risks that they will be making their soldiers run. The soldiers 
are ready; that is their job and they know why they have been 
chosen. However, it is the leaders who, for obvious reasons, 
are not seeing their determination through. In Sarajevo, 1,600 
children have already been killed! Every day there is a Guernica. 
  [Daniel] Could we have acted differently or sooner? 
  [Rocard] Yes. But only democracy learns to settle conflicts 
by means other than violence. None of these peoples had a 
tradition or culture of democracy. That region has always been 
a place for tough border adjustments between Islam and 
Christianity, between orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism. We would 
have had to maintain a Yugoslav federation as it was: a 
multiethnic international political power. That was Mitterrand's 
first reflex, although I will admit that it was not mine. Since 
we did not do that, we recognized identities that did not 
identify frontiers but presupposed ethnic groups! What strikes 
me in this affair is the importance of the concept of 
secularism. The whole thing is exploding because nobody over 
there knows what state secularism is. 
  [Daniel] In Sarajevo you cannot talk of secularism in the 
strict sense of the word, but rather of a harmony between 
communities. 
  [Rocard] True harmony comes from having the respect of 
differences take root in common values. That is the very 
definition of secularism. Peace is always fragile and always 
under threat. To maintain it, I believe that we must meet two 
conditions: remain constantly open, and quickly block anything 
that might make the situation get out of hand. This was true in 
New Caledonia in 1988 when I was prime minister. It is true 
today with the abandonment of the Falloux law amendment, which 
was going to bring back the education wars. That is what was 
not done for the former Yugoslavia. The chancelleries agreed to 
the dismembering of the country without supporting the 
democratic forces which, nevertheless, were present everywhere, 
including in Serbia. If we had been able to recognize them, 
encourage them, and listen to them, then perhaps we could have 
started down another path. That is my first comment. 
  My second one is that we cannot think about peace without 
thinking about force. The people who point the finger at Europe 
are often the same people who have long fought against the idea 
of Europe having powers in the areas of defense and foreign 
policy. It is nothing short of outrageous to demand that Europe 
make a unanimous decision, when it has been prohibited from 
dealing with these matters! In this, I can see a nationalist 
attempt to quietly undermine Europe. We are well aware that 
there is no political will without the means to achieve it. 
  [Daniel] Surely France is displaying a paradoxical attitude 
when, after a wave of anti-Americanism that culminated in the 
GATT movement, we hear the defense minister now ask for American 
intervention in Bosnia. 
  [Rocard] No, I do not disapprove of this. It is one thing to 
turn down the all-powerful United States, but it is another 
thing to deny their power. When I say that the United Nations 
must "get tougher," this means that inside the United Nations, 
and within the Security Council, everyone -- including the 
United States -- must assume their responsibilities. 
  We are emerging from a 70-year struggle between Communism 
and 
the free world. The side of freedom won because it brought 
together all those people for whom democracy was truly 
meaningful, and also because it had the most formidable of 
weapons: economic efficiency. This victory had a cost: We 
thought that by fighting Communism we were fighting not a 
state-controlled perversion of social organization, but the 
pretention of the state to regulate freedom. This is partly 
true, but we pushed the argument too far. Since the 
all-powerful state was dangerous, we said, the market forces, 
which are also the forces of freedom, were going to get us out 
of the world's troubles and allow us to find growth again. That 
was a mistaken use of symmetry. The market is not responsible 
for social balances. The market has no way of preventing its 
deep-rooted tendency to push toward concentration: an 
increasing amount of money for the richest people, and an 
increasing amount of concentration for enterprises. 
  Of course, democracy presupposes the market freedom which we 
need. We simply want to put limits on it while maintaining it, 
because the struggle against social inequality is not a matter 
for the market, but for rules. Giving everyone equal 
opportunities, protecting the environment, providing education, 
promoting basic research, and ensuring social protection and 
everyone's right to health are all functions which the market 
cannot assume. Look at the United States and Great Britain: 
Both countries went so far in accepting uncontrolled free 
enterprise that they are now torn apart by a social antagonism 
that is weakening them. 
  [Daniel] At the birth of capitalism, moral concerns were 
just 
as much in the forefront of people's thinking as market 
concerns, since they resulted from the Protestant idea that 
money is necessary while also assuming the rules of loyalty, 
fair play, and integrity. Therefore, we could posit that 
capitalism had "social" origins. 
  [Rocard] As a Protestant I think you are paying us more than 
our due. This puritan and virtuous capitalism never really 
existed as such. Adam Smith knew that only too well, since on 
the one hand he wrote The Wealth of Nations and on 
the other hand he wrote a treatise on morality, and was very 
careful to keep them separate. All excesses stem from there.... 
  [Daniel] What do you consider to be today's great excesses? 
  [Rocard] Firstly, excesses in the financial sphere. People 
have discovered that to make their fortunes they no longer have 
to produce goods, but instead they can trade in money and that 
the cost of this trade is borne by production. The current 
severe crisis in Japan is a perfect example of this: The 
production of goods and services other than money has slowed 
down and is almost in a recession because the financial burden 
is excessive. 
  [Daniel] This financial capitalism in the United States, for 
example, is now subject to legal controls to a much greater 
extent than ours is. 
  [Rocard] That is true, but this control only aims to ensure 
that levies are legal, whereas what we really need to do is 
lighten them. Moreover, it is quite characteristic of a system 
in which the legal sphere is growing, in the United States, at 
the expense of all other activities. 
  [Daniel] It is curious to hear you condemning this excess of 
virtue.... 
  [Rocard] I am not confusing justice with legalism, or virtue 
with impotence! The problem is a simple if considerable one. 
We have to introduce another idea of the state, a state that is 
less kingly, less centrist or centralizing, less bureaucratic 
and more partnership oriented. That is a blueprint for the 
society of the future, the great plan of our time. Where is the 
second Keynes, the great nonmonetarist economist (18 Nobel 
prizes for economy were won by monetarists!), who will show us 
the way? The stakes are huge, for we are threatened with not 
being able to find our way back to growth. That means the end 
of the stability of our societies, the end of cohesion and of 
the chance for the Third World to develop, since it can only 
develop not just through what we do for it, but also what we do 
with it and because of it. That is the real challenge: We have 
to redefine democratic socialism. 
  [Daniel] In short, you are arguing that the state's role be 
strengthened? 
  [Rocard] Yes. Redefined and strengthened, because as we 
fight the excesses of statist power we end up becoming less 
effective in the important struggles against money laundering 
and drug trafficking. We must rebuild a public power capable of 
carrying out its responsibilities of social cohesion. Our 
fellow citizens are in great need of security: quite simply, 
job security and physical security. They also have justified 
requirements in terms of education, heath, and justice. To meet 
their requirements, the state must be authoritative, on 
condition that it is considered to be useful and noble rather 
than intrusive. Socialism has not been able to invent this in 
an economic context dominated by competitiveness. Let us then 
rethink capitalism, that is to say the conditions in which the 
market can continue to exert its full power without sowing the 
seeds of social disharmony: What are the rules, what are the 
limitations, and what are the constraints? 
  [Daniel] Do you have any suggestions? 
  [Rocard] I believe that West Europe is the best place and 
that social democracy the best political instrument with which 
to experiment with what tomorrow will be an unavoidable plan for 
society. 
  [Daniel] Europe is weak, and surely the social democratic 
model has had its day? 
  [Rocard] No. On the contrary, this model is in the process 
of evolving, especially in Europe where the social democrat 
leaders are currently reflecting on their situation. What makes 
Europe original? It provides its citizens with a social 
protection that no other continent has -- not North America, not 
Australia, not Japan, to mention just the developed countries. 
The European identity could be defined thus: rights of man, a 
high standard of living, and social security. We alone have 
been able to create and defend these three things. 
  [Daniel] It is meritorious, but can it still be saved? 
  [Rocard] Preserving a high level of protection against 
countries that practice social dumping requires flexibility and 
rigorous management and even -- and I am going to shock everyone 
by this -- a reexamination of certain acquired rights. It is 
all about saving the most essential thing which is making social 
justice compatible with the aggressiveness of the industrial and 
commercial mechanism. Today, we and the Germans are thinking 
about nothing else. 
  [Daniel] Are you brave enough to say which social benefits 
should be suppressed? What blockages should we clear? Which 
myths no longer correspond to reality? 
  [Rocard] Let us identify each separate case. I will start 
with pensions. When I was prime minister I issued a white paper 
which clearly listed all the threats to the long-term 
development of pension schemes. This white paper also listed 
all the possible measures for improving the situation and ended 
by concluding that this is such a weighty problem that it is 
impossible to leave it solely to the discretion of the state. 
On such complex problems, with such a big an impact on the 
future, the state should hold a public debate and not decide on 
the behalf of society. 
  [Daniel] However, there appears to be no other way.... 
  [Rocard] There is the method of multilevel negotiation which 
takes a long time. In France we are incredibly lucky in that we 
have the time. After all, no other European country has 
produced as many children, and as a result our retirement crisis 
will come in 2005 or 2010. That gives us two or three years to 
awaken the collective consciousness of the country and create a 
climate such that nobody can deny the figures. We have to get 
used to the idea that it will be difficult -- we have to study, 
research, and then negotiate. I did say, in a doubtless 
unfortunate joke: "That is enough to bring down any 
government." The press really made the most of that. Mr. 
Balladur, however, has quietly passed three decrees on 
retirement, and it did not bring the government down. Perhaps I 
should have kept my mouth shut? No, because the measures taken 
by Mr. Balladur are unfair and unsuited. They do not take into 
account the complexities of the different schemes and 
situations. In this way, the fantastic progress made in 
medicine above all benefits the better-off. A senior manager in 
France lives on average nine years longer than a construction 
worker. Twenty years ago this difference was less. Therefore, 
we must adapt the duration and maybe even the rate of 
contributions to adjust those imbalances. 
  Another example is sickness. For 40 years, France has been 
trying to run a system that is unique in the world, namely 
maintaining a health system providing good guarantees for 
everyone and especially for the deprived of our society, while 
leaving the sufferer completely free to choose his doctor and 
leaving the doctor completely free to choose the treatment. 
However, the system has gone off the rails and now ensures a 
guaranteed income for a certain number of specialists and a 
relative number of pharmacists at the expense of general 
practitioners. 
  This is not solely a financial problem: It is also a human 
problem. Only once in 40 years have we tried to negotiate with 
each medical profession instead of globally. That was when I 
was prime minister and Claude Evin was social affairs minister. 
We obtained the agreement of the anesthetists, analysis 
laboratories, and private clinics -- and started talks with the 
physiotherapists -- to set a limit on annual social security 
spending on each type of activity. We agreed on sanctions if 
budgets were exceeded. We now know that these measures had a 
favorable effect on the social security budget. However, 
instead of continuing along these same lines, [Social Affairs 
Minister] Simone Veil returned to mass interprofessional 
bargaining with all the medical professions taken as a whole, 
which has never led anywhere. I am pessimistic in this respect. 
In the absence of any spirit of group responsibility among the 
medical professions I feel that we are heading for some 
hard-hitting legislation. 
  A third example is education. Who could be crazy enough to 
believe that schools should be developed against the will of the 
teachers? Clearly, there are many technical and budgetary 
difficulties -- I know something about it, since I raised the 
education budget from 200 billion French francs [Fr] to Fr280 
billion. 
  [Daniel] What did you do with that money? 
  [Rocard] Half of it went on wholly justified pay rises for 
teachers. We cannot put our children's future into the hands of 
a body of people who are underpaid compared with other civil 
servants. The costly revaluation was necessary. However, I did 
not invest enough in the renewal of teaching itself. There were 
stumbling blocks.... However, everything is not as catastrophic 
as certain people claim. You have to realize that in 1974 over 
300,000 children left the education system with no 
qualifications or diplomas at all, whereas now this figure has 
fallen to just 100,000. That is not bad! 
  [Daniel] Put your enthusiasm into context! The number of 
failures at school has fallen, but the level of schooling has 
not improved.... 
  [Rocard] Of course it has! The bac [French high school 
diploma] was perhaps harder when I took it, but there were just 
a few thousand of us, an infinitely small, privileged minority 
of the population, and we were ignoramuses compared with the 
high school students of 1880! Today, with over 2 million 
students, the average level has risen considerably! However, I 
am still convinced that France needs a vast program of 
pedagogical innovation. Men and women of talent are mobilizing 
around this idea with unimaginable devotion! They have a 
considerable role to play in training which affects employment 
which in turn affects exclusion which affects delinquency which 
affects social cohesion, etc. Everything is concerned by this. 
  [Daniel] You have just given three major examples. At this 
point in your thinking, what is your priority? 
  [Rocard] We have smashed all our illusions. We now have to 
forge hope. For me the hope of democratic socialism is vital 
since, as I have said, it covers a whole plan for society.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Andreatta, Draskovic Meet"] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 16 Feb (ANSA) -- Foreign Minister Beniamino 
Andreatta, who met with Serb opposition leader Vuk Draskovic in 
Rome this afternoon, warned the warring factions in 
ex-Yugoslavia to "avoid making errors" because NATO's threat to 
bomb Serb positions around Sarajevo was real. "They had better 
understand in Belgrade that this time the international 
community is determined," said Andreatta, who acknowledged that 
Draskovic did not see eye to eye with Italy on the threatened 
air strikes, but that the meeting had been useful. 
  Draskovic leads the strongest opposition party in Belgrade's 
parliament, called the Party of Serbian Renewal. He told ANSA 
today that a NATO military strike would be a "very serious 
mistake, and could signal the beginning of a disaster for the 
Balkans, and perhaps for all of Europe. I have never spared my 
criticisms of Radovan Karadzic and the other Bosnian Serb 
extremists," Draskovic said, "but if NATO planes bombard them, I 
would have to take their side." 
  But he warned the Bosnians Serbs that "there is no choice," 
Sarajevo "must be unblocked." He said he hoped "they are aware 
of the necessity to withdraw from their positions," if they 
"don't want to be held responsible for further massacres." 
  He also said he did not think the Serb ultranationalists 
would carry through on their threats to take reprisals against 
Italy in the event of an air strike. 
  (In another context tonight, Italian Prime Minister Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi, at a press conference with foreign journalists, 
said that "while Italy is exposed geographically to reprisals, 
we don't believe this danger is real." 
  He said he felt Italy was protected not only by the NATO 
European defense network, but also by the fact "that we don't 
think there will be any reprisals coming from the other side of 
the Adriatic.") 
  Andreatta, speaking after today's meeting with Draskovic, 
said he thought that the European Union would take up the 
problem of the air strike in a scheduled meeting at the 
beginning of next week (and not in an emergency meeting before 
the Sunday deadline, as had been rumored.) "By now the question 
is in the hands of the UN, not the EU," Andreatta said. 
  Italy's diplomatic chief said he told his Serbian 
interlocutor that "once this initiative has been put in motion, 
it can only be stopped when the Bosnian Serbs have the good 
sense to withdraw their artillery or give it over to the UN." 
  "It's not even a question of saving face, it's just a 
question of guaranteeing that the people of Sarajevo no longer 
get blown up by these weapons," Andreatta said. 
  Although he and Draskovic did not see eye to eye on the 
ultimatum, Andreatta said he "admired" the Serb opposition 
figure's "judgment" and his desire "to bring Serbia back to its 
place among the European nations." 
  The Serb opposition leader said he believed the moment was 
exceptionally good for a negotiated settlement, because "people 
in all three camps are weary of fighting" and their chiefs "are 
incapable of rallying the forces needed for their respective 
armies." 
  But a NATO strike would call everything into question, he 
said, allowing "the Albanians of the Kosovo to feel encouraged 
about proclaiming their own state while the Turks might decide 
to join the fray alongside the Muslims," the Serbian MP said. 
"And the Russians? Who can rule out their intervening?" he 
added. 
  Draskovic said he didn't think the stalemate would continue 
until NATO actually dropped bombs. The Bosnian Serbs would 
withdraw their heavy weapons to 20km from the capital, he 
believes, "especially if they have UN and NATO guarantees that 
the Muslims won't take advantage of their withdrawal to move in 
their militias."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pope Receives First Israeli </F>
`Ambassador'"] 
  [Text] Vatican City, 10 Feb (ANSA) -- Pope John Paul II 
today granted a private audience to Shmuel Hadas [name as 
received], the first "special representative of the State of 
Israel to the Holy See." Hadas, who has the rank but not the 
recognition of ambassador, is the first Israeli diplomat 
accredited to the Holy See and his appointment is the result of 
the agreement last December 30 for mutual recognition, but not 
yet full official, diplomatic relations. 
  The visit by the Israeli diplomat, observers pointed out, 
was 
one of courtesy given that he has yet to present letters of 
accreditation. This, they added, explained why there were not 
official addresses and official Vatican sources did not comment 
on the event. 
  Born in Argentina of Polish parents, in 1931, Shmuel Hadas 
is 
married with two children. He emigrated to Israel in 1954 and 
has held diplomatic posts in Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia and 
Spain. He has also represented Israel at several international 
forums, included the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE). 
  In related developments today, the official Vatican 
spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, voiced satisfaction for the latest 
positive developments in the negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). 
  It is the position of the Holy See, he recalled, to favor, 
in 
the Middle East as elsewhere else in the world, negotiations 
which lead to solutions which respect the rights of men and 
peoples, including Israel's right to security and the right of 
Palestinians for a state.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Elections: `U.S. Impartial,' </F>
Napolitano Says"] 
  [Text] Washington, 10 Feb (ANSA) -- United States officials 
are impartial with regard to Italy's coming general elections, 
according to visiting Italian House Speaker Giorgio Napolitano 
in Washington Thursday [10 February]. 
  Over a two-day period, Wednesday and Thursday, Napolitano 
has 
met with his U.S. counterpart Thomas Foley; with the chairman of 
the house foreign affairs committee, Lee Hamilton; with former 
national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinsky; with the State 
Department's director for European Affairs, Stephen Oxman and 
with the head of the International Monetary Fund, Michael 
Camdessus. 
  Napolitano said he received the distinct impression that 
while American authorities took a keen interest in Italian 
affairs, they were determined to remain impartial with regard to 
the various political forces in play in Italy today. Americans 
are seeking to get a better handle on the envisioned government 
prospects of the Democratic Party of the Left (the former 
Communist Party), the evolution of the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] neofascist party as led by Gianfranco Fini, and the 
entrance onto the political scene of media mogul Silvio 
Berlusconi, who they are quick to liken to Ross Perot, he said. 
  With regard to the Left Democrats, Napolitano stressed that 
they were interested in pursuing the policy of recovery and 
reconstruction launched by the present Ciampi government. 
  However, Napolitano would not be drawn into making any 
guesses as to the outcome of the March general elections, 
insisting that the results were unpredictable, although he was 
fairly certain that the toughest and most innovative of the 
Ciampi government's policies would be continued. Italians are 
demanding renewal and recovery, he added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Andreatta and Berlusconi Clash </F>
Swords"] 
  [Text] Rome, 14 Feb (ANSA) -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta and media baron and political hopeful Silvio 
Berlusconi clashed swords and exchanged insults today over the 
electoral accord between Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy) 
and the rightist National Alliance, headed by the neofascist 
Italian Social Movement (MSI). 
  In an interview published at weekend, Andreatta, a Christian 
Democrat, warned Berlusconi of the risk presented by an 
electoral pact with the National Alliance. "I don't think Mr. 
Berlusconi wants to play the role of Italy's Zhirinovskiy" he 
said, adding how such an accord with the Right "would be 
interpreted by the press and foreign governments as a most 
dangerous sign of a 180-degree shift in Italy's foreign policy 
and its international position." 
  In a reply to Andreatta's statements, Berlusconi today 
issued 
a statement in which he said "Instead of letting Italy's voice 
be heard on the massacre in Bosnia, Andreatta is concerned with 
letting the voice of his party be heard to attack, with an 
uncivil and electoral tone, political opponents, seeking to 
slander them in Italy and the world." 
  "In regards to his statements that I could be compared to 
the 
Russian demagogue Zhirinovsky, an authoritarian post-Communist 
leader who has transformed himself into a liberal-democrat" the 
Forza Italia leader continued, "I can reply only in the most 
clear and obvious way: specialists in these kinds of 
transformations are the old and new friends of Minister 
Andreatta, the ex-communists who are wooed and cuddled by the 
Christian Democrat Left, not by me." 
  Berlusconi went on to say how "My foreign policy, which will 
be amply illustrated during the presentation of the Forza Italia 
platform, is clearly European and firmly loyal to the historic 
roots of the Atlantic Alliance. Anything else is small and 
petty electoral propaganda, narrow-mindedness I would have 
expected from the editor of L'UNITA (the daily of the Democratic 
Party of the Left) and some of his zealous opinionists, not from 
the chief of the Foreign Ministry, the most delicate ministry in 
the government which should speak in the name of all citizens 
and not just some of them." 
  Foreign Minister Andreatta was quick to reply to the Forza 
Italia leader and, in turn, issued a statement in which he 
argued "there is only one point in Mr. Berlusconi's rude reply 
which merits being underscored: the total lack of any reply to 
my question, as well as those by the foreign press, like THE 
TIMES and HERALD TRIBUNE, on whether he felt is was more or less 
compatible to have an alliance with those who support `historic 
rights' over Istria and other territories." 
  "Mr. Berlusconi" Andreatta continued, "spoke instead about 
other things. It's time he began to say something a little more 
articulated than his television commercials, possibly without 
having to wait for a new show to present his electoral platform." 
  The question of "historic rights" were those being 
championed 
by the MSI regarding the peninsula of Istria and the borders set 
between Italy and the then Yugoslavia after World War II. 
  Andreatta had argued at the weekend how "the word `historic' 
is an explosive expression in the mouth of any nationalist and 
in Europe could provoke the same unease as that produced by the 
German neo-Nazis when they speak of German Sudetenland or 
Silesia." 
  Vladimir Zhirinovsky is the head of Russia's so-called 
Liberal Democratic Party who put in a strong showing in the 
recent general elections and who has alarmed observers in the 
West with his visions for a Greater Russia, his threats to 
employ weapons of mass destruction and support for Serb 
extremists.

  [Text] Rome, 15 Feb (ANSA) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro met here this morning with TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi 
in his function as leader of the Forza Italia (Go Italy) 
political movement for talks that Berlusconi described later as 
"very cordial." 
  He said that, in the 75-minute conversation, he had 
primarily 
described how the new moderately conservative political grouping 
had been created and what had been done to draw lists of 
candidates with a good chance of beating the progressives. 
  Berlusconi also admitted that he had talked to Scalfaro 
about 
his brother Paolo's judicial problems thanks to allegations that 
he paid kickbacks to sell real estate. "I informed him of my 
assessment of the fact and the situation," said Berlusconi. 
  Berlusconi also said that moderate conservatives such as the 
ex-Christian Democrats of the People's Party and Pact for Italy 
would create "uncertainty" in the voters by claiming to stand 
for the bloc of moderate opinion known as the Centre in the old 
political system. 
  "They are putting themselves in a position that is difficult 
to explain to the people," he said adding that they face defeat 
unless they say which side they are on. He also defended his 
electoral alliance with the Northern League and the extreme 
rightists of the Italian Social Movement. 
  In other remarks, Berlusconi maintained his potential 
candidacy as prime minister.

Directa Poll"] 
  [Text] Rome, 11 Feb (ANSA) -- Two out of three Italians 
have not yet decided what party they will vote for in the March 
27 elections, according to a Directa poll of 1,210 telephone 
interviews in 92 municipalities nationwide. 
  The poll results, released Friday [11 February], showed that 
67.6 percent of those interviewed replied "no" when asked if 
they had decided which party they will support, while only 32.4 
percent said they had. The highest percentage of undecided was 
among women between the ages of 35 and 54, fluctuating between 
73 and 75 percent in different municipalities. 
  "The results show a high level of confusion among Italian 
voters and allow us to affirm undeniably that the percentages of 
support attributed to various parties or alliances are totally 
unreliable because, by referring to only one third of the 
electorate, they are scientifically unfounded," Directa stated, 
referring to polls that claimed Go Italy [Forza Italia], led by 
entrepreneur Paolo Berlusconi, topped the ratings with 24 
percent. 
  The number of undecided voters, Directa said, was the 
highest 
reported in the last 15 years just six weeks away from elections.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi and Forza Italia in </F>
Ancona"] 
  [Text] Ancona, 12 Feb (ANSA) -- A call to battle to shrink 
Italy's public sector, plow savings into development, reorganize 
public services and taxes, and, in the more immediate future, 
beat the progressive coalition led by the former Communists of 
the Democratic Party of the Left in the March 27 general 
elections was sounded today by Forza Italia leader Silvio 
Berlusconi. At a rally of his Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement 
in this Adriatic port city, the entrepreneur who parlayed real 
estate into a publishing and television empire looked first to 
the contest at the polls. 
  "The men of the left were convinced they had won, that they 
were the assigned rulers," he said with the gains of the 
progressives in two-tier municipal elections around the nation 
in November and December last year. "But when you scratch under 
the paint, you find the state-ism and manager-ism of always." 
  A victory of the left next month, Berlusconi insisted, would 
spell "disaster for economic freedom" because of an ideology 
"rejected by history," though these progressives now "mumble 
liberalism. We cannot resign ourselves to the fact of a 
minority taking the government of the country in hand and taking 
it on the dangerous path of recession," he declared to an 
assembly of some 1,000 Forza Italian supporters here. He went 
on to promise a crusade waged "with new men... without personal 
attacks on the adversaries" and one pursued to "relaunch the 
economy...and maintain jobs and create new ones." On the 
maneuvers afoot for the formation of alliances and coalitions 
ahead of the elections, the new face on the political scene 
said, "For whole nights I looked at the ceiling with my chest 
swollen with anxiety" before deciding not to go it alone. 
  The day after formalizing an alliance with the insurgent 
Northern League, plus two center-right splinter groups orphaned 
by the collapse of the Christian Democratic Party and others, 
Berlusconi said that despite the "coarseness" of the League, 
this movement "has provided a great contribution. 
  "They too have understood that the time of succession has 
passed and now is the time for construction and government 
responsibilities. With our moderation and balance, we will be 
able to start up positive cooperation," declared the Forza 
Italia leader. 
  After noting that the new majority electoral law works in 
favor of alliances and coalitions, Berlusconi discussed his 
"technical" agreement with the recently-formed National Alliance 
on the far-right. He noted that the National Alliance mainstay, 
the neofascist MSI [Italian Social Movement], captured nearly 50 
percent of the mayoral vote in Rome and Naples at the end of 
last year. The MSI, "a party always left in the ghetto, outside 
the democratic span," has "taken many steps forward and I am now 
convinced of their liberal and democratic ideas," he insisted 
with reference to the party which traces its lineage directly to 
dictator Benito Mussolini's rump Republic of Salo. 
  He went on to sweep in the other groupings "extending 
cooperation," the Democratic Christian Center and the Centrist 
Union plus areas of Mario Segni's Pact for Italy. 
  Shared by Forza Italia and the Democratic Christian Center, 
he said, are "the inspiring principles of the Catholic tradition 
and culture, the irrevocable values of family, life, solidarity 
and justice. It is right to use their valid support." 
  On his platform, Berlusconi emphasized the need to put the 
public sector "on a diet," overhaul the fiscal administration 
and apply a ceiling on fiscal pressure and reorganize public 
services "of low quality" which now penalize the weakest sectors 
of the population. On law and order, he declared, "There is a 
high percentage of murders and thefts which go unpunished. The 
first and fundamental duty of the state is to assure safety and 
security for its citizens," he added. 
  At the end of last month, Berlusconi handed to his deputy 
the 
chair of his Fininvest financial holding company, Italy's second 
largest private enterprise after the Fiat group, to begin 
campaigning full time at the head of his Forza Italia movement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Democratic Party of the Left </F>
Conference on Justice"] 
  [Text] Rome, 12 Feb (ANSA) -- The problems of the 
administration of justice in Italy and the need for reform were 
cited today as an essential premise for the political and 
institutional renewal the nation so sorely needs in a message 
sent to the conference, "Ideas for a Justice Program", by the 
head of the Democratic Party of the Left, Achille Occhetto. 
  In his statement for the conference, sponsored by the 
dominant party of the left, Occhetto said his party's platform 
for the March 27 general elections includes a commitment to 
"guarantee the independence" of the nation's judiciary and 
individual magistrates and "the speedy and efficient working of 
the justice administration." 
  Against the backdrop of the sweeping business and political 
corruption investigations which toppled the old political order, 
discussion here ranged over the latest developments in these 
probes and the prospect of applying "a political solution" to 
heal the myriad wounds opened by investigators and the courts 
and on to the issue of magistrates as candidates for election. 
  Opening the assembly, Senator Massimo Brutti took up the 
sensitive "political solution" issue and called for speeding up 
procedures to bring these cases to trial. On the prospect of 
extending the use of plea bargaining, the senator said a limit 
would have to be set on the enlargement of this practice and 
that plea bargaining should not lead to preferential treatment 
for crimes committed against the public administration. 
  Taking a broader view of the justice administration, Brutti, 
who heads the Democratic Party of the Left justice office, 
proposed "innovative measures" to apply to the criminal justice 
system in the near future: the establishment of "district 
courts" to handle Mafia trials; allowing appeals court justices 
to sit on the bench at lower court hearings; reducing the number 
of judges hearing criminal cases from three to one, expect for 
"district court" trials. This latter step, said the senator, 
would immediately free from 600 to 700 judges to begin attacking 
colossal backlogs. 
  Among the recent developments in Milan's Clean Hands 
investigations under scrutiny here were the arrest yesterday of 
businessman Paolo Berlusconi, the brother of entrepreneur Silvio 
Berlusconi who is now a political powerhouse at the helm of his 
Forza Italia (Go Italy) center-right movement, and the naming of 
Massimo D'Alema, Occhetto's deputy at the Democratic Party of 
the Left, as the alleged recipient of a kickback. 
  Senator Cesare Salvi, a member of the party leadership, said 
on the Berlusconi case, "It would not be correct to comment if 
one doesn't know the briefs." He went on to urge the political 
parties, coalitions, movements and groupings heading into the 
March vote to refrain from using the findings of investigators 
in their campaigns and called on the magistrates "to be very 
careful and cautious." 
  In comment on Tiziana Parenti, a Milan assistant public 
prosecutor who broke with the Clean Hands team last year and is 
now a Forza Italia candidate for parliament, Salvi noted that 
she, "like all other citizens, has a right to run" but added the 
caveat, "It is not right to use notoriety gained in 
investigations and trials." 
  On the advisory warrant issued yesterday to inform Giovanni 
De Piccoli, a member of the European Parliament for the 
Democratic Party of the Left, that he is under investigation, 
Brutti told reporters on the sidelines that he could not comment 
because he had not been informed of the "text of the measure." 
The senator also said he was skeptical about the allegation 
levelled against D'Alema. He said he had "serious doubts" about 
the entire affair because D'Alema is a front-rank political 
figure who has never been close to the procedures cited. He 
also dismissed the notion of "a faction led by Massimo D'Alema" 
as pure fantasy. This faction, according to the jailed former 
deputy chairman of a Fiat group construction company, Cogefar 
Impresit's Antonio Mosconi, received an illegal political party 
contribution.

<F P=106> [Report by Enrico Marro: "Luigi Abete: Vademecum for the </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Luigi Abete asked journalists: "Have you 
understood anything? I have not." A month and a half from the 
general election of 27 March and the situation is more confused 
than ever, emphasized the Confindustria [General Confederation 
of Italian Industry] chairman. "I have heard many slogans and 
read many statements, but people are not talking about 
programs." The political forces are thinking solely of 
alliances. So what can an association like Confindustria, which 
defines itself as being "nongovernmental" and "nonparty," do to 
make its own "contribution" to the preelectoral debate? It can 
try to force the electoral alignments to reveal their ideas on 
the main themes of political and economic debate. 
  Confindustria tried to do this in December with the 
"decalogue," a document listing 10 demands on the parties 
concerning taxation, privatization, the market, and 
institutional reform, among other things. "However," explained 
Abete, "since nobody has replied officially, we had to come up 
with the answers ourselves." Thus was born a "vademecum for the 
elections," a 40-page document entitled "A Policy For 
Development." 
  Confindustria does not take sides. There is too much 
confusion inside the opposing poles, noted its president. Abete 
then posed the questions and provided his own answers. He also 
touched on the burning issues. Thus, on the question of radio 
and television he says: "[state-owned TV company] RAI must be 
scaled down and so should Fininvest, in order to promote the 
plurality of the managers." He adds, however, that this scaling 
down must "begin with the RAI and safeguard the investments made 
by private companies over the years." 
  He asked the progressives, who range from the Democratic 
Alliance [AD] to the Communist Renewal and the Democratic Party 
of the Left [PDS]: What is your position on working hours and 
property tax? The industrialists stress that unemployment has 
risen in every country where working hours have been cut. 
Confindustria is also opposed to any form of property tax: "It 
already exists for companies, households pay it in a thousand 
and one different ways, and it is unthinkable to apply it to 
treasury bills. From the center-right alignment ([Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi and [League Secretary] Bossi), Abete asked 
for clarification with regard to "economic compatibilities." He 
said: "If we want to continue to clean up public finances, then 
taxation cannot fall by 1 percent a year, as Professor Antonio 
Martino (an economist in Berlusconi's ranks -- CORRIERE DELLA 
SERA editor's note) has said." In short, no demagogy. According 
to Confindustria, taxes can be cut by one half point a year at 
most. 
  Abete also asked [Italian Popular Party, PRI, Secretary] 
Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni's center group if 
they were ready to "complete the electoral reforms." 
Confindustria maintains that we must arrive at what is 
effectively a bipolar system through a two-round voting system 
or the direct election of the prime minister or the president of 
the republic. According to Abete, Martinazzoli and Segni cannot 
contemplate being the linchpin while possibly retaining the old 
conservatism. From the right wing [National Alliance leader] 
Fini, Abete asked for guarantees with respect to European 
integration and the markets. Finally, he invited people from 
all alignments to indicate their candidates for the post of 
prime minister before the election.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ciriaco De Mita, Italian Popular Party </F>
member, by Paulo Franchi in Rome; date not given: "It Is Not 
Enough To Step Back"] 
  [Excerpts] "Certainly I would not feel that I had a role to 
play in a Popular Party which was to lose its identity in an 
indistinct political mass like the Pact for Italy, and I would 
take the consequences. But this seems to me obvious, not 
sensational." That is it. Ciriaco De Mita is following, from 
home, by telephone, the fight for power between [Pact for Italy 
leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PRI, Secretary] 
Martinazzoli. He knows that there is talk of a statement by the 
secretary saying that there is no problem of his standing as a 
candidate. But on this matter he does not want to say anything 
more. Just as he does not want to comment on the concatenation 
of curious coincidences of recent weeks, after announcing in an 
interview with LA REPUBBLICA his decision to return to frontline 
politics: First of all, the vague announcements from Turin 
about his being under investigation, then the chorus of `no's' 
against his standing as a candidate, coming also from shores 
quite distant from the Popular Party and the Pact.... Nothing. 
Who knows whether out of vice or virtue, De Mita is insisting 
even in the darkest day. On speaking about politics. Sorry, 
talking logically about it. 
  [Franchi] What, Mr. De Mita? Your constant intellectual 
pride? 
  [De Mita] Certainly not pride. Maybe I have all the limits 
and virtues of the self-taught person. I claim to have been one 
of the first to point to the profound reasons for the corruption 
of the democratic system, and also to have attempted to organize 
a response. We have deceived ourselves into thinking that it is 
enough to pitch the right against the left with the new 
electoral law. Now we are finding out that the problem is 
infinitely more complex. They are struggling in each of the 
three poles with equally important questions: replacement [of 
discredited politicians and parties], new faces. But these are 
questions which cannot be answered without a general political 
framework of reference. 
  [Franchi] What does this mean for the Popular Party? 
  [De Mita] I have shared Martinazzoli's choice of solitude, 
in 
the conviction that the following legislature needs to be a 
constituent legislature,and that the important thing will be to 
be there, to put across our ideas. But I fear that the choice 
of solitude is transforming itself into a choice of absence 
which, you understand, is something else, and that the right is 
increasingly taking shape, and in forms not seen before. 
  [Franchi] Are you talking of [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi's party? 
  [De Mita] I have one question to ask them: How far have they 
contributed to convincing people that politics is not a question 
of guiding processes, but of offering a product, according to 
commercial rules? And why are those who have depicted this idea 
as an extraordinary positive novelty then surprised that the 
bravest in this domain has entered the field? [passage omitted] 
  [Franchi] This is how we settled the accounts with the 
immediate past? But we are still far from today's crisis. 
  [De Mita] I confess: In recent weeks I assumed the victory 
of the left to be inevitable. Now I am much less convinced. 
The Italian left has reasoned for a long time like the high 
jumper convinced that it did not have to win because the 
adversary was placing the bar far too high: the international 
restrictions, the agreement to exclude. Today this has all 
gone. The athlete has put on his running shoes, but he no 
longer seems to know in which discipline to compete. In 
particular when the shattering of politics and institutions has 
rendered an authoritarian solution plausible. 
  [Franchi] You have been very much a member of this country's 
ruling classes. Does it seem normal to you to blame others for 
our mistakes? 
  [De Mita] I do not blame anything on anyone, and I believe 
that I have enormous responsibilities. I know that pointing out 
other people's responsibilities, or taking on one's own, is no 
longer enough. The old ruling class can step back, but this is 
not enough to resolve the principal problem, which is not yet 
that of who should administer power, but of creating the 
institutional conditions for exercising it. 
  [Franchi] And who should take on all this? 
  [DE Mita] I ought to reply: Everyone and nobody, because it 
was given only to the Eternal Father to create the world from 
nothing. But I am also convinced that in Italy there is a great 
market for democracy and that if people quitting the ranks, it 
is because of an absence of supply. And hence the need to 
organize this supply. I believe the time has come for the 
press, the major newspapers, to discuss what they are doing, 
their national role, what it means to form a public opinion in a 
civilized country. It is the same crisis as the one which the 
parties are facing, that of their ability to organize consensus, 
to place the problem on the agenda. A high circulation is not 
everything. The parties too, as long as they had votes, 
believed that their representativeness and their influence were 
intact. And eternal.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Electoral Accord Nearing in Centre, </F>
Reached on Left"] 
  [Text] Rome, 15 Feb (ANSA) -- The so-called centre pole of 
the (renamed-Christian Democrat) People's Party and former 
Christian Democrat reform leader Mario Segni's Pact for Italy 
today smoothed some of their differences on electoral candidates 
and announced that an accord would be in place "by tomorrow at 
the latest." 
  On the left, the Left Democrat-led progressive front 
announced agreement on candidates -- with the Greens, in 
particular, saying their demands had been fully met -- and the 
Left Democrats unveiled a government programme to "rebuild 
Italy" via job-creation-through-growth, "fairer" taxes, a 
further reform of the electoral system to introduce a double 
ballot and facilitate "a clear choice of parliamentary majority 
and premier," and the attribution to local government of "all 
the functions not expressly given to central government." 
  The 32-page programme of the Left Democrats thus made 
important concessions to regionalist urges by envisaging "tax 
autonomy" for local and regional governments. It also proposed 
the transformation of one of the two houses of parliament into a 
regional assembly. Expressly ruling out one of the fears raised 
by the right, it said there would be no tax on Treasury bonds 
(BOTs). 
  After the electoral accord on the right between the Northern 
League and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy) in 
northern Italy and between the latter and the far-right National 
Alliance in the rest of the country, the centre thus remains the 
one "pole" still to agree on candidates. 
  Segni indicated this evening that he would not be pressing 
for a veto on some candidates who have been seen as too closely 
identified with past political ways, by saying that he would 
only issue an "overall" judgement on the People's Party lists. 
  People's Party leader Mino Martinazzoli rejected the view 
that the two centrist forces had been on the verge of breaking 
apart, saying that "if demands are not too excessive and there 
is an awareness of the political validity of the accord, things 
can be sorted out." 
  The deadline for naming candidates is tomorrow; the deadline 
for presenting them is Monday [21 February] -- provided that 250 
signatures are collected for each candidate.

<F P=106> [Article by Mario Monti: "True Solidarity"] </F>
  [Text] At a time when there are cries and recriminations on 
the unemployment problem, an "Informative Note on The Problems 
of Employment and Development," distrisbuted yesterday by the 
Office of Social Problems and Labor of the Italian Episcopal 
Conference (CEI), deserves particular attention. This document 
sheds light on the two most serious aspects of Italian 
unemployment, and clearly indicates suitable policies for 
tackling this problem. 
  In our country this problem is particularly serious because 
unemployment is concentrated in the south and among young people 
(thus, it strikes the youth of the south very hard). 
  The document observes, "The rate of unemployment in central 
northern Italy is no greater than the level in the former West 
Germany (8 percent), and in the north it can be compared to the 
more modest unemployment level in the USA (6.7 percent). On the 
other hand, in the south, unemployment is now 18 percent. Apart 
from certain regional or short-lived situations, the problem of 
unemployment in Italy is, therefore, essentially a problem of 
the south and its unsuccessful development." Thus, "the work, 
which should be shared in order to redistribute jobs, is 
unfortunately concentrated in the north. In the south there is 
still a need to build factories (and not only this, of course)." 
  As far as the structure of unemployment by age and family 
background is concerned, the document notes (even though data 
from 1991 are used) that only 12 percent of the unemployed are 
heads of families, versus an average of 37 percent in Europe. On 
the other hand, 63 percent of the unemployed are children versus 
an average of 38 percent in Europe. From the results of another 
recent study among industrialized countries, Italy (at almost 30 
percent) is second only to Spain for the percentage of young 
people between 15 and 24 who are looking for work without 
results. 
  The Informative Note of the CEI succinctly, but clearly, 
moves from the analysis of the data to a diagnosis: "These are 
specific characteristics that are linked to a labor market 
situation that is particularly closed and protected, with rules 
that primarily defend those who already have a job." 
  The document then moves from diagnosis to therapy. To get 
out 
of the crisis, in the short term it is necessary "to implement 
measures meant to make labor market rules more open, coordinated 
and flexible." In the medium term it is also necessary to 
provide for "a better balance when locating industries by 
transferring some of them to the south" and through a "massive 
basic investment process." 
  With regard to the situation pointed out in the Note, the 
unemployment problem in Italy is certainly destined to worsen in 
the future. There are three reasons for this. 
  First of all, the recession. According to the CEI, this is a 
recession that, in terms of unemployment, is affecting the 
service sector more than the industrial sector to which 
observers have preferred to turn their attention. Secondly, 
privatization; it may be good for the country, but, 
unfortunately, may eliminate redundant jobs. Thirdly is the fact 
that economic growth and job creation are moving in any case 
from Europe to America and Asia, and this is also due to the 
greater flexibility of those labor markets. 
  For the very reason that the problem is destined to get 
worse, the therapy suggested by the document is even more 
essential. 
  The employment emergency is burdened by the suffering of 
individuals and society. But fighting to keep nonproductive jobs 
alive is an act that smacks of solidarity, and that morally 
gratifies those who take part in it because they do not realize 
that they are hurting those who are even weaker--the unemployed. 
These are individuals, and particularly young people, that will 
not be able to find work because the economy allocates resources 
to dead-end projects rather than the creation of productive 
jobs. Social welfare measures are possible and appropriate, but 
they should be well-defined, and not involve nonproductive work. 
The conclusion of the CEI Note should also be noted: "Going in 
all these directions means making a fundamental choice to favor 
future (and collective future) investments in the short term 
over immediate (and individual) consumption. When taking into 
consideration the current state of public finances, this also 
means that it will be essential for social consciousness to 
prevail over demagoguery in the lively debate regarding taxes 
which is currently taking place in our country among 
politicians." I have felt it necessary to go into detail on the 
CEI's "Informative Note" due to the importance of imposing (as a 
sensible economic and social policy program) a vision based on 
flexibility and development on a tradition of thought and 
teaching that frequently is inclined to favor collective 
solidarity over growth. One wonders if, in the very terms 
proposed in this document, it may not be possible to develop a 
program that is quite similar to the one that I tried to outline 
on several occasions in this column (in particular on September 
3, 1993 and January 5th): 

  -  it should defer the reduction of 
the tax burden to a time when a substantial new equilibrium in 
public finances has occurred, and in particular, when the 
current deficit has been eliminated 
  -  it should also liberalize 
labor markets and, at the same time, better regulate them 
  -  there 
should be more public involvement to protect competition and 
openness, and less government interference in price and supply 
decisions 
  -  there should also be more flexibility (including 
regional) regarding wages and salaries, fewer restrictions on 
hirings and firings, and more room for decentralized and 
individual bargaining 
  -  unemployment offices should be eliminated 
and unemployment subsidies introduced 
  -  there should be fewer 
taxes on production, but fewer subsidies to businesses, less 
recourse to bailout measures, and more recourse to letting 
companies fail 
  -  furthermore there should be less protection for 
low productivity, and more care given to human and environmental 
"capital." 
  An economic policy along these lines would have the 
disadvantage (or the advantage?) of being neither "progressive" 
nor "moderate." It would simply be radical.

<F P=106> [Luis R. Aizpeolea report: "Fraga Asks Gonzalez for Overall </F>
Pact To Complete Implementation of Autonomy"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The autonomy battle is reaching fever 
pitch again. While Catalonia and the Basque Country are in 
favor of developing a bilateral relationship with the central 
government, other communities are aiming at an overall agreement 
in order to complete the implementation of autonomy. Galician 
government Premier Manuel Fraga (People's Party) proposed the 
latter option -- a national pact with the participation of all 
the communities -- to Felipe Gonzalez at the Moncloa Palace 
yesterday. 
  Fraga's stance is similar to that of Socialist Manuel 
Chaves, 
the Andalusia premier, who a week ago criticized the boost to 
autonomy in some communities, referring to Catalonia and the 
Basque Country, and proposed to Felipe Gonzalez that the 
implementation of autonomy be completed in a balanced manner for 
all regions. Gonzalez has shown himself receptive to these 
proposals, according to what Fraga stated yesterday, following a 
meeting lasting over an hour with the prime minister. 
  The similar proposals made by the Galician and Andalusian 
premiers assume major political importance by being put forward 
after the central government offered the Basque government a 
package of 20 transfers [of areas of responsibility] and on the 
eve of Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] Premier Jordi 
Pujol's meeting with Felipe Gonzalez in order to secure a 
breakthrough in autonomy for Catalonia. 
  Both the Catalan Generalitat and the Basque government want 
to maintain bilateral relations with the state, but the Galician 
premier, in harmony with the stance upheld by Chaves a week ago, 
showed his rejection of that course yesterday. "We do not 
believe in a bilateral negotiation between the central 
government and an autonomous government. My administration's 
proposal never casts doubt on the idea that the formulas are 
valid for all the autonomous communities. Now that there is an 
agreement for the `slow track' autonomous communities, as 
enshrined in the 1982 autonomy pacts, and agreement that another 
pact must be reached for the municipalities, this is the time to 
reach a major national agreement in order to complete the 
implementation of autonomy," Fraga said yesterday. 
<H5>  Single Administration </H5>
  The Xunta [Galician autonomous government] premier also 
confirmed that he will send his single administration proposal, 
which will be contained in a white paper, to the prime minister 
and to the premiers of the 17 autonomous communities. 
  Yesterday Fraga demanded from Gonzalez a package of 
transfers 
-- the Social Institute of the Navy, the material resources of 
the administration of justice, vocational training, the National 
Employment Institute, the ports of general interest, and the 
libraries. 
  Gonzalez and Fraga examined the problems of the dairy sector 
in his community. The head of government proposed to Fraga that 
the 10 billion peseta fine for milk surpluses in Galicia during 
the past farming year be renegotiated with the Agriculture 
Ministry and the European Commission. 
  The understanding between Gonzalez and Fraga on an issue 
that 
concerns the government as much as the configuration of the 
state was "tremendously important," according to the Xunta 
premier. Fraga gave Gonzalez a helping hand by stating that he 
finds no power vacuum, in clear contradiction with the 
assertions by the previous day by Rodrigo Rato, his party's 
parliamentary spokesman.

<F P=106> [Luis R. Aizpeolea and Anabel Diez report: "Government Will </F>
Take Aznar Into Account To Make New `Turnabout in Autonomy'"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The government intends to take the 
People's Party and its leader, Jose Maria Aznar, into account in 
order to carry through the turnabout in autonomy in the 
fast-track autonomous communities -- the Basque Country, 
Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia. The government believes that 
although the People's Party is in power in only one of those 
four communities -- Galicia -- an agreement with the leading 
opposition party is absolutely necessary because the new impetus 
to autonomy affects the state's territorial configuration. 
  Specifically, the government is contemplating transferring 
exclusive state powers to the autonomous communities by the 
delegation procedure envisaged in Article 150, paragraph 2 of 
the Constitution. These would include the administration of 
social security and the National Employment Institute (INEM). 
  In fact, the government has already taken the People's Party 
into account in all the steps which it has taken to configure 
Spain territorially since in February 1992 Felipe Gonzalez and 
Jose Maria Aznar signed the autonomy pacts in order to raise the 
slow-track autonomous communities' ceiling of powers. Recently, 
the two parties have also agreed on the setting up of a 
autonomous communities general committee in the Senate. 
<H5>  Surprise </H5>
  Generalitat [Catalan autonomous community] premier Jordi 
Pujol's proposal of a pact with the throne is viewed with some 
surprise by the central government, but excessive importance is 
notattached to it. "It is one of so many drafts which Jordi 
Pujol could put forward. At the moment of truth, he will 
undertake a realistic negotiation of new powers, as has happened 
on other occasions," government sources state. 
  To the same effect, the government's reaction is not to back 
down from its pledge to carry through the turnabout in autonomy, 
despite the proposal put forward by Pujol. "The government has 
an election pledge to give the fast-track autonomous communities 
new powers, and it will fulfill it," the sources consulted add. 
  However, the same sources deem the negotiating process with 
the Basque government a good deal more complicated that that 
with the Catalan Generalitat. In their opinion, the Basque 
Nationalist Party is immersed in a preliminary election campaign 
for the autonomous community elections in the fall, and this 
will make it very difficult to conduct a rational negotiating 
process. However, the situation in Catalonia is very different. 
"Jordi Pujol wishes to wrap the turnabout in autonomy in a 
spectacular format," according to the sources consulted. 
  Officially, the government maintains that it will give no 
official opinion on the Generalitat's document until it receives 
it, as Miguel Gil, the government spokesperson's secretary 
general, stated yesterday, adding that for the present there is 
no date for the next meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the Basque </F>
autonomous government, by Jose Luis Barberia; place and date not 
given: "Jose Antonio Ardanza"] 
  [Text] San Sebastian--The question whether the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party] has substantially modified its "line" has 
reemerged in conjunction with all the furor stirred up in recent 
weeks by combative public statements from party spokespersons. 
  [Barberia] What's happened to make your party, the PNV, 
harden its line lately? 
  [Ardanza] My party has not changed its line, but after seven 
years in which not a single statutory transfer [to the regional 
autonomous government] was implemented, we are really tired of 
waiting, and we find it intolerable that the socialist party 
continues tinkering endlessly with obligatory, mandated 
legislation such as the Statute of Guernica, which was endorsed 
in a referendum. 
  [Barberia] Isn't it true that the underlying basis of all 
the 
polemics is the breakdown of negotiations on the general budget 
bill and PNV's participation in the Madrid government? 
  [Ardanza] After seven years it seemed only reasonable that 
the PNV should get rapid progress on autonomy, at a time when it 
was being asked to make larger commitments and was even offered 
the possibility of participation in a hypothetical coalition 
government. But the socialists' response was to say there would 
be no movement on autonomy legislation until the PNV promises 
this will be the last demand. In other words, they want us to 
renounce our nationalist ideology, to yield to their cynical 
attempts at blackmail. 
  [Barberia] More than the issue of suspended transfers per 
se, 
what the central government and the PSOE [Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party] seem to reject is the PNV's interpretation of 
some of these reforms. 
  [Ardanza] During those seven years, we told the socialists 
again and again that we were prepared, on these pending matters, 
to accept the interpretations they themselves made back in 1979, 
when they asked the Basque people to vote for the law. The 
response, equally cynical, has been that that interpretation is 
obsolete. Under the circumstances, it seems to me the PNV has 
shown ample restraint and moderation. 
  [Barberia] As the highest official in the [Basque] 
autonomous 
community, do you think it proper and politically prudent to 
say, as spokesmen for your party have been quoted recently, that 
the king should not rely on bayonets alone, that the monarch 
gave a "humorous" talk, that the army is an obstacle to 
self-determination, and that the Civil Guard is a loathsome 
apparatus? 
  [Ardanza] Look, I'm not going to get into making specific 
judgments about what people have said or not said. What 
surprises me is the scandal people are trying to make of it. 
What is scandalous in my own opinion is that the Civil Guard 
have set up humiliating roadblocks everywhere, that they 
mistreat a mayor in full view of his own townspeople, throw him 
down on the ground, kick him and hold him with his arms crossed 
for two full hours. There comes a time when you have to say: 
"This has got to stop." I'm not going to deny that some people, 
myself included, may have spoken too harshly on occasion; what 
surprises me, though, is that they should spend an hour in a 
press conference denouncing what after all was only a single 
sentence. 
  [Barberia] And what do you have to say about the debate on 
self-determination, all the references to the Ulster accord? 
  [Ardanza] We weren't the ones to raise that issue. We have 
other priorities, other urgent issues, such as progress on 
autonomy and above all recession and unemployment. But what 
happens? Well, we are constantly raked over the coals and 
besieged with demands to take a position on that issue. And we 
are Basque nationalists! For us, self-determination is a 
legitimate right, recognized by international bodies. So why is 
it so scandalous? Why is it that this and other subjects are 
considered taboo here in Spain? Is it because Spain's democracy 
is not fully established and normalized? Truly, one begins to 
have doubts, when all it takes to stir up an immediate scandal 
is to say something about the army. 
  [Barberia] Do you think these polemics are artificial--in 
other words, that there's an element of hypocrisy here? 
  [Ardanza] What I believe is this: There are lots of 
conjuring 
tricks going on here, since at the same time both of Spain's 
largest political parties have lost their ideological moorings, 
or so it seems. In the last analysis, one has the impression 
that the socialist party is just a machine that exists to 
perpetuate itself in government and parcel out power. The crisis 
in the PSOE today--and it is one of the state's biggest 
problems--has nothing to do with ideology: It's all about the 
allocation and control of power. 
  [Barberia] As the description of a political party, that's a 
fairly harsh judgment.... 
  [Ardanza] They vacillate between frontal opposition and 
compromise, depending--as far as I can tell--on changes in the 
opinion polls. I'm not saying it's not legitimate, but I think 
that's how it is. 
  [Barberia] Is there any justification for the comparisons 
being made between the "Irish case" and the so-called Basque 
problem? 
  [Ardanza] All I can say is, it's worth reflecting on the 
method chosen by the governments of two democratic countries, 
the United Kingdom and Ireland, to deal with a political 
conflict that has lasted more than 70 years. They signed a 
document in which they acknowledged that the road to peace is 
based on the right of the inhabitants of Ulster to 
self-determination. And this I know: No one there was 
scandalized by the proposal that the Ulsterites decide, 
democratically, whether they want to continue as a province of 
the United Kingdom or become a part of the Republic of Ireland. 
Ulster is not in Africa, neither is it a colony; it's in Europe, 
quite close to us. 
  [Barberia] Leaders of your party have alluded to possible 
Civil Guard opposition to deployment of the Ertzaintza [Basque 
Autonomous Police] in Guipuzcoa, while spokesmen for the 
government have said the presence of Ertzaintza will not mean 
reduced deployments of other security forces. Do we have here 
the germ of a new conflict? 
  [Ardanza] No. We continue to rely on the parliamentary 
accords and the agreements signed between the [Interior] 
Ministry and the Basque department of interior. 
  [Barberia] What is your opinion of the personnel shake-ups 
in 
Interior and the changes Asuncion seems to want to introduce in 
the struggle against terrorism? 
  [Ardanza] Asuncion has assured us categorically that nothing 
is changed. We'll just have to wait and see. 
  [Barberia] Not even respecting the PNV's erstwhile contacts 
with ETA-HB [Basque Fatherland and Liberty Group/Herri Batasuna]? 
  [Ardanza] I rely on the minister's own words, when he 
attested to the necessity of our collaboration. But the mistake 
was to formulate a political proposal. The state cannot avoid 
the obligation it has to democratic nationalists to fully 
implement the requisite legislation, which, I repeat, is 
mandatory and was offered to violent extremists in exchange for 
a truce. That is a violation of the Ajuria Enea pact. 
  [Barberia] Do you think the hopes once vested in the 
so-called Azkoiti track have come to naught? Are we sure they 
don't know who's now in charge of the ETA? 
  [Ardanza] I share the impression that ETA no longer has a 
nucleus capable of getting the entire organization to move in a 
particular direction. As to the first question, I cannot speak 
of failures or successes in absolute terms. These are processes 
whose effectiveness can only be determined after the problem is 
overcome. 
  [Barberia] The last elections substantially altered the 
Basque political landscape. Do you view the advances made by 
nonnationalist Basque parties as temporary, or are they 
indicative of a putative withering away of nationalist supremacy? 
  [Ardanza] It's not very scientific to build whole theories 
on 
the results of a handful of electoral races.

<F P=106> [Interview with Catalan Premier Jordi Pujol by Carlos Elordi </F>
in Barcelona; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Elordi] Judging by the 
latest reports, you would say that the Catalans now virtually 
want independence.... 
  [Pujol] Over and above the spectacular reports, I have 
always put the problem in virtually identical terms, and I have 
been working for the same things for 40 years. And so I say 
that Spain is a multinational, multilingual, and multicultural 
state. Inside that Spain, Catalonia is a nation, with its own 
language, culture, historical awareness, and traditional 
institutions. All that we ask is that this fact be acknowledged. 
  [Elordi] But you have also said that Catalonia is like 
Slovenia. 
  [Pujol] Yes, but I also added that Spain is not Yugoslavia. 
Slovenia was also inside a multinational state, but a very 
artificial and recent one. Spain's unity has now lasted for 
centuries, and Spain has been able, much more than Yugoslavia, 
to create a kind of "common home" for the peoples comprising it. 
That is, even though Slovenia is a nation like Catalonia, the 
solution to Catalonia's problems will come not through secession 
but by organizing Spain in such a way that the country's 
multinational nature is respected. 
  [Elordi] And for you the time has come to make a 
considerable leap forward in order to achieve this.... 
  [Pujol] This is not exactly the case. The fact is that our 
autonomy statute and the Spanish Constitution were conceived 15 
years ago in a very different manner from what, in a very 
reductionist way, has since been applied, and it is that 
reductionism which we wish to change. 
  [Elordi] Is this the "turnabout in autonomy" which you are 
demanding of Felipe Gonzalez in order to continue to support his 
government? 
  [Pujol] It is not I who spoke of a "turnabout." I do not 
like this word, because it has too demanding a ring. All that 
we wish to do is to negotiate two things with the Socialists: 
On the one hand, a substantial change in economic policy -- 
something that we have achieved in the past few months -- and, 
on the other, making the same interpretation of the statute and 
the Constitution that was made when the two documents were 
promulgated and which was much more generous than that which is 
now being made. I am convinced that there is scope for all our 
demands within the Spanish Constitution. 
  [Elordi] On one occasion you recalled the situation which 
existed before 1714, when the Catalan Government dealt directly 
with the king of Spain. Would that be the solution to the 
current problems? 
  [Pujol] I do not believe that we can return to before 1714, 
but I am convinced that Catalonia's autonomy must be political 
-- not just administrative. If I recalled that historical 
situation, it was in order to emphasize the political content of 
our demands for greater autonomy. The problem is not a direct 
relationship with the king but creating a structure which will 
acknowledge, without limits, Spain's multinational reality. 
  [Elordi] Could not that "more generous" interpretation of 
the Constitution place Spain's poorer regions at a disadvantage? 
  [Pujol] I frankly do not believe so. In Spain there is an 
economic solidarity between the regions, and we want it to 
continue. We can argue about the amounts which the country's 
richer areas should contribute to the less developed areas. We 
can also argue about the way in which this process is applied 
right now in order to avert the dangers which it could entail 
for the development of the regions with a higher level of 
prosperity. These are arguments similar to those which occur in 
Italy, but perhaps we have done things better here, and I 
believe that they are less serious in this matter than in Italy. 
The situation is more balanced. There is a problem in this 
respect, but not a drama. 
  [Elordi] To what extent have the difficulties now 
threatening the process of European unity, of that "Europe of 
the peoples" in which an autonomous Catalonia would have found 
its own place, revived the tension between Barcelona and Madrid? 
  [Pujol] We Catalan nationalists have always been 
pro-European, and in the past we were the only people who 
maintained that stance. Europe has been part of the Catalan 
identity for centuries: Catalonia originated as part of the 
Carolingian empire, and our capital was not Toledo but Aachen. 
We have always wished to form part of Europe -- not of a 
somewhat sidelined periphery -- but the Catalan nation's 
political problems must be resolved in Madrid -- not Brussels. 
This has always been the case. 
  [Elordi] What will the Catalan nationalists do if Madrid 
does not accept their demands? 
  [Pujol] I do not share the feeling of tension which some 
people are creating in this respect. We wish to negotiate 
peacefully the recognition of our rights, and it must not be 
forgotten that many very important laws approved by the current 
government over the past few months exist not because they had 
the backing of any master of Spanish patriotism but thanks to 
the Catalan nationalists' support.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Strafford: "The Economic Pain in Spain"] </F>
  [Text] After several years of growing self-confidence in 
the late 1980s, culminating in the festivities of 1992, when it 
celebrated the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's 
discovery of the New World, Spain is suffering from a hangover. 
It is not alone in this, at a time of recession in Europe. But 
economic difficulties are hitting the Spanish particularly hard, 
with, for instance, an estimated 23 per cent or more unemployed. 
  At the same time the socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez 
has been weakened politically. The socialist party (PSOE) 
emerged as the winner in last June's general election, in spite 
of expectations that it would be overtaken by the conservative 
Partido Popular (PP) [People's Party], but it lost the overall 
majority in parliament it had held since 1982. 
  Senor Gonzalez tried to form a coalition with two 
nationalist 
parties, Convergencia i Unio (CiU) [Convergence and Union] of 
Catalonia and the Partido Nacional Vasco (PNV) [Basque National 
Party] of the Basque country, with which he would have commanded 
a permanent majority, but this proved impossible. So he now 
heads a minority government which needs to win support from 
elsewhere for each of its legislative measures. 
  For the parties of the opposition, all this implies that 
after being in power for nearly 12 years, the socialists are 
approaching the end of the line. Jose Maria Aznar, leader of 
the PP, told THE TIMES that though in the end his party had not 
won last Junes election, it had increased its votes from 
5,200,000 to 8,200,000. It made its appeal to the young, 
particularly professionals and townspeople in general, and was a 
clear alternative to the socialists. 
  Inaki Anasagasti, parliamentary leader of the PNV, talked of 
"the end of an epoch," and said that Senor Gonzalez, the 
towering figure in Spanish politics since 1982, was "tired." 
  This is not the way the socialists see it, however, and, 
faced with an admittedly difficult situation, they are fighting 
back confidently. Narcis Serra, the deputy prime minister, who 
is himself a Catalan, said there were signs that Spain was 
emerging from recession. "Statistics for the second half of 
1993 show a change in the trend," he told THE TIMES. "There 
won't be a sudden change for the better, but we are slowly 
getting out." 
  Spanish companies were improving their profits, Senor Serra 
said, interest rates were still going down, and the favourable 
exchange rate for the peseta, after three devaluations, was 
helping the growth of exports. If other European countries 
picked up, so would Spain. 
  Senor Serra conceded that having only a minority government 
made things more difficult, but claimed that the results so far 
were "not bad." The government had received the support of the 
CiU and the PNV for austerity measures in the budget for 1994, 
adopted last autumn; and this was followed by an overwhelming 
parliamentary majority last month, including the PP, for an 
important series of reforms to the laws on employment. 
  Other reforms were either under way or planned, Senor Serra 
said, with two overall aims: to allow companies to become more 
competitive without reducing the number of employees, and to 
adjust the Spanish labour market to wider European conditions. 
  The underlying question is whether the government will have 
the will, and the political muscle, not just to pull Spain out 
of recession, but to carry through some fundamental reforms that 
are thought to be needed if the Spanish economy is to become 
competitive in the European Union. Since democracy returned to 
Spain after the death of General Franco in 1975, the overriding 
aim of all Spanish governments has been to overcome the 
backwardness and isolation the country had known for many years; 
and with the rapid growth of the 1980s there were hopes of 
achieving that. 
  The onset of recession has revealed continuing weaknesses, 
however, and steps have been taken to address them. One was the 
rigidity of the employment laws, some not so different from 
those of the Franco era. The new legislation is designed to 
improve that by, for instance, allowing for part-time 
employment, and the taking on of young people as apprentices at 
lower wage levels, and in general making it easier to hire and 
fire. 
  For the moment, difficulties have been crowding in on the 
socialists thick and fast. In December, Promocion Social de 
Viviendas, a housing cooperative run by the Union General de 
Trabajadores (UGT) [General Workers Union], the big socialist 
trade union confederation, collapsed; and this was followed by 
the near-collapse of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), Spain's 
fourth-largest bank, leading to the dismissal of its board by 
the Bank of Spain and the appointment of a new team. 
  On January 27, the UGT and the Comisiones Obreras [Workers 
Commissions], the other main union confederation, called a 
one-day general strike in protest against the new employment 
legislation. 
  The strike slowed Spain down for a day, but it is not 
expected to deter the government from its reform policies. It 
reflected the differences between a socialist government that 
has long been one of the most pragmatic and market-orientated in 
Europe and its former supporters in the unions. These 
differences are still being fought out inside the PSOE, where 
Senor Gonzalez has tried to shake off the influence of the left, 
and will come to a head at a party congress next month. 
  In the background is the age-old tension between Madrid and 
the Spanish regions, whose most extreme manifestation is the 
continuing, though weakened, terrorist campaign by Euskadi Ta 
Askatasuna (ETA) [Basque Homeland and Liberty], the Basque 
independence movement. The fact that the government is dependent 
on support from the CiU and the PNV in parliament has given 
moderate Catalan and Basque nationalists a greater degree of 
leverage. Both parties are basically in sympathy with the 
current reform moves, but have been pressing for the granting of 
greater autonomous powers in return. 
  At Catalan insistence, a new arrangement for the funding of 
the regions was agreed last autumn. This did not help the 
Basques, however, and both Miquel Roca, parliamentary leader of 
the CiU, and Senor Anasagasti want more. The Madrid government, 
they say, has still not fully carried out the terms of their 
original autonomy statutes, dating back to 1979. 
  There are significant differences between the Catalans, more 
numerous and prosperous, and the Basques. Senor Roca points out 
emphatically that the CiU is not a separatist party, and 
sometimes gives the impression that the party's aim is, far from 
secession from Spain, rather influence over the whole country. 
  Senor Anasagasti, on the other hand, caused a storm last 
month by publicly protesting against a speech by King Juan 
Carlos, made before a military audience, in which he made an 
oblique, and mild, reference to regional differences. "The 
diversity which enriches us," the King said, "must unite us 
rather than separate us." 
  By tradition, statements by the King are not publicly 
criticised in Spain, but Senor Anasagasti said that the speech 
had been "neither balanced nor just," and this was followed by 
fiery statements by other PNV leaders attacking the army and the 
Guardia Civil, the paramilitary police. 
  Senor Anasagasti said later that his objection was 
essentially to the audience before whom the King had spoken, 
since the position of the King should not be based just on 
"bayonets," but on the various constitutional bodies. He denied 
it, but the assumption in other parties is that the PNV was 
looking ahead to the regional election in the Basque Country 
this autumn, when it does not want to be outflanked by the 
extreme nationalists. 
  In its foreign policy, the Spanish government retains its 
belief in closer integration in the EU [European Union], based 
on the Maastricht Treaty and going beyond it. This is in spite 
of recent difficulties in the exchange rate mechanism, which led 
to the devaluations of the peseta, and the more general 
disenchantment with the integration process. 
  Spain has demonstrated its greater involvement in 
international affairs by sending troops to Bosnia, and taking 
part in other United Nations operations in Angola and 
Mozambique. Within the EU, it has pressed for more attention to 
be paid to future tensions in North Africa, with its growing 
populations and its political, religious and economic 
difficulties. 
  Officials concede that as a result of recent difficulties in 
the EU, and the recession, public enthusiasm for the process of 
European integration has waned in Spain. But Senor Serra says 
that enthusiasm would revive once the recession ended, and that 
Spain continues to believe in monetary union. "Europe has to 
deepen both its economic and its political union. That will 
give Spain a stronger position."

<F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Paul </F>
Schulmeister in Vienna on 17 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mock] I hope very much that, considering this 
serious ultimatum, Serbia, its representatives, and the Bosnian 
Serbs will realize after all that it makes no sense to start a 
military conflict and that they will withdraw the heavy weapons. 
  After all that has been resolved and promised in the past 
two 
years, I understand that there are doubts. However, one has to 
realize that the credibility of another organization, that is, 
NATO, will be very much jeopardized if a threat that was 
formulated in great detail and based on legitimate Security 
Council resolutions is not taken seriously. 
  [Schulmeister] What would this mean for Europe's security in 
the future? What would this mean, for example, for Austria's 
security? 
  [Mock] Security in general, already very much endangered 
today, would be further jeopardized. One would only have to 
wait for the next conflict of this kind to arise and Europe 
would again fall back into the chaos that occasionally existed 
in the past. Here I am thinking in particular of the 30's. 
  [Schulmeister] If this NATO ultimatum also proved to be an 
empty threat in the end, would this mean that Europe's security 
would be even more endangered in the future? 
  [Mock] It would be very bad for Europe's security and for 
us. The medium-sized and small countries in particular have to 
depend on the observation of legal rules. A very big state 
still can take comfort in the fact that it has nuclear weapons 
anyway, and things of that sort. Therefore, this would really 
be a major setback, from the moral point of view as well. What 
proclaims Europe is no longer respected. One has to expect that 
the bad example of aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia would be imitated elsewhere.

<F P=106> [Report by "E.M": "Austria Collects Signatures Against </F>
Temelin Nuclear Power Plant"] 
  [Text] The threat posed by the Czech nuclear power plant 
in Temelin near the border has lead to a response by the 
population: On the one hand, an advance notice of damages 
valued 3 trillion schillings has been sent from Austria to the 
U.S. company Westinghouse. On the other hand, the environmental 
organization Global 2000 is starting a large-scale petition 
campaign: It calls on the U.S. Congress to withhold financing 
of Temelin: "The nuclear power plant project has already been 
rejected by the World Bank and other banks with reference to 
cheaper and safer alternatives," the petition states: 
"Therefore, we are appealing to you not to support the 
short-term economic interests of the U.S. nuclear industry." 
  This campaign is supported by Education Minister Rudolf 
Scholten: "If signatures are collected in schools, I endorse 
that." The first prominent person to sign is [singer] Rainhard 
Fendrich. Lists for signatures can be obtained at Global 2000, 
1120 Vienna, Flurschuetzstrasse 13, telephone 0222/812 57 30. 
  Environmental activist Petr Hlobil of the Czech 
environmental 
organization Children of Earth believes that "the majority of 
the people in southern Bohemia are against the project." 
Organized resistance is already forming, according to Hlobil. 
Hlobil does not accept his government's argument that Temelin is 
necessary so that the outdated coal-fired power plants in 
northern Bohemia can be closed down. Until 1995-96 -- the 
earliest date of Temelin's coming into service -- most of the 
coal-fired power plants in the region will already have been 
closed down or improved. Only 430 of the 2,000 megawatts of 
Temelin will then be needed in northern Bohemia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Good Relations With Czech Republic"] </F>
  [Excerpt] After the cabinet meeting on Tuesday [15 
February], Chancellor Franz Vranitzky pointed out the 
good-neighborly relations with the Czech Republic and stressed 
that Austria's antinuclear course is neither directed against 
the Czech Republic nor against the government there. In 
Austria, the Greens allegedly demanded a special session of 
parliament on this issue. 
  Vranitzky indirectly referred to criticism by Czech Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus concerning Austrian efforts against 
Temelin, stating that it is true that the autonomous decision by 
the Czech Republic was in favor of nuclear power, but that there 
was great readiness for cooperation with Austria on this issue. 
  Thus, Vranitzky mentioned the commission of experts that was 
established to examine the Bohunice power plant and the 
opportunity that Austria was given to look at documents of other 
nuclear power plants and to inspect them. In addition, Austria 
made financial contributions to a number of studies on energy 
policy and ecological aspects. Austria's offer to supply free 
electricity worth 3.5 billion schillings in the event of a 
shutdown of Bohunice was rejected by the Czech Republic for 
reasons of principle. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by unidentified </F>
reporter after the cabinet meeting in Vienna on 15 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Unidentified reporter] The cabinet today 
discussed the Temelin nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic 
and the trip of a delegation of Austrian experts scheduled to 
arrive in the United States today. Chancellor Vranitzky 
described the task of the experts as follows: 
  [Vranitzky] The main job of the experts delegation is to 
explain in Washington that we believe that the coal power 
stations that contaminate the environment in the Czech Republic 
can be replaced by methods other than the construction of 
nuclear power plants. As is known, we have developed numerous 
concepts in this respect and have presented them to the Czechs. 
We were also prepared to offer financing and other forms of 
industrial cooperation. 
  It will also be important to point out in Washington that 
the 
Temelin nuclear power plant would not correspond to U.S. 
environmental standards. It is not yet clear whether our 
experts will be able to attend the hearing in Congress. 
However, this is not the most important thing. The most 
important thing for our experts is to talk with the advisers and 
the scientific staff of the congressmen and with the advisers 
and officials of the Exim bank during their stay, and to explain 
Austria's position there. These are the plans as far as the 
trip of the delegation to the United States is concerned. 
  Referring to the discussion in Austria that has been going 
on 
for several days, I would like to state the following: The 
discussion is mainly characterized by domestic aspects. There 
have been massive attacks and exaggerated demands -- above all, 
by Greens deputies. It seems obvious to me that the Greens have 
realized that a topic on which they may have liked to focus has 
been taken up by the government, that the government has adopted 
a clear position on the issue. This is the way I interpret 
things. Other similar statements can probably also be 
considered domestic politicking. 
  [Reporter] Does the fact that an Austrian bank mainly owned 
by the state has issued option bonds for stocks of a company 
that builds Temelin not make the mission in the United States 
more difficult? 
  [Vranitzky] A report from sources close to the Austrian 
People's Party brought up this matter. I can only state the 
following: According to information provided by the general 
manager of the Bank Austria, the bank was not involved in 
financing the Temelin power plant. It was invited by Citibank 
last year to participate in the large-scale international 
financing of the project, but declined to do so. As we all 
know, it has transpired that a subsidiary of Bank Austria 
offered option bonds. I have been assured that the management 
has in the meantime stopped this. The lie was spread that the 
manager of the Bank Austria, Randa, briefed me for weeks about 
Bank Austria's financial projects in connection with Temelin. 
This is simply a lie -- in two respects. First, the bank did 
not finance the Temelin power plant, and -- second -- this means 
that it was not possible to brief me on anything. I do not hold 
any position in this bank. Thus, this also belongs to the realm 
of domestic politicking, as mentioned earlier.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ben, re": "Strong Reactions to Temelin </F>
Affair"] 
  [Excerpt] Vienna, Salzburg -- The involvement of Bank 
Austria, or its subsidiary Investment Bank AG respectively, in 
the construction of the Czech nuclear power plant in Temelin 
prompted strong reactions over the weekend [12-13 February]. It 
has become known that as recently as in December 1993, the 
Investment Bank AG offered option bonds for the Czech energy 
concern CEZ, to which Temelin also belongs. This transaction 
was based on speculations about sizable profits if the 
state-owned U.S. Eximbank should guarantee loans worth billions 
for the completion of the Temelin power plant. The Investment 
Bank AG confirmed the existence of such option bonds during the 
weekend. 
  In addition, the information bulletin of the Federation of 
Self-Employed Businessmen No. 212 dated 7 February 1994 leveled 
the allegation that Bank Austria will assume a sizable portion 
of the credit guaranteed by the Eximbank. Chancellor Vranitzky 
was reportedly briefed by the manager of Bank Austria, Gerhard 
Randa. The information bulletin reads: "His (Vranitzky's) 
protest letter to the U.S. Senate is being dismissed as 
`Balkan-like behavior' in Washington because it is no secret 
there that Vranitzky has known for months about plans concerning 
a credit guarantee and that Bank Austria is playing a major role 
in this respect." 
  Vranitzky told APA [Austria Press Agency] on Saturday [12 
February] that he did not know Bank Austria wants to assume part 
of the loan for Temelin. He also denied reports he was briefed 
by manager Gerhard Randa. The chancellor also stated he would 
be very surprised if reports about Bank Austria's participation 
were correct. The city of Vienna owns approximately 53.1 
percent of the bank, the government owns 23.7 percent, the 
Wiener Staedtische insurance company owns 10 percent, and other 
shareholders own the rest. 
  In a radio interview on Saturday, the general manager of 
Bank 
Austria, Rene Alfons Haiden, denied reports about alleged 
credits by his institute. He confirmed that an international 
consortium approached his institute on this matter, but that 
Bank Austria rejected any participation. Asked about the option 
bonds, Haiden stated that if this information should be true, 
this would have consequences. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Austrian National Bank will reduce the discount 
and the Lombard rate by 0.25 percent each beginning of tomorrow. 
Thus, the new discount rate will be 5 percent, the Lombard rate 
6 percent. 
  This step is justifed by the "good liquidity" of the markets 
and the trust documented by the high reserves. It is also 
intended to support the beginning economic recovery, the 
Austrian National Bank announced. The Gomex rate remains 
unchanged at 5.5 percent. 
  Previously, the German Bundesbank had reduced its discount 
rate by 0.5 percent to 5.25 percent.

<F P=106> [Article signed R.F.: "Senate Cautiously Debates NATO </F>
Action in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- "I do not see any sense in what you are 
saying," said Foreign Minister Willy Claes yesterday at the 
start of his response to the question asked by Senator 
Francois-Xavier de Donnea regarding NATO action in Bosnia. 
Claes also talked about the speeches by some six other senators 
-- including Paul Pataer, Herman De Croo, Hugo Van Rompaey, and 
Nelly Maes -- who took part in the debate. 
  Generally speaking, the speeches contained a carefully 
worded 
positive reaction to the NATO ultimatum. However, the questions 
asked were primarily about the scope of the ultimatum and the 
role of the European Union. As for the future of the southern 
Slav region, a number of different voices could be heard. 
Pataer rejected an ethnic division. On the other, Van Rompaey 
and Maes stressed that the conflict between the peoples there is 
already centuries old. 
  Foreign Minister Willy Claes defended the role of the 
European Union in the conflict and also clarified the NATO 
ultimatum. He put the emphasis on the fact that "the creation 
of a new element following the failure of the latest 
negotiations in late December was inevitable." 
  He explained that "he wanted to see no introduction to a 
generalized military scenario" in the ultimatum. He did feel 
that the ultimatum must be carried out with the necessary 
strictness and that it must not be watered down on the ground. 
The ultimatum concerns only Sarajevo and the surrounding area, 
but can be broadened geographically if necessary. 
  Claes said that any such negotiated solution would not 
really 
be convincing without Russia and the United States. However, 
that does not mean that "Moscow should think that it has a say 
in determining the European Union's position." America must be 
involved in a solution because the Muslims in Sarajevo feel that 
only Washington can provide a convincing guarantee for a peace 
agreement. 
  Claes came down against lifting the arms embargo, because 
this would increase the risk of war for the UN troops and the 
neighboring countries, but also because "some countries, which 
are known for their support to fundamentalism and which are 
already active on the ground in Bosnia," would not hesitate to 
send advisers and mercenaries. 
  The minister finished by warning of a "mistaken vision of 
nationalism that can deteriorate into racism and egoism," but at 
the same time stressed that he "does not want return to the idea 
of the right to self-determination."

  [Text] The Belgian commissioner for refugees has refused 
right of asylum to the alleged ETA [Basque Fatherland and 
Liberty] collaborators Raquel Garcia Arranz and Luis Moreno 
Ramajo because this right cannot be recognized in a community 
country for any citizen of another member state of the European 
Union. As you will recall, when the Belgian commissioner 
decided last December to study the asylum application which has 
now been refused, the Spanish government expressed its 
categorical repudiation. 
  The commissioner for refugees bases his decision on the fact 
that right of asylum cannot be recognized in a community country 
for any citizen of another European country because human rights 
are respected throughout the European Union. In his decision he 
also indicates that in Spain ETA sympathizers are prosecuted 
only when they commit offenses and never for their ideological, 
religious, or ethnic convictions. 
  Luis Moreno Ramajo and Raquel Garcia Arranz, who are accused 
of collaborating with ETA's Vizcaya Commando, were released last 
December after spending six months in a Belgian prison. The 
court which decided their release took into account in its 
decision the fact that the Belgian commissioner for refugees, 
Marc Bossuyt, had agreed to the processing of the application 
for political asylum made by the two alleged ETA members, who 
claimed in their application that charges against them had been 
obtained by means of torture. 
  At that time the Belgian Government promised Spain that it 
would do everything possible in order that asylum might be 
refused to the two alleged ETA members and it gave guarantees 
that they would remain under surveillance to prevent them 
fleeing. Today's decision reopens the possibility of Spain 
obtaining the extradition of Moreno Ramajo and Raquel Garcia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Prince Philip Will Lead Delegation </F>
to Russia This Year"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- In November or December a Belgian trade 
delegation led by Prince Philip will visit the Russian Republic, 
announced the head of the Russian trade representation in 
Brussels. The visit was discussed during the recent visit by 
President Boris Yeltsin to Belgium. Consultations regarding the 
trade mission are being conducted with Foreign Trade Minister 
Robert Urbain. 
  According to Ivan D. Ivanov, the recently appointed head of 
the Russian trade representation for Belgium and Luxembourg, and 
previously a Russian negotiator with the European Union and 
GATT, exports to Russia from the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic 
Union [BLEU] rose by 20 percent last year, despite the fact that 
overall Russian imports were halved. 
  Only a few South East Asian countries came close to that 
performance. Ivanov expects that the cooperation agrement 
concluded in December will stimulate trade further. 
  According to him, Belgian traders are extremely active. In 
addition, those Russian companies which used to produce weapons 
of destruction and which are now attempting to switch their 
activities, enjoy being involved in the manufacture and 
distribution of consumer products. Until recently, Belgium 
exported primarily metal and outfitting equipment to Russia, but 
now it is also exporting an increasing amount of consumer 
products, such as dairy produce, and chocolate. Last year, the 
value of trade between the BLEU and Russia totalled 
approximately 50 billion Belgian francs. 
  Belgium also appears to be the major recipient of Russian 
investments abroad. There are something like 20 joint ventures 
under way here, some active on the local market, others actively 
producing items for export. The two countries have already 
concluded an agreement aimed at protecting their reciprocal 
investments. 
  According to Ivanov, the problem concerning the Russian debt 
to Belgium was solved last November by restructuring it. 
Belgian companies in Russia are still owed $150 million, 
because the Russian Government froze hard currency assets. 
These assets will now be liberated. 
  Russian trade representations abroad are no longer dependent 
on a form of state organization run from Moscow, but are 
operating, claims Ivanov, at the service of all Russian 
companies that are active on the foreign market. As a result, 
in the future, Belgian companies will be dealing directly with 
Russian companies. 
  Consequently, Belgian companies may refer to databases for 
information on Russian trade legislation and on the profile of 
Russian companies. Meanwhile, the representation in Brussels 
and the Belgian Department of Foreign Trade are currently 
drawing up a business guide for use by Russian companies and 
investors.

Mirage-5's"] 
  [Text] The Philippines are very interested in purchasing 20 
Belgian Mirage-5 fighter aircraft, according to BRTN 
[Dutch-speaking Belgian Television and Radio Broadcasting]. The 
negotiations are said to be in a relatively advanced stage, but 
for the time being nothing is known about the price to be paid 
by the Philippine Army. 
  When the Belgian Government agreed its medium-term 
purchasing 
plan for the Defense Ministry in the middle of last year, it 
immediately gave the green light for the sale of 20 Mirage-5 
aircraft. Sabca [Belgian Aeronautic Construction Company] was 
instructed to seek buyers. The aircraft had just been refitted 
when the government decided to slim down the Air Force. 
  At present they are deployed at the Weelde airbase. Before 
long the base will also station a number of F-16's which are 
also for sale. A number of countries have been contacted for 
this sale including Pakistan and NATO ally Greece. For the time 
being there has been no result here either.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Air Force Leaves Bierset"] </F>
  [Excerpt] This year the Air Force is to disband three large 
units. They are the third wing of the Bierset base (near Liege) 
and two logistical units. The operation is part of the Army 
restructuring plan which was approved in January 1992 by the 
government. 
  The Air Force will disband the third wing on 31 March and 
leave the base at the end of June. The Mirages have already 
been withdrawn from active service. Some weeks ago the Air 
Force flew the last aircraft of that type to the reserve base in 
Weelde (Antwerp) for storage. There they are waiting for a 
buyer. Sabca [Belgian Aeronautic Construction Company] was 
instructed to look for interested parties. Yesterday it emerged 
that the Philippines were a possible purchaser. 
  The facilities at Bierset will be transferred to the Army's 
light aircraft unit. It will become the base for the Agusta 
A109 helicopters and the Alouettes which have been brought back 
from bases in Germany. 
  This year, two of the Air Force's five logistical units will 
also disappear. Only the "maintenance," "communication," and 
"support" wings will remain on the Evere base. 
  The Air Force chief of staff announced yesterday that in the 
coming months 31 F-16s will also be transferred to Weelde. 
These planes are to be withdrawn from active service due to the 
cutbacks announced in July 1993. The Air Force also wants to 
sell these aircraft. One plane will be stationed in 
Saffraanberg (St. Truiden) and serve as teaching material. 
  The military training center in Koksijde will close in June 
due to the abolition of compulsory military service. The last 
conscripts will then receive their training in Florennes or 
Kleine Brogel, depending on their linguistic roles. The Defense 
Ministry will soon centralize the basic training of all Air 
Force personnel in Saffraanberg. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Politics Demands Threat Be Carried </F>
Out"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The West cannot hesitate about carrying 
out air strikes if Serbia refuses to place its heavy weapons 
under UN control by 0101 (Netherlands time) Monday morning [21 
February], said Minister Kooijmans (foreign affairs) and his 
colleague Mr. Ter Beek (defense) yesterday in the Second 
Chamber, which unanimously supported this government action. 
  "The threat of air strikes is a political means of applying 
pressure. Such a threat is only credible if it is carried out," 
said Kooijmans. According to Ter Beek, the air strikes will be 
limited to the area around Sarajevo. 
<H5>  Cancelled </H5>
  Neither Kooijmans nor Ter Beek said precisely when air 
strikes would begin. Ter Beek did cancel a planned working trip 
to Norway combined with a visit to the Olympic Games in 
Lillehammer. "I would have been back by Monday evening, but the 
ultimatum expires on Sunday evening, and I would have not been 
very calm there," said Ter Beek just before the beginning of the 
debate in the Chamber. 
  According to Kooijmans, the decision to deploy Netherlands 
F-16's in the air strikes was very tough for the government. 
  "The risks for the troops on the ground and civilian aid 
workers cannot be taken lightly." However, Kooijmans seemed to 
be only partly in agreement with Chamber members who said that 
the ultimatum appeared to be working: "There is insufficient 
progress. In addition, the Serb leaders are making 
contradictory statements. Milosevic and Karadzic are prepared to 
take steps, while some military leaders are not." 
<H5>  Guarded </H5>
  According to Kooijmans, the West cannot be satisfied with 
"monitoring" at a distance, for example with the help of radar. 
"That is not sufficient inspection." The heavy weapons taken 
over by the United Nations must be guarded by UN men, perhaps in 
a central location, before being destroyed. 
  Mr. De Hoop Schoffer (of the CDA [Christian Democratic 
Appeal]) called on the government to use the five days left 
before the ultimatum expires to exert a maximum amount of 
political pressure. He also asked the Second Chamber to be 
directly involved in every successive step. 
  Earlier in the day, Ter Beek stated that the United Nations' 
request for extra military personnel for the UN peacekeeping 
force in Bosnia was not directed at the Netherlands. The 
Netherlands will shortly have some 3,100 military personnel 
stationed in or in the area immediately around the former 
Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Newscaster Pia Dijkstra introduction of video report by </F>
correspondent Pieter Boonman, identified by screen caption, on 
Nelson Mandela's visit to the Netherlands; Mandela speaks in 
English with subtitles in Dutch--recorded] 
  [Text] [Dijkstra] ANC leader Nelson Mandela will leave 
behind for a few days now the political tension, the violence, 
and the election campaign in South Africa. He is in the 
Netherlands for two days for political talks and a for a special 
television program on the upcoming elections in April. 
  Despite the huge domestic problems, Nelson Mandela is 
optimistic about the forthcoming first-ever democratic 
elections. He does not rule out that the Inkatha movement also 
will participate, despite Inkatha leader Buthelezi's statements 
that ANC concessions for greater regional autonomy are not 
sufficient. 
  [Begin recording] [Boonman] Nelson Mandela arrived at the 
Hilversum television studio tonight for the taping of a special 
program. He does not want to discuss the difficult negotiations 
with the right-wing whites and the Zulu movement Inkatha. 
  [Unidentified reporter in English with Dutch subtitles] How 
important is a fund-raising evening for the ANC in the 
Netherlands? 
  [Mandela] Well, our visits to the Netherlands have always 
been crowned with success. 
  [Boonman] During the special program, money will be 
collected 
for election projects in South Africa. [end recording] 
  [Dijkstra] Mandela started his visit to the Netherlands with 
a luncheon at the Catshuis [prime minister's residence]. He 
spoke among others with Prime Minister Lubbers and Vice Prime 
Minister Kok. Yesterday in Johannesburg, the ANC leader made 
promises to the right-wing white organizations and to the 
Inkatha movement. He promised them a greater say in the future 
South Africa. Inkatha has rejected the offer, but Mandela 
remains optimistic. 
  [Begin recording] [Mandela] As far as my understanding of 
his 
[Buthelezi] comments, it does appear that he has left the door 
open if ANC clarifies the offers it has made. I therefore 
believe that it is premature for us to decide that he has 
rejected the offer. 
  [Boonman] Mandela does not rule greater autonomy in order to 
draw all parties to the elections. 
  [Mandela] In a case where you are trying to build a new 
country, there can be no final concession. Concessions are 
inherent in negotiations. 
  [Boonman] The Netherlands Government has assured Mr. Mandela 
that it would also assist the new South Africa with money. In 
an interview with Lubbers and Mandela to be broadcast later 
tonight on Nederland-3, Lubbers agrees to pay this price. 
  [Lubbers in English with Dutch subtitles] I would not 
exclude 
the possibility of supporting Mr. Mandela as a symbol, not only 
because of the elections, but also as a symbol to say: Let us 
set out a new course for the future. 
  [Boonman] Before he leaves tomorrow, Mr. Mandela will meet 
with Netherlands businessmen to persuade them to invest in South 
Africa. [end recording] 
  [Dijkstra] Tomorrow morning Nelson Mandela will also meet 
Yasir 'Arafat. The PLO leader arrives late today and will be 
received tomorrow by Prime Minister Lubbers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CPB Expects Stronger Growth in the </F>
Economy"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The Central Planning Office [CPB] is 
expecting economic growth of 2.5 percent for 1995. This is more 
than the average of 1.75 percent the political parties took into 
account when drawing up their election platforms. 
  The CPB has not yet made any calculations for 1996 and 
subsequent years. If economic growth is actually 2.5 percent, 
that would mean a windfall for the government finances of around 
10 billion guilders. 
  As a result of the high economic growth, the number of jobs 
will start rising again -- by 23,000 in 1995 -- following two 
years of reductions. Some of these will be part-time jobs, 
which means that next year an extra 54,000 people will be back 
at work. Wim Kok, who heads the electoral lists for the PvdA 
[Labor Party] confirmed yesterday evening during a speech in 
Leeuwarden that things are going somewhat better with the 
economy. For 1995, he is counting on economic growth of "more 
than 2 percent." According to Kok, higher economic growth gives 
those people entitled to benefits the prospect of receiving 
higher benefits, because if there is satisfactory growth there 
is no reason to freeze their benefits. The PvdA leader thought 
it foolish of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] to call for 
an advance freeze of the old-age pension over the next four 
years. "There is no reason for such a rigorous step," said Kok. 
He has the feeling that, "economically speaking, the worst is 
over." 
  At the Central Planning Office and the Ministry of the 
Economy and Finances there were warnings of "exaggerated 
optimism." The CPB's figures for 1995 are still early. They 
were sent to various ministries for comments. Experience shows 
that they can often subsequently undergo radical changes. The 
fact that the calculations this year were released so early is 
linked to the structural windfall of 18 billion guilders which 
the Finance Ministry reported yesterday in the so-called 
February Memo. As economic growth rises, the need for radical 
savings is not so great and the room for reducing taxes 
increases. The report on the anticipated figures comes too late 
for the five political parties, which had the CPB check their 
election programs. When making the calculations, the CPB starts 
out from an average annual economic growth of 1.75 percent. The 
CPB hopes to have completed the calculations by next Monday. 
  With annual economic growth of 2.5 percent, the maintenance 
of purchasing power for people at all income levels is back in 
sight -- taking account of miscellaneous claims which already 
rested on it (growth of the working population, incidental wage 
increases, reduction in the budget deficit, and the improvement 
of companies' profitability). Planned adjustments to the 
national budget and the social security system can, in this 
case, be scrapped or reduced drastically. The PvdA, which, 
according to the latest version of the election platform has 
plans for saving 8.8 billion guilders, will even have money left 
over with average economic growth of 2.5 percent. The debate in 
the Social and Economic Council (SER) on reducing the difference 
between gross wage costs and net wages (the wedge) by 15 billion 
guilders is now being looked at in a different light because of 
this burst of fair weather. Namely, these 15 billion guilders, 
as well as the 2.5 billion guilders which the SER wants to 
earmark exclusively for intensifying the structural 
reinforcement of government spending must be saved by cuts in 
the national budget and social security (employers' view) or 
higher energy taxes (employees' view).

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Britain is to send a 60-strong team of radar 
specialists to Bosnia and move up to 300 of the Coldstream 
Guards into the capital Sarajevo. 
  The Government move is a response to the United Nations 
request to help strengthen the peacekeeping operation in the 
Bosnian capital. 
  But Britain backed away from intense pressure to send a 
mechanised battalion of at least 700 men with armoured personnel 
carriers. 
  And in a thinly-veiled attack on the United States 
Administration, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said it was 
time that other countries made "helpful contributions." 
  He said that Britain, which has 2,400 troops on the ground, 
and France were the largest contributors to the UN operation in 
Bosnia. 
  "It would not be appropriate to think that the UK should 
shoulder the burden by itself," he said. "It would not be 
thought fair and reasonable by the British public." 
  Asked whether he would like to see the United States provide 
ground troops, he said: "It is important that all countries that 
can make an important contribution should seriously consider 
doing so. 
  "All of those countries interested in a successful 
resolution 
of this operation should realise it is not reasonable to expect 
the burden to fall only on a small number of countries. 
  "We hope that all countries that are able to assist will 
look 
positively at ways in which this can be done." 
  Two companies of the Coldstream Guards will be moved from 
their base in Vitez to Sarajevo to help monitor Serb heavy 
weapons. 
  A mortar-locating troop equipped with Cymbeline radar will 
be 
sent to Sarajevo along with an additional number of military 
liaison officers and observers. 
  The 60-strong troop will be able to pinpoint precisely the 
source of any mortars that are fired during the ceasefire. 
  However, Britain's response falls far short of the United 
Nations request for up to 3,000 troops, including two mechanised 
infantry battalions, six helicopters as well as specialised 
units. 
  The initiative came from Lieutenant General Sir Michael 
Rose, 
the UN commander in Bosnia, who needed the extra forces to 
monitor the Sarajevo ceasefire and control Serb heavy weapons. 
  He did not get all he wanted but Mr Rifkind today praised 
him 
on a "magnificent job" in achieving the longest ceasefire in 
Sarajevo since the conflict started two years ago. 
  "The action we are now taking will help to establish the 
ceasefire more firmly and, as we all hope, achieve the 
demilitarisation of Sarajevo," he said. NATO has threatened 
air strikes against any artillery or heavy weapons around the 
Bosnian capital unless they are withdrawn at least 12 miles from 
the city or surrendered to the United Nations by midnight on 
Sunday [20 February]. 
  Mr Rifkind will meet his American, French, Spanish, Italian 
and Dutch counterparts for urgent last-minute talks in Italy on 
Sunday -- just hours before the deadline expires. 
  It is expected that U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's 
aircraft will stop in Britain to pick up Mr Rifkind en route to 
the meeting, which will probably take place at NATO's southern 
region command headquarters in Naples. 
  The government was under intense pressure to provide more 
forces but their decision was made easier when the other allies 
-- France, Holland and Spain -- all said they had already sent 
the maximum possible. 
  Mr Rifkind said it was "encouraging" that some good progress 
had already been made with a number of Serb heavy weapons handed 
over to UN control. 
  "At the moment it is looking quite encouraging but there is 
still a long way to go," he said. 
  He was confident that Sir Michael would have the necessary 
number of troops in Sarajevo to monitor the heavy weapons. 
  Large numbers of French troops have already been pulled in 
from elsewhere in the region and the extra British troops will 
make a significant impact on the operation. 
  Sir Michael has made plain that Serb or Muslim troops 
attempting to win back control of their heavy weapons would have 
to "fight" for them. 
  Mr Rifkind said that in such a situation British troops 
would 
be fully entitled to defend themselves under the UN mandate. 
  The decision to send up to 300 Coldstream Guards to Sarajevo 
will inevitably limit the number of aid convoys that can be 
escorted through central Bosnia. 
  But Mr Rifkind stressed that other nations should be able to 
provide forces to help that operation.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Excerpt] A company of around 150 men from the Coldstream 
Guards was moving into Sarajevo today as the likelihood of NATO 
airstrikes receded. 
  The British troops will reinforce United Nations forces 
already in the Bosnian capital and help monitor the ceasefire 
and control Serb and Muslim heavy weapons. 
  The self-sufficient force, including engineer, logistics, 
anti-tank and mortar specialists, earlier left the UK base at 
Vitez in Warrior and other armoured fighting vehicles. 
  They will be joined shortly by a second company of 
Coldstream 
Guards, bringing the total deployment in Sarajevo to almost 300 
men. 
  Hopes were high that the Moscow initiative to send 400 
Russian troops to Sarajevo would persuade the Serbs to comply 
fully with the NATO ultimatum to withdraw or hand over control 
of their heavy weapons by midnight Sunday [20 February]. 
  Although the Bosnian Muslims and others have voiced concern 
about Russia's close relationship with the Serbs, they will not 
seek to prevent the move. 
  And Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind sought to calm fears 
about possible Russian bias towards the Serbs. 
  "Of course it is the case that Russia has a particular 
relationship with Serbia, but that also applies to other 
countries," he said. 
  Malaysia was very close to the Bosnian government, yet its 
troops were serving under the UN in the war zone. 
  "We all accept there will inevitably be old friendships, old 
ties, that have to be taken into account," said the Defence 
Secretary. 
  "The crucial point is that all forces in Bosnia come under 
the UN command." 
  The Russian decision has led to a significant withdrawal of 
heavy guns, with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic pledging 
that the war in Sarajevo was finally over. 
  The UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, said 
there was a "particular exodus" and he believed that people 
finally wanted peace. 
  The Russian move eased pressure on the Government, under 
attack for refusing to send an extra infantry battalion to 
Bosnia after Sir Michael appealed for 3,000 more troops. 
  Mr Rifkind again defended the Government's position, 
stressing that Britain had 2,500 troops in the region while 
other countries like the United States had no representation. 
  Sixty specialist mortar locating troops are due to leave 
Britain for Sarajevo tomorrow with morale sky-high. 
  Men from the 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery [RHA] at 
Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, will join colleagues from the 1st 
Regiment RHA from Tidworth, Hampshire. 
  They will take five sets of Cymbeline mortar locating radar 
systems, which will be able to detect the precise source of any 
shell fired in violation of the Sarajevo ceasefire. [passage

  [Text] Aid organisations were today urged to review the 
position of any British or international staff in Bosnia as the 
NATO deadline on air strikes approaches. 
  The Government request was seen by MP's as a suggestion that 
aid groups should pull out staff who could be vulnerable to 
retaliation if air strikes are ordered against heavy weapons 
around Sarajevo. 
  The Foreign Office said: "The Overseas Development 
Administration have advised these aid organisations to review 
whether they should keep any British or international staff in 
Bosnia. 
  "The advice points out that ODA personnel have been 
relocated 
in order to reduce the risks to them until the situation becomes 
clearer." 
  The Foreign Office also said: "Since September 1991, all 
British nationals have been advised to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
This advice remains in force. Those who, despite this advice, 
decide to stay do so at their own risk."

  [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds today pledged 
to take every chance to present a balanced view on the Downing 
Street declaration during a visit to the United States next 
month. 
  Speaking ahead of a meeting in London this weekend with John 
Major, he again highlighted hopes that their peace initiative 
would prompt a permanent end to Northern Ireland-linked 
terrorism. 
  Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he was still 
"cautiously optimistic" about the success prospects of the 
two-month-old joint declaration. 
  The Irish premier, who meets Mr Major before the two leaders 
attend Saturday's Twickenham rugby international between England 
and Ireland, said they would be reviewing recent Northern 
Ireland political developments. Northern Ireland Secretary Sir 
Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring -- joint 
chairmen of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference -- will 
also be at the talks. 
  Mr Reynolds said the meeting would focus primarily on issues 
connected with the peace declaration. "We will review progress, 
share assessments of the current position and examine approaches 
of attaining our common objective of a lasting peace with 
justice in Ireland." 
  He said the advancement of political dialogue through a 
resumed inter-party talks process would be discussed too. 
  Mr Reynolds refused to agree that Sinn Fein's annual 
conference at the end of this month would signal the deadline 
for its response to the peace bid. 
  Mr Reynolds is due to go to the U.S. for a period including 
St Patrick's Day, March 17, when he will meet President Clinton. 
He said he would "avail of every appropriate opportunity to 
present and promote in a balanced way the complexities of the 
Northern Ireland conflict, as well as our efforts towards its 
peaceful resolution. 
  "This will be of particular importance during my discussions 
with President Clinton and congressional leaders."

  [Excerpts] Paris, Feb 17 (AFP) -- The West is waiting for a 
definitive withdrawal of Bosnian Serb weapons from around 
Sarajevo after a Russian agreement with them to do so, the 
French Foreign Ministry said Thursday [17 February]. [passage 
omitted] 
  Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said here that Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev had contacted French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe informing him of the Russian deal, brokered 
by Moscow special envoy Vitaly Churkin. 
  "Mr. Kozyrev informed Mr. Juppe that Vitaly Churkin had 
obtained an agreement from the Bosnian Serbs that they withdraw 
their heavy arms," he said. 
  But he added: "We are waiting for this news to be confirmed 
and to be translated into actions on the ground." 
  "What we are looking for is an unambiguous application, 
within the deadline, of the decisions taken by NATO, that is the 
withdrawal, regrouping, and placement under UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] control of heavy weapons." 
  "The two sides, Serbs and Bosnians, must respect the demands 
made by NATO," he added. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Jacques Amalric commentary: "From Paris to Washington: </F>
Genesis of an Ultimatum"] 
  [Text] When on 5 February [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe 
and [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard learned of the tragedy 
on the Sarajevo market, they agreed that the indignation of 
Western public opinion should be used to make a last diplomatic 
and military attempt to involve the United States in the Bosnian 
issue once again. For some time, the idea of a withdrawal of 
the French contingent from Bosnia had been gaining ground in 
Paris. The fierce controversy which had just arisen between the 
French and Americans on the plan to partition Bosnia, supported 
by Paris but described as unjust and immoral by Washington, 
convinced many French officials that the war would be stepped up 
and that there would soon be no alternative but to withdraw the 
Blue Helmets if a repetition of the Lebanese fiasco was to be 
avoided. 
  The first stage in the operation launched by Juppe and 
Leotard -- two men who do not respect each other excessively but 
who nonetheless will overcome their feelings and work together 
-- is aimed at securing the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo 
before reopening negotiations. First, because the Bosnian 
capital has become a symbol over the 22 months in which is has 
been besieged by the Bosnian Serbs. Second, because France can 
no longer be suspected of only proposing to use force where it 
has no troops. 
  Paris remembers with some embarrassment the objections which 
were made last January at the NATO summit in Brussels to the 
French idea -- which was nonetheless accepted but has still not 
been implemented -- aimed at securing, by force if necessary, 
the reopening of Tuzla airport and the relief of the Blue 
Helmets stationed in Srebrenica: No French soldier is stationed 
near these two areas; it is the Swedish Blue Helmets, who have 
no heavy weapons, who are deployed in Tuzla, and Canadians who 
are to be relieved in Srebrenica by a Dutch contingent. 
  Once it was decided to no longer be paralyzed by the views 
of 
the French military hierarchy hostile, like most of the other 
Western military leaders, to air strikes which did not have the 
sole aim of helping Blue Helmets in difficulty, the foreign and 
defense ministers' aides asked the essential question: Is it 
better to go through the United Nations or NATO to carry through 
the French initiative? Francois Leotard was, for a time, in 
favor of the NATO solution, but it was finally not accepted: 
There was a fear that it would meet with excessively strong 
opposition, not only from the Greeks, who make no secret of 
their hostility to operations against the Serbs, even if they 
are Bosnian, but also from the British and Canadians who have 
strong reservations about exposing their contingents to possible 
reprisals. 
  Moreover, nobody was certain that the idea of going through 
NATO would have the -- vital -- approval of the Elysee or even 
that of the United States which, at the NATO summit, made every 
effort to ensure that the Atlantic Alliance is not seen as a 
machine with anti-Russian connotations. Did not Bill Clinton at 
the last minute reject the NATO membership applications 
presented by the Central European countries, only conceding to 
them the very vague status of a Partnership for Peace, after 
verifying that the Kremlin had no objection to that? 
  It is therefore the UN solution which was initially proposed 
by Alain Juppe to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
during a telephone conversation. The French minister proposed 
to his counterpart that a resolution should immediately be 
submitted to the Security Council demanding the lifting of the 
siege of Sarajevo in 10 days and the creation of a security zone 
with a radius of 30 km around the Bosnian capital. Surprised by 
the demand, which involves obvious risks for the French 
soldiers, Christopher made objections to the UN route, because 
of the risk of a Russian veto; he also mentioned the possibility 
of an immediate reprisal raid against the Serbian lines. 
  The French side rallied to the NATO solution which has 
finally received the go-ahead from the Hotel Matignon [prime 
minister's office] and the Elysee [president's office], but it 
is difficult to know what to think when you hear the remarks 
made by Bill Clinton who seems to link any American reaction to 
the result of an investigation to determine the origin of the 
mortar fire which killed 68 people on the little Sarajevo market 
place. Is Washington not playing a double game and seeking 
excuses to do nothing? Paris does not yet know what THE NEW 
YORK TIMES revealed on 15 February: On the eve of the mortar 
attack on the Sarajevo market, Warren Christopher sent a long 
study on Bosnia to Pentagon Chief William Perry and to Anthony 
Lake, the President's security adviser, in which he says he is 
"extremely uncomfortable" about the "passiveness" of U.S. policy 
and suggests a "new initiative." 
  On Sunday, in the early afternoon, the French decision was 
made and communicated to Warren Christopher by Alain Juppe: 
France will call for an emergency meeting of the Atlantic 
Council to repeat its proposal for an ultimatum and the creation 
of a 30 km security zone. The U.S. secretary of state approved 
of the approach in principle and suggested that the United 
States is prepared this time to be involved in the negotiations 
on the partition of Bosnia, provided certain territorial 
concessions are made to the Muslims. Late in the afternoon, 
Alain Juppe and Francois Leotard solemnly announced the decision 
at the Quai d'Orsay. To avoid having to wait for the 
hypothetical results of an uncertain investigation, they 
specified that their proposal is valid whoever was responsible 
for the previous day's attack. This attack, they explained, is 
the result of the siege of the city and it is this siege which 
must be lifted. 
  An anecdotal detail but one which is indicative of some 
reservations and pro-Serbian feelings: The defense minister, 
probably on the basis of information communicated to him by 
French military intelligence, explained that Sarajevo is the 
target of around 100 Serbian batteries, howitzers, and tanks. 
But the figure is much lower than the real one (it has since 
been corrected) because from that time the American and British 
intelligence services assessed it as between 250 and 300.... 
  On Monday 7 February, the French plan was accepted with 
amendments by the United States. Fearing that a 30 km zone 
around Sarajevo would demand too much monitoring from the Blue 
Helmets -- it must not come under Muslim control if the West 
does not want to be accused of fighting for them -- the 
Americans, still anxious to limit the dispatch of GI's to the 
area to the strict minimum, are proposing to reduce it to a 20 
km radius. 
  The French, all too happy that Washington should finally 
agree to be diplomatically involved in the Bosnian negotiations, 
accepted. All that remained to be done was for Bill Clinton to 
telephone John Major and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien 
to persuade them to support the plan and thus save NATO's 
credibility, which was starting to be a serious problem. Late 
on Wednesday 9 February, the NATO Council adopted the ultimatum 
in principle. 
  If this had not been done, Paris clearly states, it would 
have been impossible to rule out the hypothesis of a withdrawal 
of the French contingent in the medium term. This is a 
hypothesis which never had Francois Mitterrand's support but it 
is one to which Edouard Balladur would probably have resigned 
himself, because he is so afraid of the prospect of military 
losses. This is a risk which is now being shouldered by him, by 
Francois Mitterrand, Alain Juppe, and Francois Leotard.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A North Korean Gesture"] </F>
  [Text] North Korea celebrated the 52d birthday of the son 
and designated successor of the "great leader," Kim Chong-il, 
with a gesture of appeasement. In effect, Pyongyang agreed on 
Tuesday 15 February -- barely a week before the expiration of 
the ultimatum issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) -- to resume international inspections of its officially 
listed nuclear installations. 
  Inspectors will therefore once again be visiting the seven 
sites which they have been unable to visit for more than a year 
because of opposition from Pyongyang. Washington, Seoul, and 
Tokyo were immediately pleased with this new attitude and talks 
between the United States and North Korea resumed within hours. 
Nevertheless, both Japan and the IAEA hastened to point out 
that this agreement still did not cover the two sites which the 
Kim Il-song regime is accused of using to try and develop the 
atomic bomb. Both the CIA and certain well-informed Russian 
circles are convinced that Pyongyang already has several nuclear 
warheads. 
  North Korea's past attitude calls for caution. This is not 
the first time that it has laid down the law or reneged on its 
commitments. Just last week, it was still threatening to 
respond to international sanctions, whereas it is undoubtedly 
this very threat which led it to compromise. In any case, its 
maneuvering will have gained it a year that could be turned to 
profit by its atomic scientists. 
  Under these circumstances, it is important that we not 
deceive ourselves too much. Pyongyang's gesture cannot be 
considered a success for President Clinton, whose hesitant 
attitude contributed not inconsiderably to prolonging the 
crisis, and who has shown his inability to force a state that 
was openly violating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
to yield. 
  On the contrary, North Korea can feel that it was correct to 
force a crisis, and rightly so: In order to force the country 
to return to a "status quo ante," the Americans had to agree to 
initiate a political dialogue with Pyongyang and even to promise 
it possible diplomatic recognition and aid which its totally 
collapsed economy most urgently needs. And yet, the two 
contested sites have still not been opened up. 
  Even worse, the White House had to put up with the combined 
pressure of the North Koreans and their neighbors, who are 
worried about the risk of aggravating tension in the region. In 
the Korean peninsula -- the final frontier of the Cold War -- 
like elsewhere in the world, be it yesterday in Iraq or today in 
Bosnia, only a decisive and united attitude by the international 
community will prove effective in maintaining peace. Gaining 
time or yielding to pressure without a coherent strategy has its 
price sooner or later.

<F P=106> [Article signed V.V: "Drugs and Illegal Immigration -- </F>
Highly Successful Year for French Customs"] 
  [Text] Budget Minister and Government Spokesman Nicolas 
Sarkozy performed yesterday what amounted to an evaluation of 
the single market in its first year when he unveiled the amounts 
of drugs seized by French Customs in 1993. With some 38 tonnes 
of cannabis -- or twice as much as was seized in the previous 
year -- last year's seizures "reached an unprecedented level." 
Concurrently, 233 kilograms of heroin were seized -- a 
48-percent increase with respect to the previous year. As for 
cocaine, the increase is minimal, even though the absolute 
number is high: 1,284 kilograms (1,278 in 1992). Last, in the 
mercifully small LSD market, 23 grams of lysergid were seized in 
a single operation in 1993 -- enough to produce 400,000 doses 
for the underground British market. Here too, these are 
unprecedented amounts. 
<H5>  New Tools </H5>
  While record amounts of cocaine (1,400 kilograms) and heroin 
(400 kilograms) had been seized in 1990 and 1991, respectively, 
1993 saw a steady average progression. That is, "a 50-percent 
increase as compared with 1992," the minister explained, adding 
that it was difficult to determine the relative impact of better 
operation on the part of customs, and increased amounts of drugs 
smuggled into the national territory. "In any case, this 
indicates a highly alarming reality," Nicolas Sarkozy concluded, 
with new General Customs Director Jean-Luc Vialla looking on. 
  Mr. Vialla's services describe an "unprecedented level" of 
seizures for all types of drugs except opium and hemp plant and 
hemp oil. 
  Active international cooperation, selective road checks, air 
and marine monitoring are all part of the array of weapons used 
by customs, which intend to "use new tools" -- that is, fighting 
smugglers of chemical products used as precursors for the 
production of drugs, promoting cooperation in the international 
trade sector to identify illegal shipments, in addition to open 
sea interceptions and increased cooperation -- including with 
East European countries. Since 1 January 1993, customs have 
also been very active against illegal immigration, in 
cooperation with border police. The array of possibilities and 
prerogatives of customs has been extended in view of the 
implementation of the Schengen Convention, although the latter 
remains to come into effect. Last year's results -- 8,729 
persons held for questioning as compared with 5,177 in 1992 and 
5,246 in 1991 -- are indicative of the scope of the new 
measures. However, one must differentiate between foreign 
nationals in an irregular situation (2,907, a figure marginally 
higher than in previous years) and those turned away (5,822, or 
over twice as much as the 1991 and 1992 figures). 
  Last, Jean-Luc Vialla indicated that the Tracfin action 
group, which specializes in intelligence and operations against 
underground financial channels -- used, among other things, for 
the laundering of "dirty" money -- receives "50 to 60 statements 
of suspicion" a month from banks. Although none of the 40 cases 
currently processed by the courts has been judged yet due to 
their complexity, there is "no question of terminating Tracfin," 
Nicolas Sarkozy indicated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Massimo D'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F>
Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, by Sebastiano Messina in Rome 
on 16 February: "D'Alema Vents Feelings About His Toughest Day"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Messina] Basically, 
you were expecting this charge [of illicit party funding], Mr. 
D'Alema, were you not? 
  [D'Alema] The bringing of charges as a political weapon is 
something unprecedented in modern democracies. If someone 
tries, he can find three or four unscrupulous lawyers and set 
them to work in connection with the investigation of a number of 
[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's aides for having given money 
to postal service officials, and with the business involving his 
brother, Paolo -- well, he can try. He can formulate a fine 
charge and make the rounds of the attorneys' offices. Let us 
be frank: The very idea that someone should consider settling 
the political contest in this way seems to me frankly monstrous. 
  [Messina] But it has happened 
  [D'Alema] So, I tell you that this initiative on Craxi's 
part, this anti-PDS super-prosecuting attorney, is revealing. 
It sheds light on other judicial matters, other "spontaneous" 
statements from members of the business demimonde that evidently 
felt -- what shall we say -- inspired to act. Then, when he 
realized that he was not succeeding, he acted himself. He used 
a trick learned from judo -- causing your adversary to fall 
under his own impetus. I believe that this is all he has been 
doing for the past several months. It must be an obsession for 
him, his job. To contact people, to send them to attorneys' 
offices, to acquire documentation. In human terms, it is all 
rather pathetic: Someone who used to be a very prominent 
political leader, a statesman. 
  [Messina] You spent a long time at Attorney Mele's office. 
Is it true that you were questioned by the magistrates? 
  [D'Alema] What questioning! I went to the attorney's office 
to lodge a formal charge for libel against Bettino Craxi. And 
to institute a legal action in this connection. 
  [Messina] On the basis of what was reported in the 
newspapers? 
  [D'Alema] Certainly. He accused me of being the organizer, 
the promoter, the accomplice in a series of actions of illegal 
party funding. And this is not true. What is more, none of the 
attorney's offices in Italy knows anything about it either. It 
seems that this charge is nothing but a collection of judicial 
proceedings, statements, and articles cobbled together by some 
clever lawyer that Craxi can permit himself to pay. But it is 
all old hat. And since during the past two years of inquiries 
not only have I never been investigated by any attorney's 
office, but no judge has even felt the need to summon me as a 
witness. 
  [Messina] But do you or do you not know whether the 
magistrates have included you on the list of investigatees? 
  [D'Alema] I do not know; that is secret information, or 
should be. For that matter, we do not even know how many people 
have been included on the register of investigatees over the 
past two years, or who they are. We do not know. Because that 
is a preliminary and necessary action that the magistrate 
carries out in absolute secrecy. Above all, it is a secret to 
whoever is on the register, because he must not know that he is 
the subject of preliminary inquiries. But we have now 
monstrously distorted everything. 
  [Messina] But why does Craxi want to hit you and [PDS 
Secretary] Occhetto? Is it revenge, an attempt to spread the 
guilt? 
  [D'Alema] He wants to hit us because were are in the midst 
of 
an election campaign. 
  [Messina] What direct interest could he have in doing so, 
since he is no longer your political adversary? 
  [D'Alema] First, Craxi is motivated by an implacable hatred 
for those who have always combated him. He considers us his 
fundamental enemies. From this viewpoint, I feel honored by so 
much esteem. It is the best reply to those who used to say that 
we and Craxi were closely associated: This action bears the 
stamp of hatred. Moreover, it is not true that Craxi is not in 
the arena. He is. I do not know who may have deluded 
themselves that the decline of a political system would put an 
end to that system of government, that complex of vested 
interests and businesses. Those forces still exist. The 
difference now is that Berlusconi is in the front rank and Craxi 
in the second rank. Craxi is involved in the political 
struggle, as well as seeking a personal vendetta. 
  [Messina] Is there not some personal factor in this 
business? What did you say last time you met? 
  [D'Alema] I have not spoken with Craxi for a very long time. 
I believe that I have definitely maintained a civil attitude 
toward him since his fall from grace. I have never attacked 
him. I fought him when he was powerful. He will not find a 
single statement by me against him since he became implicated in 
the corruption inquiry. I love political struggle, not the 
persecution of individuals. 
  [Messina] What were your thoughts the other night? 
  [D'Alema] Personally, I am confident, I actually slept 
fairly 
well except for the fact that my three and one-half year old son 
wakes up from time to time. Of course, I have some concern for 
my friends and family. 
  [Messina] Of what nature? 
  [D'Alema] Well, I will have to visit the people who know me 
as a result of the battles that I have waged, and I will have 
to explain to them that I am an honest man. That is the last 
thing in the world that I thought that I would have to do. 
  [Messina] And will you do so? 
  [D'Alema] Who knows? You have the suspicion that the person 
in front of you may have seen a television news program, read 
the newspapers. And frankly I find that rather difficult to 
accept. 
  [Messina] Have you thought what you would do if you were to 
receive an investigation notice? 
  [D'Alema] I do not need to think about it. I am a fighter. 
And we progressives have decided on the following rule: If 
anyone receives an investigation notice for offenses connected 
with matters relating to Bribe City, including illegal party 
funding, he will not stand as a candidate. This is the rule, 
and I will adhere to it, like everyone else. Having said that, 
I am a responsible person, and certain things are not solely up 
to me. 
  [Messina] What if they were up to you? 
  [D'Alema] I will tell you that I am not very keen. 
  [Messina] To conduct an election campaign? 
  [D'Alema] No, I would willingly conduct it more 
energetically. I am not very keen to go around telling people: 
You must vote for me. I feel a great weight on my mind at the 
moment.

<F P=106> [Report by Giorgio Battistini: "President Appeals to </F>
Judges, Press, Television"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] "I want to state 
clearly," [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] 
Occhetto said, "that it is unacceptable for someone such as 
Bettino Craxi -- who has been implicated several times in 
serious public offenses -- to permit himself to tour Italy's 
attorneys' offices in order to issue slanderous and groundless 
charges against the PDS and its officials." 
  "What Craxi is trying to do," Occhetto continued, "is harm 
the PDS and its leadership group. I solemnly declare here and 
now that we feel united by this charge brought by someone who is 
seeking to lay obstacles and traps in the path of justice. In 
the presence of this blackguardly and clumsy initiative, let it 
be known that the position of all the comrades slandered by 
Craxi -- from Occhetto to D'Alema, Stefanini, and the rest -- is 
the same. It is the position of someone who proclaims his own 
innocence and aloofness from the Bribe City system, the very 
system of which Craxi was no less than the main architect and 
leading representative." 
  Having dealt with Craxi, the secretariat also issued an 
appeal to the judiciary urging them not to allow themselves to 
be used by "meddlers" and to ensure that at least those working 
on delicate inquiries "maintain full control over and full 
responsibility for information relating to their work and 
decisions. This would prevent the creation of any areas of 
uncertainty" that could be occupied by those wanting "to 
irremediably undermine the election campaign." For the sake "of 
democracy," the PDS calls for a "rigorous, honest, and correct" 
election campaign. And it "trusts" that "everyone will 
understand this supreme necessity." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "The Fleet Sets Sail, But </F>
Uncertainty Still Surrounds the Anti-Knight Role"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The "habemus papam" ["we have a pope"] came 
at 2030. It was uttered by Davide Visani -- the Botteghe Oscure 
[PDS headquarters] bigwig who had been sitting at a negotiating 
table which occasionally resembled a boxing ring -- thus 
announcing the end of the long negotiations between the eight 
souls of the progressive camp. An agreement has been reached -- 
a "positive" understanding which includes a number of "qualified 
and important" choices. As from today, then, the left can 
actually launch its electoral campaign against what Visani calls 
"the old and new right." 
  The last round ended at about 1800, thus bringing also 
another match to a close, namely, the Sicilian match that 
resulted in the only serious wound inflicted on the allies by 
Rete, which was unshakable in its determination to exclude the 
Socialists from single-member constituencies. [Italian 
Socialist Party, PSI, Secretary] Del Turco made a forceful 
protest, denouncing the fact that not even the outcome of the 
elections in Catania "could convince those who started out with 
strongly held positions." Competing with the progressives, the 
PSI candidates will in Sicily also run single-member 
constituencies, but in a responsible fashion, the PSI secretary 
said. "We will not dramatize this disagreement beyond the 
confines of the island." 
  The Sicilian case, they say at the Bottegone [PDS 
headquarters], was the last hurdle to be confronted. Basically, 
it confirms the fact that [Rete leader] Orlando's troops will 
have the lion's share with 26 out of 41 candidates for 
single-member districts. In Palermo, Luciano Violante will 
serve as a rival attraction, heading the list against [Forza 
Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, and -- among others -- 
Antonino Caponnetto, Pietro Folena, Alfredo Galasso, and Gaspare 
Nuccio will be running in single-member constituencies. In 
eastern Sicily, the best known names are those of Anna 
Finocchiaro, Giuseppe Ayala, Claudio Fava, Tano Grasso, and 
Franco Corleone. 
  The greatest uncertainties have also been dispelled in the 
Lazio region, even though there is still some doubt concerning 
the identity of the progressive candidate in the toughest 
contest of all -- that against Silvio Berlusconi in the Rome 1 
constituency, in the elections for the lower house. This 
constituency is a prestigious showcase including the historical 
sites -- and some are not hiding the possibility of a 
"sensational surprise," consisting of an "unimpeachable and 
outstanding" personality entering the field to take advantage of 
the 3 percent lead won by the progressives in the area following 
last December's contest between [Rome mayor] Rutelli and 
[National Alliance leader] Fini. At the regional coalition 
headquarters, however, they were saying that it was almost 
certain that the candidate would be Loredana De Petris, from 
Rome, aged 36, who was a member of DP [Proletarian Democracy] 
before joining the Greens, whose parliamentary floor leader she 
now is. "It came as a surprise, and also a bit of a shock," she 
acknowledged in her role as the "philosopher" against the Knight 
[Berlusconi's nickname], "but all in all it will probably be an 
amusing challenge. Anyway, we will not be fighting only over 
such issues as sidewalks which need mending...." 
  In Rome, following the established tradition, the list will 
be headed by the PDS secretary in constituencies with 
proportional voting; Giovanna Melandri will be leading AD 
[Democratic Alliance], whereas Ottaviano Del Turco will be the 
PSI's number one. Catholic Edoardo Missoni, the nephew of the 
well-known designer, will meet the impossible challenge posed by 
Gianfranco Fini in the Prati constituency. Much safer 
constituencies will be fought for by "lightning" minister 
Vincenzo Visco, in eastern Rome, and Communist Renewal member 
Famiano Crucianelli, who will be contending with Lucio Manisco 
for North Viterbo. A good constituency -- Civitavecchia -- also 
goes to Carlo Alfredo Moro, the statesman's brother, who has 
accepted Carniti's Social Christians' invitation. 
  Basically, the pattern of the candidacies in the left's 
strongholds has been confirmed: Turin acknowledges Communist 
Renewal's strength (with Fausto Bertinotti as candidate), 
whereas Genoa is garrisoned, among others, by Gino Giugni and 
Ferdinando Adornato, heading AD's list. Umbria -- reflecting 
the fact that of 12 single-member district candidates, five will 
be journalists (Walter Veltroni, Ferdinando Adornato, Giuseppe 
Giulietti, Paolo Raffelli, and Leonardo Caponi) -- has 
definitively given the progressive team the nickname of "the 
editorial team." In Tuscany, the following candidates will be 
standing: Armando Cossutta (in Scandicci), Sergio Garavini 
(Arezzo), Mauro Paisan (Pisa), Enrico Boselli (Valdichiana), 
Valdo Spini (Florence 3), and Sandra Bonsanti (Florence 1), with 
Luigi Berlinguer, Carlo Ripa di Meana, Antonino Caponnetto, and 
Willer Bordon heading the lists in the proportional elections. 
  In Emilia -- traditionally a communist and republican 
stronghold -- the safe-constituency strategy prevented the 
rescue of Augusto Barbera, who had previously announced that he 
was willing to withdraw his candidacy. Among the best known 
"parachuted" candidates are Giuseppe Ayala in Ravenna, Claudio 
Petruccioli in Bologna-Modena, and Willer Bordon in Rimini -- 
all of whom are standing as candidates for the Senate. As 
regards the lower house, the candidates are -- together with 
Occhetto in West Bologna -- Gianni Mattioli in Rimini-Riccione, 
Fausto Vigevani in Cesena, Gianfranco Pasquino in one of the 
Reggio constituencies, and singer Pierangelo Bertoli in 
Piacenza. Giorgio Benvenuto will head AD's list in the 
proportional elections. 
  Among other candidacies which have been confirmed -- in 
addition to Franco Bassanini playing the anti-Bossi part in 
Milan 1 -- there are Giovanni Raboni and Giandomenico Pisapia, 
who will be standing for the Senate in Milan. Giorgio Ruffolo 
will head AD's list in Calabria, and Miriam Mafai will be the 
lower house candidate for Pescara city -- a comeback, almost 40 
years later, following her long experience as a local councillor.

<F P=106> [Article by Helena Garrido: "Pragmatism Is the Golden Rule"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Last week, the prime minister and the minister 
of finance made speeches on economic policy that, even if 
different in language, clearly revealed that they were based 
more on pragmatic principles than any other ideological tendency. 
  Prime Minister Cavaco Silva enunciated three basic rules 
allowing the government to choose a combination of budgetary and 
monetary policies. "The first is that there are no general 
revenues; each case is different and must be dealt with 
according to its own specificity; the second is that the 
stabilization policy must be be seen in the context of the 
medium- and long-term development of the country; the third is 
pragmatism: Woe to the individual who does not respect 
theoretical principles, but also woe to whomever is led only by 
them," said Cavaco Silva, affirming that these are the norms he 
has always taken into account. 
  Of the three rules, only the second is purely economic. 
Despite the fact that the others also reveal the relative 
fragility of economic theory, they are much closer to the 
objectives of the purely political world, that is, maintaining 
power and reconciling interests within the context of minimizing 
for electoral purposes the social costs of the implementation of 
these policies. 
  The speech by Minister of Finance Eduardo Catroga is the 
application of these rules. 
  The present situation "demands a combination of 
macroeconomic 
policies that foster economic recovery through the adequate use 
of available instruments in the areas of budgetary, monetary, 
and incomes policies," said Catroga in the speech outlining for 
the benefit of entrepreneurs the 1994-95 economic policy. 
  Catroga denied there was a change in economic policy and 
emphasized that "each concrete moment" needs a certain 
combination of different policies [passage omitted]. 
  The problems mentioned by Catroga and his promises--both 
within the confines of the entrepreneurs' concerns--as well as 
the constant use of the word "company"--are the most explicit 
elements of pragmatism advocated by Cavaco Silva. Interest rates 
must drop; the government will reduce the stamp tax in 1995, 
reduce reserves and the weight of state debt, stimulate savings, 
energize the capitals market, and practice wage moderation. In 
short, a group of marvelous proposals for an entrepreneur. 
  The constant praise of companies that Catroga says are "the 
agents of change," as well as the implicit minimization of 
macroeconomics--quite opportune in recessionary times--complete 
the favorable aspect of the message. 
  However, since no one believes in miracles, realism emerges 
with regard to difficulties. For instance, Catroga repeated what 
others have already said: "Recovery may be slow and difficult." 
  More important than the message is the messenger. Catroga is 
a finance minister who has been an entrepreneur all his life, 
and he is likable and affable. Entrepreneurs heard the right 
message at the right time, enunciated by the right person; thus 
all ingredients are present to make the speech credible and 
optimistic enough to foster investment. Catroga's appointment, 
therefore, seems to be a genuine example of Cavaco Silva's three 
rules. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Lurdes Ferreira: "Risks and Defects of </F>
Portuguese Economy"] 
  [Excerpts] "Dependence on subsidies" is a refuge without a 
future: If Portuguese entrepreneurs do not prepare themselves, 
Portugal runs the risk of becoming a subcontractor for the 
benefit of its European partners. This is the clear warning 
delivered by a study by Luis Barata of the central planning 
department of the state secretariat for regional planning and 
development published last week. The study details the risks and 
defects of industrial specialization in the Portuguese economy. 
  The study also presents a number of disquieting conclusions 
on the future of some industries with regard to specialization. 
For instance, it emphasizes the probability that industries such 
as textiles, electronic components, and pharmaceuticals will 
witness the deterioration of their industrial specialization in 
the medium term. 
  The scenario is no more encouraging for metallurgy, 
armaments, telecommunications, and machine tools, given 
increasing competitiveness. In addition, the horizon is clearly 
unfavorable for data processing equipment, cereals, organic 
chemistry, base minerals, optics, and photography. 
  On the basis of indicators culled from the end of the 1980's 
and the beginning of the 1990's, the author argues that Portugal 
"continues to present a weak industrial structure" at a time 
when specialization is seen as the name of the game. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to the study, the recent evolution of the nation's 
industries "has not brought significant changes to its basic 
characteristics, maintaining an imbalance in which the textile 
and forestry sectors have a disproportionate weight." 
  The fragile aspects of the Portuguese economy are also 
defined: a weak industrial infrastructure that is too polarized, 
be it by regions or by sectors, and rests on the "old, 
superseded" standard of cheap labor. Therefore, new methods of 
production, improved quality, and the establishment of a good 
image are considered decisive for those sectors in which the 
Portuguese economy traditionally maintains comparative 
advantages: textiles and clothing, ceramics, wines, and forestry 
products. [passage omitted] 
  The foreseeable trend for the three large categories in 
which 
the author divides the Portuguese economy (internationally 
specialized, dependent and relatively self-sufficient) are as 
follows: in the activities that were specialized in the past, 
there are good prospects for beverages, leather and footwear, 
canned fruits and vegetables, and consumer electronics, because 
of previous investments [passage omitted]. 
  For dependent industries, increasing specialization is 
foreseen in six fields: electrical equipment of various types, 
aeronautics, nonferrous metals, transportation and public works 
equipment, and oleaginous products. 
  Strangely, the study maintains that specialization in the 
production of auto parts will tend to stagnate. Despite the 
increased auto production foreseen for this sector--mainly 
because of the Ford-Volkswagen project--the study believes that 
"imports will tend to increase unless companies furnishing both 
products for the Portuguese market and a majority percentage for 
direct export establish themselves in Portugal." 
  For the relatively self-sufficient industries, there are 
positive prospects for industrial electrical equipment, 
ceramics, cement/stone, commercial vehicles, nonferrous metals, 
furniture, light vehicles, plastics, and boiler equipment. In 
spite of positive signs for the future of these activities, the 
study warns that real results depend on the evolution of the 
Portuguese and Spanish economies, contrary to the other two 
groups, where problems are of a "European, or even world 
dimension."

<F P=106> [Jose Maria Brunet report on remarks by Spanish Prime </F>
Minister Felipe Gonzalez at 11 February press conference in 
Madrid: "Gonzalez Believes That CiU's Support Guarantees Stable 
Legislative Term"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez believes 
that political stability has been guaranteed on the basis of the 
cooperation with CiU [Convergence and Union], and for the whole 
legislative term. Gonzalez believes that the level of 
cooperation achieved with the nationalists makes it possible to 
ensure governability, and interprets the lack of deadlines in 
this relationship as indicating that it will continue 
indefinitely, without ruling out the possibility that there 
could be some "minor hitch" or even a "fundamental 
disagreement," which would have to be examined, if it occurs, 
"at the proper time." 
  But in any event, Felipe Gonzalez said that he feels 
"perfectly comfortable" from the viewpoint of "the government's 
initiative and stability in decisionmaking. My stance has not 
changed on what could be a hypothetical coalition government" 
with CiU, Gonzalez stated, adding immediately that he did not 
raise this Thursday [10 February] with Generalitat [Catalan 
autonomous government] premier Jordi Pujol, "because it was 
unnecessary since it was constantly implicit in the 
conversation." The prime minister explained -- as Pujol did on 
the previous day -- the agreement in analysis with the CiU 
leader, especially on the issue of the economy, with respect to 
the need to support the country's productive economy. 
  "It is assumed," Gonzalez said, "that when you back 
stability, you do so throughout a legislative term. This does 
not mean that there cannot be a slight hitch or disagreement 
which is deemed substantial in the legislative term, but until 
it arises, I would not consider in any event -- and this is what 
I told Mr. Pujol -- this idea of setting dates, because it is 
rather absurd." 
  Gonzalez described his conversation with Pujol Thursday as 
"extremely interesting." During it, "we found that an attempt 
is being made to create a wrong impression of what this effort 
at understanding between the government and CiU means," when 
"our bid goes beyond pure parliamentary arithmetic. This is a 
bid to involve CiU with the nation's government, and hence with 
the policies which affect the state as a whole." 
  The prime minister stressed that there is no "blackmail or 
pressure" in this relationship, and everything that has been 
negotiated has been put forward "clearly." On the issue of 
autonomy, he said that he regards as a "necessity" an agreement 
on new transfers [of powers from the central government to the 
autonomous communities], a matter which must be negotiated with 
all the "fast-track" communities, not forgetting that there are 
always "nuances" based on their respective distinctive features. 
Hence there will be bilateral negotiations with each of these 
communities, without excluding political dialogue between 
parties, which directly concerns the People's Party. 
  Nevertheless, the prime minister detected in the People's 
Party's stances contradictions which must be surmounted. This 
is the case -- he added -- when the People's Party demands a 
single administration one day and deplores "slimming down" the 
state's peripheral administration the following day. This 
latter administration "will be simplified" without this 
entailing any relinquishment of its always being represented in 
all the country's territories. Gonzalez mentioned his meeting 
with Chaves, Fraga, and Lerma in order to conclude that many 
communities are demanding "substantially the same" things, which 
facilitates the dialogue on the impetus to autonomy. This 
process is not taking place owing to "strictly nationalist" 
demands but as a result of a "different view of the functioning 
of a state organized on the basis of political decentralization." 
  Gonzalez expressed his desire to continue the dialogue with 
the People's Party and for the contacts on the democratic 
impetus to bear fruit soon.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical

should assume a leading role in peacekeeping operations in the 
former Soviet Union. 
  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE was able to report on Monday [14

that the Coordinating Council for Military Affairs in the CIS 
(the former Soviet Union) has asked Denmark to assume this 
leadership role. 
  "It is probably wrong to envisage that Denmark or any other 
country should play a special role. The United Nations or the 
CSCE should play such a role; we have to say that it is 
international organizations that should play a special role in 
the resolution of conflicts between Russia and its new 
neighbors," Helveg Petersen told the TV-Avisen program last 
night. 
  But he is positive to the idea that Denmark should make 
troops available. 
  "Denmark has peacekeeping operations experience that is 
unique. We have been involved in many such operations, and we 
have trained personnel in the Danish defense forces and 
elsewhere to take on such operations. So if the United Nations 
and the CSCE become involved in these operations in the former 
Soviet Union, well, naturally Denmark must also give 
consideration to the role it should play."

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen by </F>
Lisbeth Knudsen and Ole Lorenzen; place and date not given: "The 
Criticism You Learn From"] 
  [Text] After one year as prime minister, the fight against 
unemployment and the effort on behalf of the less privileged 
still has top priority. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen will never abandon 
his hope of getting a job for everyone. But the prime minister 
would rather promise too little than too much. 
  He has said many of the same things for a year. And he has 
thought about persisting in saying them. 
  In 1994 and 1995 as well, Danes will hear a prime minister 
talk about whether we will do something about unemployment. 
  Despite public opinion polls and politicians -- from the 
parties that make up the coalition government as well -- that 
say that we will never again see full employment, that is an 
opinion to which Poul Nyrup Rasmussen will not subscribe. 
  "The Social Democratic Party [SDP] will never abandon its 
hope of creating a framework in our country within which 
everyone can be active. Regardless of whether economic 
conditions turn up or down, it is our basic point of departure 
that everyone should be able to work," said Poul Nyrup Rasmussen 
in advance of the government's first anniversary next Tuesday. 
  Employment was the main issue when the government came into 
office and it will be the main issue for many years to come. 
  "But we are talking about full employment that is different 
from what we knew in the 1960's. Work will be better 
distributed. We can indeed get everyone working, but it should 
be clear that that means joining with the change in values that 
has occurred. People also want to have time left over just to 
have things. If we just want to have more things, then that is 
when the pinch will come," the prime minister said. 
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] But do you believe that a reduction in 
unemployment from 350,000 to 330,000 by the end of this year is 
enough to convince people that we can achieve full employment? 
  [Rasmussen] It is true that at the end of 1993 unemployment 
had not come down enough. But there is so much force in this 
that if we have a chance to continue our work, then it will 
succeed. 
  All the same, I do not exclude the possibility that the 
numbers will get better because there is so much spring coming 
in the economy. But in contrast to the former government, I will 
not predict anything that cannot be achieved. I would rather 
give a realistic, cautious view. 
<H5>  A Better Daily Life </H5>
  But even if employment is still the main issue, the 
government's agenda is not exhausted. 
  Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has a number of points that Danes will 
hear about in the months to come: 
  [Rasmussen] The first thing is that the reforms must work in 
practice. It does not surprise me that with such major reforms 
there are administrative problems. Everything cannot work from 
day one. So, together with the cities, we must see to it that 
everyone gets the message. With regard to tax reform, I can very 
well sit here and say that 770,000 retirees out of 800,000 will 
get tax cuts. That is no help. It is each individual who should 
know what the changes mean. 
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] But has your government been good enough 
about informing people about this? 
  [Rasmussen] No, we haven't. We have to work on this 
throughout all of 1994. But for example, with regard to 
retirees, it is important for me to emphasize that they will get 
their money. There will be a shift in the timing, but they will 
get it. 
  The government's second task will be to come up with visible 
improvements in people's everyday lives in selected areas. 
  [Rasmussen] We have just started. With regard to child care, 
I mentioned the child care guarantee in my opening speech [to 
the Folketing]. This has not been forgotten. In negotiations 
with the cities, we will see to it that by the end of 1995 
everyone will be able to have their child cared for from the 
time it is one year old. Second, there is the health sector. We 
want to bring the waiting period down to three months. We want 
to get the beds out of the corridors. 
  The third point is service to the elderly and those living 
alone, where we will see to it that people come and visit them. 
This is not just a matter of whether there are enough home care 
helpers, but of making sure there are a number of other 
important people nearby who can help. 
  Fourth, those people who live quiet lives in the shadows -- 
regardless of whether they are mentally ill or handicapped -- 
will have better daily lives. We will create frameworks so they 
will have a better life. 
<H5>  Real Results </H5>
  He is pleased with the way this first year has turned out. 
  Tax reform, labor market reform, and leave of absence 
provisions are the "biggest reforms to have been implemented in 
the past 10 years." And the prime minister does not agree with 
criticism within his party about the lack of a Social Democratic 
profile and the talk that the government is still nonsocialist. 
  [Rasmussen] I have heard voices from that chorus. I would 
say 
two things about this. History has also taught us that Social 
Democratic minority governments do not have difficulties 
achieving a profile, but sometimes they have difficulties 
turning the profile into real results. Basically I have been 
concerned -- after 10 years in the opposition -- with one single 
thing: Social Democratic positions should be turned into 
practical results. Not 100 percent. Things have really never 
been that way -- nor were they in our earlier history -- but 
good progress in the right direction. That I believe we have 
achieved. 
  The worst thing that could happen between 25 January last 
year and the election at the end of this one would be if people 
could say to a government headed up by the Social Democrats: 
Well, you promised a lot but you didn't do anything. 
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] So you aren't afraid that the outcome of 
the election for the SDP will be affected by the fact that you 
as prime minister have had to agree to an awful lot of 
compromises to get the government to stay together? 
  [Rasmussen] No, I'm not afraid of that. Social Democratic 
voters -- and voters, generally speaking -- have a very good 
sense of what the working conditions are. The SDP has always 
been willing to cooperate with other parties. 
  Social Democratic voters know full well that results come 
about only through conscious cooperation. If I seem optimistic, 
it is because what we put our effort into we have implemented. 
And now the results are starting to show. 
  We will be very careful to see to it that the systems that 
are now set up do not get defended just for the sake of the 
systems. We want to be ready to listen and make adjustments 
where that is necessary. 
<H5>  No to a Presidential Election </H5>
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] But supposing we turn things around. There 
are two parties in the government that look as if they will be 
wiped out as consequence of being part of the coalition 
government. Won't you have to be very considerate of them? 
  [Rasmussen] I am convinced that the Center Democrats [CD] 
will see an increased influx of voters. The CD has a joint 
responsibility for economic policy and social policy. The CD is 
also a socially aware party that will not go along with 
extensive social cuts. So combined with their preoccupation with 
business policy, the CD voters will also acknowledge that. With 
regard to the Christian People's Party, from the beginning the 
party has put great emphasis on family policy. The Christian 
People's Party can rightly point out that the party has had a 
lot to do with the changes that are now occurring for families 
with children. 
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] Will there also be room for them in an 
election that is about Poul Nyrup Rasmussen or Uffe 
Ellemann-Jensen? 
  [Rasmussen] Here there is a bit of an influence from the 
wave 
we have been seeing from the United States, this preoccupation 
with individuals. The upcoming Folketing election has been 
called a presidential election between Uffe Ellemann-Jensen and 
myself. I do not look upon it that way. On the one hand, I will 
show up any time when we have to discuss policies, positions, 
and platforms. What does the Liberal Party want, what do the SDP 
and the government want? I very much want to take part in 
discussing this, and there will be no shortage of involvement 
and appearances. On the other hand, I will have to back out if 
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen wants to engage in mudslinging. If so, 
he'll have to find someone else to play with. 
  Personalizing [issues] has its unavoidable place in the 
modern media picture, but it must never gain the upper hand. A 
discussion between the Liberal Party on the one hand and the SDP 
on the other is a much too simplified picture of Danish 
politics. There should be room for all parties. My effort will 
always be to have every shade of opinion represented that exists 
in the picture. There should also be room for the CD to have its 
profile, for the Christian People's Party to have its, and the 
Radical Liberal to have its. 
<H5>  You Shouldn't Get Shaken Up </H5>
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] Nevertheless, don't you think some when, 
as 
prime minister, you see your party dip under 30 percent in the 
opinion polls? 
  [Rasmussen] In a job such as this, you think long and hard. 
Primarily you say to yourself that one week's opinion polls, two 
weeks' opinion polls, the summer of 1993's opinion polls can be 
hard to take. A bit of concern and alarm can spread. But deep 
down inside you tell yourself: You've got time for yourself and 
what you're doing. Go to the trouble of explaining what we're in 
the process of doing. It's clear that there were times during 
the summer of 1993 when there were major demands placed on my 
own sturdiness. It may well be that nice things will not always 
be written, but that's now the way it is in Danish politics. You 
shouldn't get shaken up by a little negative criticism. But I 
make a major distinction between whether it is personal 
criticism or criticism because of the job you have. The latter 
you can put up with, and you've got to learn from it. 
  [DET FRI AKTUELT] Have you thought about celebrating the 
anniversary on Tuesday? 
  [Rasmussen] We'll celebrate with a government meeting -- an 
evening meeting -- at which we will first discuss politics and 
then we'll sit down with one another. Have a drink and have a 
good time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gloomy Future If We Vote `No'"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen (National 
Coalition Party) has rejected claims that the report on the 
effects of Finland's staying outside the EU [European Union] has 
been classified as secret. 
  "The opposite is the case. The results of the investigation 
must be made public as quickly as possible," he said yesterday 
when commenting on reports in ILTA SANOMAT that the government 
is trying to keep the "report on the repercussions" secret. 
  The report says that a section of industry would move 
abroad, 
as would many jobs. Nor would there be new investment in a 
Finland that had placed itself outside the European Union. 
  According to Salolainen, the reason why the government has 
not made the report public is that the work on it is still 
continuing. For example, the sections on agriculture, regional 
policy, and foreign policy are still only half finished. 
  The report, sections of which have now leaked out to the 
general public, is the report that the government commissioned 
in spring 1993 and that is to figure in the EU debate prior to 
the referendum later this year.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Cautious Greek Minister in </F>
Helsinki"] 
  [Text] Greece's agriculture minister thinks that the EU's 
[European Union] current agricultural system was not designed to 
take account of the sort of conditions that prevail in Finland. 
Agriculture Minister Yeoryios Moraitis said in Helsinki 
yesterday that in the membership negotiations there are still 
open questions of this type that need bold political decisions. 
  Greece currently holds the EU presidency, and Moraitis will 
therefore play a central role when the EU reaches a decision on 
its agricultural goals in the membership negotiations. 
  Yesterday Moraitis held five hours of talks with Agriculture 
and Forestry Minister Martti Pura, and he also met Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti 
Salolainen. 
  After the meeting Pura said that there had been no 
negotiations, but that Moraitis had been briefed on Finland's 
goals. No new issues emerged in the negotiations, Pura said. 
  Moraitis was tight-lipped when it came to answering 
questions 
-- for example, about Spain's proposal that the new member 
countries' net contributions should be targeted in support to 
the poorest member countries. As the holder of the presidency, 
Greece must be cautious and not comment on something that will 
perhaps not happen, Moraitis said.

Make a Profit in the EU"] 
  [Text] Unlike Sweden, Finland will be a net recipient in 
the event of EU [European Union] membership. This is shown by 
the latest estimates from the EU Commission. 
  This means that Finland will receive more from the EU budget 
than it pays in. 
  According to the Commission's estimates, Finland's net 
contribution will amount to around ECU100 million, corresponding 
to something over 600 million markkas. 
  This is due to the seriously weakened Finnish economy and 
the 
large payments that are expected to be paid back to Finland for 
agriculture and regional policy support. 
  But a spokesman for the Commission stressed that this figure 
should be taken with a pinch of salt. As long as membership 
negotiations have not settled the chapters on agriculture and 
regional support, the calculations are unreliable. 
  The other three countries -- Sweden, Austria, and Norway -- 
will be net contributors in the event of membership -- that is, 
they will pay more into the EU budget than they will receive in 
return in payments from the EU's various funds. And Sweden will 
be the biggest net contributor, with probably the highest 
membership fee per inhabitant.

<F P=106> [Tomas Hellen report: "Korkman: The Depression Is Over"] </F>
  [Text] Finance Ministry chief economist Sixten Korkman is 
also beginning to incline toward declaring that the depression 
is over. 
  "Undoubtedly a turn has now taken place. Perhaps it cannot 
yet be seen in the statistics, but there are many indications 
that the swing has either happened, is happening at the moment, 
or will happen shortly," he said yesterday at a seminar arranged 
by banking firm Ane Gyllenberg. 
  Korkman predicted that economic growth will be "strong" in 
1995, and voiced confidence that the expansion thereafter will 
be both enduring and vital. Among other things he pointed to 
satisfactory competitiveness, the absence of bottlenecks, and 
the balance of payments surplus that mean that this time the 
external restrictions on growth this time are minor. 
  According to Korkman, economic policy is aiming for 
export-led growth which will bring balance to Finland's foreign 
business and in this way bring down interest-rate levels. Only 
after this will investments start moving, consumer demand 
reawaken, and new jobs be created. 
  "Unemployment is the Finnish economy's biggest problem, and 
the only way of curing it is a long period of significant 
growth." 
  Korkman warned that the rate of inflation could increase if 
the upturn is a steep one, but he nevertheless described the 
risk of this as small. He predicted that the large surplus of 
timber in the forests will hold stumpage prices in check, and 
said that the high level of unemployment will reduce the risk of 
a spiral of wage inflation. 
  Korkman also commented on the debate surrounding the recent 
improvement in the strength of the markka. In his view the 
markka is not "greatly undervalued," at least not measured in 
terms of purchasing-power parity. 
  "It is true that the markka has fallen greatly since 
devaluation and since it began to float freely, but most of this 
fall went toward eradicating its former overvaluation, which 
amounted to dozens of percent." 
  On the other hand he said that he believes that the level of 
real-term interest rates and the real costs of loans in Finland 
are still "high" in historical terms -- an indication that he 
would prefer that the markka's continued rise were checked and 
that the Bank of Finland went for an active cut in interest 
rates.

<F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "Norway Must Pay 9 Million to the </F>
EU"] 
  [Text] There is a chance of yet another tug-of-war in the 
final phase of the EU [European Union] negotiations -- over the 
applicant countries' payments into the EU system. The new 
applicant countries are expected to be net contributors to the 
EU's joint coffers, and this will give the applicant countries a 
good card to play in the final phase of the negotiations. As 
yet Norway has not offered the EU any particular sum, and this 
will be one of the last areas that will be resolved. On the 
basis of the rules that exist today for the calculation of 
membership contributions, Norway's gross contribution will 
probably be around 8.5 billion kroner per year. 
  EU cooperation is financed through various taxes, import 
duties, a percentage of value-added tax, and an element 
proportionate to countries' GNP. In the past the government has 
estimated Norway's gross contribution at around 7 million 
kroner. Compensating for price rises in the intervening period, 
this sum will now be somewhere in the region of 8.5 billion 
kroner. 
  However, Norway's net contribution will be much less. This 
is because Norway will get back money from the EU system in the 
form of regional support and agricultural support. It is 
difficult to determine exactly how much this will be, because 
these central elements in the negotiations have not been 
resolved as yet. As a result no one knows the exact effect on 
the figures the outcome of the negotiations will have. 
  The fact that Spain now wants more money from the applicant 
countries for its own regions and the poorer areas of the EU is 
being viewed by the Norwegian side as yet another illustration 
of the fact that Spain is the most difficult country to deal 
with. But people are hoping that the other member countries will 
succeed in disciplining Spain in the final phase. The trump 
card in the negotiations is the same "membership money," which 
Spain wants more of. The argument runs that if Spain behaves in 
such a way that the negotiations break down there will not be 
any money either for Spain or the EU.

<F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "EU Stands Firm on Alcohol"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- While Trade Minister Grete Knudsen was 
stubbornly repeating in Brussels yesterday that Norway is 
adhering to its demand to be allowed also to keep its alcohol 
wholesale and import monopolies, the EU [European Union] 
countries reached agreement at an internal meeting that Norway 
must make do with keeping only its alcohol retail monopoly. A 
letter to Norway containing the offer that Norway should accept 
a Finnish-Swedish solution is expected to be sent within a few 
days, AFTENPOSTEN has been told by well-informed sources. 
  At a meeting yesterday of the EU countries' special working 
group for the negotiations with the applicant nations, there was 
broad agreement that there can be no suggestion of giving Norway 
a better solution in the field of alcohol policy than that which 
Sweden and Finland have already accepted. Norway's argument 
that its alcohol monopolies are an issue that has already been 
decided in the EEA [European Economic Area] and that is now 
being looked at by the ESA [EFTA Surveillance Authority] -- the 
special overview body for the EEA agreement -- was rejected as 
untenable. Norway is now negotiating membership of the EU, and 
this is something that is quite different from the EEA, several 
countries said at the EU meeting. 
  Well-informed sources have told AFTENPOSTEN that if Norway 
will not accept a Swedish-Finnish solution, it will be 
impossible to close this important chapter in the negotiations. 
It would then also be impossible to complete the negotiations 
with Norway, it was added. The attitude at the meeting between 
the EU countries sent the clear message that people are 
beginning to lose patience with Norway over this issue. It was 
also said that the EU has actually given Sweden and Finland a 
generous solution by not demanding that the state's retail 
monopoly should also end. 
  Trade Minister Grete Knudsen was in Brussels "to get to 
know" 
Hans van den Broek, the European Commission's man responsible 
for the negotiations, and to review the state of the 
negotiations. At a news conference after the meeting, Knudsen 
said that the two had talked about what "minor matters" in the 
negotiations are in line to be tidied up in order to clear the 
way for a concentration on fisheries, agriculture, and regional 
policy. However, it was unclear whether agreement had been 
reached on any issues that could be "tidied up." 
  "We had a long conversation," said the trade minister, who 
again reiterated what now is Norway's well-known position. 
According to Knudsen, the Swedish-Finnish alcohol solution is 
not so good that it might not still end up before the EU court. 
The Norwegian position is that the monopolies are already being 
scrutinized by the ESA, and that "we agree that this matter must 
be settled by a court." 
  The trade minister gave no sign of any Norwegian willingness 
to give way on any of the remaining issues in the negotiations 
-- and these are still quite numerous. But she also stressed 
that Norway wants to maintain a rapid pace in the negotiations 
in order to be able to negotiate in parallel with the three 
other applicant countries and hopefully complete the 
negotiations before the 1 March deadline. 
  Our new trade minister -- who because of her post is 
responsible for the negotiations with the EU -- is clearly 
working hard to get on top of her new job. By her own admission 
she needs -- and this only two weeks before the negotiations are 
planned to be completed -- to get to know the key figures on the 
EU side. That was why she met Van den Broek yesterday, and that 
is why she is traveling to Athens tomorrow to get to know Greek 
European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, because Greece 
has the responsibility for leading the negotiations on the EU 
side.

Flexibility"] 
  [Text] "The EU [European Union] Commission has tried to 
reach out a hand to Norway over the whaling issue -- but its 
gesture has not been reciprocated," an EU bureaucrat has said. 
  Laurens Brinkhorst, who is director general of the 
environmental protection directorate under the EU Commission, 
finds it hard to conceal his amazement at Norway's negotiating 
strategy. Instead of accepting an opt-out clause which would 
give Norway permission to catch whales for a two-year trial 
period, Norway has responded to the EU with total "radio 
silence," as he put it. 
  The Norwegian side takes the view that the proposal from the 
EU has not been made officially -- and that it is really only 
about the right of access which all have to opt-out arrangements 
in EU rules. The objection has been voiced that Norway will not 
be able to decide the future of Norwegian whaling independently, 
because the EU side will the whole time have a right of veto. 
  But given the way spokesmen for the Commission are now 
choosing their words, an opening is being left for Norway to 
continue whaling for minke whales for a two-year period. 
Thereafter there will be an environmental investigation of 
several criteria -- such as size of minke whale stocks, the 
amount of fish they eat, and so on. It will then be decided 
whether Norway can continue whaling. In the view of the European 
Commission, this means that a lifeline has been left. 
  Signals from central Norwegian sources in negotiating 
circles 
indicate that in the final phase of the EU negotiations Norway 
is willing to consider solutions like these that prevent a 
head-on collision between Norway and the EU. But the two sides 
have not as yet come to grips with each other in the 
negotiations proper. This could happen as early as tomorrow at 
one of the negotiating meetings in Brussels. 
  EU Director General Laurens Brinkhorst has already been to 
Norway and talked to Industry and Energy Minister Jens 
Stoltenberg and Environment Ministry Under Secretary of State 
Borre Pettersen, among others.

<F P=106> [Report by Rolf Gustavsson: "Spain Rejects Phasing-In"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- Without beating about, the bush Spain 
is rejecting Sweden's wish to be granted a phasing-in period for 
contributions to the EU [European Union] budget. 
  "Spain's position is very clear. We are opposed to a system 
under which Sweden's contribution to the EU's budget is phased 
in," Spanish Finance Minister Pedro Solbes told SVENSKA 
DAGBLADET. 
  "We have had such transitional arrangements in the past, but 
at that time there was also gradual integration into the EU 
system. Sweden will be a full member from day one and from this 
it follows that Sweden will have all the rights and all the 
duties of a member country from day one. 
  "I also understand that this is a very sensitive issue for 
Sweden and this is why I think that it will not be resolved 
until the final moments in the negotiations," said Spain's 
finance minister, who was formerly European affairs minister and 
one of those responsible for Spain's membership negotiations 
with the EU in the eighties. 
  Pedro Solbes also denied the reports published in THE 
FINANCIAL TIMES on Monday [14 February] that claimed that Spain 
had proposed that the new EU members' contributions to the EU's 
budget should go in their entirety to the four poorest member 
countries -- Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland. 
  "I have never seen such a proposal, and I think that the 
idea 
is totally idiotic," Pedro Solbes said. 
  Finance Minister Anne Wibble and Under Secretary of State 
Carl B. Hamilton are making a round-trip through the EU capitals 
to win sympathy for Sweden's budget demands. The first positive 
development in the finance minister's diplomatic mission could 
come today when she meets with Peter Schmidhuber, who is the EC 
commissioner responsible for the budget. The Commission has 
calculated the flow of money between Sweden and the EU in a way 
that is much more favorable for Sweden than the results the 
Swedish Finance Ministry has arrived at. 
  The Commission's calculations, which SVENSKA DAGBLADET 
reported on Saturday, predict that Sweden's contribution to the 
EU budget will be around 17 billion kronor -- around 5 million 
kronor less than Sweden's calculations. The Commission 
estimates the flow of money back to Sweden at around 12 billion 
kronor, while the Finance Ministry calculations are somewhere 
between 7 and 12 billion. According to the Commission, the net 
contribution from Sweden would therefore amount to 5 billion 
kronor per year -- something that looks like a happy calculation 
for Sweden. 
  The Swedish side is distrustful of the Commission's 
estimates, but if they do turn out to be correct the budget 
issue would suddenly become a relatively easy point in the 
negotiations. Perhaps Sweden would even drop its demand?

<F P=106> [Report by Ingrid Hedstrom: "Sweden Wants Zero Payment in </F>
First Year"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The government wants Sweden to make a 
zero payment to the EU [European Union] in the first year of 
Swedish membership. This is the size of the Swedish demand for 
a rebate upon accession that the government will soon be putting 
forward. 
  This was said by Finance Minister Anne Wibble, who visited 
Brussels yesterday after a tour of the EU capitals where she 
pleaded Sweden's case for a decreased membership contribution to 
the EU in the initial years of membership. 
  "A factor that we stressed and that was listened to with 
interest is that in no year does Sweden intend to be a burden on 
the EU's budget," Anne Wibble said. 
  "We will always be a net contributor even though to begin 
with our contribution is small or even zero." 
  According to Wibble, Sweden's regular membership 
contribution 
to the EU will end up "somewhere under 20 billion kronor" a 
year. Both sides' experts are sitting and making their 
calculations and their figures "are in the process of 
converging," the finance minister said. 
  But Sweden wants a phasing-in rebate, which means that only 
after a number of years will Sweden's membership contribution 
reach the full amount. The justification for this includes the 
arguments that other countries have been granted this and that 
Sweden has problems with its state finances. 
  According to a state report on the effects of EU membership, 
the flow of money back to Sweden from the EU could be 5 to 9 
billion kronor in agricultural support and around 2 million from 
the structural fund. Thus a Swedish zero payment would 
correspond to an initial rebate of around 50 percent. 
  But Anne Wibble is aware that in the final phase of 
negotiations a Swedish rebate demand could be played off against 
other demands close to Sweden's heart -- such as regional 
support for northern Sweden. 
  "This is exactly how discussions will go in the final phase. 
Obviously the whole picture is of significance in the final 
phase. 
  "Regional policy is of great political importance. My 
feelings about regional policy are very strong. 
  "But it is important to achieve a good solution on both 
issues. We could not swap regional support for the budget 
rebate." 
  In the past, European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel has 
said several times that the Swedish negotiators want to see what 
they will get back from the EU before Sweden produces an 
official negotiating stance on the budget.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Meanwhile the satellite war between 
Norway and Sweden continues. We've reported before on Norway's 
purchase of Britain's Marco Polo-2 satellite, which was 
repositioned at 1 degree west and renamed Thor. [passage 
omitted] 
  On the other hand, the Swedish Space Corporation and Swedish 
Telecom have succeeded in buying the Marco Polo-1 satellite and 
is moving to position it together with Sweden's Tele-X at 5 
degrees east. The Norwegians tried to block the sale in the 
British courts, since the two Marco Polo satellites operate on 
the same frequencies, and being placed so close together there 
may be interference. Since Sweden holds the rights to the 
frequencies and Norway doesn't, that's also a problem for the 
Norwegians. The move even prompted Norway to shift from the 
obscure D-MAC system for the Thor channels to the much more 
common D2-MAC system. 
  Now, a consortium in Malaysia is threatening to sue British 
Sky Broadcasting for selling the satellite to the Swedes. The 
Malaysians say they offered more, but Sky wouldn't sell because 
the satellite would have been competition for Star TV, the huge 
Asian satellite broadcaster owned by the same company that owns 
Sky. 
  So far, the Swedish Space Corporation hasn't said what 
channels may be on its new satellite, which has been renamed 
Sirius. It's been moving from its old position and should have 
passed Thor yesterday and should be in its final position on 20 
February. 
  And now, the latest crazy twist to the story. The four 
largest Nordic cable operators, including Swedish Telecom's 
cable company, and counterparts in Norway and Denmark, and the 
Helsinki Media Company from Finland, have started a joint 
company to distribute satellite channels via the Intelsat 
positioned with Thor. The new company is called Nordic 
Satellite Distribution, and hopes to compete with Astra. Claes 
Gustavsson is information director at Swedish Telecom's cable 
subsidiary. 
  [Begin recording] [Gustavsson] Well, what we're doing is 
we're trying to bring the four largest companies in Scandinavia 
together, actually the largest cable TV operator in each country 
together, and form a large company that will be stronger, a 
stronger unit in every sense, to just get a better programming 
out for everybody and see if we can work together. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] So you'll be picking up TV 
channels and relaying them over the Intelsat-702 satellite which 
is being launched later this year? 
  [Gustavsson] Yeah, that's what we're going to do. And 
actually we're trying to, you know, we're entering into this, to 
the DTH [direct to home] (?or) satellite dish market with this, 
and see if we can get everything to come out from just one 
position. So, today, probably most households of Sweden needs 
probably at least three different dishes or one motorized one, 
to get probably the 10 most popular channels, but by doing this 
they can get everything from one position. 
  [Correspondent] How many channels are you planning on 
relaying? 
  [Gustavsson] Oh, as many as possible -- we're not, you know, 
we don't know at this point, but this, of course, is also 
looking into digital compression and what's going to happen with 
that. 
  [Correspondent] What channels are you planning on? 
  [Gustavsson] Actually everything we carry now, whatever is 
available in Sweden or in Denmark and Finland, plus the largest 
channels there are, CNN, BBC, etc., the movie channels, probably 
the 30 most popular channels in Scandinavia. 
  [Correspondent] So you must be taking the entire capacity of 
that satellite, if you're going to carry 30 channels? 
  [Gustavsson] Well, that has to do, of course, with digital 
compression and how that's going to work and how long this will 
take. 
  [Correspondent] So, you're putting all this in at 1 degree 
west, but there's already a satellite at 1 degree west, Thor, 
which is actually owned by Norwegian Telecom, who offer a packet 
of channels, so you'll be competing with them. 
  [Gustavsson] Well, the way we look, at this point we're not 
looking at competing with anybody, we're more looking at as, as, 
well, as trying to widen or broaden the market and get much more 
households involved, that's what we're trying to do right now, 
so we're just basically meeting with everybody and see how we 
can work together to get more people to either have, you know, 
satellite dishes or cable TV. 
  [Correspondent] (?Because) meanwhile over at 5 degrees east 
we've got Sweden's Tele-X satellite and Swedish Telecom and the 
Space Corporation have bought and are moving the Marco Polo-1 
satellite there, they're going to call it Sirius and offer a 
satellite package as well. So it seems like we've got two 
different Scandinavian hot bird positions competing against 
themselves here. 
  [Gustavsson] Yeah, that's how it looks right now, but what 
we're doing is just basically meeting and discussing how to, you 
know, how to make this as, as possible for the customers and 
just trying to look at it as a way of developing the market and 
take a step forward there, instead of looking at it as a 
situation of competition at this point. 
  [Correspondent] When are you planning on actually beginning 
operations? 
  [Gustavsson] Well, we're hoping for this fall at the latest. 
But right now, well, like I said, we're meeting with everybody 
and then negotiating and then (?talking), getting through (?to 
your) additional parts etc, and trying to see where we stand. 
[end recording]

Cypriot side will attend tomorrow's proximity talks with clear 
positions, goodwill, and honesty. 
  Speaking this afternoon in Nicosia, Mikhailidhis added that 
if the other side shows the same goodwill we can move forward 
and reach an agreement on the confidence-building measures, 
which would be the beginning of a solution to the Cyprus 
problem. Mikhailidhis called on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas to abandon his demands for separate sovereign rights. 
He added that European Union observer Serge Abou is expected in 
Cyprus next Monday [21 February].

  [Text] The proximity talks on the confidence-building 
measures began today in Nicosia with a meeting between President 
Glavkos Kliridhis and UN officials. Joe Clark, the UN secretary 
general's special representative in Cyprus, headed the UN 
delegation. The meeting lasted two and a half hours. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Clark said that Kliridhis 
and the UN officials had a preliminary talk on all the key 
points and added they will do the same during their meeting with 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas this afternoon. Clark said: 
I do not want to define where we stand point by point. He 
described the discussion as useful and said it is completely in 
line with the positive developments and goodwill shown by both 
sides so far. 
  Asked whether they discussed the map, Clark said they looked 
at some maps and will surely look at some more. Asked whether 
there was an agreement on the maps, Clark said the UN officials 
noted the position they were presented with and will consider it 
as the procedure develops. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said our side is 
attending the proximity talks in goodwill and a constructive 
spirit, aiming to reach an agreement within the four 
prerequisites set by the UN secretary general. He mentioned 
that some procedural issues were discussed at the meeting and 
our side explained its positions on significant issues such as 
handing over Famagusta's fenced-off area to UN control and the 
opening of Nicosia Airport. 
  Kasoulidhis noted that our side did not make any suggestions 
that fall outside the four UN secretary general's prerequisites. 
He added that safe movement to and from Famagusta and security 
in Famagusta's fenced-off area during the return of residents 
and during the work to reconstruct the city are high on our 
side's agenda and are considered necessary prerequisites for the 
success of the talks. Our side made suggestions on these issues. 
  Our side also raised the issue of the timeframe in which 
Famagusta's fenced-off area should be handed over to the United 
Nations, the time during which the legal residents will be able 
to get back their property in the first phase, and the time 
during which the legal residents will be able to get back their 
property in the second phase in conjunction with the timeframe 
for opening Nicosia Airport. 
  The spokesman mentioned that our side raised various issues 
on the opening of Nicosia Airport, always keeping in mind the UN 
secretary general's four prerequisites. It also discussed with 
the UN envoys some of its positions on Butrus-Ghali's first 
document, which refers to 14 confidence-building measures. 
Kasoulidhis said: We have not exhausted our positions on many 
issues. We will do this tomorrow and we will wait to hear the 
other side's views. 
  Answering a question, Kasoulidhis said that Kliridhis raised 
with the UN representatives the issue of Famagusta's fenced-off 
area map and asked that the United Nations present a more 
detailed and accurate map to the two sides as soon as possible 
so that both sides could agree on the map that would be used in 
the talks. The UN representatives will present the map by 
tomorrow. Kasoulidhis mentioned that he will release the map 
that the United Nations gave to the government last May, adding 
that it was small and did not present the area clearly and with 
details. 
  In a statement before the meeting, Clark said progress has 
been made and added that there has been an agreement in 
principle on the confidence-building measures and an agreement 
on how we will proceed. Clark said: I hope we will be able to 
draw a clearer picture on how the two sides approach the key 
points and discuss them with the two leaders. I intend to 
discuss all the key points to make as much progress as possible 
today. I believe there is a basis for some optimism because we 
have made some progress. The challenge is to maintain this 
progress in a way acceptable to both sides. Clark said: This 
is just one phase of the procedure. Success on the 
confidence-building measures opens the door to success on the 
most basic issues. 
  Answering a question on whether he will not deal with the 
first of the seven points on the agenda, Clark said he intends 
to deal with all the issues today. He said: In every meeting 
we will define the specific order we will follow. I believe it 
is important to clarify from the start that we intend to deal 
with all the points at every meeting. Asked whether Famagusta's 
map, which is printed today in some newspapers, is the true one, 
Clark said he did not see the map. 
  The UN envoys will meet Denktas this afternoon.

  [Text] "It is time to stop playing the dangerous game of 
`all or nothing' and see if we can make some progress with the 
Cyprus issue movement toward its final solution." 
  This is the philosophy with which President Glavkos 
Kliridhis 
approaches the discussion of the confidence-building measures, 
which he has explained to various political officials. 
  The president estimates that international circles are 
determined to press for the implementation of the 
confidence-building measures, considering them the beginning of 
the solution of the Cyprus issue. 
  In the meantime, political circles make the following 
assessment: If there is no agreement on the "most important" 
issues and aspects of the problem this time, the Cyprus issue 
will remain unsettled in the long run and there will be gradual 
legalization of the current situation through the recognition of 
the pseudostate. 
  The same political circles stressed that in a period when 
the 
international community has recognized almost 20 new states and 
ministates, it will not be particularly sensitive about 
recognizing one more.

  [Text] The Hague, Feb 17 (AFP) -- Greece has closed its 
land border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
after closing its main supply route through the Greek port of 
Salonika, the Dutch foreign ministry said Thursday [17 February]. 
  Spokesman Djoeke Koekoek said a number of trucks, including 
some registered in the Netherlands, had been stopped by Greek 
border guards from crossing into Macedonia. 
  The government here was alerted by the Dutch association of 
international transporters, EVO, after receiving a flood of 
telephone calls from drivers stuck at the border. 
  EVO demanded late Thursday that Athens let the trucks 
through, threatening to send the Greeks the bill for the lost 
business otherwise. It advised its members to start transiting 
though Bulgaria, Hungary or Romania. 
  Since the start of the Yugoslav civil war most trucks from 
the Netherlands have gone by ferry to Greek ports from Brindisi 
in southern Italy. 
  Greece Wednesday closed its port of Salonika to Macedonian 
goods, severing its northern neighbour's main lifeline. There 
was no immediate word from Athens on the Dutch charges on 
Thursday. 
  Greece accuses Macedonia of usurping a name which Athens 
says 
is solely part of Greek heritage and of harbouring expansionist 
ambitions over the Greek province of the same name. 
  Dutch European Affairs Minister Piet Dunkert made a brief 
visit to Athens Thursday for talks with his Greek counterpart 
Theodoros Pangalos which included the Greek measures against 
Macedonia. 
  An aide to the minister said that if Greece closed more 
ports 
it could mean an infringement of European law on goods in 
transit.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou clarified that 
our country is ready for talks with Skopje, but remains firm on 
the issue of the state's name. [passage omitted] 
  Asked whether Greece violates international law with the 
measures against Skopje, government spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos said the Greek Government calmly and carefully 
examined all aspects, both legal and political. On the goods 
that are allowed to move from Thessaloniki port to and from 
Skopje, Venizelos said the National Economy Ministry will issue 
a circular with instructions based on the decisions made by the 
government yesterday. The ministry will define the scope of the 
customs authorities' authority. He said, however, that there is 
a complete ban excluding only diplomatic, UN, and CSCE 
delegations. [passage omitted] 
  Diplomatic correspondent Mirella Kalostipi reported a short 
time ago that with the adoption of measures against Skopje, the 
Greek Government aims to make this state realize its provocative 
stance toward Greece. According to reliable information, the 
measures may become even harsher if Skopje continues its 
intransigence. The Greek side is convinced that the specific 
measures do not violate either European or international law. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou today said that 
Skopje should finally get reasonable. Asked whether the 
measures were adopted at the wrong time, Papandreou said the 
time was wrong for various countries to recognize Skopje. 
Mentioning that there is a crisis in Athens-Skopje relations, 
Papandreou said he hopes a solution is found through this 
crisis. He added that the Greek Government believes the 
measures will lead more directly and effectively to a solution 
of the problem. [passage omitted] 
  Asked how much the measures against Skopje will affect the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the possible bombing, the 
government spokesman said the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
NATO decisions have no connection with Skopje.

  [Excerpts] Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert met 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou at 1400 today in the Maximos 
Palace. Afterward, Evert told correspondents that he and the 
prime minister discussed the sphere of our national issues, 
which are intense these days. Evert said he could not detail 
the discussion. He said: I will say only that New Democracy, as 
a national party, will keep the national front firm. The 
official opposition leader noted that he was not satisfied with 
all the answers and thoughts raised in his talks with the prime 
minister. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos stressed: The Greek 
Government will not brief foreign governments on its decision 
[concerning relations with Skopje], which was made within the 
framework of national sovereignty and with great wisdom. But 
the spokesman did say that Foreign Ministry Secretary General 
Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis will brief the permanent members 
of the UN Security Council. Venizelos made it clear that 
humanitarian aid is excluded from the trade blockade of Skopje. 
The blockade includes shipments that are in transit through 
Greece unless such transport involves items from diplomatic, 
United Nations, and CSCE missions on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] 
  Greece warns that stronger measures will be implemented 
unless Skopje's intransigence is bent. Greece is also preparing 
to refute--on a political and legal level--the objections by the 
European partners and the United States. The main axis of the 
Greek argument will be that Greece follows international law. 
Reference will also be made to the articles of the European 
Unification Treaty that give member countries the right to 
invoke action for reasons of particular national interest. 
  Reportedly, there is already a report at the prime 
minister's 
office and at Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' office. It 
was prepared by the legal department of the Foreign Ministry and 
includes the arguments the Greek representatives will put 
forward abroad and with international organizations.

  [Text] Commerce and Industry Minister Konstandinos Simitis 
said today that there will be a full embargo on fuel for Skopje 
and stressed that there would be no repercussions for our 
economy over the measures against Skopje. Vasilis Tzovaras has 
the following report: 
  [Begin Tzovaras recording] The embargo on Skopje will be 
implemented normally for all Greek products sent to this 
statelet, while our country will not give its consent to the 
granting of any Community loan unless Skopje changes its policy. 
This statement was made today by Commerce and Industry Minister 
Konstandinos Simitis, who made it clear that the embargo against 
Skopje would have no repercussions for our country's foreign 
trade and the smooth channeling of supplies to our market. The 
Panhellenic Exporters Association agrees with Simitis' 
assessments while the North Greece Exporters Association 
expresses the opposite view. 
  As to why the transportation trade and our country's general 
foreign trade would not be affected by the embargo on Skopje, 
Simitis said that for about two years now, the passage through 
Skopje of goods being exported from or imported to Greece has 
virtually been reduced to nothing because of the situation in 
the former Yugoslavia and mainly after the implementation of the 
UN embargo on particular statelets of the former Yugoslavia. 
The transport of goods is being carried out primarily through 
Italy or Bulgaria and with preference given to Italy after 
recent developments in mixed transportation. 
  Our country's foreign trade with the statelet of Skopje is 
slight: In 1992, goods worth $9 million were imported and items 
worth $16 million were exported. During the first 10 months of 
1993, the imports from Skopje were $12 million and the exports 
$108 million. This big variation in exports is due to the 
supply of large quantities of oil from Greece to Skopje last 
year. Skopje recently bought large quantities of fuel, much 
more than it could consume, Simitis confirmed, and probably 
built up some reserves, possibly disposing of the surplus in 
favor of third parties, that is, reselling it. [end recording] 
  On the implementation of the embargo, our Thessaloniki 
correspondent Dhespina Khari has the following report: 
  [Begin Khari recording] Three ships that sailed into 
Thessaloniki port this morning with cargo destined for the 
statelet of Skopje were not unloaded because the members of the 
Thessaloniki Port Authority longshoremen's association refused 
to unload the cargo. The loading of fuel [words indistinct] for 
Skopje has already stopped, while no foreign freighter appeared 
outside the Kalokhori installations to load fuel. 
  According to Thessaloniki Port Authority records, 3,000 tons 
of crude oil were leaving the port daily for Skopje while 1 
million tons of dry cargo was loaded and unloaded at its 
installations for Skopje or was coming from this statelet for 
export. Skopje's products were in transit at Thessaloniki port. 
The dry cargo was stored in warehouses and the liquid fuel 
unloaded from tankers was stored in private companies' tanks due 
to leave for the statelet by rail. The oil and its products, 
which until yesterday were transported from Thessaloniki port by 
tanker or other means, were the lever of power for this 
statelet's industry and communications and its heating 
requirements. 
  The administrative council of the Thessaloniki Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry passed a resolution assessing that the 
measures the Greek Government announced concerning the Skopje 
issue--the suspension of the operation of our country's 
consulate in Skopje and a ban on the use of Thessaloniki port 
for freight to and from Skopje--is a necessary consequence of 
the premature recognition of this republic. The resolution of 
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry stresses: We believe the 
Greek Government could have made no other decision while [words 
indistinct] the process of recognition was cultivating Skopje's 
intransigence. [end recording]

  [Text] The Greek Government's decision to impose an 
economic embargo against Skopje has caused diplomatic tension 
and marathon international deliberations. At the same time, 
Athens warns that it will impose stricter measures if Skopje 
does not stop its intransigence. Athens is also preparing to 
counter the charges from the European partners and Washington at 
the political and diplomatic level. 
  At the same time, the Greek immigrant community in Canada 
has 
expressed its enthusiasm for the actions and has sent 
congratulatory letters to Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou. The overwhelming majority of voters in Greece agree 
with the measures imposed. According to an opinion poll 
conducted by private research companies in Attiki following the 
prime minister's announcement, 67 percent of those asked agreed 
with the measures. Consequently, according to political 
commentaries, there is overwhelming support for the government 
actions.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial report] Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) 
officials view the April party congress as a "dress rehearsal" 
for the future congress that will determine Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou's succession, writes Stavros Liyeros in the 
30 January Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. Given the widespread 
belief that the PASOK congress will be the last under 
Papandreou's leadership, potential successors will make no moves 
likely to threaten the prime minister's position. They will 
focus instead on shaping the balance of power most favorable to 
each of them, Liyeros continues. For this reason, the battle 
will mainly center on the composition of the new central 
committee. Meanwhile, alliances are forming to promote the 
chances of each candidate. One of the main factions, composed of 
Finance Minister Yiorgos Yennimatas, Environment Minister Kostas 
Laliotis, and Industry, Energy and Technology Minister Kostas 
Simitis, has attracted a number of high officials. Vaso 
Papandreou, PASOK deputy and former EC commissioner, is among 
them, but is not yet viewed as an equal partner by the others, 
Liyeros affirms. The Yennimatas-Laliotis-Simitis "axis" is 
counterbalanced by Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis. While his 
influence on the party apparatus is "significant," it is 
insufficient to ensure him "first place" in the succession 
battle, for many see him as a "black sheep" for founding his own 
party--now disbanded--after being proscribed by PASOK in the 
1980's, Liyeros writes. 
  Another pole of attraction is Interior Minister Akis 
Tsokhatzopoulos, who has "impressively" strengthened his bases 
of support within the party apparatus after his election as 
PASOK central committee secretary. Since Tsokhatzopoulos until 
recently was not considered a potential successor to Papandreou, 
it was believed his power would wane with the prime minister's 
exit from active politics. This widespread impression has now 
given way to the belief that the interior minister is attempting 
to firm up his position both within the party and the 
government, with a view to claiming the PASOK leadership. 
  Minister to the Prime Minister Andonios Livanis, 
Papandreou's 
"closest aide, completes the square," Liyeros writes. Having 
played a "determining" role in the cabinet appointments, he has 
attracted significant support both from the PASOK parliamentary 
group and the party apparatus. While Livanis nourishes no 
leadership ambitions, he will play a principal role in the 
struggle for succession because of his ability to influence the 
prime minister, as well as a large group of "Andreists," Liyeros 
contends. While relations between Arsenis, Tsokhatzopoulos, and 
Livanis are not "excellent," the three share Papandreou as a 
point of reference and will surely conform to his wishes as long 
as he remains in power, only breaking ranks on the succession 
issue, Liyeros contends. 
  Although the Yennimatas-Laliotis-Simitis alliance had 
attempted until recently to limit Tsokhatzopoulos' influence in 
the party, it seems they have had "second thoughts," Liyeros 
continues. The three officials are attempting to reach an 
understanding with the interior minister in order to "isolate" 
Arsenis, and thus will not oppose his immediate reelection as 
central committee secretary. Nevertheless, their long-term goal 
is to elect a party chairman and secretary of their own 
choosing, with Tsokhatzopoulos remaining a "figurehead" as 
deputy party leader. PASOK party members gathered around the 
trio will surely support Yennimatas for party chairman and 
Laliotis for secretary when the time comes, Liyeros contends, 
adding that the sole uncertain factor is Yennimatas' health, 
which may not allow him to run. An intermediate solution may 
then be sought with the support of such PASOK luminaries as 
Minister to the Prime Minister Anastasios Peponis and deputy 
Apostolos Kaklamanis, Liyeros concludes.

<F P=106> [Article by Athens University Professor Kostas Kalogris: </F>
"Inflation's `Low 
Blows'"] 
  [Excerpts] In the last 15 years, inflation in Greece has 
been particularly long-lived and impervious to austerity and 
other anti-inflationary measures. Inflation stood at 12.3 
percent at the end of last year, with an average yearly rate of 
13.8 percent, or quadruple the average rate in other European 
Union member countries (3.2 percent). [passage omitted] 
  The principal structural causes for Greek inflation are: 
  1. The nature of national expenditures, 
characterized today by a high rate of consumption and a low rate 
of savings for investment purposes. The consumerist nature of 
national expenditures stems from the strong consumer habits of 
the Greeks, notably those involved in the underground economy 
who siphon off nearly half of the national income, which thus 
remains untaxed and is used instead to purchase 
luxury--especially imported--goods. Another cause is the strong 
consumerist character of public expenditures, most of which go 
toward servicing the public debt, whose nature is also 
inflationary. 
  2. The rate of savings/investments and their 
nature. The rate of savings in Greece (15.5 percent) is 
small in comparison with that of other EU countries (20 
percent). In addition, part of the savings remains "sterile" in 
bank vaults and remains outside the productive process because 
of the high interest rates paid to depositors and, more 
generally, because of unfavorable bank loan terms and the 
difficult access of commercial companies--notably small-and 
medium-sized firms--to the capital market. 
  On the other hand, part of the "potential" investment funds 
from accumulated savings is channeled into very attractive 
income-producing sources, such as state bonds and high-interest 
private loans (half of the Greeks lend to the other half), 
rather than into production. 
  As a result of the nature of national savings, only 18.1 
percent of GDP is channeled into production, despite the fact 
that investments in the 23-25 percent range are needed to 
support the development rate (4 percent) needed to achieve the 
goals of the Greek economy. 
  However, the problem stems not only from the low rate of 
investment, but also from its nature. The largest share of 
investment is channeled into low-productivity projects such as 
construction and small equipment, while little goes to research, 
innovation, and improvement of human resources through education 
and training. 
  The result of the low rate of investment and its inadequate 
nature is the slow expansion rate of market potential and 
productivity, leading to "gaps" in production and in supply 
versus demand, as well as to supply-side inflationary pressures. 
  3. The basic nature of the Greek economy, 
characterized by overdevelopment in the field of what is mainly 
middleman services, the small size of companies, excessive state 
participation in production, low rates of capital accumulation 
and modernization, repeated strike-induced interruptions in the 
production process, absenteism, network and infrastructural 
dysfunctions, etc. 
  4. The size and nature of the public debt. With a 
public debt amounting to 145 percent of GNP, Greece is on the 
brink of overindebtedness. However, the size of the debt is not 
so important as its nature. Greece's public debt increased 
spectacularly after 1980 in order to satisfy the sometimes 
justified and sometimes irresponsible consumption demands of 
various groups and of the government, but not the needs of 
development, which may briefly give rise to inflationary 
pressures, but also creates the possibility of absorbing such 
pressures in the medium- and long-term through the national 
product it generates. 
  As a result, the size and especially the nature of Greece's 
public debt presently function as a strong structural source of 
inflationary pressures and inflation. 
  5. The nature of the budgets has been inflationary 
for a number of years, with the exception of one or two. The 
reasons for this inflationary trend are, on the one hand, 
increasing expenditures in conjunction with structural 
weaknesses of public expenditures and, on the other hand, a 
revenue gap. This gap is caused by the citizenry's weak 
conscience toward paying taxes, the poor structure of the tax 
system, the lack of efficient tax mechanisms, and the escape of 
a significant share of the national income--notably the profits 
from the underground economy--as well as the not uncommon resort 
to printing money under the pressure of inelastic financial 
needs. 
  6. The nature of the markets and the social 
structure. Because of the existence of business oligopolies 
and the lack of healthy competition, the markets for good and 
services, capital, labor, and others are "inflexible" and 
"protect" themselves through frequent price increases. 
  In addition, Greece's social structure is characterized by 
deep fragmentation in strongly competing social groups 
(physicians, lawyers, tradesmen, businessmen, trade unionists, 
etc.) that aim at satisfying "selfish" interests often 
incompatible with behavioral patterns serving the national 
interest. 
  Thus, both the nature of the markets and the social 
structure 
lead to tendencies of higher prices, which have strong 
repercussions on costs of production, and hence to inflation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Klaus </F>
Bresser and Klaus-Peter Siegloch; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Siegloch] Mr. Kohl, there are more important 
issues than the election campaign in Germany. A war is going on 
in the center of Europe, in the former Yugoslavia. On Monday 
[21 February] the NATO ultimatum is going to expire. Would you 
also be in favor of air strikes if the Serbs were to fail to 
completely withdraw their heavy weapons by then? 
  [Kohl] Yes, I have said right from the beginning that I 
think that the decision that NATO made, also with our support, 
is right. Still, I think that in the hours until Monday every 
chance should be used to bring some reason to the situation, 
even in the very last minute. 
  [Bresser] The situation is deteriorating. You have just 
talked to President Clinton on the telephone, and yesterday to 
President Yeltsin, and you are planning to talk to him on the 
phone again tomorrow morning. If air strikes are actually 
carried out on Bosnian territory will the Russians permit the 
situation to escalate to a conflict? 
  [Kohl] Nobody can say that exactly. Together with others, I 
am trying to convince the Russian leadership, above all Boris 
Yeltsin himself, that the present state of affairs is 
intolerable. 
  [Bresser] He is not convinced yet? 
  [Kohl] I cannot quite say that for sure, at the moment, but 
there is tremendous domestic pressure. After all, Russia is the 
old protective power for the Serbs. There is great pressure in 
Moscow, in parliament, and elsewhere. Still, I think it is 
important that we now take advantage of the excellent contacts 
that have developed, not least between the U.S. and the Russian 
presidents, and also with us. One of the problems that I see is 
the psychological situation, something that is difficult to pin 
down. Russia is not part of NATO, Russia is no longer the Soviet 
Union. The time when NATO and the Warsaw Pact were standing face 
to face is over. Now there are major psychological problems, 
and Russia is wondering whether the West will act unilaterally. 
This has a lot to do with Russia's prestige and pride. And I 
think that talks in this connection are still necessary. 
  [Siegloch] Still, many people here are asking themselves: 
What will Germany's role be? Can we really keep out of it if 
things continue to deteriorate. Considering the dying in 
Bosnia, do we not, at least, have to provide medical units? 
  [Kohl] Well, first of all, the constitutional situation 
remains the way it is, at least in principle. I regret that, 
and if I had had my way we would have changed the constitution a 
long time ago. I regard the current situation as absolutely 
impossible and unbearable. We are all, not least the foreign 
minister and I, constantly finding ourselves in most awkward 
situations. We give advice and questions then remain in the air. 
So far we have encountered a lot of understanding for our 
situation. However, it will not stay like that. We will have a 
decision from Karlsruhe in the foreseeable future, and I hope it 
is a decision that will finally restore our ability to act. 
That is one thing. 
  The other is that, even if our constitution had been changed 
or interpreted as I would like, the question remains whether, 
after the historic events between 1941 and 1945, the Germans 
would now be the proper partners. 
  [Siegloch] Not even by providing medical units? 
  [Kohl] I will come back to this issue. I am now speaking 
generally regarding combat forces which I am not in favor of it. 
I have always said that, and I think history is still very much 
alive in this connection. It is a completely different matter 
where decisions have to be made about what we can do to help, 
for example as far as logistical support is concerned, which 
might, of course, include medical support. In that case, I 
would be in favor of going to the very limit of what is possible. 
  [Bresser] Does that also mean the Bosnian border, or are you 
thinking of logistical support within Bosnia? 
  [Kohl] This would then have to be considered very carefully. 
Still, I want the world to realize that the Germans also want to 
help if they get involved, particularly in the sphere of 
humanitarian help that benefits people. 
  [Bresser] Mr. Chancellor, foreign policy could become an 
issue in the election campaign, particularly if extremist forces 
were to seize power in Russia. With a view to the ultimatum, 
Zhirinovskiy has once more threatened World War III. Do people 
here need to be scared again? 
  [Kohl] I think that one thing has become clear -- it has 
been clear all the time but has become more obvious again now -- 
namely that we did not enter a peaceful world overnight, but 
that the evil spirits that have dominated this century are not 
dead, and they do not only reside in the Balkans but can 
emigrate from there at any time. Specifically, for me this 
means that, despite all problems in terms of domestic policy, 
what Bismarck said remains true --that a country's peace and 
freedom, and, we would add today, its prosperity -- depend on 
foreign and security policy. We can do what we like in domestic 
policy, but as long as peace and freedom are not protected it 
will all have been in vain. There are now six years to go to 
the end of the century, a century that has witnessed enough 
misery, suffering, and death, and we must now do everything to 
take what precautions we can. That is why I am such a 
passionate advocate of European unification. Not first and 
foremost because of the most important economic advantages we 
can derive from Europe, but because only a really unified Europe 
that is able to act jointly in foreign, security, and military 
policy -- along with the Americans in NATO, for example -- only 
such a Europe can prevent war in our region. This is the most 
important argument for European unification. 
  [Siegloch] Chancellor, this is an election year. Whether 
foreign policy will play a central role, remains to be seen. In 
any case, unemployment will play a central role. For the first 
time, there are more than 4 million unemployed, and many more 
people fear that they might lose their jobs. When will it get 
better, when will the number of unemployed go down again? 
  [Kohl] The problem we are now facing is that failures are 
becoming apparent that have built up over many years, failures 
by almost all groups. It has not been a normal recession as we 
usually have it every eight, nine, or 10 years. If that were 
the case we would get out of it fairly quickly. What we are 
experiencing now are structural weaknesses becoming apparent. 
And we can only stop and cut unemployment if we start making 
decisions now, in spite of it being an election year, that will 
improve our situation and start thinking anew. Anybody who 
talks about maintaining the status quo will lose the future. 
There are many examples of this. Just think of the many issues 
that have not been dealt with over the years, like privatization 
of the post office and railroad. That means modernization, new 
jobs -- tens of thousands in the post office -- 
telecommunications technology. This means something quite 
specific. The legal framework has been created. And now we will 
have to work on it. Take the Dutch, whose situation is similar 
to ours which allows comparisons. Some 34-35 percent of Dutch 
jobs are part-time. In Germany it is just under 15 percent. We 
have 2.5 million people in Germany who work full time but would 
like to work part time. We could introduce these jobs tomorrow. 
All the conditions are there, if the companies, employers, 
employees, and the state as well -- we have made our mistakes as 
well, we have not done enough, I have now given the whole thing 
a push -- if we did a bit more about it. Let me just say 
something about part-time work, because this is often 
misunderstood: There could be other solutions, it need not be 
either in the morning or afternoon. It could be various days, a 
week in a row. There are plenty of ideas. 
  [Siegloch] But this will only solve part of the basic 
problem. Even if the economy picks up, unemployment will stay. 
Production is increased, with the number of jobs declining. 
Companies might also move to the cheaper countries. 
  [Kohl] We can, of course, do something about that. 
  [Siegloch] What is the government doing about whole sectors 
of the population being paralyzed, so to speak, because they are 
out of work on a permanent basis? 
  [Kohl] First of all, we have to clarify something. Creating 
jobs is not primarily something the government has to do, but it 
is something that concerns everybody. It is above all an issue 
industry has to deal with. The government has to create 
framework conditions. 
  [Bresser] Economic policy is made by the economy. Do you 
share this view? 
  [Kohl] Economic policy is made by the economy to a very 
great extent, with the economy also meaning the partners in pay 
negotiations. We are one of the two important exporting 
countries in the world, the second after Japan. Up to now we 
have always regarded Asia as competition: Taiwan, the People's 
Republic of China, Hong Kong. Now we have competition on our 
doorstep; and we want to have it there. We want the Russians to 
come to terms with the market economy and democracy, just like 
the Poles, the Hungarians, the Czechs, the Slovaks. One does 
not have to go to Taiwan to compare wages. I have just looked 
at a big company working in both countries. A metalworker in 
Mannheim earns 46 German marks [DM] an hour, his counterpart in 
Brno [Czech Republic] gets DM3. 
  [Bresser] Does this mean you are in favor of cutting wages? 
  [Kohl] No, this would not get us any further. Wages in the 
Czech Republic will go up as well. No, we must do a number of 
things in saving wages and ancillary wage costs. We must have 
new ideas. It is quite absurd that until recently we have had 
the shortest machine operating hours -- this is now beginning to 
change. This is a homemade German problem. Among the 12 EU 
countries, we are in 11th with the most expensive machinery and 
particularly short operating hours. All of a sudden, there are 
examples: the big car manufacturer in Kaiserslautern, where 
completely new shift systems are being introduced, and where 
greater continuity in production is being achieved. All of us 
-- and I say this without blaming anybody -- will have to ask 
ourselves whether during the past 20 years we did not think too 
little about the future. And this is the only way to cut 
unemployment, or to get it to a more acceptable level. We will 
not be able to do away with it altogether in the foreseeable 
future. 
  [Siegloch] Mr. Chancellor, you have called for longer 
machine-running times -- O.K. But you have also said that we 
should all work longer hours. On the other hand, people at 
Volkswagen have said that the reduced amount of work has to be 
distributed more evenly. So who is right? 
  [Kohl] I do not see a contradiction here. Volkswagen has 
not offered a permanent solution -- after all, we are talking of 
unemployment over an extended period of time -- but a temporary 
solution. The other question can easily be answered when one 
looks at demographic figures. For almost 30 years we have been 
the country with the lowest birthrate in the world. We can be 
proud of positive developments as far as health care is 
concerned. In the year 2000 we will have more than 3 million 
citizens above the age of 80. Look at these developments: a 
reduction -- a major reduction -- in the number of children that 
are born. We no longer have a population pyramid, and there are 
many more elderly people. When I also look at the fact that 
last year -- 1993 --the average retirement age of men was 59; 
when I see that university graduates in the natural sciences are 
30 years old when they enter professional life; that means 30 
years of training, 30 years of professional life, and 20 years 
of average life expectancy in retirement; this makes 50 against 
30 years, and that cannot work out. 
  [Siegloch] As far as pensions are concerned you are 
certainly right. Yet if we all were to work harder and longer 
hours, could we then not make do with even a smaller work force? 
  [Kohl] We need a larger work force. There are many areas 
where we do not yet have sufficient labor. We are engaged in an 
-- excuse my language -- idiotic controversy over the 
nursing-care insurance. 
  [Bresser] We will come back to that. 
  [Kohl] Let us discuss the nursing-care insurance now. 
People are getting older, the number of single people has 
dramatically increased: in many big German cities more than 50 
percent of all households. It means that the generation that is 
now becoming older will also require nursing-care, because the 
traditional family structures no longer exist. At the moment we 
have 30 days of annual leave, and 12-14 holidays. This makes 
eight weeks of vacation --one of the longest periods of vacation 
in the world. And now we are arguing about two holidays; we 
should not abolish them but just not pay wages for them, or 
those who so choose could give up two days of annual leave. 
  [Bresser] Mr. Chancellor, this is a good example of what 
people mean when they say today that nothing is going on in Bonn 
any more, no problems are being tackled. The question is why 
have you haven't long since reached agreement with the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] on the issue of the nursing-care 
insurance, because what the SPD is meanwhile requesting is 
exactly what your Minister Bluem originally proposed? 
  [Kohl] Excuse me, we have failed to reach agreement with the 
SPD on two issues, because the SPD has made it a dogma that wage 
payments cannot be suspended for two holidays. This is a 
position that I absolutely cannot understand. I am in favor of 
protecting the system of autonomous wage negotiations. Still, 
this system would not collapse if we said that we need the wages 
of two holidays for nursing-care insurance. And here comes the 
SPD's second objection, something that Bluem made clear in his 
earlier calculations: One unpaid holiday might just be enough 
for the time being -- for the time being. Yet, what about the 
future? I am strictly against putting any new additional burden 
on the economy, particularly on medium-sized businesses. We 
will soon see that calculations that have been made so far were 
much too tight -- this is always the case in the sphere of 
social policy -- and that we will need more. 
  [Siegloch] But, Mr. Chancellor, why do you not simply make a 
start. The first step could be to finance nursing-care in 
people's homes through one day of unpaid leave. And then you 
could say that in two or three years one could look how it is 
working and maybe revise the calculations? 
  [Kohl] Well, in two or three years this would, of course, 
not work. The communities need clear decisions. For me 
personally as federal chancellor, this is not the most pressing 
question. Yet the institutions, the insurers, and local 
communities need clear regulations. I am ready for a compromise 
in which we say: let us now vote on the two days and add a [word 
indistinct] clause, which would clarify things in two or three 
years -- this clause would never be used; and everybody in the 
SPD knows that also; after all, everybody in the SPD knows that 
it would not work in any other way. What is at stake now is the 
election, not nursing-care insurance. If it were nursing-care 
insurance, and we were to have a free vote, there can be no 
doubt that there would be a huge majority for this model in the 
Bundestag. It is impossible to tell anyone that a country where 
everybody has eight weeks of leave a year -- including public 
holidays -- is not able not to pay wages for two days of holiday 
-- because the two holidays would remain -- or that people 
should not be able to give up two days of vacation. 
  [Bresser] Let us talk about social policies. An 
increasing number of people are no longer covered by 
unemployment insurance but have to resort to social welfare. It 
is the poorest of the poor that the austerity measures of your 
government mainly affect. Is one of the reasons you are 
pursuing those the fact that you sometimes think that these 
people will not vote for you anyway? 
  [Kohl] No, not at all. You are not talking about reality. 
Your statement that we are reducing expenditure for the poorest 
of the poor is simply propaganda. We are saving in all areas. 
We just talked about security. We will have to save over DM1 
billion with the Bundeswehr, which is particularly hard for me. 
This really affects the basic issues of security and freedom in 
our country. 
  [Bresser] But unemployment benefits are being reduced. 
  [Kohl] I will talk about this in a minute. Let me first 
give you another example. Another measure that was extremely 
difficult for me was the reduction in funding for transportation 
for this year. Thus, if you think logically, investments are the 
most important thing. We just mentioned jobs. The more 
investments the state carries out, and the less we concentrate 
on consumption, the better our position is in the fight against 
unemployment. We must indeed save in all other areas as well. 
This also applies to unemployment benefits. One cannot deny 
that it must be ensured that the relationship between social 
benefits and low incomes is sensible. A public debate is going 
on in this respect. 
  [Siegloch] Let us turn to another topic. People are 
complaining about rising rents, rising prices, tax increases, 
and rising social contributions. Exactly at this point, you are 
calling for a pay freeze in the public sector. 
  [Kohl] Well, this is a sweeping statement that is not true. 
I would like to stress that. You should not forget that you are 
talking with the chancellor. If local fees are increased, one 
must check carefully. 
  [Siegloch] I did not blame you for that. 
  [Kohl] Let me just point this out once more. Whether local 
fees should be increased to such an extent and whether it is 
wise to include other things. 
  [Siegloch] But the citizens can only spend their money once. 
  [Kohl] Let us discuss the public sector. 
  [Siegloch] Let me ask you the following question in this 
respect: If an ordinary clerk with two children who has a net 
salary of DM2,800.... 
  [Kohl] You do not know what you are talking about. You are 
taking something for granted that has not yet been decided. 
First of all, let me comment on the wage negotiations. 
Concerning the public sector -- that is the government, which 
covers slightly less than one third, the laender, and the 
communes -- thus, I am also an employer and the right person to 
talk to -- one must take into consideration the overall economic 
situation. One must be aware that the situation in the 
metal-working industry is extremely difficult. One must also 
see what has largely been neglected in the past -- that a job in 
the public sector is secure. We just discussed unemployment. 
This means specifically that good and secure jobs in this area 
must be valued highly. 
  Moreover, everybody is familiar with the budget situation. 
For me this means that ideas about wage increases that were 
expressed years ago -- we did not consider the extent of 
increases right at the time -- cannot be repeated. Thus, we are 
proposing a pay freeze. But whether we talk about a pay freeze 
or about whatever results will be achieved -- I do not want to 
comment on the extent of pay rises because I do not want to 
interfere in the negotiations -- one thing is clear: One cannot 
treat all incomes in the same way. That means that for the low 
incomes settlements must be found that are different from those 
for higher incomes. 
  [Bresser] Are you suggesting some kind of minimum wage? 
  [Kohl] We will have to investigate that. It is a technical 
question. Yet I do not advocate equal pay raises for all. Let 
me mention the popular example of the postman. The same applies 
to the professional soldier, the fire fighter, and others. I 
believe that one must differentiate here. 
  [Bresser] All sectors of the population are affected by the 
cutbacks in an election year. There are still seven or eight 
months to go until the Bundestag election. 
  [Kohl] I would appreciate the same approach among other 
groups. The government has just proposed a pay freeze. I would 
like to mention this, too, because the media usually ignore that. 
  [Bresser] The voter, Chancellor, gets the impression that 
this government is no longer up to it. Even on economic issues 
the opposition is meanwhile thought to be more competent. Is 
this not an alarm signal for you? 
  [Kohl] Of course it is an alarm signal. But you are talking 
about election results that are not yet taking place. For me it 
is absolutely clear that this coalition will win the Bundestag 
elections in October. I do not have the least doubt about that. 
You know, these premature burials, I have been living with them 
for two decades. As party chairman I have been buried all the 
time, and I am still here -- quite lively, too. As candidate in 
elections -- in 1976 they hardly gave me a chance at all. As a 
candidate from Mainz, they said he comes from the country. 
Well, then I was on the verge of winning an absolute majority, 
which people might or might not remember. In 1982-83 I 
initiated early Bundestag elections. Everybody, well not 
everybody but most people, said I was crazy. 
  [Bresser] This is the past. Let us talk about the future. 
  [Kohl] No, no, we want to talk about past predictions. We 
should talk about them. People said, he cannot win with the 
stationing Pershings, the medium-range missiles. We won the 
elections. In 1987 -- just look at the opinion polls before the 
1987 Bundestag elections. Back then, I was just one of the 
candidates. And in 1990, four years ago -- I can still see you 
on television back then -- four years ago we had the first free 
elections in the People's Chamber. In February they said, well 
this Christian Democratic Union [CDU],... this is traditional 
Social Democratic Party [SPD] country: Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, 
etc. The CDU does not stand a chance. And we won the elections. 
Why should I discuss election results with you now? I am 
convinced that we will win the elections. 
  [Siegloch] You quoted a whole number of figures and old 
predictions. One of them was made eight months before the last 
Bundestag elections, when 59 percent said they believed that the 
coalition would win. Now it is 17 percent, and 48 percent say 
Rudolf Scharping will win the elections. Does this not bother 
you a bit? 
  [Kohl] Of course, but I am not troubled, I want to fight, I 
am determined. Of course, I know that the situation today is 
far more difficult than in 1990. There is much more turmoil all 
over Europe. We are facing problems like unemployment, there 
are people's fears, there is the situation in the new laender. 
Taking all this into account, things are difficult. But I can 
point out that we have achieved something. 
  [Bresser] That is right, we do not doubt your achievements 
over the past years. We know that you have been chancellor for 
quite some time now. But a desire for change can be felt in 
this society. 
  [Kohl] How do you know? 
  [Bresser] People also got tired of Adenauer and Schmidt. 
Do you not think there will be a time when people want to see 
new faces? 
  [Kohl] You are certainly right in that. But the question is 
when this will be. 
  [Bresser] When do you think it will be? 
  [Kohl] You may hope that it will be in October. I am 
certain it is not going to be in October. You know, these are 
questions I will not answer now. For me there have, of course, 
been certain considerations after 10 years in office. And these 
have not been ordinary times. The question was whether I run 
again or not. And I did not decide to run again for reasons of 
prestige. I made that decision because I am convinced that I 
stand a better chance than others -- if I make use of it -- of 
taking political unification in Europe and unification in 
Germany a big step forward. Adenauer said: German unity, 
European unity, two sides of the same coin. And because I am 
deeply convinced that if we only concentrate on German issues 
and isolate ourselves within Europe, evil spirits will turn up 
in some form. And at the beginning of this 21st century -- not 
that I want to stay until the 21st century -- during these 
years, where important breakthroughs have to be made in Europe, 
I want to take part and want to help. And I can help. I can 
say that more than anybody else, because there was no chancellor 
before me that had equally friendly, close relations with 
Washington, Moscow, London, and Paris. And I want to contribute 
this. 
  [Siegloch] And you have never, not even once, regretted 
this decision? 
  [Kohl] No. You know, this is a question I ask myself -- if 
I should have become federal chancellor at all. When I was in 
Mainz there was general mourning when I departed. I left Mainz 
and people were sorry that I left. This is a moment you have to 
wait for, when people are sorry that you leave, and not when 
people overwhelm you with praise insinuating that you should go. 
You have to sense that yourself. At that time, people would 
ask me: Are you mad? Giving up that relatively easy job in 
Mainz to become leader of the opposition in Bonn. Nobody had 
ever done that before. Let us see how others will do. Then I 
have not only experienced good years here but also bitter ones. 
  [Bresser] I think we should now be talking of the future, 
and here the issue is the landtag election in Lower Saxony, the 
European election, the election in Saxony Anhalt. 
  [Kohl] Nineteen elections altogether. 
  [Bresser] It is quite safe to say that the CDU does not 
stand much of a chance in any of the three elections. When 
must the trend, which is running against you, reverse so that 
you stand a chance in the Bundestag election? 
  [Kohl] Excuse me, but how do you know that the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Social Union] does not have good chances in the 
European election? You are simply claiming that. But you did 
the same in the last European election four years ago, or five 
years ago. 
  [Bresser] When you finished ahead of the SPD by only a very 
narrow margin. 
  [Siegloch] And lost 8 percent. 
  [Kohl] Excuse me, but in the last European election many 
people here said that if the CDU/CSU did badly, the party 
leadership would come together and the Kohl era would be over. 
After the election, I asked the CDU leadership: Would anybody 
like to say something? And I looked around and waited. Nobody 
wanted to say anything. 
  [Bresser] Your optimism is... 
  [Kohl] This has nothing to do with optimism. You cannot be 
German chancellor for almost 12 years and chairman of the CDU 
for 21 years on the basis of cheap optimism. I am a realist, 
and I know what the situation is like, and I can assess 
situations. 
  [Bresser] So I ask you, as a realist, by when will the mood 
have to change, to reverse, so that you can come first in the 
Bundestag election? 
  [Kohl] Let me tell you something: I want to win the 
election. I am not talking of moods, and on what day a certain 
mood will change, because it is hard to measure this mood. I am 
certainly not impressed by the polls. The differences in the 
results from the various institutes have meanwhile become so 
bizarre that I do not want to comment any further on it. 
  [Siegloch] Let us now turn to the European election, for 
which you are quite optimistic. Does that mean that Mr. Kohl, 
the European, will go into this election campaign as the head of 
the CDU. Will you campaign in the election ex officio, so to 
speak? 
  [Kohl] Not at the head, because that would mean that I am 
running in the election, and I am not running in the election to 
the European Parliament. No, I have never thought much of 
running in an election when everybody knows that it is only pro 
forma. I will fight in the European election -- just as in all 
other elections, be it the Bundestag or a Landtag election -- 
for every single vote. At the moment we are still discussing 
the details of our election campaign. Still, everybody knows 
who is the chairman of the CDU, and everybody knows who is 
federal chancellor. The CDU and CSU are classic European 
parties, which is why I do not have to demonstrate that I am 
also in favor of Europe. This is something that absolutely 
everybody knows. Even people asked in surveys will never 
challenge my European credentials. 
  [Bresser] So we will see who will appear on the election 
posters for the European election. The first poster was put up 
today. Its slogan is: Politics without a beard. 
  [Kohl] But that is not an election poster. 
  [Siegloch] So what is it? 
  [Kohl] It is an ordinary poster and not an election campaign 
poster. 
  [Bresser] But it was put up today. 
  [Siegloch] And it was put up in front of the Adenauer House. 
  [Kohl] [passage indistinct] and it is a nice picture. 
  [Bresser] So this is the way you are trying to fight against 
Rudolf Scharping. 
  [Kohl] In what way? 
  [Bresser] After all, it is an allusion to Rudolf Scharping. 
  [Kohl] Come on, what counts is the head and not the beard. 
  [Bresser] Rudolf Scharping has often been compared with the 
early Helmut Kohl. Where is the difference between you and 
Rudolf Scharping, apart from the beard? 
  [Kohl] I have to tell you that I have absolutely no 
intention of responding to journalistic games that treat 
politics as entertainment. Rudolf Scharping is the chairman of 
the SPD. 
  [Bresser] True. 
  [Kohl] He is the leading candidate of the SPD -- also true, 
even though he has not been formally nominated. The SPD is a 
major party with a great tradition, and it is the SPD's business 
to determine its candidate and chairman. Why should I comment 
on it? It has nothing to do with me. He is the candidate and 
that is a fact. I did not comment before on whether I preferred 
this person or that one. That is a bit like the weather. The 
SPD chooses its candidate, and we choose ours. 
  [Siegloch] All right, Mr. Chancellor, you do not want to 
comment on the person, but maybe on the issues. One strategy is 
interesting, namely that the SPD has taken up CDU policies on 
many issues -- the asylum issue, internal security, many issues. 
Is not dangerous for you when the differences between the two 
parties are narrowing? 
  [Kohl] No, not at all. The election campaign offers many 
opportunities for the SPD to make it clear what they stand for. 
So far, the Social Democrats have not said anything yet in 
connection with their position in foreign and security policy. 
At the end of his era, Willy Brandt once said ironically: The 
SPD against the rest of the world. The SPD is leading this 
country into total international isolation. Not a single 
reputable member of the Socialist International in Germany 
understands the SPD's foreign policy. Besides, most SPD experts 
in foreign policy also fail to understand their party in this 
connection. The chairman of the SPD Bundestag group, Mr. Klose, 
is much closer to my position on some issues -- for example 
constitutional amendments -- than to that of his own party. The 
problem is that the party congress adopted the wrong policies, 
and now they are stuck with them. 
  Let us now talk of domestic policy issues, economic issues. 
The SPD must explain to the German voters, such as the miners 
in the Ruhr area or the Saarland, how German coal can have a 
future without an energy mix. An energy mix means: coal, gas, 
alternative energy, and nuclear power. The civilian use of 
nuclear energy is, of course, inevitable. Yet, they refuse to 
understand that. How do they intend to build a modern 
industrial society without inexpensive energy? Even within the 
SPD it is agreed that we need that. Even a man like Mr. 
Schroeder, who certainly does not lean toward the right of his 
party, set out to promote an energy concept but gave up on the 
way. 
  [Siegloch] There is a list of other things, too, including 
the great bugging campaign. The SPD now supports wiretapping, 
but your coalition partner [the Free Democratic Party] is 
against it. 
  [Kohl] Well, if we are talking about legal policies, I would 
like to stress the following. I would have adopted the asylum 
law two years ago. It took the SPD two years to agree to a 
sensible solution under pressure from localities and the local 
SPD chairmen, Landtag members, and mayors. You mention 
wiretapping. One has to examine the proposal very carefully 
with a view to the Basic Law. The proposal is not designed to 
permit the wiretapping of private residences. First, it is 
aimed at causing quarrels with the coalition. This is quite 
legitimate, and I have nothing against this strategy. [sentence 
as heard] Second, other issues have to be settled, too, in 
connection with the wiretapping bill and the whole package, 
including access to accounts to prevent money laundering, which 
we are not ready to allow. I do not share these ideas about 
property. 
  [Bresser] What effect do you expect from your strategy to 
blame the SPD in 1994, at the beginning of the election 
campaign, for its policy vis-a-vis the German Democratic 
Republic [GDR] pursued in the 1980s? The voters are concerned 
about Germany's future. Yet you are focusing on the past. Or 
do you believe that you can win votes in east Germany with this 
strategy? 
  [Kohl] I do not understand your question. I do not blame 
the SPD for things that happened in the past and which are no 
longer topical. What is happening? The Social Democrats have 
opened this debate. When the first candidate for the office of 
the federal president was presented, the SPD denounced an honest 
man in an incredible manner. Just remember the statements by 
SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping at the party congress. 
  [Bresser] There was also criticism from your own party. 
  [Kohl] That is a completely different matter. Every 
candidate faces criticism. Let us analyze the situation. The 
SPD also presented a candidate for the president's office. This 
candidate claims that he wants to be the president of all 
Germans. Thus, he must be ready to face questions from the CDU 
and me and every citizen in this country as to where he was when 
the interests of people in Germany were at stake. I do not need 
to investigate the Stasi files in this respect. That is 
nonsense. I am not talking about Stasi files. I would like to 
point out the following: In view of the Wall, all the laender, 
including those governed by Social Democrats, agreed to set up 
the office in Salzgitter for the documentation of crimes against 
humanity against German citizens in the former GDR. In 1984, the 
SPD Bundestag group decided to abolish this documentation center 
at Mr. Honecker's request. Thus, I claim that the SPD candidate 
for the president's office cannot speak for all Germans if he 
unnecessarily withdrew support for this documentation center 
against crime in 1987. He did not want to spend any money on 
this office at a time when he knew -- as I did -- that there 
were still 2,000 political prisoners in the GDR, and that 
Honecker wanted at all costs to remove this documentation 
center. The candidate must be able to give an answer. This is 
not a question that merely affects the past. The man is now 
running for office. If I think of the questions that our 
candidate was asked, the minister president of North 
Rhine-Westphalia must at least answer this question. 
  [Bresser] Mr. Kohl, let me ask you a short question. The 
longer the division [of Germany] lasted, the more your party and 
your government tried to develop better ties and humanitarian 
relief. 
  [Kohl] That is a completely different issue. 
  [Bresser] In this connection, quite a few things were 
questioned that were considered significant earlier, including 
citizenship and Salzgitter. 
  [Kohl] Let me make the following clear: What I just stated 
has nothing to do with state security. Let me repeat that. The 
SPD candidate abandoned -- one can also say betrayed -- an 
important principle of human coexistence at a certain point with 
the support of his party. We have protested against inhumanity 
in South Africa, in Chile, and other parts of the world. There 
were over 2,000 political prisoners in the GDR, and the SPD 
wanted to do Honecker this favor. Others prevented the 
abolition of the office in Salzgitter. What else was discussed 
is another thing. I did not initiate this discussion. You 
mentioned the topic. I never abandoned single German 
citizenship. During my era, there was never the slightest 
chance for the government to do so. Honecker was quite aware of 
that. But the Social Democrats -- leading Social Democrats -- 
assured Honecker in 1987 and before and after that date that 
they would abandon single German citizenship if they should come 
to power, and that the 17 million should receive dual German 
citizenship and would thus be citizens of a different country. 
What would this have meant in the summer of 1989 when the 
Hungarian government did not comply with Honecker's wishes and 
opened the borders with Austria, citing one single German 
citizenship? 
  [Bresser] My original question on that issue was whether an 
election campaign involving national unreliability, as 
presidential candidate Hamm-Bruecher called it, is something 
that might convince voters? 
  [Kohl] Excuse me, it is not a matter of convincing voters, 
it is a matter of the SPD nominating a presidential candidate 
who claims to be a suitable presidential candidate for all of 
Germany, and who must now accept that, in an important decision 
over the past 10 years, he did not decide in favor of his fellow 
countrymen but in accordance with Mr. Honecker's wishes. I have 
to take blame from morning till night. And this is part of my 
job. 
  [Bresser] Honecker had a number of wishes. Among other 
things he wanted billions of marks in loans, which he got from 
you. 
  [Kohl] That is something completely different. The loan did 
get us where we wanted to go. This was the result of an astute 
policy. With the major loan we did not give anything up for 
Honecker, but we bought something. We gave Mr. Honecker a loan 
-- which did not cost the government anything by the way -- and 
then we made him let people leave the country, the former GDR, 
in increasing numbers. And anybody who knows about the real 
psychological change in the GDR will know that the moment when 
millions of our fellow- citizens were here in the West, the 
propaganda machinery of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany 
[SED] collapsed. 
  [Siegloch] But let us now take a look into the future after 
talking about the past for so long. There are three days to go 
before the CDU party conference, and your party does not seem 
very united. 
  [Kohl] How do you know? 
  [Siegloch] Well, let us think of some controversial 
comments: Biedenkopf says pensions are not safeguarded, other 
party members say we will have to pay for our own glasses in the 
future, for dentures. Others are trying to persecute smokers. 
  [Kohl] Let me tell you something.... 
  [Siegloch] Should the party chairman not put an end to this? 
  [Kohl] I do not have any doubts that an end will be put to 
all this after the party conference. You know just as well as I 
do -- you can see this from the time when the SPD was in 
government, if you are talking about health care reform -- that 
a party that is in government, that has to make proposals, 
interpret proposals, is a choir with many voices; that there are 
people in our party -- I do not want to mention names here, 
there is a whole number, and this is part of a democratic party, 
an open party -- who consider it a matter of their prestige to 
turn to the public. And it is a fact -- you are more familiar 
with the media than I am, I think, because it is your job -- 
that you will only appear on the ZDF [German TV Two] news if 
you say something against the party line. Saying the government 
is doing a good job will not get you into the news. So, there 
are a certain number.... This happens in every party, it is not 
an issue for the CDU alone. Just read documents of the time of 
the SPD government, and you will see the number of disputes. I 
am not pleased about this, and I am not defending it. I find it 
absolutely unacceptable in some cases. I will express this very 
clearly on Monday. You can follow that and you can broadcast 
it. This is one thing, but the other thing is that this party, 
the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] will go into the election 
campaign as a single body. 
  [Bresser] Do you not sometimes get the impression that the 
CDU/CSU is somewhat lacking in enthusiasm at the moment, not 
motivated enough for such a difficult election? 
  [Kohl] Why are you talking about the CDU? Is there anybody 
that is not unenthusiastic? I talk from morning to night. 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Bresser] You probably exclude yourself. 
  [Kohl] Yes of course. And I know many others. No, this 
is part of the so-called image, something that is fashionable. 
I keep hearing people talk about weariness, disenchantment with 
political parties. It is a general weariness. There are people 
leaving political parties. Trade unions are losing many more 
members than for instance the CDU. Employers keep quiet and do 
not talk about the wave of people leaving. There is talk about 
the churches, the figures have been published. Take sports. Do 
you know of any field where we do not breed weariness. And I do 
not have to tell you -- just watch television in the evening, on 
all channels, and you will go to bed weary. There are hardly 
any programs that make you go to bed in a cheerful mood. 
  [Siegloch] But you are confident. You have been party 
chairman for 20 years, and chancellor for 12 years. Would you 
say that the 16 October election is the most difficult one of 
your life? 
  [Kohl] No, I would not say that at all. You know, these are 
just common sayings. On the one hand they say -- and this is a 
phrase coined by Adenauer --election campaigns are fountains of 
youth. These are just words. What are the facts? Well, I sit 
in my office, attend election events. I go there, usually quite 
fed up. I could imagine something more pleasant than talking 
for five hours between lunchtime and evening. And all the 
hassle.... But when I stand in front of the audience, when I 
enter the assembly halls, when I talk to the people, when I see 
them in front of me -- let me put it somewhat infomally -- then 
you feel like an old army horse: You hear marching music, you 
raise your head and you march. There is duty, and then there is 
inclination. You know, I am not somebody who got into politics 
via the backdoor. I have always been politically active. I 
organized my first campaign rally in 1949, at age 19. And this 
party is not just any organization for me, it is part of my 
home. There are personal, human relationships, both in the ups 
and downs. This is how a proper party works. This is the same 
in every party, not just in ours. And one has a moral 
obligation toward one's political friends. I am standing on 
their shoulders. I could not survive in this office if I did 
not have the confidence of the great majority, and confidence is 
a matter of giving as well. 
  [Bresser] You also need another shoulder. You want to 
continue the coalition with the FDP. The question is, whether 
they want it as well. By when do you expect a clear statement 
by the FDP? 
  [Kohl] They will do it in time. I know that journalists 
have to conduct such discussions because they have to write 
something. But you know very well that the FDP will not do it 
now. I can understand that. The FDP will do it during its 
party conference. 
  [Bresser] As early as in June? 
  [Kohl] The FDP will have a party conference and every FDP 
member will be asked when a statement will be issued. Well, 
then they'll go into the summer recess. And if they do not 
issue the statement before the summer recess, they will be faced 
with the question all summer. So, the FDP will be sensible 
enough -- it is not up to me to give advice to the FDP -- to 
make its decision at an appropriate time. And it will take a 
decision that is logical. The FDP cannot go into the election 
campaign saying: We have done an excellent job for four years, 
but now we will leave. Neither can The FDP say we will not 
commit ourselves at all. Then the SPD might want to form a 
coalition with the CDU, and the CDU could work with the SPD. I 
am not at all afraid. They will also be in parliament. This is 
another death knell that is being rung all the time: will they 
get in, will they get beyond the 5 percent? Franz Josef Strauss 
always used to talk about this. I used to say: `Stop it. Every 
time you say the FDP is in a bad position, they will not get 
into parliament, people will say in the end -- but we want the 
FDP in.' This was an old trick that Hans- Dietrich Genscher was 
perfect at. He always put on a worried face; the others said 
the FDP would not get in, and then he achieved good results. 
  [Siegloch] Chancellor, we journalists love speculating. It 
could be that the FDP will not be enough. This means that a 
grand coalition could become necessary. Helmut Kohl, 
chancellor of a grand coalition -- would you say that is out of 
the question for you? 
  [Kohl] I do not want to say anything about this. I do not 
want a grand coalition. Not because I am against grand 
coalitions in general. Let me say again, a grand coalition can 
be unavoidable in certain situations. In Baden-Wuerttemberg my 
friends have formed a grand coalition, and I supported them. 
But I do not think that a grand coalition would solve the 
problems any better. What must be done now -- investment in the 
future, a real change in the country -- cannot be achieved in a 
grand coalition. 
  [Siegloch] Mr. Kohl, the question was whether you would be 
chancellor of such a grand coalition? 
  [Kohl] I do not know. Why should I say no definitely? I 
have a certain responsibility for my own party. 
  [Siegloch] Does this mean, if there is no other way? 
  [Kohl] No, this is something you are inserting into the 
debate. This is not my opinion. I will decide, it is my choice. 
I am a free citizen in a free country. Nobody forced me to 
become chancellor, and nobody will be able to force me to make a 
decision [contrary to what] I think right at the time. But I am 
now taking with you. I am not expecting it will come to that. 
  [Bresser] What will happen if the CDU/CSU does not become 
the strongest party in the 16 October Bundestag election? In 
this election year you will be 64. Have you, the chancellor of 
unity, ever thought that you might have missed the right moment 
to resign? 
  [Kohl] No, I have never thought that I might have missed the 
right moment. I would have chosen the right moment. Had I not 
been convinced that what I have done is right, I would not have 
done it. After all, nobody forced me to do anything. I could 
have easily have said at one point: Well, I am now on a pedestal 
and expect everybody to worship me. In Germany those who 
resigned have always been the greatest. If the Lord were to 
give me that, I would have great expectations. [Sentence as 
heard] But this has never been my intention. My intention is 
-- for the reasons that I have mentioned -- to bring things a 
bit further ahead in a critical situation of the world, in which 
things are changing rapidly, and to make my contribution as a 
German, who, together with our people has been able to enjoy the 
support for unification by others. 
  [Bresser] If the voters want that contribution.. 
  [Kohl] Yes, if the voters want it. This is why I am 
fighting for each individual vote. When you broadcast the 
result of surveys and predict on television that my end is near, 
I look at you with amusement and say: Let us wait until 
election night. 
  [Siegloch] And then we will know more. 
  [Bresser] What if the voters do not want it? Then you would 
no longer be chancellor. 
  [Kohl] The voter is the supreme sovereign of the country. 
This is the difference from you television people, for example. 
You do not have a supreme sovereign. I have to pay my fees 
whether I agree with you or not. You can vote me out, but I 
cannot vote you out. That is a big difference. 
  [Bresser, Siegloch] Thank you very much, chancellor.

  [Text] Bonn/Moscow (DDP/ADN)--The German Government is 
still counting on Russia's participation in NATO's ultimatum 
against the Serbs. Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
announced today that he wanted to convince his Russian 
counterpart Andrey Kozyrev of NATO's position in their talks in 
Athens. Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed that everything had to 
be done to "include" Russia. 
  Before flying to Athens for a meeting with his counterparts 
from Greece, Belgium, and Germany, Kozyrev gave an assurance 
that Russia would not allow anyone to divert it from the path of 
strategic partnership with the United States and the other 
Western countries because of the Bosnian crisis. Air strikes by 
NATO in Bosnia could, however, bring about the collapse of the 
peace process, Kozyrev warned. 
  Kohl told the daily paper DIE WELT that he was glad there 
was 
now a joint decision by NATO and that U.S. President Bill 
Clinton had assumed "some kind of leadership role." There was 
now "another chance for an end to this terrible war in the 
Balkans and, above all, the horrific suffering of the 
population." Although the Bundeswehr cannot make available any 
troops of its own in the former Yugoslavia for historic reasons, 
he wanted to give logistical support outside that territory if 
it was necessary and Bonn was asked for it. 
  Speaking on the private television station VOX, Kinkel said 
the deployment of German soldiers on AWACS aircraft is not 
affected by possible NATO air strikes against Serb positions in 
Bosnia. The stationing of Bundeswehr soldiers on NATO ship 
convoys in the Adriatic is also covered by the Constitution. 
  The former Bundeswehr General Elmar Schmaehling had earlier 
warned in a DDP/ADN interview that the participation of German 
soldiers in AWACS reconnaissance flights in the event of a NATO 
air strike against Serb positions in Bosnia would violate the 
Constitution. The German Government would, after all, be taking 
part in "military attacks" outside NATO territory. This would 
be in contravention of Article 87a of the Basic Law, according 
to which German forces can only be deployed for defense purposes.

<F P=106> [Report signed "fy": "Where Are the 81,000 Tonnes of </F>
Ammunition? Questions About the Russian Troop Withdrawal"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 15 February -- Irregularities, which might 
lead to serious difficulties between the German and Russian 
sides, have come to light in the Russian troop withdrawal from 
eastern Germany. The Russian Army leadership is currently 
unwilling or not in a position to provide key information about 
the whereabouts of 81,000 tonnes of ammunition -- an amount that 
would fill 4,000 railroad wagons -- which, according to 
information that they gave when they began the withdrawal, 
should still be in Germany. The German side fears that the 
Russian military might have buried the ammunition at the sites 
that they have used until now. In 1993, the Russian forces 
leadership requested permission to destroy, that is, blow up 
75,000 tonnes of ammunition at their training sites. The 
permission was denied. The German authorities believe that the 
stocks may be defective, which would make their transportation 
particularly dangerous, or consist of outdated ammunition, for 
which the Russian military no longer possesses appropriate 
weapons systems. The Bundeswehr does not have an overview of 
the situation, because they have no possibility of inspecting 
Russian military facilities and the Russian leadership does not 
reply to queries. Thus, the Bundeswehr has to compare the 
materiel that has been transported with the information on 
stocks that they were given when the withdrawal began. 
  In 1991, that is, before the withdrawal started, the 
leadership of the Western Group of Forces stated that their 
stocks of ammunition amounted to 677,000 tonnes. That was less 
than the German side had assumed. In accordance with 
German-Russian agreements 317,500 tonnes were removed from 
Germany in 1991 and 193,910 tonnes were removed in 1992. This 
means that 165,590 tonnes of ammunition still had to be in 
Germany at the beginning of 1993. The withdrawal plan envisaged 
that 125,000 tonnes would be removed in 1993 and that the other 
40,590 tonnes would be transported to Russia in 1994 along with 
the remaining military units. In 1993, however, the actual 
quantity of ammunition removed was well below the projected 
amount. Although the first deputy commander in chief of the 
Western Group of Forces stated in writing in the summer of last 
year that the backlog would be eliminated by the end of the 
year, only 68,990 tonnes were transported instead of the 125,000 
tonnes that have been agreed. 
  On 28 September of last year, the Russian military 
leadership 
suddenly issued new information. The commander in chief of the 
Western Group of Forces, General Burlakov, wrote to the German 
liaison staff stating that his forces had used up 32,875 tonnes 
of ammunition in 1991 and 23,980 tonnes in 1992, that is, 56,855 
tonnes altogether. 
  The German liaison staff doubts the veracity of these 
figures, because training on Russian firing ranges has been 
"stopped as much as possible." In addition, 11,331 military 
trucks would have been needed to transport that quantity of 
ammunition. They would have had to have moved the ammunition 
from the Russian forces main depots in Biesenthal near Berlin 
and Wulkow near Magdeburg to the Russian firing ranges, and that 
did not happen. In his letter, Burlakov does not state how much 
ammunition would be used this year. Burlakov stated that the 
remaining stocks of ammunition that would be removed in 1994 
only amount to 5,560 tonnes. 
  In its annual assessment for 1993, the Western Group of 
Forces provided yet another set of figures. It is now asserted 
that 24,185 tonnes of ammunition were used in addition to the 
68,990 tonnes of ammunitions that were removed last year. The 
quantity that is to be transported back to Russia in 1994 has 
now risen by 10,000 tonnes to 15,560 tonnes. Despite these 
evident contradictions, the commander in chief of the Western 
Group of Forces firmly rejected German requests for an 
explanation. Burlakov seemed particularly annoyed about the 
fact that doubts were being expressed about the reliability of 
his figures and he demanded that his figures be simply accepted 
without explanation. The German side is concerned that the 
facilities the Russians still have in which ammunition can be 
suitably stored are insufficient for the storage of the 80,000 
tonnes, the whereabouts of which are still unaccounted for. The 
storage capacity that the Russians currently have amounts to 
60,000 tonnes. 
  Until now, the Russian side has adhered to all the 
provisions 
of withdrawal agreements. According to Russian figures, on 1 
February, only 29,908 out of an original 338,800 troops were 
still in Germany and 33,506 out of an original 207,400 
civilians: 248 out of a total of 4,288 combat tanks were still 
in Germany, as well as 1,228 out of 8,208 armored personnel 
carriers, and 185 out of 3,664 artillery pieces.

<F P=106> [First of three installments on interview with Abdullah </F>
Ocalan, leader of the Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK, by 
Huseyin Gul; place and date not given] 
  [Text] KURD-A/Botan-- [Gul] The clashes never stopped this 
winter. The state forces are launching daily air and ground 
operations. What is your assessment of this situation? 
  [Ocalan] The state is not remaining idle. It is launching 
attacks with all its might and is exerting every effort to gain 
victory for its policy, government, and parties. We are working 
to draw some conclusions after carefully assessing the air and 
ground operations it launched under such difficult winter 
conditions. This assessment of the situation is opening the way 
to numerous political developments. It is helping us to 
understand our real strength, see our advantages as well as 
shortcomings, and clarify and evaluate the path of our progress. 
  Tansu Ciller is describing all such operations as "political 
decisiveness." What she means is that she is trying to achieve 
results by manipulating the laws where our nation is concerned 
and by using the counterguerrilla organization in a lawless 
manner. She is showing that she is decisive on this issue. 
  [Gul] I want to ask a question that interests everybody. 
What is your assessment of the murder of Mehmet Nabi Inciler 
and Behcet Canturk, who were Kurds known as godfathers in Turkey? 
  [Ocalan] We could easily state that starting with the murder 
of DEP [Democracy Party] parliamentarian Mehmet Sincar, these 
murders of those we could describe as patriotic Kurdish 
businessmen were done under the direct orders from the highest 
authority. Nabi Inciler, nicknamed "Inci Baba," and Behcet 
Canturk were disposed off because of the role they could have 
played in the Kurdish problem, as they had done in the past. 
  These are intimidation murders aimed at silencing this 
[patriotic] segment and at encouraging the emergence of a 
collaborationist segment, such as volunteer village guards, some 
clan leaders drawn to Ankara, and many such agents. 
  [Gul] The 27 March local elections are approaching. It is 
expected that the state will conduct large-scale detentions on 
the eve of the elections. What will be your stance on the 
elections? 
  [Ocalan] The state is engaged in an "all or nothing" game. 
It is trying to hold the elections on the principle of the 
complete destruction of our movement. It is trying to 
completely disregard the legal foundations. It is trying to 
reverse a possible referendum situation in Kurdistan. It 
appears that the state will intensify its activities in this 
direction. 
  [Gul] What is your assessment of the attack on Zhalah camp 
and the position of the southern forces [Iraqi Kurdish parties] 
on this attack? 
  [Ocalan] The Zhalah operation was designed to use the 
federal 
government in the south against us or, failing this, to warn 
that government that Turkey could bomb it out. With the Zhalah 
operation, the Turkish state is also indicating its "political 
decisiveness" to resort to bombings if its policy toward the PKK 
fails. They are resorting to military, political, and 
diplomatic initiatives. They already did all that was possible 
in the diplomatic arena. All these initiatives are various 
aspects of their policy, and indications are that they will 
further escalate their violence by the spring. 
  The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that we must 
look at the situation from a wider perspective, assign duties, 
and prepare our guerrilla force, war effort, introduction of new 
ideas, enhancement of efforts, and cognizance of defects and 
assessment of advantages accordingly. 
  It is imperative that we make preparations quickly and move 
toward implementation. Time is vital for us, too. It is 
possible to pack the efforts of the past years into these few 
months. It is possible to achieve as much within the coming 
months as was achieved during the previous years. At such 
fast-moving historic times, it is easy to make maximum gains in 
a lifetime if a proper response is made.

<F P=106> [Article by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara -- Turkey will enter into an important 
phase in March. The important period that begins with the 
Ramadan Feast of the Muslims, will continue with the Newroz 
Feast of the Kurds and will finally end with the March 27 local 
elections which will effect both the Kurds and the Turks. These 
three important events will take place within one week of each 
other. The widespread belief held by the public is that the 
local elections will not be held in a complete safe environment. 
There are reports already which predict that both the state and 
the outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) will exert 
pressure on each other during the elections. The first example 
of such pressure was experienced in Cizre. Cizre is a district 
that is mostly influenced by the PKK and for this reason the 
state is attaching special importance to this district and 
taking similar measures in other settlements. The most obvious 
element of such measures is that suburbs are being evacuated and 
village guards are being settled there. The communities which 
are forced out of their settlements during these operations are 
also missing out on their opportunity to vote. It is reported 
that about 1.5 million people in south and southeastern Anatolia 
are being forced to migrate. 
  The excitement and the tension of the March 27 local 
elections have already begun. In the western part of the 
country, almost all parties' candidates are being announced and 
election campaigns have started. However, there is nobody in 
south and southeastern Anatolia who has announced his or her 
candidature for the mayoral elections as yet. With the 
exception of one or two, almost every candidate's name is being 
kept secret. Following the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party's 
boycott, the political parties are keeping the names of their 
candidates secret for security reasons. The pro-Kurdish 
Democracy Party (DEP) is also reluctant to announce its 
candidates for fear of reprisals. 
  The other common element among the parties is that they all 
feel that the March elections will not be held in a safe 
environment. The source of this suspicion is the prediction that 
both the government and the PKK will apply pressure on each 
other during the elections. 
  It is necessary to point out though that the communities 
living in this region do not want such pressure or election 
rigging. Both seem impossible to avoid. For one thing, the 
government is afraid that the PKK will support the Democracy 
Party's mayoral candidates and use the election as a referendum 
to bring them onto the international political platform to argue 
for the Kurdish cause. 
  The other worry is that the PKK will argue that the election 
results are invalid because of the pressure the government has 
exerted on the candidates of the Democracy Party and will again 
try to use this as ammunition against Turkey at the 
international level and boycott the election results. Everybody 
in the region is curious about the PKK's attitude toward the 
local elections. The PKK has not expressed any opinions about 
the elections as yet. There are reports that it will make a 
statement on Feb. 15 about the local elections. It is feared 
that if the PKK calls for non-participation in the local 
elections, there will be a reduction in the number of votes in 
the region and the PKK will use this as a referendum to argue 
its case. 
  This has proven to be the least favored option so far. DEP 
leader Hatip Dicle's remark: "We may reach a historic decision 
and not take part in the elections" is one element that adds 
weight to this theory. One other possible outcome is that the 
PKK regards the results of an election which it has boycotted to 
be to its advantage. In short, the PKK will try in any case to 
use the election results as its referendum. Almost everybody 
seems to agree that the results of the local elections will be 
in the PKK's favor. The PKK is aiming to win at least 200 local 
government posts in the Southeast. As the PKK makes these 
calculations, the government is making preparations to ensure 
that the elections take place. 
  As a result of amendments made earlier, members of the 
Armed Forces will be able to vote at the local elections with 
their weapons in their hands. Certain sections of the community 
are critical of this decision, saying the shadow of weapons will 
be on the ballot boxes, but the government authorities say that 
this measure is necessary for security reasons. As a 
precautionary measure, the authorities say, the ballot boxes 
will be taken by helicopter to a safe place for counting. 
Recent newspaper reports say that some 150,000 additional 
soldiers have been sent to the region in preparation for the 
elections. Observers point out what the PKK will do is not 
certain, but suspect that it will attack polling booths at which 
the armed forces will cast their votes in order to ensure that 
the government does not have the chance to change the election 
results. One fact is that the PKK has forbidden all political 
parties from taking part in the elections. All parties except 
the Welfare Party (RP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) 
have obeyed this order. For this reason parties are having 
difficulty in finding and endorsing mayoral candidates in the 
region as the candidates will be the first targets. 
<H5>  Cizre is a Battlefield </H5>
  As the date for the local elections draws closer, the 
fighting in Cizre, a district of Sirnak province, between the 
security forces and the PKK militants intensifies. As armed 
conflicts are taking place almost everyday, the inhabitants of 
the region are being forced to flee. 
  There are reports which claim that up to 2,000 families have 
left the district as a result of pressure from the security 
forces. Some are going back to the villages they came from 
while others are going to Adana, Mardin, Iskenderun and 
Istanbul. Also among the reports is the claim that village 
guards are being settled in the dwellings vacated by the 
villagers. The government wants the chief village guard and RP 
candidate Kamil Atak to be elected as the mayor for Cizre. 
  The other issue is that those villagers who leave their 
villages will be unable to vote because they are not on the 
voting registers of the cities they move to. One other 
interesting thing is that the village guards who move into the 
empty houses will not be able to vote either. It would not be 
an exaggeration to say though that village guards who are not on 
the electoral roll will be made to vote. This would be regarded 
as an act of interference in the election process by the 
authorities. 
  The reason for the security forces labelling Cizre as a 
special zone is that Cizre is one of the districts in which the 
PKK is very effective. The number of people living in the 
surrounding villages, Cizre and the Sirnak province is said to 
be around 100,000 (including the ones who have moved out) even 
though the population in the area has decreased in the past 
one-and-a-half months due to the large numbers of people leaving 
the area. The fact that village guards are assisting the 
security forces in exerting pressure on the villages means that 
there is a contradiction. The village guards can only be active 
in villages in accordance with the laws in place but they are 
now becoming active in towns and cities as can be seen from 
their activities in Cizre. 
  According to reports received from Cizre and its environs, 
the village guards are able to question people following the 
operations they carry out in cooperation with the security 
forces. It is claimed that some of these people who are 
detained have also been killed, at least 15 of them by the 
village guards. Eyewitnesses say that a villager named Ahmet 
Kutle was assassinated by the village guards in the command of 
Kamil Atak in front of the Kerem Hotel. 
<H5>  Events Experienced in Cizre Day by Day </H5>
  In January, security forces put up posters in Cizre which 
read: "Young man, you may have joined an organization or 
committed crimes either voluntarily or by force. Society and 
the state believes that one may make a mistake and also believe 
in the necessity of pardoning those who repent. In order to 
benefit from this opportunity, turn yourself into the nearest 
security office." Another poster read, "Flags depicting the 
hammer and sickle are the symbol of communism. The PKK's real 
flag is the red flag with the hammer and sickle which the PKK is 
hiding from the people. The PKK's main target is to establish a 
communist order." 
  The tension which began with the hanging of these posters 
has 
reached its peak with the operations carried out of Jan. 22 in 
Sur, Dagkapi, Alibey, Dicle and Meydanbasi neighborhoods where 
nearly 500 people were taken into custody. Those who were taken 
into custody were reportedly ordered to stand and hold their 
hands on top of their heads for three hours. Meanwhile, the 
town's telephone connections were cut off as well. 
  During the night after the day when operations were carried 
out in the neighborhoods, PKK militants conducted a raid on the 
quarters of the Security Directorate. It was claimed that four 
policemen were killed in the raid. The Office of the Emergency 
Rule Governor announced that one PKK militant and a policeman 
were killed and four other policemen were wounded in the attack. 
Following the raid, security forces were alleged to have combed 
the town at random and one child was allegedly wounded in the 
operation. 
  The tension continued in the following days. On Jan. 27, 
village guards and security forces staged a march. After police 
had instructed tradesmen in Cizre to hang Turkish flags on their 
shops otherwise they would be asked to pay a TL [Turkish lira] 
500,000 fine, there was a protest march against the PKK. The 
number of marchers rose to 600 with the participation of the 
village guards affiliated to Kamil Atak. It was claimed that 
certain village guards looted some shops during the march. 
  On Jan. 28, the Nur neighborhood was raided by the security 
forces and the village guards. 
  On Jan. 30, the body of Ibrahim Danis (19), who was alleged 
to have been taken into custody during the operation in Kurtulus 
neighborhood on Jan. 27, was found. Danis's body was alleged to 
have been put in a house which belonged to a village guard and 
the house was claimed to have been bombed later. 
  Persons above the age of 10 have started being taken into 
custody. While it is claimed that people who are taken into 
custody are tortured and forced to abandon the town, seven of 
those who were taken in custody were killed and no information 
about 15 others could be obtained. The names of the people who 
are claimed to have been killed after being taken in custody are 
as follows: 
  Ibrahim Danis, Resit Pusal, Selim Ebubekir Duran, Ahmet 
Yusuf 
Tun and his son Isa Tun, and Selim and Ahmet whose last names 
cannot be determined. 
  A total of nine people, two of whom are children, have lost 
their lives since the intensive clashes broke out. 
  People have become accustomed to the clashes which are 
experienced almost every day. The clashes began on Jan. 7 with 
PKK militants throwing hand grenades at a panzer and continued 
until the next morning. Two individuals were wounded in the 
clashes and 35 workplaces were destroyed. The latter included 
buildings of the PTT [Post, Telephone, Telegraph office], Ziraat 
Bank and the bureau of the daily OZGUR GUNDEM. The fact that 
heavy weaponry such as antiaircraft, mortar and machine guns are 
used during the clashes means that serious damage has been 
caused. Naturally, security of life is the main problem. No 
one is safe. The people of Cizre have started to pay the price 
of the support they have given to the PKK. Ties have now been 
cut off completely before the elections. The most apparent 
outcome of this fact is that village guards have a say in all 
parts of the town. 
<H5>  The Village Guard System </H5>
  The village guard system has been set up in accordance with 
Village Law No. 442. Guards are selected according to 
provisions set out in the law. Under this law, guards are 
assigned only in their respective villages. However, in 
practice they are away from their villages for days and weeks at 
a time, and they even participate in cross-border operations. 
As is the case in the Cizre example, they can take people in 
custody and question them. The village guard system exceeded 
its legal base a long time ago and has been operating outside 
the law. Village guards have become people who commit crimes in 
the name of the state with the power they get from the state. 
The main characteristics of the village guards is their being 
selected from among the pro-state Kurdish tribes. In a way it 
may also be termed a paid military service. However it is also 
true that besides those volunteer village guards there are also 
those who are forced to become village guards. It is known that 
those who refuse to become village guards encounter dangers, 
including death. In their respective regions, village guards 
have established a system which resembles autonomous authority. 
For example, Chief Village Guard Alihan Tatar, who lives in a 
fort-like house in Sirnak, has put a Turkish flag on top of his 
house and declared his autonomy. 
  The fact that a concrete development has not yet been 
achieved in the solution of the Kurdish matter, which is one of 
Turkey's major problems, makes the local elections, which are to 
be held on March 27, all the more significant. 
  The most important expectation of the people in the region 
is 
that they will experience fair and democratic elections. 
However this does not seem possible. It is clearly seen that 
both the state and the PKK will exert pressure during the 
elections. 
  As a matter of fact, everything has now started to be 
treated 
almost in humorous terms. Fundamental terms such as legislation 
and law have almost lost their significance. One incident, 
which could become the subject of a joke, occurred in Bitlis. A 
total of 79 civil servants, who work at state offices such as 
the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) and the Village and 
Rural Affairs Authority, have been sent to provinces like Tokat, 
Kayseri and Cankiri on the grounds that they have provided 
assistance to the PKK. The Office of the Chief of General Staff 
reportedly wanted those people to be followed in their new areas 
as well. However there is one point to be made here--and this 
is where the humor lies--the law calls for a prison term ranging 
from two to five years for those who assist an illegal 
organization and requires trial by state security courts.

  [Text] Families of the diplomatic corps serving at the 
Turkish Embassy in Belgrade have left Serbia, two days before 
the NATO ultimatum expires. The group of 27 -- 17 children and 
10 women -- left Belgrade and entered Turkey from the Kapikule 
border post. 
  Other NATO member countries have already evacuated the 
families of their diplomatic corps. NATO countries with 
embassies in Belgrade have reportedly reduced the number of 
their diplomats.

  [Text] Tension persists among Turkey, Russia, and 
Kazakhstan on transporting oil. Ankara was disturbed, because 
it has now become clear that Kazakhstan's oil will be 
transported to the Black Sea through Russia. Now attention has 
been riveted on the status of the Straits. 
  [Begin Fatih Yilmaz recording] Kazakhstan President 
Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's visit to the United States at the beginning of the 
week produced an intriguing result for Turkey. Nazarbayev and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton reached a consensus on transporting 
Kazakhstan's oil to the Black Sea through Russia. This created 
unease in Ankara, which was hoping that Kazakhstan's oil would 
be transported to Ceyhan through Baku. Kazakhstan's pro-Russian 
stance was the primary cause of the unease. The issue of 
transporting oil through the Black Sea was the other cause for 
the unease. This question raises the status of the Straits. 
The U.S. oil companies favor transporting Kazakhstan's oil to 
the Black Sea through the Straits. But now tension persists 
between Turkey and Russia over the issue of the Straits. Turkey 
is not positively inclined toward the use of the Straits for oil 
transportation. Russia is insisting on it. The status of the 
Straits will be taken up during the talks to be held between 
Turkey and Russia next week in Ankara. Ankara is getting ready 
to present an alternate proposal to transport the oil reaching 
the Black Sea and the Mediterranean through the Samsun-Ceyhan 
pipeline. [end recording]

  [Text] The European Commission expressed its regret today 
over the measures the Greek Government has adopted against 
Skopje and sought clarification of this action. 
  According to an AFP dispatch from Brussels, Commission 
President Jacques Delors said these measures are no good either 
for building Europe or for the family spirit that should govern 
the member states of the European Union. 
  The European Commission's press spokesman said the 
Commission 
is awaiting the results of the discussion the European troika 
will hold as well as the explanations the Greek side will give 
before adopting a position concerning the free movement of trade 
between a united Europe and third countries. 
  In Paris, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Greek 
Government's decision does not facilitate the dialogue that 
France desires and one which would provide a solution and 
contribute to the necessary stability in the Balkans. The 
spokesman noted that France intends to convey to Greece its 
concern at a time when everyone's goal should be to ease the 
tension in the Balkans. 
  The German Government has also expressed its concern over 
Greece's measures. The German Foreign Ministry spokesman said 
Bonn considers the Balkan region needs more, not less stability. 
  Denmark criticized Greece's decision to impose economic 
sanctions on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and asked 
Athens to resolve its disputes with Skopje through negotiations. 
Danish Foreign Minister Niel Helveg Petersen asked that the 
issue be raised at the European Union's foreign ministers 
meeting in Brussels on Monday [21 February].

<F P=106> [Article signed SDC/JLV: "Yeltsin Puts Pressure on UN </F>
Security Council Members"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Athens, 18 Feb (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes confirmed on Thursday evening [17 February] in 
Athens that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin had sent a 
letter to those countries in the UN Security Council with troops 
in Bosnia. In the letter, he stated that the "ultimatum set by 
NATO is illegal" and "that a new resolution must be adopted in 
the UN Security Council." 
  If Russia did not obtain a satisfactory response on this 
point, then "we cannot be held responsible for the possible 
consequences arising from NATO air strikes against the Bosnian 
Serbs," the Russian president continued. 
  Yeltsin sent this letter to the French, British and Spanish 
Governments. 
  Claes said Yeltsin regretted "not having been sufficiently 
informed of the actions concerning Bosnia, and recalls that the 
ultimatum set by NATO is not covered by resolutions voted by the 
UN Security Council." 
  The Russian foreign minister had declared, however, that 
"air 
strikes could be justified as a final resort." 
  Russian opposition to air strikes is certainly not new, but 
it is the first time the Russian president, who generally is 
moderate in his relations with the West, has adopted such a 
stiff tone. 
  In reaction to Yeltsin's letter, Claes recalled that the 
existing resolutions (836 and 844) "do constitute an adequate 
legal basis for air strikes." "Therefore a new UN Security 
Council resolution is not necessary," the Belgian minister added. 
  "It makes no sense to claim that we want to minimalize 
Russia's role in the Bosnia question. On the contrary, the 
Europe Union [EU] wants Russia and the United States to play a 
more active role in seeking peace in Bosnia," Claes added. 
  Finally the Belgian minister said he was "optimistic" about 
a 
peaceful conclusion to the Sarajevo crisis after the Russian 
announcement of an agreement on the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb 
heavy weapons. 
  On Friday Claes will participate with his Greek and German 
colleagues in a meeting of the European "troika" -- the 
outgoing, current and future EU presidencies -- with the Russian 
Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Friday [18 February], Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl had another telephone conversation with 
Russian President Yeltsin to discuss recent developments 
regarding the withdrawal of all heavy arms from the city of 
Sarajevo, which is being besieged by the Serbs. Government 
Spokesman Dieter Vogel said in Bonn that the main point of the 
conversation was to urge the Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms 
or put them under UN control still before the ultimatum expires 
on Monday. 
  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany, is also involved in Kohl's talks with the Russian 
leadership. According to Vogel, the Federal Government paid 
tribute to Russia's efforts to ease tensions in Sarajevo. The 
Serbian side is now expected to finally raise the siege of the 
Bosnian capital.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Borelli: Berlusconi Is Wrong"] </F>
  [Text] Milan -- Silvio Berlusconi pointed an accusing 
finger at the Milanese judges following the arrest of his 
brother, Paolo. [District Attorney] Saverlo Borelli replied: 
Cavaliere [Berlusconi nickname], you are making a mistake. The 
attorney said: "I understand that when such a close relative is 
affected, the family cannot feel too much warmth for the 
magistrates. In the case of Paolo Berlusconi, however, we had 
all the evidence, serious evidence too, enabling us to make the 
arrest. He himself has admitted to most of this evidence." 
From Arcore [Silvio Berlusconi's residence], for the time being 
there is a simple "no comment" in response to the latest sally 
of the Clean Hands. 
  Meanwhile, the judges continue their examination. After 
being accused of corruption, Paolo Berlusconi risks facing 
another charge, again involving the Cariplo [Savings Bank of the 
Provinces of Lombardy] pension fund money, since he acquired 
three houses built by the Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi's. Borelli 
said: "Paolo Berlusconi has admitted to converting the stocks, 
for which he took brokerage fees and which in reality were the 
proceeds of corruption, by using invoices for nonexistent 
operations for a total of around 1 billion lire [L]." As a 
result, the builder, the president of Edifnord, may now also 
have to face charges of false company reports. The judges 
appear to have decided to take a closer look at the Cantieri 
Riuniti Milanesi's accounts and those of its affiliated 
companies to see which budgets may have been falsified. Any 
possible fresh accusations will depend on what these 
investigations turn up. 
  Paolo Berlusconi's lawyers, after issuing a number of 
versions, spoke again on Saturday [12 February] of a 
"commission." The district attorney, however, did not have too 
many doubts: "Commission in the affairs of a public entity 
amounts to corruption."

<F P=106> [Andreas Unterberger report: Mock Warns West Against </F>
"Bosnian Disaster"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Foreign Minister Alois Mock has commented 
in a very skeptical manner on Western policies vis-a-vis Bosnia 
and the consequences of the ultimatum against the Serbs. "I am 
afraid that, in view of the extremely difficult process of the 
formation of public opinion, the West will no longer have the 
power to implement stages two, three, and four of the ultimatum 
after stage one. What will happen if the first stage does not 
yield the desired result? This will be a real disaster." Mock 
was also critical of the fact that Washington seems to agree to 
Bosnia's partition. "The division is the weakest of all 
solutions. It contains the danger of recurring conflicts in the 
long run. Yet I do not rule out that it will be implemented, 
because at least it will lead to a cease-fire." 
  In the meantime, THE WASHINGTON POST has reported that the 
United States is apparently ready for a compromise in the 
dispute over the control of heavy weapons. Some of the weapons 
might remain on the mountains surrounding Sarajevo, the paper 
quoted U.S. Government officials as saying.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Evacuation Plan Exists for UN </F>
Troops in Bosnia -- Kooijmans Regards Demilitarization of NATO 
as Step to General Peace Settlement"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- In the "worst case scenario," 
Netherlands and other UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops can 
be evacuated from Bosnia and other parts of the former 
Yugoslavia. Defense Minister Ter Beek informed the Second 
Chamber on Wednesday [16 February] that (confidential) plans had 
been drawn up for that eventuality. 
  The troops -- which include 3,100 Netherlanders following 
the 
"deployment" of the reinforced mobile air battalion at the end 
of March -- can be withdrawn from Bosnia if they become, or 
threaten to become, the target of retaliatory acts by the Serbs. 
  In the event, Netherlands transport units will be protected 
by British troops. The signal corps will leave with the 
battalion with which they are on active service. The Nordic 
(Scandinavian) battalion will assume responsibility for the 
logistics unit, comprising roughly 400 men, stationed in Lukavac. 
  "Dutchbat," the battalion of infantrymen from the mobile air 
battalion, will be assigned its own area of responsibility 
(Srebrenica and Zepa in eastern Bosnia), and will have to 
supervise less heavily armed UN troops from other countries in 
the event of evacuation. The evacuation will be carried out as 
quickly as possible from the port of Split using Navy vessels 
from various countries, including the Netherlands. 
  Yesterday, Minister Ter Beek went into the evacuation plans 
in detail; the Chamber expressed concern over the risks run by 
UN troops in Bosnia. 
  Both Ter Beek and Foreign Minister Kooijmans left it in no 
doubt that if the Serbs fail to carry out the desired withdrawal 
of their heavy weaponry around Sarajevo or submit them to UN 
control before the ultimatum -- Monday morning 0000 GMT -- 
expires, then the United Nations and NATO will carry out their 
threat of air strikes on Serbian artillery positions. Both 
ministers maintained that there could be no question of the 
deadline being extended. 
  In addition, the possibility proposed by the United Nations 
of bringing the heavy weapons under radar control was rejected 
by The Hague. Physical control is absolutely essential. 
Moreover, the Netherlands does not support the idea of urgent 
European Union consultations before Monday, as the Greek 
presidency has proposed. 
  NATO and the United Nations must both lend their support to 
air support and air strikes. The authority to give this support 
resides in the first instance with UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's special envoy in Bosnia, the Japanese Akashi. 
Thereafter, the use of air strikes will be jointly decided by 
the commander of the NATO southern sector, U.S. General Boorda, 
and the UNPROFOR commanders in the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia, 
the French General Cot and the British General Rose. 
  According to Kooijmans, an effective ultimatum must make the 
warring factions see that they are heading for disaster. He 
hopes that demilitarization and the placing under UN control of 
the Bosnian capital constitutes a first step toward an overall 
peace settlement. The international community must exploit the 
situation by also guaranteeing to protect the other five "safe 
areas" against the Muslims. 
  Kooijmans and Ter Beek emphasized that the ultimatum 
primarily constitutes a means of exerting political pressure 
with a view to urging the warring factions to resume peace 
talks. Ter Beek said: "The ultimatum will only prove successful 
if there is no need to resort to bombardments. Nonetheless, 
there may, and can, be no misunderstanding the fact that the 
Netherlands and other allies are prepared to go ahead with air 
attacks."

<F P=106> [Interview with former Italian Socialist Party Secretary </F>
Bettino Craxi by Giovanni Negri in Rome; date not given: 
"Craxi: `The More Occhetto Talks, the More He Lies'"] 
  [Text] Hotel Raphael. Craxi comes down to a meeting room. 
  The teleprinters are spewing out heated declarations from 
[Democratic Party of the Left headquarters in Via delle] 
Botteghe Oscure: a conspiracy, a disgrace, a traitor. He 
lights a Salem, a menthol cigarette. 
  [Negri] D'Alema is in trouble. They say that you are the one 
who put him on the spot. 
  [Craxi] Whatever next! I have been saying for ages that I 
would take care of the liars. It is true, I am working on them. 
But I can tell you that in the next few days I shall also be 
turning my attention to the extraterrestrials. 
  [Negri] Extraterrestrials? 
  [Craxi] Yes, those who now pretend that they have been 
living 
on the moon for 20 years, that they do not know how things 
worked. There are lots of extraterrestrials, I even had some in 
my government. They are worse than the liars, who at least 
assume responsibility for the lies that they tell. 
  [Negri] Amato, La Malfa, who do you mean? 
  [Craxi] Pardon me, is there anything else you want to know? 
  [Negri] Yes. Whereas you are paying visits on the public 
prosecutors' offices, PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] deputy 
Correnti is now saying that "justice is too serious a matter to 
be left to the examining magistrates." A reversal of roles? 
  [Craxi] It is politics that cannot be left to the 
magistrates. 
  As to the rest, to date four prosecutors' offices have 
summoned me to elucidate on my speech to the lower house: 
Venice, Turin, Rome, and Milan. I gave the magistrates a few 
examples to back up my denunciation. 
  I cited one case in a hundred. Of course, it is not a good 
thing for the election campaign to be run by the prosecutors' 
offices, but this is what has been happening for two years. 
  [Negri] Let us come back to the point: The PDS general staff 
is describing the D'Alema affair as a slanderous attack on your 
part. 
  [Craxi] The leaders of the PDS, who have opted from the 
outset for lies rather than for ascertaining the truth, are 
using these epithets and talking in these terms in an attempt to 
shore up their own position. This is why I have decided to make 
one of the chapters of my report public by giving it at least to 
those who undertake to pass it on. 
  It is the third of the 18 chapters that I have handed over: 
It demonstrates how a perfectly true account of an episode was 
described by L'UNITA as a "farce." 
  [Negri] Do you know anything about this Morandina, who has 
claimed responsibility for the accounts in Switzerland and was 
the PDS's key man in the Veneto region until just now, its 
delegate in the negotiations as to who is to stand for the 
progressive alliance? 
  [Craxi] No, nothing. But he is a technical man, is he not? 
He must be a highly skilled technician if he has done 
consultancy work for Fiat. 
  [Negri] However, Formica has asked why he gave the money 
back 
if he earned it by providing professional services. 
  [Craxi] Ah, that is something you must ask him; as a 
technician, he will know why he gave it back. 
  [Negri] How do you see politics nowadays, after what has 
happened to you? 
  [Craxi] My expectations are being confirmed. What I thought 
would happen is happening. We shall assess matters up in a few 
months, but meanwhile there is a tragic economic balance sheet. 
The talk is of everything but employment, bankruptcies, 
shutdowns. This is what happens when violence is used. Things 
can only get worse, because you reap what you sow. I hear no 
talk of the real problems in this media-dominated world; it 
looks almost as if there is a real reality and a media reality. 
  [Negri] What do you think of Berlusconi in politics? 
  [Craxi] It is a phenomenon that requires analysis, one that 
is also present is societies that are even more media-oriented 
than our own, such as the United States or even Latin America. 
When I think that from 1976 to 1983 I worked to gain two 
percentage points [for his party], I cannot but ask myself how 
great the change has been. 
  [Negri] Did you give him any advice? 
  [Craxi] He has done it all on his own. He realized that 
there was a lack of leadership, a worrying situation, and he has 
brought the full weight of media to bear. Be that as it may, he 
has his own credentials, with their pros and cons. He has 
demonstrated that he is a good businessman, although the 
transition from business to politics is undoubtedly a leap into 
the unknown. 
  [Negri] How do you see Occhetto getting on in the midst of 
media domination? 
  [Craxi] He has a large part of state television at his 
disposal, but the television screen is also a mirror of truth. 
The more people watch him on television, the more they will be 
able to notice that he is a great liar and that he is not a 
leader capable of running the country. 
  [Negri] Any nostalgia for the old parties? 
  [Craxi] Much of the blame for the collapse of the system can 
be laid at its own door, it had aged badly, but we cannot 
pretend not to see what is replacing it. 
  Notwithstanding its degeneration, the party regime was a 
channel, but now we are facing the unknown. Suffice it to say 
that there are only three days to go before the deadline for 
submitting the lists of candidates, but no one knows yet who 
they will be. Who knows through what centralized filters the 
winning names have to pass. It will soon become clear that we 
are moving out of the party regime into an oligarchy.

  [Text] Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas 
admitted today that he is considering the possibility of 
redeploying to Sarajevo the 130 Spanish blue helmets who are in 
the Bosnian city of Jablanica in response to the request for 
reinforcements made by the head of UN forces in Bosnia. 
  The minister, who spoke to the press after the swearing-in 
of 
the new Army chief of staff, said that for the present, until 
more precise details of the request are known, the Spanish blue 
helmets will remain in the area assigned to them at present -- 
Herzegovina, which is quite a long way from Sarajevo. 
  After admitting the possibility of redeploying the Spanish 
soldiers from Jablanica to Sarajevo, he explained that his first 
concern is the future of the area where the Spanish blue helmets 
are at present, above all the city of Mostar, which is their 
responsibility.

  [Text] Enormous sums for lifting Albania's shockingly 
deficient health care system out of its miserable condition have 
been given over the past three years, but 1.5 billion Danish 
kroner [DKr] from the EU [European Union] Commission is being 
blocked because of Albania's inability to contribute some 
matching funds and because of a bureaucratic conflict between 
the Commission and the Albanian Ministry of Health. 
  "We want funds to set up a food inspection system, but the 
EU 
Commission doesn't want to use funds for this purpose, and so 
all payments to our public health sector have been halted," says 
Dr. Tritan Shehu, Albania's health minister. The EU Commission 
has earmarked DKr48 million, which has simply not been touched. 
In addition, another DKr160 million for renovating hospitals is 
untouched, because the Commission is requiring Albanian economic 
participation. 
  Altogether over the past three years, Albania has been 
granted DKr1.2 billion for EU programs, and the two largest 
grants totaling DKr560 million were outright gifts for this poor 
country. 
  EU Parliament member Freddy Blak, who has investigated the 
catastrophic conditions in Albanian institutions, is meeting 
today with Commission officials to ask for help.

<F P=106> [Report by Pandelis Athanasiadhis] </F>
  [Text] Turkey has been slinking around in the past few days 
and, instigated by military circles, is creating an artificial 
crisis that thickens the cloud over the Balkans. This appraisal 
was outlined by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias at the 
Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee meeting during the 
debate on the bill on establishing embassies in Croatia and 
Slovenia and a consultate in Montenegro. The bill was passed 
unanimously. 
  During the debate, Papoulias said he could not express 
optimism and noted: I do not believe in a dynamic solution. I 
believe any bombings will aggravate the Balkan situation. Asked 
by deputies what would happen after the deadline set by the 
United Nations and NATO expires, Papoulias said nobody gave any 
answer to NATO and the European Union on whether the bombs would 
be the beginning of peace or a more general war. 
  On his meeting in Belgrade, Papoulias said he met patriotic 
steadfastness and that the Serbs showed they are prepared to 
confront any attack.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE (MTH): "Hans Van Den Broek Soon To </F>
Visit FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and 
Athens"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 21 Feb (BELGA) -- Theodhoros Pangalos, the 
Greek minister for European affairs, announced on Monday [21 
February] that Hans Van den Broek, the European Commissioner for 
external political relations, will in the next few days pay 
successive visits to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
(FYROM) and Greece in an effort to identify more precisely the 
reasons for the dispute between the two countries. The dispute 
escalated suddenly last week, after the Greek decision to close 
the port of Salonika to all trade destined for FYROM. 
  Mr. Pangalos, whose country currently occupies the 
presidency 
of the European Union Council of Ministers, continued: "The 
European Commission has taken the initiative to send Hans Van 
den Broek to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Yugoslavia 
-- FYROM] and then to Athens to assess the new situation in the 
region. (...) The Commission decided to ask for legal 
clarification enabling it to determine whether or not it should 
refer the case to the European Court of Justice." 
  At Breydel (European Commission headquarters) it is 
considered that Greek sanctions against FYROM are incompatible 
with Community treaties. 
  A Commission spokesman said on Monday: "The Greek decisions 
clearly break trading regulations." 
  In this type of situation, the jurisprudence of the European 
Court of Justice requires that the sanctioning country must 
present evidence that it is subject to "law and public safety 
difficulties that it is unable to deal with," the spokesman said. 
  The Greek minister, who chaired a meeting of the Twelve 
devoted mostly to FYROM and preparing for Tuesday's negotiations 
with the four candidate countries on Community enlargement, did 
not hide the fact that Greece had been the target of a running 
fire of criticism from its partners in the European Twelve, 
annoyed by the decision taken unilaterally by Athens and 
skeptical as to its legal basis. 
  "Several countries have criticized the content of the Greek 
Government's decision and the way in which the Greeks announced 
it to their partners," he said at a news conference. 
  Mr. Pangalos added, however, that "the Greek Government has 
decided to lay on the table all the legal arguments that 
justified its decision," although he did not say what these 
arguments were. 
  The Greek minister merely gave an enigmatic allusion to 
excessive oil imports that seemed to suggest that Skopje would 
be reselling part of its purchases to Belgrade, thus bypassing 
the international embargo imposed on Serbia by the United 
Nations. 
  He told journalists: "Twelve million tonnes of oil were sent 
(last year) from Salonika to FYROM, while FYROM itself can only 
use 5 million tonnes. It is up to you to decide where the 
remaining oil ends up."

  [Text] Ankara, Feb 20 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister 
Antonin Baudys today said his peace initiative on Bosnia was 
based on a non-military principle and did not reckon on the use 
of foreign armies there. 
  Talking to journalists aboard a plane en route to Turkey, he 
said that an analysis of the situation in Bosnia had shown that 
the possibility of a peaceful settlement in the area was almost 
equal to zero. 
  In Bosnia, each of the three warring parties to the 
conflict, 
the Catholic Croats, the Orthodox Serbs and the Muslims, has its 
supporters abroad to whom it trusts, Baudys said and added that 
his initiative ensued from this very prerequisite. 
  Baudys's initiative, presented at a press conference in 
Prague yesterday, envisages the creation of a UN executive 
goodwill committee which would oversee the peace process in 
Bosnia and in which selected countries, such as Russia, Greece, 
Pakistan, Turkey, France and Italy, would participate. 
  According to Baudys, Bosnia would be administered by a 
police 
force and an unbiased UN committee with powers freely obtained 
from the three hostile parties for a definite period of time. 
  Baudys said he was open to any discussion concerning more 
detailed information or variants to his proposal providing the 
world community showed interest in it. 
  He confirmed he had not consulted the initiative with 
government or parliament but only with a group of his friends. 
He, however, did not elaborate whether the group included some 
government members, for instance Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec. 
  Baudys said he expected to get first foreign response in 
Ankara.

  [Text] Ankara Feb 21 (CTK) -- Turkish Defence Minister 
Mehmet Golhan today practically rejected a personal initiative 
on a solution to the situation in Bosnia put forward by Antonin 
Baudys, his Czech counterpart. 
  At his meeting with Baudys, who is currently on a three-day 
visit to Ankara, Golhan said that the initiative "does not 
reflect the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina." The 
Turkish side above all rejects the assumption that the conflict 
was religiously motivated. 
  "In our opinion, it is above all necessary to keep intact 
the 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
a state recognised by the United Nations and the international 
community," Golhan said, adding that "Bosnia and Herzegovina 
must not be partitioned." 
  He hinted that Ankara's view is that the Bosnian (mainly 
Muslim) Government led by President Alija Izetbegovich is the 
only legal party to the conflict. 
  Handing over powers to an executive goodwill committee is 
seen as inadequate because it basically involves the division of 
the republic, Golhan said. 
  At the same time, however, Golhan praised Baudys's 
initiative, saying that "similar proposals contribute to ending 
the war in Bosnia and that is what makes them welcome."

<F P=106> [Report by Gillian Tett in Brussels: "Safety Fear Over East </F>
Europe Nuclear Plants"] 
  [Text] East Europe's ageing nuclear reactors will present a 
serious hazard unless more money is provided for their 
renovation and East European governments agree to implement the 
Vienna convention on nuclear safety, Foratom, the European 
nuclear industry body, warned yesterday. 
  Speaking in Brussels, Dr Claus Berke, president of Foratom, 
said that in spite of growing Western concerns about the safety 
of the plants in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident nearly 
eight years ago, attempts to bring them into line with Western 
safety standards were now almost entirely blocked in Russia, the 
Ukraine and Belarus. 
  One reason for this is a lack of funds -- although Foratom 
has calculated that DM15bn [German marks] would be needed to 
carry out the necessary safety work, only $1.7bn of funds had 
been offered so far, the group said. 
  However, the most significant reason for the delay has been 
the refusal of Western companies to carry out the necessary 
replacement work, because of the failure by the governments in 
Russia, Ukraine and Belarus to sign the Vienna convention on 
nuclear safety. 
  This ensures that Western companies carrying out renovation 
work on East European nuclear plants will be not be liable for 
civil claims in the event of a nuclear explosion. 
  "It is because of this risk (of being sued) that Western 
industry has become increasingly reluctant to continue working 
in those states which have not signed and implemented the Vienna 
convention," said Mr Jonathan Heller, of the Foratom secretariat. 
  He pointed out that so far virtually no replacement work had 
been carried out in any of the nuclear plants in Russia or the 
Ukraine, although companies had been allowed to proceed with 
analysis. 
  The Ukraine has five nuclear power plants, including the 
infamous Chernobyl plant. Russia has nine, with the plant in St 
Petersburg -- of a similar design to Chernobyl -- supplying 40 
per cent of the city's electricity. 
  Foratom said yesterday that efforts were now being made to 
develop interim commitments with the separate states which would 
allow Western companies to evade liability. 
  The Lithuanian Government recently amended its laws to allow 
ABB group to renovate the Ignalina plant in Lithuania, and 
Foratom hopes that other groups like Siemens will also be able 
to benefit from similar agreements. 
  Faced with a declining market in West Europe, East Europe is 
regarded as a rich source of potential business for the European 
and US nuclear industry. 
  However, Foratom admitted that the uncertain outcome of the 
Russian elections was now making it increasingly difficult for 
them to persuade the Russian Government to take similar action. 
  "It is not very high on the Russian Government's agenda," 
said Mr Heller, who added that even if the delay was resolved it 
would take some three to four years before East European nuclear 
plants were brought into line with Western safety standards.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "F-16s Are Totally Capable of </F>
Intervening in Bosnia, Air Force Says"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 17 Feb (BELGA) -- On Thursday [17 
February] the Air Force "relativized" the "weaknesses" 
attributed by the media to its F-16 fighter aircraft, and 
affirmed that its planes and pilots were totally capable of 
participating in operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina alongside the 
allied countries, if the government decided to send it on 
missions in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Thanks to their advanced on-board systems, Belgian F-16's 
were able to carry out precise aerial bombardments against 
traditional targets, the Air Force staff said in a statement. 
  The current absence of electronic countermeasures (ECM) -- 
until the delivery of the first systems, which will take place 
at the start of next year -- could also be overcome, the Air 
Force explained: Either by having recourse to electronic 
warplanes owned by other countries, or by "borrowing" or 
"renting" certain items of ECM equipment from other NATO 
partners, thanks to a mutual support procedure. 
  The use of ECM pods does not require specific training for 
pilots, the Air Force staff said. 
  As for the ability to carry out precise bomb attacks on 
targets -- such as the artillery pieces surrounding Sarajevo -- 
the Air Force stressed that its F-16's were already able to 
carry out precise air attacks against traditional targets. 
  In order to carry out so-called surgical attacks on very 
small targets and limit damage to the surrounding area to a 
strict minimum, it would be necessary to use guiding weapons and 
systems which were not yet available to the Air Force, the 
statement added. It nevertheless noted that Belgian pilots could 
very soon start to be trained in using this type of weapon, 
thanks to the purchase of AGM-65 "Maverick" air-to-ground 
infrared missiles, which the government approved last year. 
  While waiting for these missiles, Belgian F-16's could carry 
out precision attacks using laser-guided bombs, by modifying the 
current bombs using a "relatively cheap" guiding kit. However, 
another (allied) plane or ground troops would have to 
"illuminate" the target with a laser beam, the Air Force noted. 
Training in this technique could be done in a short period of 
one to two weeks, according to the Air Force. 
  The Air Force said that therefore it was "totally capable of 
and qualified to" participate in integrated operations in the 
former Yugoslavia, and "will do so if the political authorities 
so decide," the statement continued. 
  The Air Force staff noted, however, that it would be "useful 
to acquire some additional equipment" through the mutual support 
procedures while waiting for the command systems to be 
delivered, in order to "reduce risks" and "increase the 
efficiency" (of its planes).

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "Kooijmans Wants Sarajevo Under UN </F>
Control"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Text] Hilversum/Paris, 22 Feb (ANP) -- Netherlands Foreign 
Minister Pieter Kooijmans is in favor of placing Sarajevo under 
UN control as quickly as possible. The government spokesman 
declared Monday evening [21 February] on NOS [Netherlands 
Broadcasting Foundation] television that the withdrawal of heavy 
weapons around the Bosnian capital had brought a decent 
settlement within reach. 
  Kooijmans said that following the positive outcome of the 
NATO ultimatum, the international community must not sit back 
and relax. "There must be a follow-up," said the minister, 
pointing to the proposals laid out in the original peace plan 
for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Both Sarajevo (United Nations) and 
Mostar (European Union) should have to be placed under 
multinational control over a two-year period. "During this 
time, it must be possible to reach a solution for these two 
cities," estimated Kooijmans. 
  The Netherlands minister does not believe that opting for UN 
control would mean agreeing actually to carve up the Bosnian 
capital. Kooijmans pointed out that Sarajevo was not a divided 
city two years ago before civil war broke out, but rather a city 
where different population groups lived separately in their own 
quarters of the city. In his opinion, UN supervision must serve 
precisely to prevent the division of the city. "The United 
Nations must ensure that there can be freedom of movement 
throughout the whole of Sarajevo." 
  Moreover, Kooijmans believes the United Nations should also 
guarantee free access to Sarajevo for people and products during 
the administrative takeover. 
(In a televised speech given Monday evening in Paris, French 
President Francois Mitterrand had also called for Sarajevo to be 
placed under UN authority -- ANP editor's note). 
  (According to Western diplomatic sources, the members of the 
UN Security Council are considering a resolution to this effect. 
In addition, there is talk of establishing three "safe areas," 
namely the cities of Mostar, Vitez, and Maglaj -- ANP editor's 
note).

<F P=106> [Report by Patrick Wintour and Owen Bowcott: "IRA Response </F>
`Key to Peace in Ulster'"] 
  [Text] A political settlement in Northern Ireland will be 
difficult if the IRA does not accept the Downing Street 
Declaration, a Northern Ireland Office minister has admitted. 
  Ministers have insisted for weeks they are not waiting for 
an 
IRA/Sinn Fein response but are pushing ahead with efforts to 
find agreement between political parties on a predominantly 
internal settlement. 
  In an interview in today's BELFAST TELEGRAPH, however, 
Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for 
developing the suspended inter-party talks, concedes that peace 
and a political settlement are "inextricably linked." 
  "The declaration and the talks are part and parcel of the 
same process," he said. "I don't believe you can have peace 
without a widely acceptable political settlement and I think you 
probably can't have a widely acceptable political settlement 
without peace." His comments imply that without the IRA 
renouncing violence, the prospect of inter-party talks reaching 
agreement are slim. 
  Mr Ancram's comments come on the eve of the meeting between 
the Irish Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and John Major at Downing 
Street to review progress of the inter-party talks as well as 
Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration signed by both 
governments before Christmas. 
  Yesterday, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick 
Mayhew, said that he was hoping to see new institutions of joint 
co-operation between the North and south of Ireland set up as 
part of his package designed to bring agreement between Dublin, 
London and the four constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. 
  He welcomed "any step that is intended to develop 
co-operation on economic and other matters." He thought that 
the new institutions "could be undertaken...without impinging on 
the sovereignty of Northern Ireland." 
  Sir Patrick, speaking in the Commons, was pressed by his 
shadow, Kevin McNamara, on whether new North-South bodies 
dealing with issues like as the economy or infrastructure should 
have an executive role, based on ground rules laid down by both 
governments. 
  Sir Patrick argued that "any organisation, call it a board 
or 
a structure, should have clear objectives, with clearly defined 
lines of authority, coming from wherever it is appropriate, 
whether it is Westminster, Dublin, or any subsequently 
established legislative body." 
  The British Government sent secret outline proposals to 
Dublin this month on the extension of co-operation between the 
two parts of Ireland. 
  The Ulster Unionists would like the bodies to be almost 
exclusively consultative, but are willing to see the British 
representatives drawn from a Northern Ireland assembly. 
  James Molyneaux, the Unionists' leader, indicated that 
representives of a proposed Ulster assembly could talk to the 
South, as long as "the sovereignty of Northern Ireland remained 
undiminished."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Greek Disgrace"] </F>
  [Text] Convention requires that the state holding the 
presidency of the European Union [EU] show restraint in pushing 
its national views and interests where these are at odds with 
those of its partners. 
  Greece gave some sign of observing that convention last week 
when it allowed the EU and NATO to adopt resolutions threatening 
air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. But on Tuesday [15 
February] it threw presidentialism to the winds by banning The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] from using the 
Greek port of Thessaloniki, which had become its main lifeline 
since war and sanctions cut off access to the Adriatic. 
  Such unilateral interference with the EU's external trade by 
a member state is of dubious legality, and should be challenged 
in the European Court of Justice. Politically, it is an affront 
to Greece's partners, which are unanimous in wanting to help 
Macedonia, and thoroughly misguided even from the point of view 
of Greek national interests -- as indeed Greek policy has been 
ever since Macedonia declared its independence two years ago. 
  Greece insists on seeing the use by a neighbouring state of 
the name "Macedonia" and of symbols derived from ancient Macedon 
as a threat to its territorial integrity. Unlike Bulgaria 
(which has much better reason to feel unnerved by the emergence 
of a state whose national "language" is in fact a dialect of 
Bulgarian, spoken by a significant minority of the Bulgarian 
population), Greece has failed to see that the stabilisation of 
Macedonia is very much a Greek interest, since its collapse 
would bring the war of Yugoslav succession right up to Greece's 
borders. 
  Such a collapse is by no means a purely theoretical danger. 
Macedonia has a large and discontented Albanian minority, so far 
represented within the coalition government but coming 
increasingly under radical leadership manipulated from the 
Albanian capital, Tirana, while threatened by the equally 
radical Macedonian nationalist opposition. A much smaller Serb 
minority had settled its grievances with the government last 
August, only to see its leader resign after a visit to Belgrade, 
whereupon a new leader (born in Serbia) repudiated the agreement 
and produced a new set of demands. Serbia's President Milosevic 
weeps crocodile tears over the dangers of Albanian separatism. 
"If such processes continue, I am afraid that there will be 
nothing for Greece to recognise," he told the Greek foreign 
minister last November. 
  To resist such pressures, Macedonia badly needs political 
and 
economic support. In depriving it of its last main trade route, 
Mr Papandreou is pursuing domestic political advantage, at the 
risk of a wider Balkan war. His compatriots should realise, if 
he does not, that in so doing he adds to the intense irritation 
with Greece already felt by many of its EU partners. That can 
hardly be a wise policy for a country so heavily dependent on EU 
funds.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The General Expects"] </F>
  [Text] Any country, basking in the reflected glory of a 
celebrated general making an outstanding success of an 
international military operation, might find it difficult to 
turn a deaf ear to his request for help. 
  Britain is rightly proud of Lieutenant-General Sir Michael 
Rose, the man who has led the move from resolution to strength, 
from ceasefire into separation of forces. Yet John Major 
yesterday answered General Rose's plea for urgent reinforcements 
with a promise of no more than 60 mortar-locating experts. 
  This is hardly the whole-hearted commitment to the NATO 
strategy of threatening force to halt the bombardment of 
Sarajevo which Mr Major was enjoining on President Yeltsin, 
although the Russians appeared to have reduced the tension last 
night. The Prime Minister insisted that Britain was meeting its 
obligations by redeploying two units from Vitez to Sarajevo. 
Britain already had over 2,300 troops in Bosnia, he said; it 
was now the turn of other nations to provide reinforcements to 
monitor the surrender of weapons. 
  It is true that Britain responded quickly to the United 
Nations request for troops to protect the humanitarian convoys, 
and has the second largest contingent in Bosnia after the 
French. But Britain has also been consistent in its opposition 
to battlefield intervention and in its refusal to sanction 
either air strikes or a change in the role of UN troops. 
  Last week Britain lost the argument in NATO, and agreed both 
to the threat of force and the de facto change in the terms of 
the UN mission from peace keeping to peace enforcement. Partly 
to cover its embarrassment and to demonstrate a resolution 
wholly lacking in its niggardly attitude to the new NATO 
strategy, the Government trumpeted its refusal to contemplate 
fresh contingents for Bosnia. 
  General Rose wants British troops in Sarajevo because they 
have proved to be among the best in Bosnia. The attempt to 
secure Serb and Bosnian Government guns is the most ambitious 
military task yet undertaken by UNPROFOR [UN Protective Forces], 
the UN forces, demanding tact, resolution and courage as 
tensions and tempers rise. 
  Largely because of Northern Ireland, British soldiers are 
more experienced than others in dealing with terrorist warlords 
and suspicious civilians; consequently they have proved 
themselves outstandingly capable in Central Bosnia. Commanders 
have brushed aside bureaucracy and rescued civilians. They have 
broken blockades on the convoy routes. They have remained 
impartial and uncorrupted. 
  Redeployment from Vitez will leave a gap in an area as 
fought 
over as Sarajevo, where aid is as short and atrocities as 
common. Mr Major clearly believes that this gap should be filled 
by someone else -- Belgians perhaps, or non-European countries 
that might prove as effective as the Jordanians have been. 
  This misses the point. Countries such as Jordan cannot send 
more troops because the UN is incapable of paying them. Britain 
can afford to wait for reimbursement. The latest opinion poll 
shows that the British public is far readier to accept air 
strikes than the Government appears to be. 
  The American refusal to respond to the UN call confirms the 
confusion and double-standards that have marked out the Clinton 
Administration policy on Bosnia. The Russian decision to send 
troops may be helpful in persuading the Serbs to give up their 
weapons -- or it may encourage their resistance. 
  Britain has long prided itself as "punching above its 
weight". All-round capability and a highly professional army 
mean that the country remains a formidable military power, one 
that has used this strength to reinforce Western values and UN 
resolutions. Mr Major's refusal to respond to a call for more 
troops just when their presence is most critical is yet another 
demonstration of half-heartedness over the NATO decision. It is 
a fudge that satisfies no one, least of all General Rose.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Steel Nerves, Serbian Guns"] </F>
  [Text] If ever there was a time for strong nerves and unity 
of purpose in the Bosnia crisis, this is it. 
  Of brave men there is no shortage. Lieutenant-General Sir 
Michael Rose and the exemplary soldiers of the French contingent 
now deploying along the lines in Sarajevo offer proof of that. 
But unity of purpose among the Western allies, often fragile 
during this war, must be enforced with ruthless will. A few 
powers still provide the military reserves to underwrite the 
world's moral outrage. They need to steel themselves to hold 
fast to their resolve in the face of prevarication, cunning and 
bluff. Serbian guns must be removed from within 12.5 miles of 
Sarajevo or placed under United Nations control before the NATO 
deadline expires. 
  Nothing else is thinkable now. No compromise, no 
half-hearted extension of deadlines, no acceptance of the 
predictable excuses by Dr Karadzic, no tolerance of the whims of 
General Ratko Mladic, the man who used artillery against 
Sarajevo as a village butcher might wield his meat cleaver. It 
is fine and welcome that the urbane Vitaliy Churkin should 
descend upon Pale with a letter from Boris Yeltsin and the 
promise of compliance. But to announce that 400 Russian troops 
serving with the United Nations will be rushed to the area 
smacks of the days when Soviet pawns were shuffled around a Cold 
War chessboard, here to block an opponent's move, there to seize 
an opportunity. 
  The Russians should briskly be invited to play their part in 
the full implementation of UN resolution 638, which they 
supported in its call for "all necessary measures" to help 
UNPROFOR [UN Protective Forces] to fulfill its mandate. The 
Serbs have feasted upon inconsistency and with skill exploited 
every weak link in Western policy. We are told that the 
generals and bureaucrats are now in agreement as to what 
constitutes United Nations "control" of Serbian artillery 
remaining within the radius. It must mean nothing less than 
disabling the weapons or placing them in the custody of properly 
armed UN troops with orders to fight to defend them. This 
latest Russian twist makes it all the more imperative for NATO 
and the United Nations to sort out the chain of command and 
responsibility in former Yugoslavia. 
  If anyone doubted that the stakes in Bosnia now far outweigh 
the intrinsic issues in this miserable contest of intolerance, 
let them reflect upon the events of this week. Greece bludgeons 
Macedonia and scorns its European partners. Russia strives to 
recapture its role in the Balkans. Factions in Washington push 
policy forwards and backwards and the great nations of West 
Europe seem united only in their shared discomfort. And all the 
while, from North Korea to Tehran and, yes, Algiers, sharp and 
hostile eyes await the outcome of this test.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Now Tuzla and Mostar"] </F>
  [Text] So far, so good. The shelling of Sarajevo has been 
stopped. NATO has not actually launched any air strikes, but no 
one should doubt that its threat to do so was necessary. 
Perhaps the Russian intervention was also necessary. Certainly 
it made it much easier for the Serbs to comply (more or less) 
with NATO's ultimatum without loss of face. But without the 
ultimatum and the threat Russia would almost certainly not have 
intervened in this way, and even if it had done so the Serbs 
would have been less likely to comply with Russian requests. 
  As it is, the ultimatum has had to be interpreted creatively 
to make it possible for General Sir Michael Rose, the UN 
commander, to certify compliance. The effectiveness of UN 
"control" over weapons remaining within the 20 km-radius 
exclusion zone is uncertain. UN member states have lamentably 
failed to provide General Rose with the 3,000 extra troops he 
has requested, thereby continuing the pattern of 
irresponsibility which has characterised all previous 
international "action" in the former Yugoslavia. 
  France and Britain, the two leading contributors to the 
existing UN force (UNPROFOR), have smugly refused General Rose's 
request, suggesting it is for others to take a share of the 
burden. However justified this implied criticism of the U.S., 
it is hardly a constructive response, nor is it calculated to 
strengthen Atlantic solidarity in the next phase of the crisis. 
Both countries should recognise that their national prestige 
and interests are now irrevocably bound up with the UN operation 
in Bosnia. If the operation fails for lack of manpower they may 
console themselves by blaming the U.S., but it is they who will 
look most foolish. 
<H5>  Strategic Significance </H5>
  With luck, the cease-fire in and around Sarajevo will now 
hold, at least for a time. The Serbs will probably move their 
weapons to other fronts of greater strategic significance, such 
as Brcko and Bihac, where Bosnian Government forces are still in 
a position to threaten communications between the Serb-held 
areas in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia proper. But a cease-fire 
does not in itself mean that the siege of Sarajevo is lifted -- 
though that was NATO's declared objective when it ordered the 
withdrawal of heavy weapons. 
  Likewise, the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo would not 
relieve the suffering in other parts of Bosnia, including many 
that the UN has officially taken under its protection. In two 
of these (Srebrenica and Tuzla) specific actions ordered, on 
pain of airstrikes, by last month's NATO summit have yet to take 
place. And even the relief of all these places would not bring 
peace to Bosnia as a whole. 
<H5>  Exploit Momentum </H5>
  So it is vital to exploit the momentum of the small success 
gained in Sarajevo before it evaporates. General Rose was right 
to press ahead yesterday with plans to open roads into and out 
of the city and to repair water, electricity and gas supplies. 
He is right, and should be given the fullest support by NATO 
and the UN Security Council, in seeking to extend the Sarajevo 
model to other parts of Bosnia. Opening the airport at Tuzla, 
through which desperately needed food, medicine and shelter 
could be brought to more than l million civilians in central 
Bosnia, is an obvious priority. But the plight of Mostar, which 
is worse than that of Sarajevo, must not be forgotten. 
  The Serbs are not the only villains in this war. It is Croat 
forces, with active support from the Croatian regular army, that 
have destroyed the historic bridge of Mostar and are still 
raining down shells on the Moslem population trapped on the east 
bank of the Neretva. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, a 
protege of Germany and the Vatican, has still given no 
indication that he will withdraw his troops from western 
Hercegovina. An ultimatum to the Croats around Mostar would be 
amply justified, would involve fewer political risks than that 
to the Serbs around Sarajevo, and would make it easier to 
maintain Russian support for a policy of firmness towards the 
Serbs. 
  It is good, too, that U.S. and Russian officials are meeting 
with those of the EU [European Union] and UN in Bonn today, to 
push forward the diplomatic process. Only if the U.S., Russia 
and Germany are very firm in urging concessions on their 
respective proteges in Bosnia is there any hope of peace.

<F P=106> [Report by Nicholas Schoon, environment correspondent: "UK </F>
Bows to Ban on Dumping N-Waste at Sea"] 
  [Text] The government has bowed to international pressure 
and promised not to dump nuclear waste at sea, Gillian Shephard, 
Minister of Agriculture, said yesterday. 
  Britain had wanted the option of dumping the Royal Navy's 
decommissioned nuclear submarines on the sea bed. There are 
already six out-of-action vessels, and by the end of the century 
a further 11 are expected to be taken out of service. 
  But with three days to run before a treaty deadline expires, 
Mrs Shephard said that the UK would accept a formal ban under 
the London Convention. When 45 countries met in London last 
November a large majority voted for the ban, but Britain, 
France, Belgium, China and Russia reserved the right to file an 
objection by 21 February and ignore it. Belgium and France have 
since sided with the ban. 
  In a written answer to Labour's environment spokesman, Chris 
Smith, Mrs Shephard said Britain had not dumped any radioactive 
waste from ships since 1983. The UK was already committed to a 
moratorium on sea dumping until 2008 under a different treaty. 
  "The scientific evidence shows that dumping at sea, carried 
out under controlled conditions, causes no harm to the marine 
environment and poses no threat to human health," she said. 
"This has been confirmed by careful monitoring over many years 
and studies have shown it to be the best practicable 
environmental option for the disposal of certain types of 
radioactive waste." 
  "Nevertheless, the UK recognises that the weight of 
international opinion on this matter means that such dumping is 
not, in any event, a practical proposition. We have, therefore, 
decided to accept the ban," the minister added. 
  Mrs Shephard pointed out that there would be a scientific 
re-evaluation of the ban in 25 years. "The UK will be ready to 
reopen discussions in the Convention at any time, should the 
weight of opinion change in favour of accepting the scientific 
conclusions." 
  Bridget Woodman, a Greenpeace campaigner, said: "It's a bit 
of good news. But if they can bow to international pressure on 
radioactive waste dumping, why can't they respond to all the 
international concern about the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant 
and stop it from opening?"

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- For Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the 
Serbs' withdrawal from the circle around Sarajevo is a "new 
chance" for peace in the former Yugoslavia. It is now possible 
"that the terrible murders will come to an end. First in this 
place and then in the others," Kohl said at the Hamburg 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Congress on Monday [21 
February]. 
  In the next few weeks, all one's power must be used to 
achieve an overall plan. Kohl advocated an international 
conference with "high-ranking" participants. 
  The Germans must not hide in a corner "when storms are 
blowing. Nobody will buy that," Kohl said. Such an attitude is 
a "shame for our country."

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- On Monday [21 February], FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel stated with satisfaction that the 
objectives of the NATO ultimatum on Sarajevo have been reached. 
Virtually all heavy weapons of the Bosnian Serbs have been 
removed from the 20-km zone or placed under UN supervision, he 
said on Deutschlandradio. Since this is only a small step on the 
road ahead, political talks must begin immediately, Kinkel said. 
It cannot be right that the weapons that have been withdrawn 
appear in other combat zones, for example, Tuzla and Bihac. 
  Kinkel evaluated the solution achieved in and around 
Sarajevo 
as a beginning that will "hopefully" be translated into an 
"overall solution," because there are "many Sarajevos." The 
cease-fire has to be consolidated and the siege of the Bosnian 
capital has to be called off. 
  There is no reason for euphoria, the minister said. The main 
work is starting now. Here the Germans could offer their 
"mediating good offices." Croats and Muslims also have to be 
brought together, in order to achieve a political solution. 
Kinkel said that Russia's role is important.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Christian Social Union [CSU] 
Chairman Theo Waigel has advocated tough action against the 
Serbian besiegers of Sarajevo. "If the Serbs do not withdraw 
their artillery pieces, bombs will have to fall. Then the 
Germans must not stand aside," Waigel said during the CSU's 
traditional fish dinner in Schwabing in Munich on Friday evening 
[18 February]. 
  One cannot sit forever in front of the television screens 
and 
express one's dismay, Waigel said. "Action must finally be 
taken now." The threat, with well-aimed air strikes against the 
Serbian artillery positions and lines, is the only promising 
means "to stop the murderers, rapists, and looters."

Bundestag Group, recommends that German soldiers not use the 
airplanes with the AWACS monitoring system in the event of NATO 
air strikes against Serbian positions around Sarajevo. He told 
the WESTDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, which is published in Duesseldorf, 
that the temporary directive of the Federal Constitutional Court 
does not cover participation in combat missions outside the NATO 
area, even though AWACS serve only an observer function. The 
Karlsruhe ruling must come first, he said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Manfred Brunner, chairman of the 
Association of Free Citizens, has once again come out against a 
Europe modeled along the Maastricht Treaty. Speaking to 
approximately 300 participants at the European congress of his 
organization in Bonn on Saturday [19 February], Brunner said 
that the 12 June German election to the European Parliament 
makes up for the referendum that was not permitted to be held on 
Maastricht. Brunner, former chairman of the Bavarian Free 
Democratic Party of Germany, told the Federal Government that 
its policy is not accepted by the people. The government must 
again learn to represent national interests, he said. 
  Brunner supports a Europe that is the fatherland of the 
fatherlands in the spirit of Charles de Gaulle. His party is 
against bureaucratic centralism in Brussels and is for a Europe 
of the free peoples and equal rights, he stressed. 
  The Bonn meeting discussed the ticket for the European 
elections, which is to be headed by Brunner. According to its 
own information, the "Association of Free Citizens" currently 
has approximately 120 members. Erwin Wickert, former German 
ambassador to the PRC, participated in the conference, which was 
chaired by Deputy Party Chairman Professor Karl Schachtschneider 
(Nuremberg).

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] does not want to commit itself to a date for deciding on a 
statement concerning a potential coalition after the 16 October 
Bundestag elections. After the FDP Presidium's weekly meeting 
on Monday [21 February], FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel only said 
that the FDP will announce "where we will go" at an "appropriate 
time" before the elections. 
  He left it open whether this is to be done at the federal 
party congress in September. The Presidium decided on Monday to 
move the date of the congress, which was originally planned for 
17-18 September in Berlin, to 3-4 September in Nuremberg in 
order to gain more time before the Bundestag elections. The 
liberals want to make an election appeal in Nuremberg. The 
election program is to be adopted at a preceding federal party 
congress in Rostock on 3-5 June.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- Chancellor Kohl has said 
that securing employment and creating jobs is the first joint 
duty. "I am worried because we now have more than 4 million 
unemployed in Germany as a whole," Kohl said on Friday [18 
February], according to the prereleased text of his speech at 
the opening of the Ambiente consumer products fair in Frankfurt. 
  In order to reduce unemployment, there must be a 
considerable 
increase in the number of part-time jobs offered, the chancellor 
said. According to the text, the chancellor said the conclusion 
of the collective agreement in the chemical industry with lower 
pay for newly employed long-term unemployed and entrants is "an 
important signal." 
  European Economic and Monetary Union, which entered its 
second stage at the beginning of the year, is also a basis for 
employment, growth, and prosperity in the FRG, Kohl said at the 
beginning of the world's largest exhibition of consumer goods. 
In 1992, Germany exported goods valued at 365 billion German 
marks to countries of the European Union [EU]. Thus, since its 
founding in 1957, Germany's exports to the EU countries 
increased almost twice as much as to the rest of the world. 
  At the Ambiente spring fair, almost 4,800 exhibitors from 
more than 70 countries are showing products for the table and 
kitchen, household and lighting ideas, and fancy goods.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Social Democratic Party [SPD] has 
sharply rejected Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl's recent 
criticism Johannes Rau, the SPD candidate for the office of 
federal president. Anyone who, like Kohl, accuses Rau of "being 
a traitor to humaneness" shows that he has "lost touch with 
reality, good behavior, and morals in treating others in a 
democratic society," SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen said 
in Bonn on Friday [18 February]. "Those who talk like that are 
becoming a danger to democratic culture and the future of our 
country." 
  The chancellor had attacked Rau in connection with the SPD's 
former policy on Germany during an interview broadcast on ZDF, 
Second German Television.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the view of Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP] Chairman Klaus Kinkel, Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
showed the will to fight and win with his speech at the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Federal Congress in Hamburg. 
The admonitions by the CDU chairman to his opponents in the 
party were clear and unmistakable, Kinkel said on Monday [21 
February] after a meeting of the FDP Presidium in Bonn. Kohl 
has probably laid the foundation for bringing his party out of 
the current low in the polls. 
  According to Kinkel, the FDP emphatically welcomes the fact 
that Kohl did not leave any doubt that he wants the coalition of 
the CDU/Christian Social Union and FDP to succeed. In addition, 
the foreign minister considered it positive that the chancellor 
came out against a grand coalition at the federal level. 
  The FDP politician called on the CDU to make a clear 
commitment to Europe at its party congress. There are some 
forces in the CDU that want to reinterpret Europe and want 
Germany to follow a special path. Kinkel said anyone who wants 
to reduce Germany's share in the process of European unification 
is cutting off the branch on which he is sitting.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- In the view of Guenter Verheugen, 
federal manager of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Chairman Helmut Kohl did not 
answer any of the central questions regarding German policy in 
his speech at the Hamburg congress. Kohl did not cite one 
specific instrument to reform the social state, safeguard 
Germany as an economic location, and combat the dramatic 
unemployment. "This chancellor lacks the strength for the sober 
and honest determination of his position," Verheugen said in a 
statement. 
  The optimism demonstrably expressed by Kohl and his party 
cannot cover up the CDU's glaring inability to master the 
challenges of the future. "It is already clear that the 
congress will not lead to improving the people's dramatic loss 
of trust in the largest government party," Verheugen said.

  [Text] Herzogenaurach (DPA) -- Bavarian Minister President 
Edmund Stoiber, Christian Social Union [CSU], once again called 
for a "very strict delineation" toward right-wing radical and 
right-wing extremist parties. When the leader of a right-wing 
radical party says that he has been chosen by fate to save 
Germany, this is "fascist thinking par excellence," Stoiber said 
on Saturday [19 February] at an event organized by the Franken 
association of the Young Union in Herzogenaurach. Republikaner 
chief Franz Schoenhuber had made a statement to this effect at 
his party's Ash Wednesday rally. 
  There was trouble in the CSU last week after it became known 
that former Minister President Max Streibl had met Schoenhuber 
in his private home last November. CSU Chairman Theo Waigel 
said subsequently that the meeting had been a purely personal 
conversation. 
  In Stoiber's view, there is currently "an enormous 
challenge" 
posed by right-wing extremism, which is slightly more dangerous 
than left-wing extremism. The CSU must also be a party of the 
democratic right, but not exclusively so: "The CSU must not be 
small but noble."

  [Text] Bad Boll (DPA) -- In the view of Ignatz Bubis, 
chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, violent 
right-wing extremist organizations should be prosecuted as 
criminal associations. At a meeting of the Protestant Academy 
in Bad Boll, Bubis said on Sunday [20 February]: "Throwing fire 
bombs into asylum-seekers' hostels is just as terrible as 
assassinating Hanns-Martin Schleyer." He does not understand 
why the state does not act against violent rightist 
organizations just as it acted against the terrorist Red Army 
Faction (RAF) in the past, which killed the president of the 
employers' association. 
  In Bubis' view, the problem of rightist violence has been 
played down in Germany far too long. Despite a dangerous 
interconnection of the right-wing extremist scene, politicians 
still speak of individual perpetrators and people who are just 
running along. Addressing approximately 1,000 conference 
participants, Bubis came out against special laws and a 
tightening of the penal code: "The existing instruments are 
absolutely sufficient." However, the judiciary must not orient 
itself primarily "at the lower limit" in meting punishment for 
rightist acts of violence. 
  Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Minister Frieder Birzele (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany) also criticized the many cases of 
incomprehensibly mild punishment. Birzele thinks the danger to 
society posed by right-wing extremists is far greater than the 
threat that has emanated from leftist groups. With 400-500 
right-wing extremists who are ready for violence in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg alone, the circle of potential perpetrators 
is far larger than it ever was in the case of the RAF.

  [Text] Ulm (DPA) -- There were riots at the 
Baden-Wuerttemberg land party congress of the right-wing radical 
Republikaner in Ulm on Sunday [20 February]. Around noon, a few 
hundred demonstrators, who had at first participated in a 
peaceful rally against the Republikaner, tried to break through 
the security cordons around Danube Hall. Policemen pushed them 
back, sometimes using truncheons. 
  At the rally, Ulm Mayor Ivo Goenner (Social Democratic Party 
of Germany) warned against "philistines and intellectual 
arsonists." A democratic republic does not need "these 
Republikaner," he said, addressing approximately 3,000 people. 
Siegfried Pommerenke, land chairman of the German Trade Union 
Federation, warned the parties against "adjusting to the 
right-wing extremists in the race for votes."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi on Recession and </F>
Unemployment, Solutions"] 
  [Text] Rome, 18 Feb (ANSA) -- Italy is still in the middle 
of a recession that has had serious effects on employment, Prime 
Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi conceded at a conference here 
Friday [18 February]. 
  The solutions, Ciampi suggested, lie in "consistent" 
attitudes at the next round of contract renewal talks and by the 
next government, which must pick up where this executive leaves 
off. 
  According to Ciampi, unemployment is caused by both external 
and structural conditions. Tackling both involves focusing on 
macro-economics, such as future labor accords in which wage 
increases are linked to production and private industry is 
encouraged to invest in infrastructures. 
  In the medium- and long-term, Ciampi continued, economic 
policies must follow the lines adopted by the European 
Commission in its job-creation plan, especially concerning 
investments. 
  In Italy in particular, he added, the government must pursue 
privatizations and the streamlining of public administration, 
increasing efficiency. At the same time, the job market must be 
made more "flexible" while maintaining protection for workers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Relaunches the `Heavy Lira' </F>
Proposal"] 
  [Text] Rome, 17 Feb (ANSA) -- Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi 
has once again launched the idea of a "heavy lira." Speaking at 
a press conference with foreign journalists here Wednesday [16 
February], Ciampi noted that he had first made the proposals 
many years ago when he was governor of the Bank of Italy. He 
voiced the hope that the heavy lira would become a reality 
because, as he put it, those three extra zeroes serve no purpose 
and only complicate matters. 
  Ciampi said that he always figured that before the heavy 
lira 
could be introduced, it was necessary for two-digit inflation in 
Italy to be brought down to a one-digit number. 
  Today this has been achieved and Italy finds itself closer 
to 
Europe, the premier added. Because of all the zeroes involved, 
calculating in lire is cumbersome and confusing. A figure like 
1,000 lire is worth 59 cents, while a 100,000 lire banknote, 
Italy's largest, is worth 59.17 dollars. One million dollars in 
Italian money would come to 1,690,000,000 lire. 
  With the heavy lira, one lira would be worth 59 cents; a 50 
lire bill would be worth around thirty dollars, the 100 lire 
banknote would equal close to sixty dollars, and so on.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "BNL, Cantoni Resigns, Sarcinelli </F>
Named Chairman"] 
  [Text] Rome, 17 Feb (ANSA) -- Giampiero Cantoni resigned 
Thursday [17 February] as chairman of the Banca Nazionale del 
Lavoro [BNL, National Bank of Labor], confirming his suspension 
which he announced February 7. Mario Sarcinelli, current Deputy 
Chairman of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, was tapped this evening by the treasury and 
industry ministers to take over Cantoni's job. 
  In a letter sent to the treasury this morning, Cantoni said 
"as I announced with my letter of February 7, I wish to confirm 
that I intend to end my mandate early." 
  Cantoni stepped down shortly before the Bank of Italy 
announced it had handed Rome magistrates details of questionable 
BNL operations unearthed in a recent check and as news broke 
that the BNL chief may have been involved in dubious property 
deals in his home town of Segrate. 
  According to well-informed sources speaking this evening, 
BNL 
will henceforth have three managing directors with Gino Trombi 
brought in from the Banco Ambroveneto to join current managing 
directors Davide Croff and Umberto D'Addosio. Deputy Chairman 
Rodolfo Rinaldi will remain on the board.

<F P=106> [Jose Antich report: "Pujol Demands All Executive Power in </F>
Catalonia"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Jordi Pujol, generalitat [Catalan 
autonomous government] premier and Democratic Convergence of 
Catalonia (CDC) chairman, is seeking a radical model of single 
administration replete with confederal symbolism through a 
direct relationship with the throne. On the eve of his meeting 
with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, EL PAIS has learned the 
contents of the first document drafted by the generalitat 
premier's office to raise Catalonia's autonomy ceiling, to which 
contributions are already being made by the two coalition 
parties -- CDC and Democratic Union of Catalonia -- and which 
will be debated at a specific meeting of their liaison 
committee. Catalan government councillors such as Macia 
Alavedra (Economy), Josep Maria Cullell (Territorial Policy), 
Joan Maria Pujals (Education), and Ignasi Farreras (Labor) are 
acquainted with it, as is Joaquim Pujol, secretary general of 
the Prime Minister's Office. 
  The document, which Jordi Pujol has given to various 
colleagues to seek their suggestions, proceeds from the 
assumption that the Generalitat is the state's ordinary 
representative in Catalonia, in accordance with the Constitution 
and the autonomy statute, although subsequent legislation has 
been diluting this role to the extent of making the autonomous 
community's political significance subsidiary. In fact, the 
document partially develops a brief extemporaneous remark by 
Pujol at his last investiture in April 1992, when he cited the 
pre-1714 model, under the Habsburg rule, as the reference point 
for refounding the Spanish state. The throne would remain as a 
symbolic link -- albeit not the only link -- between the various 
peoples of Spain. 
  The document proceeds from the premise of not reforming the 
Constitution or the statute but making a reinterpretation. Its 
plan is based on the almost total assumption of the functions 
resting with the state's executive power by the Generalitat 
government, thus developing the single administration idea; 
respect for the Cortes' legislative power; respect for the 
judiciary as an independent power (albeit with the autonomous 
government assuming many of the [central] government's powers in 
its relations with it), and respect for the throne in its 
symbolic and moderating roles. 
  The document will be handed over at the anticipated meeting 
between Felipe Gonzalez and Jordi Pujol that is to lay the 
foundations of the so-called "turnabout in autonomy" demanded by 
the Catalan nationalists in order to continue their support for 
the Socialist government. 
  Almost 15 years after the approval of the statute, the 
assessment the document presents is that, in many respects, the 
government has a restrictive view of autonomy and an incorrect 
approach from the legal viewpoint. In order to put into effect 
the state of the autonomies, "there must be a radical change in 
the state's structures," the document states. 
<H5>  Protocol </H5>
  In order to restore what the nationalists believe to be the 
legislators' intention in granting the Generalitat premier the 
highest representation of the Generalitat and the ordinary 
representation of the state in Catalonia (Chapter II, Article 
36, paragraph 2 of the statute), the document proposes preparing 
a number of legal measures concerning, for example, the prime 
minister's role and his place in protocol when he is in 
Catalonia, and the need for all authorities operating in the 
principality, irrespective of the administrations to which they 
belong, to accept its primacy and cooperate with the Generalitat. 
  Ramon Maria Llevadot, director of the Generalitat's central 
legal department, was the technical coordinator of the document, 
which was drawn up on the basis of the contributions of Jordi 
Pujol and, to a lesser extent, other members of his government. 
The document maintains that the current protocol decree is not 
in keeping with the Constitution and the statute. The 
Generalitat's interpretation is that, after the head of state, 
the first place in protocol governing ceremonies taking place in 
Catalonia should belong to the Generalitat premier, not the 
Spanish prime minister. Since he [the premier] represents the 
state, the document argues, his importance is greater than that 
of Felipe Gonzalez, since the latter, in his capacity as prime 
minister, is just the representative of one of the state powers 
-- the executive -- and not even of all of it, since the 
autonomous and municipal administrations are excluded. 
  In order to strengthen the Catalan premier's political role, 
the Generalitat proposes a direct relationship -- without 
intermediaries -- with the head of state. In this new 
framework, Pujol would be the regular vehicle of communication 
with the king for all the Catalan public institutions. An 
initial result would be the disappearance of the figure of the 
minister of the royal visit [ministro de jornada] during visits 
by King Juan Carlos. 
  In line with this is the demand that the Generalitat 
premier's appointment after his election by the Catalan 
parliament be endorsed by the speaker of the house and by the 
king, without the signature of the prime minister, who is 
described as an "extraneous" element. 
  Wherever the Constitution and the statute allow it, the 
nationalists propose using in the most extensive way possible 
the transfer by organic law of powers corresponding to matters 
within the purview of the state which by their very nature are 
capable of transfer or delegation. Article 150, paragraph 2 of 
the Constitution already takes note of this eventuality and, as 
a safeguard for the state, states that "the law will provide in 
each case for the corresponding transfer of financial means, as 
well as the forms of oversight which the state reserves for 
itself." 
  The central administration should adjust to the gradual 
reduction of its powers by cutting its personnel. The 
Generalitat believes that in many cases elements of the state 
peripheral administration will disappear, albeit partially. 
While the corresponding laws on the delegation of powers are 
being approved, it proposes using the method of agreements which 
will enable the Generalitat to extend its powers now. 
  The specific areas in which the Generalitat wishes to assume 
more powers and which it intends to place in the front line of 
its political demands include those affecting territorial 
policy, language, culture -- where it proposes including 
representatives of the Generalitat in the international bodies 
which have functions concerning culture and language -- security 
and public order, justice, the news media, and education.

<F P=106> [L.R. Aizpeolea report: "Pujol Demands That Gonzalez </F>
Accelerate Turnabout in Autonomy"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Generalitat [Catalan autonomous 
government] Premier Jordi Pujol stated yesterday that the time 
has come for the development of autonomy, and that this cannot 
be prolonged indefinitely, as happened with the transfer of 15 
percent of personal income tax. Pujol made these statements 
after meeting unexpectedly with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
at Moncloa Palace for three and a quarter hours. This meeting 
marks the official start of the negotiations on the turnabout in 
autonomy that Jordi Pujol announced months ago. The meeting was 
relaxed, and Pujol did not hesitate to describe it as 
"positive." The Catalan head of government tried to minimize 
the tension created following the publication of a document from 
the Generalitat Premier's Office demanding, among other things, 
a direct relationship with the throne. The report also demanded 
protocol precedence in Catalonia for the Generalitat premier 
over the central government's prime minister. 
  After reaching agreement with the Socialists on economic 
policy -- which resulted in this year's budgets and the labor 
reform -- Pujol is now making his continued support conditional 
on an agreement on autonomy. Convergence and Union's 17 votes 
in the Congress of Deputies are the key to the government's 
securing a parliamentary majority. 
  Yesterday's meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol took the news 
media completely by surprise, since the Generalitat premier 
himself asserted on the previous day that it was not the time to 
hold a meeting because of the tension created by the 
controversial document's publication. 
  Pujol apologized for the deception. "We did not wish to find 
ourselves subjected to news media pressure," he said, but the 
meeting allowed no delay. Both Pujol and Gonzalez himself 
needed to relax the political atmosphere, and the Generalitat 
premier also admitted that this meeting should have been held a 
month ago. 
  The Generalitat premier informed Felipe Gonzalez of the 
contents of the turnabout in autonomy sought by the Generalitat. 
He made five demands for areas of responsibility: Development 
of the autonomous police force, regional planning, public health 
funding, the reform of the peripheral administration, and some 
other outstanding transfers. None of what he put forward goes 
beyond the Catalan statute. 
  Pujol, whose visit to Moncloa Palace coincided with that of 
Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, set no deadlines for 
the negotiations on the development of autonomy, but made it 
clear that they cannot be prolonged indefinitely. "There are no 
deadlines, but they cannot be prolonged indefinitely, as 
happened with the transfer of personal incomes tax," he said. 
He also made it clear in a relaxed tone that what he is 
demanding as autonomous powers for Catalonia is also valid for 
other autonomous communities. 
<H5>  "Now We Will See" </H5>
  The Generalitat premier said that he did not demand replies 
from Gonzalez. He confined himself to informing him of his 
proposal for the development of autonomy and on that basis 
issued the challenge: "Now we will see." 
  He only altered the moderate tone of his statements when he 
answered a question about the reasons the autonomy process is 
again at a crossroads by saying that "the Socialist government's 
policy has been very reductionist and restrictive." 
  But Pujol tried to leave a trail of relaxation on his 
passage 
through Madrid, both during his meeting with Felipe Gonzalez and 
at his appearance before the news media. For instance, he 
played down the Generalitat Premier's Office document demanding 
an agreement with the throne and precedence in protocol for the 
Catalan premier over the central government's prime minister. 
  Pujol, after stating that he does not accept the document as 
a whole, nor does he feel "guilty" about it, said that "the 
Generalitat has never demanded an agreement with the throne." 
With respect to protocol, he acknowledged that the Generalitat 
proposed a modest reform in 1983 or 1984. "We wished to place 
the Generalitat premier higher up, but never ahead of the prime 
minister." In short, he said that the document was one of so 
many ordered by the Generalitat in order to reflect. "We are 
doing this in order to emerge from the circle of those of us 
walking around Los Naranjos courtyard, reflecting and 
reflecting." 
  The Generalitat premier tried to counter the impression that 
Catalonia has won many advantages for its parliamentary support 
for the Socialist government. He insisted that the only demands 
met were the transfer of 15 percent of personal income tax, as 
well as some economic measures for enterprises, from which 
"other communities have also benefited." Pujol also tried to 
relax the atmosphere by stressing that his conversation with 
Felipe Gonzalez turned more on the issue of the economy than 
that of autonomy. 
<H5>  Five Points </H5>
  Pujol tried to explain that the development of autonomy was 
only one of five items at the meeting. The other four were the 
European situation, the economic situation, the social and labor 
situation, and structural problems of the economy. 
  In the economic field, Pujol revealed that Gonzalez forecast 
an improvement for this year. Both in this issue and in the 
European issue, the Generalitat premier showed his agreement 
with the stances set out by Gonzalez. 
  In an effort at relaxation, Jordi Pujol even denied that he 
raised with the prime minister the thorny issue of the 
Generalitat's and the autonomous communities' representation in 
the EC. He disagreed more in the case of social and labor 
matters. "The government should have gone further in the reform 
of the labor market. It must be made more flexible," he said.

<F P=106> [Anabel Diez and Luis R. Aizpeolea report: "Alfonso Guerra </F>
Will Agree To Stay on New Socialist Executive Committee Only If 
It Is `Balanced'"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
Deputy Secretary General Alfonso Guerra yesterday laid down his 
ideological territory, his rules of the game, and the conditions 
for peace in the PSOE. He will not agree to sit on an Executive 
Committee which is not "balanced," and which, on the contrary, 
is exclusive. Alfonso Guerra trusts that at the 33d congress in 
March there will be talk not only of seats but also of the 
political and ideological substance characteristic of a social 
democratic party. Guerra claimed for himself and his supporters 
"a certain degree of nonconformism, utopianism, and a zeal to 
transform society." 
  The PSOE number two stated that there is no Guerraism but 
rather a left wing, estimated at 40 percent of the party, which 
he represents. He conceded to the renewalists, "with a more 
social liberal stance," another 40 percent, and, last, another 
20 percent who opt "for an intermediate stance." However, the 
deputy secretary general mentioned another small group, which he 
also called renewalist, whose aim is solely to "kill Guerra." 
  Renewalists and Guerraists were awaiting Guerra's appearance 
on "The Radio 1 Breakfasts" with anticipation yesterday, in view 
of his silence over the past three months. Secretary General 
Felipe Gonzalez made a move by stating last month that he is 
counting on Guerra for the party's deputy secretary generalship. 
Many renewalists have insistently called for a response by 
Guerra. The renewalists have received Guerra's political line 
with satisfaction because of its "constructive" nature, since it 
currently seems that the idea of integration must prevail in 
view of the prospect of the abyss opening up for the Socialists 
if they head for open confrontation. 
  Nevertheless, various renewalists expressed their 
disagreement in the Congress [of Deputies] yesterday with one of 
the fundamental aspects of Guerra's line, which is to seize the 
banner of the PSOE left wing. For their part, the Guerraists 
received their leader's appearance with satisfaction, in view of 
their conviction that he would be moderate and conciliatory. 
  The fact is that Guerra dealt fully in his well-considered 
replies with all the questions which have remained open for 
months. Everybody was wondering whether Guerra would wish to be 
on an Executive Committee in which his stances would be 
glaringly in a minority. "The leadership which emerges from the 
next congress should be balanced, without excluding anybody, 
and, if it were not so, I would not wish to be in it." He then 
developed somewhat further his idea for the new Executive 
Committee. "Balanced means that the party feels satisfied, that 
there is no frustration, that society perceives that there are 
no fanatics or people who wish to divide." 
  Guerra set further terms for feeling part of the Executive 
Committee which will emerge from the next congress, which have 
to do with the course of that Socialist assembly. "The 
important thing is what will happen at the congress; whether or 
not a program with a desire for transformation emerges; whether 
it has some degree of nonconformity; whether it has some degree 
of utopianism, which is not madness but a premature truth, a 
search for the improvement of society." Guerra wants solutions 
or indications of disagreement with the situations of injustice 
which Spain still experiences to emerge from the congress, and 
he expatiated on the weakest sections of society. This does not 
mean that Guerra rejects the task of the government of which he 
was deputy prime minister for 10 years, since, in his opinion, 
that decade's work "was impressive." 
  He did make it clear for the first time that a left wing 
which he represents has taken shape in his party, since he 
rejects the term "Guerraist" because he does not feel that he is 
a distributor of membership cards bearing that name. 
  Although, in terms of the percentage of delegates to the 
congress, the Guerraists have won just over 30 percent, Guerra 
asserted that, in terms of the number of votes, they total 40 
percent. He did not neglect to mention that through the 
allocation system the minority obtains 25 percent, even if there 
is only one vote between it and the majority. Guerra specified 
that he was not the inventor of this allocation system, and even 
declared himself opposed to it. 
  Alfonso Guerra did not forget to mention those who have been 
calling for him to speak out over the past few weeks. "I have 
kept silent because I did not wish to contribute to the tendency 
toward division, and perhaps I have upset the strategy of some 
people who were expecting an angry response; well, no, I did not 
wish to inflame matters." 
<H5>  There Are No Rifts Here </H5>
  Alfonso Guerra bore up as best he could yesterday in order 
not to give the impression of being beset. He appeared not to 
be surprised by the trickle of defections by supporters. "Those 
were no friends, and so there is no betrayal; they have simply 
removed their masks. I was already saying that those who 
praised me so highly were untrustworthy." Guerra showed signs 
of rejecting his position as a minority accustomed to holding 
"the truth" and power in the PSOE. He deemed it "crazy" to 
believe that the parliamentary group members supporting him 
could take the path of the mixed group. "Whoever says that must 
be somebody new, who does not know the PSOE's culture and 
strength." 
  Although he declined to seem to disagree with the government 
doctrine, he also did not appear enthusiastic about the current 
government policies. When speaking of the 27 January strike and 
the reform of the labor market, he tried to please everybody. 
He said the reform is absolutely necessary, although he warned 
of the need to improve working conditions: "The employers must 
accept this." 
  He did not neglect to hit out at People's Party Chairman 
Jose 
Maria Aznar, "gored," according to him, by Cantabrian premier 
Juan Hormaechea: "He will know where, but it seems to hurt him."

<F P=106> [Article signed BB: "Swiss Foreign Policy Report: No </F>
Unanimous Approval From Committee"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 9 Feb (ATS) -- The National Council's Foreign 
Policy Committee, chaired by Ernst Muehlemann [Radical 
Democratic Party, Canton of Thurgau], approved the Federal 
Council's report on Swiss foreign policy and the report on 
neutrality. However, approval was not unanimous: 17 votes to 
five. A minority requested that the report be sent back to the 
Federal Council with the article asking for European Union [EU] 
membership removed. 
  According to a press release issued on Wednesday [9 
February], the majority approved the government's global 
strategy. For domestic political reasons, however, a minority 
wanted the Federal Council to consider EU membership not as a 
goal, but as a possible solution depending on circumstances. 
  Similarly, during the discussion on neutrality it was stated 
that this traditional rule must not be considered an end in 
itself but rather a means of defending the nation's interests. 
This maxim cannot remain inflexible if external circumstances 
change. 
  As an initial success of the bilateral Swiss-EC 
negotiations, 
the committee cited the rapidly reached agreement on the rules 
of origin. The issue of what strategy to adopt in these 
negotiations was also raised. The committee expressed its 
support for the new coordinator, Secretary of State Jakob 
Kellenberger. 
<H5>  Concern Over Events in Bosnia </H5>
  In light of the situation in Bosnia, the committee expressed 
its concern at the violent attacks on the civilian population. 
The committee condemned the massacre of 5 February in Sarajevo 
and the blatant and continued violation of the Geneva 
Convention. It demanded in the strongest terms that, despite 
attempts at "ethnic cleansing," a multicultural society be 
guaranteed in Sarajevo.

Repatriation -- Arnold Koller Receives Imre Konya"; as released

  [Text] Bern, 4 Feb (ATS) -- On Friday [4 February], Federal 
Councillor Arnold Koller received Imre Konya, the new Hungarian 
minister of interior, in Bern. According to a communique issued 
by the Justice and Police Department, the meeting dealt 
primarily with the political issues of migration and domestic 
security. In addition, the ministers signed an agreement which 
settles the reciprocal acceptance of illegal immigrants staying 
in either country. 
  This bilateral agreement also lays down the transportation 
conditions for those illegal foreigners from other countries 
being repatriated by Switzerland or Hungary. This measure is 
important for the repatriation of rejected asylum-seekers. 
  The agreement is based on the principles embodied in the 
agreements signed by Hungary with neighboring countries. The 
decisive factor for repatriation is not the illegal crossing of 
the border, but the fact that the person was previously a legal 
and long-term resident of another country. 
  Imre Konya also expressed his wish to see increased 
collaboration in the fight against terrorism and organized 
crime. According to the communique, both ministers agree that 
an effective migration policy and an efficient fight against 
organized crime must come through close international 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article signed NS/CE/SH: "Production of Swiss Nuclear </F>
Reactors Stable in 1993"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 8 Feb (ATS) -- Swiss nuclear reactors produced 
22.05 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 1993, the Swiss 
Association for Atomic Energy (ASEA) announced Tuesday [8 
February]. This is the third best figure so far, after the 
record in 1990 (22.33 billion net kilowatt-hours) and the 1992 
result, which was 0.5 percent higher than that of 1993. The 
average rate of use for Swiss nuclear reactors was 85.6 percent. 
  In addition to electric current, the nuclear reactors at 
Goesgen and Beznau I and II also delivered long distance heat. 
The cardboard mill in Niedergoesgen took some 150 million kWh 
of industrial heat from the Goesgen reactor. The two Beznau 
reactors provided around 108 million kWh of thermal energy to 
the regional distance heating network in the lower Aar Valley. 
  Since the Leibstadt reactor was commissioned in 1984, total 
Swiss nuclear production has stayed above 20 billion kWh. 
Fluctuations from one year to the next are mainly the result of 
shutdowns of varying length for annual inspections. 
<H5>  Goesgen Leads The Pack </H5>
  In 1993, the Beznau I reactor was down for 100 days. That is 
the longest stoppage for this reactor since it was commissioned. 
The two steam generators were changed and the Nano emergency 
system was put into place. 
  Goesgen recorded the highest net production of all Swiss 
nuclear reactors, with 7,408.130 million kWh and a 90.5 percent 
rate of use. It was followed by Leibstadt (7,338.055 million 
kWh). Beznau I produced 2,156.305 million kWh, which was less 
than the 2,650.931 million produced by Beznau II and the 
2,568.475 million produced by Muehleberg.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Annette </F>
Schmidt on 21 February, place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Schmidt] How do you assess the current situation? 
  [Kinkel] I think we are all pleased that it was not 
necessary 
to carry out air strikes in and around Sarajevo. Now it will be 
important to finally stabilize the situation in and around 
Sarajevo. It will be important to make sure that a cease-fire is 
achieved also in the other parts of former Yugoslavia if at all 
possible. We must not forget that Sarajevo is only a very very 
small part and only a beginning on an important path. It will 
now be important to make use of the political momentum and 
achieve a political solution. The chances for this have now 
become a little bit better. 
  [Schmidt] NATO Secretary General Woerner has said that the 
success is above all due to determined action by NATO. Was the 
ultimatum the decisive point? 
  [Kinkel] I believe the ultimatum was a very, very important 
measure. I personally believe that without the ultimatum the 
Serb side would not have been prepared to accept the Russian 
proposal. Several factors had an impact; the involvement of the 
Russians who were able to influence the Serbs in a way that 
resulted in their willingness to withdraw was very important. 
There were also certain diplomatic efforts by the German side, 
by the Chancellor and myself. Now let's wait and see how things 
go. I think at the moment there is not yet any reason for joy 
and euphoria. Again: only a first small step, albeit an 
important one, has been achieved. 
  [Schmidt] If we look at the ultimatum, after eight days, it 
lasted ten, there was still no movement yet. At the end of the 
day the breakthrough came with the Russian initiative from 
Moscow, Yeltsin's letter to Karadzic and the deployment of 400 
Russian soldiers in the Sarajevo region. How should we see the 
Russians and Russian diplomacy in this situation? Was this 
eventually the decisive point and what consequences has this in 
the context of the NATO initiative Partnership for Peace for the 
states of East and Central Europe? After all Russia had been in 
danger of becoming isolated on the international scene? 
  [Kinkel] If I can start at the end, the NATO summit with its 
Partnership for Peace also contained a fundamental offer to 
Russia for it to move closer to NATO. Partnership for Peace is 
not just an offer to the countries undergoing radical change in 
Central and East Europe, but basically also to Russia and 
Ukraine, although we must differentiate here between de jure and 
de facto possibilities. 
  It is the case that this Russian participation has shown we 
certainly cannot achieve peace in the region, in former 
Yugoslavia, without Russia. This is also quite simply linked to 
the fact that individual countries have their own relationship 
with the warring parties -- just think of our relations with the 
Croats and our relations with the Muslims -- and the good 
relations between the Russians and Serbs have helped here. But, 
I repeat, a number of factors have come together here. 
  [Schmidt] In this regard, and you mentioned it yourself 
earlier, what about the possibility of Germany taking on the 
role of mediator -- there was a conversation between the 
chancellor and Boris Yeltsin on Friday and your efforts, your 
frequent talks with Foreign Minister Kozyrev. How important are 
Germany's role and Germany's relations with the Croats which you 
mentioned in this regard? 
  [Kinkel] I do not think that we can talk about taking on the 
role of mediator, but only about mediatory efforts. If I am 
right this is a little less than the role of mediator. It is 
also true that so far we have not been passive toward the whole 
conflict. French Foreign Minister Juppe and I initiated and 
pursued the European plan of action. We have shown very great 
commitment to the humanitarian effort. After the United States, 
we are probably the country that has given the most in financial 
support. Germany has taken in most of the refugees from former 
Yugoslavia and we will be asked by the others the day after 
tomorrow, sorry tomorrow, at the conference of political leaders 
to take another step toward granting more aid. I do not know 
where this will lead at the moment, but I think it is very 
important that these talks are taking place in Germany. 
  [Schmidt] On what initiative is this conference of political 
leaders based? What will it discuss mainly and is it perhaps 
actually a preliminary stage for the summit meeting of heads of 
government which has been discussed so often? 
  [Kinkel] It was my idea during our troika meeting in Athens 
with Kozyrev last Friday. I consulted the chancellor about 
this, and then we both made a lot of phone calls. Let's wait 
and see. I do not want to be euphoric here either, rather I 
want to see what comes of these talks tomorrow. Further 
meetings, for example between foreign ministers, could follow, 
but this is not yet definite. 
  [Schmidt] If you look at the influence you have, the 
relations with the Croats, but on the other hand there is 
criticism from Bonn, from the Bosnian ambassador, that all this 
was a tactical exercise and generally the West attached too much 
significance to it. How do you assess this, that the Bosnians 
are rather sceptical about the developments of the last few 
hours. 
  [Kinkel] It is certainly true that the Serbs have 
frequently led us up the garden path before. I have always said 
that words must be followed by actions. However, this time a 
concrete result was actually achieved, therefore I think the 
ambassador's assessment is not quite correct. Now further steps 
must be taken. Above all we must try to bring the Croats and 
the Bosnian Muslims, who have drifted quite far apart, closer 
together. 
  We now also have a much, much stronger commitment by the 
Americans than before. In about the last fortnight the 
Americans have joined in a very committed way the efforts to 
find a political solution. I think this is very important 
because later it will be necessary to implement a peace plan in 
practice. For this soldiers are needed, many soldiers, UN 
soldiers. Without the help of the Americans this would not be 
possible. Incidentally, we also need them because of their 
influence on the Bosnian Muslims. 
  [Schmidt] So is it also true that Bill Clinton's 
determination was decisive? 
  [Kinkel] Yes, one can say that, Clinton has certainly made a 
decisive contribution with his more resolute action, with the 
resolute willingness to join in. 
  [Schmidt] To come back to the meetings here on German soil 
of 
the Croats and the Muslims, for the second time, in Frankfurt at 
the weekend. Maybe in Frankfurt also for reasons of location, 
because it is maybe easier to get to for both sides, but why 
Germany? So little of the [contents of these] talks gets out. 
It is only announced that there is a new plan to divide 
Bosnia-Herzegovina into seven cantons, that is not really all 
that new. Is it a good sign that so little becomes known about 
the talks or is it rather a sign that there is no progress? 
  [Kinkel] For me this is a good sign. You know that Tudjman 
and Izetbegovic wanted to meet of their own accord at the 
Petersberg [government guest house in Bonn] a few weeks ago. 
You know that the meeting between the Croats and the Muslims in 
Frankfurt took place at their request. Germany has good 
relations with both parties to the conflict and, I'll say it 
again, we offer our mediatory services. To be a little more 
modest, I do not want to speak of a mediator role. 
  For me this conference of [political] directors tomorrow is 
very important because I can imagine that it will be a 
preliminary stage, a step that will continue the peace process. 
We still have a very, very long way ahead of us. Even more so 
because it appears at the moment that some of the Serb weapons 
may resurface in Tuzla, Bihac, and at other places. We will 
have to decide how we will react now, but the momentum that the 
overall process has gained because of the NATO threats, the 
Russian involvement, our mediatory efforts, the help of the 
Americans, we must use this momentum. 
  However, again, I personally and we have been disappointed 
too often in the past. I warn against assuming that we already 
have the solution in our pocket. That would be too good. 
  [Schmidt] What will you be doing yourself today? You will be 
having meetings in Bonn. Will you be travelling to Brussels to 
the foreign ministers' meeting? 
  [Kinkel] No, I will not be going to Brussels today. Ms. 
Seiler-Albring will be there. The talks which had to be held 
took place in the last few days. I had a long talk yesterday 
with Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN's envoy, and with various 
other foreign ministers. The telephone and other technical aids 
can be used to communicate with each other to such an extent 
that it is not so necessary to meet in the same place. We 
European foreign ministers meet virtually every week and we are 
almost in daily contact with the U.S. secretary of state. 
  [Schmidt] What about your plans for this week? 
  [Kinkel] First, we shall wait and see what happens at the 
talks tomorrow. The other countries -- all the important ones 
will be there -- will wait and see too. They will evaluate the 
situation and consider what should be done next. Redman, the 
U.S. special envoy, is here in Europe and he will be there [at 
the conference of political directors] tomorrow too, as will Mr. 
Churkin who negotiated the action to be taken by the Serbs on 
behalf of the Russians. All the critical people will be here 
and let's see how we get on. I do not want to raise any false 
hopes here either.

<F P=106> [By Christophe Beaudufe] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, Feb 21 (AFP) -- European and U.S. experts on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, boosted by the success of the NATO ultimatum 
against the Bosnian Serbs, meet here on Tuesday [22 February] 
with their Russian counterparts to build on the momentum gained 
to seek a political solution to the conflict there. 
  Within two hours of the expiry of the ultimatum, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton declared: "The NATO decision and its 
results provide new potential for progress toward an end to the 
tragic conflict in Bosnia." 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel added here: "We should 
make use of this fortunate moment to ensure that this first test 
will be transformed into a global solution." 
  The Bonn meeting will bring together foreign ministry 
representatives from Germany, France, Britain, Belgium, Greece, 
Russia and the United States. The U.S. delegation will be 
headed by Clinton's special envoy for Bosnia, Charles Redman, 
who has stepped up contacts with the warring sides in the past 
week. 
  The meeting is being held at Russia's request and reflects 
Russia's return to the stage of international diplomacy 
alongside the major powers, diplomatic sources here said. 
  They pointed out the emergence of a new rivalry between the 
Russians and the Americans, now directly involved in the Bosnian 
crisis. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called last 
Friday for a meeting along the lines of the one to be held in 
Bonn. 
  The U.S. State Department greeted the proposal with extreme 
caution. 
  Diplomats will be charged with smoothing out the differences 
of view that have appeared in the past few days. The West, 
particularly the Europeans, are set on promoting a negotiated 
solution, come what may, on the basis of the European plan which 
envisages Bosnia being partitioned into three mini-states, and 
do not intend to allow themselves to be deflected by Moscow. 
  But Russia, which has said it is ready to send 400 more 
paratroops into Sarajevo in the framework of the UN operation, 
in addition to the 400 already sent, could make its influence 
felt on the content of the negotiations because of its influence 
over the Bosnian Serbs. 
  With the shifting of the focus for negotiations to Germany, 
Bonn will be able to play a stronger mediating role. "The goal 
for we Germans has been above all to include Russia" in the 
negotiating process, Kinkel emphasised Monday. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl made several telephone calls to 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin before the NATO ultimatum 
expired at 0000 GMT Monday with the objective of persuading 
Yeltsin to accept NATO's decision. He also spoke of organising 
an international conference on Bosnia, for which the Bonn 
meeting could do the groundwork. 
  The Germans hosted a Croat-Bosnian summit in early January 
and have good relations with both non-Serb parties to the 
conflict. They have been working behind the scenes to facilitate 
a rapprochement, "essential for a political solution" of the 
conflict, according to Kinkel. 
  On Saturday Croat and Moslem Bosnian negotiators met in 
Frankfurt and announced that their positions had drawn closer 
after a day of talks on putting relations on a "lasting basis." 
  In the Netherlands, Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans 
supported the idea of applying a NATO ultimatum to Tuzla and 
Srebrenica, but said "I think it would be very desirable if a 
decision of this kind could also be taken with regard to Mostar." 
  He said the situation in government-held eastern Mostar was 
"very serious and an ultimatum could also have a positive effect 
there." 
  Koojimans, interviewed on Dutch radio from Hilversum, said 
he 
thought it was "too early today to speak of a decisive turning 
point towards peace." 
  "We have seen too often what we thought we had achieved 
collapse and as long as shots are heard, we should maintain the 
ultimatum in force." 
  "We should also be certain that all heavy weaponry has 
really 
been withdrawn," he added.

  [Text] Bonn, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Talks between top U.S., West 
European and Russian foreign affairs officials on the situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina were opening near here Tuesday [22 
February] in a bid to build on the current calm around Sarajevo. 
  Both U.S. special envoy for Yugoslavia Charles Redman and 
his 
Russian counterpart Vitaly Churkin are attending the talks in 
which the 12 European Community states, Canada and UN officials 
are also represented. 
  The talks, in a hotel at Bad Godesberg, come as Russia is 
proposing an international conference to try to settle the 
situation in former Yugoslavia. 
  Moscow's return to the world diplomatic front line on the 
issue coincides with the despatch of Russian troops to Sarajevo 
to join in UN demilitarisation efforts following the withdrawal 
of Serb artillery under threats from NATO. 
  Germany has also been closely associated with latest Bosnian 
peace efforts. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl who has been in close telephone touch 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin on the Bosnian crisis, Monday backed the proposal of a 
"high-level" international conference. 
  Yeltsin said Monday that the main three themes of the talks 
would be the situation in Sarajevo, other intended zones of 
security in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a peace plan. 
  French President Francois Mitterrand said Monday he was 
calling on the UN Security Council to put Sarajevo under UN 
administration.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
Asiem el Difraoui; place and date not given: "Finger on the 
Trigger"] 
  [Text] [Difraoui] Mr. Secretary General, what is your 
view on NATO's Bosnia ultimatum? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Of course, we welcome the decision of 9 
February. In fact, the United Nations acted as a kind of 
catalyst with its letter to Manfred Woerner. We confronted NATO 
with its responsibility and thus contributed to their new 
determined position. 
  [Difraoui] Who will decide on air strikes when the ultimatum 
has expired: NATO or the United Nations? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] First of all, we hope it will not get that 
far and negotiations will lead to heavy weapons being handed 
over to the blue helmets before the ultimatum expires. The 
United Nations and NATO are cooperating closely. Who will give 
the "all clear" for possible air strikes has not been determined. 
  [Difraoui] If you are allowed to do so, will you start air 
strikes? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I would not hesitate one moment to enforce 
the Security Council's decisions by means of air strikes. If 
NATO gives me a mandate, I can act immediately because I already 
have a UN mandate. 
  [Difraoui] Could air strikes fail because of Russian 
opposition? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Certain members of the Security Council, such 
as the Russian Federation, have their own interpretation of 
certain security resolutions, as far as the difference between 
air support and air strikes is concerned. They consider these 
two things as completely separate. But at the moment, the 
Russian Federation shares the same aims as the United States, 
the European Union [EU], and the United Nations, and it plays an 
active role in the Geneva talks. 
  [Difraoui] Would not a lifting of sanctions have been more 
effective than the threat of air strikes? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Lifting the embargo is a decision that the 
Security Council has to take. So far, the Security Council has 
rejected doing this. 
  [Difraoui] In your capacity as Secretary General -- are you 
tending toward lifting the embargo? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] My position has various nuances. I will 
follow the Security Council's decision. I think that the 
Security Council has to accept responsibility for such a 
decision. 
  [Difraoui] In view of the continuing massacres, there are 
numerous voices in the world that advocate a tougher approach.... 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I can understand the worldwide feeling of 
dismay. I am suffering as well, I am alarmed by the massacres, 
the genocide, the rapes. I am shocked. Nevertheless, public 
emotions have to be restrained in order to be able to go on 
negotiating. 
  [Difraoui] Has the United Nations been able to determine yet 
who is to blame for the massacre in the Sarajevo market? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, we are still investigating. 
Paradoxically, these investigations are very difficult because 
there was only one shell involved and not several. If there are 
more than one explosion, it is easier to determine where the 
shells come from. 
  [Difraoui] In your opinion, who is mainly responsible for 
the continuation of the war? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] This is a difficult question. We are all 
responsible, of course there are the warring parties, but also 
those who did not want to intervene. As far back as last May, 
the Security Council demanded 8,000 blue helmets for Bosnia. We 
(the General Secretariat) asked for 30,000 troops. So far, we 
have not even gotten the 8,000. Of course, the continuation of 
the war is mainly the fault of the warring parties, who are 
sisters and brothers really -- but it is also the fault of the 
international community. It does not make the necessary efforts 
to find a solution. There are not enough funds being made 
available. 
  [Difraoui] Several UN generals in former Yugoslavia, such as 
Francis Briquemont and Jean Cot, criticized exactly that. They 
blamed the United Nations for not providing enough troops -- and 
this is why they had to go. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I can understand their standpoint. But the 
United Nations does not have any troops of its own. It is the 
member states that supply the United Nations with troops. We 
kept asking, we sent letters to dozens of countries. We did not 
get anything. It is, therefore, not our fault. The United 
Nations has fulfilled its task and has established contact with 
the member states, but it did not get a single soldier.... 
  [Difraoui] Is this not a situation where everybody is 
blaming everybody else -- the United Nations is blaming the 
member countries, and the member countries are blaming the 
United Nations? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, I do not think so. We have always 
demanded troops and additional material to carry out our task 
properly. We need a maximum number of troops in order to 
achieve maximum results. But still, we will not blame the 
countries that have not sent any troops. There are 124 member 
countries, and you cannot blame them all -- but the United 
Nations is being blamed. 
  [Difraoui] Where did the United Nations make mistakes? 
Where are you blaming yourself? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The only thing for which we can blame 
ourselves is that we have not managed to convince the member 
states of the necessity of having more troops there. That we 
have not managed to convince them to pay their contributions. 
We are in a bad financial crisis -- $1 billion are outstanding. 
  [Difraoui] Is this not also due to mismanagement and 
corruption within the UN administration? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Various newspapers keep reporting gigantic 
failures within our administration. This is an exaggeration. I 
have nominated an inspector to fight corruption; as soon as 
problems become obvious, sanctions will be taken. On the 
subject of mismanagement: One has to remember that with the 
same administration, the same number of people, we are no longer 
carrying out three, but 17 international peacekeeping missions. 
We have not taken on one single additional person. We have 
troops in Burundi, Rwanda, observers in South Africa, soldiers 
in Cambodia, Somalia, a military presence in the Spanish Sahara, 
in El Salvador.... The fact that we manage to do all this 
speaks for itself. Cambodia was a particular success. The 
United Nations managed to create stable conditions for free and 
fair elections. Yasushi Akashi, the United Nations' special 
envoy in Cambodia is now in charge for former Yugoslavia. 
  [Difraoui] Does this mean you feel unfairly treated by 
world opinion? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] To put it simply, public opinion looks for a 
scapegoat and blames the United Nations. I would not say that 
we do not make any mistakes. But the mistakes arise from our 
being inundated with work. At the same time, we do not have 
either the military or the logistic means to carry out 22 
operations. This is our weakness. We have the funds for three, 
four missions, but not for 22. 
  [Difraoui] After a long debate, Germany is now finally 
deploying blue helmets -- not for military missions, but for 
humanitarian and logistical support. Should the Federal 
Republic not provide combat forces? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No!!! -- What counts for me is that Germany 
takes part in UN activities at all. It is up to the individual 
member country to choose which field it is most interested in. 
Peacekeeping missions are only 30 percent of all UN missions; 
70 percent are environmental measures, economic and social 
cooperation, development aid, etc. There is a lot to be done 
every week. 
  [Difraoui] This means there will be no Bundeswehr bombers 
over former Yugoslavia? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Our policy is that every country can decide 
itself what it wants to offer. We accept anything. One state 
could say: We are prepared to send aircraft, another one sends a 
hospital. A third: We are going to send troops, but only under 
the condition that they do not fight. 
  [Difraoui] If you had the opportunity to do so, how would 
you change the composition of the Security Council, which goes 
back to the times of the Cold War? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I would not make any suggestions, but I would 
think practically: Who pays, who sends people.... 
  [Difraoui] Germany pays almost one-twelfth of the 
contributions. Would not Germany have the right, if not to a 
seat on the Security Council, at least to house some of the 
important UN organizations? The United Nations promised this 
indirectly on several occasions? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, I was in Bonn for this reason, and we 
will transfer several UN organizations there. But I would also 
like to say that it is more important to have many German 
engineers within UN organizations worldwide than to have the 
headquarters of these organizations in Germany. 
  [Difraoui] But if the Germans would like to have more of the 
United Nations in their country.... 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We have achieved this. During the next few 
months we will transfer a division of the UNDP, that is the UN 
development aid program, to Bonn. 
  [Difraoui] But this is not an important organization.... 
  [Butrus-Ghali] You have to start making small steps. 
  [Difraoui] Do you intend moving a human rights organization 
to Germany in the future? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We can talk about that when such an 
organization is established.... I will come to Bonn during the 
next few months. I would like the Germans to take an even more 
active part in UN activities. I am counting on Germany's role 
in the world to strengthen the United Nations' role. As I said 
before, this does not only mean peacekeeping missions, this is 
just one activity. There is a summit on social development going 
on in Copenhagen; there will be a summit on overpopulation in 
Cairo next year; in 1995 Beijing will host a summit on women. 
These are examples for important contributions and 
technological help of a country like Germany.... 
  [Difraoui] Are you content with the situation in Somalia? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] After the withdrawal of the Belgian, French, 
U.S., and German troops we are trying to do our best, replacing 
them with African and Asian units. 
  [Difraoui] Is this not a failure? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No. Of course, we have not been successful 
in the south of Mogadishu. But in the entire rest of the 
country, and this is 95 percent, we were successful. We have 
established local police forces, local councils, hospitals, 
orphanages, etc.; food supply is safeguarded, children no longer 
die of hunger.... These are very positive things. 
  [Difraoui] The only peace talks that brought about concrete 
results last year were those between Israel and the PLO. The 
United Nations did not have a share in these -- is this not 
typical? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, there is no text of the United Nations 
that says that the United Nations holds a monopoly on conflict 
solving. On the contrary, I would be very pleased if the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict were solved tomorrow outside the 
framework of the United Nations. I would also be content if the 
conflicts in Burundi or Rwanda were solved by the Organization 
of African Unity. As I said, I am overburdened. I do not have 
the means to care for 22 sick persons, if I have only beds for 
three or four available. If anybody else wants to solve a 
conflict, I am the first person who will be pleased about it. 
  [Difraoui] During the Gulf war the idea of a new world order 
was emphasized. Was this not a big illusion? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I have never said that there is a world 
order, not to speak of a new one. The only thing I said was 
that a new world order must be established -- and that the 
United Nations can help develop it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian UN commander Sir Michael Rose by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "We Will Reply 
With the Use of Force"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Have NATO air strikes become 
superfluous as a result of the Serbian compromise? 
  [Rose] I am optimistic that air strikes will not be 
necessary. The cease-fire is largely being observed. The UN 
troops were allowed to position themselves between the front 
lines. We believe that all weapons will be under our control 
before the ultimatum ends. Then a commission will regulate 
details so that life can normalize again in Sarajevo. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this make the NATO ultimatum superfluous? 
  [Rose] If you draw a line around Sarajevo, there are three 
warring parties. If one of them interrupts the peace process -- 
for whatever reasons -- it risks an air strike. Yet, our main 
task in Bosnia is to supply the civilian population with food. 
This will be very difficult if we drop bombs. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you serious? Your main task is probably 
to end the siege of Sarajevo and to protect the town against the 
Serbian conquerors. 
  [Rose] Without the blue helmets, numerous people probably 
would have died of starvation. In addition, we have to 
participate in the creation of security zones. NATO will 
support us here. Life in Sarajevo must be normalized, so people 
can live here like in Bonn or Berlin. It must be possible for 
people to leave the town any time. This is what I understand by 
normal life. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is Sarajevo's pacification the beginning of a 
political solution for the other Muslim enclaves? What will 
happen to Mostar, which is encircled by the Croats? 
  [Rose] If the peace process in Sarajevo is successful, 
effects will also be noticeable in other areas. The Muslim 
eastern part of the town is a top priority. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Serbian Army is withdrawing the major part 
of its artillery. The rest will remain under UN control within 
a 20-km radius around Sarajevo. Why? 
  [Rose] I have no idea why they are doing that. The Serbs 
probably consider it important to leave some weapons there. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] To be able to use them quickly during the next 
offensive by the Bosnian Army. 
  [Rose] This may be the reason. Yet, in my view, the UN 
control mechanism works as follows: The side that wants to have 
the weapons back must use force, and we will reply with force. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this mean that for months NATO will be on 
constant alert concerning Bosnia? 
  [Rose] This may be the case. However, NATO has been present 
in the Bosnian air space since last April. It will remain there 
until the peace process is completed. It does not make any 
difference to the pilots. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Muslim fighters in Sarajevo are urgently 
waiting to take advantage of the situation and to recapture 
positions they have lost. Would you also intervene against the 
Bosnian-Muslim Army? 
  [Rose] We are between the warring parties. Thus, the 
Bosnian Army would have to attack us first. We are entitled to 
defend ourselves. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Every air strike must be requested by you. 
Would it be possible for NATO to strike Serbian positions 
without consulting you? 
  [Rose] Naturally it can happen that NATO combat planes are 
forced to strike back in self-defense if they are attacked from 
the ground. In that case, NATO will not consult anybody. 
However, if NATO attacks ground troops, I will be involved in 
the decisionmaking process because I am the local commander. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The problem is that, after the unsuccessful 
talks of the past few months, nobody really believes the Serbian 
war machinery can be stopped in the long run without air strikes. 
  [Rose] The Serbs promised the fulfillment of all conditions 
mentioned in the Geneva peace plan before the ultimatum was 
adopted. With its threat, the NATO ultimatum efficiently 
supported this process. I am confident: If a get into a car, I 
do not expect it to give up the ghost. If it happens, I will 
react. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So far the West has rejected the use of force 
vis-a-vis the Serbs, claiming the war might spread to the whole 
Balkans in that case. Do you see this danger? 
  [Rose] I examine every problem separately. Ending the siege 
of Sarajevo is one thing. Of course, other risks continue to 
exist. Yet, my instinct tells me the war will not spread.

NATO spokesman said during a summit of the defense ministers of 
France, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,

  The ultimatum still stands. NATO's position has not changed

  [Text] Naples, Italy, Feb 21 (AFP) -- The NATO ultimatum to 
withdraw all heavy weapons from a 20 kilometre (12.5 mile) 
exclusion zone around Sarajevo is still in force and weapons 
found within the zone will be subject to air strikes, the NATO 
commander for southern Europe said Monday [21 February]. 
  "Our mission is not over," Admiral Jeremy Boorda said. "Any 
weapons found that are not under control will be subject to air 
strike. Any shelling of Sarajevo will be cause for a strike 
recommendation against the party doing the shelling," he also 
said. 
  Meanwhile verification by UN forces on the ground and NATO 
reconnaissance aircraft continued Monday, the admiral said. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said all heavy 
weapons 
had to be withdrawn 20 kilometres (12.5 mile) from the center of 
Sarajevo or placed under UN control.

  [Text] NATO defence ministers said today that the deadline 
for Serbs to withdraw their big guns from around Sarajevo by 
midnight remained firm -- but they hoped air strikes would not 
be needed. 
  Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind joined ministers from the 
United States, France, Italy and Holland in issuing a statement 
after meeting at Aviano air base in northeast Italy to assess 
the situation in Sarajevo. They also heard air strike 
contigency plans from NATO commanders. 
  The ministers were told that snow would prevent the Bosnian 
Serbs from meeting the deadline in full. And Mr Rifkind said it 
would take time to establish whether there had been compliance, 
probably after the deadline. "It will not be possible to come 
to the conclusion until after midnight," he said. "It will up 
to those on the ground to advise as soon after midnight as is 
physically possible as to whether they are satisfied compliance 
has occurred or not occurred." 
  Their statement said: "It is the hope of the ministers that 
the terms set by the NAC (North Atlantic Council) will be met 
and that no air strikes will be necessary. However, they are 
determined to support actions to end the slaughter of innocent 
civilians in Sarajevo and to reinvigorate the peace 
negotiations." 
  The statement said the ministers were confident that NATO 
forces were "ready and able to carry out their mission" in 
coordination with the UN "should that be necessary." 
  In Sarajevo, meanwhile, a senior UN officer said the Serbs 
had withdrawn their guns to the extent that they could no longer 
capture the city. And the UN commander in Bosnia, 
Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, was optimistic that all the 
artillery would be removed from the exclusion zone or be under 
UN control by the deadline. 
  Later today, Mr Rifkind was expected to fly on to Gioia del 
Colle from where British strike aircraft would be deployed if UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali were to give the go-ahead 
to bomb. 
  Meanwhile, a unit of 60 British soldiers -- men of the 1st 
and 3rd Royal Horse Artillery -- was today preparing to take up 
positions in Sarajevo with their five Cymbeline radars, 
sophisticated equipment which can pinpoint artillery and missile 
launch sites to within 10 yards. 
  Major Peter Wright, 32, regiment spokesman, said: "They are 
good troops, well trained. They have really put their backs 
into getting ready. The spirit is very good and they're all 
raring to go. They're delighted to be going out. The situation 
out there is likely to be quite confused, judging by news 
leaking back."

  [Text] During successive meetings today with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and later with German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Maximos Palace, Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou discussed the latest developments in 
the Bosnian issue and in Skopje following the Greek Government 
decision. 
  Russia's relations with the European Union [EU], the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and generally in the former Yugoslavia, 
and the problems between Athens and Skopje were discussed today 
at Zappion Palace during the talks between the EU troika and 
Russia. The talks were attended by Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias, German Foreign Minister Kinkel, Belgian 
Foreign Minister Willy Claes, Hans van den Broek, EU 
Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and Russian Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev. Regarding this meeting, our diplomatic correspondent 
Mirella Kalostipi reports the following: 
  [Begin Kalostipi recording] Foreign Minister Papoulias 
described the meeting between the EU troika and Russia as 
productive, sincere, and warm. Since this morning, the foreign 
ministers of Germany and Belgium, the EU commissioner for 
foreign affairs, and the Greek foreign minister, who is 
presiding over the EU Council of Foreign Ministers, have been 
meeting with the Russian foreign minister on all the important 
issues that Europe is facing. Naturally, the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was at the center of the talks. Both 
Papoulias and Kozyrev expressed optimism that a peaceful 
solution to the problem will prevail over a military one. 
  In a news conference immediately following the meeting, the 
foreign ministers of Germany and Russia were asked about the 
Greek measures against Skopje. Kinkel, as is known, opposed the 
measures, saying they are unusual and not a way to solve 
problems. He also expressed his country's interest in stability 
in the area. The Russian foreign minister stressed that the 
people in the south of Europe should contribute toward stability 
in the Balkans. If there are states with territorial plans 
against other countries, they should give them up and, like 
Russia, Kozyrev said, respect the sovereignty and independence 
of other peoples. [end recording]

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 21 (AFP) -- The European Commission 
believes that Greece's economic blockade of Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] violates European 
laws on free trade with a third state, a spokesman for the 
Commission said here Monday [21 February]. 
  "Greece's decisions clearly violate the trade laws" of the 
European Community, he said, adding that the EC Commission is 
waiting for Greece to justify its action as called for by the 
law. 
  According to EC law, any country that imposes such sanctions 
must prove that it was forced to undertake such a move because 
its security was threatened. 
  In the northwestern Greek town of Ioannina on Monday, Greek 
Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias issued a message to his EC 
partners saying that "it is not Greece that has hurt the EC's 
solidarity but rather those who have supported (FYROM's) 
intransigence." 
  Greece, which holds the rotating presidency of the EC, said 
it had been forced to impose the punitive blockade last week 
after the United States "erroneously" recognised FYROM before 
the latter had responded positively to Greece's demands for 
Skopje to work towards stability in the region. 
  Most of Athens' EC partners have also recognized FYROM. 
  Greece accuses FYROM of usurping a name which Athens says is 
solely part of Greek heritage and of harbouring expansionist 
ambitions over the Greek province of the same name. 
  "We are not asking anything from anyone, the only thing we 
want is respect for our borders, respect for the rights of the 
Greek minority (in FYROM) and respect for our history," 
Papoulias said. 
  Along the Greek-FYROM border Monday, convoys of trucks could 
be seen waiting for Greek border guards to check their 
merchandise before being allowed to proceed. 
  The Greek blockade covers oil and other essential supplies.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 22 (AFP) -- EC ministers debating 
plans to admit four states to the European Community reached a 
partial accord on agricultural subsidies early Tuesday [22 
February], Community sources reported here. 
  European affairs ministers agreed in principle that 
long-term 
subsidies for certain troubled agricultural sectors could remain 
in place in the four candidate countries, Austria, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden. 
  The accord was to be presented later Tuesday to foreign 
ministers from the four states. 
  The ministers also accepted a proposal from the EC Executive 
Commission to consider the northern regions of the three Nordic 
states -- located above the 62nd parallel -- as agricultural 
mountain zones, a diplomatic source reported. 
  These regions, where summer lasts only several weeks, meet 
special EC criteria on reduced fertility and productivity. 
  In another move the ministers reached common ground on 
production quotas covering sugar, milk and milk products for 
each of the four candidates. 
  They accepted a proposal from Finland that will allow 
Finnish 
mink breeders to continue feeding their animals with herring, 
despite the fact that under EC regulations herring are only to 
be consumed by humans. 
  In addition Finnish legislation governing holiday residences 
reserved for Finns can be maintained as can the autonomous 
status of the Swedish-speaking island of Aaland. 
  But the ministers meeting here made virtually no progress on 
fishing questions, apart from reaching an agreement in principle 
on access to EC and Nordic waters. 
  Regional aid, the possible establishment of specific 
criteria 
for the four candidates and their budgetary contributions were 
to be debated further on Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend by ORF </F>
correspondent Horst Friedrich Mayer, Conrad Seidl of DER 
STANDARD, and Herbert Lackner of PROFIL in Vienna -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Mayer] It is Sunday, 11 o'clock. Good 
morning from our Press Hour program, Ladies and Gentlemen. Our 
guest today is Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend, and he will 
be interviewed by my colleagues Conrad Seidl of DER STANDARD and 
Herbert Lackner of PROFIL and by me. 
  Mr. Minister, with just a few hours before the Sarajevo 
ultimatum expires, the first question that naturally arises is 
what does the situation around Sarajevo -- the situation of the 
Western alliance, but also that of the United Nations -- look 
like from the Austrian viewpoint? 
  [Fasslabend] There is no doubt that the NATO ultimatum 
addressed to the Bosnian Serbs constitutes some kind of turning 
point in the international policy toward Yugoslavia. We can 
note today that part of the heavy weapons and guns have been 
withdrawn. It is impossible to say right now whether all the 
weapons will indeed be withdrawn. In any case, one gets the 
impression that the ultimatum is meant seriously. This is also 
indicated by the meeting of NATO defense ministers this 
afternoon and by the convening of the UN Security Council for 
tomorrow. 
  Things will essentially depend on whether for the first time 
the international community's determination will really be 
expressed here, which might make the warring parties give in 
and, in the long run, could lead to an end to the fighting. 
  [Mayer] Then we would have a solution for Sarajevo, but not 
for the many other Bosnian towns, which will be all the more 
embattled in the future. Their names also have been in the 
headlines for the past two years. Thus, attention is shifting 
to Sarajevo and to the solution there and away from the other 
places, where the fighting continues unabated. 
  [Fasslabend] This is certainly correct and, in my view, this 
is particularly important because a large part of the fighting 
did not take place in and around Sarajevo, but rather all over 
Bosnia. Even now, the main area of fighting is in Bihac in 
northwestern Bosnia, and it has certainly been a rather skillful 
policy of the Serbs to divert attention by one or another 
maneuvers to the capital city and, on the other hand, to conquer 
territory in other Bosnian regions, which has led to the fact 
that a large part of the goals of this war -- that is, a large 
part of the territorial gain, which is to lead to the 
establishment of Greater Serbia -- indeed has been achieved. 
  In my view, it is necessary to make it clear that the basic 
principle must hold true -- namely that an aggressor, someone 
who is trying to achieve political goals by military means, must 
not be successful. I think this is exemplary for Europe's 
entire future policy. The point is not just to prevent as much 
suffering as possible in Bosnia in the future, but the point 
certainly also is that an aggressor must not be politically 
successful with military means, because this would have 
unpredictable consequences for all of Europe and the entire 
world. 
  This would also have consequences for Austria. As a 
neighboring country, we are certainly affected to a certain 
extent by this specific security policy and, thus, also by all 
other political decisions, such as joining the European Union 
[EU]. 
  [Seidl] This conflict, however, also has shown that a small 
country -- even if it is diplomatically recognized and if all 
people say how terrible all this is -- has had to stand up to an 
aggressor for about two years before, it is said: If this and 
that does not happen, then perhaps the international community 
may intervene militarily. As the Austrian defense minister, one 
would have to draw conclusions from that and say: Our country 
would also have to wait about two years until someone comes and 
helps us. Could Austria stand up to an aggressor for two years? 
  [Fasslabend] This is certainly a very good question you have 
asked. There is no doubt it is one of the essential insights 
gained from the Bosnian conflict, the Yugoslav conflict, that 
one has to assume that, at least during the initial stage, one 
only its own defense capacity, only the security one is willing 
to provide for itself. 
  Of course, this is not the only thing. We can proceed from 
the premise that, due to the new situation as well as the 
measures we have taken, for the first time in our history, we 
can expect to be able to fulfill a large part of our tasks on 
our own in the future. 
  In addition, however, there are no doubt still many fields 
in 
which it is important that something is done at the 
international level. Our joining the European Union will be the 
most important step for Austria's security since the conclusion 
of the State Treaty in 1955. By far this will be the most 
important security policy measure, and one which will have a 
decisive influence on Austria's position for coming years and 
decades. 
  [Seidl] Will things then work more quickly? Will we be 
helped more quickly if we are ever threatened? 
  [Fasslabend] One must certainly assume that different 
yardsticks are used for an EU member state than for a country 
that just stands on its own. Therefore, joining the European 
Union, belonging to this community, is certainly of enormous 
importance. 
  However, things go beyond that. EU membership today not only 
entails a lower probability of being attacked and a quicker 
reaction by other states, but from the outset a reduced 
probability of a conflict that might affect our country. This 
means that we would have more possibilities to influence the 
preventive settlement of crises and conflicts in our 
surroundings and we could, thus, certainly make a certain 
contribution to the stability of our entire surroundings. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Mayer] What do the analyses and information that you have 
obtained tell you about what the Serbian side is expected to do 
if a military strike is carried out [after the expiration of the 
ultimatum]? 
  [Fasslabend] One has to distinguish between the military 
part and what is going on beyond that. 
  [Mayer] I mean the entire security sphere. 
  [Fasslabend] In military terms, the case would be that NATO 
forces would be united from various cities in Italy, would be 
combined somewhere over the Adriatic Sea, would refuel, and 
then, accompanied by an escort, would fly to Sarajevo, establish 
an air shield there -- that is, ensure their own safety -- and 
then, using exact maps, try to hit the heavy artillery. 
  [Mayer] Well, what I asked you about are the Serbian 
reactions. 
  [Fasslabend] In this case, one cannot expect any major 
military reactions by the Serbs because the weapons they have 
there would be relatively insufficient. 
  On the other hand, there have been threats of reactions 
beyond that, and one certainly has to take these threats 
seriously. It is certainly not so easy to say what these 
threats refer to, but, basically, they probably refer to 
terrorist activities. 
  [Mayer] What kind of precautions are being taken? 
  [Fasslabend] Basically, Austria is actually not a country 
that would be affected directly. Planes are not taking off from 
our territory; we are not an aggressor, and we are not a direct 
neighboring country. On the other hand, however, in addition to 
Italy, we are the nearest Western country and, therefore, one 
can certainly not rule out anything. One can only prepare very 
consistently for this situation and for all potential incidents 
by watching all events with utmost attention and by taking 
appropriate measures, which has been done. 
  [Mayer] Even though no planes are taking off from Austria, 
our territory is regularly and often flown over by planes that 
are preparing for this military operation. Obviously, there are 
quite a few flights that we always permit. 
  [Fasslabend] This is correct, but this has been the case for 
many years. This means there is no special situation now as a 
result of the UN decision. We constantly have supply flights 
for the UN troops in Yugoslavia cross Austrian territory and 
also trains running through Austria. However, this is also 
partly in the Serbs' interest. Therefore, I would not say this 
is being used as a reason to act against us. 
  [Lackner] I know this is a sensitive issue, but I would like 
to come back to colleague Mayer's penultimate question: Do your 
intelligence services have any information about potential 
terrorist activities in Austria? After all, Austria has been 
very exposed in political terms in the Bosnian issue. 
  [Fasslabend] As I said before, since we are not a 
neighboring country and have not carried out any aggressive acts 
and are not involved now, we can assume the center of such 
potential activities would not move toward Austria. Instead, 
one has to assume the Serbian side would probably try to bring 
about a turnabout in public opinion in those countries that have 
soldiers stationed in Serbia, in Yugoslavia -- that is, to make 
them stop their activities. This means one has to assume such 
activities would primarily be directed against countries that 
have sent troops. 
  Second, one would have to think that activities might also 
go 
beyond these countries. 
  [Lackner] yesterday Russian President Yeltsin warned against 
bombing and said this might have terrible consequences. Do you 
believe a new East-West conflict might develop in Bosnia? 
  [Fasslabend] I do not believe a new East-West conflict might 
develop along the lines of the old one because the conditions 
have changed completely. 
  [Lackner] Perhaps along the lines of the very old one. 
  [Fasslabend] However, what one has to see without any doubt 
is that the longer this war lasts, the more different the 
positions of the big powers become, which, sooner or later, 
might lead to discrepancies between individual states and, in 
the end, to the shattering of the cohesion, which means an 
enormous opportunity for Europe and which was very much in 
evidence two or three years ago and is still possible -- just 
think of the fact that the Russians are in the NATO Cooperation 
Council and participate in the deliberations there. The same 
goes for the Ukrainians, the Poles, the Czechs, and the 
Hungarians. This is doubtlessly something that must be included 
in one's calculations in this connection. 
  Therefore, I think the quicker this problem is solved, the 
quicker the international community comes to an agreement, the 
smaller the possibility will be that Europe might be in 
disagreement again. After all, one has to see one thing -- if 
military aggression were to be successful in Yugoslavia, if this 
becomes a political method, one can almost make bets on when the 
next military aggressor will turn up. 
  At the same time, this also leads to a loss of the Islamic 
world's trust in the Western community of states because they 
get the feeling that the West's determination is not so great if 
a conflict does not involve oil fields but only people who 
belong to a non-European religion. I think this would be very, 
very dangerous. 
  After the end of the East-West conflict and after the 
collapse of the Eastern system of power, we have had a unique 
opportunity for the first time all over the world, namely that 
all states orient themselves toward the Western values, toward 
democracy, human rights, the relevance of international law. It 
would be fatal if this opportunity were missed, if one were to 
get the feeling that these are only instruments to implement the 
Western policy of power and are not really values actually 
enforced by the people and the democracies in the West if they 
need to be protected. 
  [Mayer] Why is the security aspect, which we have 
discussed and which is really important for Austria, hidden with 
embarrassment in the government's arguments for EU membership or 
is pushed into the background? The Austrians' need for security 
does exist -- we know that and it has been confirmed by the 
polls. Would it not be possible to get broader agreement to the 
European Union by pointing to this important aspect? 
  [Fasslabend] I do not know whether one could achieve a 
broader agreement with that argument, but I think the time has 
come to tell the people in Austria how important EU membership 
would be for the country's security. I can only repeat what I 
said a few minutes ago: For Austria's security, our joining the 
Europan Union is the most important step since the conclusion of 
the State Treaty. This is the basis. We can assume membership 
would not only entail a far higher degree of military stability, 
would not only ensure Austria's safety and freedom, but also 
would ensure lastingly all our opportunities and our ability to 
develop. Just as the State Treaty constituted the basis for the 
entire state for almost four decades, the EU treaty today is 
probably the basis for the next three or four decades -- in 
security policy and also for the economy and for overall 
politics. 
  [Seidl] This also has a reverse side -- i.e., solidarity is 
not just a one-sided issue but means that we, too, have to show 
solidarity with others; we have to give up what we have 
understood so far to be neutrality, find a new understanding of 
neutrality, or give up neutrality completely. We must also 
expect that we will be called upon to show solidarity -- for 
instance, one sees tensions are rising between Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and Greece -- that we 
will be called upon to stand up for Greece's security interests 
with Austrian soldiers, or what Greece considers to be its 
security interests. 
  [Fasslabend] Basically, the position of neutrality certainly 
changed fundamentally after the end of the Cold War. It was a 
product of the Cold War -- as it is put so aptly -- and, 
therefore, it lost its function when the Cold War ended. Still, 
we need not throw it overboard. Austria will enter the European 
Union as a neutral country, if the people so wish. The 
precondition for that is a referendum. 
  As soon as we are in the European Union and when future 
solidarity is involved, then one must say the following: The 
probability that Austria will have to stand up for others in 
some incident is extremely low. The entire area of West Europe 
is no longer facing any immediate threat, if one considers the 
fact that countries like the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, 
or France do not have any opponent in the neighborhood anymore, 
but they are only surrounded by friendly countries. This means 
we must ask ourselves whether the other countries would be 
willing to stand up for us if a crisis develops in our 
neighborhood, because we are the only European country that has 
four neighbors from the former Communist sphere and, therefore, 
we are affected to a particularly great extent by developments 
and potential crises in this area. 
  In this case, it is certainly good to have friends and to 
have the opportunity to go to them as soon as a crisis starts 
and draw their attention to it, because we must also be clear 
about one thing: One must explain crises and factors of risk to 
those who make decisions in West Europe. These crises are 
noticed much later from a distance of 1,000 or 2,000 km. We saw 
this in Yugoslavia, where Austria was the first country that 
constantly pointed to this crisis, where it was certainly a 
disadvantage for us that we were not yet in the European 
Community. In the future, it will be all the more important to 
be in it and to be able to directly present issues that concern 
us. [passage omitted] 
  [Mayer] The government agrees we have to join the European 
Union for a number of reasons, also for the security aspect. 
However, the government does not say anything about the form in 
which we want to participate in such a collective alliance. 
Obviously, it does not really agree among itself. For the time 
being, citing a number of arguments, we have refused using a 
number participate in Partnership for Peace. How does the 
defense minister envisage that? A few weeks ago you were at a 
NATO conference in Berlin in your official capacity. How do you 
envisage that? What would be the ideal form of cooperation for 
Austrian national defense? 
  [Fasslabend] Well, I must make one thing clear: Austria has 
not only decided that it wants to participate in the EU, but the 
Austrian Government has also made it clear that, as soon as 
Austria becomes an EU member, it should also obtain observer 
status in the Western European Union [WEU]. From the security 
policy point of view, this is certainly a very big and important 
step, because in the WEU we will have the opportunity to present 
our analyses and ideas from the very start and to participate in 
all security policy aspects in Europe. This means that this 
step is already planned. 
  The issue of the Partnership for Peace, which has been 
discussed all over Europe in the past weeks, is certainly also 
an interesting development, which, however, is primarily aimed 
at the East Europeans and the people in East and Central Europe 
and not so much at the neutral countries, like Sweden, Finland, 
Switzerland, and Austria, even though the latter are not 
excluded. 
  One can already say that we certainly consider Partnership 
for Peace to be a very valuable instrument in shaping future 
security and peace in Europe, but we naturally see our priority 
in joining the European Union and Partnership for Peace is of 
secondary importance for us. 
  What we are going to do -- to say this quite specifically -- 
is that in those fields where we have already started 
cooperation, such as in peacekeeping, disaster relief, 
international doctrines, etc., we will engage in large-scale 
cooperation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [APA report: "More Foreigners Turned Back at the Border"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- Austria's borders last year were largely 
closed: The number of people who were turned back, expelled, or 
deported from Austria increased greatly in 1993. According to 
the Interior Ministry, this is proof of the effectiveness of 
pollice measures regarding aliens. 
  A total of 160,394 people were turned back at the border, 
approximately 49,000 more than in 1992. The number of 
expulsions rose from 1,723 to 3,846. The number of deportations 
-- 8,857 (plus 1,501) -- almost reached the level of 1991. 
  Only the number of people who were sent back to the country 
where they were previously fell from 8,221 to 5,437. This 
refers to people who enter the country illegally and are sent 
back to the country where they were previously within 14 days. 
  The reason the number decreased by so much is mainly because 
the number of illegal border crossings recently has been 
steadily declining. Romanians, in particular, who used to 
attempt to cross the border illegally in relatively large 
numbers are not entering the country illegally as often anymore. 
The reason for this is relatively simple: Hungarian checks are 
much stricter now, and the route through the former Yugoslavia 
is largely blocked by the war in Bosnia.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Belgium will send 150 
reinforcement troops to Sarajevo to monitor NATO's demand that 
all heavy weapons be withdrawn from around the capital, Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes announced here Monday [21 February]. 
  Claes said the troops would be redeployed from Croatia where 
they are currently stationed, and added that he was pleased the 
Serbs had abided by the NATO ultimatum Sunday thus averting air 
strikes. 
  "The various warring parties in Bosnia must understand that 
we are ready to extend the (NATO) ultimatum if we realize that 
atrocities are continuing in other regions," he said. "And it 
goes without saying that we want to revive negotiations that 
could lead to a peace accord." 
  Belgium has 1,038 UN peacekeeping troops in the former 
Yugoslavia, 708 of whom are in Croatia.

closure of the border. Earlier we spoke by telephone with 
Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, who is currently in Athens: 
  [Begin Claes recording] I think that the Germans and the 
Belgians are on exactly the same wavelength. We appreciate that 
Greece has a problem which should not be underestimated, but we 
nevertheless think that the decisions made contravene the 
substance of the treaties which govern the European Union. 
Those decisions have to be justified to the Twelve -- not with 
the aim of making a great incident out of this, but with the aim 
of creating conditions which might allow the resumption of 
dialogue between The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM] and Greece. [end recording] 
  On Monday [21 February], the Twelve will discuss this issue. 
In the meantime, Albania has offered its ports to FYROM, while 
Russia has offered its mediation.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Netherlands Brigadier General Van </F>
Baal by Wio Joustra; place and date not given: "The United 
Nations Cannot Force a Solution"--first paragraph is VOLKSKRANT 
introduction] 
  [Text] Netherlands Brigadier General Van Baal leaves for 
Bosnia next week, where he will be under the direct command of 
UN commander Rose. In Kiseljak, he will be involved in 
diplomacy, bureaucracy and the constant threat of an escalation 
of violence which could also turn against UN soldiers. 
  [Van Baal] This function will be the first where I am 
involved in operations under war conditions. It is probably a 
situation which has always been the backdrop for my actions, my 
training, and my career as a soldier. 
  In this type of situation, however, I am now really in the 
right place. 
  Ad van Baal is a brigadier general. He is a gunner, 47 years 
old, who will become the new chief of staff of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Command in Kiseljak. In other words, he is 
second in command to the British Lieutenant General Sir Michael 
Rose, currently causing a furore in the international media. 
  This veteran of the Falklands, one of several highly admired 
by Margaret Thatcher, with his typical British stiff upper lip, 
seems slowly but surely to be taking control of ravaged Sarajevo 
on behalf of the international community. He is stationing blue 
helmets at strategic points in the capital to show that the 
United Nations is serious about monitoring and controlling 
observance of the ultimatum which runs out early on Monday [21 
February] morning. 
  [Joustra] Is Rose a whiz kid? 
  [Van Baal] During my reconnaissance visit I was extremely 
impressed by him, particularly the clear vision he has of the 
function of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and by the determination which he radiates. 
In addition, he is also a warm and captivating man. 
  [Joustra] He seems quite domineering. 
  [Van Baal] First, he is the commander. Second, I am the 
chief of staff and, generally speaking, sensible commanders use 
their staff. Period. You cannot simply go by what you see on 
the news. That is often the result of many hours of work. 
  Van Baal, who succeeds the British General Ramsey, leaves 
on Thursday of next week for 6 months in Kiseljak. He already 
has his reward. As from September, he will get a star going 
from one star to two. This week, Defense Minister Ter Beek 
appointed him deputy commanding officer of the land forces, as 
successor to major general Reitsma, who will head the 
German/Netherlands army for the first 3 years. 
  However, Van Baal is not yet thinking about this office job. 
A difficult task awaits him -- this weekend could well be 
crucial for the chances of a peaceful solution to the bloody 
conflict in Bosnia. In the days leading up to the expiration of 
the ultimatum, political pressure on the Serbs is being stepped 
up. 
  There is a real danger that bombings will take place and 
that 
there will then be retaliation against the blue helmets. 
Nevertheless, Van Baal is assuming that he will be going on 
Thursday. 
  [Van Baal] The ultimatum is very clear: Intervention could 
take place, and everyone is bearing that in mind too. 
  [Joustra] This does not however solve the Bosnian question. 
  [Van Baal] One of the characteristics of UNPROFOR's task is 
to ensure that the conditions are created whereby the warring 
parties reach solutions together. UNPROFOR cannot force those 
solutions. It is not therefore simply a question of exercising 
military power and showing the flag, but of working hard to 
bring them around the negotiating table. 
  As chief of staff, Van Baal will be in charge of 200 
professional officers simply picked up from the NATO base in 
Rheindalen, Germany, and dumped in Kiseljak. Kiseljak is seen 
by the men in the field as an unwieldy, bureaucratic body. This 
is because, in addition to the 200, there are also twice that 
many support staff. In the Netherlands transport unit in 
Vusovaca, a poster hangs on the wall bearing the text: "Never 
have so few been led by so many." 
  Van Baal seems even now to be getting involved in a 
controversy about the size of his staff. He is measured and 
diplomatic. 
  [Van Baal] All these people have obviously been needed to 
allow the staff to operate. I do not let myself be influenced 
by numbers. I will judge soon whether there are too few or too 
many staff. 
  In addition to being in charge of the staff, Van Baal is 
expected to give balanced advice to General Rose about current 
matters and matters affecting the longer term. 
  [Van Baal] We are in charge of ten battalions of various 
nationalities, with all their individual dimensions and 
characteristics. This makes about 30,000 men who are in charge 
of protecting "safe havens" and protecting humanitarian aid 
convoys. 
  He still has to work with Rose on an exact distribution of 
tasks, but Van Baal is assuming that he will also have a 
diplomatic role. This will involve negotiating with the chiefs 
of staff of the Serbian, Muslim and Croatian troops to make sure 
that food can be transported to its destination without 
obstruction. 
  [Van Baal] The conflict between the warring parties is 
concentrated on the roads. They are of crucial importance to 
them, and for food convoys. The two go together.. That is why 
the problems we are now facing have arisen. 
  From Havelte, where Van Baal was commander of the then still 
poorly mobilizable 43d mechanized brigade, to Kiseljak is a step 
not devoid of risk. 
  [Van Baal] The military is a violent organization. If 
necessary, violence can be used, which leads to the risk that 
the violence can rebound. 
  That is unavoidable. You can protect yourself adequately 
from it, however, through the professionalism of your men and 
through your resources. 
  [Joustra] Do you think, though, since your appointment to 
this post, about the danger to which you personally can be 
exposed? 
  [Van Baal] You have to start by having faith in yourself. I 
have no experience in this field, but I put myself into it. My 
job can be compared to that of a police officer who has to track 
a hardened criminal, or a fire-fighter attacking a blazing 
inferno. Obviously, you think about the dangers. You know that 
when you look into the eyes of your wife. She supports you, but 
there is a huge gap between supporting something and being 
wildly enthusiastic about it.

  [Excerpt] PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has asked the 
Netherlands to mediate in the peace process in the Middle East. 
He made his request at a meeting with members of the Dutch 
Government in The Hague. It is not yet clear whether the 
Netherlands is prepared to take on the role of mediator. 
  'Arafat said the peace talks with Israel have reached a 
critical phase. If agreement on Palestinian autonomy is not 
reached soon, he said, the credibility of the peace process will 
be threatened. He added that Israel has agreed to release all 
Palestinian prisoners. Their release was one of the PLO's 
conditions for a peace accord with Israel. [passage omitted]

  [Text] "Positive signals are emerging": These optimistic 
comments were made by Prime Minister Ciampi about developments 
in Bosnia, following the Russian initiative (which Yeltsin had 
informed him about in advance). 
  Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri has also expressed optimism: 
"These are encouraging developments. Moscow has played a 
positive role in the peace process." But we must "wait for 
things to become certain before deactivating the NATO 
intervention plan." In other words NATO aircraft will remain on 
the runway at Aviano.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Italian Christian Democratic leader </F>
Ciriaco De Mita by Federico Geremicca in Rome on 16 February: 
"De Mita Is Bitter: Martinazzoli Has Betrayed Me"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Geremicca] Is it true that you 
will run all the same, on your own ticket, in Irpinia? 
  [De Mita] I know that they are saying this, that some people 
are afraid that I will. But I reply no. It is as if an editor 
were to decide to set up a completely new newspaper on his own. 
It is an option which does not appeal to me. I know others will 
do this. But finally, everyone has his own past to bear. 
  [Geremicca] But is it not true that you have thought about 
it, and that you are thinking about it, and that there are 
people asking you to take such a step? 
  [De Mita] I'm thinking about it. There are people who say 
that I ought to do so, but frankly I do not know. Moreover, 
look, I am handling this matter with a great degree of 
detachment. It is true that the deluded and angry people from 
the left of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] could have 
banded together, and I would note that there are many of them 
around in Italy. But we have not done this, and there is now no 
longer time to do so. And it seems to me that the left of the 
DC no longer exists. And if, on the other hand, it does exist, 
then it is this which should constitute the Italian Popular 
Party [PPI]. 
  [Geremicca] So, you are not forming your own party. What are 
you going to do then? 
  [De Mita] I am organizing myself. 
  [Geremicca] What do you mean, excuse me? 
  [De Mita] I mean that I am remaining in the PPI, but I am 
going into opposition against everything. I can put it in 
writing, explaining, however, that running as a candidate has 
nothing to do with this, because Mino [Martinazzoli] knows how 
things stand. 
  [Geremicca] And how do they stand? 
  [De Mita] We have spoken about this many times. I remember a 
discussion with him sitting there, on the sofa where you are 
sitting now. I had been the target of certain aggressive stands 
taken by his colleagues, such as Formigoni and Buttiglioni, with 
regard to electoral lists and people under investigation. I told 
him that I was concerned about how the agreement with [Pact for 
Italy leader] Segni was developing, and that I believed that it 
was essential to retain our own ticket and identity. And then I 
explained to him that, if there was a problem of needing new 
blood, I could have stood down, but certainly not for the 
reasons which these people were advancing. I told him also -- 
and there is an interview to prove it -- that if the agreement 
with Segni went on to accentuate certain features, the 
foundations were being laid for a rift between us. 
  [Geremicca] Which features are you referring to? 
  [De Mita] Let us tell the truth. They tried to strike off 
the electoral list all the leaders of the left, whispering that, 
if elected, we would push the party toward an agreement with the 
progressives. This is offensive: If indeed this was our 
objective, we would have gone into battle inside the PPI. 
Therefore it is untrue. While it is true that, through the 
candidate selection procedure, someone has tried to lay the 
foundations for a future majority of the right. This is not the 
PPI's original intention. The goal was to remain in the center 
and put ourselves forward as holding the balance in the 
postelection period. Look, if the problem was to win, to be in 
a majority, then we might as well have allied ourselves directly 
with the League and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, rather 
then with Segni's indecipherable pact, which seems to me to be a 
alignment of men without troops. 
  [Geremicca] Have you got it in for Segni, Martinazzoli, for 
whom? 
  [De Mita] Segni, he is a journalistic invention. He has 
followed a fairly interesting course, but without ever being 
aware of what he was doing. And then his swaying between right 
and left, his being first against and then with the DC, is proof 
in itself of his failure to have the humility to stop for a 
moment and think. Then, he has invented empty and dangerous 
trivialities. He has said that his Pact is not interested in 
future allies, but is aiming straight ahead, but without 
explaining, however, where this straight ahead is going. He 
repeats obsessively slogans of renewal and I say there is 
nothing new about what he is saying at all. But frankly, I 
already knew this about Segni, the fact is that I never thought 
for a moment of running on his ticket. 
  [Geremicca] And whom did you not know about, about 
Martinazzoli? 
  [De Mita] I believed that the relationship with 
Martinazzoli was marked by great sincerity. He knew, for 
example, that I was against the single ticket with the Pact and 
the constitution of a single parliamentary group led, moreover, 
by Segni, whom I do not think highly of. He knew that I was 
inclined to examine the possibility of a commitment outside 
parliament. My one request was that my integrity be safeguarded 
and defended, and therefore the possibility of this commitment. 
But he. Moro would have defined his approach as 
"indifference." But today indifference is dangerous. 
Unfortunately, in the behavior of this secretary I see a 
certain capacity to reflect, but an absolute incapacity to 
convert this into political initiative. He continues to 
demonstrate an attitude of great pain. But nobody is obliged to 
be in politics. 
  [Geremicca] So, troubled waters between you and the 
secretary? 
  [De Mita] Yes, but he cannot say that I did not tell him. It 
is a political problem, not a personal one. My running as a 
candidate enters into it up to a certain point. It is 
everything which he built up around it which has made me bitter. 
If my name has to be used in order to maintain that the 
electoral lists have been renewed, that there are no persons 
under investigation, then I can't agree to that. 
  [Geremicca] But Mr. De Mita, you are under investigation! 
  [De Mita] I have nothing to do with certain stories. I have 
spoken with all the magistrates with whom I had to speak. Some 
of them almost apologized to me, and from the Turin public 
prosecutor's office there was even a statement explaining that I 
was not involved in any act of corruption. So, what are people 
talking about? And in any event, I repeat, on this point the 
problem is political. Because it is clear that Segni and certain 
people in the PPI are looking solely to be in a majority and to 
line up, after the election, with the reactionary bloc, with the 
League and with Berlusconi in particular. People who are 
feeding their election campaign more with superstitions, such as 
anticommunism, than with political arguments. 
  [Geremicca] What people still do not understood is whether 
you are saying goodbye to the PPI or not. 
  [De Mita] No, it is not a goodbye. I am staying in the PPI. 
It is not a goodbye, but the opening of a battle against a 
political direction which I find pretty dangerous. I have said 
it: I shall organize myself. Even if I know that it is not easy 
to organize oneself "against something" in a party which hardly 
exists. I only hope that, having missed their target, certain 
aggressive acts will cease, and that from now on I shall be 
judged on the opinions which I express and the deeds which I 
undertake. 
  [Geremicca] For whom will you be voting in the elections? 
  [De Mita] Whom do you want me to vote for? For the PPI. 
  [Geremicca] And you will take part in the election campaign? 
  [De Mita] I ought to say in public something which I said to 
you. And frankly, perhaps it is not necessary. 
  [Geremicca] A final question. In Irpinia, many people have 
protested about your being excluded from the lists. I would ask 
you again, you are not having second thoughts, inventing your 
own ticket and running in the election. 
  [De Mita] Yes, I know that there are protests. And on the 
other hand, they have barely voted in the primaries. What do 
you want me to say to them.... On Sunday I will go down, I 
will call a meeting and I will explain how things stand. As for 
my candidacy, no, I will not run outside the PPI.
