<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bonn Rejects Russian Accusations"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government has rejected the 
accusations by Colonel General Burlakov, commander in chief of 
the Russian forces in Germany, concerning alleged delays in the 
housing construction program for returning soldiers as 
unjustified. In a statement to the Bundestag Budget Committee, 
Mr. Goehner parliamentary state secretary in the FRG Economics 
Minister, stressed that the originally agreed goal of completing 
36,000 apartments by the end of 1994 is not in danger as far as 
one can say at the moment. 
  Goehner said that Burlakov's repeated accusations are due to 
his duty to care for his soldiers. According to the Russian 
Defense Ministry, about 220,000 apartments for soldiers are 
currently missing, and Germany's contribution is just 
alleviating the problem. 
  According to Goehner, some interim building deadlines have 
not been observed. The delays are three months at the most. 
The biggest delays happened in 1992. According to the state 
secretary, 15,000 apartments are finished. In total, the 
Federal Government provides 8.35 billion marks, with which at 
least 45,000 apartments in 40 building sights, including all 
technical and social infrastructure are being built. In 
addition, two housing construction combines and about 20 
factories for building and equipment materials are part of the 
program.

<F P=106> ["ay"-signed report: "Bonn Is Important Helper Concerning </F>
Integration in World Market"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has promised 
German support for Ukraine, which is facing economic 
difficulties. The Federal Government also wants to support the 
European Union [EU] efforts to help Ukraine. Kinkel spoke in 
favor of an early partnership agreement between the European 
Union and Ukraine. 
  Kinkel met in Bonn with members of a Ukrainian delegation, 
including Foreign Minister Zlenko, Economics Minister Shpek, 
Foreign Trade Minister Slyepichev, and Health Minister 
Spizhenko. For Minister Slyepichev, Bonn is one of the most 
important supporters of economic reforms in Ukraine. 
"Integration in the world market is decisive for our reforms," 
he stated in an interview with HANDELSBLATT. Since Chancellor 
Kohl visited President Kravchuk in Kiev last year, the exchange 
of views and information has become decisively faster and better. 
  For Kiev, it is important to intensify the dialogue with 
institutions like GATT, the World Bank, the IMF, and the 
European Union to ensure that "we can participate in the 
international division of labor without any restrictions." He 
sees a considerable market potential for Ukraine's independent 
space industry (including missile technology, radar plants, and 
satellites) and, above all, in the agricultural industry. 
  Slyepichev strongly rejected the often-voiced criticism by 
Western observers that there is not sufficient readiness for 
reform in Ukraine, that reforms are even being delayed. Ukraine 
even adopted more far-reaching reform laws in some areas than 
other reform states. No other country has so few restrictions 
for foreign investors who want to buy land within the framework 
of joint ventures or who want to establish enterprises. 
  A list of 30,000 state-owned enterprises which are to be 
privatized in the course of this year will shortly be published. 
In fact, large and commercial enterprises are involved, but 
small and medium-sized enterprises represent the majority. A 
modification of rules designed to promote joint ventures more 
effectively is also expected for this year. 
  One of the reasons for Ukraine's poor image is probably 
"that 
some media view Ukraine through special glasses." When 
assessing the country, one must not forget -- "which usually 
happens" -- that it was not possible for Ukraine to develop 
economic structures of its own in the past decades. "We were 
always part of the Soviet economic system." 
  Slyepichev rules out Ukrainian membership in the ruble zone. 
"If we wanted to join the ruble zone, we would not negotiate 
loans or a stabilization fund with the IMF." Generally, it is 
important to stabilize the currencies. He does not foresee any 
negative consequences, such as losses in foreign exchange 
holdings. 
  Slyepichev also sees positive aspects for his country 
resulting the agreement on the ruble zone between Belarus and 
the Russian Federation. Trade with the neighboring country 
Belarus, for example, can be carried out and cleared much more 
smoothly. Kiev is now negotiating a credit worth $700 million 
-- an IMF delegation is currently visiting Kiev -- but, 
according to Slyepichev, an additional fund should be discussed 
to stabilize the Ukrainian currency. "It takes much too long 
until the IMF actually provides the money, but our currency must 
be stabilized in the near future." 
  Slyepichev sees a clear link between Western credits and 
President Kravchuk's promise to disarm the nuclear weapons 
inherited from the former USSR. Health Minister Yuriy Spizhenko 
also believes that Ukraine's readiness to eliminate the nuclear 
weapons arsenal has a certain "market value." "In fact, we are 
the only state in the world that wants to eliminate its nuclear 
weapons completely. One reason is Chernobyl." Thus, Ukraine 
hopes for humanitarian aid so that the enormous problems 
concerning medical care can be settled. 
  The consequences of the Chernobyl disaster are not even in 
the foreground: "We have much more severe problems in the 
treatment of diabetes or in the sphere of anesthesia." The 
establishment of insulin factories is urgently required. The 
plans exist, and thus Ukraine is waiting for foreign aid to 
realize them according to the motto: We exchange weapons for 
health.

  [Text] Mexico City, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The German 
Government supports the U.S. position of getting Japan to open 
its market "not only in words but with actions," German Economy 
Minister Gunter Rexrodt said here today. The official 
emphasized, however, that Germany's support for Washington would 
be limited if the United States simply wishes to establish 
export or market quotas, because such measures could damage all 
international trade. 
  Last week, the United States announced it will retaliate 
against Japan because the Far Eastern nation has not allowed 
several U.S.-made products to enter its market. 
  The German minister, who has been on an official visit here 
since last Thursday [17 February], asserted that placing limits 
on exports will only lead to bilateralism, which runs against 
multinational agreements. He explained that such a decision 
"would violate GATT and would conflict with the interests of the 
world's large exporting nations." 
  Rexrodt said his country's investments in Mexico will 
increase if Mexico signs an agreement for reciprocal promotion 
and protection of investments. In 1993, 31 percent of Mexico's 
exports to Europe went to Germany and, in turn, Germany became 
Mexico's foremost commercial partner in the region. 
  After meeting with Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello 
Macias, Rexrodt explained that Germany has given Mexico priority 
status in its relations with Latin America. An example of this, 
he said, is the "Technogerma Mexico 1994" industrial fair, which 
was inaugurated by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
on Monday.

<F P=106> [Claus Gennrich report: "Germany Does Not Want To Act as </F>
Mediator"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 23 February -- If the Bosnian peace 
negotiations ever get so far that an agreement only requires 
final approval, a meeting between Western heads of government 
and Russian President Yeltsin might be considered, in the German 
view. Bonn has not yet definitely approved this idea. However, 
it is said that the implementation of a peace plan is the 
decisive thing; following the movement that brought Moscow into 
the political game Russia wants to continue to be visibly 
involved. 
  Regarding Moscow's role, one can hear it said in Bonn that 
the NATO ultimatum permitted Yeltsin to put pressure on Serbia; 
this permitted the Serbs to preserve their face by saying they 
were heeding the wish of the friendly Russians. While Yeltsin 
remained incommunicado for days, the plan for Russian influence 
on the Serbs and participation in the decisions of the United 
Nations and the Western states was worked out in Moscow, it is 
said in Bonn. 
  Obviously, Russia's "Yugoslavia" envoy Churkin let Foreign 
Minister Kinkel know in Bonn on Tuesday [22 February] that the 
West should not set new ultimatums because Moscow could not tell 
the Serbs every day that they have to give in again or else NATO 
would take action. Kinkel indicated that Russia should be 
included in the process, but Moscow could not claim a veto 
right. Now the respective possibilities of influence should be 
used: The United States, Germany, and the Netherlands are the 
most important interlocutors of the Muslims; Germany could 
influence the Croats; Russia, France, and Greece are listened to 
by the Serbs. 
  In Germany's view, Russia should particularly influence 
Serbian leader Karadzic so that Tuzla airport can be opened. In 
Bonn one can hear that Russia is trying that, but it does not 
want pressure to be exerted on Moscow to accept new ultimatums. 
In a telephone conversation with Kinkel, NATO Secretary General 
Woerner warned against threats by the West against the Serbs so 
long as military actions have not been examined thoroughly as to 
their effectiveness and have been prepared. Nevertheless, NATO 
must reserve itself the right to set further ultimatums. 
Kinkel, too, thinks that ultimatums can be applied to other 
areas in Bosnia; however, action will not be taken by 
automatically following the pattern of Sarajevo. 
  The Federal Government does not want to act as mediator in 
the search for peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Kinkel wants to 
provide a an "offer of good services" in arranging meeting 
places in the technical sense. Chancellor Kohl's many telephone 
conversations with President Clinton, contacts between European 
foreign ministers, and the German humanitarian performances are 
also below the threshold of concrete mediation. In Kinkel's 
view, Germany should not permit itself to be thrust into the 
role of an official mediator; because of the still unclear 
interpretation of the Basic Law and the historic burdens, 
Germany must be cautious. One must also bear in mind the Serbs' 
sensitivity about Germany. Obviously, Bonn does not want to 
push ahead against the smaller partners in the European Union 
and potentially distrustful governments, such as the British. 
  However, it is said that the Federal Government is already 
preparing for the fact that it will hardly be possible for 
Germany to continue to play its modest and restrained role in 
this way, if in May the Federal Constitutional Court were to 
affirm that out-of-area military operations are permissible. In 
addition, the German presidency of the European Union during the 
second half of this year requires the Germans to coordinate 
efforts. So far, the Federal Government has insisted that, for 
historical reasons, participation in missions in the area of the 
former Yugoslavia will not be possible even if the controversy 
about the interpretation of the Basic Law is settled. 
  On Wednesday Foreign Minister Kinkel talked to Croat Foreign 
Minister Granic in Bonn about the latter's talks with Haris 
Silajdzic, the representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bonn 
meeting was dedicated to efforts to harmonize the differing 
attitudes of the Croats and the Muslims in negotiations about 
varieties of a confederation plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina. On 
Wednesday there was a round of talks in Zagreb with mediators 
Stoltenberg (United Nations) and Own (European Union). Kinkel 
gained the impression that the Croats are flexible regarding 
confederation plans. The events surrounding Sarajevo are 
causing pressure on the parties to the conflict and, therefore, 
the prospects for an agreement have improved. 
  Kinkel also discussed with Granic suspicions that regular 
Croatian troops are fighting in Bosnia. Granic answered that 
there are three groups. Bosnian Croats, who had been in Croatia 
during the fighting there, and who returned to Bosnia after the 
war in Croatia and are now fighting in Bosnia. The Government 
in Zagreb cannot do anything about them. In addition, 
volunteers from Croatia have gone to Bosnia and are 
participating in the fighting against Muslim units in central 
Bosnia. The Croatian Government cannot stop volunteers. 
Finally, regular Croatian troops have also stayed on the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina along the Neretva River, which 
flows into the Adriatic. A total of 600 of these soldiers have 
been withdrawn over the past few days. The rest -- Granic 
obviously did not say how many -- will follow. The accusation 
of involvement by Croatian troops in the fighting only refers to 
the last group and will soon be settled. 
  Kinkel asked Granic about Croatian prison camps in Bosnia. 
Granic said that 100 Muslim prisoners-of-war are being held in a 
prison near Mostar. In addition, the Bosnian Croats have a camp 
with 1,200 inmates. The other camps have been disbanded. The 
Red Cross has free access to those camps that still exist. In 
contrast, the Muslims are holding 5,000 to 6,000 prisoners in 
camps, and the Red Cross does not have access to them. 
  Granic asked Kinkel about the possibilities of German 
economic aid. Kinkel promised that, after an overall settlement 
has been achieved and if Zagreb shows the appropriately flexible 
attitude, Germany will support Croatia's wish to be quickly 
brought close to the European Union. Germany will also provide 
economic aid. Kinkel did not supply any figures for this 
declaration of intent.

<F P=106> [Martin Winter report: "Iran and Bonn Plan To Revive </F>
Cultural Relations"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 24 February -- Germany and Iran want to 
approach each other cautiously again in cultural policy. During 
a meeting between Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi 
and Foreign Ministry State Secretary Dieter Kastrup, the 
discussion focused on the establishment of an institute to 
promote the German language in Tehran, the reestablishment of a 
German archaeological institute, and the opening of a German 
school in the Iranian capital for children from German-Iranian 
families. 
  According to the Iranian minister, the language institute 
could perhaps be considered as a first step toward the reopening 
of the Goethe-Institute. Today, Friday, Va'ezi will also be 
received by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
  Agreement was reached on having the German-Iranian Cultural 
Commission, which met in December 1991 for the last time, 
convene again. According to the Foreign Ministry, this was 
primarily the wish of the Iranians. Va'ezi's statement that the 
commission members are to meet this year have not been confirmed 
in Bonn. The Foreign Ministry wants to think about a date only 
if there is "movement" in Tehran, which means, for instance, 
that children from mixed marriages get access to the German 
school. Va'ezi said after the talks that his government is 
willing to make this concession. 
  Agreement was reached on holding a joint seminar on human 
rights issues in Tehran in April. In particular lawyers, 
judges, and "practical workers" are to participate in it. Over 
the next few weeks experts are to negotiate on the German 
language institute and the archaeological institute. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry, State Secretary Kastrup 
broached the persecution of British writer Salman Rushdie by a 
death sentence in connection with Tehran's desire for closer 
ties with the European Union. 
  As long as this sentence is upheld, there cannot be any 
normal relations. According to the Foreign Ministry, Kastrup 
rejected Va'ezi's claim that the matter is exclusively the 
business of Iran and Great Britain by pointing out that this is 
something that concerns the entire European Union.

<F P=106> ["tl"-signed report: "Waigel Describes Contribution to </F>
European Union as `Slightly Too High'"] 
  [Text] Hamburg -- At the congress of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU], Theo Waigel, chairman of the Christian 
Social Union [CSU], called on the CDU/CSU to wage an aggressive 
election campaign against the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] in the super election year 1994. 
  At the same time, he expressed the hope that Germany will 
have an inflation rate "with a two in front of the decimal 
point" by the end of the year. In addition, the finance 
minister called for a reduction of the German net contribution 
to the European Union, which is "slightly too high." 
  In his statements about the economic development, Waigel 
mentioned a growth rate of 1.5 percent for 1994. Bonn's tight 
consolidation policy was the precondition for the historically 
low interest rates. As a result of the reduction of interest 
rates in the past few months, an investment volume of about 30 
percent was created. Waigel criticized the "punitive tax" for 
persons without children, which was rejected by the CDU. The 
concept of family splitting, supported by the CDU, still has to 
be discussed, he pointed out. 
  Cassandra will not be elected, Waigel shouted amid the 
applause of the 1,000 delegates. Never before since 1949 has so 
much been accomplished in one legislative period as between 1990 
and 1994. The CDU/CSU must now ensure that no one will govern 
without or against the CDU and the CSU in Germany. Similar to 
Kohl, Waigel suggested that those who do not believe in he 
success of the CDU/CSU should give up their candidacy. 
  The CSU leader vigorously rejected a grand coalition in 
Bonn. 
He expressed the hope that the CDU and the CSU will not see any 
need for another grand coalition in this century. Waigel 
praised Kohl demonstratively for his achievements concerning 
German unity. The CSU leader described the chancellor as "a 
man, a tree, and a rock." 
  Waigel sharply attacked the SPD and its chairman Rudolf 
Scharping. He described the leading democrats as "swaying 
figures" whose names the leaders in other European capitals find 
difficult to spell. "No one tells as many lies as the SPD." 
  The CSU leader warned the voters against the Instead Party 
and the Republikaner. In Hamburg, the Instead Party took votes 
from the CDU, but what was achieved was the SPD's absolute rule. 
As a result of the protest votes for the Republikaner in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, the grand coalition there has become unable 
to act on the asylum issue. Germany cannot afford a Weimar 
situation. After Bismarck and Adenauer, another German 
chancellor -- Chancellor Kohl -- should not be removed too early.

<F P=106> [Interview with Theo Waigel, finance minister and CSU </F>
chairman, by Kai Diekmann and Dirk Hoeren; place and date not 
given: "CSU Chairman Waigel: `Rau Should Not Let Himself Be 
Elected by Armchair Communists!'"] 
  [Text] [BILD] Mr. Waigel, there are only eight months 
left until the Bundestag elections! How long will you give the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] to make a clear statement 
on the coalition? 
  [Waigel] The FDP cannot afford a zig-zag policy in this 
respect. It has always been well off with a coalition statement 
for the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union 
[CSU]. It would be good for the political situation in Germany 
if the FDP were to commit itself before the presidential 
elections! 
  If the Liberals were to hesitate with their coalition 
statement, we will relentlessly try to get their coalition 
voters in the election campaign. Then we will tell everybody 
who wants to vote for the FDP for the continuation of the 
coalition that they are making an uncertain choice with that! 
Then the FDP will have problems getting into the Bundestag at 
all. 
  [BILD] What do you recommend to the FDP regarding the 
presidential elections? 
  [Waigel] I expect the FDP will vote in the third ballot, at 
the latest, for CDU/CSU candidate Roman Herzog! The election of 
Johannes Rau with the help of FDP votes would be a disastrous 
signal for the continuation of the coalition. 
  [BILD] May Johannes Rau let himself be elected president 
with the votes of the Party of Democratic Socialism? 
  [Waigel] It is not permissible that Johannes Rau lets 
himself be elected president by the votes of armchair Bolsheviks! 
  In 1969, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] asked 
Gerhard Schroeder, the then CDU/CSU candidate for the office of 
president, again and again whether he would permit himself to be 
elected with the votes of the National Democratic Party of 
Germany [NDP]. The SPD must now accept being asked the same 
thing. 
  In this respect, the attitude of the CDU/CSU candidate is 
exemplary. 
  [BILD] From the purely arithmetic point of view, the results 
would currently be sufficient only for a grand coalition in 
Bonn. What will the CSU do then? 
  [Waigel] If the SPD were to be stronger than the CDU/CSU 
after the next Bundestag elections, the CSU would not 
participate in a grand coalition. Similar signals have also 
been heard from the CDU. 
  In this case, the SPD should form a minority government. 
Grand coalitions only lead to a strengthening of the extreme 
parties on the right and he left. 
  [BILD] When will taxes be lowered again? 
  [Waigel] Reunification has its price! We are coping with 
these burdens by having saved about 70 billion German marks [DM] 
and having raised taxes by about that amount. As soon as any 
leeway develops in the budget, we will use that to lower taxes 
again. 
  [BILD] What about the inflation rate? 
  [Waigel] In view of the price development, I consider it 
possible that the inflation rate will have a 2 in front of the 
decimal point by the end of the year. This gives rise to new 
leeway for interest rate reductions. Each percentage point of 
interest rate reductions opens up an investment volume of DM7 
billion. This is more than can be done by any investment 
program. 
  [BILD] Mr. Waigel, do you actually think that [former 
Environment Minister] Peter Gauweiler can ever again become a 
minister in Bavaria? 
  [Waigel] As district chairman, member of the CSU Presidium, 
and member of the CSU Executive Committee, Peter Gauweiler 
continues to be in the first rank of the party. We rely on him 
in the election campaign. Of course, someone who temporarily 
gets out of the line of fire can become a minister once again. 
Free of his office, it will be easier for him to refute the 
accusations.

<F P=106> ["na/tl"-signed report: "CDU Sets a Sign for Citizens' </F>
Society With Its New Basic Program"] 
  [Text] Hamburg -- The delegates of the Congress of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] in Hamburg unanimously adopted 
the new basic program of the CDU with one abstention. It is 
replacing the basic program adopted in Ludwigshafen in 1978. 
The Hamburg program is the first all-German basic program of a 
German party after reunification. 
  With the new program, the CDU is drawing conclusions from 
the 
intellectual and political changes in Germany, Europe, and the 
whole world. The basic program is characterized by the general 
motto "Freedom in responsibility." The idea of responsible 
freedom belongs to the Christian concept of man of the CDU. 
  According to the chairman of the CDU committee responsible 
for drafting the party principles, Reinhard Goehner, the program 
follows the ideal of a free and responsible society, a citizens' 
society as opposed to an individualistic-privatistic affluent 
society. The "distribution society" is to be replaced by a 
"responsible society." 
  The program does not include a proposal leading to higher 
state expenditure, Goehner stressed. In areas where a higher 
expenditure is required, funds should be shifted in a way that 
no additional costs arise. This means that the CDU will have to 
reduce the new indebtedness, which rose as a result of German 
unification, and the state quota and taxes and charges. 
  The development of the social market economy into an 
ecological and social market economy was the subject of a 
controversial discussion at the party congress. As reported 
yesterday, the delegates voted in favor of this change by 359 to 
279 votes. The expansion of the social market economy to an 
ecological and social market economy was primarily rejected by 
representatives of the Economic Council and the social 
committees. They were against watering down the trademark 
social market economy. 
  According to Goehner, the development of the economic and 
social system into an ecological and social market economy and 
the preservation of God's Creation are the major messages of the 
new basic program. In order to use the strength and the 
innovative power of the economy to a greater extent to protect 
the environment, the CDU want to integrate ecological elements 
in the tax law more than in the past, and it wants to introduce 
environmental surcharges, possibilities for compensation, and 
regulations concerning certificates and liability. 
  Largely in conformity with the action program for growth and 
employment, which was also adopted by the CDU Congress, the 
basic program contains a catalogue of measures and demands 
designed to strengthen Germany's attractiveness as a business 
location and to create new jobs. 
  With the basic program, the CDU acquires a stronger profile 
as the "party of the family." After a heated debate, the 
congress voted in favor of family splitting. In order to 
safeguard the multi-generation agreement [to finance pensions] 
in view of the demographic changes, the CDU advocates 
family-friendly measures in the tax and social insurance law. 
It wants to acknowledge the additional burdens resulting for 
parents from child education to a greater extent as 
contributions within the pension system. 
  The pension insurance is to remain contribution-oriented and 
thus performance-oriented. The CDU advocates linking the 
pensions with the development of the wages of the employees and 
their prosperity. Labor Minister Bluem again rejected uniform 
pensions. A basic pension would be a service for drop-outs, 
financed by others. 
  The social committees expressed satisfaction with the 
results 
of the discussions of the program. Social gaps of the draft 
have been eliminated. The prospect of a "negative tax," 
proposed by the Christian Democratic Employees and the Economic 
Federation, was adopted. This is a milestone in the sphere of 
tax policies. 
  In the discussion about the part of the CDU's new basic 
program devoted to domestic policies, several speakers attacked 
the opposition in Bonn, the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD]. The legacy of the so-called 1968-generation continues to 
largely dominate the policy and program of the SPD, Bundestag 
member Rupert Scholz from the CDU criticized. For the CDU in 
Germany, this is nit acceptable -- neither politically, legally, 
nor ethically. It is true that the state has to ensure the 
freedom of its citizens, but freedom must also serve the 
community and take into consideration moral and ethical values. 
"Unconditional and irresponsible libertinage" is unacceptable. 
  Late on Tuesday [22 February], a debate about the 
significance of plebiscites in the CDU's new basic program took 
place. The CDU of Saxony demanded that the sentence should be 
deleted from the draft program according to which the CDU 
rejects referendums at the federal level. This option must at 
least be kept open for the new laender, a speaker demanded. 
Scholz and CDU Bundestag member Friedbert Pflueger, however, 
were against that. Only in a parliamentary democracy can the 
consensus be achieved that is required in a pluralist society, 
Scholz stated. He accused the SPD of discrediting parliamentary 
democracy with its support for plebiscites. Pflueger warned 
against devaluating parliamentary decisions through referendums. 
Finally the few delegates who were left late in the evening 
spoke in favor of not eliminating the sentence that the CDU 
rejects referendums at the federal level. 
  Interior Minister Manfred Kanther defended the law on the 
fight against crime, which will be discussed at the Bundestag 
today, Thursday. It includes two dozens of important measures 
that cannot be renounced only because it was not possible to 
achieve a consensus on other major issues. Referring to the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany, which largely rejects the 
"great bugging campaign," Kanther stressed that the alarming 
crime rate among foreigners who stay in Germany for a short 
period should not be concealed. On the other hand, the crime 
rate among Germans and foreigners who stay in Germany for longer 
periods is the same. Johannes Gerster, deputy chairman of the 
Bundestag group of the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU], also 
spoke in favor of stressing the issue of internal security 
during the election campaign. 
  The debate about European policies was unexpectedly 
peaceful. 
The old basic program still included the goal of a democratic 
European federal state, to be organized on the principle of 
subsidiarity. However, in the discussion about the new CDU 
basic program, the element of a federal state was accorded less 
significance. After a short debate, the CDU Congress agreed on 
the formulation, adopted earlier by the Executive Committee, 
that the European Union should be shaped in a "free, democratic, 
federal, and subsidiary manner." In his speech, Finance 
Minister Theo Waigel tried to play down the differences between 
the CDU and parts of the CSU over Europe's future. Waigel 
stated that the treaty on the European Union does not provide 
for federal states. 
  In their speeches, the CDU officials were generally critical 
of the press. As a result, restrictive regulations for the 
media were included in the basic program. Thus, the right to 
counter-declarations should be widened for the affected persons, 
and every citizen should be granted a legal claim for damages 
against the press and the radio. 
  The SPD criticized the CDU's new basic program. The CDU has 
abandoned the social market economy and embarked on the path of 
a "slightly modified Thatcherism." The tradition-conscious 
Christian Democratic Employees are apparently losing influence. 
The new program will not stop "the draining process concerning 
contents and personnel, for which Kohl is personally 
responsible," SPD spokeswoman Dagmar Wiebusch stated.

<F P=106> [Claus Duemde report: "The Chairman: `Still a Leftist? I Do </F>
Not Know....'"] 
  [Text] "What I am doing now does not have much to do with 
rationality, but really has more to do with Don Quixote," is how 
Ruth Marti, chairman of the Party of East German Unity (OPDE), 
speaking in Berlin yesterday, described the attempt by over 
2,400 members to mobilize non-voters and potential right-wing 
voters before the land elections in the former GDR "to assume 
political responsibility for shaping the new German state." In 
its document on general policy guidelines, the OPDE presents 
itself as a "social-liberal alternative" for representing the 
interests of east Germans -- and is evidently also an 
alternative to the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. 
  "Still a leftist -- I do not know," said Ruth Martin, 
pre-empting a question from journalists, as she explained the 
OPDE policy guidelines. What is obvious is that many of the 
party stances and demands could just as easily appear in a PDS 
(election) program and in Gysi's "Ingolstadt manifesto," where 
they have to some extent been formulated in both a more detailed 
as well as a more intelligible manner. Thus, the lawyer 
described the inevitable question about what separates the party 
from the PDS as being among "those that I hate most." 
  Nevertheless, her answer seemed plausible: Among the 
potential non-voters in the east -- and she estimates that they 
could account for as much as 40 percent of the electorate there 
-- are many people who would never vote for the PDS and would 
rather vote for the right. "We do not want to take away 
concerned voters from anyone," she said, but added 
self-confidently that the establishment of the OPDE to represent 
eastern interests has already led to "a review within the PDS." 
  At the same time, the OPDE does not have any illusions about 
something similar occurring in the SPD [Social Democratic Party 
of Germany], the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], and FDP [Free 
Democratic Party]. "The old parties do not represent the 
interests of the Germans in the east," is the first sentence in 
the policy guidelines. However, their members, says Dan 
Mechtel, a 22-year-old law student at Humboldt University, 
include social democrats, Christians, and liberals. That is why 
he also sees no grounds for concern. 
  Ruth Martin stated clearly what does concern the OPDE: "Well 
over 2 million citizens are unemployed in the east.... 
Thousands of scientists have been fired, artists do not receive 
work, and research capacity has been extensively reduced. 
People have not only lost their jobs, but have also lost their 
social ties." 
  This is something that the party does not want to counter 
with nostalgia for the GDR, but by citing the constitution, 
"which we want to develop and defend." Equality before the law, 
but with certain special rights for the disadvantaged east 
Germans, is the main thread running through the policy 
guidelines that culminate in the slogan "one people, one law, 
one state," which does, of course, trigger negative associations 
among journalists. 
  The party explicitly states that it supports a "social free 
market economy," but stresses the word social. She demands that 
"industrial core areas" should not only be preserved, but with 
an eye to the markets in the east -- Ruth Martin said: "I want 
to take the train to Beijing" -- new ones should also be 
developed. 
  At the same time, the party also wants to protect 
manufacturers and traders from the excessive might of western 
concerns and demands conditions that would enable an east German 
middle class to emerge. 
  The OPDE calls itself the party of "human dignity and social 
justice." One of the ways in which this goal is to be achieved 
is through the "partial recognition of GDR laws on land 
ownership," which affects 50 percent of families in the east. 
"The fundamental human right to housing" should be secured 
through genuinely social housing construction projects and 
should not be linked to "the possibility that those on higher 
incomes have of living well." 
  Demands "that our country should once more be favorably 
disposed toward families and children" occupy a central place in 
the guidelines. The abortion law should be removed from the 
criminal code, says Dan Mechtel, and protecting the lives of 
children should be made a part of family law and "a duty for 
both parents." Ruth Martin wants, above all, to motivate women 
into being participants in the life of society once again. 
"They must enter politics and achieve equality that way," 
states the document. 
  Further on, the party demands "rights for the younger 
generation that would enable it to represent itself," 
apprenticeships and jobs for all young people, and 
"scholarships, irrespective of parents' earnings, that amount to 
at least as much as social assistance payments." 
  Apart from the work involved, the OPDE chairman said that 
the 
greatest handicap to crossing the 5-percent hurdle is to find 
partners -- "It is a grueling job; I have never worked so hard." 
Does that mean that she will now give up participating in the 
Bundestag elections? The established parties do not think much 
of the modified OPDE demand that 5 percent of the votes in one 
of the laender should suffice to be represented in the 
Bundestag. That is why the party will concentrate on elections 
at the land level, beginning with the forthcoming elections in 
Saxony-Anhalt.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F>
unidentified announcer and correspondents Annette Ardisson, 
Pierre Le Marc, Ralph Pinto, and Michel Polacco in Paris; 
monitored in progress--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] .... with Annette Ardisson, Pierre 
Le Marc, Ralph Pinto, and Michel Polacco. We begin with a 
traditional profile by Philippe Meyers of our guest. [passage 
omitted] 
  We will interview you this morning with Annette Ardisson, 
Pierre Le Marc, Ralph Pinto and Michel Polacco. As we were 
saying during a recent lunch meeting of the leaders of the 
majority, Jacques Chirac criticized the government on a certain 
number of issues. After this came criticism by [Parliament 
Speaker] Philippe Seguin and Valery Giscard d'Estaing. How do 
you explain this sudden surge of criticism from the leaders of 
the majority against the government, against you, and against 
Mr. Balladur? [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] This quarrel poses two very important 
problems. The first is the consequences of freezing nuclear 
tests. Jacques Chirac thinks that these consequences are [word 
indistinct]. You and Edouard Balladur think that they are not 
and that they are negligible. So why have you asked for a rapid 
resumption of tests? 
  The second problem is that of the supreme decision-maker, as 
you said earlier. These are, in fact, serious differences that 
are threatening the credibility of the majority. 
  [Leotard] Allow me please to correct one point of your 
statement. I have never asked for the rapid resumption of 
tests. The prime minister and I--and, in fact, all of the 
experts without exception--stress the fact that the current 
French deterrent force will be perfectly efficient until 2010. 
It will be perfectly efficient, and it is not threatened by 
anything. It is suitable, and it has fully carried out its 
mission, which is deterring possible aggressors. 
  On the other hand, when the time comes, as the current 
president does not want a resumption of tests, well it will be 
after the presidential elections of 1995. Tests should resume 
at the right time. 
  [Correspondent] When do you think? 
  [Leotard] Well, it will be up to the newly elected president 
to make this decision. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Mr. Minister, we will come back to this subject, 
of course. One question from Ralph Pinto on former Yugoslavia 
before the 0800 bulletin. 
  [Pinto] Simply a clarification, Mr. Minister. You and 
others, in fact, want to open the airport of Tuzla as the second 
phase that would follow the successful Sarajevo operation. Will 
this be on 7 March as you say, or on 18 March as UN forces on 
the spot claim? 
  [Leotard] Here is an issue that interests me a lot. I think 
it is important to open the Tuzla airport. We have said so 
since the first summit of the Atlantic alliance in January. 
Tuzla is a place that could serve as a transit point for 
humanitarian aid for the entire northeast of Bosnia. We, 
therefore, have to open the airport. I regret that the date has 
gradually been postponed because I think we should have done it 
during the Sarajevo operation. [passage omitted] 
  I think we should do all this at the same time as the 
Sarajevo operation is under way. 
  [Correspondent] Even if force has to be used? 
  [Leotard] Of course, of course. One should use force 
perhaps. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Francois Leotard is the guest of France-Inter 
this morning. Good morning, defense minister. 
  [Leotard] Good morning. 
  [Correspondent] Outside all circumstantial polemics, what is 
the philosophy of the White Paper you presented yesterday? 
  [Leotard] This is not polemics, it is the study of war 
[polemologie]--that is, the analysis of men's violence. We look 
around us, around France. We see that the world is being 
shattered and that this can hit our country. The world has 
completely changed in the last four years. We have thought 
about these themes and asked what is threatening our country, 
how to counter such threats, what type of weapons do we need, 
what are the alliances we need, what is the armament industry 
that would allow us to answer all these questions, and who are 
specifically the men and women of the national defense who can 
see their future included in a document. We have summed up all 
this in a White Paper. 
  It is an enormous job that involved several hundreds of 
people who, as experts, contributed to this analysis. The 
government finally acted as an arbiter between the various 
ministries concerned, because defense is not the sole business 
of the defense minister. It is the business of every French 
citizen and every administration. On the basis of this 
document, we will propose to the parliament a military program 
bill that will cover the period of 1995-2000. What we decide 
today will have consequences for the French people in 2010. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Let us go back to this morning's headlines, 
particularly Bosnia. We mentioned the cease-fire between the 
Croats and the Bosnians in the bulletin. Do you think it is 
serious this time? 
  [Leotard] We are always skeptical and cautious about cease- 
fires because there have been so many in the past. However, the 
direction taken by this one is interesting. I am convinced that 
a Bosnia .... [pauses] I am talking about Muslim Bosnia. Once 
again, the adjective makes no sense. We talk about Muslims, 
saying they are neither Croats nor Serbs to simplify things. A 
Muslim Bosnia that would be divided into six parts, as is the 
case today, would not enjoy great viability even if a peace 
agreement is signed on this plan. We have to know, and we have 
to say it in advance. In other words, there could be a signature 
at the bottom of the parchment--as the poet or the singer might 
say--but this signature could be contested the following day. 
We cannot build a six-part, fragmented state in Europe today. 
The idea of a rapprochement between two of the three warring 
parties is interesting. The U.S. proposal goes in that 
direction. Is it possible? One should examine it. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Doesn't the position you are defending-- 
rejecting the breakdown of Bosnia into small parts--contradict 
the position defended by Alain Juppe, who is pushing for the 
signing of the [word indistinct] agreement? 
  [Leotard] No, Juppe is absolutely right. It is his duty to 
start from what has already been accepted by the parties in the 
conflict. The plan put forward by the European Union is, or was 
for some time, accepted by the belligerents. I simply say that 
it is a starting point; let us be cautious. This document could 
be signed, and I hope we could do that because it would mean a 
cease-fire over all the territory. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Minister, you know very well that within 
Stoltenberg and Owen's negotiating team there are people who do 
not hide their opinion that a population exchange will have to 
take place between ethnically purified or at least homogenous 
states? 
  [Leotard] I will ask the French Government not to help under 
any circumstances such population transfers organized under the 
gaze of peacekeeping forces. We would be in strange 
circumstances, which would mean that peacekeeping forces would 
assist in the deportation or the movement of populations based 
on ethnic or religious criteria. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Stephen Smith: "Angola Demands Arms in Return </F>
for Its Oil"] 
  [Text] Is France prepared to lift its embargo against 
exports of military equipment to Angola, that country racked by 
the bloodiest war? Finding that out was the main reason for the 
official visit carried out yesterday by Angolan President 
Eduardo dos Santos, who had left the borders of Angola for the 
first time since the contested elections held in September 1992, 
which resulted in the resumption of the armed conflict. 
According to UN statistics, which cannot be checked but do 
indicate its order of magnitude, the civil war in Angola "is 
responsible for more than 1,000 deaths per day" and has uprooted 
approximately 3 million people, nearly one-third of the 
population. Under these circumstances, and although laborious 
peace talks have been under way since last November, could the 
French Government be planning to lift the military embargo? "A 
priori, no," replied an official French source yesterday, while 
adding: "Unless a political decision is made at the highest 
level..." 
  The Angolan request is dividing the government according to 
a 
variable political geometry: The president is against "anything 
that might risk appearing to send a bad signal while a peaceful 
solution is being sought." The prime minister's office is also 
"somewhat embarrassed by the bad timing," whereas the Ministry 
of Defense is "totally against" the idea, which is causing 
Francois Leotard's entourage of being suspected, in the words of 
one Angolan diplomat, of "supplying arms to the UNITA [National 
Union for Angolan Independence]," the rebel movement led by 
Jonas Savimbi. On the other hand, the Ministry of Cooperation 
stated that it was "in favor, with no qualms," while the 
Interior Ministry is so enthusiastic that the UNITA, in turn, 
suspects Charles Pasqua of having "profited from several 
unlisted cargoes of oil." There too, it is an accusation based 
on strictly no evidence, but which puts its finger on the raw 
spot of the war: Angolan oil, extracted by foreign companies 
and "pawned" -- up to the year 2000 -- by the government so that 
it could finance the purchase of arms. 
  Tomorrow afternoon, with a half-hour gap between them, 
Eduardo dos Santos will receive the new managing director of Elf 
Aquitaine, Philippe Jaffre, and the CEO of Aerospatiale, Louis 
Gallois. In simplified terms the situation can be summed up as 
follows: The oil will have to finance the weapons... However, 
Elf complains that it "is not earning any money in Angola," due 
to a "punishing and intolerable tax system." Hence the idea of 
making a deal that would benefit everyone, with the notable 
exception of the Angolan population. In exchange for 
renegotiating its contracts, the French company would prove 
"understanding" in the context of requests made by the 
government in Luanda, all this with the blessing of the French 
authorities, which not only want to sell arms and oil 
installations, but also offer some opposition to the major U.S. 
companies which have firmly established themselves on the 
Angolan platforms. 
  Will Edouard Balladur opt in favor of this "strategic view" 
while at the same time assuring himself of the tacit support of 
Francois Mitterrand? It is not clear. For France would then be 
accused of an ill-founded approach in the context of UN efforts 
at pacification, and would expose itself to reproaches of 
cynically putting its financial interests first. All the more 
so since the Luandan regime, despite emerging victorious in the 
election, is not distinguishing itself by an administration of 
exemplary integrity. In the diplomatic dispatches from the 
French Embassy, too, it is effectively made clear how those 
close to -- sometimes even related to -- President dos Santos 
are profiting from a war economy, especially by importing arms, 
setting up so-called intermediate companies to which the state 
addresses its orders and which, in the course of transactions, 
take juicy commissions. "To spell it out clearly," sums up one 
French source, "the war is yielding fat profits, whereas peace 
would be dangerous." 
  Today, more than 80 percent of the income of the Angolan 
state -- mainly its revenue through oil -- is spent on the war 
effort. Admittedly, this war was "imposed" on the government by 
the UNITA when, the day after its election defeat, the rebels 
took up their arms again. However, since then, the warmongering 
by the men in power has gained momentum, progressing from the 
"massacre of la Toussaint" in 1992, when the supporters of Jonas 
Savimbi were beaten to death in cold blood in Luanda, via the 
terrible pogroms in January 1993 against the Bakongo, people 
originating from around the border shared with Zaire, to the 
acts of violence orchestrated last December against Lebanese, 
Senegalese, and Mauritanian traders. The Angolan authorities 
have taken every opportunity to unload their responsibility onto 
scapegoats, at the cost of thousands of deaths. However, the 
misery is caused not only by the war, but -- as one official 
from the World Bank put it -- also by the government's 
incompetence, which "is aggravating the difficulties facing the 
Angolan people." 
  Today, these "difficulties" are such that in some areas of 
Luanda, into which 3 million inhabitants are now crammed, people 
are dying of hunger in the streets. According to the price 
index drawn up by the highly official National Institute of 
Statistics, inflation in the capital reached a level of nearly 
700 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, the state, remaining impervious 
to the suffering of the poorest citizens and open to all forms 
of trade, is self-sufficient. For instance, the government 
presented a new Audi car as a "gift" to each deputy of the 
National Assembly, now dubbed the "auditorium." Moreover, the 
"national" character of the Parliament is becoming the subject 
of increasing caution, for UNITA controls -- or rather, is 
rendering unsafe -- 70 percent of Angolan territory, ranging 
from the south east to the north, via the central plateau. 
  Like the government with its oil wealth, largely invested 
offshore, the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi are financing the 
pursuit of the war thanks to diamonds excavated by Zaire, where 
they have their home base. However, there too, what suffices 
for the purchase of arms is in no way enough to enable them to 
administer the "liberated areas." In Huambo, which has been the 
site of UNITA headquarters since last March, the number of 
children afflicted by vitamin deficiency is legion. In several 
provinces, according to humanitarian sources, the level of acute 
malnutrition is higher than 20 percent. And yet today, like 
never before, the civil population is being held hostage and 
humanitarian aid is being hijacked and used for blackmailing 
purposes. In Luanda, in preparation for the visit to France by 
the Angolan president, Michel Roussin, the minister of 
development cooperation had stated that this aid had become "an 
instrument of pressure." Like the call for arms?

Jean-Marie Le Pen's Ideas Accompanied by Renewed Apprehension 
With Regard to National Front"] 
  [Excerpts] Jean-Marie Le 
Pen and the National Front are passing through a difficult 
period. The winds have been unfavorable for them ever since the 
Right returned to power and Edouard Balladur became prime 
minister. The reversal in their fortunes, however, probably 
occurred one year earlier, in the regional and cantonal 
elections of March 1992. The regional election had been a 
psychological blow; the departmental election, a political blow. 
  At a time when it is holding its ninth party congress--two 
months before the cantonal elections, four and one-half months 
before the European elections, and 15 months before the normal 
date of the presidential election--the party of the far right is 
seeing all the indicators of its popularity and credibility move 
from the black into the red, so to speak. 
  The poll conducted by SOFRES [French Opinion Polling 
Company] 
for LE MONDE and RTL [Luxembourg Radio Television system] 
reveals a sharp decline in the attraction that the National 
Front exerts on public opinion. Support for Le Pen's ideas has 
dropped 13 points since the previous comparable poll--published 
in our columns in October 1991--which heralded what might be 
construed as an hour of glory for Le Penism following six months 
of the administration of Edith Cresson. 
  Over a period of 27 months, that support has dropped from 32 
percent--a record--to 19 percent, a rating that takes the Le Pen 
movement back to its level of October 1987 or September 1990. 
The decline in this support had already been recorded in a June 
1993 poll taken by SOFRES for the provincial press[.sup]1[/] 
(Poll taken from 5 to 8 June 1993 of a sample consisting of 
1,000 persons): this poll gave the movement a 23 percent rating. 
The three-year decline is continuing today and reflects--in the 
same proportions--the increasing repulsion felt toward Le Pen's 
theses. 
<H5>  Partisan and Racist </H5>
  Of the voters on the right side of the spectrum, 29 percent 
said they were "in agreement" with Le Pen's ideas--a spectacular 
drop of 25 points from the figure obtained in the October 1991 
poll. Among the voters on the left, the "disagreement"--which 
had reached its lowest point in 1991 (84 percent) and rose to 88 
percent in the June 1993 poll--now stood at 91 percent. 
  Within the electorate as a whole, Le Pen continues to record 
a very high level of disapproval for the positions he has taken 
on all of his favorite issues (see accompanying table). Among 
RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-French Union for Democracy] 
voters, however, he continues to enjoy strong support on three 
issues: immigration, the defense of traditional values, and law 
and order. 
  On the other hand, these same conservative voters do not at 
all appreciate those of Le Pen's positions that concern them 
directly and--in fact--appreciate them much less than does the 
electorate as a whole. For example, his criticism of the two 
majority parties is disapproved by 75 percent of French voters 
as a whole and by 85 percent of the voters of the right, while 
his criticism of the Balladur administration is disapproved by 
76 percent and 84 percent, respectively. 
  An even more serious problem for the president of the 
National Front is the fact that his supporters are confused by 
the attitude he has adopted toward the government--an attitude 
that they feel reflects the absence of a policy line. Whereas 7 
percent of them believe the party of the far right and its 
leader support the administration and 11 percent believe the 
opposite, 68 percent perceive neither support nor hostility (14 
percent have no opinion). 
  When invited to express their preference, one-third of the 
Le 
Pen voters say they would like to see their party support 
Balladur (compared to 14 percent of French voters as a whole) 
and 7 percent would rather have it oppose him (compared to 6 
percent for all French voters), whereas 47 percent express 
indifference (compared to 65 percent for all French voters) and 
14 percent have no opinion (compared to 15 percent for all 
French voters). 
<H5>  Increased Presence in the Field </H5>
  Above all, these figures reflect the existence, among the 
public, of a certain lack of interest--perhaps temporary, 
perhaps definitive--in a party that had dreamed of elevating its 
status in French society, as had been promised by Bruno Megret, 
delegate general of the National Front, during the period 
between the controversy of the Islamic veils in October 1989 and 
the elections of March 1992. 
  Paradoxically, although these figures reflect a decline in 
support and interest on the part of the public vis-a-vis the 
National Front, they are accompanied by an increased attitude of 
apprehension toward that party. Following a period during which 
opinions remained stable (October 1987 to June 1993), more 
French voters than ever (73 percent) now regard Le Pen and his 
movement as a threat to democracy. 
  The Le Pen movement is seeing its influence undermined 
simultaneously by a lack of support on the part of some and by 
mistrust on the part of others. This is all the more disturbing 
for the leader of " French France" in that his party is 
perceived to be more partisan (85 percent compared to 78 percent 
in 1991); more distant from the people (60 percent compared to 
49 percent); more racist (87 percent compared to 81 percent); 
and less capable of governing (86 percent compared to 76 
percent). This general decline, however, is accompanied--in the 
field--by an increased presence of Le Pen cadres in anticipation 
of the cantonal elections of next March. Moreover, Le Pen can 
always tell himself that in October 1987--six months before the 
presidential election in which he obtained 14.39 percent of the 
votes--public support for his ideas was at the same level as 
today. 
<H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5>
<H5>  Figures and Table of Organization </H5>
  The National Front claims to have 80,000 members. A total of 
1,650 de jure delegates (members of the Political Bureau and of 
the Central Committee; members of regional councils; European 
deputies; and departmental secretaries) and officials elected by 
the departmental federations are scheduled to participate in the 
ninth party congress, to be held from 4 to 6 February. 
  The Jurisdictions. The delegates to the party congress 
directly elect the president of the National Front. They also 
vote for the members of the 100-member Central Committee, and 
the president can personally appoint 20 additional delegates. 
The Central Committee then proceeds to elect the Political 
Bureau from a short list submitted by the president of the 
movement. 
  The Leaders. Jean-Marie Le Pen has held the post of 
president 
of the National Front ever since the party was created in 1972, 
and is the sole candidate to succeed himself. He is surrounded 
by a vice president (Dominique Chaboche), a delegate general 
(Bruno Magret), and a secretary general (Carl Lang), all 
appointed by him. This executive bureau is scheduled to be 
"confirmed" in office. The political bureau, which by statute 
consists of 30 members, is to be "enlarged," probably to 35 
members including Samuel Marechal, director of the National 
Front Youth organization. For his part, Roland Gaucher has not 
requested reappointment either to the Central Committee or to 
the Political Bureau. 
  The Elected Officials. The National Front has 10 European 
deputies, who are members of the technical group of the European 
right-wing movements (14 seats). Although the party has no 
deputy or senator in the French Parliament, it won 239 seats in 
the 1992 regional elections--an increase of approximately 100 
seats over the figure for the preceding election in 1986. 
Between the two elections the party lost more than one-quarter 
of its regional elected officials [as published]. It counts in 
its ranks three members of departmental councils (one in La 
Manche, one in Alpes-Maritimes, and one in Bouches-du-Rhone) and 
claims slightly fewer than 1,000 members of municipal councils. 
In a by-election, it lost the only city with a population of 
more than 10,000 that it governed: Saint-Gilles, in Gard 
Department.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Interior Minister Nicola Mancino by </F>
"fe.ge" in Rome on 23 February: "Interior Minister Considers 
Indemnity Unlikely, Urges Excluded Candidates To Trust in Wisdom 
of Judiciary and Urges Court of Cassation To be `Flexible'; 
`Impossible Without Unanimity'; Mancino: `Decree? I Hope 
Not'"--first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "How do you think things are? I am beset 
with problems and troubles over this business of the electoral 
lists. It is an absolute disaster. It is incredible, you 
know...the classic Italian mess." It was 2000 hours [1900 GMT] 
and Nicola Mancino really was struggling with innumerable 
problems in his office at the Interior Ministry. The telephone 
rang continuously, with calls from one "rejected" candidate 
after another. Some were furious and railed against the "unfair 
law." Others appealed for lenience and spoke -- or, rather, 
whispered -- the magic word, indemnity. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Will there be an indemnity, Minister? 
  [Mancino] I do not know what to tell you. I see that there 
is a great deal of talk about it, and that more and more people 
are urging the government to act. But if you want my opinion, 
this is properly a matter for the Court of Cassation. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you mean that there will be no indemnity? 
  [Mancino] I did not say that. Let us look at this logically. 
What should the nature of this indemnity be? And above all, by 
what means should it be introduced? 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Well, actually, it is you who should explain 
that. 
  [Mancino] Precisely, and I will explain: I think that the 
only way is a government decree. But for this to take place two 
preconditions must be met. The first is that such a measure be 
accepted unanimously by the conference of parliamentary group 
leaders. The second is that the government decide to introduce 
an indemnity decree. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So? 
  [Mancino] So I think it is really unlikely that all the 
political forces will be willing to accept the provision. As 
for the government's will to intervene, well, I can tell you 
that not a single meeting has been convened so far in connection 
with the disaster of the candidate lists. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So, if this is the situation, and in view of 
the shortage of time, we could say that the indemnity is dead 
before it is even born. 
  [Mancino] As things stand, I would say so. Be that as it 
may, for the present I will be sure not to propose a decree. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What, then? What kind of election will this 
be? Is it not paradoxical that an election is taking place at a 
time when many political forces have been eliminated entirely 
from whole areas of the country? 
  [Mancino] I do not know what to tell you. Be that as it may, 
I would not be so pessimistic. The decision lies with the Court 
of Cassation, which will certainly decide wisely. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Perhaps but what does "wisely" mean? 
  [Mancino] It means that I think that it will reach a 
flexible 
decision. Look, judging from what I know, I can tell you that 
there are many different reasons why candidates were rejected. 
There are some instances in which I think nothing can be done. 
But in others. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Where do you think nothing can be done? 
  [Mancino] Well, first of all, where there has been outright 
dishonesty. There are instances in which signatures were 
gathered for one list and then submitted in support of another 
list. And of course, there are instances where there was a 
shortage in the number of signatures gathered. Here the 
candidate or list concerned clearly lacked sufficient strength. 
Of course, this may be due to innumerable reasons -- 
bureaucratic impediments, a late start in gathering 
signatures... But I would say that in such instances the Court 
of Cassation has no choice but to turn down those lists and 
candidates. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] In which cases could it be more flexible? 
  [Mancino] Well, there are instances of real errors due to 
negligence, instances of irregularities without any offense 
having been committed. To cite a few examples, a couple of 
Communist Renewal's candidates in Sicily, where the signatures 
submitted were exchanged, though still in support of Communist 
Renewal candidates; or the business of the senatorial 
constituencies of the Italian Popular Party in Lazio, where the 
error was the submission of signatures and candidates on the 
old forms, not the new ones; and also, I would say, where the 
number of signatures exceeded the ceiling set by the law. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Flexibility also in cases where there were 
too many signatures? Do you not think that is going too far? 
  [Mancino] No, but let us be clear about this. There is one 
instance of rejection, affecting the League, in which there are 
only a few dozen signatures more than the set maximum. I can 
understand the fact that gathering a thousand signatures for a 
candidate in a municipality of 2,000 inhabitants is impossible, 
is against the law. But in a major city, or in a constituency of 
100,000 inhabitants, 50 signatures extra. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But basically the entire business is a 
disaster. Be honest: There are parties and candidates here that 
are not even acquainted with the new electoral law. 
  [Mancino] Well, that may perhaps be so. Or perhaps it is 
even worse than that -- that is, a confirmation that this is a 
country that is still lagging behind. Complex laws, a public 
administration that functions badly, and a permanently complex 
relationship between the citizens and the administration. Just 
as I was saying, a country that is lagging behind.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F>
Bossi by Daniele Vimercati in Rome; date not given: "Bossi: 
`Beware the Wrath of the North'"--first paragraph is IL GIORNALE 
introduction] 
  [Text] "Italy faces a clear-cut alternative: the League in 
government or secession." Between one election rally and 
another -- this evening he will be in Brescia -- Umberto Bossi 
vents the bad temper caused by the troubled events leading up to 
the election and sets out his anxieties regarding the next 
parliamentary term. The deep north resounds with the cry of 
pain raised by the League's hard-liners, who will not swallow 
the alliance with Berlusconi and "contamination" by the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement]. Opinion polls cast doubt on the 
League leadership in the north, where it is prey to Forza 
Italia. But what Bossi fears more than the forecasts is a 
"restoration by stealth," which would give rise to "a grave 
danger, the break-up of the state." 
  [Vimercati] Bossi, what are you up to? Changing the stakes? 
They said it was the League that was pursuing the break up of 
the state. 
  [Bossi] I am getting tired of repeating this: Federalism is 
the opposite of secession, it is an institutional buffer that 
prevents a divorce between areas in the country that differ too 
widely. 
  [Vimercati] Okay, but what do you mean by "either in 
government or secession?" 
  [Bossi] I live among the people, I listen to them. And I 
notice that there is a widespread desire to go it alone in the 
north. The people will not agree to turn back, to watch while 
the centralist state is restored. And if victory were to escape 
the League, or if it were to remain outside government, a 
centralist comeback would be inevitable. The north would have 
no part in it, and the result would be a break up. 
  [Vimercati] What could happen, in concrete terms? 
  [Bossi] It is not for me to say, but there are a lot of 
people in the north who will not agree to go back to the old 
system, to pay new taxes to cover the cost of an unacceptable 
political system based on bribes. The north cannot waste this 
opportunity, it is ready to go to any lengths. And the south, 
too, in my opinion, will go back to its old godfathers or will 
try to break its links with the state unless it obtains 
development and employment. 
  [Vimercati] So you maintain that a vote for the 
liberal-democratic alignment is a vote for a united Italy? 
  [Bossi] For a united, federalist Italy. But a win for the 
freedom alignment is not enough. Within the alignment, it is 
the League that must win, otherwise, if the recycled politicians 
in Forza Italia and the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] were 
to gain the upper hand, the mechanism of change could be brought 
to a standstill. 
  [Vimercati] You have a single symbol and a joint manifesto, 
and yet you refer to the Berlusconians as "recycled." Do you 
think that is polite? 
  [Bossi] I call things as I see them. I will not renege on 
the alliance with Forza Italia, even though I understand the 
distress that this inflicts on the League members, the people 
who have sacrificed themselves for the revolution. But I 
cannot, and will not, hide the fact that the League is one thing 
and Forza Italia is another. The League was the force behind 
the revolution, the locomotive for change. The others have 
jumped onto a moving train. If the League wins and goes into 
government, it will be another, perhaps decisive, step forward 
for us. If Forza Italia wins, or the CCD, or the Right, there 
is a danger that the train will stop, or even derail. 
  [Vimercati] Be honest, now: Is there a leadership problem in 
the liberal-democratic alignment? 
  [Bossi] After the election, what will count will be numbers 
in parliament. I am certain that the League will have the 
strongest and most united parliamentary party. We shall be a 
force to be reckoned with in government, and I have some 
surprises up my sleeve, a secret weapon. 
  [Vimercati] Perhaps you want to emulate the socialists? 
  [Bossi] This is no laughing matter; the league has been the 
socialists' grave. We shall govern with Forza Italia and anyone 
else who accepts our manifesto. Of course, I should have 
preferred the League to stand alone against the rest, but that 
way we would have left Berlusconi in the hands of his inventors, 
in other words the Christian democrats. 
  [Vimercati] Are you sure the DC [Christian Democratic Party] 
welcomed Forza Italia's intervention? 
  [Bossi] Let us say that the Christian democrats intended 
Berlusconi to represent the good League member who would eat up 
the evil League: the great recycler who, together with Segni, 
would put a nice bag of votes into the DC's basket. But we 
repulsed poor Segni with losses and broke up the 
Segni-Martinazzoli-Berlusconi axis, bringing the latter over to 
the freedom alignment. 
  [Vimercati] So why are you distancing yourselves from him? 
  [Bossi] Because the misinformation put about by the regime 
is 
confusing the voters and trying to make them forget which is the 
true motive force for change. There is an attempt to bring 
political debate back into the confines of a false right-left 
confrontation, when the real choice is between statism and the 
free market, federalism and centralism. The more the League 
wins, the greater will be the triumph of freedom: political, 
economic, and institutional freedom. 
  [Vimercati] Do you not think that Berlusconi shares these 
slogans? 
  [Bossi] We shall see when he is put to the test, when, for 
instance, we call for the antitrust rules to be applied to 
television. 
  [Vimercati] Do you intend to join forces with the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] in the attack on Fininvest? 
  [Bossi] The very idea! The private television companies have 
been the saving of pluralism in television, but we are against 
monopolies, and even duopolies. 
  [Vimercati] You have recently gone back to attacking the 
public prosecutors. Why? 
  [Bossi] I am afraid they might sway the election campaign, 
that they might try to prevent the emergence of a strong 
political power capable of extending the arm of the law to the 
caste of the examining magistrates as well. Even those who don 
gowns must go to jail when they commit mistakes. Diego Curto is 
the only one to suffer this fate so far. A single arrest is not 
much in a category that has always lived in the shadow of the 
parties. 
  [Vimercati] Do you not fear that calling for a turn of the 
screw on the examining magistrates will make you unpopular? 
  [Bossi] Turning of the screw? No, it is only a matter of 
balance. And I guarantee that there will be no more contact 
between the judiciary and the parties in federal Italy. That is 
why not even one of our candidates is gowned.

<F P=106> [Guido Passalacqua report: "Bossi Versus His Ally: </F>
`Silvio, I Will Beat You'"] 
  [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] Addressing about a 
thousand shivering people, [Northern League leader] Bossi did 
not beat about the bush when speaking of his ally, [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi: "Within the freedom alignment it is 
necessary to begin the struggle for hegemony. And hegemony 
cannot belong to Forza Italia, which was created to destroy the 
League. It belongs to the League." Was this a trick move 
designed to reassure the grassroots or an open declaration of 
war? 
  In his interview on "Mixer" [television program] Berlusconi 
described Bossi as a "paradoxical and coarse" politician, so 
Bossi replied by saying that Forza Italia was created months ago 
in order to attack the League. That was all the audience wanted 
to hear, and at the end they overwhelmed him with requests for 
autographs, but also with pressing questions such as, "Umberto, 
why did you ally with Berlusconi?" 
  Bossi, who is well acquainted with his supporters' feelings 
and sympathies, was combative and talked about past months when 
the League was in difficulties: "Another operation was in 
progress -- that of Forza Italia. We realized that it would be 
a factor which, in the hands of a businessman of the north, 
could steal votes from the League and add them to those of the 
DC [Christian Democratic Party] and of that other Christian 
democrat, Segni. That was the plan -- to hit the League, to 
smash it." It was the theory of the grand conspiracy against 
the League, in which Forza Italia was supposedly involved, at 
least at the start. Bossi described it clearly for the first 
time. The bombshell was sparked off by the "gift" of the 200 
million lire. "It was [investigating magistrate] Di Pietro who 
caused it to explode, prompted by Sama, the man connected with 
the great and mysterious authority that stands above politics in 
this country." His reference was to big finance, to Mediobanca 
[Financial Credit Bank], to those who do not want "any of the 
alignments to win, because they want to remain in command." If 
Forza Italia was involved in this "conspiracy," how does Bossi 
explain his subsequent alliance with Berlusconi? "The plan did 
not succeed," the League withstood it, and so, "against its will 
-- since it was formed in order to steal votes from the League 
-- Forza Italia found itself trapped in our net and will serve 
to destroy the DC." 
  This was a veritable mortal triple jump, and to make it more 
comprehensible to his voters, Bossi raised his tone: "At one 
point we were in great difficulties. We had arrayed against us 
all of the television stations, which were in the hands of the 
party system and of the sons of the party dictatorship." And, 
Bossi implied, these television stations included those of 
Berlusconi. 
  Bossi recounted to the audience, in a loud voice, the story 
of a marriage not for love but of convenience, a marriage with 
someone who until recently was conspiring against the League, 
and in which the marriage contract will have to be revised after 
the elections. He drew applause when he said: "I say that the 
League will govern this country and that there will be a 
struggle within the Pole for Freedom and that we will grant 
hegemony to the League." 
  While Berlusconi has expressed his esteem for [former 
Italian 
Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi, Bossi shouted: "I claim that 
the League destroyed Bettino Craxi." While Berlusconi is 
suspicious of public spending, Bossi repeated that "Craxi and 
[former Christian Democrat Prime Minister] Andreotti, like South 
American dictators, wanted inflation in order to destroy the 
public debt; it is a shame that they destroyed the economy." At 
the end of the rally, asked whether his speech should be 
interpreted as a declaration of war within the freedom 
alignment, he replied tersely: "The truth is the truth, even if 
it is uncomfortable." He added: "Things will not turn out as 
the opinion polls say. Berlusconi will not be the winner in the 
elections; it will be the League. We will be dominant. 
Berlusconi -- born of the DC in order to destroy the League -- 
has become involved in a mechanism that will destroy the DC."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fini Attacks: `The League Will </F>
Collapse in the Elections'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi? "He is 
unreliable -- a regional leader destined to disappear as soon as 
he tries to acquire a national dimension." The League? "It will 
collapse in the elections." These words are worthy of a sworn 
enemy, but they were actually spoken by [National Alliance (AN) 
leader] Gianfranco Fini, the League's ally in the elections. 
There is constant strife within the alignment clustered around 
[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. While Bossi, for his part, 
attacked the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] from Milan, 
vindicating the League's hegemony within the right-wing 
alignment, the AN leader fired a volley against the Senator 
[Bossi nickname] in an interview with MILANO FINANZA. 
  "Bossi has no concrete arguments," Fini said in the 
interview. "He can shout when he stands there alone, claiming to 
be a tough guy, but when it comes to moving on from the shouting 
stage to the reasoning stage, he becomes unreliable and is not 
recognized as a leader." 
  Fini was almost laughing at the League's political chances 
in 
the future: "Bossi had to join an alliance with Berlusconi 
because he knew that Forza Italia would take half of the votes 
away from him. The League could hold its ground," Fini added, 
"as long as it presented itself as an absolute novelty. 
However, the real novelty today is Forza Italia -- and, in the 
north, the AN may also constitute a novelty." The AN leader 
went on to give his grim forecasts of the League's electoral 
results: "I am convinced that, in the proportional voting, the 
League will be deserted by its supporters in favor of us and 
Forza Italia." 
  However, Fini was predicting a difficult outcome for the 
political situation after the elections: "I do not think that 
an overwhelming victory of any of the contending forces is 
likely. It could happen, of course, but I do not believe it 
will. Instead, we risk ending up with a parliament in which 
those with the least support, namely [Italian Popular Party 
(PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, 
will wield a much greater power -- the power of restraint." 
This scenario reminded Fini of the situation in past years: 
"It is the PSI's [Italian Socialist Party] old power scheme, 
typical of a proportional voting system. It is also the best 
way to set off on the wrong foot, but unfortunately this is 
exactly what may happen." 
  Finally, according to Fini, [President] Scalfaro will have 
to 
resign as soon as the elections are over: "The last president 
of the First Republic cannot be the first of the Second 
Republic, and this is so irrespective of the illegal funding and 
the Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] affair."

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Social Movement Secretary Gianfranco </F>
Fini by "a.lo."in Rome; date not given: "`Exclude Us From 
Palazzo Chigi? It is up to The Voters to Decide'" -- first 
three paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- [League Secretary] Bossi wants to eat up 
Forza Italia and restore the League's supremacy, as long as he 
still has time. [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is being 
snobbish. He joined forces with the Bandwagon [League 
nickname], but is keen to explain that the only thing he and the 
Senator [Bossi nickname] have in common is the purity of their 
Lombard origins, which amounts to very little, not to say 
practically nothing. A prudent Knight [Berlusconi nickname] 
would like to use the National Alliance [AN] as an "external" 
prop for a possible government formed jointly with the Bandwagon 
-- a fairly close prop, but not too close. Fini, for his part, 
is keeping Bossi at a distance, thus cordially returning the 
latter's feelings. He defined Bossi as being "unreliable," in 
addition to geographically limited. 
  Is strife not excessive within the liberty-inspired 
alignment? Gianfranco Fini, as one of its members, asserted that 
the exchange of poisons was "physiological" in nature. Will the 
AN actually be excluded from the government in the event of a 
victory, as Berlusconi predicts? 
  The MSI [Italian Social Movement] secretary dodged the 
provocation, but his reply was also a warning of a sort: "It is 
the voters who are dealing the cards." Voters, not Bossi or 
Berlusconi. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Deputy Fini, you are saying that the center 
is crumbling to pieces, and that the right is the only "national 
and winning" alternative to the left. Would you agree that 
there is a bit too much tension among you? What sort of 
impression are you giving the voters? 
  [Fini] Disagreements are typical of electoral campaigns. 
There has been a tough exchange of rhetoric between Bossi and 
Berlusconi, but not everything is going smoothly for [PDS 
Secretary] Occhetto and [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti 
either. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is the exchange of pleasantries nbetween you 
and Bossi also part of the preelection ritual dance? 
  [Fini] No, the situation is different between us. It is not 
just by chance that we decided to run in all the northern 
constituencies. Bossi has ignored two problems that we 
initially posed to him: national identity and the need for 
solidarity within the country. By doing so, he has taken on a 
very serious responsibility. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] How can such a troubled alliance lead to any 
positive results? 
  [Fini] It is up to the voters to decide. Strong support for 
the AN will enable us to uphold the principles we believe in. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] [Northern League lower house floor leader] 
Roberto Maroni was already complacently commenting on the 
Berlusconian scenario whereby you would be propping up the 
government from the outside. 
  [Fini] I am totally indifferent to what Maroni thinks or 
says. I see no difficulty. We have not entered into any 
agreement with the League. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] However, it is Berlusconi who envisages you 
outside. 
  [Fini] There are no issues capable of causing tough 
rhetoric. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] The Knight, however, seems to be a bit 
embarrassed by certain candidates such as Bontempo, known as the 
federalist. 
  [Fini] Berlusconi knows very well that giving birth to an 
electoral alliance means joining forces. I believe that 
Berlusconi's possible comments or reservations simply stem from 
the current competitive mood. The proportional voting system 
automatically pushes parties to safeguard their own identity in 
relation to their allies. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] When push comes to shove, will you be inside 
or outside the government? 
  [Fini] I do not think anyone can now afford to rush ahead of 
events.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mastella Flunks Bossi and Fini"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Things are stirring also within the 
liberal-democratic alignment, which is preparing to "designate" 
a prime minister to lead the next government. According to 
Clemente Mastella, leader of the Christian Democratic Center 
[CCD], among the moderates' leaders only [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi is qualified to aspire to the premiership. 
  In an interview with the MILANO FINANZA daily, Mastella 
stated: "There is no chance of [League Secretary] Bossi becoming 
prime minister. He has no national standing, he is too much of 
a local leader to become prime minister." Mastella said that, 
if conditions were appropriate after the elections, he "would 
not be against Berlusconi" becoming prime minister. The CCD 
leader did not believe that [Italian Social Movement (MSI) 
leader] Gianfranco Fini -- Forza Italia's other ally in the 
south -- would make a good prime minister either. The MSI 
leader, Mastella said, "must still come to terms with his past. 
He may succeed in becoming the government's right wing, but not 
the coalition's leader." 
  Replying to those who criticized the composition of the 
CCD's 
electoral lists for including member of the old political 
establishment, the former DC member said: "There are people 
with a long political experience among our allies too. Anyway, 
I see no great lists being put forward by Forza Italia or by the 
other forces. There are no Napoleons or Leonardos among them." 
Mastella criticized the League and athe National Alliance [AN] 
for having (rhetorically) invited President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
to resign after the elections. "The fact that there will be a 
new parliament does not matter. Otherwise, apart from 
Scalfaro," Mastella remarked, "we should also throw away all the 
laws passed by this parliament."

<F P=106> [Interview with Communist Renewal leader Fausto Bertinotti </F>
by Marco Panara in Rome; date not given: "My Model Is Robin 
Hood: Take From the Rich and Give to the Poor"] 
  [Excerpt] [paragraph omitted] [Panara] What exactly are you 
proposing? 
  [Bertinotti] The idea is to produce an ordinary property tax 
in such a way that all income is taxed, with an exemption 
threshold excluding the first 150 or 200 million lire [L] of 
treasury bills and the primary residence. 
  [Panara] But do you realize that, in launching this idea in 
the middle of an election campaign in which taxation is the 
major issue, you are stirring up a hornets' nest? 
  [Bertinotti] I do not understand the reason for the 
controversy. This proposal has been part of the traditional 
position of the Left since the sixties, and has become relevant 
nowadays given the heavy tax burden on workers. Their earnings 
represent more or less half of all earnings while they pay three 
quarters of all personal income tax. It is as if the tax 
authorities were playing Robin Hood in reverse, taking from the 
poor to give to the rich, and we want to bring all this back 
into balance. 
  [Panara] You know that treasury bills can be taxed in three 
ways: through a fixed withholding on the income, as is done 
today; by including the income in the tax return and subjecting 
it to progressive taxation; or through a property tax. Why have 
you gone for a property tax? 
  [Bertinotti] My intention was not to offer a technical 
solution to the problem. We are very open to any further 
detailed suggestions. What I am attempting do is to highlight 
the disparities between the tax treatment of incomes. Obviously 
a property tax requires that the bills be registered, but it 
does not seem to me improper for the state to ask about property 
held by taxpayers. [Bertinotti ends] 
  Bertinotti is calm, as if unaware that he has rocked a 
weighty container, unexpectedly rocking the progressive ship and 
without warning the rest of the crew. 
  [Panara] But why, if your intention is to tax financial 
income, did you not talk about financial income, but about 
treasury bills, the sacred word? 
  [Bertinotti] Because one has to move gradually, and since we 
have to begin with something, we decided to begin with the most 
important thing. 
  [Panara] It seems to me difficult to do these things in 
stages. If one begins by taxing treasury bills, the first and 
inevitable consequence is that everyone will sell their treasury 
bills and buy something else. The result is a useless and very 
dangerous earthquake. 
  [Bertinotti] What we want to do is to rebalance the tax 
burden by including all income, and not just treasury bills. We 
mentioned treasury bills in order to kindle reflection on the 
problem. 
  [Panara] But the Renewal is part of an alignment. Why did 
you go it alone? 
  [Bertinotti] We are not making an exclusive out of this 
proposal, we are seeking solely to push the progressive 
alignment to analyze this proposal, nothing more. 
  [Panara] But to propose a new tax just when the right is 
building up consensus on a tax reduction. 
  [Bertinotti] We are proposing a different balancing of the 
tax burden; we say that our position exemplifies a line which is 
different from that of the Right. We say: "Pay less, but pay on 
all income." 
  [Panara] It seems that while your allies are working to 
conquer the center, you are doing everything possible to throw 
them off balance. 
  [Bertinotti] It seems to me that the alignment is working in 
particular to lose the social sector of the left, whose votes 
and enthusiasm it needs to reconquer and without which this 
battle cannot be won. And it is precisely this rush to the 
center, this alignment which is opening up to the moderates. 
The Right, what is it, basically, but an alignment which is 
tending to become a mass reactionary phenomenon based on fear 
and uncertainty? 
  [Panara] And then? 
  [Bertinotti] And then we have to reassure the Fiat workers, 
who are afraid. 
  [Panara] By saying that the agreement which has just been 
reached should not be signed? 
  [Bertinotti] Yes, I believe that if, in factory-level 
consultations, the agreement were to be rejected, this would be 
a positive thing, because workers could move ahead in two areas. 
The first is to change Fiat's attitude, which from the outset 
has been: Industrial policy decision are mine but the social 
consequences are for the state. The second is to avoid the 
social "shock absorbers" having the effect of eliminating any 
possibility of intervention by workers in the restructuring 
process. With this agreement the shock absorbers have been 
applied in such a way as to divide workers into a number of 
sections unable to communicate between themselves. This is an 
agreement concluded within the culture of the eighties, whereas 
the situation demands inventiveness, novelty. [Bertinotti ends] 
  Bertinotti reflects for a moment: "This does not seem to me 
such an extremist line of argument." 
  [Panara] But tell me one thing. Do you really think that 
this system of fighting separately in order to achieve a unified 
victory can work? 
  [Bertinotti] We need to learn to reconcile dissent and 
unity. 
We have a common basis and then everyone advances his proposals. 
The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] has presented its 
program, which does not please a lot of people, there are 
candidates for whom perhaps one does not vote gladly, there are 
different ideas on certain points, but the elements of unity are 
there and it is these which remain. For the rest we will see 
what consensus we manage to build. 
  [Panara] In a Turin constituency where the Renewal is 
strong, 
Gino Giugni, the minister who put together the Fiat agreement 
which you do not like, is standing. Will you vote for him? 
  [Bertinotti] It is here that Republican discipline comes 
into 
play; just as we do not silence dissent, in the same way this 
dissent does not eliminate the reasons for a united battle 
against the right. I will vote for Giugni, certainly I will 
vote for him.

<F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the </F>
Left secretary, by Marco Panara in London on 24 February: 
"Occhetto in the Capitalist Kingdom"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Panara] What do you think, Mr. 
Secretary, of the story about taxing treasury bills? 
  [Occhetto] If we form the next government we will do so on 
the basis of an agreed platform, and we will not form a 
government with anybody who wants to include a tax on treasury 
bills in the platform. Do you also want to know why? Because we 
believe that taxing treasury bills would be a mistake, would 
discourage investment, and would disrupt the state's finances. 
As a result of all this, we have no intention of taxing 
treasury bills. 
  [Panara] What about NATO, which [Communist Renewal leader] 
Bertinotti is saying Italy should leave? 
  [Occhetto] This debate about whether we should stay in NATO 
or leave is really old hat. [Former Communist Party leader] 
Berlinguer himself, however, said that NATO was an umbrella 
organization to protect freedom. On Monday [28 February] we 
will be going to Brussels to meet NATO's top officials. At this 
meeting -- the first of its kind -- we will be discussing global 
problems and NATO's role in solving them. 
  [Panara] What is your opinion of Bertinotti? 
  [Occhetto] Clearly, the battle waged by Communist Renewal is 
closely linked to party issues. If they think that they will 
win votes in this way -- which I very much doubt -- let them 
carry on as they please. 
  [Panara] Even if the votes that they may win by doing so 
were 
considerably fewer than those they may cause the progressive 
coalition to lose? 
  [Occhetto] I trust that this will not be the case, because 
we 
still have the capability to speak to the country at grassroots 
level. We are a real presence, as shown by experience in the 
last few days. We have seen that wherever there are real men 
made of flesh and bone, the electoral lists are successfully, 
but where there are only TV spots and hot air, they are 
unsuccessful. [Occhetto ends] 
  Occhetto cuts short: "Look here, this electoral campaign can 
be described as Occhetto versus [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi, not Occhetto versus Bertinotti." 
  We went on to discuss the issue of the restructuring of 
industry, a process capable of causing massive redundancies. 
  "We are in favor of defending productive activities at any 
price," Occhetto said. "We want to defend each citizen's right 
to work. The time for a purely defensive battle has come to an 
end; we are now aiming to enable people to move from one job to 
another, without increasing the public debt, but rather, by 
mobilizing private funds and the state's existing resources."

on East Timor denouncing a second massacre by Indonesian troops. 
The prime minister was speaking at a news conference under way 
at Sao Bento. Cavaco Silva is giving a joint news conference 
with his Israeli counterpart. Raquel Abecassis reports: 
  [Abecassis] This was the first question Cavaco Silva had to 
answer. He spoke without any problem about the documentary 
shown on television on the second massacre in East Timor: 
  [Begin Cavaco recording] Once again we receive shocking 
images of Indonesia's behavior in Timor. We hope that these 
images will help the international community to be even more 
aware of the need to pressure the Indonesian Government as much 
as possible to respect human rights in the territory. I can 
also say that we were already working with information very 
similar to that revealed yesterday, information we have received 
from the resistance [words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Twenty-four hours after the showing of the 
documentary on the second massacre perpetrated on the survivors 
of the Santa Cruz massacre, the reactions are still coming in. 
[President] Mario Soares said this evening that he was saddened 
but not at all surprised by the brutality of the Indonesians. 
The president of the republic said that he hopes the matter 
will now receive greater attention from all those who were 
beginning to forget Timor: 
  [Begin Soares recording] I was very shocked, once again, 
although from Indonesia I expect anything. Indonesia is ruled 
by a brutal dictatorship and anything they may do in the way of 
violence, oppression, and crimes against the individual 
surprises me not at all. So I was saddened by what happened 
there and was shown in those pictures, but on the other hand I 
found it an extraordinary service rendered to the cause of East 
Timor by those fearless reporters who managed to capture a 
reality that will jolt the conscience of the entire world. And 
I hope that today many people who were indifferent to the cause 
of East Timor will feel the duty to protest and commit 
themselves to the patriots who in East Timor are fighting for 
the independence of their country. [end recording] [passage

  [Text] There are clear signs that relations between Lisbon 
and Tel Aviv are improving. Miguel Coimbra reports: 
  [Coimbra] Portugal has had diplomatic relations with Israel 
since 1977, but it only opened an embassy in Tel Aviv two and a 
half years ago. Since then there have been successive high 
level visits and meetings between leaders of both countries. 
These meetings have resulted in excellent cooperation relations 
and in the development of a variety of activities -- 
entrepreneurial, scientific, and commercial. Israel has become 
in the last few years, OECD countries aside, Portugal's second 
trading partner, after Angola. The good relations are also 
demonstrated by the two direct weekly flights between Portugal 
and Israel and by an accord to abolish entry visas for citizens 
of the two countries. In addition to strengthening bilateral 
understanding, the two governments are at the moment working on 
the consolidation of cooperation on a trilateral level, 
including the PALOP's [Lusophone African countries], and on an 
international level with a focus on the Middle East peace 
process and on a new economic accord between Israel and the 
European Union.

<F P=106> [Ritva Pesola report: "The Baltic Region Aims To Become an </F>
Economic Growth Center"] 
  [Text] The Baltic region may become an economic power base 
comparable to France, Italy, or Britain, says Swedish Professor 
Carl Frediksson. 
  Fredriksson reviewed a study commissioned by the state of 
Schleswig-Holstein on future opportunities for the Baltic region. 
  Fredriksson, speaking at a symposium held in Kiel in 
January, 
pointed out that the Baltic sphere of influence encompasses 10 
countries with a population of 50 million. This region 
represents a purchasing power greater than China's and 
approximately the same as that of France, Italy, or Britain. 
  The study was carried out by the EuroFutures Institute, 
headed by Fredriksson. It reviews the basic factors for future 
opportunities in the Baltic region in terms of population, 
buying power, number of large enterprises, volume of internal 
trade, level of university education, research and development, 
infrastructure, and airline services. The study also reviews 
the number of investments and investment growth in the Baltic 
region. 
  But hard work is required if the opportunities in the Baltic 
region are not to remain mere projects. The coastal states must 
therefore begin to act and commit themselves to the exploitation 
of existing opportunities and the development of new ones. 
  EuroFutures points out that the profile of the region must 
be 
strengthened. The Baltic region must become better known to the 
economic and political decisionmakers in order to attract 
foreign investment. The infrastructure must be reinforced and 
the results from research and development work and innovations 
must be converted to growth-positive enterpreneurial activities. 
  Fredriksson thinks that the activities of universities and 
research institutes should be coordinated with the prospect of 
creating a couple of dozen internationally recognized know-how 
centers. 
<H5>  Schleswig-Holstein Is Active </H5>
  The government of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein 
has, 
since the late 1980's, been very active in promoting the Baltic 
region as a future growth area in Europe. 
  Schleswig-Holstein has, among other things, taken the 
initiative of creating a "Baltic program" for the European Union. 
  Heide Simonis, Schleswig-Holstein's prime minister, who 
addressed the symposium, said that the Baltic region will become 
a European fringe area unless we take concrete steps and join 
forces to consolidate its development. 
  Simonis pointed out that the region stands up well to 
comparison. The levels of education, technology, and research 
are high. The Baltic has a lively commercial traffic and plays 
an active part in world trade. Internal trade alone represents 
6 percent of world trade. 
  Schleswig-Holstein is a federal state with a population of 
2.6 million, which has succeeded extremely well in making use of 
the various support programs of the European Union. A study, 
completed last year by the Satakunta-Liitto, indicates how well 
Schleswig-Holstein has handled this opportunity. 
  The province of Vaasa has kept active contact with 
Schleswig-Holstein. Cooperation began thanks to contacts 
between Vaasa and its twin city Kiel.

<F P=106> [Emily von Sydow report: "EU Made New Offer on Regional </F>
Support"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- There was movement in the negotiations 
on regional support for the Nordic applicant nations yesterday 
morning. And as far as Finland is concerned it hit the jackpot 
with regard to Aland. The EU [European Union] accepts all the 
opt-outs that Finland has demanded for Aland. 
  This means that the Alanders can continue to limit the right 
to buy property and to set up businesses to citizens of Aland. 
Aland will also be able to keep tax-free sales on its ferries 
after 1999, which means that in this respect Aland will be 
regarded as a third country in relation to the EU. 
  "This is something very positive. This means that the 
Lagting [Aland legislative assembly] can accept the protocol and 
that Aland can also become a member of the EU," said department 
chief Peter Lindback who represented Aland in the negotiations 
with the EU. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen also said that 
Finland has given a guarantee that Aland will not become a tax 
haven, despite its special status. 
  Yesterday morning the 12 member countries reached agreement 
on a common line on support funds for the northern regions. In 
the past, the member countries have been unwilling to classify 
the northern regions as as poor and backward as the poorest 
regions in the EU that are classified as Objective 1 regions. A 
simple name change for the fund cut through the Gordian knot. 
  Some ECU170 million from the EU's joint coffers -- that is, 
in part from the candidate nations themselves -- are included in 
the projected Objective 6 fund. This is around 10 percent less 
than the proposal of the Commission, which in its first proposal 
classified these same regions as Objective 1 regions -- that is, 
regions with backward development and with an average income 
below 75 percent of the average income in the EU. 
  Instead of calling these regions Objective 1 regions, the EU 
wants to put them in a completely new category -- Objective 6. 
Isolation is the single criterion for entitlement to money from 
this fund that covers the eastern parts of Finland, the inland 
areas of Norrland in Sweden, and the four northernmost Norwegian 
provinces. There must be less than eight inhabitants per square 
kilometer for regions to qualify for these funds. Only 
Burgenland in applicant country Austria is classified as an 
Objective 1 region. 
  The other funds cover northern agriculture. Here member 
countries have agreed on the following criteria for approving 
national support -- that is, money that will come from the 
Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish taxpayers: The agricultural 
region must lie north of the 62d parallel, it must be sparsely 
populated (less than 10 inhabitants per square kilometer, the 
area cultivated must be less than 10 percent of the region, and 
of this 10 percent a maximum of 20 percent can be devoted to the 
cultivation of grain. 
  French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said that 
regional support must be formulated in such a way that a 
precedent is not set for other regions in the EU. The 
agricultural support for the northern regions must also be 
structured in such a way that it does not give an unfair 
advantage over the farmers in member nations. 
  When the discussions were in difficulty on Monday [21 
February] evening the Spaniards put forward a list of possible 
names for the new funds -- a list that helped to lighten the 
atmosphere: THOR, ODIN, VIKING, AMIGOS, and FIORD. These 
abbreviations are to be read as Territorial Help for Overfrozen 
Regions, One-Off Donation to the Icy North, Very Important Kitty 
for Implementing Nordic Goals, Arctic Most Isolated Genuinely 
Overfrozen System, and finally Financial Instrument for 
Overfrozen Regions' Demands. 
  Agreement was reached instead on the less flamboyant 
Objective 6. The reactions from Swedish circles were positive: 
  "This is an indication of an opening," Agriculture Minister 
Karl-Erik Olsson said, "but a lot still remains to be done." 
  European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel also said that he 
was very satisfied after the round of negotiations, but he also 
noted that Sweden's demand for a phasing-in of payments to the 
EU's coffers was given an icy reception. 
  "This is something that is bound to be resolved at the very 
end," a well-briefed source at the Council of Ministers said. 
  After yesterday's discussions Finland and Sweden are in a 
very good position on the eve of the final spurt in the 
negotiations. The major problems lie with Austria, which is 
demanding that it be allowed to keep the agreement on transit 
traffic that already exists between the EU and Austria. 
However, the EU takes the view that this agreement is a barrier 
to trade since it makes transit through the Alpine country more 
difficult. 
  "But the Swiss referendum last Sunday [20 February] changed 
the situation somewhat," Lamassoure said at a news briefing. 
  The Swiss voted to stop all foreign transit traffic through 
the country -- which will mean large increases in costs 
especially for Germany and Italy, which are used to transporting 
their goods through Switzerland. 
  The Austrians pointed to the position of the Swiss as an 
argument for their country's position. 
  The other very difficult question is to do with Norway's 
position in the fisheries negotiations. The Norwegians want 
full market access -- something to which the French and the 
British are opposed, out of a fear of dumping. At the same time 
the Norwegians do not want to give away any fishing waters -- 
something that is unacceptable to Spain.

<F P=106> ["EvS" report: "Finland Dissatisfied With New EU </F>
Classification"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Finland showed its great 
dissatisfaction with the new EU [European Union] regional 
support classification and will continue to argue that large 
areas of Finland need Objective 1 support instead of the 
Objective 6 support which was proposed by the EU yesterday. 
  The EU's proposal in the field of agriculture was also 
completely unacceptable to Finland: 
  "Only 5 percent of agricultural production would be 
covered," 
Under Secretary of State Veli Sundback said. 
  Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto said that the criteria for 
receiving agricultural support are so numerous and wide-ranging 
that Finland cannot accept the proposal, but will return with a 
counterbid at the weekend after careful study. 
  In some areas, however, Haavisto was able to note forward 
movement. A special protocol protecting the Lapps' way of life 
was accepted by the EU. Foreigners will be granted the right to 
buy leisure homes in Finland. The issue of herring fishing in 
the Baltic Sea has also been resolved. This means that EU 
citizens will be able to fish herring for use as mink and fox 
food, with a promise of a review and an investigation of herring 
stocks after three years. However, the issue of regulations 
covering travelers remains to be resolved.

<F P=106> [Jorma Poysa report: "GDP Drops to 1986 Level"] </F>
  [Text] Finland's gross domestic product shrank last year by 
2.6 percent. Total production was therefore actually 13 percent 
lower than in the best year, 1990, and on the same level as in 
1986. This is shown in the preliminary figures published by the 
Central Statistical Office yesterday. However, the drop in GDP 
was clearly slower at the end than in early part of the year. 
The figures only show a halt in a long downhill trend in 
overall production rather than a decent recovery, Heikki Salmi, 
deputy manager of the Central Statistical Office, said: "I 
would still wait two to three months before interpreting this as 
the beginning of a recovery." 
  Salmi points out that all December figures, except for those 
on unemployment, have yet to be confirmed. Production figures 
arrive next week, but the December figures on trade and 
construction are still about a month away. Salmi thinks that a 
consolidated upward trend can only be confirmed when the figures 
for January become available. 
<H5>  Signs of Upturn </H5>
  Salmi points out that expectations of an upturn are now 
unusually high. Business-cycle expectations within the industry 
are approaching an all-time high and similarly positive 
expectations can also be seen at consumer level. Conditions for 
recovery have improved at domestic as well as international 
level. 
  The debt volume has shrunk considerably at both consumer and 
enterprise levels. Consumer household debt has dropped over 10 
percent from its peak figure at the of the 1980's. This 
indicates that, on the basis of current interest rates, 
consumers should be able to afford new loans for housing and 
consumption. But last year's all-time high in savings indicates 
that people were not tending to borrow money. Courage may grow 
when there is a halt in the unemployment trend. 
  The financing surplus in the enterprise sector was 7 billion 
Finnish markkas last year. 
  "The enterprises should be able to afford investments, but 
whether they have the will is another question," Salmi added. 
  But interest in investments is spurred by continuing growth 
in the export industry and last year's positive upturn in other 
industrial sectors. There was also an upturn in the transport 
and communication sectors at the end of the year. Salmi thinks 
that the "taxi index," i.e., the rate of taxi drivers' actual 
service time, is another recovery indicator. 
  Statisticians believe that GDP must be positive for at least 
three months before an upturn can be confirmed. 
<H5>  Energy, Financing, and Communications Begin To Grow </H5>
  The forest and metal industries, which continued to grow 
vigorously last year, have been joined by the sectors of energy 
production, financing, and communications. The decline in 
construction was, on the other hand, even greater than the year 
before. 
  An upward turn in construction used to be one of the 
clearest 
indicators of a recovery. Statistics Manager Markku Suur-Kujala 
believes that the recovery pattern in construction may now be 
different: Residential building picks up, but the construction 
of such things as shopping centers will hardly increase for a 
while. 
<H5>  Exports Already at Record Level </H5>
  The export of goods and services grew by 17 percent last 
year. Exports as a proportion of GDP rose to almost 34 percent, 
higher than ever before. Imports during the same period stayed 
at 1992 level. 
  Domestic demand decreased last year by more than 7 percent. 
Investments dropped by more than 18 percent to keep the 
investment level down to a record low of 15 percent. Private 
consumption fell by just below 5 percent and public consumption 
a little less than 6 percent. 
  The wage volume of the national economy dropped 7 percent 
due 
to growing unemployment. Capital and entrepreneurial income 
rose by 9 percent. The real buying power of private households 
dropped 4.5 percent. 
  The deficit of the total public sector was 8 percent of GDP. 
The municipalities managed more or less to balance their 
revenues and expenditures, which means that the deficit 
originated at state level. 
  The tax rate -- taxes and social security costs as a 
proportion of GDP -- was 46.7 percent, the same as in 1992.

<F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "War of Nerves Over Agriculture"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- "Disheartening," Trade Minister Grete 
Knudsen said of the latest EU [European Union] proposal on 
agricultural support. Now the war of nerves will begin. 
  Norway is pursuing a tough negotiating line in the final 
spurt of the EU negotiations. Yesterday Trade Minister Grete 
Knudsen refused to agree to a proposal from the EU to the effect 
that only regions north of the 62d parallel should enjoy 
additional agricultural support. She made it clear that the 
whole of Norway must be covered by any such arrangement. 
  Briefly, the EU's proposal is that the Nordic countries can 
give additional agricultural support to the regions north of the 
62d parallel and only in rare cases elsewhere. 
  For Norway this would mean that only the regions north of 
Maloy in the west and Femunden in the east would be considered 
to have such difficult conditions affecting cultivation that 
they can be given lasting support arrangements. Another 
criteria is that the regions that qualify for support must have 
fewer than eight inhabitants per square kilometer. 
  During yesterday's relatively short negotiating meeting, it 
emerged that the EU had adopted the 62d parallel because in its 
fisheries policy Norway has defined northern regions through the 
use of this line of latitude. 
  However, in the view of the Norwegian negotiators these two 
things have nothing to do with each other. There are a number 
of regions in southern Norway that also have extremely difficult 
growing conditions. 
  Grete Knudsen told the EU representatives that Norway is 
remaining firm on a system of support that is based on the 
number of growing days -- that is, the number of days every year 
when there is enough sun and warmth for agricultural produce to 
grow. One hundred and ninety growing days or less has been 
proposed as the limit. 
  Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto said that Finland 
would ideally like to have everything north of the 60th parallel 
defined as Nordic agriculture, and 180 growing days as the 
limit. Norway and Finland are coordinating their policies in 
this area. 
  Nor is Knudsen satisfied with the EU's latest initiative in 
the field of regional policy, even though we are here probably 
much closer to a negotiated agreement. 
  The EU has proposed that the four northernmost provinces in 
Norway -- Finnmark, Troms, Nordland, and Nord-Trondelag -- 
should receive regional support from the EU's structural fund. 
  The EU wants to introduce a completely new target category 
for regional support for the three Nordic countries. The 
so-called Objective 6 category will be in addition to the five 
categories the EU already has today. 
  Ideally, Finland and Norway would like the countries to be 
covered by the Objective 1 classification that is the EU's main 
tool for support for regions where people have an annual income 
lower than the EU average. In practice support is given to 
areas where the average income is less than 80 percent of the EU 
average, and Norway takes the view that this is why this 
classification should be used. 
  "If Objective 6 embraces the same as we want -- Objective 1 
-- then it makes no difference what it is called," Grete Knudsen 
said. 
  Like her Nordic counterparts, she will now take a closer 
look 
at the effect this will have on Norway, but the prospect is for 
a 10-percent-lower level of support with Objective 6 than 
Objective 1 would have given. 
  The EU is proposing a 175 million ECU -- around 1.5 billion 
kroner -- framework for regional support in the Nordic area. 
Norway would probably receive around one-third of this money. 
  Negotiations have not even started on the most difficult 
problems in the agricultural sector -- such as the demand for 
introduction of EU prices for agricultural produce from day one 
of membership. These problems are being saved up until the 
upcoming "superweekend," but the fronts seem deadlocked. Here 
Norway is standing shoulder to shoulder with Finland and Austria.

<F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "EU Reached Agreement on </F>
Additional Support"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The Swedish EU [European Union] 
negotiations took a step forward when on Tuesday [22 February] 
the EU countries surprisingly reached agreement to create a 
completely new form of regional support, tailor-made for 
northern Sweden. 
  According to the first rough estimates, this could give 
Sweden's three northernmost provinces around 1,000 kronor per 
inhabitant in EU support. 
  "This EU proposal represents a major step forward," European 
Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel said after Tuesday's 
negotiations with EU ministers. 
  "It is a good, even a very good basis for continued 
discussions. I am convinced that on the basis of this we will 
be able to reach a satisfactory compromise." 
  The new regional support on which the EU countries have 
reached agreement is based on the proposal from the EU 
Commission which was vociferously rejected by France and Spain 
on Monday [21 February] evening. But on Tuesday morning these 
countries were also able to back the support after its name had 
been changed from Objective 1(A) to Objective 6 support and had 
been adjusted on a number of points. 
  Objective 6 support will go to regions with less than eight 
inhabitants per square kilometer. In Sweden this qualifies the 
inland areas of Norrbotten and Vasterbotten provinces and 
Jamtland, but not western Norrland, for which the Swedish 
negotiators have also demanded support. 
  On the basis of the EU's own figures, Ulf Dinkelspiel 
estimates that this could give 500 to 800 million kronor per 
year in Swedish regional support -- a figure which can be 
compared with Sweden's total regional support of around 3 
billion kronor. 
  A snag with the EU's proposal is that it is described as "a 
transitional arrangement" that will be reassessed in 1999 when 
the EU reviews its rules on regional policy. 
  "I raised this matter and they were prepared to remove the 
phrase about a transitional arrangement," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. 
  However, Swedish negotiators are not wholly satisfied with 
the Objective 6 proposal. They still want support for a larger 
chunk of Sweden and are asking for clearer figures. 
  On the subject of support for agriculture in Norrland, the 
Swedish negotiators are also pleased with the openings that have 
occurred. 
  "The EU's proposal goes a fair way toward meeting our 
demands 
even if though it is not as precise as we might wish," Ulf 
Dinkelspiel said. 
  The EU has given the green light for the principle that 
agriculture in northernmost Sweden, Norway, and Finland needs 
special support. In the view of the EU this support can go to 
smaller farms in areas with less than 10 inhabitants per square 
kilometer, north of the 62d parallel. However, in certain cases 
it will also be possible to provide this support south of this 
line of latitude. 
  The EU has also said OK to areas north of the 62d parallel 
having the right to expanded so-called LFA [less-favored areas] 
support from the EU which is normally given to "mountain 
agriculture" above an altitude of 800 meters. 
  Agriculture Minister Karl-Erik Olsson estimates that the 
LFA support could cover 25-30 percent of the billion-krona 
support that today goes to Norrland agriculture every year. 
Sweden has also demanded that the EU must accept responsibility 
for half of the sum needed to cover the rest of support for 
Norrland, but the EU has said no. Sweden must meet that bill 
itself, it says. 
  "We have not abandoned the demand that the EU must be 
involved in footing the bill," Karl-Erik Olsson said, but he 
seems to think that negotiations on this point will be tough. 
  There was also a disappointing message from the EU on 
Swedish 
milk and sugar quotas. Sweden has demanded a milk quota of 3.5 
million tonnes. As expected, the EU is currently offering 3.1 
million tonnes. 
  For sugar production Sweden demanded a quota of 440,000 
tonnes, while the EU wants a quota of only 350,000 tonnes. This 
offer is even lower than the Commission's original proposal. 
  At Tuesday's negotiations the Swedish demand for a 
phasing-in 
of its budget contributions was also discussed. In the first 
few years of Swedish membership Sweden wants to pay a reduced 
membership fee and then gradually increase its payments. But 
the EU countries have agreed to reject this demand. 
  "We explained that Sweden is not demanding a rebate. From 
the first day we want to pay the amount that Swedish EU 
membership costs the EU. We will be paying our full 
contribution in 1999," Dinkelspiel said, adding laconically: 
  "The reception was not enthusiastic." On two minor points 
Sweden and the other Nordic countries were able to reach 
agreement with the EU. A declaration was adopted to the effect 
that even after EU membership Nordic cooperation will continue 
for Sweden, Norway, and Finland. 
  In addition a special Lapp protocol recognizing the Lapps' 
exclusive right to engage in reindeer farming and stressing 
Sweden's, Norway's, and Finland's commitment to the preservation 
of the culture and way of life of the Lapp people.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis met Gustave Feissel, the 
UN secretary general's deputy special representative in Cyprus, 
in the presidential palace this afternoon. The meeting was part 
of the second phase of the proximity talks on the 
confidence-building measures, which began today. 
  Speaking afterward, Feissel repeated that the reports of the 
UN experts on the confidence-building measures are not part of 
the measures package. The situation, he added, is very clear. 
He said the negotiations only concern the confidence-building 
measures package and that anything beyond this is material that 
each uses according to his will. Asked if he thinks the 
situation is clear in [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas' 
mind, Feissel said: Absolutely. Feissel also said that the goal 
of the current phase of the proximity talks is to move swiftly 
to common positions on various points that are included in the 
confidence-building measures package. He also noted that he 
does not think he need state his evaluation after each meeting. 
Feissel refrained from making any reference to the substance of 
the talks and added that there should be more meetings before we 
make an evaluation. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the United 
Nations asked the two sides not to comment at this stage. He 
said the United Nations believes that this will make the 
negotiations easier.

  [Text] Greek Aegean Minister Konstandinos Skandalidhis said 
that Greece believes the current strategy of resolving national 
issues here and now ignores history, is dangerous, and presents 
a hazard for all who express it and promote it. Skandalidhis 
was speaking this evening at Famagusta Gate in Nicosia. He 
stressed that the so-called Greek-Turkish differences are no 
longer being dealt with in a framework in which the balances are 
negative. He added that although Cyprus has been at the center 
of attention for 20 years and the tragedy of the Cypriot people 
seems endless, there can be no final division in which there are 
hostages and occupation in the name of despair or fatigue. 
  Skandalidhis agreed with President Glavkos Kliridhis' view 
that the final solution does not seem close. But, he said, this 
does not mean we should refrain from using every international 
framework for dialogue or from searching for secondary solutions 
when these do not hurt the final goal. Let us be aware, he 
said, of time as a strategy. 
  The Greek Aegean minister said the Cyprus issue was, is, and 
will be a problem of invasion and occupation and change in 
demographic norms by force. He added that having as firm goals 
a united and independent Republic of Cyprus and the withdrawal 
of the occupation troops, we are promoting a pannational effort 
for a productive, just, and viable solution. 
  Skandalidhis added that when it comes to the structural 
choices-- the pannational conference, the amendment of the 
Butrus-Ghali set of ideas, and Cyprus' accession to the European 
Union--Greece backs the common will of the Cypriot leadership. 
  The Greek minister said he thought Turkey would not succeed 
with its final goals. Time works against Turkey, its alliances 
lose strength, and its position is getting weaker all the time. 
  Skandalidhis said that Hellenism has two major strategic 
directions. One is the national defense line that unites Thrace 
with the Aegean and Cyprus. The other is the Balkan and 
Mediterranean axis, that is, the offensive line connecting the 
eastern and northern borders and that has as a front, the Balkan 
peninsula, Central and East Europe, and the southeast 
Mediterranean.

  [Text] The possibility of resuming the Athens-Skopje 
dialogue remains open but it does not mean the prerequisites for 
such a likelihood exist. This is the verbal message from Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou that European Union [EU] 
Commissioner Hans Van den Broek will be conveying to [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, President Kiro] Gligorov. 
After his meeting with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias 
today, van den Broek will be visiting Skopje again. 
  In a statement, Papoulias noted that the government says yes 
to the dialogue as long as the conditions it has set out are 
fulfilled. Papoulias added: Gligorov and Skopje should abandon 
their intransigence and Greece will wait until then. 
  Van den Broek said the disagreements between the two sides 
should be raised for discussion at the negotiating table 
urgently, stressed that his own efforts are of a temporary 
nature, and referred to the good offices of Cyrus Vance at the 
United Nations. 
  Papoulias made it clear that if and when the dialogue 
resumes 
at the United Nations, the name issue would be excluded from the 
package of issues to be discussed. The foreign minister further 
noted that the process of handling the name issue will be very 
time consuming. 
  The EU commissioner will have a telephone conversation with 
Papoulias tomorrow to brief him on the commissioner's meeting 
with Gligorov today. 
  Asked about the likelihood of a meeting on the foreign 
minister level between Athens and Skopje, Papoulias said that 
the current facts indicate that this is premature. Asked 
whether Greece would give its consent to Skopje's accession to 
the CSCE, Papoulias noted that as far as the Greek side is 
concerned, nothing has changed, since Skopje's intransigence 
continues.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today 
described as diplomatic impropriety the move by [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM, President Kiro] Gligorov 
to make his letter to the Greek prime minister public before it 
was actually delivered to Papandreou. The government spokesman 
reiterated that the Greek Government received the letter with 
some reservations, since it bore the name Macedonia. It merely 
received the letter so that it might learn the content and study 
it. 
  Venizelos said the European Union's [EU] Dutch Commissioner 
Hans van den Broek established Skopje's intransigence, so he 
might have realized, even belatedly, why Greece adopted these 
measures. Asked if Van den Broek asked the Greek Government to 
lift the measures, Venizelos said he had not, because Greece 
insists on its positions. Only when there is practical proof of 
Skopje's goodwill could our country lift the measures and 
reconsider its stance on Skopje's accession to the CSCE. Only 
then, the government spokesman stressed, will we resume the 
dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations and Cyrus 
Vance. The subject of the dialogue will be Greece-Skopje's 
economic cooperation and the name, on which Greece's position is 
well known. 
  Venizelos said he hoped the Dutch commissioner's initiative 
would continue.

<F P=106> [Ugur Sefkat report: "Gures: We Can Intervene in a Regional </F>
Crisis"] 
  [Text] Ankara--General Dogan Gures, chief of the General 
Staff, has said that the military strength of various countries 
cannot be regarded as the only threat to Turkey's security, as 
has been the case in the past. He noted that the political, 
economic, and social instability in those countries and the 
border disputes, struggles for power and influence, and acts of 
terrorism in the region also threaten Turkey's security. 
  In a statement to the DEFENSE AND AVIATION MAGAZINE, Gen. 
Gures asserted that intervening in a regional crisis is one of 
the Turkish Armed Forces' main strategic objectives. He said: 
"In addition to the crisis situations in the region, the 
Turkish Armed Forces have to be prepared to intervene in crisis 
situations in the world, which pose a threat to peace and in 
which human rights are violated. Of course, that is subject to 
the political decisions made by the Turkish Government. 
Meanwhile, preparations are being made in light of the lesson 
we learned from the Gulf crisis, the developments linked to the 
Turkish Armed Forces' strategy from the 1990's to the following 
decade, and the concepts of military structure and use of 
military strength. Our military strategy has been updated in 
accordance with the principles of maintaining a deterrent 
military strength, establishing superior maneuvering capability, 
intervening in crisis situations, establishing advance defense 
capabilities, maintaining a high level of preparedness until 
stability is established in the region, establishing collective 
security, acquiring modern arms within the limits of the Treaty 
on Conventional Forces in Europe, and organizing well-trained 
units that will be capable of effectively using modern arms 
against any aggressor. We have to maintain a reliable and 
deterrent military force in our region in which a crisis 
situation may create multiple threats." 
  Regarding Turkey's security, Gen. Gures said: "Turkey's 
short-term, medium-term, and long-term security depends on the 
maintenance of NATO's importance; Turkey becoming a member of 
the Western European Union; and the establishment of close 
relations with friendly and allied countries, including 
countries beyond the Atlantic Ocean."

<F P=106> [Interview with Robert Urbain, foreign trade and European </F>
affairs minister, by "PG"; place and date not given: "They Have 
a Place of Honor -- Everywhere in Europe the Citizens Are 
Praised in Speeches. And They Get a Special Mention in the 
Maastricht Treaty. But They Still Continue To Grouch. The 
European Affairs Minister Knows Why"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [KNACK] In the Maastricht 
Treaty, European citizenship is recognized for the first time. 
With the Treaty citizens then gained rights. But the people 
gave a very cold reception to Maastricht. Did that surprise you? 
  [Urbain] There is an explanation for the unenthusiastic 
reaction. For the first time people in Europe actually became 
aware of how important Europe really was. Without people really 
realizing, it had suddenly established itself in all areas of 
economic life. That was the intention of the fathers of Europe, 
because this was how they tried to get around the political 
obstacles threatening European integration. The strategy was 
right. In any case the attempt to extend Europe through 
establishing a common defense community failed completely. It 
was too ambitious, and too unrealistic. With the Treaty of Rome 
the economic path was chosen, and they succeeded in keeping the 
essentials. European Commission President Jacques Delors has 
formulated this strategy more than once. If the economy 
permeates the whole of society, he once said, then politics will 
have to follow. 
  Of course there are dark sides too. Citizens, who were 
situated in their own familiar national politics with all their 
roots, were out in the cold. With Maastricht the people 
suddenly discovered that Europe had grown into an enormous 
machine. [passage omitted] 
  [KNACK] Will Schengen change things much for citizens? 
  [Urbain] At the national borders it will be symbolic rather 
than anything else. Nevertheless, the Germans want to take 
things as far as possible and clear all barriers and toll 
houses. The difference will be noticeable mainly in the 
airports. Therefore, in Zaventem we will have to distinguish 
between domestic, now European flights, and international 
flights. 
  [KNACK] What is the main motivation for the free movement of 
people? Is it political emancipation or is it a way of crowning 
consumers? 
  [Urbain] Free movement is an ambiguous concept. The fact 
that controls are disappearing is de facto recognition of 
European citizenship. In a federal European state everyone must 
be free to move about fully. That is absolutely obvious. 
Therefore there is a marked political dimension. The Treaty of 
Rome had insisted already on the need for free movement in its 
economic sense -- the idea that workers must be able to move 
freely. The Single European Act dealt with many obstacles, like 
the problem of the equivalence of qualifications. With that, 
the economic restriction was finally broken and economically 
inactive people and students suddenly were given access to the 
European space. Police checks also must be stopped to realize a 
truly European citizenship. For me, that is why Schengen is so 
important. We are gradually reaching a situation like in the 
United States. With an identity document issued in New York or 
Miami you can cruise through the whole country without being 
checked. 
  [KNACK] What use is European citizenship without a social 
statute? 
  [Urbain] Europe started as an economic project and the 
social 
aspect was only an appendage to that. Workers could move only 
if it was to the good of industry. The social aspect was 
discovered only much later. And even then, only a fraction of 
politicians attach any importance to it. Citizenship is a 
purely political concept. And a very nineteenth century, liberal 
one at that: The social aspects are virtually not included. In 
any case there is no consensus on the social policies to be 
followed. After all, some parties and countries defend a 
minimal role for the state. Regardless of that, there are major 
differences in opinion between the promoters of a more thorough 
government role. 
  The Spanish socialists try to benefit from their weak social 
security system and the low minimum wage levels. They use it as 
an argument to attract investors. If you were to force them 
overnight to apply the Belgian social security system then you 
would put them in an impossible situation. Therefore there is 
no agreement on the left, nor on the right either. Germany 
wants a federal and politically strong Europe, but they are 
against any state intervention in the economy. They can be 
counted upon to strengthen the European Parliament, but they do 
not want to talk about an industrial policy. And then there is 
the United Kingdom. It wants nothing, apart from a free trade 
zone. 
  [KNACK] Doesn't the absence of social policies mean that a 
time bomb is ticking away under the European building? 
  [Urbain] There is no way back. Any return to a national 
approach, even in social policies, is doomed to fail. There is 
no alternative. Of course we must manage the transition. All 
governments know that they can only fight unemployment on a 
European level. That led to the idea of the European recovery 
plan and Delors's White Paper. Everyone makes largely the same 
diagnosis, but there are differences in opinion on policy 
measures. The way Europe works is in a sense comparable to the 
Flemish Government in the past. All the large parties are 
automatically included, without there being the least agreement 
on a government program. The commission and council are an 
amalgam where all the political tendencies are represented and 
where there is agreement on the minimum only. On a European 
level we should also move toward some sort of coalition 
government, on the basis of a program, but then the European 
Parliament would have to play a very different role and have a 
direct link with government. We are not so far yet. After all, 
if that were to happen, the legitimacy of the member states 
would be put at doubt. [passage omitted] 
  [KNACK] Isn't it time for a European constitution? 
  [Urbain] We will achieve something which looks like a 
constitution with subsequent treaties. In any event I do not 
believe that in the foreseeable future the European Parliament 
will be able to act as a component part. A project like that 
would have to be supported by a powerful current in public 
opinion and that does not exist. Also there is no political 
family which operates at the level of the whole continent. 
There are federations, in fact even confederations of national 
political parties, but everything remains abstract. Who knows 
in Wallonia that Claes is president of the European socialists? 
However, it is fundamental for European unification that real 
European parties emerge. That implies a change in the electoral 
system. Today you still have to vote for national lists of 
candidates. Only when the whole of Europe can vote for Ruud 
Lubbers, Helmut Kohl, Jose Happart, or Freddy Willockx would a 
very different consciousness grow up. We are a long way from 
that and Belgium has even moved in the other direction. 
  [KNACK] So just a European referendum? 
  [Urbain] That is perhaps conceivable for matters like the 
membership of new countries. That is not being discussed yet, 
because it implies direct constitutional power at a European 
level. It presupposes a direct link between citizens and the 
top. Obviously there is great opposition to that. All the 
interim stages -- whether they are the states or regions -- have 
little interest in it. The same line of reasoning applies to a 
European president. It cannot be excluded that one day there 
will be something like that, at least if serious European 
defense policies are ever realized, but it seems impossible to 
imagine taking unanimous decisions in that field. [passage

<F P=106> ["egl"-attributed report: "Warning Against Western Credits </F>
to Moscow"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 24 February -- Western investors must expect 
clearly higher risks in Russia for the foreseeable future, 
warned Yegor Gaydar, former head of government who now is the 
chairman of the Russia's Choice movement. 
  At a panel discussion of the Conrad Adenauer Foundation on 
the "Future of Reforms in Russia," Gaydar, with leading members 
of his party and other groups of the democratic camp, advocated 
the view that the amnesty decision of the State Duma in Russia 
will lead to civil war. 
  The prominent Russian reformer advised the finance ministers 
and central bank chiefs of the seven leading industrialized 
nations (G-7), who will meet at Kronberg Castle over the weekend 
[26-27 February], to postpone further payment of IMF loans until 
"the efficient use of the money can be ensured" through specific 
progress in the reforms. This is not the case under the current 
circumstances. Nowadays, further external financial aid from 
the West is pointless, Gaydar said. 
  The decisive thing is that Russia continue the initiated 
course of reform of its own accord and ensure the stabilization 
of the ruble. As long as the new government continues to drive 
the state finances into ever higher deficits with ever new 
promises of expenditure, one need not be surprised if Russian 
companies transfer more and more dollars into Swiss accounts. 
  Gaydar harshly criticized the Chernomyrdin government for 
giving the ruble additional inflation by relapsing into the 
monetary union, as in the case of Belarus. The monetary union 
with other follow-up republics of the former Soviet Union has 
caused costs amounting to 10 percent of the Russian GNP. It is 
quite clear that reformers like himself did not make themselves 
popular by uncoupling themselves from the other republics. 
  Viktor I. Sheinis, another high-ranking representative from 
the democratic camp, namely from the "Yavlinskiy-Bodyrev-Lukin 
Group" (Yablonko), painted a somber picture after the latest 
surprise coup of the old communists and ultranationalists in the 
State Duma. Dangers are growing in Russia -- also for the West 
-- that are much greater than the Iraq threat was at its time. 
At that time, the West mobilized gigantic resources at very 
short notice for the Gulf War. 
  The Yablonko representative referred to the parallels 
between 
today's Russia and the Germany of the Weimar Republic, which was 
humiliated by the Treaty of Versailles. Ultrarightists and old 
communists are not offering any solutions for the enormous 
problems, but they are using the people's misery, which has been 
spreading following the collapse of the communist economic 
system. They are sowing hatred and use foreign policy topics as 
a playing ground for the domestic struggle for power. In view 
of the fragmentation and the difficulties in establishing 
democratic party structures, for instance, the democrats will 
have a very difficult position over the next months and years, 
Sheinis said. 
  More clearly than the other politicians, who had flown in 
from Moscow, Sheinis pointed out that democrats and market 
economy reformers contributed primarily with their own mistakes 
to giving the old communists and the ultrarightists their 
current majorities in the large country. 
  How harshly Russian democrats can polemize against the role 
of NATO in Bosnia and in the new relations with the East 
European reform states was shown by Sergey N. Yushenkov, member 
of the Defense Committee in the State Duma and manager of 
Gaydar's parliamentary group. On the other hand, Boris A. 
Solutukhin, who is responsible for human rights issues in 
Gaydar's group, made it clear that Russia's citizens will not 
easily permit themselves to be put into the straitjacket of a 
dictatorship again. 
  The Russian democrats, however, seemed to agree on one 
issue, 
namely that the amnesty decision, which is supported by an 
unholy alliance of ultrarightists and old communists with a 
surprising majority, cannot be abolished by the courts. Rather, 
the opponents of economic reforms and democracy hardly have any 
other choice "than to adjust to even worse times." [sentence as

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Claire </F>
Trean; place and date not given: "Mr. Juppe Revives Idea of 
`Overall Peace Plan' for Bosnia"] 
  [Text] On 23 February, Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
suggested to his American and French counterparts, the French 
prime minister, and the German chancellor that they hold a 
summit to sign a "historic" document settling the Bosnian 
conflict. 
  In an interview granted to us by the French foreign 
minister, 
he said that he was in favor of a "contract" between these 
powers that would allow them to revive efforts to accomplish an 
"overall peace plan" for Bosnia, before any international 
conference was held with all the sides involved. An incident 
near Tuzla on Tuesday [22 February] nearly led to NATO air 
intervention. 
  [Trean] Why did we wait so long before issuing an ultimatum 
to the Bosnian Serbs? 
  [Juppe] Quite simply because in diplomacy, as in life, 
decisions are made once the desire and a proper time have been 
established. We have long had the desire, as have some of our 
partners, but not everyone. There was a great deal of 
hesitation about the use of force by the Europeans, UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces], and the United Nations, as well as by 
certain countries outside the European Union. Others were 
prepared to use any pressure, including force, and I believe 
that France was one of those. 
  As for the timing, it was a result of the shock caused by 
the 
attack on the Sarajevo marketplace on 5 February -- although we 
might feel that that is emotional diplomacy and deplore the 
excessive influence of television and the images it shows. It 
was from that point that the desire, expressed more or less 
explicitly during the NATO summit in January, found the right 
time to crystallize. The arguments that we highlighted, and 
which had not been heard beforehand, were then heard as a result 
of that tragedy. 
  [Trean] Could the same schema apply in other cases, in other 
words, could we loosen the siege of certain Muslim enclaves with 
the help of military pressure? 
  [Juppe] I hope that we do not have to see the same tragedies 
repeated to do so. In my analysis, we do not currently need new 
ultimatums for the other safe areas. The system is perfectly 
operational and France is determined to ask for it to be used if 
necessary. 
  For Tuzla, it has been decided to base the airplanes used in 
the airlift at the airport. If the Serb batteries hinder this, 
then there is no need for an ultimatum. NATO's air response can 
be instantaneous because we would be acting within the framework 
of adopted resolutions. The same holds true for Srebrenica, 
Gorazde, and the other safe areas. The problem could arise, 
however, in the other areas not covered by Resolution 836. 
Here, I am thinking of Mostar and Vitez. 
  [Trean] So why has the Tuzla airport not been opened yet? 
  [Juppe] Because the general line taken until the NATO 
ultimatum -- and that was where there was a turning point -- was 
to achieve the objective without using force. What UNPROFOR 
tried to do in Srebrenica and Tuzla was to apply the UN 
decisions by mutual consent, i.e., to gain the agreement of the 
Serbs. It was on the way to achieving this, since in Srebrenica 
things are getting under way and in Tuzla the date of 7 March 
was chosen on friendly terms. 
  [Trean] Is there really a difference between "air support" 
and "air strikes?" 
  [Juppe] Yes. The terms of the Sarajevo ultimatum were: You 
withdraw or we will strike. In the other safe areas, the terms 
are: If you attack us, we will respond. That is not the logic 
of an ultimatum. For the time being, we must try and use the 
momentum gained by Sarajevo to unblock the situation. Later on 
we will see whether we need other ultimatums. 
  [Trean] A lot of UNPROFOR resources are converging on 
Sarajevo. Is that not a risk for the other areas? 
  [Juppe] It is indeed a risk. It is true that we gave 
priority to Sarajevo. In the next few days we are going to run 
up against the question of UNPROFOR's total resources. That 
means two things: money and troops. France is prepared to 
redeploy its resources within Yugoslavia, but we are not in a 
position to increase the total number of troops. The British 
have taken more or less the same position. There is going to be 
a problem there. The American position is clear: No troops as 
long as an agreement has not been signed. However, in my 
opinion, if the United Nations genuinely wants to we can quite 
quickly find the needed reinforcements. 
<H5>  }Sarajevo Under UN Administration </H5>
  [Trean] France asked a meeting of the Security Council to 
decree that Sarajevo be placed under UN administration. What 
does that mean in concrete terms? 
  [Juppe] A Security Council meeting would be helpful at this 
point: First, to take stock of what has happened and to remark 
that progress has been made; and second, to recall the demand 
made by the United Nations and NATO, namely the lifting of the 
siege against Sarajevo. That particular element has not been 
obtained: The lifting of the siege does not mean simply 
stopping the shelling, but free movement and the unhindered flow 
of supplies to the city. There is also the matter of putting the 
idea of UN administration of Sarajevo into concrete terms via an 
official decision. This is part of the European peace plan, 
which was accepted by the parties involved, and which was 
accepted in principle by the Americans and the Russians. In 
concrete terms, this means defining a perimeter: the nine 
districts of Greater Sarajevo, for example. It also means 
appointing a UN authority that would exercise the power of 
administration or coordination for the entire area, whereas at 
present there are numerous players on the ground, both civilian 
and military. Lastly, the purpose of this resolution could be 
to ask this coordinator to quickly suggest the resources needed 
to effectively implement this administration -- here I am 
thinking of the running of essential public services, such as 
water, gas, etc.) so that the Security Council could deliberate 
on things apart from more or less subjective or theoretical 
assessments. 
  [Trean] Administration evokes memories of the colonial 
mandates. That sounds like the relinquishment of sovereignty. 
  [Juppe] There is currently a plan whose principles have been 
agreed, but which has not been signed. This plan, which 
includes the agreement concluded on board the Invincible in 
September 1993, notes that, for the Sarajevo region, we are not 
yet capable of reaching an agreement on the allocation of the 
territory between the Serbs and Muslims. 
  [Trean] You mean on a division? 
  [Juppe] In the absence of an agreement, we have decided that 
in Sarajevo power will be wielded by the United Nations for a 
period of two years, so that in the meantime the parties can 
reach an agreement on a definitive status. It is therefore a 
temporary administration so that this problem will not prevent 
the conclusion of a comprehensive agreement. That is the 
underlying thinking. This is not supervision forever. 
  [Trean] What exactly will this UN authority cover? 
  [Juppe] The city will be run by the United Nations. To do 
that it must be demilitarized, which presupposed controlling 
heavy weapons and infantry. 
  [Trean] Did you talk about this with Mr. Izetbegovic last 
week? 
  [Juppe] Mr. Izetbegovic agreed to the principle last 
November, but I did not talk to him about it in detail last 
week. We had other topics on our minds, particularly the 
ultimatum. 
  [Trean] It seems pretty difficult to have it accepted by the 
Bosnians. 
  [Juppe] The same is true for the Serbs. They are present in 
Sarajevo: There are Serb areas and Serb troops. It is valid 
for everyone. 
  [Trean] But it is the capital of the Bosnian state. 
  [Juppe] It is the capital of a state which currently does 
not 
exert its authority over all of Bosnia. We are therefore 
completely justified in obtaining this mandate on a provisional 
basis, just as in Mostar. 
<H5>  Russian Game </H5>
  [Trean] The French approach contains the idea of a kind of 
role-sharing between the powers, with each one supposed to exert 
pressure on such and such a party in the conflict. Do you think 
that the Russians are going to play the game and really obtain 
concessions from the Serbs? Would they not rather play the old 
Russian-Serb alliance, as they have been doing virtually openly 
so far? 
  [Juppe] The Russians have already obtained concessions from 
the Serbs. 
  [Trean] Because there was an ultimatum that caused them 
considerable bother... 
  [Juppe] First of all, this ultimatum remains binding. Next, 
everyone understands now that we had an interest in finding a 
solution. It is actually a bet on the attitude of both Russia 
and the United States: Has each party now really been persuaded 
that a rapid peace settlement must be found? That is what Mr. 
Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton say. 
<H5>  Peace Plan in Two Weeks </H5>
  [Trean] Mr. Yeltsin says it in the same sense as the Serbs, 
who are the first to want an agreement based on the current 
foundations. 
  [Juppe] That has been true for a long time, for two reasons: 
Because they got what they wanted and because they have a real 
interest in obtaining a gradual lifting of the sanctions, but 
the Serbs finally gave up in Sarajevo. There were victory cries 
in Pale, but we have to make allowances for the intoxication: 
They yielded because they were in a situation of political and 
military inferiority and because the Russians told them to 
yield. So the game of wielding power over the parties has 
begun. The question now is to know whether the Russians are 
prepared to say to the Serbs: As regards the control of the 
territories, here are the few essential conditions needed to 
conclude an agreement. That is the only bet we are making -- 
just as we are betting on the American attitude. The Americans 
have already told the Bosnians: No provocation, respect the 
cease-fire, and put your weapons under UN control. That is what 
they got. Now, with our consent, they are exploring the idea 
with the Muslims and Croats of a Croat-Muslim confederation 
within the framework of the broad principles of the European 
plan, i.e., covering 51 percent of the territory. The whole 
question is knowing whether this game of Russian pressure on the 
Serbs and American pressure on the Muslims and Croats is going 
to be able to comprise a peace plan in the next two or four 
weeks that will be accepted by the Europeans and agreed by all 
parties. 
<H5>  Croat-Muslim Confederation </H5>
  [Trean] Is France neutral in this game of pressure? 
  [Juppe] No, France is not neutral, much less is it inactive. 
First of all, it is France that called on the Russians and 
Americans to enter the field. We now have two roles to play: 
The first is remembering that Europe is involved and that it is 
one of the parties involved; and the second is making sure that 
the various players involved, especially the Americans, are 
aware that the solution currently being worked out must not be a 
solution that pushes one of the parties aside. We must try and 
reconcile the viewpoints of the various parties. 
  [Trean] So far the Croats have rejected the idea of a 
confederation... 
  [Juppe] They have already suggested it. It is my 
understanding that the Croats and Muslims have already given 
their agreement in principle to this idea of a confederation. 
This raises many questions: Are we definitely sure that it is 
confined to the 51-percent limit on the territory (17.5 percent 
plus 33.3 percent)? I have been told yes. Will it comprise two 
confederal entities or will it be a confederation divided up 
into districts? This is not yet clear. One of the 
possibilities will be to have a single state with five 
districts: three Muslim districts, and two Croat districts. 
Third, will this entity -- whatever form it takes -- have links 
with the Serb entity? Will it be part of a Bosnia-Herzegovina 
that is theoretically independent and a member of the United 
Nations, with a Serb part and a Croat-Muslim part? Or, on the 
contrary, would it be a solution that would encourage the Serb 
part to take back its freedom and move closer to Belgrade? 
<H5>  Owen And Stoltenberg `In Retreat' </H5>
  [Trean] Is the unity of Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer 
defended 
by anyone? 
  [Juppe] In the current situation, it is a fiction. The 
Croat-Muslim confederation has at least one advantage: It makes 
it possible to solve the problem of access to the sea, which is 
one of the sticky points in the negotiations. The part of the 
territory that goes up to the port of Neum would belong to the 
confederation and, in the event of a secession, it would return 
-- under full sovereignty -- to that party of the confederation 
not responsible for the secession. However, it remains to be 
seen whether this solution is acceptable to the Serbs. 
  [Trean] Would that involve a few concessions by them? 
  [Juppe] It would assume that the Serbs and Muslims agree to 
discuss enclaves in the east and possible arrangements in 
central Bosnia. 
  [Trean] Do you think that all this will be feasible? 
  [Juppe] That is the question we are asking ourselves today, 
especially bearing in mind the breakdown in the discussion 
process. 
  [Trean] Are the negotiators, Messrs. Owen and Stoltenberg, 
losing their grip on the negotiations? 
  [Juppe] Messrs. Owen and Stoltenberg agreed to step back a 
little to see what the current talks yield. So when and how are 
we going to get everyone to sit down around the table and see if 
we reach a feasible solution? We must get there as fast as 
possible. 
<H5>  `Our Essential Interests' </H5>
  [Trean] Are you thinking of a new international conference? 
  [Juppe] No, first of all, I am thinking of contacts between 
the various players involved. That could then lead to something 
that will resemble an international conference. The Russians 
suggested it, and so did the Germans, but the Americans are a 
bit hesitant and I share their hesitance: Before committing 
ourselves to this kind of exercise, there must be an agreement 
between the Americans, Russians, and us on the basis of an 
overall settlement. 
  [Trean] What, for you, is a "feasible" plan? 
  [Juppe] The best peace plan is a plan that can be accepted 
by 
everyone. 
  [Trean] Does this exercise between great powers also involve 
Croatia, Kosovo, and Macedonia? 
  [Juppe] It will have to, but what we are currently 
discussing 
is a settlement in Bosnia. The rest will be the topic of a 
large conference. The situation is actually more stable in 
Krajina and there are Croat-Serb talks which, according to 
President Tudjman, are tending to make progress. As for Kosovo 
and Macedonia, things will be more difficult. The international 
community recognizes the sovereignty of Serbia in Kosovo. We 
will have to obtain the guarantee that the rights of minorities 
in Kosovo will be guaranteed and respected. This will have to 
be obtained within the framework of, say, another exercise, such 
as the large conference on the Balkans. 
  [Trean] Can we tackle the problem of Macedonia, while Greece 
is president of the European Union? 
  [Juppe] That has not stopped practically every country of 
the 
European Union from expressing a certain amount of displeasure 
at the recent Greek initiatives. All this is unreasonable. The 
Greeks must be encouraged to resume the negotiation process. Of 
course, Macedonia too must make some gestures. But such 
gestures will not be obtained by a blockade. 
  [Trean] In your opinion does France have a particular 
responsibility in this region? 
  [Juppe] As the president of the Republic said: "It regards 
us." Indeed, it concerns us for many reasons: Because it is in 
the middle of Europe; because there are enormous risks of it 
spreading; because the conference on stability in Europe 
advocated by the prime minister would have much more weight if 
we managed to unblock this matter; and because it calls into 
question the entire policy of enlarging the European Union to 
include the countries of central and eastern Europe. The two 
big problems in European integration by the year 2000 will be 
enlargement and security. We cannot suppose that there will be 
a sort of enclave in the Balkans that does not concern us. I 
truly think that our interests -- perhaps not our vital 
interests, but certainly our essential interests -- are at stake 
in this affair, and that justifies us devoting time and energy 
to it.

  [Text] Rome, Feb 25 (AFP) -- Italian Defense Minister 
Fabio Fabbri said Friday [25 February] Western nations were 
again facing a Russia problem, but urged them to deal with it 
with dialogue and firmness. 
  "The void left by the Warsaw Pact cannot last long. Either 
the West fills it or Russian hegemony will return," Fabbri told 
journalists here. 
  "The West is again facing a Russia problem," he said, adding 
that this "delicate issue must be treated by combining dialogue 
and firmness." 
  Russia was politically and economically weak but its 
conventional and nuclear weapons also made it strong, he said, 
adding that its weaknesses and internal contrasts could explain 
why it was "asking for a new Yalta and claiming a freedom of 
action in what it defines as its intangible sphere of influence." 
  He was referring to the Yalta accords, reached between 
Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill three months before the end of 
World War II, by which the Soviet Union gained hegemony over 
East Europe. 
  Fabbri said statements by Italy's opposition communists that 
NATO had outlived itself and should be disbanded were "not in 
the interest of Italy, Europe or the West." 
  "Never more than today has the Atlantic Alliance been a 
pillar of security for the West and the international order."

Station"] 
  [Text] IVO, a subsidiary of the Imatran Voima company, is 
to deliver a simulator to Russia's Kola Nuclear Power Station 
for technical failure and emergency management training. The 
simulator will improve the ability of the operators to control 
the power station in case of a breakdown or an accident. The 
simulator can also be used to test the effects of the plans to 
transform the plant's operations. 
  The delivery, worth about 1 million Finnish markkas, is 
financed by the Commerce and Industry Ministry and the Foreign 
Ministry. The delivery has been made within the framework of 
the safety improvement program for nuclear power stations in 
Russia. The simulator, which will be shipped to Kola in April, 
is scheduled to be operational in September.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of Murat Karayalcin, state </F>
minister and deputy prime minister] 
  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime 
minister, has declared that he regards certain incidents in 
recent days as the preparations of centers which would like to 
interrupt or eliminate democracy, but this was interpreted in an 
exaggerated manner. 
  In a written statement issued today, Karayalcin noted that 
he 
finds the massacre at Tuzla train station in which five officer 
cadets were martyred, the bombing of the Democracy Party 
headquarters, and the killing of the Motherland Party mayor of 
Adalar, as very worrying from the viewpoint of their timing as 
well as their nature. 
  Stressing that it does not matter much if these incidents 
were planned or coincidental, Karayalcin said: I described my 
concern on the subject as the preparations of centers wanting to 
interrupt or eliminate democracy and I called on all political 
party leaders to display unity against such moves. Asked by 
reporters who these centers are, I retorted: I wish I knew and 
I could make it public. These attacks are directed against 
democracy. I do not believe that anyone could interpret these 
intensifying incidents of terror and bombing in any other way. 
I continue to hold these views. In voicing my concern, 
however, I never used the word coup. I never linked the 
incidents to the army. Moreover, if I had any information on 
the subject, I would not have hesitated to make it public in 
line with my understanding of democracy. 
  Karayalcin remarked that democracy is the only foundation 
for 
the solution of all problems and called on all parties to 
embrace one another and democracy.
