<F P=106> [Article by Yun Yang: "Major Current Tides in China's News </F>
Media"] 
  [Text] Under a planned economic system, 
news-gathering activities tend to be carried out only on the 
basis of being governed by "plans," seeking news on the basis of 
being guided by the spirit. Otherwise, even reports which are 
very newsworthy would have to be thrown into the trash heap. 
Now, under a market economy, how is the situation? 
  "Recently a hinterland publication carried a report: A group 
of over 20 human snakes from Fujian, carrying service passports 
bought with money, traveled to the United States by air in an 
attempt to immigrate into the United States; eventually they 
were exposed and became illegal immigrants." 
  Some time ago, while presiding over a seminar here in Hong 
Kong, Fang Hanqi, professor at the Journalism School of the 
People's University of China and member of the academic 
discipline evaluation group under the State Council, discussed 
China's news-reporting industry since the 14th CPC Congress. He 
pointed out that in the past it had been impossible to see in 
newspapers such absurd stories as the one mentioned above. 
  Reporting good news but not bad news was a reporting policy 
of the Chinese media in the past. No matter how big a traffic 
accident or a natural or human disaster was, it would not be 
reported in a timely manner by newspapers. However, such an 
ossified view has now been loosened up. Recently, newspapers 
inside China even reported the news of a scientific exploration 
satellite's failure to return to the earth on schedule. 
  In the past, not only was "bad news" kept unreported, but 
the 
so-called "secrets" were also kept unreported. At that time the 
country was closed to a great extent and the scope of secrets to 
be kept was large. During the Cultural Revolution, ordinary 
people in such a great country were not even allowed to know 
when and where a session of the People's Congress, attended by 
several thousand people, was held. A news report was released 
only after the session was concluded. Activities at the session 
were even more a matter of secret. Comparatively, the current 
situation represents substantial changes, and embodies 
journalistic values to a greater extent. 
<H5>  The System of Newspaper Management Has Changed Substantially </H5>
  The system of newspaper management has also undergone some 
changes, and the dual-track party-government system has been 
restored. 
  For a long time in the past, the media were all managed by 
the propaganda departments of party committees. It was only in 
1987 that the Press and Publication Administration, which would 
regulate nonparty newspapers, was restored. The Press and 
Publication Administration was in fact established (under the 
name of the General Press Administration) in the early years of 
the PRC. For at that time there were also some newspapers which 
were public-private joint operations, some private newspapers, 
and some newspapers run by foreigners. As party committees' 
propaganda departments could not handle matters involving so 
many newspapers, the General Press Administration under the 
State Council was thus established. But, in the early 1950s, 
foreign newspapers disappeared, while private newspapers as well 
as newspapers which had been public-private joint operations 
were all turned into public operations, which could then all be 
managed by party committees' propaganda departments. As a result 
the General Press Administration was abolished. 
  To some extent the restoration of the Press and Publication 
Administration reflected the diversification of publications. 
  In addition, Professor Fang argued, news-gathering 
activities 
were also governed by plans under a planned economy. If the 
superior agencies determined that there was a sector, then there 
would be a corresponding office in a newspaper, which would be 
exclusively engaged in reporting news about the sector. In the 
past, news-seeking activities had to be carried out in the 
designated sectors and in accordance with plans and the spirit. 
Otherwise, even reports which were very newsworthy would be 
thrown into the trash heap. This way of doing things also made 
reporters lazy and stupid. 
  Photographs were handled in the same way. The size of a 
photograph carried by a newspaper was not determined by its news 
value, but by the bureaucratic rank of the person in the 
photograph. 
<H3>  Substantial Increases in the Number of Publications and in 
Advertisement </H3>
  Changes in the quantity, layout, and content of the media 
are 
even more obvious. 
  Since the 14th CPC Congress held in October last year, the 
market economy within China has been getting increasingly 
lively, and the news-reporting industry has also achieved 
significant development, resulting in a substantial quantitative 
increase in the media (see Table 1). The present period is one 
of the periods in Chinese history where the news-reporting 
industry is the most prosperous in terms of quantity; there are 
now more publications than pre-Liberation 1946 when there were 
over 1,400 publications. Furthermore, the growth in quantity is 
continuing. According to estimates, next year the aggregate 
circulation of publications will increase by 15 percent over 
this year. Currently, the number of newspapers increases by one 
every two and one-half days, the number of periodicals increases 
by one every two days, and the number of publishing houses 
increases by one every nine days. 
  Because of the large advertising demand resulting from the 
development of the market economy, the volume of advertising 
business of the media is also increasing substantially, 
producing an average annual growth rate of over 40 percent (see 
Table 2). 
  In order to attract more customers, the contents of 
publications cannot remain so boring and undiversified as 
previously, and are becoming more diversified and interesting, 
with each publication showing its characteristics in a creative 
way. 
  Before the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, 
the media carried few advertisements. For, after the founding 
of the PRC, publications in China emulated the Soviet Union; as 
PRAVDA carried no advertisements, publications in China would 
carry few advertisements. During the "Cultural Revolution," 
there were mainly four categories only: advertisements about 
books and periodicals, theater performance advertisements, 
lost-and-found announcements, and government announcements on 
land requisition and the cleaning up of graves. 
  As the survival of the media would depend on advertisements, 
it was inevitable that the contents of a thousand newspapers 
would be the same. Especially during the Cultural Revolution, in 
order to avoid making mistakes, local newspapers would telephone 
RENMIN RIBAO every evening "to compare the layouts" so as to 
ensure their being identical. 
  Presently, as the media are growing quantitatively, 
competition becomes inevitable. It can be confidently predicted 
that such things as contents and reporting methods will also be 
improved on a daily basis because of the need to attract readers 
and customers.

<H5>  There Is a Fever of Paid News Reporting </H5>
  With the development of the market economy, the 
new-reporting 
industry is undergoing reform continuously; but many problems 
have also emerged. In his speech, Professor Fang Hanqi also gave 
a detailed briefing on the problems. 
  Recently a doggerel has appeared in China: "First-rate 
journalists trade in stocks; second-rate journalists solicit 
advertisement business; third-rate journalists write for other 
publications; fourth-rate journalists attend meetings; and 
fifth-rate journalists edit articles." This shows that many 
journalists are devoted to their second jobs, whereas those who 
are doing their primary jobs are ridiculed as fifth-rate 
journalists. 
  In addition, the increase in paid news reporting is also 
producing ever greater detrimental impact on the spirit of 
journalists. 
  News space can be sold for "red envelopes"; what follows the 
words, "a report by this newspaper," is actually an 
advertisement. After reading it, readers cannot but feel 
cheated. In his speech, Professor Fang cited many instances: 
  The "richest village," Daqiu Village, bought over a 
floor-cleaning worker at the Japanese embassy with 70,000 yuan, 
and arranged, through that worker, for a Japanese reporter to 
visit Daqiu Village. Recently, after Daqiu Village's problem was 
exposed, Daqiu Village gave a 50,000-yuan bribe to a government 
functionary with a rank which was not very high, so as to be 
informed of the attitude of the agency in charge of the matter 
with regard to the handling of Daqiu village's problem. This 
shows that Daqiu Village was willing to spend a great deal of 
money on news-gathering activities, and many of the reporters 
who gathered news in Daqiu Village might have also been "paid." 
<H5>  Like Other Commodities News Reporting Is Sold for a Price </H5>
  In another instance, when collecting evidence in the home of 
an enterprise manager who had committed the crime of 
profiteering, a court discovered that he had given 170,000 yuan 
in bribes to more than 20 newspapers, which had then written 
articles to sing his praises. 
  With regard to the recent Great Wall Group fraud case, 
television stations, central-level newspapers, and local 
newspapers all carried flattering reports during the process of 
the Great Wall Group's fund gathering, thereby helping the Great 
Wall Group establish credit in society. It is difficult say 
whether some deals were involved here. 
  Some local television stations even openly list prices, 
explicitly setting the standards for fees to be charged for 
various news reports. For instance, a news report on the holding 
of an enterprise meeting, the ordering of goods, or a product 
show will cost 500 yuan, while a five-minute feature story will 
cost 5,000 yuan. Even Professor Fang, who tended to speak rather 
gently, denounced such conduct as: shameless "prostitution." 
  According to Professor Fang, work in two areas has to be 
done 
in order to maintain journalists' professional ethics. One is to 
improve the benefits enjoyed by journalists; the other is to 
formulate the Press Law, creating a code of professional conduct 
for journalists. 
  The Press Law began to be formulated in 1980. Successively, 
the Journalism Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences, the Press and Publication Administration, and Hu Jiwei 
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress 
(dismissed after the June 4th Incident) each produced a plan; 
afterwards comparative study was also carried out. Nevertheless 
the law has yet to be enacted. 
  In recent years legal disputes involving news reporting have 
been on the rise. As there is not an effective law to define the 
related matters, sometimes cases are handled in accordance with 
criminal law, and more frequently cases are handled in 
accordance with civil law. 
  The lack of effort to construct the legal system governing 
the news-reporting industry is now a big problem in the 
development of journalism. 
<H5>  Yu Zuomin Bought a Journalism Prize With Money </H5>
  The third problem is the interference of capital. 
  The interference of some wealthy individuals in the 
news-reporting industry has adversely affected the taste of the 
news-reporting industry. Professor Fang cited some examples: 
Last year a nationwide contest of short news stories was held in 
Daqiu Village, and the expenses for the contest were paid for 
mainly by the "village chief," Yu Zuomin. 
  After the judging activity produced results, Yu Zuomin 
argued 
that a TIANJIN RIBAO report on Daqiu Village's donations for 
relief efforts in disaster-stricken regions should be awarded a 
prize. The judges believed that the report was of ordinary 
quality, and thus hesitated to some extent. As a consequence a 
very unhappy look passed over the face of Yu Zuomin who was 
powerful because of his wealth: "If this news report is not 
awarded a prize, this check will not be signed either." After 
repeated discussions, people succumbed to the will of Yu Zuomin, 
and the news report on Daqiu Village's donations was awarded the 
third prize. 
  In addition, some newspapers have accepted investments from 
collective enterprises; some newspapers sold some of their 
shares; and some newspapers sold rights over advertisement or 
advertisement spaces, which have then come to be controlled by 
advertising agencies. 
  Such situations are, in fact, commonplace in capitalist 
societies, but are doubtless new things in a socialist market 
economy. Professor Fang, a scholar, pointed out: Because of the 
interference of capital, sometimes contents are made to 
accommodate the market, resulting in the carrying of stories 
such as those of problems in marriages, crime-of-passion 
murders, and sensational crimes in society as well as 
pornographic pictures; consequently publications have become 
more vulgar. 
  Lastly, there are the problems that the volume of 
information 
is still too small, that there is a tendency to intentionally 
avoid negative stories, and that reporting is not timely enough. 
  During the effort to bid for the right to host the Olympics, 
the people of Beijing felt rather good about themselves. It was 
exactly because they had only seen their positive side, with 
reports being mostly positive, that their sense of failure was 
very profound at the time of defeat.

scholar in Germany: "Thaw Literature Struggles To Break Free 
From Ideology"] 
  [Text] Forty years of CPC rule on the mainland has 
destroyed more than cultural relics, physical landscape, and 
material production. Most catastrophic is the destruction it has 
wrought on China's fine tradition, more accurately, the best 
things in human tradition: Sound moral values and a robust 
ability to distinguish truth from falsehood. What makes it worse 
is that these statements apply not only to the masses, but also 
to intellectuals, and not just conservative intellectuals, but 
so-called advanced and radical intellectuals as well. Communist 
rule totally stripped almost two entire generations of 
intellectuals of a moral sense of honor and disgrace. This is 
precisely why the sins of the party remain unforgivable even 
after a thousand years. 
  As far as the mainland intellectual is concerned, upon 
re-entering the world following the political thaw, his foremost 
mission is to do some self-examination, regain his ability to 
think properly, and return to the right starting point. However, 
the developments in the past decade have not been totally 
satisfactory. What really accounts for this state of affairs? In 
my opinion, the most important reason is that people have lost 
their spirit of honest self-examination. The overwhelming 
majority of mainland intellectuals have grown accustomed to the 
dogmatic self-righteous Marxist way of criticizing the world. We 
cannot expect Chinese intellectuals to regain on their own the 
self-doubting spirit of the modern theory of knowledge 
overnight. Moreover, the mainland having been isolated for 
years, not only was there a lack of communication with the 
outside world, but the two generations of intellectuals have 
completely lost their foreign linguistic abilities. In the early 
days of openness, therefore, the mainland was a society with an 
extremely limited capacity for interacting with the rest of the 
world. Having said that, China is a vast country with much 
living space for the above-mentioned intellectuals. Moreover, 
eventually the world must wake up to China's existence. In a 
sense, therefore, international exchange had a negative result 
in that it encourages parochial arrogance, complacency, and 
conservatism among Chinese intellectuals. Third, because they 
speak the same language and with their capacity for healthy 
change that comes from being part of the world, Chinese 
intellectuals in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas should have 
been a powerful driving force and catalyst for change in the 
intellectual world on the mainland during this brief 
transitional period. That, however, has turned out to be wishful 
thinking. Instead, it is Hong Kong and Taiwan which are being 
engulfed in a wave of "mainland fever." Only a handful of 
insightful scholars have pointed out, politely, the errors of 
mainland intellectuals. But even they fail to understand why 
mainland intellectuals could have made such obvious mistakes. In 
reality, "mainland fever" points up some of the problems in Hong 
Kong, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese community. 
  "Mainland fever" has directly contributed to the apathy and 
arrogance of some mainland intellectuals. Even as the diehard 
faction of the CPC forced them out with guns following the 
collapse of the democracy movement in 1989, they still have not 
done any soul-searching or established any serious contacts with 
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese scholars during their 
visits to Taiwan and other countries in order to find out how 
the latter approach or research an issue. They remain engrossed 
in expansive specious arguments about the masculine principle 
and other stuff. Compare them to the human rights movement in 
Eastern Europe, to intellectuals like Havel and you see a most 
striking difference. 
  Ma Yueran [7456 1878 3544], a Swedish Sinologist, told 
Taiwan 
LIAN HE PAO reporters in October 1986 that no Chinese has ever 
won a Nobel Prize for literature primarily because of a 
translation problem. Ever since then, the confidence of mainland 
writers has been on the rise on a daily basis. Just about 
everyone believes he is world-class. How pertinent are Ma 
Yueran's comments? Or do they merely show that he still lacks a 
genuine feel for the Chinese language, that as a Sinologist he 
is on shaky ground as soon as he starts talking about poetry and 
literature? Be that as it may, because of his unique standing, 
his remarks had a big impact on the literary community in 
mainland China. What he said also raises such questions as: How 
should we look at mainland literature today? How should we 
interpret literature? I would like to discuss these questions by 
comparing contemporary Chinese literature to that of Eastern 
Europe because the new generation of writers and poets on the 
mainland that I know well, represented by TODAY, as well as 
myself have been deeply influenced by the thaw literature of 
Eastern Europe, especially the Soviet Union, as we were growing 
up in the early 1970's. Relying on nothing more than the 
translations of a handful of Eastern and Western European works 
that were supposedly for internal reference only, they slowly 
completed a major change in life, becoming in the process a more 
healthy force of the mainland intelligentsia in the 1980's. 
  If literature embodies the pursuit of man, great literature 
can come about even under centralized communist rule. This kind 
of literature also sheds light on the pursuit of eternity. It 
reveals for all to see the conflicts between man and society in 
this environment, the tragedy of human nature, and the price man 
pays for his conscience and ideals. Certainly, it takes courage 
and resolve to produce this kind of literature. The writer must 
be able to withstand the many forms of oppression, corrosion, 
and enslavement by the communist ideology, to the extent of 
sacrificing his own well-being and perhaps even his life. This 
is precisely the attribute of the current generation of Soviet 
writers. Without their suffering, their indomitable will, their 
efforts on behalf of the preservation of humanity, the Soviet 
Union could never have produced thaw literature, a great 
literature that transcends time and space. The glory of thaw 
literature is that it keeps alive and continues a great literary 
tradition and preserves the true pursuit of man. It has 
profoundly influenced not only contemporary Soviet society but 
also Soviet literature in the 1970's and 1980's, as well as the 
pursuit of human rights, democracy, and ideals by the Soviet 
people. Face to face with such literature, how can we not 
overflow with respect? How can we not examine our conscience? To 
defend our timidity in front of such literature only proves our 
own insignificance. 
<H5>  The Thawing of Chinese Literature </H5>
  Yet the same communist system, the same Marxist ideology has 
produced a very different literature and art on mainland China 
vis-a-vis that of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Instead 
of ignoring it, we should think long and hard about this 
distinction. 
  The foremost distinction between the mainland, on the one 
hand, and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, on the other, is 
that there has simply been no genuinely creative art and 
literature on the mainland since 1949. Set aside our sentimental 
ties to modern writers and survey the scene from a historical 
perspective level-headedly, and we can see that just about all 
literary works of this era are the mark of shame of their 
creators, the very proof of their servility, the aid they have 
given to the tyrant to do evil, and their ignorance. Even those 
so-called artists who were denounced and persecuted because of 
infighting within the CPC could not hide this kind of shame. 
  Since 1949 everything on the mainland--literature, painting, 
music, movies--has been thoroughly ideologized. Just about every 
work became a form of propaganda publicizing the dogmatic 
principles of the communist ideology. The "theme first" rule did 
nothing more than give pride of place to a bunch of dogmatic 
principles. All human impulses were suppressed and stifled. An 
artist or writer might change his method of creation, choosing 
between realism and romanticism, but he must subordinate himself 
to the dogma. In the course of subordinating himself to the 
dogma, romanticism was looked upon less favorably than realism. 
Yet modernist art has never successfully found a foothold for 
itself in any communist nation because its core conflicts with 
the dogmatic principles. Not that the dogma is immutable, of 
course. In the 1950's, it was the Great Leap Forward and 
"socialism is good." In the 1960's, it was the anti-right 
tendency and class struggle. In the 1970's, it was "criticize 
Lin Biao [2651 1735] and Confucius" and the "Cultural Revolution 
is good." In the 1980's, it was reform and the open policy. 
While some principles are mutually contradictory, it does not 
mean that they are not ideologized works. Highly representative 
in this aspect are Zhang Yinliang [1728 6343 0081], the 
so-called famous mainland writer, and Xie Jin [6200 2516], the 
film director. Neither scar literature nor a majority of works 
of the 1980's which advocated reform and opening up basically 
broke free from this mold. 
  Existing side by side with this kind of propaganda were the 
subservience and shameless obsequiousness of writers and artists 
to the CPC and a handful of CPC leaders. Their ingratiation 
pervaded almost all their so-called artistic works, their 
humanity and dignity utterly lost. They sang the praise of Mao 
Zedong and CPC in the 1950's and added Lin Biao and the Cultural 
Revolution to the list in the 1960's. In the 1970's they lauded 
Zhou Enlai and, in the 1980's, Deng Xiaoping and the reform 
faction. From writers who rode high such as Guo Meiruo [6753 
3106 5387], Mao Dun [5403 4163], and Cao Yu [2580 4417] to those 
who were persecuted to death like Ding Ling [0002 3781], Tian 
Han [3944 3352] and Lao She [5071 5287], they all behaved in a 
revolting manner. 
  To explain this phenomenon, we need to do more than compare 
the relative brutality of different communist parties. This is 
because it is hard to prove who was more brutal, Stalin, Mao 
Zedong, or Deng Xiaoping. When good rises one foot, evil rises 
ten feet. Others say, when evil rises one foot, good rises ten 
feet. There are uniquely Chinese factors behind this phenomenon. 
I think the foremost reason is that the Chinese literary 
tradition is still highly fragile. Although it has produced a 
number of writers of a high caliber since the 1920's and 1930's, 
in overall qualitative and quantitative terms Chinese literature 
is no match for its Soviet and Eastern European counterparts. 
Judging from the way they deal with the pursuit of man at a 
deeper level from a modern angle, only a tiny handful of Chinese 
writers such as Lu Xun [7627 3065] are in the same league as 
great Russian writers with a pioneering spirit. The pain and 
impulses of the majority of writers are still not intense or 
profound enough. In a certain sense, the very fact that many 
intellectuals sided in the 1930's and 1940's points up their 
weak foundation. All this explains why the artistic and literary 
community utterly failed to stand up to bad Stalinist literature 
after 1949. 
  Another important reason the literary and artistic thought 
of 
Stalin, Zhdanov, and Mao Zedong managed to march straight into 
China and ride roughshod over it is that the older generation of 
intellectuals did not have a firm philosophy of life or moral 
values. Besides the writers mentioned above, also guilty were 
Zang Kejia [5258 0344 1367], Feng Xuefeng [7458 7185 1496] and 
even Wang Meng [3769 5536]. A tiniest handful of writers with 
the least bit of conscience either stopped writing or did some 
translation, there being no other choice. Even then they were 
criticized and persecuted to death. One example was Mr. Fu Lei 
[0265 7191]. The ideologization off literature on the mainland 
went totally unchallenged and true literature and the true 
pursuit of man almost vanished without a trace. 
  One of the most insidious consequences of the ideologization 
of literature is that it rendered almost two generations 
essentially ignorant of true literature. For three full decades, 
art and literature on the mainland were fully ideologized, 
people lost their ability to distinguish between truth and 
falsehood, good and evil, and all human impulses and pursuits 
were ideologized. Herein lies one reason why human nature on the 
mainland has been distorted, something which many people have 
found it hard to understand. A much-discussed topic in recent 
years is the "impotence" of mainland intellectuals. In reality 
the problem with the current generation of writers and artists 
is "castration," not just "impotence." And this brings us to the 
second major distinction between the mainland and Eastern 
Europe: While the thawing of literature has produced a great 
thaw literature in Eastern Europe, the thawing of literature on 
the mainland only means that literature is being removed from 
politics and ideology and enters a transition to true literature. 
  The break from the intra-party line struggle and the pursuit 
of the liberation of man first began on the Democracy Wall at 
Xidan in Beijing in 1979. A handful of young literary and 
artistic workers represented by TODAY and the "Xingxing" art 
show introduced a breath of fresh air into China's literary 
world. A break was made with the past three decades and a new 
exploration was on. This process can be traced all the way to 
the early 1970's. At that time the CPC was playing tricks left 
and right with no attempt at all to cover up its deception. For 
their part, the writers were in the midst of their transition 
from adolescence, having gone through the frustration of being 
sent to work in the countryside and mountain areas. It was in 
that culturally barren era that they stumbled upon a host of 
translated works intended for internal criticism, the so-called 
"yellow books" and "grey books." (The covers of these titles 
were either yellow, in the case of works on art and literature, 
or grey, in the case of books on politics, economics, history, 
and philosophy.) Among them were modern Western classics by such 
writers as Sartre and Jia Miu [0502 6208] along with a large 
collection of so-called revisionist writings and other works of 
thaw literature from Eastern Europe. As they read and copied the 
new literature, the writers gradually found a new direction. It 
is undeniable of course that three decades of CPC education had 
left a deep scar and created many shortcomings that cannot be 
corrected. 
<H5>  Inherent Weaknesses Of Mainland Writers </H5>
  Energized by the new literature, the world of letters on the 
mainland showed a trace of life in the early 1980's. However, 
except for a handful of works by some writers typified by TODAY, 
the so-called introspection writings remained ideologized. The 
only thing that had changed was the title. In sharp contrast to 
the thaw literature of the Soviet Union, which demonstrated an 
individualism, personal rebellion and the pursuit of the 
liberation of man, most works limited themselves to criticizing 
so-called bad elements in the party and waxed nostalgic for the 
other ideology of the CPC. This is true of many works celebrated 
in literary circles both at home and abroad, for example, 
"Mid-Life Crisis" by Chen Rong [6186 1369] and "Man, O Man" by 
Dai Houying [2071 0624 5391]. Mr. Bai Yang [2672 2799] praised 
Chen Rong's "Mid-Life Crisis" but a Polish writer read it and 
made this pertinent comment, "It is the communist party. Chen 
Rong wrote his novel the way he did to execute the CPC's current 
party policy on intellectuals." (Bai Yang, "Dueling Words," 
Linbai Chubanshe, Taiwan, 1990, p 185) Another good example is 
Mr. Liu Binyan [0491 6333 7159]. Maybe we should say Mr. Liu 
Binyan is a better representative of this generation of writers. 
Let us just cite one instance to illustrate this generation's 
misunderstanding of literature. In the mid-1980's, Mr. Liu 
Binyan more than once criticized the pursuit by young writers of 
pure art, denouncing the anti-political tendency among young 
people and their literature-for-literature's-sake attitude and 
urging them to orient themselves to reality and society. His 
criticisms, we must say, were way off the mark. Literature for 
the sake of literature was precisely a sign of the loathing for 
and resistance to the politicization and ideologization of 
literature by the CPC. As such it presented progress. There is 
an essential difference between socially concerned writers, on 
the one hand, and politicians, propagandists, and agitators, on 
the other. Writers are interested in human concerns, in the 
human spirit and soul, at a deeper level. When the new literary 
tradition takes shape and finds its place into our hearts, every 
faction of the CPC would lose its appeal and every form of 
dictatorship and every kind of enslavement of humanity would run 
into stiff resistance. The bias of Liu Binyan and other writers 
of the older generation precisely reflect how the CPC has 
distorted the human spirit. What is said about Liu Binyan can be 
applied to Liu Zaifu [0491 0375 1788], the other well-known 
literary critic on the mainland. Despite his sharp verbal 
exchanges with conservative literary theorists and despite some 
new terminology, he had yet to make a clean break with the 
Marxist ideology, judging from his cooperative style of writing, 
his writing techniques, his line of reasoning, and his methods 
of verifying an argument. Be that as it may, we were overwhelmed 
with respect for them because they gave their heart and soul to 
the struggle with the conservatives. It was this internal 
vehement resistance, along with the open policy, that gradually 
gave rise to new true literary works. Through the cracks of 
intra-party struggles a new literature and true humanity slowly 
matured. The literary and artistic front, we should say, is the 
most promising territory for the mainland intelligentsia. In the 
late 1980's a healthy literary trend gradually took shape on the 
mainland. Nevertheless, because of the generation gap created by 
CPC rule and the inherent weaknesses of several generations, the 
new literature may not achieve overnight success. The eagerness 
for quick success and instant gains and the craving for the 
grandiose and pompous derived from a shallow foundation and 
parochial arrogance and self-righteousness, both the byproducts 
of CPC-imposed cultural isolation, continue to make themselves 
felt often, preventing people from facing the world honestly and 
examining themselves truly and deeply. 
  Even as the mainland began its pursuit of true art and 
literature starting in the mid-1980's, non-literary and 
non-artistic tendencies could be found everywhere. Imitation was 
omnipresent, from literary genre to the way a writer carried 
himself. There was no individuality, no real depth. You may say 
imitation is quite harmless; coupled with arrogance, however, it 
becomes downright dangerous. This phenomenon pervaded the world 
of letters on the mainland in the 1980's. Zhang Zhengzhi [1728 
2110 1807], for instance, imitated Aitematov but fell short. As 
for writers in the Wang Shuo [3769 2592] mold, the Soviet Union 
produced Akeksiaonov over 20 years ago. Those Chinese writers 
searching for their roots were imitating black American writers. 
"The person who writes expansively," a fashionable term used by 
Bai Hua [4101 2901] and others, was lifted from a line in the 
poem "Man" by the Soviet poet Meierlatelumu [phonetic], 
translated from Russian in the 1960's and published for internal 
circulation. Everybody was quietly influenced by it, even the 
style of the illustrations in the "Stepping Into the Future" 
series, but China could offer nothing that matches its 
profundity. As for people like Zhang Yinliang, they are still 
mired in ideology and formulism, still a long way from producing 
anything that resembles true literature. Whatever the mainland 
produces, we can say, others have produced a long time ago and 
of a higher quality too. Mr. Li Oufan [2621 2962 2753] hit the 
nail on the head when he said in late 1988, "We have yet to 
produce truly moving works. Look what happened elsewhere. The 
way Kundera, the exiled Czech writer, described the party and 
revolution in his fiction, the reportages by Normal Mailer, the 
American writer, during the Vietnam War... That sort of thing is 
still a no-no in China today. I have always argued that China 
does not lack the materials for great works. What it does lack 
is writers of insight, courage, conscience, and artistic 
talents. It all boils down to a question of vision and language. 
  The long years from the anti-right struggle to the Cultural 
Revolution and the shadow upon shadow it cast on the psychology 
of the Chinese people have left behind scars and, underneath 
them, guilt. The foibles and blemishes of the Chinese national 
character were fully revealed. Why hasn't a single writer so far 
laid bare this big scar thoroughly and mercilessly? Following 
the Holocaust, Jews produced countess literary works. Just about 
everyone of them both chronicled historical facts and delved 
into human feelings. In their soul-searching, the Chinese have 
not made their way back to the Cultural Revolution, instead just 
talking loosely about "feudal residues." To me that is escaping 
one's responsibility. China's traditional culture has its 
convoluted and dark aspects, but the new psychological residues 
created in the 30 years after liberation should not be allowed 
to take shelter behind something sweepingly called "feudalism 
and tradition." (JIUSHI NIANDAI, No 12, 1986, p 81) 
  These non-literary and non-artistic tendencies also 
exhibited 
themselves in music and movies. Since 1980, the musical world on 
the mainland has become increasingly interested in and even 
obsessed with their rankings in a variety of international 
musical competitions, both vocal and instrumental. In 1988 they 
even took out a whole-page ad on the back cover of the 
Chinese-language magazine ZHISHI FENZI published in the United 
States. In the ad they characterized a coming concert in the 
United States featuring mainland musicians as a challenge by 
Chinese music to the West. This tendency worried none other than 
the great violinist, Yehudi Menuhin, who wrote to his Chinese 
friends, "The danger lies in trying too hard to develop 
top-notch musical talent of an international caliber too 
quickly. They want their musicians to excel the way their 
athletes overpower their opponents at international sporting 
events. But great musical performances are not like athletic 
competitions. Music is unique, individual. It cannot be 
quantified in terms of distance, speed, force, or weight. There 
can be no Olympic champion in music. Our goal is not to defeat 
others in world competitions, but to wholeheartedly demonstrate 
the art we have learned." Indeed, if music is not just a hobby 
but an echo of our pursuit of life, if we still remember great 
maestros such as Beethoven, then slogans like Chinese music is 
challenging the West is musical blasphemy. 
  Something similar is happening in the movie industry. From 
the beginning, the younger generation of directors such as Zhang 
Yimou [1728 5669 6180] has been driven precisely by a desire to 
win awards in international competitions. To the extent that 
this involves a departure from and resistance to past formulism 
and ideologization, it is not a bad thing; at a minimum it 
represents a big improvement upon those who stick to old ways 
and refuse to change. But in terms of art for art's sake, we 
think the spirit of an artist is missing from this generation of 
directors. So in just about every literary and artistic arena 
countless people are desperately searching for or resorting to 
new formats. Others make much of China's national conditions and 
customs, things not found elsewhere. But in philosophical and 
emotional intensity and scope, they still are a far cry from art 
and literature in Eastern Europe. We now have decent works and 
even prize-winning works, but we have yet to produce writers and 
works that really have depth. This is a fact of life today. 
  There is a mix of reasons why we have thus far failed to 
produce works and writers that have real depth. The foremost 
explanation is that we lack individuals who have an artist's 
spirit. In real life it is difficult to really hide oneself 
totally. Compare the works of mainland writers to those of their 
Eastern European counterparts like Havel and Kundera and the 
former always comes up short, whether we are looking at their 
portrayal of daily life, description of political turmoil, or 
their sheer powerfulness. 
  Another important reason why the mainland has not produced 
some truly profound works and writers is that Chinese writers 
have inherent weaknesses. The old educational system and 
cultural environment on the mainland predetermine their 
narrowness of vision and inadequate literary training. They lack 
a knowledge of history, a sense of history. They either have 
trouble understanding original philosophical texts or simply 
have never read them. They lack linguistic skills, whether 
Chinese or foreign, relying solely on translated works, which 
severely limits their access to other literary works and the 
nurturing derived therefrom. Given these circumstances, they 
could not but find it hard to transcend their environment. This 
is another reason why the current generation of writers is no 
match for the generation of poets and writers represented by Xu 
Zhimo [1776 1807 2302], Dai Wangshu [2071 2598 5289], Shen 
Congwen [3088 1783 2429], and Lu Xun. In the era of the thaw 
literature, current Chinese writers perhaps need to go back to 
the 1930's to obtain a true understanding of the history of 
Chinese literature and art. We have no justifiable excuses but 
we do have shameful facts. We must start from ground zero in 
earnest.

  [Text] The incident of Ming Pao reporter Hsi Yang took 
place after the incident of Kuai Pao reporter Liang Huimin in 
November 1992, and was another incident in which the arrest of a 
reporter led to strong repercussions. 
<H5>  Widespread Leaks by Small Newspapers </H5>
  Whether or not Hsi Yang was really engaged in activity 
incompatible with his status as a reporter, and whether or not 
facts about the incident have been concealed, the outside world 
cannot know. But in all fairness, the "criminal evidence" 
revealed by the government about Hsi Yang is about two economic 
news items, which is very difficult to link to "national 
security" and "state secrets." Two of the "secrets" were fairly 
inconspicuous news items that appeared in Ming Pao in May and 
July and were said to be harmful to national security, which is 
very farfetched. 
  In recent years, one could say that news of the inner 
workings and so forth of many economic policies and reform 
measures, which have been far more sensitive than the 
above-mentioned news items, has spread far and wide. Many 
domestic publications, such as JINGJI CANKAO BAO, BEIFANG 
SHIBAO, ZUZHI RENSHI BAO and other semi-official newspapers, 
have frequently revealed materials relating to economic reform 
policy, and even materials as politically sensitive as trade 
policy documents that have not yet been announced. These 
publications can be easily purchased by Hong Kong reporters or 
tourists who are visiting the mainland. Furthermore, amid 
international concern over human rights, national security 
departments should not take such drastic measures just because 
of a few lines that appeared in a Hong Kong publication a few 
months ago. However, how is it that another Hong Kong reporter 
has stepped on the "land mine" within less than year? How is it 
that Communist China has again self-righteously and with 
criminal evidence in hand clubbed an outside reporter? 
<H5>  Internal Preventive Measures Have Been Strengthened </H5>
  Last year, after the incident of the Kuai Pao reporter Liang 
Huimin, China's security and propaganda departments issued an 
internal memo. The memo severely criticized and reprimanded 
party and government cadres at all levels who ignored the 
principles of national security and legality and provided 
opportunities for outside reporters to steal secrets during the 
historic reforms and opening up. It also reprimanded "a very 
small number of our own news media who sold state secrets for 
profit." As a result, Communist China's security departments 
clearly redefined the general policy on news gathering by 
outside reporters in China: "We must uphold reform and opening 
up and make friends far and wide, and facilitate normal news 
gathering work, and thereby actively provide guidance." However, 
we must also "strengthen limits and reduce negative effects," 
and, in particular, regarding those targeted by the security 
departments "we must mercilessly expose and attack the very 
small number of unscrupulous people (reporters) who steal state 
secrets and violate national laws." This internal memo instructs 
the national security enforcement divisions to "select suitable 
targets and select suitable methods" to "expose" the "illegal 
activities" of foreign reporters to "intimidate" outside 
reporters. 
  As an illustration of this memo, Beijing's public security 
department sentenced Xinhua reporter Wu Shisheng, a suspect in 
the Liang Huimin case, to life imprisonment, and sentenced Wu's 
wife, Ma Tao, to six months in prison. This case raised concerns 
in legal and media circles in China and abroad. This time, Xi 
Yang is another target under attack as an outside reporter who 
"acted improperly." 
<H5>  Restrictions Have Tightened, News Gathering Is Difficult </H5>
  The mainland propaganda departments' emphasis on the "angle 
of the news" is in a nutshell: "Report only the good news; 
reporting of bad news is prohibited." If this is violated and 
the violation is light, you must be investigated and cleared; if 
it is serious, you lose your position and publication is 
stopped. This is fundamentally different from the "freedom of 
the press" enjoyed outside. When Hong Kong reporters go to the 
mainland, with the exception of hot news items, they all find 
ways to dig out their own "exclusives" or "inside sources" to 
meet the needs of commercial competition among publications. 
Therefore, there are inevitably people who "go too fast" or 
"apply too much energy" and violate the taboo. Furthermore, it 
is a fact that some people will pay a monetary price to get 
news. There is only a fine line between "news" and 
"intelligence." Therefore, it is difficult for outside reporters 
in China to avoid stepping on the "mine field." 
  There are other factors that make it difficult for Hong Kong 
reporters to gather news on the mainland. First, since the 
practice of giving news briefings began, all important news is 
announced through formal official channels, which therefore 
increases the transparency of the news. Second, widespread trade 
and commercial activities have led to the dissemination abroad, 
through various channels, of social news from all over the 
mainland. As a result, in recent years the reports in the Hong 
Kong and Taiwan media concerning mainland social problems have 
been numerous and detailed. Third, since 1990, the burgeoning 
"corps of writers" in Beijing, Shanghai and other large cities 
who work for outside publications are mostly active persons with 
many sources of information. The rumors and gossip they hear 
rival the special reports of reporters. 
  All of these factors undoubtedly create pressure on the 
reporters and media members from abroad. They compete within 
their profession using only standard news gathering methods. 
Therefore, they must resort to developing their own sources of 
information. News gathering is not only tedious and exhausting, 
but you cannot limit your means or your price to gather news. 
Those in the media cannot deny this point. 
<H5>  Developing New Sources of News </H5>
  Xi Yang, a native of Beijing, is a new immigrant who 
obtained 
a one-way permit to Hong Kong in the late 1980s. As a person 
with a mainland background gathering news from the mainland, Xi 
Yang was not a rarity. In fact, there are quite a few reporters 
with mainland backgrounds who are on the mainland under various 
pretexts carrying out news gathering activities without official 
permission. This has created an amusing result: If you openly 
apply to gather news on the mainland, your results are limited, 
whereas working in private, under the guise of visiting 
relatives, sightseeing and visiting friends, you can get 
impressive results. This is the reason that some news media are 
happy to hire as reporters people in Hong Kong who are 
originally from the mainland. When they return to the mainland 
to gather news, they get twice the results with half the work 
compared to those born and raised in Hong Kong who go to the 
mainland. 
  Hong Kong reporters who return to visit relatives or friends 
on the mainland can find, either intentionally or 
unintentionally, all kinds of sources of newsworthy materials. 
  First, by widely contacting relatives, old schoolmates and 
former colleagues, they can learn different views and gather 
different news from different levels of society and different 
professions, and this is very helpful in portraying certain 
political incidents and major social activities. 
  Second, by choosing friends who hold leading positions or 
sensitive jobs and by establishing personal relations, they can 
have more direct access to news or more direct access to people 
in high positions. In recent years, there have been frequent 
news disclosures about previously unrevealed places on the 
mainland, such as prisons and labor camps, and many of these 
disclosures have been made possible by opportunities to 
interview and photograph through private channels. 
  Third, reporters visiting relatives and friends on the 
mainland will inevitably have money and exchange goods, gifts or 
banquets, which used to be considered normal relations. Mainland 
cadres often make material demands on friends from abroad, and 
often give materials or internal information in exchange. 
  Whether international or unintentional, once a "leaking 
situation" is exposed, these activities by outside reporters 
inevitably become "criminal evidence" used by the public 
security and pubic safety departments. Normal banquets and gifts 
can become evidence of "bribery," and conversations between 
friends can become "spying." The reason why the Xi Yang incident 
has aroused the attention and concern of the Hong Kong media is 
that the public security departments have not made very definite 
and detailed announcements, and their charges are murky. 
Concerned department should clearly define the difference 
between "secrets" and "news." 
<H3>  Reducing Levels of Secrecy; Outside Is Relaxed, Inside Is 
Tight </H3>
  At the beginning of this year, the National Security Bureau 
decided to carry out necessary reforms of the national security 
system to meet the needs of the economic reforms. Hundreds of 
thousands of secret documents from central to local governments 
were declassified, and they redefined the standards of security 
classification. This was publicized in the official weekly 
Liaowang, and the article emphasized that "even though secrecy 
classification has been reduced, the maintenance of secrecy must 
be further reinforced." 
  The main target of this prevention of leaks is outside 
reporters. The State Council's memos concerning "Reinforcing the 
Management of Foreign Reporters" and the "Regulations Governing 
Foreign Reporters and Foreign News Organizations" were 
disseminated to the county and regiment levels, requiring 
leaders at all levels to comply. There are clear guidelines 
regarding the approval of applications by foreign reporters to 
visit, and regarding which groups of applicants must be refused. 
In addition, the documents require that the receiving unit must 
"provide designated guides throughout the entire visit," that 
information on all activities of foreign reporters must be 
gathered, and that the management of outside reporters should be 
"relaxed on the outside, tight on the inside." Any foreign 
reporters singled out by security departments and placed on a 
blacklist will be put under the "supervision" of the security 
departments from the time they enter China, and all their 
activities and contacts will be recorded. The eyes and ears of 
the security departments are everywhere. They might be service 
workers in the hotels, they might be officials of community 
organizations and they could be your mainland counterparts who 
are working alongside you. 
  A worker in the Guangzhou customs office admitted that 
because there is no comprehensive computer network, there are 
large holes in the information about incoming reporters. Aside 
from a few people who are on the security department's 
blacklist, ordinary incoming reporters usually are not easily 
controlled by the State Security Bureau. Furthermore, more and 
more points of entry are being opened up on the mainland, and 
concerned departments cannot in a timely fashion monitor 
incoming reporters' activities. But as soon as you step on the 
"land mine," you become a new target. 
<H5>  A Planned Crackdown on the Hong Kong Media </H5>
  It is naive to think that after 1997 the freedom of the 
press 
in Hong Kong will not be interfered with by Communist China or 
the government of the special zone. As everyone knows, Beijing 
has already done extensive studies of the Hong Kong media in 
preparation for formulating policies governing Hong Kong's news 
media and the arts, and to provide materials to take over the 
arena of public opinion in Hong Kong. In the late transitional 
stage, the general direction of the propaganda is to "maintain a 
foothold in two newspapers, expand the base, unite the struggle 
and attack key targets." The so-called "two newspapers" are Wen 
Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao. "Expand the base" refers to a number of 
officially colored publications continuously published by 
Communist China in Hong Kong, such as Zi Jing, Zhonghua Wenzhe, 
Gangao Dongtai and so forth, which are put out at great expense. 
"Attack key targets" refers to the abovementioned memos' "select 
opportune moments, select suitable targets and select suitable 
methods" to make a "frightening attack." 
  The Xi Yang incident happened during the national security 
conference, and the prevention of secret-stealing by foreign 
reporters was originally one of the key topics of the 
conference. Therefore, the choice of Xi Yang as a target was 
very well-timed, and the so-called "state secrets" and the fact 
that "an open hearing could not be conducted" were merely 
bargaining chips in the hands of the government. After Kuai Pao, 
Ming Pao became another target of punishment. 
  In the 3d plenary session of the 7th National People's 
Congress, the criminal code was amended to increase the penalty 
for stealing national secrets, from under five years in prison 
to death. Liang Huimin of Kuai Pao could have been given a heavy 
sentence, but was magnanimously released. This shows that 
criminal justice is a bargaining chip in the hands of Communist 
China. 
  After the Xi Yang incident, this writer made inquiries to 
friends in Beijing several times. An official of the city public 
security department who understands the case refused to comment 
on the facts of the case, but one sentence revealed all: "It 
mainly depends on the attitude of the person." From this we can 
conclude that the official statement saying that Xi Yang has 
already "freely admitted the stealing of secrets," and that the 
Ming Pao chief's attitude changed from "firmly believing in Xi 
Yang's innocence" to a reversal on 10 October that clearly 
admitted Xi Yang's "mistaken" violation of the law, and an 
expression of regret, indicate that Communist China can deal 
with this case using the Liang Huimin model at any time, and the 
entire incident can be resolved. Whatever happens, it not only 
resulted in the effect of "killing the chicken to scare the 
monkey," but it was also one strike against Ming Pao. Therefore, 
the national security department is apparently the winner, and 
is also able to avoid criticism from overseas on the basis of 
human rights. 
  The question is, whose turn is it next time?

"Public Opinion Poll Sponsored by Magazine Revealed Patten's 
Policy Speech Fairly Well Accepted"] 
  [Excerpt] According to a public opinion poll sponsored by 
this magazine, a majority of Hong Kong residents considered 
Patten's second policy speech fairly acceptable. The proportion 
of those who were generally satisfied with the speech exceeded 
the proportion of dissatisfied. [passage omitted] 
  One-third of those interviewed felt that the Patten's speech 
should be helpful to the Sino-British talks later, and only 
one-fifth of the sample felt that it would not help these talks 
later. 
  Three-tenths of those interviewed considered that Britain 
had 
made some concessions under pressure from the PRC, but there was 
also one-quarter of the sample who did not feel that concessions 
had been made. 
  One of the major concession Britain can make would be 
reducing the number of persons elected on a functionally 
differentiated basis. Close to four-tenths of the respondents 
felt that Patten should not make such a concession, but there 
was also one-quarter who felt that he should so concede. 
  As for Patten's insistence that there should be objective 
criteria for the through train issue, more than one-half of 
those interviewed expressed concurrence. 
  But, with regard to the fact that Patten did not spell out 
his political reform proposals in this policy speech, a majority 
of those interviewed were indifferent, and only around one-third 
of the sample expressed dissatisfaction over this point. 
  The following are the responses to the questions by the Hong 
Kong residents interviewed in the sample.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhou Wei (0719 4850): "Third Plenary Session </F>
Gets Favorable Reviews in Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] The 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee was held in Beijing on 11 November as the whole world 
watched. The Hong Kong economy is so intimately linked to its 
Chinese counterpart that they sink or swim together. Moreover, 
the meeting took place as the fast-growing Chinese economy 
successfully pulled off a "soft-landing," meaning that it has 
been able to grow rapidly yet steadily. Economic reform in China 
too has been enormously successful and is about to enter the 
most critical phase, which will be a shot in the arm for the 
Hong Kong economy. For all these reasons, the meeting naturally 
attracted the utmost interest in Hong Kong. During the past 
month, the Hong Kong media printed article after article on the 
convening of the 3d Plenary Session, analyzing, discussing, and 
speculating on what new measures the Chinese would take to 
develop the market economy and deepen reform. 
<H5>  An Immensely Significant Document </H5>
  It is widely agreed in Hong Kong's economic and theoretical 
circles and among people in the media that the plenary session 
was being held at an opportune time. The "Decision on Certain 
Issues Relating to the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economy," which was discussed at the meeting, is an enormously 
significant programmatic document. It offers a penetrating 
analysis and clear exposition of a string of important 
ideological and theoretical issues relating to the development 
of the Chinese economy and the deepening of reform in the next 
stage. It achieves a consensus and lays down important decisions 
on how to create a basic framework for a socialist market 
economy by zeroing in on the essential areas. It will certainly 
push economic development to a new high, the most basic 
guarantee of the long-term and steady development of the Hong 
Kong economy and its prosperity. 
  To establish a socialist market economy, the 3d Plenary 
Session called for the deepening of reform in a wide range of 
areas, including banking, financial administration and taxation, 
investment, foreign trade, state enterprises, social security, 
agriculture, and scientific and technical education. Essentially 
it will include, first of all, the reform of the microeconomy, 
specifically changing the operating mechanism of state 
enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system. Second, 
it involves reforming, nurturing, and developing the market 
system, particularly the acceleration of the maturation and 
perfection of the capital goods market. Third, it involves 
reform at the level of macroeconomic regulation and control, 
specifically changing government functions and establishing a 
macroeconomic regulatory and control system for these sectors: 
banking, finance, prices, investment, foreign exchange, and 
social security. For the moment the most important and urgent 
thing is to achieve a breakthrough in banking and financial and 
tax administration by creating a new banking and tax system and 
operating mechanism. The reason is that "banking is the 
lifeblood of the market economy" while financial administration 
and taxation directly determine the ability of the central 
government to regulate and control the macroeconomy. 
  The local media are fully aware of the enormous effort that 
has gone into the deliberations over and drafting of this 
document. We can be quite sure it is the distillation of the 
experiences of 15 years of reform and the wisdom of people of 
all quarters, starting with Deng Xiaoping's reform philosophy. 
CPC leaders personally conducted numerous studies and surveys in 
various locations, carried out ideological work at the local 
level, and repeatedly spoke publicly about his thought and his 
ideas on deepening reform. The 3d Plenary Session was preceded 
by the publication of the Volume 3 of Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, which provided full ideological preparation 
for the drafting of the programmatic document. Public opinion 
too was fully prepared for what the document would include. 
During the drafting process, the opinions of high-ranking 
figures both inside and outside the party were solicited again 
and again in hopes of reaching a consensus. It went through 10 
drafts in all. For these reasons, the document is highly 
practicable and theoretical. It is a programmatic document on 
modern Chinese construction, its place in history comparable to 
that of the "Decision on Economic Reform" adopted by the 3d 
Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee in 1984. 
<H5>  Economic Development Both Rapid and Stable </H5>
  On the eve of the 3d Plenary Session, numerous newspapers in 
Hong Kong printed "Highlights of Deng Xiaoping's Speeches 
Delivered in Wuchang, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shanghai" in early 
1992. Deng Xiaoping emphasized in his speeches that "development 
is the only way to go." "Grasp the opportunity; develop 
ourselves." "The key is economic development." "Don't stand in 
the way of places which are capable of development." "Places 
where conditions are ripe should try to develop a little 
faster." The media consider all this of profound importance as 
it further unifies public understanding of the issue of growth 
rate and determines the direction in which China should move 
forward. Besides, it has been a big morale booster to the people 
of Hong Kong. At a time when Sino-British political talks have 
yet to produce an agreement and China is tightening 
macroeconomic regulation and control in an effort to cool the 
economy, Hong Kong investments in the mainland continue to rise 
and U.S. and Japanese capital keeps flowing into Hong Kong in 
large quantities in preparation for the big push into China, in 
the process driving up share prices sharply on the Hong Kong 
stock market. The media take this as a vote of confidence in the 
Chinese economy, a sign that the Chinese economy will continue 
its fast growth after the 3d Plenary Session, its prospects 
getting more and more attractive. 
  Even as they are convinced of fast economic growth ahead for 
China, some local scholars note that the number one issue facing 
China today is stability. Economic growth must be stable as well 
as fast; only stable growth can be true, fast growth. Will the 
Chinese economy become overheated again in the future? Will the 
scale of investment expand mindlessly again? Will there be an 
upsurge in inflation? These problems concern them. They believe 
that as long as China does not have an effective restraining 
mechanism and risk mechanism, their recurrence is inevitable. 
Hence the overriding importance of maintaining economic 
stability. Some scholars even argue that an annual growth rate 
of 7 or 8 percent is good enough and that China should not 
pursue double-digit growth in order to steer clear of the 
boom-and-bust cycle and the resultant heavy losses. 
  Earlier some people portrayed macroeconomic regulation and 
control and accelerated development, even accelerated reform, as 
mutually exclusive. They would have you believe that it was a 
mistake to tighten macroeconomic regulation and control. Many 
local experts do not share this point of view because, first of 
all, macroeconomic regulation and control can be found in all 
countries that have a market economy. Since China is in the 
midst of a transition from the old economic system to the new, 
the need for macroeconomic regulation and control is even 
greater. Second, macroeconomic regulation and control has indeed 
been highly effective. Had the government not imposed the 
earlier round of controls, instead allowing the financial sector 
to drift into chaos, inflation to worsen, and the exchange rate 
to plunge, both economic development and the effort to deepen 
reform would have been badly hindered. Thirdly, China's top 
priority now is to carry through with macroeconomic regulation 
and control to hold down inflation, trim the trade deficit, 
improve the economic structure, and boost government revenue, 
thus setting the stage for the continuous development of the 
economy and the deepening of reform. 
<H5>  It Takes Time To Establish Market Economy </H5>
  The local economic and theoretical circles are highly 
hopeful 
that the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
would bring about a breakthrough in economic reform. Economic 
structural reform in the last 15 years has been a huge success 
and laid a solid foundation, thanks to incremental reform of the 
past. The practice of advancing gradually and steadily is 
consistent with China's national conditions. In rural reform, in 
particular, spectacular breakthroughs have been made in price 
reform and opening to the outside world. Some scholars describe 
past reform as following a "roundabout strategy" and argue that 
it has been limited to matters of "secondary" importance. Not 
true in fact. Take price reform, for instance. You cannot say it 
is "secondary." Price reform, a big success story of the past 
few years, has always been billed as the "key" to successful 
reform. Today, we may say, the "fortress" of price reform has 
been captured. In the next stage of reform, we must launch an 
offensive against the other "fortresses" of the planned economy 
in an effort to create a full-fledged market economy. 
  Be that as it may, some Hong Kong scholars have some 
misgivings about "accelerated reform." Would "targeted 
breakthrough" become "shock therapy?" While acceleration is 
necessary, they believe, we must not go after instant success. 
The reason is that China will find the pain of radical change 
unbearable. Once things get out of hand, the consequences will 
be catastrophic. A market economy cannot materialize overnight; 
it takes a lengthy process of maturation, growth, and 
improvement. Other scholars argue that 15 years of reform have 
given us a wealth of experience and the national economy has 
developed to a point where it can withstand a good deal of 
stress. In the future, when it comes to reform we should move 
quickly whenever possible. The idea is to bring about a change 
with one move in order to reduce the conflicts that occur as the 
old order gives way to the new and the resultant losses. 
Needless to say, wherever quick action is impossible, we must 
stick to the incremental approach and carry out reform step by 
step. 
<H5>  Work Hard To Develop Primary Industries </H5>
  The People's Bank of China announced recently that because 
macroeconomic regulation and control has gone well, the state of 
banking in China has improved and is gradually returning to 
normal. This is good news to the people of Hong Kong because it 
suggests a Chinese economy that is growing rapidly, steadily, 
and healthily, creating a favorable climate for Hong Kong to 
invest in the mainland and bolster its imports and exports. 
  Structural imbalances, Jiang Zemin [3068 3419 3046] pointed 
out recently, are one of the major barriers to accelerating the 
Chinese economy. It is the hope of the Hong Kong economic 
community that in the days ahead China will make the correction 
of structural imbalances its top economic priority by 
concentrating its energies on the development of primary 
industries and the infrastructure, expediting the development of 
the transportation, communications, telecommunications, and 
energy industries and other important raw material industries, 
and easing the "bottlenecks" in economic development in order to 
better the foreign investment climate. The Chinese Government 
has decided to abolish over 2,700 development zones, which means 
that we will still have about 500 national- and provincial-level 
development zones, still too many. The number should be further 
scaled back so that whatever funds available can be concentrated 
on and put to better use in developing a number of key 
development zones, thus making the investment pay off sooner. A 
few days ago the Chinese Government approved 54 new major 
large-scale projects in the "bottleneck" industries. They will 
be a big boost to the economy. 
<H5>  Speed Up Lawmaking for Market Economy </H5>
  As local experts see it, the market economy is an economy of 
laws based on highly competitive commodity production and 
commodity exchange. Inevitably it is accompanied by 
haphazardness, social injustice, and other maladies. Even more 
so than the planned economy, therefore, the market economy needs 
to be guided, regularized, safeguarded, and disciplined by a 
sound legal system. The Hong Kong economy is a well-developed 
market economy as well as an economy solidly based on laws, the 
product of a lengthy and gradual development process. In this 
sense Hong Kong offers a model that China can emulate as it 
develops a market economy. 
  Some Hong Kong scholars take pains to point out that a 
market 
economy is no panacea. It is wrong to make a fetish of the 
planned economy, of course, but it is just as wrong to have 
blind faith in the market economy. The emphasis by the 3d 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on the 
accelerated development of a legal system is both necessary and 
timely from the perspective of building a socialist market 
economy vigorously but cautiously.

<F P=106> [Report written by Li Kuo-chiang (2621 0948 1730) on 9 </F>
November 1993 in Xian, Shaanxi, interview at the State Council 
Information Office at the Olympic Games Village in Beijing on 8 
November 1993 with State Council Information Office Director 
Zeng Jianhui (2582 1696 1798): "Help the World Understand China 
-- Interview With PRC State Council Information Office Director 
Zeng Jianhui"] 
  [Text] China has entered an age of rapid growth. 
  China's every action and movement is increasingly becoming 
the focus of worldwide attention. 
  So to "help China understand the world, and the world to 
better comprehend China," a new department emerged in China 
three years ago, that is, the State Council Information 
Office--an agency to assist all major State Council departments 
in speaking for the State Council. 
<H5>  Zeng Jianhui: China's External Propaganda Official </H5>
  Hong Kong and foreign reporters conducting interviews in 
mainland China have to maintain frequent contacts with this 
office. 
  In media fields such as press, publication, film, TV, and 
broadcasting, increasing numbers of figures from outside of 
China's borders wish to cooperate with the relevant parties in 
China. They of course know that the State Council has an 
Information Office that is in charge of China's external 
propaganda. 
  The Information Office's director is Zeng Jianhui, who is 
also a deputy director of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda 
Department and director of the Central External Propaganda 
Office, so is in charge of China's external propaganda policy. 
  Early on the morning of 8 November 1993, the city of Beijing 
seemed particularly warm and bright. At 0830, I arrived by car 
at the State Council Information Office in the Asian Games 
Village to interview Director Zeng Jianhui. 
  The radiant but simply attired Zeng Jianhui was somewhat 
alike in features and build to the well-known Hong Kong scholar 
and Hong Kong affairs advisor Liu Chao-chia [0491 0340 0163], 
with his presentation of views and style of conversation also 
similarly well-considered and methodical. He had had very little 
previous exposure, and for a figure as important as he, it was 
understood that this was also the first time that his life 
experiences were being disclosed in such detail to the outside 
world. 
<H5>  Information Office Is Set Up After the "4 June Disturbance" </H5>
  The Information Office was established as the State Council 
news department after the 1989 "4 June disturbance." 
  The State Council Information Office was founded in early 
1990, with its first director being Zhu Muzhi [2612 4476 0037], 
who retired in March 1993, to be succeeded as Information Office 
director by Zeng Jianhui. 
  China's reform, opening up, and national conditions were in 
great need of understanding by the outside world. To speed up 
China's development, it was necessary to help "China understand 
the world, and the world to better comprehend China." In light 
of the comparative backwardness and slowness of China's external 
media means, the control by the West of the contemporary world's 
crucial mass media, and the experience of the "4 June" incident, 
China had become even more aware of the urgency of providing 
accurate and rapid news to help the world understand China. 
While it had taken certain previous actions in this area, it had 
no department in special charge, and no single agency to 
coordinate all government departments. So it set up the State 
Council Information Office in early 1990 as a comprehensive 
administrative body and news department to objectively brief the 
outside world on China's key policy decisions. 
  Zeng Jianhui disclosed that the State Council Information 
Office in Beijing had less than 100 employees, for a 
well-streamlined staff. 
  Zeng Jianhui's two assistants, deputy directors Yang 
Zhengquan [2799 2973 3123] and Li Yuanchao [2621 3293 3390], 
were both very competent and qualified. 
<H3>  Information Office Put in Charge of State Council Press 
Statements in 1993 </H3>
  What key tasks is the Information Office charged with? Zeng 
Jianhui said that they are: 
  1. To coordinate and expedite government-sector briefings of 
China's conditions to the public and the world, particularly 
China's advances in reform and opening up focused on the 
economy. As overseas and foreign figures are coming to China 
to gather news in increasing numbers, it is necessary to have an 
agency like the Information Office take charge of all aspects of 
coordination. All State Council departments have now installed 
press spokesmen, who are working in very active coordination to 
further overseas understanding of China and pave the media way 
for reform and opening up. Zeng Jianhui disclosed that beginning 
in 1993, the Information Office has been responsible for State 
Council press statements. 
<H3>  Information Office Holds Two Press Conferences a Month, 
Inviting Departmental Officials To Respond to Reporters' 
Questions </H3>
  The work of the many State Council departments is varied and 
complex, making it hard to fully understand and promptly report 
on the conditions of all departments. Zeng Jianhui said that the 
State Council Information Office holds two press conferences a 
month, inviting one State Council department director each time 
to respond to questions of public concern. We have held 17 such 
press conferences, which have been attended by figures such as 
Li Lanqing (former MOFERT Minister and now State Council Vice 
Premier), Peng Peiyun (currently State Councilor and Minister in 
Charge of the State Family Planning Commission), Wang Zhongyu 
(director of the State Economics and Trade Commission), Tao Siju 
(Minister of Public Security), and Xiao Yang (Minister of 
Justice), who have responded at these press conferences to 
questions put by reporters from various countries. This enables 
all departments to serve as their own spokesmen to give all a 
deeper understanding of each department. 
<H5>  Information Office Sets Up a Journalist Liaison Room </H5>
  2. To take questions from reporters, the Information Office 
has a Journalist Liaison Room, with Information Office Deputy 
Director Zhao Shaohua (f) [6392 1421 5478] in charge, to serve 
foreign, Hong Kong Macaoan, and Taiwanese reporters. Reporters 
can present any questions to this Liaison Room, which will help 
to answer them. 
  In helping reporters to get interviews, what is the 
difference between the Information Office and the All-China 
Journalists Association? Zeng Jianhui said that: The All-China 
Journalists Association is a mass organization, which can help 
reporters by furnishing information and solving certain 
practical problems; but for authoritative news within China, it 
is necessary to go through the Information Office; for 
interviews in other parts of the country, the Information Office 
can provide reporters better interview conditions. 
  In the last few years, under State Council leadership, the 
Information Office has published "white papers" on matters such 
as human rights, Tibet, and Taiwan to help foreigners understand 
the truth. All of these "white papers" have been followed with 
interest by all countries. 
<H3>  "News Coverage in China Not Increasingly Difficult, But 
Rather Ever Easier" </H3>
  Since the "Hsi Yang incident" of Hong Kong's MING PAO, it 
has 
been asked: Will news coverage in China be increasingly 
difficult, with ever more blockages? Zeng Jianhui stated clearly 
that news coverage in China will be not increasingly difficult, 
but rather ever easier. As long as news coverage is normal and 
within legal limits, China's enormous changes and all news and 
events will be sources that overseas reporters can cover to 
their heart's content. The Information Office is going to show 
more initiative in providing the outside world with information 
on China's crucial matters, by reinforcing contacts with 
overseas press circles. 
  As Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 
nears, exchanges between Hong Kong and the interior should 
become closer. Zeng Jianhui said that Hong Kong reporters are 
welcome to make more contacts with the Information Office. In 
1994, the Information Office is likely to organize a news 
coverage of Bohai Wan (bay) and the great northwest, which will 
last about one week, and in which Hong Kong reporters are 
invited to take part. 
<H5>  A Well-Supported News Specialist </H5>
  Zeng Jianhui is a well-supported cadre. 
  A senior correspondent told me: "Zeng Jianhui is a genial 
person who does painstaking work. Despite his important 
position, he has no air of a high official, both keeping contact 
with the public, while having rich practical experience, so that 
he is truly a lifelong news specialist." 
<H5>  Zeng Jiahui Is Born in Changsha, Hunan in December 1928 </H5>
  While Zeng Jianhui was born on 1 December 1928 in Changsha, 
Hunan, his ancestral home was in Pingjiang County, Hunan. 
Pingjiang is located in eastern Hunan, being a mountainous area 
where CPC guerrilla forces were active at the time. Five 
months after his birth, on 22 July 1928, it was there that Peng 
Dehuai led the famous "Pingjiang uprising," and at the end of 
the year led his troops into the Jinggang Mountains. 
  The War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945) broke out on 
a full scale in 1937, with the flames of war spreading before 
long to the banks of the Xiangjiang River in Hunan. Zeng Jianhui 
was studying at the time in Hunan at the Mingde High School, 
which was moved in 1944 to Xiaolan'gang in rural Hengshan 
County. When the Japanese army invaded and occupied Hengshan 
in May 1944, 16-year-old Zeng Jianhui, who had just finished 
10th grade, fled to Chenxi County in western Hunan. As Hunan 
University's temporary campus was there at the time, Zeng 
Jianhui attended there for a year with his older classmates, 
studying independently to complete his high school courses. 
<H3>  Zeng Jianhui Takes Part in "1 December" Student Movement in 
Kunming, Passes Entrance Exam to Qinghua University's Department 
of Electrical Engineering </H3>
  In July 1945, Zeng Jianhui arrived in Kunming, Yunnan, by 
which time the examination period for Southwest Joint University 
(formed during the war of Beijing University, Qinghua 
University, and Nankai University) was over. After the War of 
Resistance Against Japan ended in victory on 15 August 1945, 
Zeng Jianhui passed the entrance exam to the last college 
preparatory class at Southwest Joint University. After he had 
completed this course, Southwest Joint University closed down, 
with the 1946 demobilization in Kunming bringing the restoration 
of Beijing, Qinghua, and Nankai universities. At that time, Zeng 
Jianhui was promoted to the Department of Electrical Engineering 
at Qinghua University. 
  Due to his dissatisfaction with the KMT's corrupt rule and 
zeal for civil war, Zeng Jianhui, like many of his classmates of 
the time, threw himself into the Kunming student movement, 
taking part in the "1 December" student movement that began on 1 
December 1945 in Kunming. As he was not yet a member of the CPC 
at the age of 17, he threw himself into the student movement 
only out of a sense of youthful justice. He opposed the KMT 
military and police siege of the campus, and its massacre and 
beating of striking anti-civil war professors and students. He 
attended with his classmates an anti-civil war public lecture on 
the Southwest Joint University campus in the western Kunming 
suburbs, where the KMT military police actually fired warning 
shots. Who would have guessed that the following day's KMT press 
would say that "last night's gunfire came from bandits in the 
western suburbs," turning all professors and students into a 
gang of bandits. This further aroused the students' righteous 
indignation, to the point where they announced a boycott of 
classes. When the KMT sent spies to break this student strike, 
sending armed police who beat students and actually threw hand 
grenades that killed four of them, Southwest Joint University 
students took the lead in launching the mammoth and famous "1 
December" student movement among all Kunming schools, in which 
Zeng Jianhui was an active participant. 
  When the war ended in victory, Zeng Jianhui moved with the 
Kunming demobilization to Qinghua University in Peking, studying 
in its Department of Electrical Engineering, where his 
classmates included people such as now PRC Minister of Radio, 
Cinema, and Television Ai Zhisheng. 
  The KMT at the time was zealously fighting a civil war, 
bringing civilians extreme misery and unspeakable suffering. 
Peking students were against starvation and civil war, 
staging marches and demonstrations like a raging fire, in each 
of which Zeng Jianhui took an active part. This gave him more 
opportunities to ponder the status quo of the society, from 
which considerations he searched out a new path and took action 
in response. 
  In 1948, Zeng Jianhui finally joined the CPC underground 
party, at which time he was the editor of the Peking semimonthly 
ZHONGJIAN sponsored by progressive professors at Beijing and 
Qinghua universities. 
<H3>  Zeng Jianhui Begins General Information Office Work, in 
Charge of External Propaganda </H3>
  Peking was peacefully liberated at the end of 1948. As 
broadcasting personnel were treated very well at the time, and 
the newly established New China Broadcast Station (the 
predecessor of the Central People's Broadcast Station) needed 
someone who knew English, it chose Zeng Jianhui, who was fluent 
in English, as an assistant editor of its English broadcast 
section, which responsible department was also the predecessor 
of the New China News Agency's Foreign Affairs Department. In 
the more than four decades since, Zeng Jianhui has always been 
in charge of external propaganda, taking part in foreign affairs 
work. 
  After the founding of the PRC in October 1949, PRC officials 
paid great attention to press work, setting up the General 
Information Office. The General Information Office was under the 
charge of Hu Qiaomu [5170 0829 2606], under which was the 
International Press Bureau, whose director was Qiao Guanhua 
[0829 0385 5478], with the New China Broadcast Station's English 
broadcast department being subordinate to this bureau, to become 
the International Press Bureau's news agency, which was 
specially charged with the New China News Agency's external news 
releases. Zeng Jianhui was an assistant editor at the news 
agency of the General Information Office's International Press 
bureau. 
  In 1951, the General Information Office was dismantled, with 
Zeng Jianhui being reassigned to the New China News Agency's 
Foreign Affairs Department, starting as a secretary and moving 
up to editor and correspondent, with his work being to write the 
English texts of external broadcasts. 
  In 1952, during the Korean War ceasefire negotiations, Zeng 
Jianhui was ordered to lead a group of correspondents to North 
Korea to report on prisoner repatriation, where he wrote his 
famous news dispatch entitled "POWs Did Not die on the March." 
  From the mid-1950s to the 1966 Cultural Revolution, he was 
one of the few New China News Agency's political foreign affairs 
correspondents allowed to cover the news within Zhongnanhai. He 
was already very well known in press circles, having been 
promoted to director of the New China News Agency's Foreign 
Affairs Correspondents Group. 
  During the Cultural Revolution, he was put out of the way 
for 
a time, allowed to do only in-office translation work, while 
also spending a few months at a cadre school in Fangshan County. 
As English writing and news coverage talent was needed at the 
time, and he had outstanding competence in this field, he was 
reassigned during the latter part of the Cultural Revolution to 
the New China News Agency's General Editorial Room as an 
assistant editor-in-chief, taking part many times in covering 
the news of meetings by Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with foreign 
heads of state and important guests. 
<H3>  Zeng Jianhui Twice Leads Delegations To Cover Major 
International Sports Competitions </H3>
  Zeng Jianhui has also led delegations twice to cover major 
international sporting events. 
  In 1978, when he was assistant editor-in-chief at the New 
China News Agency, Zeng Jianhui led a large delegation of 
Chinese correspondents to Thailand to cover the Bangkok Asian 
Games. 
  In 1984, when the Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles, 
Zeng Jianhui also led a delegation of Chinese correspondents to 
cover them, by which time he was a deputy director of the New 
China News Agency. 
<H3>  Zeng Jianhi Promoted to Deputy Director of Central 
Propaganda Department in 1988 </H3>
  In May 1982, Zeng Jianhui was promoted to deputy director of 
the New China News Agency, in charge of external propaganda and 
particular editorial room work. Then in 1988 he was promoted 
to deputy director of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda 
Department, while still serving concurrently as deputy director 
of the New China News Agency. By 1992, as he had too many 
affairs to manage, he finally left his post at the New China 
News Agency. 
<H3>  Zeng Jianhui Takes Over as Information Office Director in 
March 1993 </H3>
  Zeng Jianhui's current key post is director of the State 
Council Information Office, which is not only a key post at the 
ministerial level, but also can be called the PRC State 
Council's mouthpiece.

<F P=106> [Article by Xiang Xuhan (0686 4872 3352) and Peng Jiaming </F>
(1756 1367 2494): "Influence of Party and Government-Run 
Economic Entities on the Judicial System, Legal Countermeasures"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 1. Entities and units 
set up and operated by the party are unable to cut their ties; 
there is no differentiation between government and enterprise, 
or between official and commercial; and it is hard to tell the 
defendants from the plaintiffs. 
  To provide support to entities being run by party and 
governmental organs, the great majority of local party 
committees and governments have explicit regulations: Concerning 
entities which temporarily do not have the wherewithal to cut 
ties, they are permitted a transitional period, and after 
conditions are ripe then all relations are to be severed. 
Undoubtedly this sort of regulation has a certain positive 
effect in the initial phase when the entity is being created. 
However, because the entity's structure and its personnel and 
even its property have not yet been cut loose from the party or 
government organ, the interests of the entity are still closely 
linked with the interests of the cadre, thus it is hardly 
avoidable that some units make use of these functional 
advantages to get someone's initials on something, uncover 
resources of materials, make hot merchandise scarce. The party 
and government organs in Tianjin city set up some 124 entities, 
of which only seven cut their ties. According to an 
investigation, despite the fact that when these entities were 
set up they were duly registered with the industrial and 
commercial control departments and attained the status of legal 
persons, looking at them at the present time from the angle of 
their actual control structures, they fall into only two types. 
In one type the party or government organ used the "washed 
hands" method and contracted it out to an individual, and while 
the parent organ provides some facilitating for it, it also 
rakes in a certain amount of management fees; the other type is 
that in which the parent organ sets up a "big contract and tight 
connections" and everything is centrally controlled and 
operated. Because the entity and the parent organ are unable to 
cut their ties, there remains a huge spider-web of relationships 
between the two, and no matter which of the above two types of 
operation was chosen, it has to result in the situation wherein 
there is no differentiation between government and enterprise, 
between official and commercial. But this is exactly the reverse 
of the goal of the reforms, and this is especially true in the 
cases where official and commercial are not separated and 
authority is used to make the commerce operate: Exactly what the 
masses of people most detest. In the same manner, when 
government is tied to business, it presents some new problems to 
the People's Courts in their judicial work. At present the most 
prominent problems occur when an organ's entity has a dispute 
with an individual: What position in the litigation does the 
party or governmental organ take? When asked this, judicial 
officers commonly hold one of three opinions. 1) The 
party/governmental organ cannot become a party in the 
litigation, the reason being that, in theory, the entity is an 
independent legal person and should independently shoulder its 
legal responsibilities. 2) The party/governmental organ has the 
position of plaintiff or defendant in the litigation, the reason 
being that in reality, the entity's status as a legal person is 
nominal not actual, the organ is really the person running the 
operation. 3) The party/governmental organ is a third party 
without independent rights of appeal, the reason being that the 
entity is an independent legal person, but the outcome of the 
decision on the case has relevance to the entity's interests 
under the law. We believe that all three of the above views 
suffer from bias, and cannot categorically address the question 
of the position of party and governmental organs in litigation 
cases; we should do a synthesis of cases and seek a firm 
understanding from the actual situations. 
  2. When economic management departments and 
governmental and judicial organs engage in commercial 
businesses, it causes problems among the masses and judicial 
work becomes difficult. 
  The majority of the entities established by party and 
government organs are established utilizing the organ's own 
functional advantages, and thus the interests of the entity and 
those of the organ and its cadres are intimately connected. Some 
units unavoidably make use of their own official authority to 
market their power or monopolize a sector. This is especially 
true of some economic control departments with real power and 
governmental and judicial organs which engage in commercial 
businesses. Even though nominally the entities they establish 
are market principals equal with other companies and 
enterprises, because of the effects of the functions and 
official power of their parent organs, they seem to be most able 
to control the markets and master all situations. This is a 
matter of concern with the populace, who consider this a type of 
"upside down officialdom" and "official businessmen," and 
universally complain that "the powerful make lots of money, the 
not so powerful make a little money, the powerless don't make 
any money at all." In the same manner, the involvement of these 
organs has had a rather great effect upon litigation work in the 
judiciary. Considering present conditions, the establishment of 
commercial entities by such units and organs has had the 
following effects upon the judiciary. 1) Economic control 
departments which in their own right have state apportioned 
management authority can, in some areas, directly influence and 
exert pressure upon the judicial organs. The result is that when 
the judicial organs are handling cases which directly affect the 
entities established by the these units or departments, it has 
no choice but to act with extreme caution. 2) When handling 
cases involving the entities set up by other governmental or 
judicial departments, the judiciary often is subjected to the 
influence of personal intercessions and relationships. 3) In 
cases where the odd judicial organ has established its own 
economic entity, some judiciary personnel have become involved 
in "running the business," the image of the judiciary and the 
judicial official is greatly effected, especially when handling 
cases of litigation involving the very entity it has established. 
  3. Registered capital is falsified, real entities 
become "ghost entities," judicial decisions and rulings are 
difficult to enforce. 
  Even though according to the materials provided by the 
industrial and commercial departments the 124 entities of organs 
have registered capital of over 18 million yuan, according to 
actual figures which we have, the majority of the units' 
registered capital is exaggerated. Some of the figures are 
totally fabricated out of nothing, others reflect borrowing from 
someone in order to register and then immediately repaying them; 
some exaggerate by increasing the value of mortgaged goods. Our 
investigation shows that majority of the capital in the organs' 
entities comes from three areas. First are bank loans and loans 
from friends and relatives. Second are public funds invested by 
the organ establishing the entity, and third are from personal 
savings. However, these funds are always limited, short term, 
and unstable. In Tianjin personal savings amount to 1.2 million 
yuan, and the average for each entity is less than 10,000 yuan. 
Many of the bank loans taken out by the entities have fallen 
due; public funds invested by the establishing organ cannot be 
subjected to any risks and can be recalled at any time, so many 
of the organs' entities only have their license and their 
personnel but have no "wherewithal" to run a business, thus 
becoming "ghost entities." Thus, in the administration of 
justice, after a case is settled, we often encounter the 
situation where these units have no capacity for continued 
operation; the judicial decision or ruling is nothing more than 
"empty words" and "useless sentences." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Wei Jingsheng (7614 0079 3932): "Savior or </F>
Malefactor? On the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Mao Zedong"] 
  [Text] This subject is a very large one, but we don't have 
to go into it at great length. At first glance, it seems that we 
are talking about the achievements and faults of Mao Zedong, but 
actually we are discussing our predicament as Chinese people, 
and the causes. To use the oft-repeated formula, currently 
popular among the masses on the mainland, we can speak of "the 
inveterate evil-mindedness" and the "vileness" of the Chinese. 
  For the last hundred years, or since even more remote times, 
our several hundreds of millions of fellow countrymen definitely 
have been living in hellish misery. Not only has food and 
clothing been a problem, but even minimal human rights could not 
be guaranteed. To describe it in colloquial language, "the rich 
and powerful didn't treat us poor folks like human beings"; but, 
in fact, were the rich and powerful treated like human beings? 
They themselves had no such expectation, so slavish formulas 
like "I wish to labor like a dog or a horse" were fashionable 
politenesses, and remained in common use for a long time. In a 
country as large as China, were there no men? 
  There is more. Starting two thousand years ago, with the 
first time that a totalitarian and despotic dynasty was 
overthrown, wise men have continually appeared in China, and 
sounded the clarion call of human rights. Their slogans and 
ideals were of various kinds, but they had one thing in common, 
and that was the demand that farmers and convicts, who were at 
the lowest strata of society, be treated as equals. "Are there 
any noblemen, or generals or great officials, who are worth 
anything?" The problem of food and clothing was of secondary 
importance. They were not things to be received as a matter of 
course; they had to be won through the effort of each 
individual. Only under the system of slavery, under feudalism, 
did people receive food and clothing, or get treated like human 
beings, as a matter of course. But people are not ordinary 
animals. What they demand first is to be treated like human 
beings, by others, and by themselves. To use the expression that 
is in vogue right now, they demand, first of all, that their 
human rights be guaranteed, not that they be treated merely as 
"domestic animals that can talk" or as "tame implements" to be 
cared for and ordered about. 
  Therefore, it was only the clarion calls of the wise and 
brave men of successive ages that enabled the people to unite in 
vast numbers and achieve great things. Mao Zedong and his 
comrades (or at least a considerable portion of them) were wise 
and brave men of just this kind. Their slogans combined many 
foreign ideals and were the most alluring promises in history. 
How could the people, so crushed under the weight of suffering 
that they could not draw a breath, and muddled into bewilderment 
for generations by their rules, not revere him as a living 
bodhisattva? This is why a great savior comes to be; not because 
he does good things for the people, but because the people 
impatiently expected him to do good things for them. Placing 
hopes in a great savior is an ignorant fantasy, but still it 
cannot be called "the inveterate evil-mindedness" of a 
"villain." Everyone has the right to struggle for, and then to 
achieve, a happy life. This is also a fundamental human right. 
  If there is any "vileness," then it lies in the pervasive 
conditioning, of several thousand years of despotic culture, and 
in the psychological tendency of small producers toward 
narrowness and short-sighted greed, which makes them content to 
accept, and be satisfied with, a "great savior." They do not 
want to think about "different political views" anymore, nor do 
they want to apply themselves anymore, to thought or action; 
they don't want to take risks, and think "cunningly" that, after 
nature has grown the fruit for them, they can then sit idle and 
enjoy the harvest. Therefore, they instinctively assist the 
"great savior" to seize power, and consolidate his dictatorial, 
despotic regime; in reality, they are solely responsible for 
building the despotic regime that oppresses and exploits them. 
The so-called "new authoritarianism" and "old Fascism," are 
nothing more than a modern version of small farmer ideology. 
  Not only Mao Zedong, but all the great saviors of successive 
dynasties and eras, naturally acted out the ugly side of human 
nature in full measure, as soon as they were raised to be 
dictators. Selfishness, greed, cruelty -- these evils of human 
nature, that show up even in children, but are restrained by the 
social environment, reach almost their extreme limit in every 
dictator. This is because dictators are not subject to the 
restraint of the social environment, and possess omnipotent 
power offered up to them by the people in their delusion. It is 
just like plants and animals, that, once freed of environmental 
constraints, will multiply to the extreme, leading to an 
ecological disturbance. Once the social ecology is disturbed 
this will lead to an extreme expansion of government power and a 
pernicious growth in bureaucratism. Therefore, once the attempt 
is made to realize in practice, in society, the blessings of 
despotism under "great saviors and just rulers," as fantasized 
in small-farmer socialism, then small farmers themselves will 
become its greatest victims, and it will also bring disaster to 
all other strata of society. 
  Small farmers and small producers (including 
"intellectuals"), are of all groups the most powerless to 
protect their members in society. All they can do, in the face 
of heavy oppression, is to beg the oppressors to take pity on 
them, or else, in addition to that, to betray others who are 
also oppressed, in return for "rights" under an ever-worsening 
state of life. Moreover, from this is produced a "vileness with 
Chinese characteristics:" They give their most revolting 
flattery to those who oppress and exploit them most fiercely, 
but they break the head of anyone who is brave enough to come 
forward on their behalf, and cry out against the wrongs done to 
them. In this way, they ingratiate themselves with those who are 
sucking their blood. This curious and outlandish trait of their 
character came out, in its most typical form, and most plainly, 
during the Mao Zedong era, and especially during the Cultural 
Revolution. This is the greatest tragedy of a great people, and 
it is also a tragedy for the dictators themselves. If the 
people, in their delusion, had not raised them up to be gods, 
would they not have become better people? The life of Mao Zedong 
is a tragedy of this kind, that will make a person wring his 
hands and sigh. 
  Nowadays, some people are nostalgic about Mao Zedong. 
Actually, they are nostalgic for the honest government of that 
time (which at least proves that Mao sincerely tried to be a 
good person). They absolutely are not nostalgic for the excesses 
and poverty of that time, and still less do they "ardently love 
despotic socialism." When some people in official positions 
seize on this subject, to put over their own ideas, it means 
they have an ulterior motive. Don't they envy that god-like, 
absolute power? At least, it gave quicker results than the "new 
authoritarianism." It is not impossible that they might take 
advantage of the prevailing climate to launch a new deification 
movement. But, regrettably, history does not retrace its steps, 
and circumstances change as time goes by. A new deification 
movement might end in a farce, and the gods might turn into 
buffoons. Let us wait and see.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Keying (3769 0344 5391): "Energetically </F>
Develop the Rural Insurance Industry; Promote the Stable Growth 
in Agricultural Production"] 
  [Text] Our province is subject to recurrent natural 
disasters. In 1993 we first had freezing cold and then hail 
damage and tornadoes, and with summer came disastrous floods 
which caused major losses in agricultural production, personal 
property and state property. Direct economic losses attributable 
to these disasters amounted to more than 10 billion yuan for the 
whole province. When the disasters happened, the people of the 
whole province, under the leadership of the party committees and 
government at all levels fought the disasters courageously to 
rebuild their homes; the insurance departments played a major 
role in these activities. Up to the present date, the provincial 
insurance system has paid out over 150 million yuan in insurance 
claims to over 6,300 afflicted enterprises in the disaster 
areas, to over 120,000 households which suffered damage and for 
over 4.3 million mu of damaged cropland. A great many damaged 
enterprises were able to resume normal production and operations 
very quickly, and the suffering people were able to stabilize 
their lives in short order. Various types of post-disaster 
self-help activities were able to be carried out swiftly after 
the calamity. The experience in fighting and recovering from 
these disasters showed the leadership at all levels and each 
comrade working in the rural villages that in the countryside, 
if we want to effectively organize the farmers to fight and 
recover from disasters, one of the major aspects that must be 
attended to is the forceful expansion of the insurance sector. 
Hunan is a major agricultural province, and is one in which 
natural disasters frequently occur. That we must make major 
efforts to organize the farmers to prevent and recover from 
disasters is commonly recognized by every level of leadership. 
However, that insurance is a major link to be forged in this 
major undertaking is something that some of our comrades do not 
easily comprehend. From this we can see that in order to effect 
a great expansion of rural insurance, the first task is for all 
levels of leadership to have a correct understanding of 
insurance, and a common understanding which includes grasping at 
least three points of truth and fable. 
  1. Expansion of insurance will not hamper production, but 
can 
only greatly promote production. 
  A necessary condition for guaranteeing the smooth operation 
of production and the expansion of reproduction is the 
establishment of a reserve insurance fund to be used to make up 
the economic losses incurred from natural disasters and 
unexpected accidents. This will not only not hinder production, 
but on the contrary, can only strengthen and promote production. 
This is especially true in agricultural production where natural 
calamities abound and to a great extent, one "depends upon 
nature for food." The situation in our province last year amid 
the major calamities completely substantiated this point. In 
July, in Hangongdu Village, Tingcheng District of Changde City, 
more than 20,000 mu of cotton was inundated, more than 5,000 mu 
was flattened and died. Because they had insurance, the People's 
Insurance Company paid over 950,000 yuan in compensation. The 
affected cotton farmers used the advance compensation to quickly 
purchase materials for resuming production, and used the 
opportunity to convert the cotton fields to rice paddies and 
planted over 4000 mu of rice. However, in some places insurance 
is not handled well, and after a disaster even resuming normal 
living is extremely difficult, much less is there a quick 
recovery in production. 
  2. Insurance is not an added burden for the farmers, but can 
only lessen their load. 
  Insurance is an economic compensation system, concretely 
embodied in the form of a reciprocal economic contract. The 
farmers take on the responsibility of paying insurance fees, and 
then have the right to receive insurance compensation from the 
insurance company in times of disaster. This sort of reciprocal 
right and responsibility relationship is of course not the same 
as the unfettered apportioning of expenses or exacting fees. A 
bit of honest social enquiry will show that at the present, the 
farmers' heaviest and most feared burdens are disaster without 
relief, aging without caretakers, and sickness without medical 
aid. When the farmers join the insurance system and pay the 
small insurance fee, then when a calamity happens or the 
insurance comes to full term, they can receive the corresponding 
economic compensation or insurance payoff, and achieve their 
goals of having compensation for disaster, care in old age and 
medical care when ill. Thus, the fear of trouble dogging their 
steps is eliminated and their ability to withstand risks is 
enhanced. How can this do anything other than relieve the 
farmers' burdens? 
  3. Insurance is not a governmental burden, but lessens its 
worries and solves its problems. 
  When the populace meets with disasters and production 
encounters difficulties, all levels of government must as a 
matter of course fulfill their duties and responsibilities to 
relieve the troubles of the people. However, the losses caused 
by disasters are not problems which can be solved by relying 
solely upon the limited relief funds of the government, and the 
relief aid of other social departments is also extremely 
limited. The positively effective method is to rely upon 
insurance to mitigate the dangers, to organize a thousand 
households to come to the aid of one. During the recent 
disasters, the county magistrates in the areas where insurance 
matters were well handled happily said: "When we saw the 
insurance agents appear we gained peace of mind." "In the 
disasters this year, with insurance as our backup, it was a lot 
easier to be a county (village) magistrate." From this we can 
see that insurance does not make trouble for the government, but 
lessens the worries and solves the problems of our leaders at 
all levels. Insurance benefits the farmers in many ways. 
Logically speaking, every level of leadership should give full 
support to insurance. However, this is not the way it works out 
in real life. Some comrades talk about the importance of 
insurance, but if you expect them to really give support and 
aid, they are unwilling and ineffectual; in an informal setting 
they will talk about the importance of insurance, but in the 
formal setting with the masses they are not so bold or assured 
on insurance matters. There are several problems with the line 
between truth and falsehood which must be clarified if we expect 
all levels of leadership to put their back into supporting the 
expansion of the insurance sector. 
  First, we must make a clear distinction between 
organizational mobilization and administrative interference, and 
boldly solve the difficulties involved in expanding the 
insurance sector. At present, we have a great many comrades who 
are not at all clear about what sort of role the various levels 
of government and the various levels of leadership should play 
in economic construction under the market economy. They 
onesidedly think that in running a market economy, neither the 
leaders nor the governmental departments can be of much help as 
far as economic work is concerned. They can think of nothing to 
say and can find no place to play a useful role. Thus, when the 
insurance departments mention some concrete problems and 
questions which require their help in solving, they are always 
unavailable and evasive, fearing that giving support to 
insurance work means using administrative measures to interfere 
with economic work. This sort of mindset is extremely harmful. 
Insurance is a social action. We want all levels of leadership 
to support the development of rural insurance so as to draw 
support from administrative influence and to initiate an 
effective organization and mobilization throughout society. For 
instance, focusing on the problem of the weak understanding of 
rural insurance, the various levels of leadership and 
governmental departments can and indeed should, through 
effective channels and forms, initiate a widespread propaganda 
and mobilization effort directed at the farmers to enhance their 
understanding of the risks involved and so voluntarily join the 
insurance program. Done in this way, there is nothing they can 
be reproached for. There is a fundamental difference between 
this sort of work and the type of administrative interference 
which forces the farmers to do this or not do that without 
regard to objective conditions. For this reason, we want to make 
the organization and mobilization of the farmer to voluntarily 
elect to take insurance and the resolution of various problems 
in the expansion of the rural insurance sector a real part of 
the work of all levels of leadership and governmental 
departments, and have them do this work boldly and assuredly. 
  Secondly, we must clearly differentiate between voluntary 
uniform election of insurance and forced participation in 
insurance, and boldly expand the happy circumstance of the broad 
masses of farmers gladly accepting the expansion of rural 
insurance. Some time ago the insurance company did some useful 
exploration of the ways to organize the farmers to get 
insurance. For instance, to focus on the fact that farmers' 
housing is widely dispersed in many locations over a wide area, 
the implementation of uniform insurance registration on a 
voluntary basis, one could say, has a positive effect on the 
rural insurance industry, and is a useful way to adapt to 
present conditions in rural villages and expand rural insurance. 
However, some people latched on to the fault that some of the 
work done in the process of organizing was rather haphazard, 
found grievous fault with this method, calling it forced 
insuring: This is not fair. Looking at the actual situation in 
our province's rural villages at the present moment, it would 
seem a reasonable request to ask the insurance company to send a 
person to knock on every door and collect insurance fees. 
However, looking at the actual situation in the province, it 
would be extremely difficult to actually do this and in some 
places one can say that it is impossible to do. Even if it could 
be done, it would greatly increase to the operational costs of 
rural insurance and would adversely affect the accumulation of 
risk funds. For this reason, on the basis of an all-round 
propaganda mobilization and the voluntary participation of the 
farmers, the insurance company, through its agents, conducted 
uniform insurance election procedures. It is a necessary and 
feasible method which cannot be simply labeled "total insurance" 
meaning that it was forced insurance. At present, following 
changes in governmental functions, the forms of governmental 
support of insurance have seen corresponding changes, going from 
direct involvement to indirect propaganda and guidance. For this 
reason, we must be based on reality, and boldly expand the 
beneficial situation in which the broad masses of farmers 
willingly join in, taking the new path of a combination of 
direct acceptance of insurance and the use of agents, and 
pushing rural insurance work to ever higher levels. 
  Thirdly, we must make clear the relations between the 
Peoples' Insurance Company and other insurance organizations, 
and actively support the Peoples' Insurance Company's role as 
the main channel of insurance. With the continued flourishing of 
the socialist market economy, it is necessary that many more 
insurance entities be fostered. However the unique aspect of 
rural insurance is that the agricultural products production 
process is greatly affected by the natural elements and the 
rural households operate over a widespread area, so that once a 
calamity hits, not only are the losses tremendous, the survey of 
the damage done and calculation of compensation also requires a 
tremendous amount of men and materiel. This makes it necessary 
for the organization providing rural insurance to have not only 
great power, but to have a vast staff of personnel and a 
tremendous insurance network. Considering the several insurance 
organizations which are expanding the insurance business in our 
province at present, the China Peoples' Insurance Company is the 
one which can satisfy the requirements of the broad masses of 
the farmers. All levels of the party and government should 
actively support the China People's Insurance Company's in 
carrying out its work in the rural villages and playing the role 
of main insurance channel. As far as those insurance 
organizations which as yet are unable to provide insurance 
service to the villages, all levels of the government and the 
financial control departments should follow governmental 
policies and regulations, actively aid in creating appropriate 
circumstances, while at the same time strengthening control and 
discipline, so as to unfalteringly protect the personal 
interests of the broad masses of farmers.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Hongru (0491 7703 0320): "Chinese Securities </F>
Markets on the Way To Standardization"] 
  [Text] The founding of China's securities markets was 
marked by the issuance of state treasury bonds in 1981. After 
more than a decade, and with their rapid development in the last 
two years in particular, they are beginning to take shape and 
are flourishing and prospering. They have become one of the hot 
points in our economic life. 
<H5>  The Four Stages of Development of China's Securities Markets </H5>
  The first stage was the beginning stage during the years 
1981-1988. At first, they still bore the marks of the planned 
economy and were haphazard government bond markets. Even though 
some 45.5 billion yuan's worth of bonds were issued during that 
period, because they were distributed under the method of 
government-assigned purchases and were not transferrable, nor 
could they be circulated, there was never a secondary market for 
government bonds in the standard sense. It was during this 
period that enterprise bonds, financial bonds, and stocks began 
to appear. In regions where reform had begun first, especially, 
not only were fairly standardized forms of stocks issued to the 
public -- for example, Shanghai's Vacuum Electronic Apparatus 
Co. Ltd. and Feiyue Shareholding Co. Ltd. stocks, Shenyang's 
Jinbei Automobile Co. Ltd. stocks, and Shenzhen's Development 
Bank stocks -- but Shenyang and Shanghai and other localities 
also piloted the transfer of enterprise bonds and stocks, 
accumulating valuable experiences for the opening of secondary 
securities markets. 
  The second stage was the development stage from 1988 to 
1990. 
The turning point was the opening of the secondary securities 
markets. In April 1988, with the State Council's approval, 
Shenyang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan and other 
localities began testing the exchange markets for state treasury 
bonds. At the end of that year, the state treasury bond trading 
business quickly spread to the large- and medium-sized cities 
across the country. The opening of secondary markets for state 
treasury bonds not only spurred a large increase in the kinds 
and the volume of issuance of government bonds but also changed 
the concept of many purchasers, making the purchase of 
government bonds purely an act of investment. At the same time, 
it changed the traditional way many Chinese enterprises raised 
capital: they began to enter directly into the capital markets 
to gather funds. In Shanghai and Shenzhen in particular, the 
stock exchanges really developed. By 1990, Shanghai had seven 
shareholding companies listing their stocks in the exchange; 
Shenzhen had five listing companies. Over-the-counter trade was 
very brisk at that time, but for various reasons, the black 
market also ran rampant, and stock prices soared because of 
excess demand. 
  The beginning of the third stage was marked by the opening 
of 
the Shanghai Securities Exchange in December 1990. China's 
securities markets ended their disorganized over-the-counter 
trade and turned to organized market trading. The opening of the 
Shanghai Securities Exchange not only brought the trading of 
securities into the exchange but also introduced computerized 
match-up and paperless transactions, and in one stroke it caught 
up the technological development that took the Western stock 
markets nearly a century and the Asian Pacific region several 
decades to accomplish. It not only improved market efficiency 
but also practically eliminated black market transactions, 
taking the standardization of the securities market a big step 
forward. Subsequently the installation of the Beijing National 
Securities Trade Automated Quotations (STAQ) system was put into 
operation (on 5 December 1990), which was followed by the formal 
opening of the Shenzhen Exchange in July 1991. The development 
of China's securities markets entered a new historical phase. 
As securities trading became increasingly active, the market 
for securities issuance also expanded. At the end of 1991, 
special RMB stocks (B-shares) were issued, opening up a new 
channel to attract foreign investments via the stock market. 
  The fourth stage began in 1992. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
South China speech reaffirmed the reform experiments with the 
shareholding system and the securities markets. It became a 
strong force behind the reform and opening up. The securities 
markets and the entire process of the restructuring of the 
economic system helped propel each other into a new 
developmental phase. In early March 1992, the State 
Restructuring the Economic System Commission and the State 
Council's Economic and Trade Office convened the "Summary 
Meeting on the Experiences of the Trial Implementation of the 
Shareholding System" in Shenzhen. Based on the conclusions drawn 
at that meeting, the State Council handed down a document 
confirming the positive nature of the pilot shareholding system. 
Subsequently, the State Restructuring of the Economic System 
Commission and other related departments jointly issued the 
"Suggestions on Standardizing the Shareholding Limited Liability 
Companies" and more than a dozen of other individually drawn up 
laws and regulations, which played an active role in putting the 
shareholding pilot project on a legalized and standardized 
course. The pace of reform toward the shareholding system 
clearly picked up. Experimental points set up to issue stocks to 
the public spread from Shanghai and Shenzhen to Guangdong, 
Fujian, and Hainan. Nationwide, more than 5,000 enterprises 
converted to the shareholding system, issued stock publicly, or 
implemented the directional capital-raising system. In 1992, 53 
enterprises in Shanghai and 10 in Shenzhen issued stocks 
publicly, and adding the six kinds of out-of-town stocks from 
Hainan, Wuhan, and Shenyang traded in the Shenzhen and Shanghai 
exchanges, the scope of stock trading further expanded. 
Meanwhile, many new types of financial goods -- such as 
investment funds, stock subscription warrants, negotiable bonds, 
and investment profit bonds -- began to appear in the securities 
markets. The bond market and the stock market set each other off 
as both entered a phase of prosperity. 
<H5>  The State of China's Securities Markets </H5>
  1. The scope of the securities markets is constantly 
expanding: From 1981 to 1992, 381.7 billion yuan's worth of 
assorted negotiable securities were issued. They consisted of 
108.4 billion yuan in state treasury bonds, 39.7 billion yuan in 
financial bonds, 20 billion yuan in special state bonds and 
value-guaranteed public debts, 40.7 billion yuan in state 
investment bonds (including state construction bonds, state key 
construction bonds, and basic construction bonds), 96 billion 
yuan in enterprise bonds, 61 billion yuan in financial bonds, 
and 15.9 billion yuan in stocks. Securities issued in 1992 were 
worth 128 billion yuan. The bulk -- nearly one-third -- of 
securities in the securities issuance market were government 
bonds, and if we add the government-guaranteed state investment 
bonds, they would exceed 40 percent. 
  The securities circulation market was also extremely active 
last year. Volume of exchange in the organized markets topped 
104.4 billion yuan, among them, bond volume (primarily state 
bonds) topped 35.1 billion yuan. Volume of trade in stocks was 
69.2 billion yuan, 12.4 times more than the 5.1 billion yuan 
traded in 1991. Specifically, the Shenzhen Exchange's volume 
was 44 billion yuan while trading in the Shanghai Exchange was 
worth 24.8 billion yuan. 
  So far, a total of 110 companies are listed in Shanghai and 
Shenzhen. There are 108 A-shares and 30 B-shares. Their combined 
market value is nearly 300 billion yuan. Transactions in the tw 
o exchanges so far this year are worth more than 170 billion 
yuan. 
  2. An exchange market system is gradually taking shape: 
China's securities exchange markets are gradually taking on a 
format that combines organized and decentralized trading. The 
organized exchange markets include the "two exchanges" and the 
"two networks." The "two exchanges" refer to the Shanghai 
Securities Exchange and the Shenzhen Exchange, and the "two 
networks" refer to the National Securities Trade Automated 
Quotations Syste m (STAQ) and the National Electronic Trading 
System (NET). Securities traded on the two Exchanges are mainly 
personal shares issued by the listing companies. After the STAQ 
system began piloting the trading of state treasury bonds and 
legal person shares, the NET system also began trading legal 
person shares. The decentralized exchange markets refer to the 
3,000 securities business outlets around the country. They 
include securities companies, outlets of the securities business 
department of trust and investment companies, and securities 
agencies of banks and credit cooperatives that trade bonds the 
over-the-counter. 
  3. A securities market management system is taking shape: 
The 
State Council's Securities Exchange Commission (the Securities 
Commission for short) and the Chinese Securities Supervisory and 
Administrative Commission (Securities Supervisory Commission for 
short) were founded in October of last year. The Securities 
Commission is in charge of the macroeconomic management of the 
country's secur ities markets. It is made up of leading 
comrades of the State Council's relevant ministries and 
commissions. Its basic duties are to formulate laws and draft 
legal provisions pertaining to the securities markets; to study 
and formulate general and specific policies and rules and 
regulations pertaining to the securities markets; to darw up the 
securities markets' development program and annual plans; to 
guide, coordinate, supervise, and check the performances of 
securities market-related tasks of different regions and 
departments. It is also in charge of the Securities Supervisory 
Commission. 
  The Securities Supervisory Commission is the executive organ 
of the Securities Commission. It is made up of experts with 
professional knowledge and practical experiences in securities. 
Its main responsibilities, as empowered by the Securities 
Commission, are to formulate securities market management rules; 
monitor the way companies in the securities business handle 
their trade, especially how they handle their stock trading 
business; legally supervise the issuance and exchange of 
negotiable securities and the companies that issue stocks 
publicly; supervise and monitor domestic enterprises that issue 
stocks abroad; work with the relevant departments to compile 
securities statistics, study and analyze the securities market 
and promptly report to the Securities Commission and make 
suggestions. The State Council's relevant departments and local 
governments also have specific securities management 
responsibilities . The State Planning Commission is responsible 
for formulating and balancing the securities plans. The 
Financial Ministry is responsible for matters relating to 
national debt and is in charge of the chartering of accountants 
and accounting firms. The People's Bank is responsible for 
examining and approving and managing the securities business 
companies. Local governments are in charge of securities 
exchanges within their jurisdiction. The securities industry's 
self-disciplinary [ZILUXING] organizations consist mainly of the 
Chinese Securities Trade Association and the Chinese National 
Debt Association. 
  4. Securities organizations and intermediaries are growing 
rapidly: As the securities industry continues to expand, 
financial institutions that can handle securities business and 
intermediaries serving the securities industry also continue to 
increase. At the end of 1992, among the financial institutions 
approved to manage securities, there were 85 securities 
companies, 386 trust and investment c ompanies, and more than 
1,200 securities departments set up within the trust and 
investment companies and multipurpose banks. In addition, there 
were 2,000 outlets set up by banks and credit cooperatives, and 
we also had more than 500 securities intermediaries, primarily 
accounting firms, auditing companies, law firms, property 
appraisal companies, credit assessment companies or offices, 
securities investment consultation companies and so on. To 
strengthen the management of intermediary service organizations 
and improve their service quality, the Chinese Securities 
Supervision Commission and other relevant departments have 
evaluated the credentials of intermediaries dealing with 
securities. In addition, membership in the Shanghai and Shenzhen 
exchanges have also been increasing. At the end of last year, 
the Shanghai Securities Exchange had 171 members and the 
Shenzhen Exchange had 151 members. 
  5. Laws regulating the securities markets are gradually 
being 
perfected. When stock market pilot projects were first set up in 
Shanghai and Shenzhen, the main laws we had were the "Temporary 
Regulations on Managing the Shanghai Securities Exchange," 
"Temporary Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange 
in Shenzhen," and the "Temporary Method for Managing the 
Securities Companies." Here it should be pointed out that 
socialist China has just promulgated the first set of "Temporary 
Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange" on 4 May of 
this year. It was drawn up based on Shanghai's and Shenzhen's 
and other localities' laws and regulations. It marked the first 
step toward creating a set of unified national laws and 
regulations for China's securities markets, and it was also an 
important result of the restructuring of the economic system. It 
was no small accomplishment. The "Regulations" starts out from 
China's actual conditions and also references usual 
international practices. Its purpose is to protect the interests 
of the investors and promote the standardization of the 
securities markets, especially the stock market, so that the 
stock market has regulations to follow and laws to abide by. Of 
course, this is just the beginning, and in the future, we still 
have much work to do with regard to setting up a legal system 
for the securities markets. 
  Clearly, the birth and development of China's securities 
markets played and is still playing a positive role in the 
country's economic reform and development. To sum up, first, 
they raise capital for economic construction. The securities m 
arkets' main function is to turn society's scattered funds into 
long-term capital through the issuance of stocks and bonds; they 
provide a source of long-term capital to fund the nation's 
economic constructions. This is more obvious in regards to 
government bonds and enterprise bonds. However, although the 
scope of stock issuance is smaller, it is growing rapidly, and 
for this reason, enterprises that raise capital by issuing 
stocks are also growing rapidly. Second, they help curb 
inflation. Generally speaking, stocks and bonds are direct 
means of raising capital. Compared to indirect means of 
gathering funds through banks, direct fund gathering does not 
change the total money supply and does not produce the 
multiplier effect of increased money supply; instead, by 
absorbing society's idle funds, they change the mix of society's 
financial assets and ease the pressure of society's total 
demand. Furthermore, direct fund gathering puts more stringent 
demands on enterprises, prompting them to improve efficiency, 
thus it accelerates the flow-back of credit funds and helps to 
curb inflation. Third, they promote changes in the state-owned 
enterprises' management mechanisms and accelerate enterprises' 
market-orientation process. Conversion to the shareholding 
system has clarified enterprises' property rights, changed the 
old situation where nobody would take responsibility for the 
management of state-owned enterprises' properties, and has 
brought about the separation of ownership rights and management 
rights. As a result, enterprises can gradually end their 
dependence on different levels of government and can make their 
own management decisions and take responsibility for their own 
profits and losses. When shareholding enterprises issue stocks 
and raise capital in society, it means they must accept the 
supervision of tens of thousands of shareholders, and this 
forces them to improve management and administration and to 
diligently improve their economic efficiency. Fourth, they help 
achieve optimal allocation of resources. The securities markets 
have smashed the pattern of planned fund allocation and have 
made the market the basis of resource allocation. Implementing 
the shareholding system not only subjects the incremental assets 
to the market's regulation but also puts the existing asset base 
in the market where they can be readjusted. Today, local 
governments are very selective and strict about enterprises that 
issue stocks, and this gives the nation's bottleneck industries 
and well-managed and efficient enterprises ample opportunity to 
develop. How well or how poorly the enterprises are managed 
also determines the flow of society's funds, creating the 
competitive mechanisms whereby the inferior are eliminated by 
the superior, and in turn society's funds are guided to the 
profitable industries and enterprises, achieving optimal 
allocation of resources. Last, they promote the formation of a 
socialist market system. A fairly complete market system should 
be a system that integrates the commoditi es market and the fund 
market. The securities markets are an important component of the 
fund market, and their development and improvement not only 
promote the formation of the fund market but also accelerate the 
improvement of the commodities market. This is because 
enterprises are the market's principal players. The better they 
can compete in the commodities market and the better off they 
are, the more they can raise capital in the fund market. These 
are flip sides of the same process. Increasingly , the 
development of China's securities markets is proving that they 
can play a positive role in this area. 
<H3>  Existing Problems in the Development of the Securities 
Markets </H3>
  Looking at the course of development of China's securities 
markets, today, we still have some major problems that need to 
be considered carefully and resolved. 
  1. The question of regulating enterprises' conversion to the 
shareholding system: 
  Enterprises' conversion to the shareholding system must be 
regulated; their public issuance and listing of stocks must meet 
very strict standards. This is the cornerstone of the stock 
market's healthy development. Today, the lack of standardization 
in enterprises' conversion to the shareholding system is 
manifested in the following ways: One, in converting to the 
shareholding system, some enterprises fail to assess their 
properties accurately, resulting in underestimation of the book 
value and loss of the state's assets. Two, when they engage in 
directional capital raising, they often do not limit themselves 
to issuing shares internally to their own staff and workers, and 
as a result, "internal shares are made public and legal person 
shares are sold to individuals," which in turn leads to the 
black market trading of equity rights. Three, some regions do 
not follow the central government's legal instructions when they 
convert to the shareholding system; they do not follow procedure 
and submit reports as required and often lower the examination 
and approval standards. Four, share holding companies that have 
issued and listed their stocks are slow in changing their 
management mechanisms; their shareholders' meetings exist in 
name only, and there is no safeguard for the shareholders' 
rights and privileges. For these reasons, the State 
Restructuring of the Economic System Commission in conjunction 
with other relevant departments have issued some documents on 
standardization, asking the localities and enterprises to comply 
with their requests and work diligently when enterprises conv 
ert to the shareholding system. Only when an enterprise is truly 
ready should it issue stocks and become a listing company; we 
must not blindly pursue quantity by sacrificing quality. 
Enterprises' asset appraisal must be accurate; the delineation 
of property rights must be clear. We must follow the accounting 
system formulated for the shareholding system when changing 
enterprises' accounting system. We must set up and perfect 
enterprises' internal management system. The shareholders' 
meetings, board of directors' meetings, and supervisory meetings 
must be organized according to standard proposals. We must truly 
change enterprises' operating mechanisms and improve their 
ability to discipline themselves. It should be pointed out that 
as we open up to the outside world and as enterprises get into 
the market, the transformation of the shareholding companies 
should follow international standards even closer to become 
internationalized. 
  2. The question of the publicly owned shares: 
  In changing to the shareholding system, we must uphold the 
primary role of the socialist public ownership system and 
guarantee the preservation and appreciation of the value of the 
state-owned assets. This is a fundamental premise. From the 
point of the scope of the pilot project to set up shareholding 
enterprises, enterprises involved with national security and 
state-of-the-art national defense technologies, projects 
involving the mining of rare metals of strategic importance, and 
industries and enterprises that must be monopolized by the 
state should continue to be run by the state. For the energy, 
transportation, and communications and other fairly monopolistic 
industries which are the focus of development under the state's 
industry policy, the state must retain controlling interest when 
they test the shareholding system. At the same time, we must 
stipulate that a natural person cannot hold more than 0.5 
percent of the stocks of any one enterprise. This will basically 
guarantee the primary role of the public-ownership system in the 
national economy. 
  A major problem we are facing today is that the publicly 
owned shares cannot be traded in the market. The presence of 
these shares and the fact that they account for a fairly large 
percentage of all equity rights are important characteristics of 
China's shareholding system. The inability of large numbers of 
publicly owned shares to circulate not only violates the 
principle of equal equity rights and fails to guarantee the 
preservation and appreciation of the val ue of the publicly 
owned shares but also hinders enterprises' efforts to change 
their management mechanisms, making it difficult to achieve the 
original goals of the shareholding system. But the trading of 
pubicly owned stocks will involve a host of other reforms -- 
such as reform of the system of property rights in state-owned 
properties, and it involves the state-owned properties 
management and administration system and the question of the 
stock market's ability to handle those stocks. We must study 
this matter carefully. 
  3. The question of the pattern of development of the 
securities markets: 
  From the point of the internal structure of the securities 
markets, today, only about 10 percent of the directly-raised 
capital is raised by stocks. For some time to come, we will 
still rely mainly on bonds, supplemented by stocks. But 
currently, the bond market, especially treasury bonds, is in a 
slump, and we are "crippled." Those involved are working hard to 
review the experience and are taking effect ive measures to 
enliven the national debt market. Secondly, from the point of 
the distribution and the number of exchanges, there is a fairly 
wide east-west gap and a north-south gap in the development of 
the securities markets. Currently, the exchanges in Shenzhen and 
Shanghai are growing very rapidly; other regions are also 
actively setting up exchanges. Looking at international 
experiences, securities exchanges are always spread out in the 
beginning, but gradually they become relatively centralized. 
International experiences also show that a centralized market 
facilitates the proper allocation of fund resource, but it also 
tends to create monopoly and leads to inefficiency. More 
spread-out markets facilitate competition and improve 
efficiency, but if they are too spread-out, it can lead to 
market separatism and improper resource allocation. Thus, we 
must learn from other nations' experiences and lessons in 
developing securities markets, avoid detours, and make sure that 
the markets are neither too centralized nor too spread out. 
  4. The question of setting up a unified securities 
monitoring 
and administration system: 
  To make sure that the monitoring and administration of the 
securities markets is uniform, efficient, and fair, nations have 
set up specialized securities monitoring and administration 
organs. Countries that rely mainly on government departments to 
administer the stock markets have also set up specialized organs 
to strengthen market supervision and administration after 
experiencing stock market disasters. The creation of the State 
Council's Securities Commission and Securities Supervisory 
Commission was a first step toward smashing the old pattern of 
putting too many departments in charge. These two agencies have 
done much to smooth the relations among different departments 
and between central and local governments, laying the foundation 
for our monitoring and administrative tasks. 
  Based on the securities markets', especially the stock 
market's, characteristics, we must gi ve full play to the 
self-disciplinary organs. Therefore, we must turn the Securities 
Trade Association into a bona fide self-disciplinary organ and 
strengthen the securities business organizations' own 
administration and monitoring procedure. In particular, we must 
give full play to the accounting firms, the law firms, and other 
civilian "economic police," so as to strengthen social 
supervision. We must give full play to the securities exchanges' 
functions, strengthen the supervision and administration of the 
listing companies, stock exchange members, and the exchange 
process. In short, while we strengthen the government's 
supervision and administration of the stock market, we must give 
even more play to the market mechanisms and set up a securities 
market supervision and management system to oversee the 
government management organs, the securities industry's 
self-disciplinary organs, and the intermediaries at separate 
levels and make them take responsibility for themselves while 
working together harmoniously. China's securities supervision 
and administration system will be perfected gradually as the 
securities markets develop and as we accumulate experience. The 
preliminary supervision and administration system we have set up 
today is a major breakthrough, but there are still many problems 
and contradictions which have not been completely sorted out, 
and they must be gradually resolved. 
  5. The question of developing institutional investors to 
improve the mix of investors: 
  Because it is a relatively young market, currently, most 
investors in China's stock market are individual households. 
They know relatively little about risks and can afford to take 
little risk. They are susceptible to rumors and tend to follow 
others blindly in and out of the market, making the market more 
volatile and bringing losses to themselves. As the scope of the 
stock market continues to expand, developing institutional 
investors becomes a pressing issue. Today, we are in the process 
of implementing reform of the social security system. We should 
permit all kinds of insurance funds to get into the stock market 
in the form of long-term investment. At the same time, we should 
develop mutual funds and let professionals invest money for the 
medium-sized and small investors, so as to lower the risks of 
individual investors and make more profit for everyone. 
Institutional investors have special significance in China: Once 
organized, they will turn into legal entities and will no longer 
be private investments, thus satisfying the principle of making 
the public-ownership system the primary system and accelerating 
the development of the shareholding system and the stock market. 
Meanwhile, investing funds can effectively combat the rich 
clients' improper manipulation of the market, and we can make 
investments less of a gambler's game and turn short-term 
investments into long-term investments. The development of funds 
will make it easier for the publicly owned shares to be traded 
in the market and for the party and go vernment cadres to 
participate. But we must formulate laws as soon as possible, and 
fund development must be orderly and gradual. We should not 
develop closed-end funds, however. Some comrades say that 
closed-end funds are "more like stocks than stocks," and some 
say they are conducive to "speculations at both ends": At one 
end, money can be pooled to speculate on stocks, and at the 
other end, people can also speculate on the fund certificates 
which are traded in the market. In addition, issuing funds 
through internal allocation can cause more serious problems than 
those created by stock issuance. In my opinion, we should 
develop open-end funds. People can get in and out; the 
securities are not traded on the market. This is safer and 
better. 
  6. The question of using the securities markets to attract 
more foreign capital: 
  Since the 1980's, circulation of international capital has 
been achieved primarily through the raising of share capital 
rather than debt financing. In the early days of refo rm and 
opening up, we relied primarily on foreign businesses' direct 
investments and commercial loans to attract foreign funds. In 
the wake of the development of China's securities markets, 
especially with the rise of the stock market, we have been able 
to adapt to the changing trends and satisfy foreign business's 
desire to invest in Chinese enterprises through stock purchases, 
and the issuance of stock to attract foreign capital has been 
put on top of the agenda since. Generally speaking, the goal of 
investing in China and sharing the economic fruits and profits 
can be reached equally through direct investments and stock 
purchases; the results are basically the same. But buying stocks 
makes the foreign businesses' investments even more versatile. 
They can buy and sell stocks as a way to choose their investment 
style and make more profit. Meanwhile, if China should modify or 
change its policies (or if foreign businesses believe that 
things are risky), they can promptly reduce or abandon their 
investment plans in China. Direct investments are not as 
convenient. Thus, issuing stocks to attract foreign capital is a 
new, more versatile way of raising capital. For this reason, in 
1991, we began experimenting with issuing B-shares which were 
sold only to people living outside of Chinese territories. It 
was the first time we used equity rights to raise foreign 
capital, and it marked the first step in opening up the 
securities markets. Looking at the results of that experiment, 
it was a success. Since last year we have been studying Chinese 
enterprises that listed their stocks overseas. The merit of 
this approach is that it helps to make Chinese enterprises 
better known abroad and encourages enterprises to get into the 
international markets. It also introduces us to the advanced 
management experiences of foreign securities industry and helps 
us improve our own management of the securities markets. Through 
consultation with the Hong Kong United Stock Exchange and 
Securities Commission and others, and after reaching a 
consensus, four companies, including the Shanghai Petrochemical 
Company and Qingdao Brewery, have gone public in Hong Kong with 
their H-shares since July. They are traded on the Allied 
Exchange. This move has successfully opened up a new channel for 
utilizing foreign funds. 
<H5>  Further Developing and Perfecting the Securities Markets </H5>
  As the socialist market economic system develops further, 
the 
securities markets must also become more sophisticated in order 
to adapt to the ever accelerating rate of economic growth. 
Thus, our main task in the next stage is to perfect the 
securities markets' many imperfections. 
  1. Let the securities markets operate within the scope of a 
complete legal system: 
  It is a long process to draw up securities laws and 
regulations from scratch, and it is a long process to perfect 
those laws and regulations. Since the formation of the 
specialized supervisory and management organs last year, we have 
immediately worked on the formulation of other relevant laws and 
regulations. The State Council has just formally promulgated the 
"Temporary Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange," 
and the "Trial Method of Managing the Securities Exchanges" has 
also been announced by the Securities Commission. These are 
important steps toward standardizing the ways the securities 
markets operate. 
  But China's securities law and regulation system is still 
imperfect. In particular, the "Corporate Law" and "Securities 
Law" and other basic laws and regulations are still being 
formulated. Today, besides focusing on the formulation of the 
"Corporate Law" and "Securities Law," we must work on the 
introduction of the "Method To Prevent Inside Trading and 
Fraud," "Regulations on the Management of State-Owned Stocks," 
"Code of Conduct for Securities Industry Personnel," "Method of 
Managing Domestic Enterprises' Issuance and Listing of Stocks 
Abroad," and other pertinent laws and regulations and the 
"detailed rules" of their implementation, so as to he lp the 
securities markets operate and develop steadily under a perfect 
legal system. 
  2. Smooth out the market's operating mechanisms: 
  We must have smooth and coordinated market mechanisms in 
order to give full play to the functions of the securities 
markets. To perfect China's securities market mechanisms, we 
must not only learn from international experiences but also take 
into consideration China's own conditions. 
  First, we must make the market more transparent, that is, we 
must make sure that all market information are made public. We 
did not do this a few years ago. The managing departments only 
asked that some information be disclosed at the time stocks were 
issued, and the investors knew very little about the listing 
enterprises. We did not have a system requiring full disclosure 
of information about the listing companies. The system of full 
disclosure is stipulated in the just-promulgated "Temporary 
Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange" and 
"Detailed Rules on Disclosure of Information on Companies 
Issuing Stocks." We must strictly enforce this provision. 
  Second, we must smash separatism and promote the creation of 
a unified market. We have made great improvements in this area 
in the last few years, but there are still incidents of regional 
blockade and disregard of regulations, which obstruct the 
formation of a unified market. To solve this problem, we must 
work hard on the system as well as on the technical aspects. For 
example, we must have uniform laws and reg ulations, improve the 
exchanges, and acquire the technology and equipment to 
accommodate out-of-town membership. 
  Third, we must study the question of circulation of publicly 
owned shares. In the pilot projects in the past, those shares 
basically could not be traded, and only personal shares could be 
traded in the market, which made it impossible for the stock 
market to fulfill its function to make structural adjustments of 
the state-owned asset base. This problem must be solved, but it 
is a complicated problem, because it involves the property 
rights system and the system of management and administration of 
state-owned properties. 
  Furthermore, we must also reform and unify the listing 
companies' tax, financial, personnel, and wage systems and so 
on. We must actively give play to the functions of the 
intermediaries in the securities markets. We must further 
improve the securities markets' settlement and trusteeship 
systems and support the markets with modern technologies. 
  3. Standardize enterprises' transformation under the 
shareholding system: 
  The shareholding companies operate very differently from the 
way the state-run enterprises operate. There are strict 
requirements put on the formers' internal power structure, 
profit allocation, reward policy, and administration and 
management. Today, everybody is going all out to transform 
enterprises under the shareholding system. They ignore 
standards, procedure, or requirements when reorganizing 
enterprises, and they have created many problems. Some 
enterprises just put a new label on the same old thing; their 
internal management mechanisms and decision-making structure 
have not changed. Others conceal important information, and 
shareholders incur losses as a result. Thus, we must exert some 
pressure and demand that enterprises follow regulations when 
converting to the shareholding system and that they truly change 
their management mechanisms, so that we can be sure that the 
listing companies are of high quality, and in turn, we can 
promot e the stock market's true prosperity. 
  4. Actively but steadily expand the scope of the stock 
market 
pilot project: 
  To develop the market economy, we must greatly expand the 
stock market's capacity to meet the demands of enterprises' 
diverse fund gathering activities. When we improved the markets' 
laws and regulations and market mechanisms, we also set the 
policy to expand the stock market pilot project nationwide. This 
year, in accordance with the relevant economic growth policies 
and based on the listing capacity of exchanges, every province 
(municipality) will have one or two enterprises issuing stocks 
to the public to raise capital. This is an arduous task, because 
it is a large-scale, far-reaching, nationwide project, and many 
localities have no experience. We have a lot of work to do. But 
it is a very important task. It represents a big step forward 
for China's stock market experiment. The securities markets will 
make it increasingly easier for enterprises to gather funds. As 
far as the securities markets themselves are concerned, 
expanding the pilot project means an important test and 
promotion of the development and improvement of their management 
system, the securities exchanges' operating mechanisms, the 
securities merchants' services, and other intermediary service 
organizations. On the one hand, it will help us uncover problems 
and deficiencies, so that we can promptly make remedies, and on 
the other hand, it will train different types of professionals 
and lay a sound foundation for future market development. 
  5. Continue to explore ways to utilize the stock market to 
attract foreign investments: 
  So far we have issued 30 B-share stocks. The experiments 
with 
B-shares prove that using the stock market to attract foreign 
capital is both versatile and effective. With regard to some of 
the problems in the B-shares market, we will step up efforts to 
come up with measures of improvement and will continue to 
experiment with the market. 
  The trading of H-shares in Hong Kong has basically been a 
success. The series of documents on laws, accounting, and joint 
supervision worked out between us and the Hong Kong Allied 
Exchange and Securities Commission can be valuable when we make 
use of the securities markets of other major countries to raise 
funds.

0005 3718): "Review of the Past and Prospects of the Future 
Performance of the Bank of Communications--Meeting the 
Challenges of Financial Reform"] 
  [Text] The State Council decided in 1986 for the Bank of 
Communications to resume domestic business operations. The 
leadership of the People's Bank of China pointed out at that 
time that this would be an experimental arrangement, that the 
Bank of Communications would operate as the bank of the reform, 
but not become a reform target. 
  What kind of an experiment will it then be, and what kind of 
a reform? 
<H3>  I. No More Feeding From the "Large Rice Bowl" in the 
Financial System </H3>
  The fundamental reasons for this kind of an experiment by 
China's financial establishment had been the sharp 
contradictions that had arisen since the start of reform and 
opening up to the outside world between the pressing needs for 
capital funds and China's inappropriate financial and monetary 
system. 
  Throughout the country, everybody wanted to start up 
large-scale developments, great undertakings, and new projects. 
All this needed money, and people rushed to the State Planning 
Commission and the Ministry of Finance, but that ministry's 
funds were limited. If some items were serviced, funds were 
short for others, and then the banks would be asked to grant 
loans. In the end, as loans were granted year after year, 
deficits increased year after year. Later, everybody got to know 
the ingenious way of "business on borrowed money," everybody 
borrowed from the banks, and economic development was being 
pursued with much borrowing, as expressed in such common sayings 
as "much in and much out," "borrow a hen to lay eggs," and 
"borrow a ship to sail the oceans." 
  Development was given priority, while reforms were being 
held 
up. In all quarters, high and low, right and left, pressure was 
put on the banks, as everybody tried to squeeze money out of 
them. 
  The organizational system of China's state banks was one of 
soft restraints, so that anyone clever enough could always 
squeeze some money out of the banks. If the lower-level banks 
would be out of cash, they would ask their superior 
establishments for allocations, and if these higher-ranking 
banks would be out of cash, they would ask for money supplies 
from the central bank. "Enterprises were feeding from the `large 
rice bowl' of the specialized banks, and the specialized banks 
were feeding from the `large rice bowl' of the People's Bank of 
China." This system of soft restraints left almost no other 
devices to the central bank and for the state in its 
macro-regulation and control of the economy than to take 
administrative measures, which would then "cut everything with 
one and the same knife." On the other hand, it is 
characteristic of administrative measures that "applied loosely, 
they will lead to chaos, and applying stricter restraint, they 
will be fatal strangleholds." Their remedies will only be 
superficial, and if applied repeatedly will inflict immeasurable 
damage on the Chinese economy. 
  Is there then no better way? 
<H3>  II. Indeed, One Ship Has Already Been Launched on its Long 
Experimental Journey </H3>
  Policymakers in China's financial establishment are now 
planning to change the said situation: First, a balance has to 
be established as between development and reform; it is just not 
possible under the old system of organization to maintain the 
drive for high-speed development. Second, the state's 
specialized banks are to be converted into state-owned 
commercial banks. These banks should truly become financial 
enterprises with autonomy in their business operations, 
responsibility for profits and losses, and that operate with 
self-restraint and responsibility for self-development. Third, 
separate banks shall be set up for "state policy-directed" 
operations. These banks shall be specially charged with the 
handling of all "state policy-directed" financial operations. 
Fourth, the position and functions of the central bank shall be 
strengthened. The second point in fact constitutes the core of 
the entire financial reform. 
  Reforming the banks as they presently exist will be an 
extremely protracted and arduous process. The fastest method 
would be to set up a new bank, operate it as an experiment, and 
if successful promote the experience on a broader scale. 
Finally, we may cite the case of the newly reconstituted Bank 
of Communications, which is already engaged in experimental 
operations since the end of 1986. 
  This is the first publicly owned bank of the shareholding 
system. The central bank, representing the state, is controlling 
23 percent of the shares, finance departments of various local 
governments are holding 42 percent, and various state-owned 
enterprises are holding 35 percent of the shares. 
  It is the first bank with a comprehensive sphere of business 
operations; it has the capability to transact at all times 
foreign remittance, securities, leasing, insurance, real estate, 
and investment business. 
  It is the first bank establishing branches throughout the 
country according to the location of economic centers, and not 
according to administrative regions. 
  It is the first commercial bank with responsibility for its 
own profits and losses, with autonomy in its business 
operations, with responsibility for self-development and 
self-restraints, bearing responsibility for risks taken, and, 
all of its own, endeavoring to maintain a well-balanced fund 
situation. 
  The central bank granted the Bank of Communications a large 
array of powers, which actually had been of the nature that the 
various large state-owned special banks at that time had yearned 
for for a long time. However, the central bank had decisively 
cut its links with the Bank of Communications as a supplier of 
funds. If the Bank of Communications should run out of cash, it 
might as well declare bankruptcy, but will definitely not be 
allowed to stretch out its hand to demand money from the central 
bank! This amounts to having the Bank of Communications, even 
though only recently reconstituted, so to say, fight with its 
back to the wall. 
<H5>  III. Victory in its Initial Battle </H5>
  On 10 December 1986, when the Bank of Communications had 
been 
operating in Shanghai on an experimental basis for not quite two 
months, it is very interesting to hear what some of its 
customers have to say during this period of its experimental 
operations. 
  The director of Shanghai No 7 Watch Factory said: "The Bank 
of Communications approached us on their own accord three times, 
inviting us to open an account with them. We have never before 
met with that much warmhearted enthusiasm...." 
  The director of the Shanghai Sports Shoe Main Factory said: 
"For many years we have tried to raise funds to build a new 
factory building, but have been rebuffed everywhere. Much steel 
material has been stored in the open and was getting rusty. It 
was then that the Bank of Communications helped us out with a 
loan, `sending charcoal in snowy weather,' as the saying is...." 
  After having been in business for four months, the Shanghai 
Branch of the Bank of Communications had taken in 530 million 
yuan of deposits at its deposit department; the per capita 
deposits exceeded 100 million yuan. 
  Li Xiangrui [2621 4382 3843], the then president of the Bank 
of Communications, went every day several times personally to 
the big hall of the bank building. He was that eager to have 
everybody come to the Bank of Communications! In the past, when 
he had been president of the People's Bank, he had never been so 
concerned about these kind of things. 
  After four years, the Nanpu Bridge project, that had 
attracted worldwide attention, has been completed. The one that 
had undertaken financial responsibility for this huge 
engineering project was none other than the Bank of 
Communications, as it had then just started operating. 
  At that time, the chief engineers were rather contemptuous 
of 
the young female whom the Bank of Communications had sent them 
as head of the bank's loan department. They even asked: "Bank 
of Communications? Never heard of it?" 
  After the spring and summer of 1989, the Asian Development 
Bank temporarily suspended further loans for the Nanpu Bridge 
project in Shanghai, and work came to a halt. It was then that 
the Bank of Communications bravely stepped forward, determined 
to make use of its own banking reputation in the international 
financial market to raise funds for the project. It was 
precisely the female employee of the loan department, whom those 
oldsters had treated contemptuously, who had arduously struggled 
on her computer for 10 days, produced a plan to raise funds for 
the project, and who had startled everybody with her expose at 
the meeting of those in authority, where her plan was 
immediately approved. 
  On 17 August 1988, the Bank of Communications issued in 
Singapore bonds to the amount of $100 million, which were an 
immediate success! 
<H3>  IV. Soul of the Bank of Communications: Control of 
Assets-Liabilities Ratio </H3>
  A person with inside knowledge of the Bank of Communications 
once said: "The soul of the Bank of Communications is control of 
its assets-liabilities ratio." 
  The basic cause for the phenomenon of "everybody feeding 
from 
the big iron banking bowl" was precisely that there was no firm 
self-restraint in matters of bank loans. The thousands of large 
and small banks shifted the pressures of society's demand for 
funds on to the shoulders of the central bank, compelling the 
central bank to again and again expand its scale, increase its 
currency issue, and thus create an uncontrolled situation as far 
as the currency was concerned. 
  What if all banks could themselves bear these pressures? 
  The Bank of Communications is a publicly owned bank of the 
shareholding system. Its ownership is separate from its 
management right. If it were to run out of money, its 
shareholders would not stand it, and management would have a 
hard time. 
  The Bank of Communications has therefore gradually perfected 
three large systems: One is the system of controlling the use 
ratio of funds, the other is the system of supervising and 
checking the quality of its assets, and the third is the system 
of composite analysis of its financial targets. These together 
may be called "the system of controlling the assets-liabilities 
ratio and the system of controlling the risks." 
  The major points of this system are: The total amount of 
loans must not exceed 85 percent of the aggregate of bank 
deposits plus capital funds plus annual accumulations. The 
provision of ready cash must not be lower than 15 percent of 
total deposits. Fiduciary loans must be limited to within 20 
percent of the total amount of loans. Overdue loans must be 
controlled to within 6 percent. Slow-moving and uncollectible 
accounts must be controlled to within 3 percent. 
  The Bank of Communications and its various branch 
institutions are setting up assets-liabilities control 
committees at every level. These will effect periodical checks, 
and on the basis of such decide on the promotion or transfer of 
managers and on the bonuses and welfare benefits for staff and 
workers. 
  Up to the end of last year, the Bank of Communications has 
not taken a penny of the central bank's money, but even had a 
deposit surplus of 12 billion yuan over loans. In transactions 
with associated banks, its short-term loans to them were 10.7 
billion yuan above short-term borrowing from them. Overdue, 
stagnant, and uncollectible loans accounted for 4.66 percent of 
all loans, and among these the uncollectible accounts amounted 
to 0.07 percent. 
  The assets of the Bank of Communications are, within the 
domestic financial system, undoubtedly first grade quality.

<F P=106> [Article by Xu Yuyun (1776 7183 0061) of the Agricultural </F>
Bank of China: "Several Suggestions on Perfecting the Rural 
Financial System"] 
  [Text] When Comrade Xiaoping toured Shanghai in 1991, he 
said, "Finance is very important. It is the core of the modern 
economy. Putting our finances in order is like making the right 
move that wins the chess game." This statement points out 
succinctly the important role and function of finance in the 
construction of the socialist market economy. To promote the 
establishment of the socialist market economic system, the 
pertinent departments are actively studying and drawing up a 
financial reform program. Here, this author would like to 
discuss his views on the overall program and on the development 
of an agricultural financial system. 
  In formulating the financial reform program, we must 
make theoretical preparations and also integrate the program 
with reality and pay attention to its manageability. 
  The introduction of reform programs has been slow. There has 
been one problem after another, and one important reason for 
that is that we do not have a clear understanding or a good 
grasp of the grass-roots situation and therefore the programs 
have not been very manageable. The central bank is plagued by 
this problem, and so is the Agricultural Bank. As a result, the 
old system basically has been rejected, but the new system has 
yet to be formulated. The rank and file below are uncertain and 
often cannot carry out even their regular tasks. 
  In view of this situation, we should pay special attention 
to 
the following two issues: 
  One, the reform measures must be in close touch with 
reality. 
We must investigate and study and acquire a good understanding 
of the situation at the grass-roots level, and thereupon, we can 
formulate the reform program. At the same time, when the 
higher-ups formulate a reform program, the grass-roots level 
comrades should be asked to participate, and their suggestions 
should be heeded; we must avoid doing everything behind closed 
doors. We must pay close attention to the manageability of the 
measures. Only in this way can we start out from reality, seek 
truth from facts, shoot the arrow at the target--have a specific 
goal, and pour water off a steep roof--operating from a 
strategically advantageous position. Only then can we avoid 
unnecessary repetition and loss and the reform measures can be 
put into effect successfully. 
  Two, we must be decisive in implementing financial reform 
and 
try to achieve our goals in one step where possible. After the 
reform measures are introduced, we must implement them with 
resolution. If the new system is not quickly established, the 
army's morale will be shaken and the troops will be unstable, 
and some organs may become shortsighted--behaving improperly 
from the ideological and organizational point of view, which 
will adversely affect their everyday tasks and in turn 
jeopardize the entire economic development. We must be decisive 
when decisions are called for; otherwise, we may incur huge 
losses. Agricultural Bank's profit is down this year. That has 
something to do with the slow pace of the restructuring of the 
economic system and our indecisiveness. The grass-roots organs 
have been too eager to get their freedom and find their own 
fortune and have not settled down to work. Some of the original 
measures have been suspended, and the grass-roots offices have 
lost their initiative and their enthusiasm. The second point is 
that we must try to achieve our reform goals in one step where 
possible. We might as well cut short the lingering pain and do 
what we set out to do as quickly as possible and then settle 
down to tackle our work. We must keep this principle in mind 
when installing organs and arranging systems and 
personnel-hiring mechanisms. We should treasure and seize the 
opportunity before us and do a good job with the reform of the 
financial institutions, give full play to the central role of 
finance in a modern economy, and promote the establishment of 
China's socialist market economic system and the economy's 
sustained, smooth, and speedy development. 
  With regard to rural financial reform, the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th Party Central Committee's decision pointed 
out that China's Agricultural Bank should be reorganized to take 
on clearly defined policy-oriented business and that rural 
cooperative banks and urban cooperative banks should be set up 
step by step where necessary. The Central Committee's decision 
was a correct one. The rural financial system should be put in 
the context of the overall situation. Specifically, I have the 
following suggestions: 
  The idea of setting up agricultural policy-oriented 
banks is correct, but we must pay attention to their 
efficiency. 
  In terms of the restructuring of the rural financial system 
as a whole, it is essential that we separate policy-oriented 
from business-oriented undertakings. This suits today's 
condition of rural economic reform and facilitates the 
restructuring of the rural economy and the financial system as a 
whole. If we fail to make the separation, specialized banks 
cannot emerge as commercial banks. As far as the rural financial 
system is concerned, it still has arduous agricultural aid, 
poverty relief, and economic development responsibilities. The 
separation can help to guarantee the fulfillment of those 
responsibilities. 
  What are policy-oriented banks? It is difficult to define 
policy-oriented undertakings. The line between policy-oriented 
and business-oriented undertakings is often blurred. Does 
policy-orientation necessarily imply money-losing ventures? This 
is not necessarily true. 
  One, what are policy-oriented banks? Policy-oriented banks 
or 
policy-oriented udertakings refer to supporting certain projects 
in accordance with the government's macro program or industrial 
policy or intention. This kind of support does not seek 
immediate profit, but in the long-run, it does produce economic 
benefits, although it takes a longer period of time. The 
principle behind fund utilization is profit maximization. Some 
of the large-scale policy-oriented projects the Agricultural 
Bank once supported, such as the Huanghuahai development and the 
Sanjiang basin development projects, were also profit-oriented. 
Our overall goal is to turn banks into bona fide banks. 
Policy-oriented banks are also banks. If they keep losing money, 
they will not be banks. This point should be made very clear. 
  Two, policy-oriented banks' fund sources: One source is 
funds 
which the state used to appropriate but now lends out to banks. 
They are state funds. Another source is the central bank's basic 
currency (re-lending funds). This guarantees some low-cost 
funds. A third source is the citizens' savings deposits and 
enterprise deposits and so on which the policy-oriented banks 
themselves must work hard to attract. When they make loans, they 
can be business-oriented and should make sure that there is 
profit to be made, or at least they are not lending money at 
below cost. This is clearly different [as published] as 
commercial banks do business. 
  Three, the installation of policy-oriented banks: We must 
consider fully the realities of rural economic development and 
install organs according to economic divisions, such as in 
agricultural development areas and old liberated, minority 
nationality, border, and remote areas; we should install fewer 
or no organ in the coastal and other economically well-developed 
regions. Policy-oriented banks can handle some commercial 
business, but commercial banks must not seek funds earmarked for 
policy-oriented undertakings. This is a necessary administrative 
intervention; otherwise it will dampen the enthusiasm of 
policy-oriented banks. These banks' organ installation, fund 
sources, and interest policy must give expression to the term 
"policy-oriented." They should be selective about certain 
reform-oriented undertakings; they can enhance their ability to 
tackle policy-oriented undertakings. 
  Four, policy-oriented banks must assume diverse functions. 
The goal is to turn them into open, multipurpose, and modern 
banks. They should handle international businesses, including 
utilizing funds from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and 
United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization, but they 
must not bring in foreign commercial loans. 
  In short, first and foremost, policy-oriented banks are 
banks. They are not government agencies nor institutions, nor 
are they the old, single-purpose Agricultural Bank. When we 
plan, organize, and operate policy-oriented banks, we must put 
them in the context of an international environment and the 
greater environment of the market economy. 
  The installation of rural commercial banks must be 
within definite regional boundaries. 
  China's rural areas have gone through more than a decade of 
reform, and the development of the market economic system has 
actually preceded that in the urban areas, and the rural 
economy, especially the market economy, has developed rapidly. 
It now requires the services of other compatible financial 
institutions. The rapid growth of all types of enterprises in 
the rural areas can provide fund sources for the commercial 
banks, and facilitated by the bank's services, they can further 
develop. A strong and well-developed rural economy can provide 
more tax revenues for the state. This creates a benign cycle. 
  The installation of commercial banks require definite 
regional boundaries. Commercial banks should not be set up in 
poverty-striken regions; otherwise, they may draw funds away 
from the policy-oriented banks. In the economically 
well-developed regions, the Agricultural Bank should be 
reorganized into a commercial bank. Commercial banks should be 
set up according to international standards. We should smash all 
kinds of rigid conventions, so that many commercial financial 
institutions can exist in the same region, creating a 
competitive situation and promoting better services. 
  It should be pointed out that setting up policy-oriented 
banks is not the wisest choice. We should say that it is but a 
transitional measure. Even after the policy-oriented banks are 
set up, we still need a state-policy to guide the commercial 
banks. For example, the state should have an incentive policy 
when commercial banks voluntarily grant policy-oriented loans. 
The general principle is to walk on two legs and make sure that 
the state's policy-oriented undertakings are accomplished. In 
this respect, we can learn from the successful experiences of 
France and Thailand and other nations. 
  Reform of the rural credit organs should give 
expression to the principle of providing classified guidance and 
step by step implementation. 
  When talking about reform of the rural cooperative financial 
institutions, it should be pointed out emphatically that they 
were created and developed at a time when the cooperative 
agricultural economy and the productive forces were 
underdeveloped, and therefore we must give full expression to 
the principle of classified guidance and step by step 
implementation: In regions where the market economy is 
well-developed, resources are regulated primarily by the market; 
the environment has changed, the management standards are 
higher, and they are financially stronger. People whom the 
cooperatives used to serve and who bought shares now own only 
nominal shares. Credit cooperatives exist in name only today; 
the cooperative economic base is gone. Therefore there is a need 
to reorganize them into agricultural cooperative banks. Promptly 
setting up urban cooperative banks is practical in the 
economically better-developed cities. In the poverty-striken 
regions, the commodity economy is underdeveloped; they still 
have a natural or semi-natural economy. Individual producers 
have limited financial strength; they need the services of 
credit cooperative-type organizations. Because this kind of 
regional credit cooperative is small in scale, they cannot be 
managed like cooperative banks. We must not use the same 
measures across the board or lump everything together; we must 
deal with different situations in different ways. The rise and 
fall of rural credit cooperatives throughout history should be a 
lesson to us.

<F P=106> [Article by Han Jun (7281 0193): "Use of Intensified Reform </F>
Methods To Solve the Problems That Rural Villages Face -- An 
Interview With Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang"] 
  [Text] The Minister of Agriculture, Comrade Liu Jiang, 
recently agreed to be interviewed by this journal's deputy 
editor. During the interview, he set forth systematically his 
own views about the current state of agriculture and the rural 
economy, as well as how to concentrate on the reform goals of 
building a socialist market economy system, intensifying rural 
reform, and steadily developing the rural economy. The substance 
of the interview has been collated below for the reader. 
  Remarks in italics are those of this journal's deputy 
editor, 
Han Jun. 
  Remarks in regular type are those of Minister Liu Jiang. 
  Ever since 1992, China's national economy has been in a 
new stage of making an all-out transition to a market economy 
and high growth. During this period, some incongruities in the 
development of agriculture have manifested themselves rather 
strongly. Agricultural problems have once again become a focus 
of general concern for society as a whole. Not long ago, the 
Central Committee convened a special rural work committee 
meeting in this regard, which studied strategic approaches and 
specific actions to be taken to buttress the basic position of 
agriculture, and to move China's agriculture and rural economy 
another step upward in the course of building a socialist market 
economy system. Against this background, how do you look at the 
current situation in agriculture and the rural economy? 
  Overall, the situation in agriculture and the rural economy 
throughout the country is good. Since the remarks of Comrade 
Xiaoping during his travels in the south, and the Fourteenth 
Party Congress' setting of the reform goal of establishing a 
socialist market economy, the pace of rural reform and 
development have quickened appreciably. In 1992, more than 2,000 
counties, 282 prefectures and cities, and 29 provinces 
(autonomous regions and directly administered municipalities 
throughout the country decontrolled grain procurement and 
marketing prices. In 1993, command-style plans in agricultural 
production and plans for the allocation of grain among provinces 
were abolished throughout the country. Second, a large number of 
all sorts of new rural economic organization forms have come to 
the fore. These include share cooperative system enterprises, 
peasant vocational (and technical) associations, rural 
cooperative funds, and organizations that integrate trade, 
industry and agriculture. Third, agricultural production is 
developing steadily, and readjustment of the internal structure 
of agriculture has quickened further. A bumper grain crop was 
harvested for 4 years in a row between 1982 and 1992. In 1992, 
national grain output reached 442.66 million tons, up 1.7 
percent from the previous year. Output of all crops except 
cotton, which fell 20 percent due to natural disasters, 
increased in varying degrees. Animal husbandry and aquatic 
products production maintained a steady growth momentum, outputs 
of meat and aquatic products nationwide increasing 9.1 and 15 
percent respectively over 1992. During the first half of 1993, 
summer grain production reached an all-time high, and the 
outlook for grain production for the whole year is much better 
than was estimated at the beginning of the year. Between January 
and June, outputs of all major farm products increased in 
varying degrees except for rape seed, which fell 12.5 percent. 
Outputs of meat, dairy products, eggs, and aquatic products 
increased 5, 3, 5, and 9.7 percent respectively over the same 
period in 1992. Not only did total output of farm products 
increase, but agricultural production began to change from 
mostly efforts to increase outputs to gaining "higher yields, 
premium products, and high returns." Output of premium quality 
agricultural products increased steadily. Fourth, township and 
town enterprises entered a new stage of high growth. In 1992, 
the gross output of township and town enterprises totaled 1.76 
trillion yuan, up 51 percent from the previous year. During the 
same year, more than 9 million new people entered the rural work 
force. Rural staff members and workers totaled 105.81 million, 
which is more than the total number of staff members and workers 
in state-owned enterprises. Foreign exchange earnings from 
exports in 1993 broke the 119.2 billion yuan mark, accounting 
for 42 percent of the total value of commodity procurement for 
export nationwide. Tax payments to the state totaled 63.69 
billion yuan, 18.23 billion yuan more than in 1992. Township and 
town enterprises continued to maintain a high speed growth 
momentum between January and June 1993, gross output value 
increasing 70 percent over the same period in 1992. Fifth, 
peasant income increased. In 1992, peasant per capita income 
nationwide grew more rapidly than during the previous three 
years, reaching 784 yuan. After deducting for price rises, this 
was a 5.9 percent increase. After deducting for price increases, 
peasant income increased by an actual seven percent between 
January and June 1993. In short, advances in rural reform, and 
rapid growth of the rural economy played a leading role, a 
ground breaking role, and a model role in hastening the 
development of a market economy nationwide. They lay a 
foundation for promoting growth in the entire national economy, 
and they provided the basic material support needed to enrich 
the livelihoods of city and countryside residents alike, to curb 
inflation, and to maintain social order. 
  While fully affirming the achievements in rural reform and 
development of recent years, it is also necessary to understand 
clearly that both the development of agriculture and the rural 
economy are facing numerous deep-seated inconsistencies and 
limiting factors in a new situation in which the national 
economy is making a complete transition to a market economy and 
high growth. The most conspicuous manifestation of these 
inconsistencies are, first, city and countryside residents 
incomes are not increasing at the same rate. The gap between 
city and countryside income has widened further. Between 1989 
and 1992, peasant per capita net income increased by an average 
only 1.8 percent per year. This was very much out of line with 
the annual average 5.2 percent increase in the gross output of 
agriculture. The slow growth of peasant income contrasts sharply 
with the income growth of city and town residents. The gap 
between city and countryside income has increased from the 
1.72:1 ratio of 1984 to a 2.33:1 ratio in 1992. Agricultural 
production increases, but peasant income does not increase along 
with it. In fact, it may even decrease. This is a grim problem 
that China's agriculture has faced in recent years. Second, 
industry and agriculture do not grow in unison. The danger of a 
recurrence of unbalanced growth of industry and agriculture 
exists. In 1992, the industrial growth rate was 20.8 percent, 
making 1992 the highest growth year since reform and opening up 
to the outside world. The growth rate for agriculture was 3.7 
percent. This included only 1.2 percent growth in farming. The 
growth ratio between industry and agriculture was 5.6 to 1. 
During 1993, industrial growth momentum remains very strong. The 
gap between industrial and agricultural growth remains very 
great. The high growth of industry has led a large rise in the 
prices of all intermediary input prices, the cost and price of 
agricultural means of production rising greatly in consequence. 
As of the end of June 1993, prices of the agricultural means of 
production had risen 16.5 percent, while the procurement price 
index for agricultural and sideline products for the same period 
rose less than 6 percent. At the same time, driven by 
comparative benefits, large amounts of agricultural development 
funds flowed into non-agricultural industries. Consequently, 
investment in agriculture --particularly medium and long-term 
investment -- is seriously inadequate. Historical experience 
shows maintenance of a between 2.5:1 and a 3:1 ratio between the 
speed of industrial and agricultural growth to be about right. 
The present state of affairs can go on for a short period, but 
if it continues, the present fairly balanced supply of 
agricultural products will be replaced by a shortage of supply. 
If that happens, agriculture cannot be supported, and the whole 
national economy will once again sink into a vicious cycle 
requiring major readjustments. Third, rural regional development 
is unbalanced. The gap between the central and western parts of 
the country and the developed areas of the east coast has 
widened. A look at the overall rural economy shows a gross 
social output value ratio among rural villages in the east, 
central, and western parts of the country to have widened from 
the 1:.67:.3 of 1980 to 1:.44:.22 in 1991. Central and western 
China have 36 and 23 percent respectively of the country's 
population, but their rural social gross output value amounts to 
only 25 and 12 percent respectively. Fourth, rural surplus 
manpower movement pressure has increased. Statistics show a 
surplus rural manpower of approximately 120 million in these 
areas of the country. Because of the high population base 
figures, rural manpower will reach a respective 490 million and 
540 million by 1995 and 2000. The average annual manpower 
increase will be more than 13 million. If 5 million members of 
the rural work force move to the nonagricultural sector each 
year for the next 15 years, by the year 2000, a newly added 
surplus manpower numbering 64 million will remain in the rural 
villages. When this is added to the existing surplus manpower of 
approximately 120 million, total surplus rural manpower will be 
close to 200 million people. How to find opportunities for such 
a huge rural surplus rural manpower will be a thorny problem 
that will dog us for a long time to come. 
  In short, we must take a comprehensive point of view, a 
dialectical point of view, and a realistic point of view about 
the situation in agriculture and the rural economy. We must not 
overestimate the overall production capacity of agriculture just 
because of the increase in agricultural products for several 
years running. We must not overestimate the prosperity of the 
peasants simply because their standard of living has improved 
considerably. We cannot be blindly optimistic about the rural 
situation just because great achievements have been scored in 
rural reform. Nor should we be negative and pessimistic. We must 
realize the tremendous potential and the favorable conditions 
for sustained development of agriculture, and we must realize 
that work in agriculture and the rural villages faces quite a 
few new circumstances and new problems. There is potential, 
opportunity, and hope for development of the rural economy, and 
there are also contradictions, difficulties, and dangers. 
  Since 1992, the State Council has inaugurated a series 
of policy measures aimed at buttressing agriculture and 
protecting the peasants' interests. How well are these policies 
being implemented? 
  The series of agricultural policies that the State Council 
inaugurated were welcomed by the broad masses of peasants. 
Governments and departments concerned at all levels devoted 
major efforts to implementing these policies, and implementation 
of these policies played a major role in stabilizing agriculture 
and protecting the enthusiasm of the peasants. For various 
reasons, however, results from various jurisdictions 
implementation of policies have varied somewhat from the Central 
Committee's expected goals. Take the issuance of the "two 
monies," for example, the main problems with which were late 
issuance and a low rate for getting the money to households. The 
policy did not play its intended role. Take also implementation 
of the policy of a floor price for peasant grain sales and a 
ceiling price for peasant means of production purchases about 
which every jurisdiction reported problems. One complaint was 
that the standard used in setting the floor price of grain was 
too low; thus, it afforded the peasants hardly any protection. 
The second complaint was that since Central Committee policy 
provisions protected only fixed procurement and grain slated for 
storage, jurisdictions were uncertain as to whether the flor 
price also applied to negotiated price grain. Third, the ceiling 
price for agricultural means of production was subject to 
change. In implementation, the ceiling price might even become 
the floor price for the means of production. Implementation of 
the grain and cotton "three links" materials price reform 
additional price policy brought little real benefit for the 
peasants. The way that summer grain and oil procurement funds 
were handled meant that money was largely at hand in most places 
for the procurement of state fixed procurement grain and oil, 
and grain slated for storage, but in most places no arrangements 
were made or money was not available for the procurement of 
negotiated price grain and oil. In order to avoid issuing IOUs 
for procurement, some places refused to buy. This meant that at 
the state grain production and marketing meetings held to place 
orders, and contracts for the allocation of grain among 
provinces were also hard to implement completely. Every 
jurisdiction also paid extraordinarily close attention to 
implementation of the policy of lightening the peasants burdens, 
but since the peasants burdens issue has such broad 
ramifications and is so complex, true implementation of the 
policy is very difficult, and the task is extremely daunting. 
  For a long time in China, lip service has been paid to 
agriculture but little action taken. All sorts of policies 
emphasizing agriculture have frequently been very difficult to 
put into practice, so much so that many people refer to 
agriculture as "slogan agriculture." This should make people 
think long and hard. What do you think are the main reasons for 
the "slogan agriculture" problem in China? 
  There are rather profound and complex reasons for the rise 
of 
the "slogan agriculture" problem. Historically, when neither 
agriculture nor light industry was fully developed following 
founding of the People's Republic, and per capita national 
income was very low, we relied on the large size of the country 
and the role of the planned economic system. We used the 
exchange at unequal value of industrial wares for agricultural 
products to take money directly from the agricultural sector, 
giving priority to the development of heavy industry. This was 
completely necessary given the special historical circumstances 
of the time. However, despite no practical difficulties for a 
long time, we have not changed our development strategy in a 
timely fashion. On the contrary, in order to ensure long-term 
implementation of this strategy, the state has adopted a series 
of mandatory policies for the separation of industry and 
agriculture, and for separating cities from the countryside. 
Large amounts of money have been extracted from the rural 
villages. At the same time, rural manpower has been confined to 
rural villages and shackled to the land. The result is serious 
imbalance between the development of industry and agriculture 
and between the development of cities and the countryside. This 
has led, in turn, to the formation of traditional agriculture in 
China, a dualistic economic structure in which rural villages 
and modern industry and cities coexist, and a bifurcated social 
structure. This is an important reasons why development of 
China's agriculture has been in a stagnant and backward state 
for a fairly long time since founding of the people's republic. 
The policy environment that emphasizes heavy industry while 
slighting agriculture, and emphasizes the cities while slighting 
the countryside has not been fundamentally changed today. It 
continues to hamper seriously the development of China's 
agriculture and its rural economy. 
  The insufficiently developed rural economic system is also a 
basic reason for China's agricultural problems. After 15 years 
of reform, an embryonic rural market economy system has taken 
shape; nevertheless, the rural economic system is very much 
incomplete both at the microeconomic and the macroeconomic 
levels. One of the ways this is expressed is in the 
insufficiently developed rural microeconomic operating system 
and the rural property rights system. Peasant family authority 
to make their own operating decisions is still not as complete 
as it should be. The second way it is expressed is in meshing 
single peasant household small scale production with domestic 
and international markets. At the present time, the main 
operating entities in China's agriculture are the more than 200 
million peasant households that practice family contracting of 
production, each household farming less than 10 mu of land. They 
produce all kinds of farm products on a small scale. They 
specialize but little. However, they face constantly expanding 
markets. Because farm products markets are poorly developed, 
because trading methods are backward, operating rules 
rudimentary, the degree to which the peasants are organized is 
low, and the development of intermediary organizations to link 
peasants with markets lags, it is difficult for the peasants to 
use effectively the information transmittal, and production 
regulation functions that the market mechanism provides. Faced 
with markets, many peasants are frequently at a loss. A third 
way in which the incompleteness of the rural economic system is 
expressed is in the process of making a transition to the market 
economy system. Most of the regulation and control methods that 
the government used in the past, which consisted mostly of 
administrative means, no longer apply; however, no agricultural 
macroeconomic regulation and control system that meets needs for 
the development of a socialist market economy has been 
established as yet. Government lacks sufficiently effective 
macroeconomic regulation and control methods for implementing 
agricultural policies. 
  Subjectively, neglect of agriculture is an important reason 
for China's agricultural problems. The party and the government 
have always devoted extremely close attention to agriculture. 
Nevertheless, in actual practice, driven by the lack of 
separation between government administration and agricultural 
management, and their own interests, some local jurisdictions 
and government agencies have single-mindedly pursued increase in 
the scale of investment in industry and greater output value. 
Manpower and material resources, as well as investment, have 
been too much tilted toward non-agricultural industries. In 
particular, as a result of the consecutive year bumper harvests 
in agriculture of recent years, and the general difficulty 
selling staple farm products, some comrades mistakenly suppose 
that China's agriculture has turned a corner, or they are no 
longer concerned about the overall situation. Influenced by such 
thinking, some places have relaxed leadership of agriculture. 
Today, when the central authorities are calling for stable grain 
and cotton production to increase effective supply, to calm 
peasant sentiment, and to maintain social tranquility in the 
cities and countryside, local jurisdictions are primarily 
concerned with development of the local economy and increasing 
fiscal revenues. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to expect the 
banks, grain agencies, and supply and marketing agencies, which 
combine policy and business functions in a single body, not to 
consider their own interests in carrying out government 
policies. The mixing of government agency interests, the 
interests of business concerns, and government functions has 
produced distortions in the execution of policies. Delay in 
issuing the "two funds," the diversion of funds, and the 
substitution of materials for loans are examples. Some 
grassroots level cadres and peasants complain that "the central 
authorities provide the money; the local government makes an 
effort; the peasants suffer; government agencies gain; and 
everyone is dissatisfied." 
  So what do you see as the way out of China's 
agricultural problems? 
  During the past several years, the Central Committee and the 
State Council have held a series of important meetings on 
agriculture and the rural economy. The Central Committee Rural 
Work Conference, in particular, broke much new ground on rural 
policy. It did much to increase investment in agriculture, and 
this was extremely encouraging to our comrades who are engaged 
in agriculture and rural work. It will, no doubt, play a 
positive role in stirring the zeal of the peasants. If we just 
act in accordance with the plans and policies that the Central 
Committee and the State Council prescribe, firmly implement 
them, do a solid job, and wholeheartedly do real deeds for the 
peasants, there will be great hope for development of China's 
rural economy. Specifically, this means using the 
intensification of reform, expansion of deregulation, 
optimization of the structure, and increasing investment to 
solve fundamentally the various deep-seated inconsistencies and 
problems faced in the development of China's agriculture. For 
starters, we must first fundamentally change the longstanding 
dualistic economic structure and bifurcated social structure 
that emphasizes industry while slighting agriculture, and that 
emphasizes the cities while slighting the countryside. We must 
establish a development strategy for integrated development of 
industry and agriculture, the cities and the countryside. Right 
now, we must intensify macroeconomic regulation and control, to 
hold the scale of social investment and the speed of industrial 
growth within the limits that agriculture can bear. In addition, 
we must enhance the basic position of agriculture in the course 
of increasing macroeconomic regulation. We must also accelerate 
the movement elsewhere of surplus rural manpower. This is a 
major problem of strategic and over-arching importance in the 
future development of China's national economy. Small cities and 
towns must permit the peasants freely to enter and leave jobs in 
industry or commerce. County seat city, market town, and small 
city policies permitting peasant entry must be broadened. Doing 
this requires rapid reform of the household registration, labor 
employment, and social security systems, actively exploring new 
population control measures that are in keeping with needs of a 
market economy. 
  Second, further intensification of a rural microeconomic 
operating system, rural ownership rights system, rural commodity 
circulation system, and government macroeconomic regulation and 
control system reform is needed to meet the reform goals that 
the 14th Party Congress set for the socialist market economy in 
order to hasten the establishment and perfection of the rural 
economy's operating mechanism and control system based on the 
market mechanism. 
  First the output-related household contract responsibility 
system and the two tier operating system have become basic 
systems in China's rural economy. They should be stabilized for 
the long term. In order to encourage the peasants to increase 
their investment in the land, the farmland contracting period 
should be lengthened to permit farming rights on land to be 
passed from one person to another for payment according to law. 
The already formed land contracting relationships should not be 
changed capriciously. In townships and villages having developed 
non-agricultural industries where an overwhelming majority of 
the work force has already left the land, subject to approval of 
the masses, methods such as sub-contracting, transfer of 
contracts, and services in partnership may be employed to obtain 
various kinds of economies of scale. Farming that offers the 
economies of scale must be practiced in places where conditions 
warrant; the wishes of the peasants must be obeyed; and caution 
employed in action. In no case may there compulsion and 
commandism be used. For most places today, the most important 
matter in perfecting the rural microeconomic operating system is 
to provide the peasants with better services before, during, and 
after production by improving the socialized service system for 
agriculture. In particular, processing, and commodity 
transportation and sales services are needed. Proper guidance 
should be given in this regard that leads gradually to 
family-based farming on a proper scale. 
  Second the stabilization and perfection of the microeconomic 
system in agriculture should be used as the basis for exploring 
actively reform of the rural property rights system. Currently, 
quite a few jurisdictions practice the dividing up among 
households of shares in collectively held assets. This 
effectively handles the problem of maintaining collective 
ownership of the means of production while also getting around 
the difficulty of peasant households having no innate connection 
with collectively held assets. It is an extremely beneficial 
test. The joint stock cooperation system is currently being 
developed very well in every jurisdiction. For the country as a 
whole, it is still in the exploratory stage. It must developed 
in a fairly standardized direction whether formed after the 
former township and village collective enterprises convert to 
some other form, whether its is formed by individual peasants in 
partnership, or whether it is formed through lateral share 
participation among various legal entities. The raising of 
capital, financing, and organization of the elements of 
production must be improved and, more importantly, the important 
goal of clearly defining equity rights and transforming 
enterprises operating mechanisms must be realized. The goal of 
rural land equity rights system reform is to use clear 
affirmation of ownership rights for collective land as a basis 
for encouraging the transfer for compensation of land 
contracting rights, thereby fostering markets for the 
circulation of land use rights. 
  Third is greater reform of the farm products circulation 
system to guide the smooth entry into the market of peasants and 
agriculture. Deregulation of grain and edible oil prices is not 
yet complete; we must press ahead with further deregulation. 
Conditions must also be created for the gradual deregulation of 
cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and silkworm cocoon prices, 
procurement, and marketing. In addition, government can exercise 
regulation and control that reduces market fluctuations by 
establishing a reserve system and a price regulation system. A 
large country like China with a population of 1.1 billion will 
have to maintain the procurement of a certain amount of 
important farm products such as grain. However, procurement 
prices must be set equitably on the basis of the laws of value, 
and with reference to farm product supply and demand, production 
costs, and price ratios. In addition, all other farm products 
should be completely deregulated and be bought and sold freely. 
In order to stabilize the relationship between procurement and 
marketing, it is suggested that production and marketing of 
freely bought and sold products be linked, procurement and 
marketing contracts signed. 
  Now that farm product prices and procurement and marketing 
are being gradually deregulated, how to organize scattered, 
small peasant producers for orderly entry into markets is an 
extremely important question. In foreign countries, the 
formation of cooperatives has been an effective answer. During 
the 1950s, China also set up supply and marketing cooperatives 
and credit cooperatives. However, for reasons known to all, 
these cooperatives ended up being "government run." Since 
reform, the flexibility in operation of these cooperatives has 
improved greatly; however, they still lack a mass character 
organizationally, and a democratic character administratively. 
While persisting in reform of both supply and marketing 
cooperatives and credit cooperatives, we should emphasize the 
nurture and development of peasant cooperative organizations 
such as various kinds of vocational associations, and operating 
organizations that combine farming, breeding, and processing; 
production, supply, and marketing; and trade, industry, and 
agriculture. 
  Intensification of rural commodity circulation system reform 
requires the further building of a market mechanism. If one sees 
price deregulation as a quick variable [kuai bianliang] in 
policy, then the building of markets is a slow variable [man 
bianliang]. Without markets, fluctuations in production will 
intensify. Therefore, continued development of all kinds of 
country fair markets and specialized markets is necessary. 
Specifically, major efforts should be made to develop wholesale 
markets, and to foster futures markets to form a farm products 
marketing system based on country fair markets in which 
wholesale markets serve as the hub and futures markets play a 
vanguard role. At the same time, close attention must be given 
to various kinds of production element markets. At the present 
time, special emphasis should be placed on the development of 
manpower, financial, and information markets. 
  Fourth is greater government macroeconomic regulation and 
control for the building and perfection of a social security 
system in agriculture. In a market economy, as a basic industry 
and as a weak industry, agriculture requires strong government 
regulation and control, support and protection. Much work must 
be done in this regard, but mostly in the following four areas: 
1) Study and formulation of a development strategy. Government's 
administration and control of agriculture must consist primarily 
of administrative means of control transformed into close study 
of a medium and long-term development strategy for agriculture 
and the rural economy, and the drawing up of implementation 
plans; study of the formulation of an industrial policy; 
organization and coordination of the building of major 
agricultural base facilities and agricultural product bases that 
cut across jurisdictional lines, including management of 
investment; issuance of prices for leading farm products and 
market information; and directing overall balance between supply 
and demand for farm products. 2) Use of fiscal subsidies. In a 
market economy, government support for and protection of 
agriculture is expressed mostly through fiscal subsidies. Every 
country in the world subsidizes agriculture to some extent. 
Formerly, the national treasury provided very few direct 
subsidies to agriculture, most of which were applied to the 
commodity circulation realm and to consumers. A change will have 
to be made to mostly subsidize agricultural production and 
industries that serve agriculture. 3) Use of price supports. 
When government uses support prices for the procurement of 
staple farm products such as grain, the support price must be 
set on the principle of production costs plus a reasonable 
profit. When the market price is lower than the floor price, 
government must purchase at the floor price. Over the long term, 
the state must institute support prices in agriculture, set up a 
risk fund, including a production risk fund, a price risk fund, 
and a reserves regulation fund. 4) Perfection of the major farm 
products special reserve system. Government must set a 
reasonable size reserve, and gradually separate special 
government reserves from commercial stocks. 5) Support for the 
development of socialized service organizations for the spread 
of agricultural technology. Service agencies for the spread of 
technology such as farm technology, farm mechanization, animal 
husbandry and veterinary medicine, aquatic products, forestry, 
and water conservancy technologies are government institutions 
at the grassroots level. To a very large extent, they are like a 
social benefit institution. They provide major backstopping for 
the provision of socialized services to agriculture. If science 
and technology are to play to the full a decisive role in the 
development of agriculture, close attention must be given to 
agricultural education, to scientific research, and to the 
spread of technology. In a market economy, government fiscal 
support is the key to scientific research in agriculture, and to 
the survival and development of agencies that spread technology. 
Right now, the spirit of the "Agricultural Technology Promotion 
Law," and documents about stabilization of agricultural sector 
institutions and teams issued by "the five ministries and one 
commission" must be strictly enforced. The practice of using 
reduction of fiscal burdens as a pretext for cutting 
agricultural sector institutions operating expenses, or even to 
"divest" or "wean" them must be resolutely halted. Continuity in 
agricultural sector institutions and agricultural technology 
promotion teams must be increased, and necessary fiscal support 
provided for the development of endeavors such as agricultural 
science and technology research and the spread of technology. 
Making structure reforms should begin from what benefits the 
development of agriculture. Problems with the subordination of 
the "five stations" at the grassroots level of agriculture must 
be solved, all jurisdictions suiting general methods to specific 
circumstances and not acting with "arbitrary uniformity." In 
addition, science and technology at the grassroots level must be 
improved, the study of applied technology spread, and the 
storehouse of science and technology increased, The storehouse 
of high and new technology for "high yield, premium quality, and 
high return" agriculture, and for the prevention and control of 
livestock diseases and insect pests, in particular, must be 
increased to enable science and technology to make agriculture 
prosper. 
  Third, once grain and cotton production have been 
stabilized, 
the rural industrial structure should be boldly readjusted as 
market demand requires. In adjusting the kinds of grain crops, 
more wheat and corn, which are in short supply, as well as 
readily marketable medium and premium quality rice should be 
grown. In the farming sector, more high economic value raw 
materials for industrial processing should be grown. In the 
overall agricultural sector, animal husbandry, the breeding of 
aquatic products, and forestry and orchards should be better 
developed. In the rural economy, major efforts should be devoted 
to the development of township and town enterprises, 
particularly in the central and western parts of the country. In 
the development of township and town enterprises, a policy of 
"active support, rational planning, correct guidance, and strong 
control" should continue to be employed. At the present time, 
glaring problems requiring solution in the development of 
township and town enterprises are the imbalance in development 
between the eastern and western parts of the country, the 
widespread dispersal over a wide area of such enterprises, and 
their fairly low returns. The first requirement is improvement 
of operating mechanisms, perfection of the contracting system, 
and development of a stock share cooperative system that enable 
the maintenance throughout of a flexible and effective operating 
mechanism. Second is the development of small industrial zones, 
development of small industrial zones powering the construction 
of small cities and towns, which spur, in turn, the development 
of tertiary industries, the conservation of energy, the 
availability of transportation, the lowering of energy 
consumption, and the reduction of pollution, while 
simultaneously soaking up more manpower. Third is the need to 
improve product quality in every way possible, succeeding with 
quality and establishing a firm foothold in the market economy. 
In the course of readjusting and optimizing the rural industrial 
structure, one problem that must be given extremely close 
attention is the need to tilt policies in favor of grain and 
cotton production. Once grain and cotton production in major 
grain and cotton growing areas has been substantially 
stabilized, major efforts should be made to develop secondary 
and tertiary industries to increase regional economic strength. 
  Henceforth the state must concentrate all kinds of 
investment 
in both agriculture and non-agricultural industries in the major 
grain and cotton producing areas. It must also build a number of 
namebrand, special, premium, and new product bases, poultry and 
livestock bases, and livestock feed production bases, as well as 
agricultural and sideline products processing bases in principal 
grain and cotton growing areas. Henceforth, in general, the 
state should no longer increase agricultural sideline product 
processing and production capacity in non-production areas and 
in cities. Agricultural and sideline product processing firms 
already located in cities should also be moved to rural or 
production areas in a planned way. Business concerns and 
production and operating concerns in major grain producing areas 
that meet requirements should be given exporting authority. 
  Fourth is greater investment in agriculture to raise 
agriculture's overall production capacity. The key to improving 
the position of agricultural bases lies in improving the overall 
production capacity of agriculture. In view of the country's 
agricultural development goals by 2000, overall production 
capacity of China's agriculture must be increased. An 
agricultural investment system must be formed in which the state 
plays the leading role that encompasses the state, collectives, 
and individual peasants. In accordance with the provisions of 
the "Agriculture Law," the national treasury must annually 
invest in agriculture an amount that is higher than the increase 
in regular national fiscal revenues. Capital construction 
investment in agriculture covered by state plan and within the 
national budget, and investment in industries that serve 
agriculture should be increased year by year to increase the 
disbursement of funds for the capital construction of 
agriculture as a percentage of all investment in capital 
construction within the national budget. Macroeconomic control 
of investment in agriculture outside of budget should be 
improved for good management and use of development funds and 
other special purpose funds for agriculture. The increase in 
agricultural loans should be slightly higher than the increase 
in bank loans nationwide, and the percentage of loans for policy 
purposes, such as medium and long-term low interest loans for 
agriculture should be increased. 
  Raising the overall production capacity of agriculture means 
putting energies into the building of grain, cotton, edible oil, 
and sugar production bases. While paying attention to the 
building of the old bases, attention should be given to a second 
group of commodity bases during the Eighth 5-Year Plan, the 
overall production capacity of the country's commodity grain 
base counties account for half the country's commodity grain. In 
addition, a number of premium quality cotton bases, and a number 
of sugar crop production bases should be newly built. 
  Comprehensive development of agriculture should be 
continued. 
Comprehensive development of agriculture has been a major 
measure for strengthening agriculture pursued since 1988. 
Central government investment, local government matching funds, 
public fund raising, and special purpose agricultural loans for 
this purpose total more than 5 billion yuan each year. The 
development encompasses more than 900 counties and some state 
farms throughout the country. Development during the past 
several years has increased the production capacity of major 
agricultural products, including more than 20 billion jin of 
grain and more than 7 million dan of cotton. The comprehensive 
development of agriculture must be conducted with greater 
intensity in future, emphasis given to the improvement of 
intermediate and low yield fields and cultivated land 
reclamation, protection of agricultural resources, improvement 
of the ecological environment, and the development of ecological 
agriculture. 
  Finally is the lightening of peasant burdens, increasing 
peasant income, and protecting peasant rights and interests. In 
the final analysis, agricultural problems are peasant problems. 
"When the peasants are poor, agriculture does not prosper." 
Peasant income has increased only slowing in recent years. Not 
only has this directly affected investment in agriculture 
adversely and seriously dampened peasant interest in farming, 
but it has also seriously limited overall national economic 
growth. If the goal of a comfortably well-off standard of living 
by the end of the present century is to be reached, peasant per 
capita net annual income will have to rise more than 5.7 
percent. The basic goal of China's future agricultural policy 
should be synchronous increase in the supply of agricultural 
products and peasant income. Increasing peasant income requires, 
first, the broadening of sources of income, meaning development 
of the rural economy. Second is checking the loss of peasant 
income, meaning reducing peasant burdens. Reduction of peasant 
burdens must be a task that is conducted unflaggingly over a 
long period, the peasants' burdens gradually being standardized 
and put under the legal system. 
  Thank you very much for the interview.

  [Summary] In 1994 gross output of soybeans in Heilongjiang 
Province could reach 3,790,000 tons; 258,000 tons will be used 
as seed; 736,000 tons will be used for feed; 244,000 tons will 
be used for urban consumption; 111,000 tons will be used by 
industry; and 1,342,000 tons will shipped to other provinces. 
The market price for soybeans is expected to drop to 1.60 yuan 
per kilogram in the spring because the soybean area has 
increased in the north. Soybean demand has decreased in Europe, 
and soybean prices have dropped in international markets. The 
Heilongjiang provincial government has stipulated that no 
soybeans will be shipped to other provinces prior to fulfillment 
of contract orders.

  [Summary] As of 9 December, national cotton procurement 
totaled 31 million dan. Shandong Province had procured 
2,380,000 dan, a 30 percent decrease from the same period in 
1992. Gross output of cotton in Shandong will be only 5,430,000 
dan, and procurement 4,250,000 dan. Of the 61 state-owned large 
and medium-sized textile enterprises in Shandong, 12 have not 
been alloted cotton. As of 6 December, 49 enterprises had 
received 186,000 dan, fulfilling 13.8 percent of the plan. By 
year end 50 percent of the enterprises will have to stop 
production. Textile exports account for one-third of foreign 
exchange earned in Shandong, once exports decline it will be 
hard to make up the loss.

<F P=106> [Article by Dong Fangse (2639 2455 5331): "Zhou Hong Signs </F>
First Deal as `Indentured' Writer, Xinwen Publishing Office To 
Mop Up Publishing's Strange Births"] 
  [Text] China's publishing circles, in the midst of a sales 
boom, are rapidly moving towards marketization. 
<H5>  Publishing Houses Eye Throwing Themselves Into the Market </H5>
  In the past, mainland publishing houses only put out books 
in 
accordance with the plan, not paying attention to market 
attitudes and the interests of readers, with the result that 
after new books were published, nobody was interested in them, 
warehouses were overstocked, and readers also did not buy books 
that they really needed. Now, a publishing house's profits are 
linked with its books sales volume, and as many publishing 
houses are starting to eye throwing themselves into the market, 
great changes are brewing for China's publishing houses. 
<H5>  Best Selling Books in 1993 </H5>
  According to a recent survey, the best selling books on the 
mainland fall primarily into the following categories: 
  1. Steady selling trend for well known foreign 
best-sellers. 
  In 1993, various bookstores' stocks of well known foreign 
best-sellers were generally low, while sales of stock items had 
not yet fallen. Hangzhou City bookstores in the first half of 
the year saw a 24 percent increase in this aspect of their sales 
compared to a similar period in 1992. In addition, the majority 
of well-known foreign works come in two types, those that 
contain little that is Chinese in essence, and those editions 
that are popularized and simplified. The selling trends for 
these two types of editions are impressive, with the latter a 
result of their low cost and the fact that they are favored by 
college students and working class people. 
<H5>  Five Great Works by the "Shaanxi Army's Eastern Expedition" </H5>
  Among the modern popular novels, the novels of people 
like Su Tong [5685 4547], and Liu Zhenyun [0491 7201 0061] are 
selling comparatively well. Shaanxi author Jia Pingao's [6328 
1627 0425] novel Ruined Capital [Feidu], 
Chen Zhongshi's [7115 1813 1395] novel White Deer 
Country [Bailu Yuan] and the novels Ardent 
Destiny [Reai Mingyun], The Last Hun 
[Zuihou Yige Xiongnu], and Eight Li of Kindness 
and Hatred [Bali Qingchou] by several other 
authors from Shaanxi Province, constitute the Five Great Works 
by the "Shaanxi Army Eastern Expedition," which all at the same 
time have won initial success in the Chinese literary world. Jia 
Pingao's novel Ruined Capital has both been called a 
"modern day Jin Pingmei," and received attention at 
home and abroad, and allegedly the reprintings of the book now 
exceed 500 thousand copies. 
  2. Acrobatic opera novels are making a comeback. 
  While acrobatic opera novels have generated a greatly 
expanded group of readers, many people view this type of book as 
addictive; particularly, the acrobatic opera novels 
Jinyong and Gulong, which to this day 
remain best-sellers at local newsstands. 
  3. On the spot business literature and financial and 
economic type popular novels are popular. 
  For example, the twenty odd novels of the Hong Kong 
female writer Liang Fengyi [2733 7685 0308] such as 
Nightmares of the Rich [Haomen Jingmeng] 
and Hua Kuijie are selling very well. In China, where 
the number of readers has mushroomed, there are few readers who 
still dislike this type of book. 
  4. Literature about foreign lands is in great demand. 
  Following in the path of such novels as A Beijinger 
in New York, and A Chinese Woman in Manhattan, 
the novel Luqia: A Beijing Girl in New York is 
selling well. In addition, the books of a number of Taiwan and 
Hong Kong authors such as Xi Murong [1598 1970 5554], San Mao 
[0005 3029], and Qiong Yao [8825 3852] have already become big 
sellers. 
  5. Biographies of famous persons are still very popular. 
  Biographies of famous persons, such as Historical 
Selections of Mao Zedong, At the Wedding of Chiang 
Kai-shek, The Biography of Zhou Enlai, and 
My Father, Deng Xiaoping are all in great demand. A 
number of biographies of famous foreigners, such as Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Charles De Gaulle are also 
unable to keep up with demand. 
  6. Specialized books are more and more in demand. 
  There is a tremendous amount of demand for this type of 
book, and as long as the contents are practical, the quality is 
high, and the editing is not disorderly, they will sell very 
well indeed. For example, books of an economic genre such as 
The Complete Book of World Trade, Dictionary of 
Accounting, Real Estate Investment, A 
Guidebook for Brokers; medical type books such as 
Color Atlas of Chinese Medicinal Herbs; books on 
historical relics such as Illustrated Dictionary of 
Chinese Bronze Mirrors, and scientific type books such as 
An English-Chinese Scientific and Technical 
Dictionary. Though these books are high-priced, because of 
their practical use, they are also books that specialists must 
be equipped with, hence they are very much in demand. 
  7. Daily living type books and various types of juvenile 
and children's reading material. 
  When it comes to daily living type books such as A 
Handbook of Family Medicine, Use and Maintenance of 
Household Electrical Appliances, and various types of 
cookbooks, books on cosmetics, or weaving, though there appears 
to be much duplication in the published items, each edition 
seems to be selling quite well. Various types of books for 
juveniles and children compiled to develop the intellect and 
increase knowledge are also selling very well. 
<H3>  New Symbols of Striding Towards the Market: Authors Signing 
Agreements and Competitively Priced Manuscripts </H3>
  Authors signing agreements and competitively priced 
manuscripts are two to the most recent signs that the mainland 
publishing world is striding towards the market. 
  Publishing a good book requires having a good manuscript, 
yet over the past several years the many of the payments for 
books for authors on the mainland have been from 30 yuan per 
thousand characters, to 50 yuan per thousand, with the highest 
figures reaching around 100 yuan. In the current situation, when 
the economy is developing so rapidly, levels of consumption are 
extremely high, and these types of fees for books written have 
made it very difficult to attract writers. Some writers, to make 
ends meet, have had no choice but to abandon the pen and go into 
business. For some period of time, writers went overseas, and 
this has resulted in a lack of good manuscripts, hence salacious 
and low-grade works have flooded the market. 
  Without a good source of manuscripts, publishing houses 
have been very hard pressed. Some publishing units have broken 
through traditional manuscript standards, and adopted an 
approach calling for superior prices paid for superior 
manuscripts, vying for a good draft over a period of time, and 
capturing the market. In October of 1993, the Shenzhen Youth 
Magazine House and the Guangdong Province Periodical Commercial 
Development Company sponsored a public competition for 
outstanding manuscripts, an activity genuinely directed towards 
entering into market competition for the manuscripts of mainland 
authors. 
  On October 28, 1993, the mainland's first time ever 
outstanding manuscript competition was launched in Shenzhen. 
There were more than 30 manuscripts entered, and among them were 
some 14 on-the-spot type literary works, occupying an 
overwhelmingly dominant position. In addition, there were also 
novels, movie scripts, examples of prose, essays, academic 
works, specialized papers, and popular historical material. Some 
well known writers such as Zhang Xianliang [1728 6343 0081] 
participated in the competition, though a large number were up 
and coming young writers. 
  The China Pacific Insurance Company's Shenzhen Branch 
supplied guaranteed insurance for the guaranteed minimum price 
of the competitively priced manuscripts. The units participating 
in the competition included numerous domestic and foreign 
publishing, television, and radio organizations and 
entrepreneurs. The very first to strike a deal was author Shi 
Tiesheng's [0670 6993 3932] short story "Others" [Bieren] and 
the young theorist Wang Donghua's [3769 2639 5478] social 
science treatise "The New Academics" [Xin Daxueren] which were 
bought by the Shenzhen Airport Lounge Company, Ltd. for 8000 
yuan and 80,000 respectively. One privately run enterprise head 
offered an opening price of 3000 yuan per thousand characters 
and purchased a manuscript by Liu Xiaoqing [0491 2556 1987] 
titled "From Movie Star to Millionairess," and other manuscripts 
also by and large were sold to industrial and commercial 
enterprises. 
  When it comes to competitive pricing of manuscripts, 
mainland authors and publishers have differing views. 
<H3>  Does Putting Literature on the Market Foster an Impulsive 
Spirit in Literary Circles? </H3>
  Peoples' Publishing House head and editor-in-chief Xue 
Dezhen [5641 1795 7201] is rather in agreement with this. He 
states that the price of a manuscript in the final analysis must 
be regulated by the unseen hand of the market. He believes that 
though competitively pricing manuscripts using this method 
meshes with the market, it is an assault on mainland publishing 
circles' traditional approach involving the planned economy and 
administrative fiat, and will be very beneficial for increasing 
the quality of cultural products and promoting a change in the 
thinking of publishing circles. 
  Art critic Ma Ye [7456 0048] thinks that the essential 
significance of the competitive pricing of manuscripts lies in 
the fact that it has made it possible for a market for culture 
to be established in China. Let those men of letters who have 
abandoned literature engage in business return to their own 
heartfelt occupation, and compete in the "ocean of literature." 
He disclosed that the original manuscript of Jia Pingao's new 
work Ruined Capital was bought by the Beijing October 
Art Publishing House for 150 yuan per 1000 characters (the 
printing impression manuscript price was separately calculated), 
and if it the deal had been done using competitive pricing, this 
would have had an altogether different effect on the author, on 
the publishing house, and on the social effect and benefit of 
the work. 
  Some authors express concern and wearied bewilderment 
when it comes to competitive pricing of manuscripts. Six 
writers, including Zhang Jie [1728 3381] and Cong Weixi [0654 
4850 3556], withdrew en masse from the reviewing committee for 
this effort at competitive pricing of manuscripts. Author Liu 
Xinwu [0491 1800 2976] believes that a market for literary 
manuscripts should not be the basic method to solve the problem. 
Literary works, though they possess the properties of a 
commodity, at root also fall into the category of spirit, and 
whether or not putting literature on the market fosters an 
impulsive spirit in literary circles, it gives rise to money 
worship and cultural philistinism. 
  There are also writers who hold that after market 
behavior has played itself out, whether or not this is contrary 
to the initial intention, it pulls down the market for literary 
manuscripts into the vulgar realm of an arena for commodity 
transaction. 
  Confronting the concerns of literary and art circles, one 
figure from the publishing world points out that when it comes 
to literary manuscripts, two mechanisms should be established: 
First, the state should provide protection, and second, things 
should be allowed to move towards the market. 
  It is reported that at the conclusion of this activity 
involving the competitive pricing of manuscripts, the organizing 
committee established a permanent organization in Shenzhen for 
dealing in manuscripts, which will become a collection and 
distribution center for mainland manuscripts. 
<H5>  Zhou Hong, the First "Indentured" Chinese Writer? </H5>
  In fact, at the same time as the Shenzhen manuscript 
competitive pricing market was closing, the China Youth 
Publishing House and the author Zhou Hong [0719 3163] signed an 
agreement which has caused no small amount of rumblings within 
publishing circles on the mainland. Some people believe that 
Zhou is in fact the mainland's first "indentured" writer, 
because the contract stipulates that for the next three years, 
Zhou must fulfill obligations for writing books in accordance 
with the overall plan of the China Youth Publishing House. If 
the publishing house does not agree with a selected topic, Zhou 
has no right to write about it. One older writer commented: "For 
the writer, the most important thing is that when he writes, he 
must have freedom of mind, and a distinctive individuality; if 
he is only working in accordance with another's intentions, what 
will he be able to produce?" 
  But there are also those who hold that because the 
publishing house handles everything, the writer has no fear 
problems back home, and can write while setting his or her mind 
at rest. 
<H3>  Changing the Situation of "Read a Manuscript, Do Not Worry, 
Return the Manuscript, Do Not Pay Money, Agree on Eating from 
the Common Pot, Printing Takes Three and a Half Years" </H3>
  The China Youth Publishing House Director Hu Shouwen [5170 
1343 2429] states that they "purchased" Zhou Hong with the 
primary intention of upsetting the balance of the publishing 
houses still under the old system. Because its interests are 
bound together with those of the writer, the publishing house 
will change the past cycle and rhythm of the type "read a 
manuscript, do not worry, return the manuscript, do not pay 
money for it, make an agreement on eating from the common pot, 
print after three and a half years," and stimulate reform. He 
comments that this publishing house will by stages and in groups 
"purchase" writers, hoping to have a plan to promote the 
mainland's own writers who are in great demand, such as San Mao, 
Qiong Yao, and Jin Yong, and guide and capture over the long 
term the market for popular literature that the old line 
publishing houses have felt beneath their notice. 
  Zhou Hong's collection A Warning to the Chinese 
People was the most popular and in demand set of books in 
China for the first half of 1993. As for his status as 
"indentured," Zhou says that this stems initially from the need 
to subsist, but he hopes that other writers do not walk this 
path, "because literature after all requires a group of people 
who resolutely refuse to bend to the popular will." 
<H3>  Centers for Buying and Selling Book Numbers: A Strange Birth 
From Mainland's Publishing Circles </H3>
  According to international practice, to issue a book it 
must have a number, and the "Chinese Standard Book Numbers" are 
the symbol of the right to publish that the government gives to 
publishing houses. They are issued by the China ISBN Center free 
of charge and supplied to publishing houses for their use. The 
buying and selling of book numbers happens when a publishing 
house takes a "Chinese Standard Book Number" subordinate to that 
house and sells it to a non-publishing unit or another 
publishing house. This in essence is an illegal publishing 
activity. 
  The buying and selling of book numbers had already 
emerged in China in 1984, and in recent years has become more 
and more prevalent. According to relevant administrative 
department statistics, book numbers sold by publishing units 
over the course of a year constitute some 10 percent of the 
total books published in the mainland. Figures from the Xinhua 
Book Stores and departments that publish scientific research 
believe that the real number is higher than this. 
  The factors that have generated this buying and selling 
of book numbers have two primary aspects: First, publishing 
house editors have little power, publishing funds are seriously 
inadequate, and houses have a book number but are often 
powerless to publish a book; second, a "second channel" of 
distribution is rapidly developing, and some portion of the 
newly formed collective, and individually owned book businesses, 
are one by one switching from retail to wholesale, and from 
wholesale gradually getting involved in publishing, hence book 
numbers something that are in high demand among these 
businesses. Some publishing houses, to solve the issue of 
funding, will take their own book numbers and sell them for 
several thousand yuan up to 10,000 yuan to collective and 
individually owned book businesses, and these businesses, as 
long as they pay around a 10,000 yuan "management fee," can hope 
to turn a generous profit of from 10-fold to several tens-fold. 
This is virtually becoming a market in the buying and selling of 
book numbers. 
  Because the buying and selling of book numbers is 
lucrative, more and more non-publishing units and individuals 
are becoming interested. Those buying and selling book numbers 
have gone from the original collective and individually owned 
book businesses, government units, and individual writers, and 
expanded to nearly all levels of society, including bookstores, 
printing plants, and educational institutions. 
<H5>  "Brokers of Culture" Emerge In Accordance With the Times </H5>
  The trading in book numbers has given rise in publishing 
circles two a situation that has caused concern to many: A group 
of "brokers of culture," who reap unfair profits through selling 
book numbers, has emerged in accordance with the times; this 
group panders to the market and panders to vulgar popular taste 
and vulgar literary style books and periodicals. According to a 
survey, of the pornographic and salacious books and those with 
"political problems," from 80 to 90 percent had book numbers 
that were purchased. 
  In addition, the buying and selling of book numbers 
disrupts the normal order of publishing house administration, 
books are manufactured in a rough and slipshod manner, quality 
is seriously reduced, and it reduces the number of planned books 
that a publishing house can produce, hindering the publishing of 
good books and literary works. 
  The China Xinwen Publishing Office has issued repeated 
injunctions prohibiting the buying and selling of book numbers. 
From 1989 to 1990, dozens of publishing units had their house 
number revoked because of buying and selling of book numbers. In 
September of 1993, as the whole society was engaged in an 
anticorruption initiative, mainland publishing circles again 
proposed the "resolute rooting out of the corrupt behavior of 
buying and selling book numbers." But whether or not this 
practice, with its strange origin, can really be eliminated on 
the mainland will await conscientious implementation by 
publishing circles and strict supervision by every level of 
society. 
<H5>  The Fraud of "Foreign Book Numbers" </H5>
  When the "Chinese Standard Book Numbers" were a hot 
topic, some foreign publishing organizations also looked at 
mainland practice, using pleasing phrases such as "to assist 
mainland publishing houses in resolving funding difficulties," 
and "to assist mainland authors in giving expression to their 
intellectual achievements." They also peddled so-called 
"international book numbers," and "Hong Kong book numbers," and 
reaped unfair profits from this. 
  Most of those engaged in this sort of activity were 
figures who in recent years have left the mainland to live in 
Hong Kong. They register in Hong Kong a fictitious local 
publishing house, and because they have no way to publish and 
issue hot-selling books, they use differences between the 
mainland and Hong Kong's local publishing system, and take 
worthless local Hong Kong book numbers to the mainland to sell 
at a high profit. They normally go through two channels: The 
first is to send a large number of book number purchase order 
lists to relevant departments and writers; the second is to 
engage in selling book numbers for excessive profit through 
representatives on the mainland. 
  The China Xinwen Publishing Administration Department has 
taken measures to curb profiteering in "international numbers." 
According to a public announcement by Chinese authorities: There 
are around 10 Hong Kong publishing organizations engaging in 
illegal buying and selling of book numbers in China, including 
such outfits as the Tianma Book Company, Ltd. and the South 
Pacific Publishing House. 
  Fraud involving "foreign book numbers" has meant that 
many mainland authors who have been successful for many years 
only to have their works exchanged as "illegal publications," 
and there are even some people who, wanting to publish a book, 
buy a book number, and then borrow money, sustaining 
irreplaceable losses. Disseminated news stories have warned 
mainland writers "to be careful and protect against being 
duped," while the China Xinwen Publishing Office has also issued 
to various locales "Notification Relating to Prohibition of Sale 
of Hong Kong and Taiwan Book Numbers on the Mainland." It is 
reported that at present activity in illegally profiteering in 
"international book numbers" has already been somewhat curtailed. 
<H3>  "Sweeping Up Pornography" and "Cracking Down on Illegal 
Publishing" </H3>
  Since July 1987 when the mainland first launched an 
extensive "anti- pornography" campaign, its seems that every 
year an anti-pornography or "attack illegal publications" 
campaign is undertaken. However, because management of the 
publications market is chaotic, printing houses put profit 
making first and pornographic publications have the attraction 
of high profits, resulting in the fact that there is an 
incessant wave of pornography, and the creators of pornographic 
materials are constantly changing their appearance and adopting 
new countermeasures. 
  Since early in 1993 an extensive anti-pornography 
campaign has been underway, and this has forced illegal 
smuggling activity around various coastal locales to be more and 
more underground and secretive. Many areas have formed 
"transprovincial" and "transnational" trust type underground 
organizations, which have even been expanding into black market 
operations. 
<H5>  Bookstalls Primarily Hitting "Edge Balls" </H5>
  A large number of bookstalls, meaning the proprietors, 
when offering pornographic materials for sale in the midst of a 
bustling metropolis, adopt the tactic of hitting "the edge 
ball." The front cover titles are brimming with the seduction of 
violence and lewdity, but in reality the contents often stop 
short of this, and they cannot be equated with "pornography." 
For example, "Husbands and Wives Talk About Sex and Love," 
"Robbers of the Flesh in Action," and no small number of picture 
albums of the human body, collections of portraits all have 
extremely seductive cover titles, while the contents cannot be 
considered to have "exceeded the boundaries [of decency]". 
  Early in 1993, the amorous novels of the Qing and Ming 
periods all the rage on the mainland were part of this 
situation. These books to a lessor or greater extent all have 
vigorous men and amorous females, and because they do not 
involve questions of publishing rights, some publishing houses 
reproduce large numbers, and most also attract readers with 
covers that advertise things like "Qing period bawdy novel." 
Sometimes one book will be out in editions from several 
publishing houses. In addition, books related to Jin 
Pingmei such as Jin Pingmei Words and 
Expressions, Fan Jinlian and Li Pinger, and the 
Western Gate Day [Ximen Qin] are also of this ilk. 
  Something that is different from hitting "edge balls" 
occurs in some areas of Guangdong, were some pornographic 
publications under names like "New Wave novels," "Three Level 
novels," "Modern novels," or "selection of best-selling books," 
actually have contests that are really quite obscene. The 
majority of these books draw materials from foreign pornographic 
publications, and rearrange things through piecing together and 
clipping and pasting. Almost every two or three weeks a new set 
of "new wave novels" appears at bookstalls, and among this 
variety of items, the quantity of pornographic material is high, 
a ferocious force, making people surprised that this is 
happening in China. Why local authorities in Guangdong are not 
controlling this is even more strange. 
  In June and July of 1993, relevant departments on the 
mainland again launched an anti-pornography campaign. In Beijing 
alone there were eight cases that were investigated, with proper 
actions taken against the "production of pornographic materials, 
"trafficking in pornography" and engaging in illegal publishing 
activity. Seven "nests of wholesalers" were ferreted out, more 
than 230,000 items of contraband goods and illegal publications 
were seized, including more than 40 types of obscene 
publications totalling more than 110,000 items; some 3225 
illegal videocassete tapes were seized, as were 12,700 illegal 
audiotapes, and any further rise in the tide of pornography has 
been controlled. The Xinwen Publishing Office again stresses 
that "sweeping up pornography" and "cracking down on illegal 
publications" are important matters related to the basic line, 
and must resolutely be maintained, constantly grasped with no 
letup.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Xiyan: "The Machinery Industry's Problems </F>
in Developing Foreign-Funded Enterprises"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Many problems have emerged in 
the process of developing foreign-funded enterprises in the 
machinery industry, and those problems are harming the healthy 
development of the utilization of foreign capital in the 
machinery industry, and warrant a high degree of attention. 
<H5>  Most Projects Are Small in Scale and Low in Standards </H5>
  The average agreed amount of foreign investment for 
foreign-funded enterprises in the machinery industry is only 
$1.03 million. The amount of funds actually invested is even 
more pitifully small. In the Jiangsu and Anhui region, most 
foreign investment consists of funds invested by Hong Kong and 
Taiwan businesses and processing projects for Japanese 
businesses. In terms of technology, there has been no 
qualitative improvement in enterprises' products. This shows 
that in terms of the average amount of investment for the 
projects, China's machinery industry's utilization of foreign 
capital is characterized by small scale and low standards, and 
that it is necessary to develop joint ventures and cooperation 
with internationally renowned large transnational conglomerates, 
thereby raising standards and achieving upgrades. 
<H5>  Projects Are Not Properly Distributed </H5>
  Basic parts and basic machinery are the weak links of the 
machinery industry, and the improvement of the overall standards 
of the machinery industry depends on the rapid development of 
basic parts and basic machinery. However the basic parts sector 
has utilized only $200 million in foreign direct investment, 
accounting for 4 percent; the average amount of foreign capital 
involved for the projects is only $630,000. Basic machinery 
mainly refers to machine tools. The machine tool sector has 
utilized only less then $300 million in foreign direct 
investment, accounting for 6 percent; the average amount 
utilized for the projects is only $650,000. In the two basic 
sectors, the scale of utilization of foreign capital and the 
average amount of foreign capital utilized for the projects are 
both small, and the technological content of products is low; 
the two basic sectors are far from meeting the demands of the 
overall development of the machinery industry. Therefore it is 
necessary to accelerate the development of the two sectors. 
<H3>  The Problem of Increasing Pressure at Every Level and 
Pursuing Quantity in a One-Sided Manner Is Serious </H3>
  The purpose of developing foreign-funded enterprises is to 
make up for the insufficiency of domestically gathered funds, 
accelerate the optimization of economic structure, accelerate 
resource development, and promote technological progress. 
Nevertheless, some localities seek to increase the number of 
foreign-funded enterprises in a one-sided manner, increasing 
pressure at every level; they have made the quantity of foreign 
capital utilized an item of performance evaluation. As a result, 
in whatever areas foreign businesses have shown interest, there 
will be negotiations on those areas, and projects in those areas 
will be carried out accordingly. Joint ventures are established 
in a blind manner. "Whatever is put into the basket is 
considered vegetable." There is no bargaining with cooperation 
partners, neither is there any strategy or blueprint. Also, 
there is a lack of macro-level guidance. 
<H5>  Pre-project Decision Making Is Ineffective </H5>
  Currently, when making preproject decisions on 
foreign-funded 
enterprises, many localities have failed to form strong teams to 
conduct investigation, study, surveying, and supporting 
analysis, and have instead operated in a perfunctory manner, 
grabbing everything available indiscriminately. The main 
manifestations include: 1) A failure to select cooperation 
partners carefully; 2) a failure to conduct extensive market 
investigations and a tendency to join the action in a hurry, 
resulting in redundant projects; 3) a failure to acquire 
adequate information about foreign businesses' credit status, 
resulting in being defrauded in some cases; and 4) a failure to 
conduct self-evaluation and consider future development in an 
adequate manner. A factory in Wuxi signed the contract on a 
joint venture project with a U.S. company before the assets of 
the Chinese partner had been evaluated. According to later 
evaluations, the assets were worth more than estimated in the 
contract; asset disputes thus ensued, casting a shadow over the 
development of the joint venture. The joint-venture contract on 
a joint-venture project between a factory in Anhui and ABB 
Corporation was signed when agreements on technological 
transfers and on plant, equipment, and land leasing had not been 
entirely worked out; in addition the contract provided that the 
technological-transfer percentage-retention payment should 
amount to 3 percent of net sales. Without an agreement on 
technological transfers, how could there be any 
technological-transfer percentage-retention payment? Is all this 
not very strange? 
<H5>  There Is No Guarantee of Supporting Funds </H5>
  In developing joint ventures, the Chinese partners depend 
almost entirely on loans for funds. Since the middle of last 
year, supporting funds have been in short supply. As a result 
agreements on some new projects on which negotiation has been 
completed cannot be signed according to schedule; projects on 
which agreements have been signed cannot start to be constructed 
or be put into production operation according to schedule; and 
the projects which have been put into operation cannot function 
normally. Consequently, foreign businesses' confidence in 
project success has been lowered, and the rate of delivery of 
agreed investment funds has declined. 
<H3>  Internal, External Management of Foreign-Funded Enterprises 
Is Not Strict </H3>
  1. The property rights of Chinese partners do not have 
actual 
effects, and the responsibility for state assets is not clearly 
located. As the present period is a changing and transition 
period, the rights of local machinery-industry management 
agencies as representatives of state assets are not clearly 
defined. After becoming joint ventures, most enterprises' boards 
of directors contain no officials from government agencies. The 
supervisory agencies' management of enterprises is carried out 
mainly through the boards of directors, but most directors 
representing the Chinese partners work as employees in the joint 
ventures, and are thus unable to represent the interest of the 
Chinese partners in a satisfactory manner. 
  2. Foreign partners often take advantage of Chinese 
partners' 
weaknesses, such as being unfamiliar with the international 
market situation and lacking purchasing and marketing channels, 
by manipulating prices and fee standards, appropriating 
enterprise profits, and evading taxes, thereby harming the 
interests of the country. 
  3. The system of external management of foreign-funded 
enterprises is not yet characterized by an organic structure, 
and management work is weak. 
<H3>  Quantity, Quality of Trained Personnel Cannot Meet Demands 
of Development </H3>
  1. There is a lack of personnel competent for externally 
oriented economic activities. There are often no suitable people 
who can negotiate with foreign parties. Consequently it has been 
necessary to cope with the matter by using some people who are 
doing other work. Those people do not understand negotiating 
procedures, negotiation techniques, or international practices. 
Whatever the foreign parties say is accepted. All this has 
created a very difficult situation. 
  2. The people who participate in the management of joint 
ventures on the Chinese side are relatively low in quality and 
strong in self interest, and do not act in the interests of the 
country, resulting in damages to the interest of the country. 
For instance, a joint-venture company in Suzhou has five 
directors, three of whom represent the Chinese partner; but one 
Chinese director is siding with the foreign partner. As a 
result, control over the joint-venture company has fallen into 
foreign hands when the Chinese partner has a majority of the 
shares. Secondly, the professional competence is also low. 
Chinese partners' representatives play no effective role in the 
management of joint ventures. Chinese managers of some joint 
ventures lack knowledge about foreign languages, computers, and 
the accounting system, do not grasp the actual business 
situation of the joint ventures, and are thus unable to 
participate in management. 
  3. As the standards of some Chinese technical personnel in 
joint ventures are low, the process of nationalizing production 
has been slow, and it has been difficult to achieve a foreign 
exchange balance. 
<H5>  Information Channels Do Not Function Well </H5>
  China does not yet have a complete information system 
providing enterprises with information about foreign capital. 
This fact has produced large adverse effects on developing 
foreign-funded enterprises. First, Chinese enterprises do not 
have detailed information about large companies in their 
respective industries around the world. If they want to form 
joint ventures, they cannot take the initiative in seeking joint 
venture partners, but can only negotiate with those who have 
come, resulting in a large degree of blindness and a low success 
rate. Second, as they do not know the situation of prices and 
purchasing channels for the equipments needed by the joint 
ventures on the international market, they cannot but let 
foreign partners make profits and harm Chinese interests by 
raising prices at will. Third, Chinese partners do not control 
channels of purchasing raw materials and parts needed by the 
joint ventures or channels of marketing joint venture products 
on the international market. As a consequence, foreign partners 
can import things at high prices and export things at low 
prices, thereby making huge profits in the circulation stage. At 
the same time the joint ventures would be suffering losses in 
terms of what the books show; thus the Chinese partners will 
receive no dividends and the state can collect no taxes.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Ding Genxi: "Ministry of Chemical </F>
Industry Changes Functions, Focuses on Macro Regulation and 
Control, Does a Good Job of Providing Services for Both Ends"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In accordance with the decision 
made by the first session of the 8th National People's Congress, 
the CPC group at the former Ministry of Chemical Industry 
reformed the bureaucratic structure of the former Ministry of 
Chemical Industry in a comprehensive manner. This reform has now 
been basically completed; in terms of the ministerial-level 
bureaucracy, the numbers of department- and bureau-level units 
and division-level units have been reduced from 15 and over 90 
to 12 and over 60 respectively, and the number of functionaries 
has been reduced from 577 to 320. Those office workers and 
department, bureau, and division-level cadres rendered surplus 
have all been placed. The new Ministry of Chemical Industry has 
begun to function in accordance with the new functional 
requirements. 
  The former Ministry of Chemical Industry managed over 6,000 
chemical enterprises and institutions at the county level or 
above in the chemical industry system. The ministry was not only 
responsible for approving chemical projects and allocating 
materials and funds, but also responsible for making production 
plans of enterprises; even plans and arrangements concerning 
enterprises' equipment overhauls were made by the ministry. The 
scope of management was excessive, and management was carried 
out in an overly detailed manner. The new Ministry of Chemical 
Industry will not only manage the previous chemical sector, but 
also manage, in a comprehensive manner, the chemical industry 
which consists of different sectors such as the petrochemical, 
coal chemical, salt chemical, and refined product chemical 
sectors and enterprises of different ownership statuses such as 
foreign-funded chemical enterprises and township chemical 
enterprises. Even since its establishment, it has broken away 
from the traditional views and practices characterized by 
intervention in enterprises' production and business activities, 
and has instead concentrated on macro-level management. For 
instance, the chemical industry production planning conference, 
recently gathered by the Ministry of Chemical Industry, was 
mainly devoted to analyzing the situation of the chemicals 
market next year, inviting the comrades in charge of the 
relevant ministries and commissions to discuss what chemical 
materials provided by the chemical industry their respective 
sectors would need and how much of each material they would 
need, and then making macrolevel production plans for the next 
year on the basis of market demand. The practice, prevalent at 
the previous years' production planning conferences, of haggling 
over plan targets with directors of chemical industry 
departments or bureaus of the localities, resulting in the 
Ministry of Chemical Industry being eventually forced to impose 
plans on its subordinates, was changed. According to a source, 
this year's plan, made by the Ministry of Chemical Industry in 
view of market demand and the actual situation of enterprises, 
was based on the superior's working in concert with its 
subordinates and was deeply welcomed by the localities and 
various quarters. Leading comrades of many localities said that 
this change on the part of the Ministry of Chemical Industry was 
not only conducive to making production in line with demand, but 
also conducive to adjusting the product structure of the 
chemical industry and improving economic efficiency, and that 
thus the change had won profound support from the people and 
enterprises. 
  In the process of transforming the function of government, 
the Ministry of Chemical Industry has given particular emphasis 
to providing services for the "two ends," providing services 
both for the localities and enterprises and for foreign 
businesses. Since its establishment, the new Ministry of 
Chemical Industry has dispatched investigation groups to conduct 
investigation at the grass roots on many occasions, and has also 
held symposiums of various kinds so as to hear enterprises' 
appeals and demands and to keep enterprises informed, thereby 
helping enterprises resolve a series of practical problems in 
development. With the rapid development of our national economy, 
some large chemical enterprises abroad have been shifting their 
attention to China in terms of their investment plans. In view 
of this development, the Ministry of Chemical Industry informed 
enterprises of the said situation in a timely manner, and 
informed foreign businesses of the state of development of 
chemical industry across China, thereby making the two sides 
very happy. Since the beginning of this year, the Ministry of 
Chemical Industry has signed comprehensive cooperation 
agreements with 12 large chemical companies such as Japan's 
Asahi Chemical Industries, Eastman Chemical Company of the 
United States, and Germany's Bayer AG and the Economics Ministry 
of the Netherlands, and has signed project cooperation 
agreements with General Electric of the United States and 
Germany's BASF AG, involving 122 projects of exploratory 
activity and cooperation. Recently, the ministry also signed 
agreements with the Mexican Government on economic and 
technological cooperation on petrochemical and chemical 
industries. The Ministry of Chemical Industry has so far signed 
joint-venture contracts worth a total of $230 million and 
joint-venture intention agreements involving a total of $800 
million with foreign businesses.

<F P=106> [Article by Ru Feng (1172 6912): "In the Advent of the Tide </F>
of Reentry Into GATT, Township Enterprises Must Be Tide Riders"] 
  [Text] The recent successful conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round of talks has added to the urgency of China's reentry into 
the GATT. 
  As a full participant in the Uruguay Round, China must 
restore its status as a GATT contracting party as soon as 
possible so as to sign the final act of the Uruguay Round and 
perform the obligations specified in the act. On the one hand, 
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round has provided a 
more open external environment for us to further export-oriented 
economic development. On the other hand, a more open market 
means keener competition--a new challenge to the makeup and 
quality of our exports. 
  Town and township enterprises are the main subject of this 
challenge. Generally speaking, township enterprises are faced 
with the following internal and external problems: First, we 
have a large number of township enterprises, but their 
operations are small-scale. Now, there are more than 10 million 
township enterprises, employing 110 million people. On average, 
each enterprise has less than 10 employees, and cannot take 
advantage of large-scale operations. There are only a few dozen 
enterprise groups. This makes macro-management and guidance a 
very difficult task. Second, township enterprises lack technical 
personnel, and their technology and equipment are backward. Most 
staff members and workers of township enterprises come from the 
countryside. Their education and training cannot meet the needs 
of industrialized production. Most of their equipment is 
backward, and most needs to be replaced. Third, products are not 
technology-intensive. Most of them are common, low-grade 
products, which cannot compete with imported goods. Fourth, the 
products are of poor quality. Many products are manufactured in 
a careless way, and some are fake or shoddy products. How can 
such products compete with their foreign counterparts? Fifth, 
this year the world economy will move out of difficulty and 
enter a steady-growth stage. Competition in the international 
market will be keen. In particular, our neighboring areas, such 
as Southeast Asia, are regions in the world noted for their 
relatively fast economic growth. Their economic growth rate is 
expected to surpass the European and U.S. countries by 4 
percentage points. The "threat" of competition from these 
regions will be severe. Six, China can no longer rely on such 
methods as high tariffs to protect domestic products. 
  After our "re-entry into GATT," our products will be 
directly 
subject to the impact of international market prices and world 
economic situations. The GATT's primary function is to set the 
international trade behavior of its contracting parties, and the 
contracting parties must implement a market economic system and 
enforce unified trade and tariff rules as required. How will 
township enterprises meet this challenge? This is a serious 
question before us. 
  The correct answer is: They should create brand-name 
products 
to welcome "re-entry into GATT." When the tide of "re-entry into 
GATT" comes, they should be "tide riders"! 
  1. They should launch a vigorous publicity and education 
campaign aimed at fostering and strengthening the determination 
to improve product quality. It is imperative to increase the 
leaders' and employees' sense of urgency, crisis, and 
responsibility. They should foster the intention of "improving 
their product quality with the ultimate goal of revitalizing the 
country" and reinforce their concept that "quality is the 
lifeblood of township enterprises." 
  2. They should use the strategy of creating brand-name 
products to increase the popularity and competitiveness of their 
products both at home and abroad. Authorities at all levels in 
charge of township enterprises should formulate a "brand-name 
products" strategy and put it into practice step by step. The 
state should establish a policy to give preferential treatment 
to quality products turned out by township enterprises. 
  3. They should painstakingly "improve themselves." They 
should go all out to conduct technical transformation, readjust 
the product mix, understand high technology, and develop 
high-tech products. 
  4. They should catch up with the tide of nationwide 
economic reform this year. Positive efforts should be exerted to 
implement and perfect the cooperative shareholding system, 
promote various kinds of lateral economic and technological 
alliances and cooperation, and encourage the formation of 
superior industries, manufacturers of brand-name products, or 
backbone enterprises based on the principle of voluntary 
participation. Small and mini enterprises and those operating at 
a deficit should be merged, leased out, or sold by auction. 
Township enterprises should transform their operational 
mechanism in line with the modern international enterprise 
system with a view to approaching the standard of regular 
modernized enterprises in the world.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Lu Jinong (7120 4949 6593): "The </F>
Reinforcements' Have Reserve Strength, Analysis of New Township 
Enterprises in Shanghai"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to statistics for the 
period from January to October 1993, Shanghai's township 
enterprises registered a total industrial output value of 56.174 
billion yuan, a 46.35 percent increase over the same period in 
1992, and accounted for 20.87 percent of the municipality's 
gross industrial output. During this period, township industries 
grew at a rate faster than the industrial growth of the entire 
municipality by nearly 27 percentage points. If township 
industries continue to grow at this rate, in about two years, 
its production is expected to reach one-third of the total 
industrial output value in Shanghai, a city where big 
state-owned industries are concentrated. 
  Since last year, a remarkable feature of Shanghai's new 
township enterprises is that there are more joint ventures. In 
1992, Shanghai township enterprises established 1,100 new joint 
ventures. The number of such enterprises that appeared between 
January and October 1993 surpassed the 1992 record, bringing the 
total number of joint ventures in suburban Shanghai to upwards 
of 3,000, or 47 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises in the 
municipality. That is, in terms of number, they took up almost 
"one half of the world of foreign-funded industry." Now, 
Shanghai's townships, and even some villages, are focusing on 
the promotion of joint ventures as a way to make breakthroughs 
in developing their economies. Yutang Village in suburban 
Shanghai had had no foreign-funded enterprise before May 1992. 
In August 1993, only a little more than one year had 
elapsed--the village had eight enterprises with foreign 
investment. The total investment of these enterprises was $39.22 
million, of which $29.18 million came from foreign investors. 
Now, most of them have begun production. In developing suburban 
enterprises with foreign investment, Shanghai has kept to "three 
principal methods": setting up joint ventures, transforming old 
enterprises by "grafting" new foreign-funded ventures on them, 
and developing new and high technology. Setting up joint 
ventures, and using foreign capital has solved township 
enterprises' acute shortage of funds. The "grafting" method has 
improved old enterprises and upgraded their products, and as a 
result, some loss-making enterprises have regained vitality and 
are making profits. By introducing advanced foreign technology 
and developing new products, township enterprises are able to 
gear their production to the international as well as domestic 
market instead of the domestic market alone. Statistics show 
that the value of exports by Shanghai's township enterprises was 
11.934 billion yuan between January and October 1993. Of this, 
exports of joint ventures amounted to 3.239 billion yuan, up 118 
percent compared with the same period in 1992. Foreign-funded 
enterprises have become a reinforcement force in Shanghai's 
suburbs in earning foreign exchange. 
  Starting points, large-scale operations, and high efficiency 
are other features of the new township enterprises that have 
emerged in Shanghai's suburbs. Many of the township enterprises 
established in the last two years are characterized by their 
large-scale investments, high product quality, advanced 
technology, and bright market prospects. Meanwhile, some new 
township enterprises are developing toward enterprise groups. 
The Jiabao Industrial Corporation, which was originally formed 
by four township enterprises, now has seven sub-companies, and 
its operations have been expanded to include real estate, 
domestic and international trade, as well as hotel business. Its 
assets have soared from 63 million yuan to 690 million yuan. 
Both its output value and profits have increased sharply, and 
export foreign exchange earnings have doubled year after year. 
Now, this corporation is one of the top 10 large-scale township 
enterprises in China. 
  Compared with old enterprises, Shanghai's new township 
enterprises are in a better condition, have more remarkable 
strong points, and more shining prospects for further 
development. But they are not completely without problems. Some 
major problems in their operations are: First, shortage of funds 
is still a rather striking problem. Due to an acute shortage of 
funds, some projects have been started, but cannot be completed 
and put into operation on time. A few foreign-funded enterprises 
exist in name only because their foreign capital has not been 
paid. Others are not running at full capacity due to 
insufficient revolving funds. Second, they lack professionals. 
To enter the overseas market, and hook up their operations with 
the international business community, township enterprises are 
in need of specially trained personnel in such fields as 
international trade, foreign languages, financial management, 
and accounting. For this reason, some enterprises have expressed 
the hope that the authorities concerned will make arrangements 
for training such professionals and will cooperate with 
institutions of higher learning in this regard to improve the 
quality of training. Third, there is insufficient labor. As most 
young and middle-aged laborers in Shanghai's rural areas are 
employed by either township enterprises or village-run 
enterprises, it is difficult for new enterprises to recruit 
workers. Some of the new township enterprises have to hire 
workers from other parts of the country. In some enterprises, 
child laborers hired from other places account for 80 percent of 
the labor force. This has brought about a series of new 
questions such as the workers' board and lodging, love and 
marriage, and even some public security problems. Fourth, with 
the development of the export-oriented economy, more and more 
township enterprise products are for export, and such products 
take up an increasing share of the township industry's total 
output. These township enterprises earnestly wish to do export 
business themselves. Right now, however, very few of them have 
obtained approval in this respect. For newly established 
enterprises, it is even harder to get such approval. 
  The large number of new township enterprises in Shanghai 
have 
unique strong points, but the challenges confronting them are 
grim.

and Reporters Chen Taixiang (7115 3141 4382) and Zhang Lijun 
(1728 0500 6511): "Increasing Quota Procurement Price and Set 
Protective Price for Market Transactions--The Jilin Provincial 
Government Set Grain Procurement Policy for Fall, Demanding 
Strict Compliance of Contract and Policy and Urging Greater 
Efforts To Strive To Fulfill the Procurement Task by the End of 
December"] 
  [Text] To implement the guidelines of the Central Rural 
Work Conference and the requirements of a circular issued by two 
central offices and strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and 
control of grain work, the Jilin Provincial Government held a 
provincial work conference on grain procurement on January 13, 
1994. Liu Xilin [0491 1585 2651], Standing Committee member of 
the provincial CPC committee and deputy governor, and Wang Guofa 
[3769 0948 4099], deputy governor, attended and spoke at the 
conference. Other responsible persons of various city 
(prefecture) governments and relevant departments at the 
provincial level also attended the conference. 
  After conscientiously analyzing the new situation facing the 
grain procurement work of 1994, participants at the conference 
set forth a general demand for doing a good job in the grain 
procurement work of 1994. That is to adhere to the open and 
flexible principle, strengthen macroeconomic regulation and 
control, pay equal consideration to the interests of the state, 
enterprises, and farmers, and pushing the provincial economy to 
develop still further. The general policy is to subsidize the 
quota procurement price, set a protective price for market 
transactions, further display the state's support for 
agriculture, and make farmers the real beneficiaries. 
Participants also demanded strict compliance of contracts and 
policies and urged greater efforts to strive to fulfill the 
grain procurement tasks by the end of December. 
  To do a good job in the grain procurement task in 1994, the 
conference clarified the following policy-related issues: 
  On the issue of quota grain procurement. First we should 
strictly enforce the grain quota assigned after the provincial 
government implemented the policy of "steady procurement and 
relaxed sale" and insist that farmers deliver the exact amount 
and type of grain specified in their contract to ensure the 
fulfillment of state-assigned procurement task. Second, we 
should continue to implement the policy of disaster reduction 
and exemption. Those who really need the exemption and reduction 
may be reported by the city or county government to the 
provincial government for approval in the later period of grain 
procurement. Third, we should implement the policy of 
subsidizing quota procurement prices. The State Council 
originally decided to distribute the benefits of linking 
chemical fertilizer and diesel in the form of price subsidies. 
Later, it changed to distributing such benefits mostly in the 
form of goods and some as price subsidies. Jilin Province has 
distributed some of the benefits to farmers in the form of goods 
and some as price subsidies. For instance, for 500 gram of 
standard corn, the state pays 0.198 yuan and Jilin Province pays 
0.03 yuan in subsidy, so the enforcing price for the quota 
procurement of standard corn is 0.228 yuan. For another 
instance, state price for 500 gram of standard rice is 0.351 
yuan and the provincial subsidy is 0.023 yuan, so the enforcing 
price for the quota procurement of standard rice is 0.374 yuan. 
Fourth, we should adhere to the quota grain quality and variety 
policies. In other words, all localities should strictly enforce 
the quality standard for contracts on delivery of third-grade 
and above corn and rice. In quota procurement, the two major 
categories of rice and corn cannot be replaced for one another. 
In the delivery of quota grain, water content is not limited. 
  On the issue of special reserve grain procurement. The 
policy 
and quantity of special reserve grain have not been determined 
by the state. Arrangement will be made after the state makes a 
decision. 
  On the issue of free market grain procurement. The general 
principle for dealing with free market grain in Jilin Province 
is to place no restriction on the variety of grain, encourage 
multi-channel operation, and allow prices to float with the 
market. In the meantime, we should strengthen the macroeconomic 
regulation and control by the government and establish a 
protective price system to prevent great fluctuation of market 
price and protect farmers from low prices of grain. Concrete 
requriements are: 1) The province sets a minimum protective 
price, 0.21 yuan for 500 gram of standard corn and 0.31 yuan for 
rice. 2) A guidance plan for procuring a total of 5.8 billion kg 
of market corn should be transmitted to lower levels to satisfy 
market and export needs. 3) All localities should vigorously 
guide farmers in selling market grain to protect farmers' 
interest from being adversely affected by funds and market 
nearing the end of this year and the beginning of another year. 
  On the issue of grain procurement funds and account 
settlement. The general demand is that funds must be provided 
during contract procurement, special reserve, and market grain 
and oil transactions. Giving farmers "I owe you" is absolutely 
forbidden. All departments concerned must ensure timely and 
sufficient supply of funds according to the fund raising task 
assigned to them. When settling accounts, we must insist 
settling with each and every household after delivery and 
resolutely stop the practice of "general estimation." Grain 
departments are not allowed to deduct any charges except for the 
amount of purchase contract deposit and agricultural taxes. 
  On the issue of grain market management. The general 
principle is to adhere to opening up and revitalizing, to 
strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, to ensure that 
the market is open but orderly and well managed but not stifled, 
to unclog circulation, and to accelerate production. Before the 
corn procurement task of a city or county is fulfilled, 
individuals and units other than grain departments are forbidden 
temporarily from purchasing corn. Market for other varieties of 
grain is open during the period of grain procurement.

<F P=106> [Letter to editor from Nie Zhenbang (5119 2182 6721) and Yao </F>
Changtian (1202 2490 1815) of the State Planning Commission's 
Office of Agricultural Economy] 
  [Text] Comrade Editor: Our state operated forestry areas 
consist primarily of the forests in the Northeast and Inner 
Mongolia, the southwest forests and small parcels of forest in 
the northwest. The combined state run forests employ over 1.5 
million people, have a total population of some 4 million 
people, and fixed assets of over 16 billion yuan. Since the 
founding of the PRC, state forests have produced for the nation 
some 1 billion cubic meters of lumber to ensure the needs of 
energy, railroads, disaster relief, major national construction 
projects and so forth, and continue to be responsible for the 
whole task of providing wood products under the state plan. 
  However, because forestry districts have not truly 
implemented the guidelines of the forestry operations as a basic 
policy, because investment in the forestry industry has been 
woefully inadequate, and product and industrial structure remain 
irrational, the pace of economic development in the state 
forestry regions has been slow. At present the following 
problems beset the state forestry regions. 
  1. There is a crisis in harvestable timber resources. For 
example, in the Northeast and Inner Mongolian State Forests the 
total area of harvestable mature and over-mature timber has 
decreased sharply. The area of harvestable mature and 
over-mature timber has fallen from a high of 12 million hectares 
at the time of Liberation to the present 5 million hectares, a 
drop of 53 percent. The reserves of harvestable mature and 
over-mature timber have been drastically reduced, from a high of 
2 billion cubic meters at Liberation to the present 470 million 
cubic meters, a reduction of 76.5 percent. The quality of timber 
has also fallen. In the Heilongjiang forest districts, for 
instance, the average amount of reserves per hectare has fallen 
from a Liberation high of 143.2 cubic meters to the present 90 
cubic meter level, a decline of 37.2 percent. The maturity 
structure of forests has also declined, middle and young growth 
now constitute almost 80 percent of total timber reserves. 
  At present, the resources of mature and over-mature 
timber which can be felled in all of the state run forests 
nationwide are quickly being depleted, and continued lumber 
production is becoming difficult. 
  2. Forestry enterprises are in an economic crunch. With 
the reduction in harvestable timber resources, lumber production 
has fallen year by year, and with other cost increases, in 1990 
for the first time the state forests as a whole ran at a loss. 
After two increases in the price of lumber, by 1992 some 30.3 
percent of the state forest regions were still losing money, 
losses amounted to 510 million yuan, definitely an economic 
problem. In 1992, some 42 percent of the enterprises in the 
state forest regions in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia were 
suffering losses to the tune of 400 million yuan. It was very 
common for enterprises to withhold and delay the payment of 
workers' wages. The Heilongjiang forestry system was some 440 
million yuan in arrears for workers' wages; in the Mudanjiang 
forest region the average was five months in arrears, with some 
enterprises reaching seven months. There was no way for 
enterprises to purchase the coal, fuel oils, steel and other 
materials needed for production and construction. Work stoppages 
and visits to higher authorities occurred. 
  3. The social burden of enterprises is great. In the past 
several years nonoperational expenditures have skyrocketed; 
totalling some 1.55 billion yuan in 1992 for the state forest 
regions, accounting for 96.9 percent of the year's sales 
profits. The Heilongjiang Forestry Industry Main Bureau was a 
prime example, with nonoperational expenditures for its 
enterprises reaching 760 million yuan, 138 percent of that 
year's sales profit. The enterprises historical burden is 
extremely heavy. As of 1992 forestry enterprises in the state 
forestry regions were in arrears to their welfare funds in the 
amount of 1.06 billion yuan. 
  4. Enterprises have fallen far behind in building production 
and social facilities. For example, of the 82 forestry bureaus 
established in the Northeast and Inner Mongolian State Forest 
Regions, although all have general plans, only two bureaus have 
completed construction; all of the others, to one degree or 
another, are putting individual phases into production as they 
are completed, and have no comprehensive production 
capabilities. At present that forest region has 156 final phase 
lumber mills which have not been constructed, and almost 90,000 
kilometers of road which should be but are not yet built. Living 
quarters for the workers are on the average less than four 
square meters, and most is unsophisticated housing built in the 
1950s and 1960s. 
  To stimulate economic growth in state forestry regions, we 
suggest: 
  1. Continue reforms; create the conditions in structure and 
mechanisms to get the state forestry regions' industrial sector 
on the market economy track. In the near future we first must 
promote construction and completion of the four lumber industry 
conglomerates in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia; then use this 
reform as the starting point for comprehensive enhancement of 
the forestry industrial sector's overall strength, put to actual 
use the sector's internal superiority of mutual support, and the 
rational flow and allotment of funds, assets, resources and 
labor and other elements of production, which quite possibly 
might put life back into the entire sector. Second, we should 
comprehensively institute asset management of the state forestry 
resources among the Northeast and Inner Mongolian regions' 
enterprises, making a true division between their rights of 
ownership and their rights of use, and assure recompense for 
managing state forests. This will not only solve the problem 
of "one big rice bowl" in the state forests, but also possibly 
guarantee the continued existence of the forests. 
  2. Taking the market as the guide, efficiency as the 
heart, adjust the industrial structure and the product structure 
of the state forest regions. In adjusting these, we must turn to 
the international and domestic markets, but do it in light of 
the actual conditions in the state forest regions. First we must 
set our goals, seek new growth potential for economic expansion. 
While not exacerbating the consumption of forest resources, 
concentrate investment appropriately, disposing it according to 
sector policies and industrial plans, arrange for the 
construction of a number of artificial board and paper mills. 
Regarding the newly established or expanded forestry regions 
responsible for developing forests, we should set up, in 
synchronization with these undertakings, timbering and 
transportation and in appropriate scale, forestry byproducts and 
pulp and paper and related industries. As regards forestry 
timbering and transportation facilities being built which 
already have the necessary conditions, we can try to restructure 
their industrial structure while they are still in the process 
of being built. 
  3. The state must increase investment in forestry 
enterprises. This includes increases in potable water in forest 
regions, medical facilities, rehabilitation of condemned 
buildings, and other noneconomic operational investments; 
increases in operational type investments in developing 
artificial board plants, paper mills and other large and medium 
construction projects. Increase investment in forestry 
management, to include use of World Bank loans and other 
international financial institutions to speed up the nurturing 
of forestry resources. 
  In addition, funds in the state budget and societal funds 
including foreign funds invested in the forestry sector must all 
be used for sectorial development. The state should continue to 
implement the relevant preferential treatment policies; and 
state regulated prices for wood products from the state forest 
regions should be deregulated as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Article by the Nonmetallic Materials Section of the </F>
Domestic Trade Department: "The Temporary Relief of Timber 
Shortage Has Ended; Prospects for Plywood Are Great"] 
  [Text] I. Timber Resources Will Become Tight, Prices 
Will Be Stable and Expected To Rise 
  After a comprehensive analysis of national economic 
developments, the state's macroeconomic regulation and control 
policies, and changes in the international timber market, we 
believe that in this year and the next year resources on the 
timber market will be tight, demand will pick up steadily, and 
prices will also change from current falling to stabilizing and 
rising situation. 
  1. Timber supply and demand contradiction becomes intense. 
It 
is predicted that the temporary relief of resource shortage will 
end in early 1994 and the supply and demand contradiction will 
gradually worsen. In the third quarter of 1993, due to the 
function of market mechanism, social demand declined, giving 
rise to a situation where resources appeared to be ample. 
However, this balance of supply and demand was merely a fake 
phenomenon during the period of shrinking purchasing power. The 
1994 social timber balancing plan shows that the gap between 
timber resources and social demand is approximately 1.6 million 
cubic meters. First, judging from the domestic market, national 
forests in northeast China and Nei Monggol already reached the 
rational fixed production level of 19.17 million cubic meters in 
1993. Domestic timber output is unlikely to increase 
substantially in 1994, but social demand will increase markedly 
along with the rapid growth of the national economy. Second, 
judging from the international timber market, the Clinton 
Administration has decided to ban the deforestation of 80 
percent of virgin forests on 23 million acres of federal forest 
land in the western United States. This, plus other negative 
factors, such as slowing deforestation actitivies in Canada, 
increasing log restrictions in Asia, and declining export of 
timber from Africa and South America, are bound to affect the 
market supply of timber which has become increasingly dependent 
on the international market. Third, judging from experience, 
China's timber shortage will not be easily corrected over a 
relatively long period of time. The insufficient market supply 
of timber is the major contradition, which will also exist for a 
long time. 
  2. Timber prices will stabilize while falling. In the fourth 
quarter and next year, the trend will be affected by many 
factors, both up and down factors. Factors that will cause 
timber prices to go up mainly include: 1) Along with the 
implementation of state macroeconomic regulation and control 
measures and the improvement of financial order, the production 
fund shortage of key state construction projects and production 
enterprises are expected to somewhat improve, and the evolution 
of the supply and demand contradiction will provide a good 
opportunity for the increase of timber prices. 2) Beginning 1 
July 1993, railroad freight charges went up from 0.385 yuan per 
ton kilometer to 0.535 yuan, jacking up the cost of timber 
purchases. 3) The timber price of the international market has 
gone up again. Between mid-August and mid-September, the log 
price on the November future market of Chicago increased about 
18 percent and the price for 1,000 square foot reached $316. 
The price of domestic forest zones has also remained at a 
fairly high level. Factors causing timber prices to decline 
mainly include: 1) The state macroeconomic regulation and 
control policy has achieved temporary success, and the function 
and effect of such success will continue for a fairly long 
period of time in the sphere of the economy. 2) The price of 
timber substitutes--steel and nonferrous metal--has fallen to a 
low level. 3) The large inventory of timber management units has 
played a definite role in suppressing market prices. 4) The 
mentality of timber users who buy when prices are high, not low, 
has to a certain degree worsened the falling trend of timber 
prices. 
  To sum up the above analysis, we believe that the basic 
trend 
of timber market price in 1993 and 1994 will rise gradually 
during 1994 while stabilizing. But it will not increase as it 
did in the first half of 1993. 
<H5>  II. Plywood Import Will Gradually End Fluctuation </H5>
  In the first half of 1993, resources of plywood import were 
very tight, prices were sky-high, and plywood import became the 
hot spot of business. In the third quarter of 1993, due to the 
influence of falling prices of timber and other capital goods, 
the prices of imported plywood declined somewhat. However, 
compared to the beginning of 1993, demand for imported plywood 
remains stable and the prices fairly high. 
  1. Regarding the delivery and cost of imported plywood, in 
the first three quarters of 1993, the total amount of plywood 
imported by all harbors of China decreased 21.7 percent as 
compared to that of the corresponding period of 1992. Resources 
were tight. In the first three quarters of 1993, harbors in 
northern China witnessed marked increase in the import of 
plywood, but the cost of imports remained high. Calculated 
according to the current regulatory exchange rate (1:8.6), the 
cost, insurance, and freight, after deducting other charges, was 
66.7 yuan per sheet (specifications: 1,220 by 2,440 by 3mm). 
This is basically the same as the cost after April. 
  2. After analyzing plywood import in the fourth quarter of 
1993 and in 1994, we can come to the conclusion that it is 
certain that the resources of imported plywood will become 
tighter. Since the International Tropical Forest Organizations 
demanded that Malaysia reduced plywood export by 1.5 million 
cubic meters respectively in 1992 and 1993 and Indonesia 
recently put strict control over the quota of plywood export to 
China, our initial estimate is that our plywood import this year 
will be 20 percent less than that in last year. Second, domestic 
and international demands for South Pacific plywood has 
increased substantially. New house construction rate in the 
United States has increased 2 percent as compared to 1992; over 
1.2 million houses will be built in Japan; and Korea has joined 
the competition for resources in the plywood market. 
Additionally, the peak season of remodeling and decorating in 
urban and rural areas of China at the end of this year and the 
beginning of next year is bound to fan demand for imported 
plywood. Because of this, we predict that the market of imported 
plywood will not slide substantially by yearend or at the 
beginning of next year. The prices of imported plywood will 
also rise from the current level.

<F P=106> [Article by Xu Dan (1776 3225): "Reforming, Opening Up </F>
China, Central Asia" --First paragraph is editor's note.] 
  [Text] The international research meeting "China and 
Central Asia: Development and Cooperation," sponsored by the 
China Contemporary International Relations Institute, was held 
in Beijing 9-10 August. Forty persons, including scholars and 
officials from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, and Turkey, as well 
as Chinese scholars, officials, and entrepreneurs, attended the 
meeting. To help the reader understand the relevant situation, 
we now introduce below the gist of the speeches, made by Xu Dan, 
deputy director of the China Contemporary International 
Relations Institute; the important statements made by 
(Kasianov), director, and (Aleinov), deputy director, of 
Kazakhstan's Strategic Research Institute, which is directly 
under the president; as well as the papers read out at the 
meeting by Zhao Chunguang [6392 4783 0342] of Mongolia's 
Northeast Asia Institute: 
<H3>  I. China's Reform, Opening Up to the Outside World, Economic 
Situation </H3>
  China's reform and opening up to the outside world has been 
going on for 15 years. It has caused fundamental changes in 
China's socioeconomic features, and has caused us to find the 
path of building socialism with China's characteristics. With 
Deng Xiaoping's important speech while inspecting the south in 
1992 as the starting point, in China's economic development and 
its reform and opening lup to the outside world, there has 
appeared a vigorous momentum with the following characteristics: 
  First, China's economy has entered a new long period of 
high-speed growth. Last year's Gross National Product (GNP) 
was 12.8 percent higher than that of the year before, and 
industrial production grew 20.8 percent. It was the year with 
the biggest growth since China's opening up to the outside 
world. In agriculture, a bumper harvest was wrested--a 3.7 
percent increase over that of the year before last. In the first 
half of this year, the GNP grew 13.9 percent compared with that 
of the same period last year, and the gross value of industrial 
output grew 25.1 percent. In agriculture this year, summer grain 
set a high-output record. This momentum of high-speed growth did 
not happen by chance: It rests on the foundation of the results 
obtained by the three-year economic readjustment began in 1989. 
In this period there were bumper agricultural harvests in 
successive years, there was a big improvement in the capacity 
for supplying energy and raw materials, there were successive 
years of a surplus in foreign trade, there was a big increase in 
saving deposits, and successes were obtained in all economic 
reforms. In addition, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech on his 
southern tour at the right time and the holding of the 14th CPC 
Congress gave China's economic development a looser and more 
comfortable policy and environment. 
  Second, a major breakthrough was achieved in China's 
economic reform. Last year's 14th CPC Congress proposed 
that the goal of China's economic reform be to establish a 
socialist economic system. This is a complex piece of social 
systems engineering, and its main parts are: 1) Accelerate the 
pace of economic reform and estalish a modernized enterprise 
system, so that the enterprises truly establish a modernized 
enterprise system, so that the pace of price reform and 
establish a unified open, orderly competitive market system; 2) 
accelerate the transformation of government functions and 
establish a macro regulation and control system that meets the 
demand of socialist markets; and 3) accelerate economic 
legislation and establish a legal system that meets the needs of 
the socialist market economy. 
  Third, China's opening up to the outside world has 
entered a new historical stage. In the past it was mainly 
the southeast coastal region that was opened up to the outside 
world; now the opening up has expanded to riverine and border 
cities and to interior provincial capitals and cities, forming a 
new pattern in which from east to west, from south to north, 
with provincial capitals as the center, the opening up to the 
outside world radiates to surrounding areas in all directions. 
In 1992 China's import and export trade totaled $165.6 billion, 
a 22 percent increase over that of the year before. Foreign 
businessmen invested $1.116 billion in China; 470,000 of the 
three kinds of enterprises were approved for registration, 
exceeding the total for the past dozen or so years. In the first 
half of this year, China's import and export trade totaled 
$77.81 billion, a 13.4 percent increase over that of the same 
period last year. This shows that China's political stability, 
social stability, and economic development filled with vitality 
have made foreign investors better understand that China is an 
ideal place for investment. 
  Currently, in China's economy, while there has been rapid 
growth, there have also appeared some fairly prominent problems, 
which are mainly manifested in: First, the scale of investment 
in fixed assets is too large, and there are too many newly built 
or rebuilt projects, causing a drop in macro investment results. 
Second, the financial and banking situation is fairly grim, and 
the contradiction between low financial income and high 
financial outgo has added to the difficulty of an imbalance 
between financial income and outgo. Third, the restraining 
factor of "bottlenecks" is prominent, that is, there is an 
overall strain on transport and communication, and the supply of 
raw materials does not meet the demand. The shortage of funds 
adversely affects the normal production and business activities 
of many enterprises. Fourth, price rises are too high, and the 
pressure of inflation has increased. The Chinese government's 
policy for solving these problems is not, as in the pst, to 
adopt overall retrenchment, but rather, is, through deepening 
reform, changing mechanisms, optimizing structure, and improving 
returns, to ensure and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. 
<H3>  II. The Situation After Central Asian Countries Became 
Independent and the International Effect </H3>
  The countries of Central Asia have been independent or more 
than a year, and in most of them the situation is fairly stable; 
based on our observations, the factors causing this stability 
are many-sided. First, these countries have powerful leaders. 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan have 
swiftly put into practice the presidential system, and the 
leaders enjoy fairly high prestige in their own countries; 
constitutions have been formulated, and the "democratic system" 
under the leadership of a president has been put on a legal 
basis. Second, for economic reform a policy of steady progress 
has been adopted, and "shock therapy" is not practiced. While 
reforming, each country has put into practice a social security 
system, thereby alleviating the difficulties in life encountered 
by urban and rural residents in the course of reform, and 
ensuring social stability. Third, each country has put in 
practice a policy of nationality harmony; in formulating this 
policy, the government, in the country's economic and political 
life, takes into consideration the balancing of interests among 
the nationalities and the maintaining of a harmonious 
coexistence of the nationalities. Fourth, a religious policy 
suited to the national condition has been put into practice. The 
people of Central Asia have now obtained the freedom of 
religious belief. Religions can be freely propagated in Central 
Asian countries, but the government of each country clearly 
stipulates that religious forces cannot participate in 
governmental and political affairs, and cannot adversely affect 
the political stability of the country. Because of the above 
conditions, the situation in the past more than one year has 
basically been one of stable development. However, the Central 
Asian countries are in a transitional period in which there is a 
turn in the situation, their economic difficulties are quite 
serious, and politically there are many latent factors for 
instability. Continued stability and development in the future 
will depend on great efforts by the governments of these 
countries. 
  After becoming independent, the Central Asian countries are 
daily enhancing and expanding their international position and 
influence, and Central Asia is becoming a region of interest and 
action by the international community. This is also determined 
by many factors: 1) Central Asia is located in that part of the 
world that binds together the European and Asian continents; it 
is the link between East and West, and its geographical position 
is extremely important. 
2) Central Asia is a "treasure house of natural resources"; here 
there are abundant petroleum, natural gas, nonferrous metals, 
and other mineral resources. Some countries abound in cotton, 
and people call them "white gold countries." 3) Surrounding 
Central Asia are some important countries with diferent social 
systems and different ideologies and religious beliefs. The 
Central Asian countries are building closer contacts and 
developing relations of friendship with these countries, thereby 
playing an important role in balancing the various forces. 4) 
The economic level of Central Asia is that of the developing 
countries, and it is an important force in the international 
community for maintaining peace and promoting justice. 
<H3>  III. Prospects for Cooperation Between China and Central 
Asian Countries </H3>
  Central Asia is a close neighbor of China's, and there are 
three Central Asian countries that border China; they are linked 
by common mountains and rivers, and the nationalities cross 
borders. As early as before the year 2000 or so, there will be a 
"Silk Road" that will directly link China and Central Asia. The 
Chinese government has rapidly established formal diplomatic 
relations with these countries, and has invited their leaders to 
visit China; has established a basis on the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence to develop relationships of equality and 
mutual benefit, good neighborliness and friendship; and has 
signed in many fields documents for carrying out contacts and 
cooperation. In many aspects there is an identity of interests 
between China and the Central Asian countries, and there could 
be a further deepening of cooperation and a wider development of 
relations. 
  A. In the political aspect, the identity of goals 
between the Central Asian countries and China gives hope for 
maintaining peaceful, stable internal and international 
environments. This is because the Central Asian countries 
now face many arduous tasks: politically, they must consolidte 
independence; economically, they must overcome the serious 
difficulties encountered after independence; internally, they 
must give impetus to reform, open up to the outside world, and 
ensure the tranquil life of all people in the country. All of 
this must be done under conditions of international peace. China 
is deepening its reform and expanding its opening up to the 
outside world. Therefore, with China's and Central Asia's 
security interests being identical, they can cooperate hand in 
hand, both striving for the long-term security of their own 
lands and working in common to create world peace and a rational 
new order. 
  B. In the economic aspect, the complementary nature of 
China and the Central Asian countries is very large, and the 
potential for them in this respect is far from being 
displayed. The superiority of the Central Asian countries 
lies in their abundant natural resources, a certain industrial 
base, and a gradually forming vast market. Their weak point is 
that they have a one-product economy, and they must import from 
abroad articles for use in industry and articles for daily use, 
and must import foreign capital and technology to develop 
processing industries and to exploit natural resources. At the 
same time Central Asia is an inland region; it lacks seaports, 
and its land communication depends on enhancement of its 
cooperation with surrounding neighbor countries. Because it has 
had more than 10 years of successful reform and opening up to 
the outside world, China has established a diversified industry 
with complete categories. It has a very strong capability in its 
processing industries, and it can export large amounts of light 
industry and textile, electronic, and daily-use products. Its 
building, mining, agricultural and plantation technologies have 
entered the world ranks, and it possesses the conditions for 
wider economic cooperation. The economic and trade cooperation 
between China and Central Asia is just beginning, and it may be 
conjectured that there are vast prospects for its development. 
China is accelerating its opening up to the outside world and 
its construction of its western inland and border regions, with 
the focus on developing the infrastructure for communication and 
transportation. In the next three years China will invest 8 
billion yuan in newly building or rebuilding the railroad 
network in its northwest region. From now until the year 2000, 
China will build some trunk lines of a high-grade national 
highway that will crisscross the country east, west, south, and 
north. This will be advantageous to China's internal unblocked 
transportation, and will be even more convenient for enhancing 
its cooperation with neighboring countries. China and Central 
Asia also have more conditions to put into effect a joint 
communication network, thereby causing the renewal of the Silk 
Road to become a reality. 
  C. In international affairs, China and the Central 
Asian countries have many common points. We belong to the 
developing countries and our fundamental interests are 
identical. The contacts, talks, and meetings of leaders of our 
countries prove that, on many major international issues, the 
Central Asian countries and China have identical views and 
positions and have similar stands. The position and role of 
Central Asian countries in international affairs are growing 
daily, and the relations of cooperation in foreign affairs 
between China and the Central Asian countries are becoming 
closer and closer. In the new structure of the pluralistic 
world, China and the Central Asian countries both qualify to 
become active participants in establishing a just and rational 
new international order. 
  In brief, China and the Central Asian countries in political 
affairs should become models of countries with different social 
systems coexisting in peace for long periods of time and being 
good neighbors and friends; in culture, science and technology 
should become friends who learn from each other and who advance 
together; and in international affairs should become positive 
forces for maintaining peace and stability and for extablishing 
a just, rational new world order.

<F P=106> [Article by reporters Chen Jianxiang (7115 0494 4382) and </F>
Zhao Hong (6392 4767): "DAXUESHENG Questionnaire Survey of 1,500 
Students: What Do the `New Collegians' Know About Mao Zedong?" 
The first segment in italics is a source-supplied introduction.] 
  [Text] They were born in the mid-1970's, at a time 
when Chairman Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms were passing 
away one by one and the republic was going through a most 
difficult period. 
  They grew up in a brand new era. All of the bygone glories, 
emotions, absurdities, and pains were but far away fairy tales. 
  Today, they have grown up; they are going to college. 
  They no doubt are a generation that straddles two centuries, 
destined to be the masters of the republic in the next century. 
  For the moment, we shall call them the "new collegians." 
  Mao Zedong's passing and the birth of the "new collegians" 
seemed to coincide, like two wheels on the same track, two 
consecutive pages on the calendar. There was no overlap, no 
repetition. 
  Thus, the issue of how much the "new collegians" know about 
Mao Zedong has become especially meaningful and valuable, and 
perhaps interesting. With the forthcoming 100th anniversary of 
the Chairman's birth, DAXUESHENG has handed out 1,500 copies of 
questionnaires to students in 15 colleges in the capital and in 
Hunan. Most of those polled were college students born after 
1976; the oldest among them were born in 1974. 
<H5>  Once a Household Name, But No Longer Common Knowledge Today </H5>
  Thirty-four percent do not know his place of birth, 65 
percent do not know the date of his birth or death, and 35 
percent have never read Mao Zedong's books. 
  An earth-tone peasant cottage located south of the Chang 
Jiang River, surrounded by green hills, and behind the hills, 
the red sun is slowly rising: This was a very familiar picture 
for every Chinese in the old days. It once appeared in many 
newspapers, magazines, and text books. Everybody could tell by 
sight that it was the great leader Chairman Mao's home in 
Shaoshan [7300 1472], the holy land of the revolution, the place 
of the rising sun. This was a widely-known, ever so simple, 
common knowledge, just like everybody knows that our homeland is 
China and our capital is Beijing, not to mention that countless 
hot-blooded youths had at one time come from all directions just 
to look at this place for themselves. 
  Our survey clearly showed, however, that 34 percent of the 
"new collegians" did not know Mao Zedong's place of birth. Some 
did not have the faintest idea; Some could barely recall reading 
or hearing about it, but their answers could not be more wrong: 
For example, they put down "Hunan Shaoguan," "Zhaoshan," 
"Shaoshan [4801 1472]," "Hunan Shaoxing," "Hunan Xiangtan 
Maojiaping," and so on. One knows not whether to laugh or cry. 
  Another equally common knowledge is Mao Zedong's dates of 
birth and death--26 December 1893 and 9 September 1976, 
respectively. Most older people remember those dates, especially 
the latter; it was a day engraved on their bones and hearts. 
Those who lived through the period say that those days still 
leap up vividly before their eyes. Yet, 65 percent of the "new 
collegians" cannot recall those two special dates. 
  Quotations From Mao Zedong, a product of a 
specific historic era, was at one time intimately tied to the 
lives of every Chinese. It was not long ago that even the very 
old and the very young could recite passages from the 
Quotations From Mao Zedong. But among the "new 
collegians," 8 percent have never heard of it, 49 percent have 
never seen it, and 58 percent cannot write down a passage 
attributed to Mao. Some are confused and mistake the following 
for Quotations From Mao Zedong: "Sailors of the great 
seas are dependent on the helmsman"; "fear not ten thousand, but 
guard against the unexpected"; and "one statement can refute ten 
thousand." 
  Another notable phenomenon is that among those who could 
quote Mao, 43 percent put down such famous revolutionary sayings 
as "seize the revolution; promote production"; "dig in; stock 
grain"; "never forget the class struggle"; "resort to verbal 
struggle, not armed struggle"; "Chen Yi is a good comrade." 
While we admire the power of the era of compressed words, we 
cannot help but worry: Mao Zedong thoughts are a spiritual 
wealth; they should not be simplified, distorted, and even 
forgotten so soon. 
  Perhaps they do not really prove anything. Ignorance of 
general knowledge may not hinder deeper understanding of other 
concepts. So in our questionnaire, we asked two questions about 
the books people read. Similarly, the result leaves us no room 
for optimism: thirty-two percent of the students have never read 
books about Mao Zedong. Among the books they have read, most 
have been published in recent years, including Mao Zedong 
Who Stepped Down From the Shrine; Two Sides of the 
Red Wall; The Mystery of Mao Zedong and other 
historical anecdote-type popular literature, while literary 
works by experts and scholars have much been ignored. When 
answering the question "Which Mao Zedong essay or poem have your 
read?", most students cited works reprinted in text books, such 
as "Qinyuan Spring--Snow," "Oppose Party Stereotyping," and 
"Changing the Way We Study." Outside of the textbook essays, few 
have read such well-known philosophical writings as "On 
Contradictions" and "On Practice." Counting those who have 
studied and those who have just skimmed through the book, only 
141, less than 10 percent, said they have read Selected 
Works of Mao Zedong. 
  Relatively speaking, college students in Hunan know a little 
bit more about Mao Zedong than those in Beijing. This naturally 
has to do with Hunan being the Chairman's hometown and people 
there have a special relationship with him. It is also because 
of the geographical location. Reportedly, Xiangtan University 
still organizes student field trips to Shaoshan every year, and 
there are quite a few "Mao Zedong fans" among the students. 
  But there is no denying the fact that, overall, this 
generation's college students are slowly forgetting Mao Zedong. 
  Only three years ago, this journal reported on a fad among 
the college students--"looking for Mao Zedong." In the 
post-strike campuses back then, the students had just emerged 
from their perplexed and exhausted state and were beginning to 
re-evaluate and to look for their own spiritual support, and a 
phenomenon of studying Mao Zedong's works and biographies began 
to appear. But college campuses have always been a mobile, 
changeable "camp ground"; every year's students have their own 
characteristics. Three years have gone by, when these so called 
"new collegians" entered college, things have changed. We cannot 
help but worry: What will happen to the questionnaires in 
another three years, 10 years, or 30 years? 
<H5>  In the Minds of the "New Collegians" There Is No God </H5>
  Man is man. Why even ask the question? 
  He had performed meritorious services, but he should never 
have criticized Ma Yinchu. 
  He uprooted China's economic tree, just to see if there were 
little worms. 
  Those who lived through the Mao Zedong era inevitably coat 
their criticism of Mao with an emotional overtone. The workers 
and the peasants, the intellectuals, the "three old graduating 
classes" [laosanjie], the red guards, and the "five black 
classes"--landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad 
elements, and rightists-- people of different professions, from 
different classes, of different ages, with different 
experiences, and from different family backgrounds have 
different emotions about Mao. Except in strict academic studies 
or under very formal circumstances, when people talk about Mao 
Zedong, they inevitably mix in their personal feelings. They may 
worship him or hate him; they may be very critical or lenient; 
they may be obedient or rebellious. In short, it seems nobody 
can be truly fair or objective. 
  On the other hand, during the Cultural Revolution, people 
once worshipped Mao zealously and almost religiously and took 
part in large-scale movements to turn him into a god. This 
movement lasted a decade. Its marks cannot be easily erased. It 
deeply affected the psyche of every Chinese man and woman, and 
even today, in the hearts of many, Mao Zedong is still a 
mysterious figure, a "god" that appeared only once every 500 
years. This is clearly shown in the way the older citizens put 
up, and worship Mao Zedong's picture. Furthermore, catering to 
the masses, some tasteless publications have played up idealist 
things like The Mystery of 9 September and The 
Mystery of 8341, adding to the people's misconceptions. On 
one occasion, people cried out in horror that "social opinion 
has returned Mao Zedong to the shrine!" 
  These do not seem to have an effect on the "new collegians." 
They are able to assess Mao Zedong more objectively and calmly. 
The survey showed that 94 percent of the students thought of Mao 
Zedong as a man; some even said they did not comprehend the 
question. They said that a man is a man; pure and simple. Why 
ask questions? Some put down in the questionnaire: In our 
generation, there is no "god"! 
  They fully accept the magnificent, indestructible things Mao 
Zedong had accomplished as the founder of the republic, but they 
are not afraid to recount what they think are Mao Zedong's 
mistakes. Although some viewpoints may be naive and biased, they 
are not blindly following others nor echoing someone else's 
viewpoints; they are not quoting the same old cliches. 
  "Mao Zedong indeed accomplished a lot, but he should never 
have criticized Ma Yanchu, there are a lot of people like that 
now." 
  "His mistake was that he did not cleanly walk away from it 
all when he should." 
  "He liberated China, saving 400 million people. He mobilized 
the Cultural Revolution, ruining 800 million citizens." 
  "He forgot that one can conquer the world but one cannot 
rule 
the world on horseback." 
  "He uprooted China's economic tree, just to see if it has 
little worms." 
  "Stemming from the romantic and idealistic disposition of a 
poet, he treated the construction of China as a great poem. But 
this is not a poem after all." 
  These strange and novel ideas of the "new collegians" will 
never appear in any official document or history textbook. 
<H5>  This Is a Free-Thinking Bunch; We Have Eyes of Our Own </H5>
  I most admire his leadership style that embodied the 
characteristics of a politician, strategist, philosopher, and 
poet. 
  I admire his ability to swim across the Changjiang River at 
age 76. 
  I do not admire him. 
  The "new collegians" have no historical burden, no bondage 
of 
outmoded conventions and bad customs, and at the same time, they 
have fine qualities and a good education, and therefore they 
have a vivid mind, sharp eyes, unique thinkings, and 
unconventional ideas. We became keenly aware of these in the 
course of analyzing the questionnaires and during the informal 
discussions. 
  On the question "For what do you most admire Mao Zedong?", 
we 
received many different answers which fully reflected the 
students' vivid minds and their diverse choices. They cited his 
military talents--his ability to devise strategies on the spot 
and execute commands with ease, his political talents--his 
farsightedness and ability to make important decisions, his 
personal charisma--his openheartedness and selflessness, and his 
powerful, natural literary style and poetic talents. 
  Some wrote, "I most admire Mao Zedong's leadership style 
that 
embodies the characteristics of a statesman, strategist, 
philosopher, and poet"; "I most admire his sacrificing eight of 
his relatives for the sake of the revolution"; "I most admire 
his will in resisting outside pressure"; "I most admire his 
ability to swim across the Changjiang River at age 76"; "I most 
admire his embodiment of the romanticism of a poet and the 
strong and sensible spirit of the sons and daughters of the 
peasantry." "I most admire his unusual lifestyle." 
  We separated the answers into general categories, and data 
showed that personal charisma, political talent, military 
ability, and literary ability and knowledge each accounted for 
about 20 percent; there was no special concentration in any one 
category. 
  Meanwhile, some people frankly said, I do not admire him! 
  This is not an isolated answer. A decade or so ago, this 
would have amounted to treason and heresy. Those who uttered 
those words could have been branded "active 
counterrevolutionaries." Times have changed. We have said 
goodbye to the Don Quixote era of making "class struggle the key 
link." Although the question of whether Mao Zedong was admirable 
should be explored and debated, we must first be willing to 
accept different viewpoints. A society that respects choice is a 
civilized and progressive society. 
  A coed at the Hunan Normal University said with 
self-confidence, "I have eyes of my own. I use my own eyes to 
judge all things, including Mao Zedong." 
  This is the "new collegian," a rising new generation. 
<H3>  We Are Concerned About the Present; We Are the Generation 
Holding the Relay Baton </H3>
  Mao Zedong made the Chinese people stand up; Deng 
Xiaoping made the Chinese people rich. 
  "Mao Zedong craze" was a reflection of the people's 
spiritual 
needs in a changing society. 
  Are economic development and deteriorating social standards 
two extremes without compromise? 
  A Beijing Aeronautical Engineering Institute student asked 
us 
in all sincerity, "Why are we always quibbling over the rights 
and wrongs of our predecessors? Should we not make better use of 
the time to get things accomplished instead?" 
  True, if history is like a relay race, then regardless of 
whether those who ran before us were a success or a failure, the 
relay baton has been passed into our hands, and the important 
thing now is to run our own leg and hand the baton to those who 
come after us with a clear conscience. We discuss and ponder 
over the successes and failures of our predecessors just to find 
out what we can and to learn what can be learned. Our focus is 
still on the present. 
  When talking about the first generation leader, Mao Zedong, 
people cannot help but think of the second generation leader, 
Deng Xiaoping. In our questionnaire, we asked, "Do you find 
anything in common between the two great men, Mao Zedong and 
Deng Xiaoping?" On this, the "new collegians" have their own 
opinions on the two leaders' politics, strategies, and 
personalities: "They were farsighted and brilliant; they refused 
to be confined by old conventions and dared to speak what other 
people dared not speak"; "they understood China and the Chinese 
people very well"; "they were concerned about the people's 
pains"; "they each created an era of their own in China. Mao 
Zedong made the Chinese people stand up, and Deng Xiaoping made 
the Chinese people rich." 
  On the "Mao Zedong craze" in recent years, the "new 
collegians" have different opinions. A majority viewpoint is 
that it is a reflection of the people's spiritual need in a 
changing society. People are dissatisfied with the adverse 
phenomena that accompany reform and open up: corruption, unfair 
distribution, poor social morals, the tendency to put money 
above everything else, and the erosion of human relationship. 
Some people are at a loss spiritually; they know not what to do. 
They miss the clean, honest, and simple life of the Mao Zedong 
era. Eighty percent of the "new collegians" expressed 
satisfaction with today's living standards, but they also 
understand the above-mentioned adverse phenomena. Although they 
did not experience the Mao Zedong era first hand, they too yearn 
for that kind of rich, uplifted spirit. In the survey and during 
the informal discussions, they expressed their own dilemma and 
thoughts. In fact, they are the same dilemma and thoughts of all 
contemporary Chinese men and women. Of course we cannot return 
to the poverty, backwardness, and closed society of the past, 
but is there no compromise between the two extremes of economic 
development and deteriorating social standards? How do we uphold 
the mainstream of reform and open up while effectively 
eliminating its undesirable by-products? 
  Perhaps this is where we must "continue to work hard" in our 
leg of the race. 
  When we first put the concepts of "Mao Zedong" and the "new 
collegians" together, we felt a sense of professional 
excitement. Yet at this point, the pen in our hands has become 
heavy. Our thoughts have transcended "Mao Zedong" and the "new 
collegians" to travel back to the last century and the century 
before and to race ahead into the next century and the century 
after that. 
  Isn't this how the Chinese nationality goes from history to 
the future?

<F P=106> [By Deng Xiaoping: "Gist of Speeches Made in Wuchang, </F>
Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shanghai -- from 18 January to 21 February 
1992." Numerals in parenthesis are explained in notes at end of 
text] 
  [Text] I 
  I was here in Guangdong in 1984. At that time, rural reform 
had been under way for several years, while urban reform and the 
construction of the special economic zones (1) were just 
beginning. Eight years have elapsed. This time, during my trip 
here, I have found that the rapid growth in Shenzhen and Zhuhai 
special economic zones and some other areas is beyond my 
expectations. After what I've seen, my confidence has 
multiplied. 
  Revolution emancipates productive forces, so does reform. 
The overthrow of the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism 
and bureaucrat-capitalism has helped release the productive 
forces of the Chinese people. This is revolution, and thus, 
revolution brings about the emancipation of productive forces. 
After the establishment of the basic socialist system, it is 
still necessary to fundamentally change the economic structure 
that has hampered the development of productive forces and to 
establish a vigorous and dynamic socialist economic structure to 
promote the development of productive forces. This is reform, 
and thus reform also brings about the emancipation of productive 
forces. In the past, we only stressed development of productive 
forces under socialism, without any mention of the need for 
their emancipation through reform. Such formulations are 
incomplete. Both the emancipation and the development of 
productive forces should be addressed. 
  In upholding the line, principles and policies since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China (in 1978 -- Tr. [translator]), it is 
essential to adhere to the principle of "one central task and 
two basic points." (One central task is economic construction, 
two basic points are adherence to the four cardinal principles 
of socialism, the Communist Party leadership, the people's 
democratic dictatorship, and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong 
Thought; and persisting in reform and opening policies -- Tr.) 
Without adherence to socialism, implementation of the reform and 
opening policy, development of the economy, and improvements in 
the livelihood of the people, we would find ourselves in a blind 
alley. The basic line should be adhered to for 100 years, and 
there must be no vacillation. Only by keeping to this line can 
we win the trust and support of the people. Anyone who attempts 
to change the line, principles and policies adopted since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee will not 
be countenanced by the man in the street and will be toppled. I 
have said this several times. Without the achievements of the 
reform and opening policy, we could not have weathered the June 
4th Incident (2). And if we had failed, chaos would have 
prevailed and a civil war would have broken out. The "cultural 
revolution" was a civil war. Why was our country able to 
maintain stability after the June 4th Incident? It was because 
we had carried out the reform and opening policy, which has 
boosted economic growth and improved the people's living 
standards. Therefore, the army and the state power should 
safeguard this line and system and these policies. 
  In the short span of the past 10-plus years, the rapid 
development of our country has delighted the people and focused 
world attention. This fact suffices to prove the correctness of 
the line, principles and policies adopted since the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Nobody can 
change this even if he wants to. After all that's been said, 
one sentence sums it up: stick to this line and these 
principles and policies. Since the reform and opening policy 
was carried out, we have formulated quite a few statutes, which 
are all-inclusive. Clear-cut guidelines and policies have been 
worked out and expressed in accurate language concerning the 
economy, politics, science and technology, education, culture 
and military and foreign affairs. The recent Eighth Plenary 
Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee (3) was a successful 
meeting. It affirmed that the rural household contract 
responsibility system with remuneration linked to output should 
remain unchanged. Any change in that system might cause unease 
among the people, who would assert that the Party Central 
Committee had altered its policy. In the initial period of the 
rural reform, there emerged in Anhui Province the issue of the 
so-called "Idiot's Melon Seeds." (4) At that time, many people 
felt uncomfortable with this man who made a profit of 1 million 
yuan. They called for a struggle against him. I said that he 
should not be touched, because such a move might cause people to 
claim that the policy had changed, and the loss would far 
outweigh the gain. There are many more issues of this kind, and 
if not properly handled, they could easily shake our policies 
and affect the overall situation of reform. The basic policies 
for urban and rural reform must be kept stable for a long time 
to come. 
  Of course, as the reform is implemented, these policies 
should be improved or amended wherever necessary. But we should 
remain unwavering in our general direction. It is alright even 
if there are no new ideas. The main thing is that we don't 
change these policies and don't let people feel our policies 
have altered. Then, there will be great hopes for China. 
<H6>  II. </H6>
  We should be bolder than before in conducting reform and 
opening, and have the courage to experiment. We must not be 
like women with bound feet. Once we have a clear objective in 
our minds, we should dare to struggle and achieve breakthrough. 
The important experience of Shenzhen is daring to pioneer. 
Without a daring and adventurous spirit and without energy and 
vigor, it is impossible to break a good, new path and start new 
undertakings. Who dares to claim that he is 100 percent sure of 
success right from the outset and without taking any risk? 
There is no such thing as infallibility. I have never had such 
notions as thinking I'm 100 percent correct. Every year, the 
leadership should sum up experience, they should persist in what 
is correct and take immediate steps to amend what is wrong, and 
as new problems emerge, they should lose no time in tackling 
them. It will probably take another 30 years to form a more 
mature and better established system in all fields of endeavor. 
The principles and policies under such a system will be better 
shaped. We have increasingly enriched our expertise in building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Judging from the 
provincial press, much know-how with local features has been 
accumulated. This is good. Creativity is precisely what we 
want. 
  Those who are unable to move ahead with reform and opening, 
and who lack the courage to break new ground, are, to put it 
bluntly, afraid that they would be introducing too many 
capitalist factors, and therefore taking the capitalist road. 
The crux of the matter is whether this road is "capitalist" or 
"socialist." The criterion in making such a distinction should 
primarily be whether it promotes the growth of productive forces 
in a socialist society, whether it enhances the overall national 
strength of the socialist state and the people's living 
standards. As to the concept of building special economic 
zones, some people disagreed with the idea right from the start, 
fearing that it would mean practicing capitalism. The 
achievements in the construction of Shenzhen gave a definite 
answer to these doubters: special economic zones practice 
"socialism," not "capitalism." In the case of Shenzhen, the 
public ownership sector constitutes the mainstay, with foreign 
investment accounting for only a one-fourth share. Even in the 
sector of foreign capital, we can benefit from taxation and 
labor services. We should have more of these three kinds of 
ventures. (5) There is no reason to be afraid of them. We 
dread nothing so long as we keep our heads sober. We have our 
advantages; we have the large and medium-sized state-run 
enterprises and the rural enterprises. More importantly, state 
power is in our hands. Some people argue that capitalism will 
grow as more foreign capital flows in, that capitalist factors 
will spread as foreign-funded enterprises increase, and that 
means the development of capitalism. These people lack basic 
common sense. In the current stage, foreign-funded enterprises 
in China are allowed to make money in accordance with existing 
regulations and policies. But the state levies taxes, workers 
get wages, and we can learn technology and management. In 
addition, we can secure information and expand our markets. 
Therefore, subject to the constraints of China's overall 
political and economic conditions, foreign-funded enterprises 
are useful supplements to the socialist economy and in the final 
analysis, they are conducive to socialism. 
  Whether there should be more planning or more market factors 
is not the essential difference between socialism and 
capitalism. The planned economy is not equivalent to socialism 
because there is planning under capitalism too, and the market 
economy is not equivalent to capitalism because there is a 
market under socialism too. Both planning and markets are 
economic means. The basic nature of socialism is to emancipate 
and develop the productive forces, eliminate exploitation, rule 
out polarization, and ultimately achieve common prosperity. 
This principle must be made clear to the people. Are 
securities and the stock market good or bad? Is there any 
danger with them? Are such things unique to capitalism? Can 
socialism make use of them? We allow a wait-and-see attitude 
but experiments should be conducted resolutely. If our judgment 
proves correct and feasible after one or two years of practice, 
the stock market may be extended. Otherwise, we may simply 
close it. We may close it quickly or slowly or leave a loose 
end. Why be afraid? So long as we stick to this attitude, it 
will be alright and we will not commit any major mistakes. In 
brief, if socialism wants to win the edge over capitalism, it 
must be bold to absorb and learn all civilized achievements 
created by human society and all advanced forms of operation and 
management which reflect the laws governing modern socialized 
production practiced in various countries around the world 
today, including developed capitalist nations. 

    To take the road of socialism is to realize common 
prosperity 
step by step. The concept of common prosperity was put forward 
in this way: where conditions permit, some areas may develop 
faster than others. Regions which enjoy faster advance can help 
promote the progress of the less developed regions, finally 
achieving common affluence. If the rich keep getting richer and 
the poor poorer, polarization will emerge. The socialist system 
should and can avoid polarization. One solution is to let 
regions first becoming prosperous support poverty stricken areas 
by paying more taxes and profits. Of course, this should not be 
done too soon. At present, we should not weaken the dynamics of 
developed areas, nor encourage the practice of "eating from one 
big pot." When and on what basis we raise and settle this issue 
requires deliberation. It can be envisaged that by the end of 
this century, when China reaches a moderately prosperous level, 
we should raise and settle this issue. By that time, while 
advanced areas should continue to grow, they should also 
vigorously help underdeveloped areas through paying more profits 
and taxes and transferring technology. Most of the 
underdeveloped areas abound in resources and have great 
potential for development. In short, taking the country as a 
whole, we are certainly able to settle the problem regarding the 
wealth gap between the coastal and hinterland areas gradually 
and smoothly. 
  Opinions were divided over the reform and opening policy at 
the very beginning. This is normal. The difference was not 
only over the issue of the special economic zones, but also 
included the bigger issue, that of the rural reform featured by 
the introduction of the rural household contract responsibility 
system with remuneration linked to output and the abolition of 
the people's commune system. (6) Initially, in the country as a 
whole, only one- third of the provinces engaged in reform. By 
the second year, more than two-thirds of them had followed suit 
and almost all the remainder joined in the third year. At 
first, people were not enthusiastic about rural reform and many 
took a wait-and-see attitude. Our policy permits this stance, 
which is much better than coercion. In carrying out the line, 
principles and policies adopted since the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we did not resort to 
compulsion and mass movement. People were allowed to follow the 
line on a voluntary basis, doing as much as they wished. In 
this way, others gradually followed suit. Absence of raised 
contention is one of my inventions, which is aimed at buying 
time for an endeavor. Once disputes occur, they will complicate 
matters and waste much time. As a result, nothing will be done. 
Without controversy, we can make bold experiments and forge 
ahead without hesitation. The rural reform has followed this 
pattern and it should also be the case with urban reform. 
  At present, Rightist tendencies are affecting us, as are 
"Leftist" ones. But it is the "Leftist" tendencies that are 
deep-seated. Some theorists and politicians try to scare the 
public with political labels. That is not Rightist, but 
"Leftist." "Leftism" carries a revolutionary color, giving the 
impression that the more "Left," the more revolutionary. 
"Leftist" tendencies led to dire consequences in the history of 
the Party. Some fine things were destroyed overnight. Rightism 
may ruin socialism, so can "Leftism." China should maintain 
vigilance against the Right but should primarily guard against 
the "Left." The Right exists as displayed in the turmoil. The 
"Left" also lives. To regard reform and opening as introducing 
and developing capitalism and to see the danger of peaceful 
evolution coming mainly from areas of the economy are "Leftist" 
tendencies. We must keep a clear head, then we will not commit 
gross errors. And once problems emerge, they can be put right 
and corrected easily. 
<H6>  III. </H6>
  In grasping opportunities to promote our development, it is 
essential to boost the economy. At present, some neighboring 
countries and regions have registered faster economic growth 
than us. If we fail to progress or advance too slowly, a 
problem will arise when our people make comparisons with 
surrounding states and regions. Therefore, those blessed with 
conditions advantageous to development should not be obstructed. 
In areas where conditions permit, local development should 
proceed as fast as possible. Nothing is to be dreaded so long as 
we stress efficiency and quality, and develop the 
export-oriented economy. Low speed equals stagnation and even 
retreat. Opportunity must be grasped. The present offers 
excellent chance. I worry that we may lose it. If we fail to 
seize the opportunity, it will slip from our hand as time flies. 
  In developing China's economy, we should strive to reach a 
new rung every few years. Of course, this should not be 
interpreted as encouraging an unrealistic high speed. We should 
be down to earth and stress efficiency to realize steady and 
coordinated progress. Guangdong, for example, should vault 
several steps and strive to catch up with the "four small 
dragons" (7) of Asia in 20 years. In relatively developed areas 
such as Jiangsu, growth should be faster than the national 
average. Take Shanghai for another example. It has every 
necessary condition for faster progress. It enjoys obvious 
advantages in personnel, technology and management and has 
far-flung influences. In retrospect, one of my major errors was 
failure to include Shanghai when we started the four special 
economic zones. Otherwise, the situation in the reform and 
opening in the Chang Jiang River Delta, the entire Chang Jiang 
River valley and even the whole country would be quite 
different. 

    Viewed from the experience of recent years, economic 
development can reach a new stage every few years. We actually 
started reform in 1980. In 1981, 1982 and 1983, reform was 
primarily in rural areas. In 1984, the focus turned to urban 
areas. The years from 1984 to 1988 witnessed comparatively rapid 
economic growth. During those five years, rural reform brought 
about many changes, which were characterized by substantial 
increase in crop production and farmers' income and the rise of 
rural enterprises as a new force. Purchasing power of farmers 
increased and numerous new houses were built. Along with some 
luxurious consumer goods, the "four major articles" -- bicycle, 
sewing machine, radio and watch -- entered ordinary farming 
households. The increase of farm and side-line products, the 
expansion of rural markets and the transfer of surplus rural 
labor vigorously stimulated industrial development. 
  In those five years, the gross industrial output value 
amounted to over 6,000 billion yuan, with an average annual 
growth rate of 21.7 percent. Industrial products increased by a 
big margin in the areas of food, garments, housing, transport 
and commodities of daily use, including color TV sets, 
refrigerators and washing machines. Capital goods such as rolled 
steel and cement experienced substantial growth as well. In 
this way, agriculture and industry, and rural and urban areas 
interacted and promoted each other. This gives us a vivid, 
convincing picture of the development process. It can be said 
that during this period, China's wealth swelled considerably and 
the national economy mounted a new stage. From 1989, we began 
the drive to improve the economic environment and rectify the 
economic order, which I endorsed since it was indeed necessary. 
The overheated economy resulted in a number of problems. For 
instance, the issue of excess bank notes led to a major price 
fluctuation. Duplicate construction was prevalent and caused 
waste. 
  However, what would be a comprehensive view of the five 
years 
of accelerated development? Those five years could be called a 
leap forward, but unlike the earlier "Great Leap Forward," (8) 
it did not hurt the organic whole and the mechanisms for 
economic development. In my opinion, that period made no small 
contributions. The economic readjustment effort obtained some 
achievements. But in judging these years, can we consider only 
the economic readjustment drive as contribution to stability, or 
should the half decade of accelerated growth also be counted as 
a contribution? At least in one respect? Without the leap 
forward in those years when the overall economy went up to a new 
level, the retrenchment drive in the following three years could 
not have proceeded so smoothly. It seems that we should hold on 
to opportunities in a certain period to accelerate our 
development for several years. As problems crop up in the 
process, we will solve them immediately and continue to forge 
ahead. Fundamentally speaking, when we gain in economic 
strength, we will gain the initiative in handling the various 
contradictions and problems. For a major developing nation like 
China, it is impossible to attain a slightly faster economic 
growth always at such a calm and smooth pace. Attention must be 
paid to steady and coordinated development, but steadiness and 
coordination are only relative, not absolute. Development is 
the cardinal principle. The issue should be made clear. If we 
fail to make a proper analysis and thus incur misunderstanding, 
we will become overcautious and dare not emancipate our minds 
and act boldly. Consequently, we will lose opportunities. Like 
a boat sailing against the current, we must forge ahead or be 
swept downstream. 
  Foreign experience has shown that some countries have 
experienced rapid development periods or undergone a number of 
high growth stages, as demonstrated in Japan, South Korea and 
parts of Southeast Asia. Now, we have all the necessary 
domestic conditions and enjoy favorable international 
environments. Furthermore, we can display the superiority of 
the socialist system whereby we can pool efforts to undertake 
major work, thus it is possible as well as necessary, in the 
prolonged process of China's modernization drive, for us to 
bring about several fast-growth periods with good economic 
returns. We must foster such ideals and ambitions. 
  Fast development of the economy must depend on science, 
technology and education. I've said that science and technology 
are the prime productive force. Over the past one or two 
decades, they have progressed most rapidly in the world! One 
breakthrough in the high-tech field will promote the growth of 
several industries. Could we have developed so rapidly in recent 
years without science and technology? We must advocate science 
for it is where our hope lies. Over the past decade, China has 
recorded substantial progress in science and technology. I hope 
greater progress can be obtained in the 1990s. Every trade 
should set a definite strategical target that must be attained. 
China should have its place in the world in the high tech areas 
as well. I am no professional, but I should thank the 
scientists and technological experts for their contributions to 
China and the honors they have won for our country. We should 
keep in mind the days when scientists of the older generation, 
such as Qian Xuesen (9), Li Siguang (10) and Qian Sanqiang (11), 
successfully developed the atomic and hydrogen bombs, the 
satellite and many other high technologies under extremely 
difficult conditions. We should say scientists are luckier now 
as they enjoy better conditions than their predecessors and so 
we may require more of them. I have said that intellectuals are 
part of the working class. Veteran and middle-aged scientists 
are important and so are their young counterparts. We hope all 
those studying abroad will come back. All overseas students may 
return and enjoy proper arrangements, regardless of their 
previous political attitude. This policy toward them must 
remain unchanged. They should be told that it's better to return 
home if they want to make their contributions. I hope that 
concerted efforts will be made to accelerate progress in China's 
scientific, technological and educational undertakings. We will 
develop science and technology, and the higher and newer the 
technologies the better. And we will be all the more delighted, 
as will the people and the nation. We love our country, we 
should make it more developed and prosperous. 
<H6>  IV. </H6>
  We should persist in tackling two matters: On the one hand 
reform and opening, and on the other, a crack down on all sorts 
of criminal activities. We must be steadfast with regard to 
both. We must not be soft in striking at all felonious acts and 
wiping out various evils. Guangdong is trying to catch up with 
Asia's "four small dragons" in 20 years, a goal not only in 
terms of economic growth, but also of improved public order and 
general social environment. We should surpass them in both 
material and cultural construction. Only this can be regarded 
as socialism with Chinese characteristics. Singapore boasts 
good public order under a strict administration. We should 
learn from their experience and surpass them in this regard. 
Since China opened its door to the outside world, decadent 
things have come in along with the others and vices such as 
drug-taking, prostitution and economic crimes have emerged in 
some areas. Special attention must be paid to these problems 
and resolute measures be taken to ban and crack down on vice, 
never allowing it to spread unchecked. After the founding of 
New China, it took only three years to wipe out these maladies. 
Who in the world can eliminate opium-smoking and drug-taking? 
Neither the Kuomintang nor capitalism could have succeeded in 
doing this. But facts have proved the Communist Party capable 
of exterminating these depravities. During the entire process 
of reform and opening, we must persistently oppose corruption. 
To cadres and Party members, the building of a clean government 
is a matter of great importance. In addition, we must depend on 
the legal system, which provides a securer guarantee. In short, 
we can ably build up a socialist civilization with advanced 
culture and ideology so long as we develop our productive 
forces, maintain a certain level of economic growth rate and 
stress the two tasks of reform and crack down on criminal 
activities. 
  In the whole process of reform and opening, we must 
persistently adhere to the four cardinal principles. At the 
Sixth Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central Committee (12), I 
pointed out that the struggle against bourgeois liberalization 
must be conducted for 20 years. Now it seems it will take 
longer. The rampant spread of bourgeois liberalization may have 
serious consequences. It has taken the special economic zones 
more than 10 years to reach the present stage. They can 
collapse overnight. Collapse is easy but construction is 
difficult. If we neglect the symptoms, troubles will occur. 
  Defending the socialist system with the proletarian 
dictatorship is a basic viewpoint of Marxism. Marx said the 
concept of class struggle was not his invention. His real 
creation was the theory of the proletarian dictatorship. 
History has proved that the rising and fledgling class that has 
just taken over power is, generally speaking, weaker than its 
hostile class. It must therefore resort to dictatorship in 
consolidating its political power. Democracy is applied for the 
people and dictatorship over the enemy. This is the people's 
democratic dictatorship. It is just and not in the least wrong 
to consolidate the people's power by employing the force of the 
people's democratic dictatorship. We have practiced socialism 
for only several decades and are still in the primary stage. It 
will take a considerably long historical period to consolidate 
and develop the socialist system, and that requires unremitting 
efforts and struggle by several generations or 10 or even dozens 
of generations to come. We must never treat the matter lightly. 
<H6>  V. </H6>
  A correct political line must be guaranteed by a correct 
organizational line. In a sense, personnel form the key to the 
issue of whether we can do well in China's domestic matters, 
whether socialism, reform and opening can be adhered to, and 
whether the economy can grow faster and the country enjoy 
longterm peace and stability. 

    Imperialism has pursued peaceful evolution in China, placing 
its hope on the generations to come after us. Comrade Jiang 
Zemin and his peers can be regarded as the third generation, and 
there will be a fourth and fifth. As we of the older generation 
are still alive and carry weight, hostile forces realize that no 
change is possible. But after we are dead and gone, who will 
arise as a bulwark? Therefore, we must educate the army, the 
organs of dictatorship, the Communist Party members and the 
people including the youth. If anything goes wrong in China, it 
will have its root within the Party. We must keep a clear head. 
We must pay attention to the fostering of successors, selecting 
and promoting those with both ability and political integrity to 
the leadership in line with the requirements of being 
"revolutionary, young in age, well educated and professionally 
competent." Continuation of the Party's basic line for 100 
years and long-term peace and stability in the country depend on 
this condition. It is relevant to the overall situation. This 
is a current issue that has not been settled smoothly. I hope 
it will be resolved satisfactorily. The issue drew my attention 
when I resumed work after the "Cultural Revolution." We found 
that we veterans alone could not settle the problem of realizing 
enduring stability, so we recommended others, genuinely looking 
to the third generation. But the problem remained unsolved. 
Two persons have failed, and not on economic issues, but on the 
issue of opposing bourgeois liberalization. We could not make 
concessions in this regard. In late May 1989, I said that we 
should be bold to choose for the new leadership those who are 
widely acknowledged to be steadfast followers of the reform and 
opening policy, with records of good performance. This would 
convince the populace that we are sincerely and wholeheartedly 
engaged in reform and opening. The masses judge from practical 
results. When they see that socialism, and the reform and 
opening policies are still the best, our cause will flourish 
forever. Further efforts should be made to choose and promote 
young people to leadership. The present central leadership is a 
little advanced in years. Those slightly over 60 are counted as 
young. They may work another 10 years. But in 20 years' time 
when they are over 80, they may be able to chat and talk like 
what I'm doing today, but they won't have enough energy to 
concentrate on work. The current central leadership has done a 
good job, of course, many problems remain, but problems are 
never few at any time. [sentence as published] It is essential 
for elders like us to stand aside and give young comrades a free 
hand, waiting for them to mature. We elders should consciously 
offer our seats to them and give them some help, but never 
putting obstacles in their way. Older people should, out of 
goodwill, help them when matters are bandied improperly. We 
must pay attention to the fostering of successors. I insisted 
on retiring in order to avoid making possible old-age mistakes. 
The elderly have both strong and weak points. They tend to be 
stubborn, and therefore, they should be aware of their 
limitations. As they age, they should make greater efforts to 
avoid errors in the final stage of their life and be more 
modest. Now we must continue choosing younger comrades and help 
them mature. Blind faith is not in order. I was already in a 
high position in my twenties. I was no more knowledgeable than 
you, but I did my job. More young people must be chosen, helped 
and trained and allowed to bloom. When they reach maturity, we 
will feel relieved. At present, we still have worries. 
Essentially, we must deftly manage the internal affairs of the 
Communist Party and prevent any trouble from arising. Then we 
may rest assured. Whether or not the line established at the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee for 
China's development can continue depends on you, especially on 
the education of future generations. 
  We are now facing a problem of formalism. TV news programs 
are full of meetings, there are too many conferences. Articles 
and speeches are lengthy, and they are repetitious with little 
fresh language. Reiteration in speech is needed, but one must 
be concise. Formalism is a kind of bureaucracy. We must spend 
more time on practical matters. That means saying less and 
doing more. Chairman Mao did not convene prolonged meetings, 
his essays were short and concise and his speeches succinct. He 
asked me to draft the work report to be delivered by Premier 
Zhou at the Fourth National People's Congress on the proviso it 
be no more than 5,000 Chinese characters. I fulfilled the task. 
Surely 5,000 Chinese characters were adequate. I suggest you 
do something about this problem. 
  In studying Marxism, we must grasp the essence and learn 
what 
is effective. Weighty tomes are for a small number of 
specialists, how can the masses read them? It is formalistic 
and impracticable to require that all people read such works. 
My first initiators into Marxism were Manifesto of the 
Communist Party and The A.B.C of Communism. 
Recently, some foreign commentators have been saying that 
Marxism cannot be toppled. This is so not because of the 
existence of so many magnum opuses, but because Marxism is the 
irrefutable truth. Seeking truth from facts is the essence of 
Marxism. This is what we must advocate, not bookism. The 
success of the reform and opening has not relied on books, but 
on practice and the spirit of seeking truth from facts. The 
patent right for inventing the rural household contract 
responsibility system with remuneration linked to output belongs 
to the farmers. Many things in the rural reform stemmed from 
the grass-roots. We have turned them into general guides for 
the whole country after processing and upgrading. Practice 
serves as the sole criterion of truth. I have not read many 
books, but I believe in Chairman Mao's thesis of seeking truth 
from facts. In the past, we relied on this in fighting wars; 
and we continue to rely on this in the current construction and 
reform. We have advocated Marxism all our lives and in fact, 
Marxism is not abstruse. Marxism is a simple thing, a very 
simple truth. 
<H6>  VI. </H6>
  I am convinced that the number of people espousing Marxism 
will increase in the world, because it is a science. It has 
uncovered the law governing the development of human society by 
using historical materialism. Feudal society replaced slave 
society, capitalism supplanted feudalism, and, after a 
protracted process, socialism will certainly supersede 
capitalism. This is an irreversible general trend in social 
development. But the road is full of twists and turns. In the 
several centuries that capitalism took to replace feudalism, 
were there not numerous restorations of monarchical rule? Thus, 
in a sense, temporary restorations are regular phenomena 
difficult to avoid. Some countries have suffered serious 
setbacks, and socialism has seemingly been weakened. But the 
people will have tempered themselves and drawn lessons from it 
and that will make socialism develop in a healthier direction. 
Therefore, there is no need to panic, to believe that Marxism is 
vanishing, that it has lost its value and is vanquished. 
Nothing of the sort! 
  Peace and development are the two major issues of the world, 
and neither one has been resolved. Socialist China should show 
the world through its deeds that it is opposed to hegemonism and 
power politics, and will never seek hegemony. China is a 
staunch force in safeguarding world peace. 
  We must push ahead along the road of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Capitalism has been developing for 
several centuries. The time we have spent on building socialism 
is quite short, not to mention the two decades we ourselves 
lost! It will be an extraordinary achievement if we build our 
country into a moderately developed country within a century 
starting from the founding of New China in 1949. The period 
from the present to the middle of next century is a crucial one. 
Let us immerse ourselves in hard work, as we are shouldering 
heavy burdens and bear major responsibility. 
NOTES: 
  1. In July 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China (CPC) and the State Council agreed to experiment 
with establishment of special export zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai 
and Shantou of Guangdong Province and Xiamen of Fujian Province. 
In May 1980, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
decided to rename the four as special economic zones. In August 
of the same year, the 15th Session of the Standing Committee of 
the Fifth National People's Congress approved Regulations 
Concerning the Special Economic Zones in Guangdong Province. 
This was followed by the successive establishment of these 
special economic zones. In 1984, Deng Xiaoping inspected the 
three zones at Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Xiamen. Aiming mainly at 
absorbing and utilizing foreign capital, the zones have adopted 
special economic policies and management systems. Their 
economic ownership system features a pluralistic structure 
dominated by socialist public ownership. Their economic 
activities are based on market regulation guided by state 
macroeconomic control. Foreign investment is facilitated by 
preferential treatment. The zones enjoy-comparatively greater 
rights of economic management. Prior to 1985, the four 
concentrated mainly on infrastructure construction in order to 
create a good investment environment. Starting from 1986, they 
strove to develop export-oriented economies based on industry 
and characterized by the combination of industry with foreign 
trade and the simultaneous promotion of agriculture, animal 
husbandry, fisheries and tourism. In April 1988, the First 
Session of the Seventh National People's Congress passed a 
resolution approving the designation of Hainan Island as the 
Hainan Special Economic Zone which implemented more flexible and 
open economic policies. The existing five special economic 
zones function as opening windows for China's socialist 
modernization drive. They also constitute trials of the 
nation's economic structural reforms. 
  2. When Hu Yaobang passed away on 15 April 1989, the public 
gave vent to their grief in various forms. During the mourning 
activities, a handful of people, with ulterior motives, 
concocted rumors to confuse and poison people's minds with 
demagogy. They used big and small character posters to slander 
and rail at the Party and state leaders, instigating opposition 
to Communist leadership and socialism. On April 26, Renmin 
Ribao (People's Daily) published an editorial entitled "A 
Clear-Cut Stand Must Be Taken Against Turmoil." The connivance 
and support by Zhao Ziyang, then general secretary of the CPC 
Central Committee, encouraged the turmoil. On May 13, the 
Beijing Autonomous Students Union, an illegal student 
organization, instigated the inception of a hunger strike by 
some individuals and occupied Tiananmen Square for a long 
period. To ensure social stability and restore normal order, 
the State Council decided to enforce martial law in part of 
Beijing from May 20. Taking advantage of the great restraint 
exercised by the government and the army, the organizers and 
plotters of the turbulence continued to occupy Tiananmen Square 
and organized various illegal activities. The unrest eventually 
developed into a counter-revolutionary riot. On June 4, the 
Party and government, relying on the people, adopted resolute 
measures and suppressed the counterrevolutionary riot. 
  3. The Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central 
Committee was held from November 25-29, 1991 in Beijing. The 
plenary session examined and passed the Decision of the CPC 
Central Committee on Further Strengthening Work in Agriculture 
and in Rural Areas. The session fully confirmed the Party's 
basic policies for rural areas and the great achievements of the 
rural reforms since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee. It emphasized that the household contract 
responsibility system should continue, along with improvements 
in the dual-level system which combines unified and independent 
management and unswerving deepening of rural reforms. The 
plenary session also examined and approved the Resolution on the 
Convening of the 14th CPC National Congress. 
  4. This refers to a self-employed individual in Wuhu City of 
Anhui Province who became rich through employing workers to 
process and sell melon seeds known as "idiot melon seeds." 
  5. The three kinds of ventures include Sino-foreign joint 
ventures, cooperative and solely foreign-owned enterprises. 
  6. After the CPC Central Committee convened a working 
conference in Chengdu in March 1958, an upsurge occurred to 
merge small agricultural cooperatives into big ones. It 
received affirmation and support from Mao Zedong. In August, 
they were named people's communes. In the same month, the CPC 
Central Committee held an enlarged meeting of the Political 
Bureau at Beidaihe which adopted the Resolution Setting Up 
People's Communes in the Rural Areas. Thus the people's communes 
were quickly set up throughout the country without undergoing 
any experimentation. Large in size and having a higher degree 
of public ownership than cooperatives, the communes integrated 
government administration and economic management and brought 
workers, peasants, merchants, students and soldiers together. 
Usually a township formed a commune but some counties also 
became communes. With their highly centralized management, the 
communes put the poor and the rich on an equal footing and 
introduced equitable distribution of wealth. Subsidiary 
production teams and even commune members were forced to hand 
over their property without compensation, stirring up a 
"communist wind" that spread unchecked across the country. 
After the winter of 1958, and in the spring of 1961 in 
particular, the CPC Central Committee and Mao Zedong made a 
series of policy demarcations in regard to people's communes and 
corrected some errors. However, the excessive centralization 
and egalitarianism existing in the people's communes lingered on 
posing a dilemma that restrained peasant initiative and rural 
productivity. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee, the system of the people's communes 
gradually changed under rural economic structural reforms. In 
October 1983, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
issued the Circular on Separating the Functions of Government 
from Commune Management and Establishing Township People's 
Government in line with stipulations in the Constitution of the 
People's Republic of China. The work was basically completed 
throughout the country by the end of 1984, indicating the demise 
of the people's communes in rural areas. 
  7. Here refers to the newly industrializing countries and 
regions -- Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Republic of 
Korea. Since the 1960s, they have been called the "four small 
dragons" of Asia because of the speedy economic growth. 
  8. In May 1958, the Second Session of the Eighth National 
Congress of the CPC formally adopted the general line of "going 
all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and 
more economical results in socialist construction." In the 
meantime, the Party rashly launched the "Great Leap Forward" 
movement. At first, unduly ambitious targets were set for 
agricultural production and newspapers advocated "high-yield 
satellites." In this atmosphere of boasting and hyperbole, the 
enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee convened in Beidaihe in August announced that steel 
output in 1958 would reach 10.7 million tons, double that of the 
previous year. After the gathering, an upsurge occurred in the 
nationwide movement to make steel. Similar movements also 
surged in industry, transportation, post and telecommunications, 
education, culture and public health undertakings. All were 
spurred on by the slogan "taking steel as the key link" and 
pushed the "Great Leap Forward" movement to a climax. "Left" 
errors marked by overly high targets, issuing of arbitrary 
direction, bragging and exaggeration spread unchecked, 
disrupting normal economic construction orders, wasting large 
amount of manpower and resources and causing serious 
disproportion in the national economy. 
  9. Qian Xuesen was born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, in 
1911. He went to study in the United States in 1935 and returned 
to China in 1955. He joined the Communist Party of China in 
1958 and subsequently held such posts as director of the 
Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
vice-minister of the No. 7 Ministry of Machine-Building 
Industry, vice-minister of the State Commission of Science, 
Technology and Industry for National Defence, and chairman of 
the China Association for Science and Technology. He was also 
an alternate member of the ninth to 12th CPC Central Committee. 
Qian directly participated in and organized China's study and 
experimentation on carrier rockets, missiles and satellites, 
making outstanding contributions to China's spaceflight 
endeavors. 
  10. Li Siguang (1889-1971) was born in Huanggang, Hubei 
Province. He studied in Japan and Britain and was a university 
professor and member of the Central Research Academy. He 
visited Europe in 1948, and returned to China in the following 
year. Li joined the Communist Party of China in 1958 and held 
such posts as director of the Institute of Palaeontology of the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, vice-president of the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences, minister of geology, and chairman of the 
China Association for Science and Technology. He was also a 
member of the Ninth CPC Central Committee. All his life, Li 
studied and taught palaeontology, glaciology, seismology and 
geomechanics. As a pioneer of geomechanics, Li made outstanding 
contributions to China's petroleum prospecting. 
  11. Qian Sanqiang (1913-92), whose ancestral home was in 
Wuxing (present-day Huzhou) of Zhejiang Province, was born in 
Shaoxing. He went to study in France in 1937 and returned to 
China in 1948. Qian joined the Communist Party of China in 1954 
and held such posts as director of the Institute of Modern 
Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, vice-minister of the 
No. 2 Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, vice-president of 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences and honorary chairman of the 
China Association for Science and Technology. He made 
outstanding contributions to the founding of China's atomic 
energy sciences and the development of atomic and hydrogen bombs. 
  12. The Sixth Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee 
of the CPC was held in Beijing on 28 September 1981. The 
session adopted the Resolution of the Central Committee of the 
Chinese Communist Party on the Guiding Principles for Building a 
Socialist Society With an Advanced Culture and Ideology. In 
discussing the draft of this resolution, Deng Xiaoping delivered 
an important speech on opposing bourgeois liberalization.

<F P=106> [Article by WEN HUI BAO reporter Tai Hengji (3141 1854 </F>
7535): "Shanghai To Implement Seven Financial Reforms in 1994" 
-- First paragraph is WEN HUI BAO introduction] 
  [Text] We will introduce the market mechanism and 
energetically cultivate and develop the financial market; truly 
manage the state-owned commercial banks as ones which operate 
according to the mechanism of business management of modern 
commercial banks; actively stabilize and develop the system of 
cooperative banks; and open wider to the outside world in 
financial affairs. 
  Mao Yingliang, director of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of 
the People's Bank of China, said yesterday that Shanghai's 
financial circles must quicken its tempo in deepening the reform 
of the financial system. He expressed his views on Shanghai's 
financial reform for the next year. 
  Mao Yingliang was interviewed yesterday right after he 
attended the class for leading cadres in Shanghai to study 
Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Through 
the study of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the 
cadres in Shanghai's financial circles have deepened their 
understanding of the remarks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping who 
said: "When a single move of chess is lively, the whole game of 
chess becomes lively. This applies to the financial affairs" and 
"Shanghai has gained international standing in financial 
affairs. First of all, we must rely on Shanghai." Meanwhile, 
remarkable achievements have been attained in implementing the 
measures laid down by the central authorities on exercising 
macroeconomic control. All this has provided Shanghai with 
conditions to deepen Shanghai's financial reform in ideology and 
in practice. 
  First of all, Mao Yingliang analyzed the current financial 
situation in Shanghai. He pointed out that after exercising the 
macroeconomic control, Shanghai's financial order in Shanghai 
has been stabilized and its business operation becomes normal. 
The amount of bank deposits and loans is increasing on a large 
scale. The financial market remains active and opens wider to 
the outside world. All this supports the sustained, rapid and 
healthy development of Shanghai's economy. By the end of 
November, the total amount of deposits of all types in Shanghai 
was increased by 33.8 billion yuan over that in the same period 
at the end of the last year, marking a growth of 9.08 billion 
yuan as compared with that in the corresponding period in the 
previous year. There is a regular increase of saving deposits. 
As compared with the end of the last year, the amount of savings 
deposits rose by 13.5 billion yuan, more than 90 percent of 
which were fixed-term deposits. The amount of deposits from 
government enterprises also sharply rose. With the amount of 
deposits increasing, there is a steady rate of growth in loans. 
The funds are being used on all major construction projects in 
support of the economic development in Shanghai. Various 
specialized banks turn over 9.8 percent of their deposits to the 
central bank as reserve requirements, 4 percent more than that 
before the macro-economic control and higher than what they are 
required to do. The financial market is unprecedentedly active. 
The annual volume of business on the security market is expected 
to reach 500 billion yuan; the total amount of foreign exchange 
that change hands on the swap market may exceed U.S.$4 billion; 
and the total amount of inter-bank loans will reach 210 billion 
yuan. The balance of inter-bank exchange remains normal, the 
rate on the swap market is basically stable, and the situation 
in the returns of money is fine. Mao Yingliang believed that the 
measures adopted by the central authorities in exercising the 
macroeconomic control has brought stability and prosperity to 
Shanghai's financial circles and created a good environment for 
further deepening the financial reform for the next year. 
  On the financial reform for the next year, Mao Yingliang put 
forward the following seven tasks on the basis of the principle 
of emancipating our thinking and seeking truth from facts: 
  1. We must introduce the market mechanism to energetically 
cultivate and develop the financial market. Foreign exchange, 
money, securities and gold markets should be further expanded 
and developed. Efforts must be made in establishing the center 
for foreign exchange of China. This center located at No 15 Bund 
in Shanghai is now under construction. It is expected to go into 
operation in early 1994. This is a large, nation-wide market. It 
is necessary to make use of this market to form a national 
unified foreign exchange market and a nation-wide system for a 
unified foreign exchange rate. Meanwhile, it is essential to 
unify foreign exchange rates in coordination with the reform in 
foreign exchange system and to lay a foundation for the 
internationalization of our currencies. Efforts must be made to 
improve the money markets including the short-term national 
bonds market, the inter-bank loan market and the discount 
market; and exercise macro-economic control with open market 
operations. It is essential to further improve the securities 
market and enterprise management system, and optimize the 
allocation of resources. Currently, the Shanghai securities 
market has basically become the national business center in this 
connection. During the next year, it will further expand 
business and promote standardization. Efforts should be made to 
build a gold market according to international standards. During 
the last year, more than 10 tons of gold jewelry were sold in 
Shanghai. The sale of such gold jewelry is expected to exceed 20 
tons this year. We must study how to increase transactions in 
gold bullions and gold certificates. 
  2. We must truly turn state commercial banks into ones which 
operate like modern commercial banks. First, efforts must be 
made to help specialized banks separate the existing 
policy-lending business from commercial lending business and 
engage in the management of the proportions of assets and 
liabilities and in management of risks. They must be helped to 
develop a mechanism of assuming responsibilities for their own 
business management, their own risks, profits and losses, and in 
restraining and developing themselves. It is imperative to help 
the existing commercial banks develop a mechanism to operate 
like genuine commercial banks. They must be allowed to compete, 
and their businesses be permitted to overlap with one another. 
  3. We must actively and steadily develop the system of 
cooperative banks and establish rural and urban cooperative 
banks. Urban cooperative banks must be established on the basis 
of the 99 existing urban credit cooperatives. They should serve 
the small- and medium-sized enterprises and render regional 
economic services. Urban cooperative banks should operate at 
the grassroots and the city level. All of them enjoy their 
status as independent legal persons. Rural cooperative banks 
should be established on the basis of existing rural credit 
cooperatives. State commercial banks may hold shares of rural 
cooperative banks, but may not change the latter's 
characteristics in cooperating with each other on a collective 
basis. 
  4. It is necessary to open wider to the outside world in 
financial affairs, and welcome more foreign-funded banks to open 
up their branches in Shanghai. We hope that the number of 
branches of foreign banks will reach 50 in 1995. Foreign-funded 
banks are welcome to move their regional head offices or their 
head offices in China to Shanghai. We must strive to carry out 
experiments in allowing a limited number of foreign-funded 
financial institutions to do business in renminbi. 
  5. It is imperative to popularize the use of computers in 
financial operations. During the next year, we must set up a 
credit card network and use computers for local check clearance. 
  6. We must blaze new trails in improving ways in handling 
financial affairs including business in offshore financing, 
mortgage loans, and others. It is necessary to develop real 
estate financing business in close connection with housing 
reform. 
  7. We must strengthen the macroeconomic control in financial 
affairs. The central bank must strengthen its financial 
supervision and auditing and further standardize the procedure 
in handling financial affairs. Particular efforts must be made 
to change from direct control to effective indirect control by 
improving the market mechanism.

"Shanghai's Eight Trade Markets Advance Toward Maturity"] 
  [Text} A large setup of markets in Shanghai is gradually 
taking shape, covering the whole country and linking up the 
world. Within a period of a year and half, Shanghai has built a 
total of eight major trade markets for metal, coal, agricultural 
supplies, chemicals, petroleum, grain and edible oil, motor cars 
and building materials. During the first 11 months this year, 
the volume of business of the eight major markets exceeded 370 
billion yuan. The past practice of the state allocating the 
essential factors of production has been changed. This change 
lays a solid foundation to establish a socialist market economic 
structure in Shanghai. 
  A major standardized market is one of the distinctive 
features of the new market economy. From the very beginning, 
the eight major markets in Shanghai put to an end the abnormal 
phenomenon of linking authority with economic interests. Various 
major markets have invariably set up a mechanism of open and 
fair market competition. During business transactions, everyone 
is treated equally. All price competitions are open, whether 
customers are new or old and personal relations are close or 
not. The metal market in Shanghai sold and bought 17.73 million 
tons of metal of all types between January and November this 
year with the total volume of business exceeding 320 billion 
yuan. This has objectively reflected the demands on the domestic 
market and the changes on the international market. The metal 
market has fulfilled its targets much earlier than the spot 
markets in various localities in the country. Therefore, the 
prices on the metal market in Shanghai has replaced the prices 
set by the state for many years and become the most 
authoritative prices for the selling and buying of ferrous metal 
in the country. The standardized major markets truly reflect 
the law of value and the relations between supply and demand. 
The eight major markets implement the system of cash deposit and 
that of punishment for breach of contracts. Members and units 
that do businesses on the markets value their credit a great 
deal and the rate of fulfilling contracts on various markets is 
considerably high. The volume of business on the metal market 
exceeded 320 billion yuan, and the rate of contract fulfillment 
reached 100 percent. 
  The eight major markets in Shanghai are diversified in doing 
their businesses. The major categories of their businesses 
embrace major means of production in the three major industries 
in support of the national economy -- industry, agriculture and 
energy. Member units that are doing businesses on the eight 
major markets include "state groups," large production 
enterprises, enterprises in the realm of circulation and end-use 
units as well as newly emerging trading companies and even 
individual private-owned enterprises. As for the form of 
business, there are futures contracts like the one signed by the 
Shanghai Metal Exchange Market for No. 1 electrolytic copper, 
cash transactions and medium- and long-term contracts. Each of 
the eight major markets has its own special feature and 
attractions. Their operation is diversified, orderly and 
standardized. 
  Shanghai and the relevant ministries and commissions of the 
state have established the eight major trade markets in an 
effort to help China's economy gradually become world-oriented. 
Therefore, while trading products that are either have long been 
available on the world market, or are just beginning to appear 
on the world market, the various existing trade markets in 
Shanghai have tried hard to carry out their operations according 
to international practice in order to embark in international 
business. The metal trade market, petroleum trade market and 
the grain and edible oil trade market in Shanghai already have 
access to the REUTER IDN International high-speed network, and 
they are able to simultaneously receive the latest information 
from various large trade centers in the world. Meanwhile, they 
are also able to transmit the market information from Shanghai 
to various trade centers in the world through computer terminals 
and networks. Various trade markets in Shanghai have also 
established close connections with famous trade centers in the 
United States, Britain and other nations, and invited foreign 
experts to come to China to pass on their knowledge and train 
personnel. They also send people abroad to carry out 
investigations and studies, and draw on the experience in 
foreign countries on the development of the futures market. Some 
foreign bankers believe that these trade markets in Shanghai 
have started early and are rapidly maturing. They will have a 
far-reaching impact on the establishment and development of the 
mechanism of market economy.

Branch, the People's Bank of China: "Serious Losses of Budgetary 
Funds"] 
  [Text] A new and quite worrisome problem has arisen in 
China's public finance, namely the retardation in several 
regions of budgetary income increases, a fact which has most 
seriously aggravated the difficulties of public finance, so that 
even the normal allocation of funds for wages has become 
difficult in certain administrative units. In marked contrast to 
this situation, extrabudgetary funds have substantially 
increased yearly, and are showing a tendency toward large-scale 
inflation. In our search for reasons, we found that serious 
losses are being incurred in the budgetary income of public 
finance, and our investigations have revealed that there are the 
following eight channels which are allowing budgetary funds to 
be diverted to become extrabudgetary funds. 
  First channel: Diversions put in place through public 
finance 
budgets. Public finance is presently practicing a system of 
separate administrative responsibilities, referred to as 
"preparing one's own meals at separate kitchens." When preparing 
their annual financial budgets, some regions will therefore try 
to promote local economic developments and build up financial 
resources by making appropriate provisions in their budgets for 
"special-purpose funds" to support production. As we understand, 
most of these funds are allocated out in the form of revolving 
funds by the business departments of the public finance 
agencies, without providing for reimbursements, from budgetary 
accounts to extrabudgetary accounts, and are left deposited 
there. In the process of transferring these funds to the 
extrabudgetary deposits and allocating them for payment, it 
happens quite frequently that the business departments within 
the public finance agencies at every level retain some of these 
funds and divert them for other purposes. This, then, is a way 
of turning budgetary funds into extrabudgetary funds. 
  Second channel: Diversion through financial credits. 
Financial credit is one form by which public finance agencies 
use capital funds by means of fudiciary bank loans. In recent 
years, there has been an increase in the locally retained funds, 
and as a consequence, financial credit activities have also 
expanded. Some public finance agencies are utilizing 
intermittently available budgetary or surplus funds, on the 
pretext of supporting production, and either directly loan such 
funds out on budgetary accounts or employ an agency pattern in 
extending loans. Some also invest the funds as shares in 
enterprises, starting up all kinds of fiduciary loan activities, 
and collecting "fund-occupancy" or "fund-use" fees. 
  Third channel: Diversion of income earned by administrative 
business units by not turning over such income to the state 
treasury. Income from administrative business units is an 
important source of budgetary revenue of public finance. 
However, in recent years, some units that earn budgetary income 
use various kinds of pretexts for remitting less than due, or 
for not remitting at all, income that should be paid into the 
state treasury. Particularly serious are the cases of units 
which themselves collect such revenue and spend it all by 
themselves. They thus retain the total amount of such income and 
turn these funds, that should have been administered within the 
budget, into their own small money-chests and their own small 
treasuries, and in this way provide the monetary resources for 
unhealthy tendencies. 
  Fourth channel: diversion by not turning over to the 
treasury 
fines and confiscated funds collected by the state's law 
enforcement agencies. Following more effective law enforcement, 
income from fines and confiscated funds, collected by the law 
enforcement agencies in the course of the performance of their 
duties of exercising state controls, have increased yearly. 
According to regulations, fines and confiscated funds must be 
paid into the state treasury in full, while expenses incurred 
during the investigation of the cases in question shall be 
allocated and paid out of the budget of public finance, thus 
collection and expenditures shall be two separate operations. 
However, in actual fact, implementation of this rule is 
difficult. Quite a number of units use as an excuse the fact 
that circumstances had been exceptional, and that no money had 
been available to investigate the cases, to make out that 
revenue and expenditure have evened out. They will spend the 
money as they please, and budgetary income funds will thus be 
retained and misused for other purposes. 
  Fifth channel: diversion by dispersions and retentions 
carried out by agencies in charge of finance, taxation, and the 
imposition of levies. Investigations revealed that some agencies 
in charge of finance, taxation, and the imposition of levies had 
opened special accounts, or rather, arbitrarily opened accounts, 
with various banks and urban or rural credit cooperatives with 
the intention of retaining budgetary revenue and willfully 
diverting the money to other uses. These activities have assumed 
serious dimensions. Especially some basic-level units in charge 
of finance, taxation, and the imposition of levies do not 
administer affairs according to the provisions governing state 
treasury administration. They do not promptly report and hand 
over the full amounts of budgetary revenue, but will, without 
authority, divert the budgetary revenue to other purposes or 
privately deposit public funds with the intention of making 
private profits for themselves or for their group. Particularly 
serious are the cases where they act in complete disregard for 
party discipline and state law by willfully and arbitrarily 
misappropriating funds that belong to the state treasury. 
  Sixth channel: diversion by public finance agencies setting 
up economic entities. During the last two years, public finance 
agencies of various ranks have set up a large number of economic 
entities, and, for the purpose of providing these economic 
entities with the needed funds for running expenses, also as 
capital and operating funds, some agencies in charge of public 
finance have financed these economic entities with budgetary 
funds in such forms as allocations from budgetary accounts, or 
loans, or by taking up shares in these entities. A part of the 
budgetary funds was thereby converted into funds owned by the 
subordinate economic entity. 
  Seventh channel: diversions by finance and tax agencies 
refunding paid-in budget revenue and refunding taxes. Taxes and 
profits from enterprise units figure large in the budgetary 
revenue of state finance. However, some districts merely take 
their partial and local benefits into consideration, will 
disregard the state's laws and regulations concerning public 
finance, will concoct all kinds of pretexts, use a great variety 
of forms, and will, in an arbitrary excess of their powers, 
reduce taxes, refund taxes, and refund paid-in budget revenue. 
They will, in particular, arbitrarily refund or reduce budgetary 
revenue of the central government and revenue that belongs to 
both, the local as well as the central government. In the 
administration of budgetary revenue, there is also the problem 
that the agency in charge of administering the state treasury 
does not conscientiously carry out its official duties. In such 
specific accounting processes as reporting and paying the proper 
proportions in tax categories and tax items as pertaining to the 
central government or the local governments, investigations and 
checks are not strict. This too is responsible for diversion of 
a part of the budgetary revenue, converting it from central 
government to local government budgetary revenue, or to 
extrabudgetary funds of enterprise units. 
  Eighth channel: diversion by enterprises cutting down on 
payments to the treasury and claiming higher costs. When drawing 
various special-purpose funds, some enterprise units will 
arbitrarily expand the scope of the project and raise 
significant proportions and criteria. For instance, when drawing 
funds for the depreciation of fixes assets, they will shorten 
the service life and claim depreciation before its proper date. 
They will cut down on payments to the treasury and will use the 
money for their own purposes, and they will increase cost 
expenditure. By doing so they will correspondingly reduce 
enterprise profits and taxes, and expand the source of 
extrabudgetary funds of their own enterprise units. 
  To bring about a radical solution of the serious problems of 
the above-mentioned conversion of budgetary funds to 
extrabudgetary funds and to stop up loopholes, it is my opinion 
that it is necessary to actively push on with the structural 
reform of the finance system with a separate taxation system, 
that we straighten out the distribution relations between 
central government and local governments, increasingly 
promulgate laws and regulation, as soon as possible produce a 
law on budgeting, enhance the work at the state treasury, fully 
bring into play supervisory and administrative functions of the 
agency in charge of the state treasury, and effectively check 
the administration of the state treasury and close loopholes.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Guoguang (0491 0948 0342): "Several Problems </F>
in Finance and Banking Reform"] 
  [Text] Concerned about conspicuous problems and 
incongruities in the operation of the country's economy -- 
particularly in the finance and banking field -- during the past 
several months, the central authorities have taken a series of 
actions to improve macroeconomic regulation and control, 
principal of which has been rectification of finance and 
banking. These actions show initial results in the form of a 
preliminary cooling of the overheated economy and the beginning 
of a readjustment of the overly confused finance and banking 
order. Nevertheless, a fundamental turn around of the disarray 
in the finance and banking order and laxity in finance and 
banking discipline requires full reform of the economic system. 
Specifically it requires pervasive reform of the finance and 
banking system. 
<H3>  I. Finance and Banking System Reform Holds an Extremely 
Important Position in Overall Economic System Reform </H3>
  China's economy has developed rapidly as a result of more 
than a decade of reform and opening up to the outside world. The 
economic system has also undergone profound changes, one 
evidence of which is the increasingly important position and the 
increasingly marked role of finance and banking in the overall 
operation of the national economy. As the country's national 
income distribution structure, national savings structure, and 
investment and financing structure change, and as the degree of 
commercialization, monetarization, and use of credit in the 
economy became greater and greater, the finance and banking 
sector has become the main channel for raising capital, for 
financing, and for distributing funds in society. It has become 
the main supplier of construction funds in society. Today, a 
substantial percentage of funds invested in fixed assets 
throughout society come from the finance and banking sector, and 
more than 90 percent of enterprises' working capital comes from 
the finance and banking sector. During the past several years, 
the absolute figure increase in bank credit each year has 
greatly exceeded fiscal expenditures for economic construction. 
The finance and banking sector has made an outstanding 
contribution to development of the national economy. At the same 
time, finance and banking has become the main means of 
regulating the movement of currency and capital (value). It has 
become the most important hub for the country's macroeconomic 
regulation and control. Through currency and credit policies, 
and the use of both direct and indirect regulation and control 
measures, including the scale of credit, relending, savings 
reserve funds, interest rates, and exchange rates, the state has 
regulated total social demand, has striven to keep the currency 
stable, and has spurred coordinated development of the national 
economy. One study shows that virtually all the economic 
fluctuations of the economy during the past several years have 
resulted from fiscal and financial policy regulation, and that 
financial policy has played a more important role than fiscal 
policy. One might say that after more than a decade of reform, 
the position of accountant for plan and cashier for government 
finance that the finance and banking system occupied under the 
traditional system has changed fundamentally. Finance and 
banking policy and its macroeconomic regulation and control 
effect have become of greater and greater decisive importance. 
  It is because of reform that the importance of finance and 
banking in the national economy has become greater and greater. 
Therefore, the important position of finance and banking system 
reform in overall economic system reform has increasingly 
aroused a high degree of serious attention and widespread 
concern. In many important ways, however, finance and banking 
system reform has advanced with difficulty. This difficulty has 
become a major impediment to progress in reform of 
macromanagement and reform of the economy as a whole. Progress 
in finance and banking system reform directly influences and 
limits progress in overall economic system reform. 
  Truly, with the intensification of economic reform and 
widening of the opening up to the outside world during the past 
14 years, quite a few achievements have been made in financial 
system reform. Today's finance and banking system has changed 
quite markedly from the traditional system. A finance and 
banking system has taken shape in which the Chinese People's 
Bank plays the leading role, the national banks are the main 
entities, and finance and banking institutions of various kinds 
exist together, and in which the division of labor is 
coordinated. A financial macroeconomic regulation and control 
system has been preliminarily built that applies economic, 
administrative, and legal means to control finance and banking. 
Financial markets dominated by lending markets and national bond 
markets have begun to form. Financial opening up to the outside 
world is expanding steadily. Nevertheless, since finance and 
banking cover a wide area, which makes for great difficulty in 
reform, progress in reforming the financial system is still 
fairly slow. Reform has yet to make real headway on some 
pervasive and fundamental problems. The finance and banking 
system is unable to meet needs for development of a socialist 
market economy. This shows up mostly in the following ways: The 
Chinese People's Bank has not yet become a true central bank. 
Macroeconomic regulation and control of finance and banking is 
feeble. China's specialized banks handle both routine commercial 
business and transactions made for policy reasons. Thus, they 
cannot become true finance and banking enterprises. The entire 
banking system lacks competitiveness and vitality. Financial 
markets lack standardization. Cutting up of markets and mutual 
market blockading are serious problems. Effective supervision 
and control are lacking. Financial regulation and control 
methods, including the regulation and control of interest rates, 
retain a strong administrative fiat coloration. These problems 
impair implementation of national macroeconomic policies, and 
they hamper the further intensification of economic reform and 
healthy development of the national economy. 
  Therefore, acceleration of financial system reform, and 
increasing the intensity of financial system reform in order to 
spur broad and in-depth economic system reform have become 
problems currently in need of urgent solution. But in what 
direction should finance and banking system reform be 
intensified? To meet the needs of a socialist market economy, as 
well as to solve deep-seated problems in the country's finance 
and banking realm, the basic goals of China's finance and 
banking system reform should be as follows: 1) Amplification of 
the basic functions of the Chinese People's Bank to build a 
strong central bank regulation and control system that 
independently executes monetary policy; 2) separation of 
financing for policy reasons from financing of a commercial 
nature to build a finance and banking system in which 
state-owned commercial banks are the main entity, and various 
kinds of finance and banking institutions exist at the same 
time; 3) standardization of financial market operation to build 
a financial market system that is uniformly open, has orderly 
competition, and is strictly controlled; and 4) straightening 
out of different interest rates to build a capital pricing 
system founded on the central bank interest rate. 
<H3>  II. Amplification of Chinese People's Bank's Basic Functions 
To Build a Strong Central Bank Regulation and Control System 
That Independently Executes Monetary Policy </H3>
  As the nation's central bank, the Chinese People's Bank 
should faithfully discharge its basic functions like central 
banks elsewhere throughout the world. On the one hand, it should 
independently draw up and execute (implement) monetary policy, 
apply various means, control the currency supply, regulate 
currency demand, guard against inflation, and maintain the 
stability of the currency and the entire macroeconomy. On the 
other hand, it should strictly control and supervise finance and 
banking institutions, employing policies and laws to regularize 
all finance and banking activities to ensure that finance and 
banking institutions operate in a healthy and secure way. 
  Although the Chinese People's Bank nominally became 
responsible in 1984 for performing the functions of a central 
bank, it is still a very long way from meeting the standards and 
requirements of a true central bank. This shows up prominently 
in the following ways: First, the People's Bank continues to 
engage in day-to-day financial activities such as handling 
special loans for economic and technical development, loans for 
the old, the young, and for people living in border regions or 
impoverished areas, loans to assist the needy, and loans for 
gold production. This often mires it in irksome routine currency 
credit matters, which impedes completion of its basic functions. 
Second, since the government also checks on the profitability of 
the People's Bank, instituting a profit retention system for the 
bank, the People's Bank and its branches and sub-branches are 
strongly motivated to make a profit by running all kinds of 
businesses that compete for profit with the "civilian sector." 
Thus, the bank loses its detached position. Third, the Chinese 
People's Bank is subject to too much administrative interference 
from top to bottom. It lacks the independence it should have. 
For example, the central government frequently overdraws and 
borrows from the People's Bank. In particular, the strong 
influence and interference of local governments at all levels on 
People's Bank branches and sub-branches (that is, the so-called 
"localization of central bank actions") seriously impair the 
People's Bank's performance of its functions. Fourth, the 
People's Bank's macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism 
is deficient. It lacks effective means of regulation and 
control. Fifth, the People's Bank lacks sufficient independence 
in the drafting and execution of monetary policy. The twin goals 
of "developing the economy and stabilizing the currency" 
frequently mean that the People's Bank must passively meet the 
needs of "economic development"; thus, it is unable to attain 
the goal of "stabilizing the currency." (Examples include the 
several bouts of inflation that have occurred during the past 
more than a decade). Sixth, the People's Bank lacks effective 
supervision and control over financial activities throughout the 
country. This is also an important reason for the current 
disarray in the financial order and the laxness of financial 
discipline. 
  Therefore, the principal goal and task of Chinese finance 
and 
banking system reform is to make the People's Bank into a real 
central bank in fact as well as in name, using this as a basis 
for the founding of a strong central bank regulation and control 
system that independently executes monetary policy. This being 
the requirement, problems in the following several regards must 
now be solved properly: 
  1. Draw up laws and regulations that clearly specify the 
functions of the People's Bank to regulate its conduct. As the 
authoritative institution for state financial control, the most 
important task of the People's Bank is to carry out national 
monetary policy, to control the issuance of currency, to 
regulate currency supply, and to ensure implementation and 
exercise of a uniform monetary policy throughout the country. As 
the bank's bank, or the "ultimate lender," the People's Bank 
should generally provide finance capital only for the head 
offices of national commercial banks. It should not engage in 
day-to-day financial business or business of a commercial 
nature. As current agencies of the head office of the People's 
Bank, branches and sub-branches at the provincial (or municipal 
and autonomous region) level or below should no longer handle 
the routine issuance of credit, or the scale of credit 
readjustments. Instead, it should shift its work emphasis to 
greater financial supervision and control, financial 
investigation and statistical research, management of the 
national treasury, affiliated bank settlement of accounts, and 
foreign exchange control. 
  2. Straighten out relations between government finance and 
the banks, putting an end to the correlation between fiscal 
deficits and currency issuance to begin to build a macroeconomic 
mechanism of mutual coordination and mutual checks and balances 
between the People's Bank and public finance. Since the advent 
of reform, disarray in the fiscal and financial systems, and the 
mixing of fiscal and banking functions has been extremely 
serious. This has shown up most prominently in a matter that has 
already attracted notice, namely "forced nationalization of 
credit funds" (such as huge government overdrafts on and loans 
from the People's Bank, and the banks bearing responsibility for 
disbursements that the government should make but does not make, 
or compensation that the government should pay but does not pay. 
It has also appeared in bank issuance of so-called 
"stabilization and unity loans" and government initiative in 
making government loans" (such as fiscal units' use of the 
intermittent funds within budget and funds they control outside 
of budget to set up government financial credit institutions and 
to found various kinds of development corporations. 
Alternatively, government directly invests in various local 
corporations, or plays a direct role in financial activities 
such as the buying and selling of negotiable securities, real 
estate development, trusts, and leasing). The damage this causes 
is rather severe. The main way to straighten out relations 
between government finance and the People's Bank lies in 
legislation that prohibits the government from borrowing or 
overdrawing funds from the People's Bank, the government solving 
its problem of a shortage of funds resulting from making 
pay-outs before obtaining receipts through the issuance of 
short-term government bonds. Government deficits must be made up 
through the issuance of medium and long-term government bonds. 
At the same time, the People's Bank should increase its 
regulation and control of the basic money supply, and maintain a 
high degree of funds liquidity. It should use the market 
mechanism to take money out of and put money into circulation as 
economic development places demands on the money supply. Yet 
another point must be raised in connection with the relationship 
between banks and government finance, and that is the need for 
earliest possible elimination of the profit retention system and 
the system for the surrender of tax receipts by the People's 
Bank and its branches and sub-branches. A People's Bank 
independent financial budgeting and control system should be set 
up instead, all profits that the People's Bank realizes being 
paid to the central government treasury, and all of its losses 
being borne by the central government treasury. 
  3. Increase the independence of the central bank. The 
central 
bank independence issue is an issue of the relationship between 
the central bank and the government. Because of differences in 
economic development and the evolution of the central bank in 
separate countries, the independence of the central bank in the 
exercise of functions and powers is not the same in different 
countries of the world today. In the United States, Germany, and 
Sweden, the central bank is very independent. It is not 
responsible to the government, but to the legislative body. Its 
leaders are not members of the cabinet, and its policies are 
generally free from government interference. In the United 
Kingdom, Japan, and France, the central bank is subordinate to 
the government; however, in the drafting and implementation of 
financial policies, it maintains substantial independence. In 
most of these countries, a fairly detached policymaking 
organization is set up within the central bank. Examples include 
the board of directors of the Bank of England, the policy 
committee of the Bank of Japan, and the National Credit 
Committee of the Bank of France. Why should the central bank be 
largely independent? The main reason is that governments 
generally have a pronounced short-term attitude. They frequently 
place too much emphasis on short-term economic growth, attaching 
more importance to it than to currency stability. If the central 
bank is largely independent, it can avoid such a tilt, 
effectively carry out monetary policy, and ensure currency and 
price stability, thereby creating conditions for long-term, 
stable economic growth. Generally, the countries in which the 
central bank is largely independent are also the ones in which 
the currency is stable and the economy is rather well-developed. 
As the nation's central bank, the People's Bank should be 
substantially independent. The government should ensure that the 
People's Bank has the authority and the responsibility to 
conduct an independent monetary policy. It should have the 
authority to regulate currency circulation to ensure that the 
basic stability of the renminbi. Under the present circumstances 
in China, the People's Bank implementation of monetary policy 
under leadership of the State Council helps bolster central bank 
macroeconomic regulation and control for better and faster 
development of the nation's economy. As China's market economy 
develops, and as the central bank matures and improves, 
practical experiences will have to be summarized and a decision 
made on the basis of actual circumstances as to whether the 
People's Bank's current subordination requires readjustment or 
change. In addition, in order to avoid People's Bank branches 
and sub-branches being subjected to local government 
interference, the approach of setting up People's Bank branches 
and sub-branches in key cities, that is, a transregional set-up, 
may be explored and tried out to set the stage for 
implementation of a central bank uniform currency policy. 
  4. Perfect the People's Bank's regulation and control 
mechanism. The ultimate goal of the central bank's currency 
policy is to keep the currency stable in order to advance 
economic development. In addition, as the market economy shifts 
into high gear, going from no development to development, the 
People's Bank will have to change from mostly direct to mostly 
indirect methods of regulation and control. Under present 
conditions, the state must be prepared for active trial, reform, 
and perfection of the People's Bank's indirect ways and means of 
regulation and control. This includes the gradual setting of 
interest rates by the market, gradual institution of a 
multi-tier savings reserve system, expansion of rediscounting, 
and trial operation of open market business. Along with this 
must be speedy establishment of a People's Bank investigation 
and study information system, and the perfection of a People's 
Bank system for preparing statistics, analyzing, and forecasting 
currency supply and the entire macroeconomy to provide 
scientific data for the formulation of monetary policy. 
  5. Better People's Bank supervision and control of monetary 
policy implementation, financial market operations, and 
financial institutions' actions for the building of a normal 
financial order. This requires, first of all, paying close 
attention to the drafting and perfecting of financial laws and 
regulations, including the drafting of a "Central Bank Law," a 
"Commercial Bank Law," a "Negotiable Instruments Law," and an 
"Insurance Law" to provide guidelines for financial operations, 
and laws on which the People Bank can rely to exercise 
supervision and control. In addition, the People's Bank must 
increase its auditing and supervisory forces, improve its 
auditing and supervisory skills, and exercise strict supervision 
and control over both banks and non-banking financial 
institutions to ensure healthy and orderly finance and banking 
activities in the country, control of the country's finance and 
banking being regulated according to law. 
  It must be pointed out that in the process of changing from 
a 
planned economy to a market economy, making the People's Bank 
regulation and control system sound, and perfecting its 
regulation and control mechanism is also a gradual, step-by-step 
process that cannot be done in haste. Furthermore, in this 
process, finance and banking activities and conduct may also 
exhibit a very marked transitional coloration. For example, when 
conditions do not exist for the implementation of indirect 
financial regulation and control means or for them to play a 
role, traditional direct financial regulation and control 
methods (such as the use of caps on credit) may have to be 
retained for a period. In short, we must proceed from actual 
conditions and circumstances in the transformation of the 
People's Bank's functions and the building of a new central bank 
regulation and control system, and avoid the creation of 
"vacuums" and loopholes in the macroregulation and control of 
finance and banking that may lead to loss of macroeconomic 
control. 
<H3>  III. Separation of Policy Financing From Commercial 
Financing To Build a Financial System in Which State-Owned 
Commercial Banks Are the Main Entities With Many Kinds of 
Financial Institutions Existing at the Same Time </H3>
  Thanks to more than a decade of reform, China's finance and 
banking system has undergone very many changes. The traditional 
banking system characterized primarily by "great uniformity" has 
given way to the current banking system in which many kinds of 
finance and banking institutions exist at the same time, 
including the four major specialized banks, nearly 10 regional 
commercial banks, a number of insurance companies, trust 
investment corporations, negotiable securities corporations, 
finance companies, and rural and urban credit cooperatives. 
  The current finance and banking system is still incomplete, 
not soundly based, and contains numerous problems, principals of 
which are the following: 
  1) The specialized banks combine two functions in a single 
body, namely, they handle both business done for policy reasons 
and commercial transactions. This combining in a single body of 
two kinds of business is bound to produce a blurring of the 
character, the functions, and the responsibilities of the 
specialized banks, and create confusion in their actions. When 
called upon to do business of a policy nature, they usually 
emphasize that they are "commercial banks," and they stress 
their autonomy and their interests. When called upon to act as 
commercial banks, and to seek to maintain funds in balance, they 
frequently emphasize that they are policy banks. The result is 
to put themselves in position to gain both the favored treatment 
accorded for performance of policy functions and the rights of 
finance and banking enterprises while shouldering neither the 
duties of policy banks nor the responsibilities of financial 
enterprises. In fact, because the two kinds of business are 
bundled together, the specialized banks are frequently subjected 
to control from a higher level and from local governments. This 
makes it difficult for them to become economic entities that 
make their own operating decisions, that are responsible for 
their own profits and losses, that bear their own risks, and 
that exercise self-restraint. Such a system does not facilitate 
central bank macroeconomic regulation and control. (For example, 
impelled by the administrative interference of local governments 
and their own interests, the specialized banks frequently divert 
to the development of local industry funds that are intended for 
policy purposes such as the procurement of agricultural and 
sideline products. Meanwhile, they blame the central bank for 
the shortage of credit, thereby forcing the central bank to 
expand the issuance of currency). Nor does this system 
facilitate smooth implementation of national industrial 
policies. (Acting out of their own interests, the specialized 
banks frequently do not apply low profit, high risk policy 
credit on time or in the full amount to the intended purpose, or 
they divert it to other uses, thereby hampering smooth 
implementation of national industrial policy). Loans for policy 
purposes are usually issued by the government for designated 
purposes. Actually, however, they become a large common pot of 
funds whose good or bad use, or large or small loss for which no 
one is responsible. Consequently, the specialized banks usually 
do not make sure to control policy loans closely, and units 
using the funds also lack the sense of responsibility they 
should have then they use the funds. Thus, returns from the use 
of policy loans are extremely low. 
  2) The specialized banks do not compete with each other; 
they 
lack vigor and vitality. The professional division of labor 
among the four specialized banks has become a professional 
advantage for each. Professional monopoly enables each of the 
specialized banks to gain commensurate monopoly profits without 
having to make any special effort or provide special services. 
This greatly weakens the operating zeal and the creativity of 
the specialized banks. In addition, the professional monopoly 
also leads to the sequestering of funds, and the splitting up of 
financial markets, which both stifles the vitality and 
efficiency of the financial system and lowers the effectiveness 
of central bank macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  3) Not only do the specialized banks exercise monopoly in 
the 
division of labor realm, but in the entire finance and banking 
system too, the state-owned specialized banks exercise a high 
degree of monopoly. Currently the four state-owned specialized 
banks account for 90 percent of the personnel employed in 
finance and banking nationwide, for 98 percent of the network 
outlet points, and for 84 percent of financial assets. They 
monopolize 75 percent of the savings and loan business in 
society. Other banks and nonbanking financial institutions 
simply cannot compete with the four state-owned specialized 
banks; consequently, efficiency and quality of service in 
China's finance and banking business has declined. 
  Solution to the above problem requires reform of the present 
system of financial organization to improve it gradually. This 
includes earliest possibly founding of policy banks; changing 
the specialized bank's operating mechanism to make them into 
true commercial banks, and steadily developing nonbanking and 
other than state-owned financial institutions. 
  First is earliest possible founding of policy banks. The 
founding of policy banks is the key to separating policy 
financing from commercial financial to solve the problem of 
national specialized banks combining two kinds of business in a 
single institution. It would break the direct link between 
credit provided for policy reasons and basic money, ensure the 
People's Bank's initiative in regulating and controlling basic 
money, and would play a not to be underestimated role in 
straightening out the relationship between public finance and 
the People's Bank, and in truly transforming the operating 
mechanism of the specialized banks. It would enable them to 
become true commercial banks and both a finance and banking 
system and finance and banking organization suited to the needs 
of a socialist market economy. This is a major part of the 
intensification of finance and banking system reform. 
  Policy banks are financial institutions specifically 
responsible for handling policy loans. Thus, all policy loans 
should be within their professional purview. The main kinds of 
policy loans for which state-owned banks are responsible at the 
present time are the following: 1) state investment loans for 
investment in the development of basic industries and basic 
facilities; 2) loans for the stabilization of agricultural 
production that the state directs banks to issue for grain, 
cotton, and edible oil reserves, for contract procurement of 
agricultural and sideline products, and for the development of 
agriculture; 3) buyer and seller loans provided for China's 
import and export of large complete plants; 4) some important 
special loans that the state directs banks to make to support 
and promote the economic opening up and development of certain 
regions. These include loans for the development of science and 
technology, loans for the aged, the young, people living in 
border areas, and people living in impoverished areas, and 
discounted interest loans to help the needy. Such business 
should be conducted by the policy banks whose founding is 
contemplated (The State Long-Term Development Credit Bank, the 
Bank of Agriculture, and the Import-Export Credit Bank). 
  The crux of good operation of policy banks lies in better 
management and supervision of policy loans, all possible being 
done to improve returns from the use of policy loans. First, the 
area of responsibility for policy loans must be defined. Both 
the banks and the users of the loans must bear the risk and the 
responsibility for the loans, user unit garnishing, diversion, 
or defaults on policy loans, and loan losses resulting from bank 
mistakes being punished so as to ensure that policy loans are 
issued and used for the purposes, in the amount, and at the 
interest rate that the state designates, as well as to ensure 
complete repayment at the designated time. This will avoid the 
present situation in which responsibility for policy loans is 
not fixed, and both risks and losses are borne entirely by the 
state. At the same time, the policy loan supervision and control 
system and the supervisory mechanism must be perfected. Policy 
banks must regularly report to the appropriate People's Bank and 
Ministry of Finance units the issuance of loans and their 
intended uses. The People's Bank and units concerned must also 
audit, supervise, and check on policy loan bank's business 
policies, and how well the value of state-owned funds is being 
protected and increased. In short, policy banks would not 
compete with commercial banking institutions, but they would 
still have to improve administration and management so as to 
ensure preservation and increase in value of state-owned assets. 
  The founding of policy banks is an extremely complex and 
daunting task requiring careful planning, painstaking 
organization, and prudent implementation. 
  Second is the transformation of the specialized banks into 
true commercial banks. One important goal in founding policy 
banks is the shedding of specialized banks' policy financing 
functions, allowing them to concentrate on commercial financing 
to operate in accordance with the modern commercial bank 
operating mechanism. 
  Modern commercial banks are a form of a bank related to a 
developed market economy. Although commercial banks have 
developed differently in every country of the world, commercial 
banks share some common characteristics around the world: 1) 
they employ a modern juridical person corporation as their basic 
form of enterprise organization, and their basic operating goal 
is maximization of the rights and interests of shareholders, 
that is, greatest profit and least risk; 2) commercial bank 
business consists mostly of industrial and commercial savings 
accounts and short-term loans; however, they are increasingly 
becoming full service banks; thus, they are termed "financial 
department stores"; 3) commercial banks provide exchange and 
payment services mostly through the handling of check 
withdrawals from current deposits. Thus they have the ability 
and the mechanism for creating currency and expanding credit. 
  The transformation from specialized banks to state-owned 
commercial banks must be based on China's national circumstances 
while taking into account the successful experiences of foreign 
commercial banks. This means doing the following: 
  1) Appropriate splitting up of the specialized national 
banks. Some banks are too large. Even after becoming commercial 
banks, they would still be able to maintain a monopoly. 
Consideration should be given to the appropriate splitting up of 
some specialized banks in order to overcome the business 
monopoly of secondary level banks. They might be divided into 
several independent accounting regional commercial banks 
responsible for their own profits and losses. Once the 
specialized banks have been reorganized as commercial banks, the 
specialized division of labor among them should be dismantled. 
The overlapping of business should be permitted to encourage 
fair and normal competition. 
  2) Clarification of equity relationships. The shortcomings 
of 
China's specialized banks today are largely attributable to 
uncertain equity relationships. Equity relationships might be 
clarified in any of several ways, but on the basis of the way 
both domestic ad foreign banks operate, the stock system might 
be a rather ideal choice. Institution of the stock system in 
commercial banks would help the separation of government 
administration and enterprise management, and it would help 
increase equity limitations, thereby making banks financial 
enterprises having authority to make their own decisions, that 
seek to attain balance, that bear their own risks, and that are 
responsible for their own profits and losses. 
  3) Strict regulation of commercial banks business. In 
today's 
world, banks are providing more services, more complete 
services, and more international services. However, given the 
management level of China's banks and the state of development 
of China's financial markets, commercial banks might better not 
engage in the insurance, trust, and negotiable securities 
businesses in order to shield them from the risks of doing 
business in negotiable securities and trusts and for the sake of 
the stable development of securities markets and the national 
economy. 
  4) Simultaneous with commercial banks own control over the 
ratio between assets and liabilities, the central bank should 
also increase supervision and control over commercial banks, 
both to prevent financial disarray stemming from inept bank 
management and also to prevent an overly rapid expansion of 
commercial bank credit and an ensuing intensification of 
inflation. 
  In addition to the state-owned commercial banks, China's 
commercial banking system also includes the Bank of 
Communications, and the China Trust Enterprise Bank, the Shekou 
Zhaoshang Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Fujian Xingye 
Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, the Guangda Bank, the 
Huaxia Bank, the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and the 
contemplated Chinese Rural Cooperative Bank (formed from the 
removal of business functions from the Bank of Agriculture for 
incorporation into rural credit cooperatives), and the City 
Cooperative Bank (a bank to be trial operated using urban credit 
cooperatives as a basis). These commercial banks exist outside 
the state-owned, state-operated system. They operate under a 
stock system or they are a fully funded subsidiary of an 
enterprise bloc. They also exist outside the specialized bank 
framework of an administrative district-established institution. 
Instead, they serve an economic area. In their operation, they 
also avoid the "large common pot" operating style of the 
specialized banks. They practice the internationally common full 
service banking and control over the ratio between assets and 
liabilities; thus, they have become a "new family" possessed of 
substantial vim and vigor in China's finance and banking system. 
In overall terms, however, these institutions have little power. 
Therefore, when improving them, we should encourage the 
operating of more regional commercial banks, and gradual opening 
of the development of nonstate owned financial institutions. 
  In addition, we must boldly and actively bring foreign banks 
into China on the principle of reciprocity and mutual benefit; 
however, the scale and the pace of their introduction must be 
consistent with China's financial management level and the legal 
climate. At the same time, greater control must be exercised 
over the operations of foreign-owned banks. 
  Third is steady development of nonbanking financial 
institutions. The creation of a finance and banking organization 
system that meets the needs of a market economy, and that is 
fully competitive and imbued with vitality requires not only the 
founding of policy banks and the conversion of national 
specialized banks into commercial banks, but also the 
development of nonbanking financial institutions to bring about 
a situation in which various kinds of financial institutions 
exist together. 
  There are two main reasons for the development of nonbanking 
financial institutions: one is to meet the multifaceted savings 
and investment needs of different economic entities. The second 
is to serve as a competitor with the commercial banks. This will 
help increase pressures on the commercial banks, and stir the 
initiative, zeal, and creativity of the commercial banks, 
thereby increasing the operating efficiency of the financial 
system as a whole. 
  During the past more than a decade of reform, we have 
actively examined and tried out the development of nonbanking 
financial institutions, and we have reconstituted or developed a 
large number of nonbanking financial institutions such as 
insurance companies, trust and investment companies, negotiable 
securities companies, financing and leasing companies, and 
enterprise bloc financial companies. Nevertheless, some problems 
that cannot be ignored remain. One is that such institutions are 
very limited in number and scale by comparison with banks. 
Second, the kinds of such institutions is incomplete. Third, 
affected by the traditional economic model, quite a few 
nonbanking financial institutions retain remnants of and prolong 
the use of the operating methods of the large national banks. 
They lack flexibility and autonomy. 
  The development of nonbanking financial institutions faces 
three tasks: One is improvement. The transformation of 
nonbanking financial institutions must be speeded up to meet the 
needs of a socialist market economy. The intensification of 
reform should serve to change their operating approach, their 
style of operation, and their management system to enable them 
gradually to make their own operating decisions, be responsible 
for their own profits and losses, shoulder risks themselves, and 
develop themselves. At the same time, governments and financial 
control departments at all levels must simplify administration 
and delegate authority. They must give nonbanking financial 
institutions the operating autonomy they need, thereby creating 
conditions for them to go all out in controlling the ratio 
between assets and liabilities, or controlling asset risks. 
Second is development. This means using the existing foundation 
to innovate, and to develop standardized and diversified 
nonbanking financial institutions, and the borrowing of foreign 
experiences to increase the kinds and numbers of China's 
non-banking financial institutions. Third is better supervision 
and control. The central bank must increase supervision and 
control over nonbanking financial institutions regarding their 
capital, their scale of business, and their methods of operation 
to prevent their disturbing and damaging the financial operating 
order. 
<H3>  IV. Standardization of Financial Market Operation, Building 
Financial Markets That Are Uniformly Open, Compete in an Orderly 
Fashion, and Are Strictly Controlled </H3>
  Financial markets are markets for the borrowing and lending 
of money, and for the buying and selling of all kinds of 
negotiable instruments and negotiable securities. On the basis 
of the time limits set by financial instruments, financial 
markets may be divided into money markets (also termed 
short-term funds markets), and capital markets (also termed 
long-term financial markets). Money markets are financial 
markets that deal in money funds financing for up to one year. 
They include bank short-term savings and loan markets, 
commercial paper acceptance and discounting markets, short-term 
national bond markets, and same trade short-term lending 
markets. The latter two are jointly termed negotiable securities 
markets. 
  The founding of financial markets that are uniformly open, 
that compete in an orderly fashion, and that are strictly 
controlled holds important significance for the development of a 
socialist market economy. As an important integral part of the 
market system, the basic function of financial markets is the 
flexible transfer of funds from surplus to shortage areas, and 
from low yield to high yield areas. This requires the use of 
various channels and various methods to mobilize and gather 
together funds to maximize the amount of funds available. At the 
same time, it requires use of the market optimization mechanism 
to permit the optimum allocation of funds. Therefore, financial 
markets are not only an effective way in which to improve the 
utilization of funds and thus increase society's economic 
returns, but are also necessary for optimum allocation of social 
resources and rational readjustment of the industrial structure. 
  Thanks to more than a decade of reform, China's financial 
markets have seen some development. This is manifested primarily 
in the following: 1) Varying degrees of development of money 
markets (including same trade short-term lending markets and 
negotiable instrument discounting markets), and capital markets 
(including stock markets and negotiable securities markets); 2) 
market media institutions (such as negotiable securities 
companies, negotiable securities exchanges, the negotiable 
securities quotation system, negotiable securities registration 
companies, and negotiable securities rating companies), which 
have gradually become more diversified; 3) market entities have 
become more numerous: government, enterprises, individuals, 
banks, and non-banking financial institutions all entering the 
market to become both market fund suppliers and users; and 4) 
market control has gradually become more regulated by the law 
and regulations. 
  At the same time, however, we must also realize that the 
overall level of both money markets and capital markets is still 
relatively low. Both still have fairly serious and glaring 
problems. An example is the inter-bank trade short-term lending 
markets, which have not yet formed a national inter-bank 
discounting market status center to provide responsive feedback 
that transcends the banking system. As a result, national funds 
discounting channels have narrowed, in addition to which 
information does not flow smoothly making discounting costs 
higher. They exceed the time limits, uses, and interest rate 
ceilings that the People's Bank sets for inter-bank discount 
funds, as well as the discounted funds that exceed discounted 
fund inputs as a percentage of all savings or capital. Funds 
converted to credit funds in the name of discounting are issued 
as loans in the form of credit, or discounted funds are used to 
make up for the shortage of working capital in enterprises or to 
make up for the shortage of investment in fixed assets. The long 
lack of distinction between long-term funds and short-term funds 
has resulted in the flow of large amounts of funds from money 
markets into capital markets and real estate markets. The 
long-term use of short-term funds is extremely common 
everywhere, and it upsets the order of financial markets. 
Another example is the stock market where shares have been 
issued or indiscriminately issued without the approval of 
government departments concerned. Stock market self-discipline 
is poor, falsification and deception occurs, insider trading 
takes place, stock market speculation is rampant, the juridical 
entity stock market is separate from the individual stock 
market, and the A shares market and the B shares market are 
separate. Other examples may be found in the price formation and 
the financial instruments interest rate mechanism in financial 
markets. Problems in financial markets also stem from 
administrative distortions, which hamper rational flow of all 
kinds of financial instruments, and macroeconomic regulation and 
control. 
  With the establishment and development of China's socialist 
market economy, a nationwide uniform, open, competitive, and 
orderly financial market becomes a priority task. First, we must 
use the formation of inter-bank discounting markets in every 
jurisdiction as a foundation for earliest possible establishment 
of a nationwide inter-bank discounting market system. Nationwide 
inter-bank funds discounting supervision and control must also 
be intensified so that inter-bank funds discounting is done 
according to law, in a standard way, and scientifically to 
eliminate disorder in funds discounting. In perfecting money 
markets, the main entities in the market and their behavior must 
be clearly defined and standardized, and the direct link between 
money markets and capital markets must be severed to prevent the 
use of short-term funds for long-term purposes. This will enable 
money markets to become monetary policy instruments that the 
central bank can use, and main markets for the regulation and 
control of basic currency and the money supply. Improvement of 
negotiable securities markets includes improvement of national 
bond markets, and regularization of securities markets, 
particularly enhancement of the stock markets. Transformation of 
the enterprise share system must serve as a basis for 
regularizing the issuance and circulation of stock shares to set 
the stage for a common juridical person and individual stock 
market, and A share and B share markets. The regional funds 
boycotting and the departmental separatism stemming from 
regional or departmental protectionism must be changed at once 
to allow the free flow of funds and negotiable securities to 
give full expression to the overall performance of financial 
markets. In particularly, more must be done to build a legal 
system to enhance financial market control. The state must 
respond to the needs inherent in financial market operation by 
issuing standard guidelines in the form of laws and regulations 
about conditions for entry into financial markets, and behavior 
of the main market entities. It must control, guide, coordinate, 
and supervise financial trading activities, using its influence 
on financial market credit costs, credit distribution, and 
credit structure to balance financial market supply and demand, 
to reduce market fluctuations, to stabilize the financial order, 
and to avoid adverse effects on the overall economy resulting 
from the chaotic behavior of financial markets. 
  As was said above, the second obstacle to current 
development 
of financial markets is the price of capital. Serious problems 
continue in the setting of interest rates by administrative fiat 
and on the basis of structural distortions. Specifically, the 
two-track interest rates (meaning the low interest rates of the 
central bank and all specialized banks, and the high interest 
rates of money and capital markets) have become the root of 
numerous problems in China's financial and economic life today 
(such as funds shortages, but large amounts of funds circulating 
outside the system; loss of macrofinancial control; disarray in 
the financial order, or even incipient corruption). Overheating 
of the stock market, the wild rise in real estate prices, and 
the fall in the renminbi exchange rate are all attributable to 
the two-track interest rates. In short, the activation of 
interest rate measures and reform of the way in which the market 
sets interest rates are sluggish. Two seemingly contradictory 
considerations or apprehensions exist. One is the supposition 
that enterprise can continue to obtain funds from the large 
national common pot, and thus there is little sensitivity to 
whether interest rates are high or low. The second is the 
supposition that enterprises will be unable to stand a rise in 
interest rates. However, first of all, even though the 
state-owned economy remains insensitive to interest rate 
changes, in the final analysis, we have a rather large and 
rapidly growing nonstate-owned economy that is fairly sensitive 
to interest rates. In particular, city and countryside 
individual savings accounts are extremely sensitive to interest 
rates. This has been attested to by the rise in fall in savings 
during the past several years. Second, China has a funds 
shortage. At the officially set price for funds, bank interest 
rates are relatively low, and even were they raised slightly, 
they would still be quite low. If enterprises cannot stand even 
such interest rates, that means that low interest rates are 
maintaining low efficiency, and at the cost of doing harm to the 
interests of savings account holders. This low-interest policy 
that violates efficiency principles and fairness principles 
cannot continue. Changing the banks officially set too low 
interest rates and distortions in the interest rate system will 
require merging the present two-track interest rates to a single 
track on which the market sets the interest rate to straighten 
out interest rate relationships. All interest rates must reflect 
time, cost, and risk differences. Rational differences in 
interest must be maintained, and an interest rate system must be 
formed based on basic interest rate of the central bank that is 
adjusted from time to time to reflect the market interest rate, 
and that fully reflects the character and needs of a market 
economy.

"Establish Strong Central Bank Regulatory System" -- Commentary 
Series No. 1 on Deepening Financial Reform] 
  [Text] It was pointed out at the meeting of branch managers 
of the People's Bank of China throughout the country held in 
Beijing from 5 - 7 December that the most important task in 
deepening the financial reform is to change the functions of the 
people's bank and turn it into a genuine central bank. The 
central bank plays a dominant role in the new financial system. 
Therefore, to gradually establish a strong central bank 
regulatory system and increase the capability of the central 
bank in exercising macroeconomic control is of primary 
importance in reforming the financial system. 
  Reform of China's financial system began in the late 1970's. 
After 14 years of efforts from 1978 to 1992, a financial system 
with the central bank as the leading body and state-owned 
specialized banks as the dominant parts and with various 
diversified sectors co-existing and coordinating with each other 
has been basically formed. The financial system has developed 
considerably in terms of variety and quantity. Prior to 1978, 
there was only one People's Bank of China and several rural 
credit cooperatives in the country. As of now, in addition to 
the People's Bank of China, there are four specialized banks, 
namely the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Bank of 
China, the People's Construction Bank of China and the 
Agricultural Bank of China; and 10 nation-wide and regional 
commercial banks, namely the Bank of Communications, the 
Zhongxin Industrial Bank, the Everbright Bank of China, the 
Zhaoshang Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Guangdong 
Development Bank, the Fujian Development Bank, the Huaxia Bank, 
the Pudong Development Bank of Shanghai and the Zhejiang 
Commercial Bank. There are also over 80 securities companies and 
a large number of financial companies and modernized financing 
and leaseholding companies. In addition, there are many urban 
and rural credit cooperatives in various cities and towns. Since 
the approval of the first foreign-funded bank in Shenzhen, 
foreign financial institutions have set up more than 90 branches 
in China. As of now, China has basically changed the "large and 
consolidated" banking system to one of many financial 
institutions working side by side. This kind of reform and 
exploration are aimed at keeping abreast of the economic 
development in the past with emphasis on planned economy. 
  The party's 14th National Congress explicitly put forward 
the 
need to establish a new system of socialist market economy. 
Apparently the financial system with emphasis on planned economy 
in the past is unable to keep pace with the new changes. Efforts 
must be made to change this economic system in accordance with 
the requirements of the socialist market economy. It is similar 
to the fact that people need to change their own clothes to keep 
pace with the climatic changes in spring, summer, autumn and 
winter. The first thing to be affected is the change of the 
functions of the people's bank so as to establish a strong 
central bank regulatory system. 
  The central bank plays a leading role in the new financial 
system. Its major functions should be: lead and control all 
financial institutions in the country, scientifically formulate 
and implement financial and monetary policy, control the supply 
of currency and ensure the basic stability of currency value; 
and supervise and control financial institutions, ensure safe 
and effective operations in the financial system. 
  Under the conditions of the socialist market economy, the 
People's Bank of China has always regarded the task of 
increasing efficiency in exercising macroeconomic control as its 
major goal. However, the dual target of achieving both economic 
growth and currency stability and that of accomplishing both 
overall control and structural readjustment constitutes the 
major reason for the weak macroeconomic control of the central 
bank. 
  For a long period, China has always adopted monetary 
policies by ensuring both economic development and price 
stability. However, in practice, the governments in various 
localities, on the one hand, often attach more importance in 
economic development and sedulously work hard to seek high rates 
of economic growth. They often use investments with poor 
economic results to achieve their goal for economic growth, 
resulting in the excessive issuance of currency and causing 
inflation. On the other hand, due to lack of an efficient and 
flexible mechanism to regulate currency and credit, a tendency 
to restrain economic growth which causes economic decline often 
prevails in order to stabilize the currency value. This not only 
prevents the national economy from developing healthily, but 
also loses public support and causes economic instability. Since 
the implementation of the reform and opening up policy, the 
readjustment in 1981, the tightening of the money supply in 
1985, the improvement and rectification campaign in 1989 and the 
strengthening of macroeconomic control in 1993 all fall into 
this category. Naturally the macroeconomic control this year is 
different than those in the past. It is not an overall 
retrenchment, but a kind of structural readjustment. Therefore, 
the central bank should undoubtedly regard the task of 
stabilizing the currency value as its major target, and promote 
economic growth while ensuring the stability of the currency. 
  In a socialist market economy, it is an usual or even common 
phenomenon that the total social demand exceeds the social 
supply. Often the growth of the total social demand is quite 
strong. In view of this situation, the people's bank must change 
from attaching importance to both overall control and structural 
readjustment to placing emphasis on overall control in order to 
do a still better job in maintaining currency stability. That is 
to control the total amount of currency supplied by the whole 
banking system. Currency is created by banks in the form of 
loans. To place the total amount of loans under control is the 
key in controlling the supply of currency. The people's bank 
must issue or withdraw the basic currency according to the rise 
or fall of commodity prices, the rate of growth of the supply of 
currency and the amount of excess deposits. 
  With the deepening of reform of the financial system, the 
people's bank should work hard to change from its direct control 
of the amount of loans to the use of economic, legal and 
administrative means by carrying out open market operations, 
keeping adequate reserve funds for deposits, determining the 
proper interest rates, loan ceilings and exchange rates. On the 
basis of the conditions in market development, it should 
gradually attach more importance to indirect control and 
eventually regard indirect control as its principal measure. 
  The people's bank must strengthen the control of the basic 
currency, reduce the amount of uncovered advance and gradually 
give priority to selling and buying state bonds, financial 
bonds, using them as securities for loans and handling note 
discount businesses. 
  Another major function of the central bank is to supervise 
and control the financial institutions, and ensure that the 
financial system is safe and sound in operation. All branches of 
the people's bank must pay full attention to supervising and 
controlling the financial system and conducting investigation 
and study. With the gradual establishment of the socialist 
market economy, the deepening of the reform of the financial 
system and the development of banking businesses, the number of 
regional financial institutions with the status of a legal 
person is increasing, and there are more and more banking 
business activities. As there is more competition among 
financial institutions in various districts and regions, 
contradictions among the financial institutions, between the 
financial institutions and the enterprises and among individuals 
have continued to emerge. On the other hand, the basic task of 
the commercial banks is to do financing, while their major 
target is to make maximum profit. However, there is a 
contradiction between profit-making and the need to ensure 
repayment. The risk of investments and loans with larger profits 
is often poor, while safe investments are always less 
profitable. Financial institutions must achieve balance and make 
the best choice among factors of safety, liquidity and 
profitability. Thus, the central bank and its branches must use 
various methods to exercise strict supervision and control over 
the business activities of various monetary institutions. 
Meanwhile, they must also keep their eyes on various 
unauthorized, illegal fund-raising and financing activities in 
all localities. 
  First of all, a direct and effective measure is to 
strengthen 
the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities and 
the management of risks. The basic principle in strengthening 
the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities is 
as follows: 
  1) It is necessary to restrain the use of funds by means of 
the sources of assets. 
  2) It is essential to establish structural correspondence. 
That is, the utilization of long-term capital must correspond 
with the stable sources of such capital. 
  3) It is imperative to make the best use of funds. 
  4) It is necessary to divert risks. It should be stipulated 
that loans to any client should not exceed a certain percentage 
of the client's capital. Efforts must be made to avoid extending 
exorbitant loans to one enterprise only. The principal measure 
in strengthening management of risks for assets is to divide the 
bank's assets into different categories, estimate risks of such 
assets and adopt different forms of management for the assets of 
different risks. Working out a regulation on the rate of 
abundance of capital and determining the risks of assets are 
something fundamental in doing management of risks for assets. 
If it is said that the asset liability ratio management 
emphasizes quantitative control, the assets risk management is 
mainly aimed at exercising an overall qualitative control over 
the bank's assets and liabilities. The management of risks for 
assets is a complex system engineering project. Its entire 
process involves the forecast, prevention and diversion of risks. 
  Next, to make the reform of the financial system a success, 
it is necessary to improve legislation on banking. While 
implementing a reform measure, it is essential to formulate a 
complete set of relevant laws, regulations, systems and methods. 
Right now, the state is working on the "Law of People's Bank of 
China," the "Banking Law of the People's Republic of China," 
"Insurance Law," and the "Law of Bills" and some relevant rules, 
regulations and measures. They are aimed at helping financial 
institutions carry out and manage their businesses, supervising 
and controlling them according to law, maintaining financial 
order and stability and ensuring the safety of the financial 
system. For example, in light of the interest rate war among 
some financial institutions in the province during the first 
quarter of this year, the branch of the People's Bank of China 
in Henan Province had enacted a 50-article regulation to 
strengthen the control of interest rates, stopped the war on 
interest rates and curbed the competition among various 
financial institutions in the province. 
  During the period of transition from planned economy to 
socialist market economy, the situation is usually complicated 
in the realm of financial affairs. It often involves important 
issues of policy. Each reform measure must be formulated and 
implemented in close touch with reality. All kinds of 
contradictions and problems in economic and monetary affairs 
must be studied and analyzed timely, accurately and completely; 
and measures taken to resolve them. China is a vast country. 
Situations differ in thousands of ways in the eastern and 
western regions, special economic zones, the coastal and the 
inland areas, economically developed districts, and old 
liberated, minority, border and poverty-stricken regions. The 
task of the people's bank and its various branches in conducting 
investigation and study remains arduous. Only by doing a good 
job in conducting investigation and study, will it be possible 
for us to build a solid foundation for scientifically 
formulating and implementing the currency and credit policies 
and strengthening macroeconomic control. Meantime, we will be 
able to help the various localities to develop their economy, 
and assist enterprises and relevant departments to strengthen 
their management, become market-oriented and improve their 
economic efficiency. 
  With the deepening of the financial structural reform, banks 
are playing an increasingly important role in the national 
economy and gradually becoming important sectors of the state in 
exercising macroeconomic control. As a leading department in the 
new financial system, the People's Bank of China must closely 
follow the guideline laid down in the "Decision" adopted by the 
3d Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress, further 
change its functions, and genuinely shoulder the glorious duties 
and missions assigned it by the Party Central Committee and the 
State Council.

<F P=106> [Article by JINRONG SHIBAO reporter Han Suqin: "Separation </F>
of Policy-Lending Banking from Commercial Banking Necessary in 
Carrying Out Structural Reform" -- Commentary Series No 2 on 
Deepening Financial Reform] 
  [Text] For a long period of time, state-owned banks play a 
dominant role in China's financial system. With the functions of 
government and enterprises not separated, the state-owned banks 
play the dual role of both policy-lending and commercial 
banking. They monopolize the banking business to a certain 
extent, creating a situation characterized by lack of 
competition and low efficiency. This has distorted the role of 
the specialized banks prevented the banks from operating in the 
manner of enterprises and curbed the influence of the banking 
industry in the realm of economy. All this does not conform with 
the principle of seeking maximum beneficial returns in market 
economy. Nor is it conducive to building the foundation for 
strengthening the macro-economic control. 
  China is a developing nation which will have a shortage of 
funds for a long time to come. Meanwhile, the nation has a 
bound duty to insure that enough funds are available in 
promoting economic development in backward areas, in developing 
infrastructural facilities and major construction projects, in 
increasing agricultural production and in readjusting the 
industrial structure. Policy-oriented banking is a form of 
financing that the state uses in performing the aforementioned 
functions. 
  Policy-oriented banking is aimed at resolving issues for 
better social efficiency. However, there are some economic 
sectors with lower social efficiency that cannot afford to make 
the regular interest payments for their loans. For example, one 
of major investments of policy-lending banks is agriculture, 
including funds for the storage and purchase of farm and 
sideline products and for agricultural development. China is a 
major farming country. Either right now or in the future, 
agriculture remains China's foundation for economic development 
and social stability. This situation will not change, despite 
the development of the market economy. Meanwhile, agriculture is 
also a sector that requires a large amount of investment, while 
its financial returns are low and its cycle of investment 
turnover long. Therefore the use of policy-oriented banking in 
support of agricultural development is a long-term task. In this 
sense, this form of banking is similar to the state policy, 
which help the state exercise its macroeconomic control. This 
is the basic difference between policy-lending banking and 
commercial banking. 
  Policy-lending is different from other financial function. 
The sources of the funds are not from taxes. Nor are the funds 
unpaid appropriation. Policy-lending is a banking business. 
Policy-lending financial institutions must raise their funds in 
the form of debts such as issuing bonds. Therefore, the banks 
often use the funds to make money in the form of loans. 
Naturally, loans must be repaid. Policy-lending financial 
institutions must follow the macroeconomic policy of the state 
concerning the amount of loans, outlets for investments and time 
frame for the loans; take into consideration the peculiar 
characteristics of the fund-using units; and give them 
preferential treatments in terms of interest rate. However, 
loans are debts after all. It is necessary to guarantee the 
return of capital plus a small amount of profit. This is 
precisely the basic difference between policy-lending and 
financial appropriations. 
  China's specialized banks are doing policy-lending 
businesses 
over a protracted period. They do policy-lending as well as 
commercial businesses. Therefore, there are many drawbacks such 
as problems in agricultural development, IOU problems in the 
purchase of farm products, problems in investments for major 
state construction projects, problems of technical 
transformation for large- and medium-sized enterprises, and 
problems of credit and loans for the import and export of 
large-sized production equipment. All such problems cannot be 
easily solved. However, some of the regular commercial 
businesses have been neglected due to this kind of chaotic 
situation in management. This has also prevented China's 
specialized banks from starting to reform themselves. Several 
years ago, some theoreticians and the central bank had the idea 
of reforming specialized banks by separating policy-lending 
banking from commercial banking in terms of accounting, but 
there were great deal of difficulties when such reform measure 
was put into practice. The "Decision of the CPC Central 
Committee on Some Issues Concerning Establishment of a Socialist 
Market Economic Structure" pointed out: "We should establish 
policy-lending banks, and should separate policy-lending banking 
from commercial banking. We should organize the National 
Development Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China, all of them 
handling strictly defined policy-related business." A department 
concerned reveals that in the next round of financial reform, 
the state will establish three policy-lending banks to 
specialize in handling policy-related financing. 
  To separate policy-lending banking from commercial banking 
will be conducive to reforming the investment system. The new 
National Development Bank will be a policy-lending bank aimed at 
financing the major construction projects of the state. It will 
manage the funds it has raised in a centralized manner to ensure 
the completion of the major construction projects in the state 
plan. It will evaluate the projects and determine the lending 
priorities; keep spending within the limits of its own 
resources; and supervise and control the utilization of its 
funds. By doing so, it will be able to not only meet the 
requirements in the development of all major construction 
projects and make the best use of the loans for the development 
of capital construction projects, but also change the situation 
whereby sources of construction funds are unreliable; no one 
assumes the responsibility for investment risks; or the total 
amount of investments is entirely out of control. 
  By establishing policy-lending banks, we will be able to 
provide financing in support and in favor of agriculture. One of 
the functions of the Agricultural Bank of China, which will be 
in charge of policy-lending business after its reform, is to 
issue policy-related loans for the storage of grain crops, 
cotton and edible oil for the state and for the purchase of farm 
and sideline products on a contractual basis. This means that 
all the policy-related businesses in support of agriculture 
which are now being handled by several specialized banks will be 
managed by a single policy-lending bank. This will be conducive 
to efficiently using the credit and funds for agriculture, and 
helping retrieve agricultural loans and implement the state 
policy of supporting agriculture. 
  The major task of the new Import and Export Credit Bank is 
to 
provide credit and funds for the buyers and sellers in importing 
or exporting complete sets of large-sized equipment and provide 
credit discount and guarantee for the Bank of China in exporting 
complete sets of machinery and electronic products. 
  The separation of the policy-lending business from the 
commercial business is conducive to turning state specialized 
banks into modern commercial banks. For many years, the 
state-owned specialized banks have been unable to act according 
to the business principle in tapping fund resources, in making 
full use of their funds, in determining interest rates and doing 
accounting work, since they handle both policy-lending and 
commercial financing businesses. They cannot operate like a 
modern commercial bank. Meanwhile, various banks handle 
different volume of policy-related business. It will be 
difficult to objectively evaluate each bank's performance in 
extending loans and create conditions for all banks to compete 
with one other on an equal basis. After the complete separation 
of policy-lending financing from commercial financing, no one is 
able to "eat from the same big pot" of policy-lending business. 
Nor can anyone use policy-lending business as an excuse to cover 
up poor performances in management. Naturally, policy-lending 
banks should assume their own risks, manage their businesses 
with their capital safeguarded, and refrain from competing with 
commercial banks. 
  The current situation shows that the separation of 
policy-lending banking from commercial banking will be faced 
with a great deal of difficulties in forming the correct 
ideology, bringing about structural changes, hiring personnel, 
clearing up accounts, handing business accounting, and 
transferring financial claims and liabilities. There will be a 
period of transition in actual operation. However, we have to 
march toward this direction sooner or later. Without this 
separation, it will be hard to establish a new financial system. 
We believe that following the separation of China's 
policy-lending banking from commercial banking and the progress 
in other aspects in the financial system reform, there will a 
new leap forward in China's banking business.

Specialized Banks as Genuine Commercial Banks" -- Commentary 
Series No 3 on Deepening Financial Reform] 
  [Text] With the vigorous development of the socialist 
market economy, banking plays an even more important role in the 
national economy, and the reform of the financial system has 
already become a pressing task. Another important task in 
deepening the reform of China's financial system reform is to 
separate policy-lending banking from commercial banking and turn 
state-owned specialized banks into genuine commercial banks. 
This is an important part of comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction 
that "efforts must be made to manage banks as genuine banks" and 
the key to deepening the financial system reform. 
  The financial organizational system preliminarily set up 
during the 14 year period of reform and opening up doubtlessly 
represents a remarkable progress as compared with the banks in 
the past which only hired "tellers" and "accountants." This 
system is under the leadership of the People's Bank of China and 
mainly composed of state-owned specialized banks with various 
other economic sectors working side by side and coordinating 
with one another through a division of work. However, for many 
years, China's state-owned specialized banks have, on the one 
hand, performed the functions as commercial banks, while on the 
other hand, they have not developed the mechanism of modern 
commercial banks in managing theirs own affairs, assuming their 
own risks, restraining themselves and assuming the 
responsibility for their own profits and losses. This has 
prevented the entire banking system in China from meeting the 
requirements in developing a socialist market economy. The 
functions and scope of operation of the four specialized banks 
which are regarded as the major forces of the financial circle 
have not been clearly defined. Due to the fact that the 
functions of the government are not separated from those of 
enterprises, the bank's business operation has been interfered 
by the local authorities. As a result, the credit operations of 
the national bank are provincialized and funds divided into 
pieces. There is no guarantee for the supply of funds in 
developing the major construction projects of the state. 
Moreover, the profit-oriented specialized banks have plans to 
expand their credits, but they lack the mechanism to avoid 
risks. Thus, there are increasing number of bad debts and 
overdue bills, and their credit rating is notably lowered. Bad 
debts in some specialized banks make up as much as 30 percent of 
their total assets. The shortcomings and problems which have 
cropped up show that it is of great urgency to manage 
state-owned specialized banks as commercial banks and establish 
a good system of modern commercial banks in order to meet the 
requirements in the development of socialist market economy. 
This is because that with the vigorous development of the reform 
and opening up program, tremendous changes have taken up in the 
environment under which the banks operate. The banks' funds have 
gradually become market-oriented, and the banks have been asked 
to use their funds as a commodity in running their businesses. 
Industrial and commercial enterprises have become legal persons 
of self-management. Banks have been asked to run as enterprises 
instead of administrative organs and cooperate with each other 
on an equal basis. After the barriers between different 
departments and regions are removed, credit funds are 
continuously increasing on the market. Banks at home and abroad 
are expanding their cooperation. All this demands that banks in 
China link with international commercial banks in business 
operations and change their system of only supplying credit 
funds to a system of business operation. 
  Efforts must be made to transform the specialized banks into 
genuine state-owned commercial banks, which mainly handle 
deposits from and loans to industrial and commercial enterprises 
and regard profits as their main target in doing business. 
Organizationally they will be national commercial banks, each 
with a head office and many branches. In dealing with outsiders, 
they are independent legal persons under centralized business 
management. After the modern commercial banks start to operate, 
it is necessary to follow the principle of managing their own 
affairs, assuming their own risks, bearing the responsibility 
for their own profits and losses and restraining themselves. It 
is essential to view the commercial banks in the country as a 
whole, centralize their management and unify the procedure of 
fund management. In business operation, modern commercial banks 
must uphold the principle of combining profitability, fluidity 
and safety. Since they mainly use money deposited in the banks 
in extending loans, their risks are higher than ordinary 
industrial and commercial enterprises. Meanwhile, they are not 
obliged to do policy-oriented financing and "subsidize" those 
enterprises which are suffering losses, they can justly pay full 
attention to profits from now on. Modern commercial banks should 
also independently make their own decisions on investments, 
break away from the administrative interferences from the 
governments at all levels, and strive to reap maximum profits 
with minimum risks. Efforts must be made to strengthen 
supervision and control over the risks taken by state-owned 
commercial banks. As the owner of state-owned commercial banks, 
the state must supervise, through the board of supervisors, 
their management and how they preserve and increase the value of 
state assets. Nevertheless, the state should not interfere with 
the banks' routine business activities. 
  The most basic characteristics of state-owned commercial 
banks is their need to manage their own affairs, bear the 
responsibility for their own profits and losses, assume their 
own risks and restrain themselves. They must implement the 
various guidelines and policies of the party and the state. 
Under no circumstances should they regard making investments in 
stocks and shares, and buying securities and real estate at 
lower prices and selling them out at higher prices a part of 
their regular operation. According to international practice, 
various countries have set limits on the scope of business 
operation for the commercial banks. Even many countries with 
fairly developed market economy explicitly forbid commercial 
banks to make investments in industries and illegally buying and 
selling securities. Therefore state-owned commercial banks 
should be forbidden to make direct investments in nonbanking 
enterprises. 
  After the reform of the financial system, China's system of 
commercial banks should include state-owned commercial banks, 
the Bank of Communications and other national and regional 
commercial banks and rural and urban cooperative banks. 
  Specialized banks must go through a process to become 
state-owned commercial banks. It depends on the external 
environment, particularly the gradual establishment of the 
system of modern enterprises. It also depends on the internal 
management mechanism such as the principle of operation and the 
system and methods for internal management. All these must be 
standardized and improved in accordance with the general 
principle governing the commercial banks and the Banking Law. 
Efforts must be made in a down-to-earth manner to study and 
explore how to carry out reform in this respect. 
  After reforming themselves, state-owned commercial banks 
will 
become the mainstay of the new financial organizational system. 
They will be able to do a better job in providing financial 
services of all types, to keep pace with the developing 
socialist market economy and to help promote the national 
economy continuously, swiftly and healthily.

<F P=106> [Article by Yang Shuang: "Establish Good Financial Market </F>
System" -- Commentary Series No 4 on Deepening Financial Reform] 
  [Text] The financial market is an important component part 
of modern market economy. There must be a well-developed 
financial market in a flourishing market economy. The 14th 
National CPC Congress explicitly pointed out that the goal of 
the economic system reform is to establish a socialist market 
economic system. Therefore, to establish a financial market that 
satisfies the needs of the socialist market economy is something 
basic and important in reforming China's financial system. 
  The financial market is divided into the money market 
(short-term financial market), capital market (long-term 
financial market), stock market, foreign exchange market and 
gold market. China resumed the issuance of treasury bonds in 
1984, and Shanghai issued the first batch of stocks in 1984. The 
financial market began to develop since 1986, but it is still in 
the preliminary stage and there are plenty of rooms for further 
development. China's future financial market should be a unified 
and open market with orderly competition and strict management. 
It has the general features of today's world financial market as 
well as China's special characteristics. It is well adapted to 
the current situation in economic and social development in 
China. In this unified and open financial market, funds which 
are regarded as a commodity in business transactions are able to 
circulate freely throughout the country so that limited social 
resources are allocated in various localities. If the financial 
market is cut into pieces, it will be difficult to circulate 
funds and put them to effective use. This will be a tremendous 
loss to China where funds are badly needed. In the past, China's 
financial market is not unified and open due to various reasons, 
and people in the financial circles were often restricted to 
carry out their activities in a designated area. In dealing with 
this situation, we must further carry out reform to develop a 
unified, open market. If it is said that a unified, open 
financial market is the basic prerequisite for the effective 
circulation of funds, building an orderly and competitive market 
is the basic way for the effective circulation of funds. 
Competition instills vitality into the financial market. If 
there is no competition, or competition is not allowed, it will 
be difficult to make the financial market prosperous and avoid 
market monopoly by a few financial institutions. Meanwhile, this 
kind of competition must be orderly and it should be carried out 
in accordance with certain rules and regulations. The "illegal 
day-to-day loans" and certain types of chaotic phenomena noticed 
on the stock market not long ago were precisely signs of 
disorderly competition. This kind of disorderly, malignant, and 
abnormal competition will disturb the market and harm the 
legitimate interests of the people and enterprises in the 
society. It would even endanger the regular operation of social 
economy. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a good legal 
system for China's financial market and exercise strict 
supervision and control over the market. We must adopt resolute 
measures and firmly curb these illegal activities. We must also 
use our policy to guide those who participate in various 
activities on the market to ensure that market competition 
remains unified, open and orderly. 
  There is no doubt that a flourishing financial market plays 
an important role in helping develop a modern economy and the 
enterprises. However, the growth of China's financial market is 
far from being strong in despite of the fact that for the past 
14 years since the beginning of the reform program, such market 
in China has started from scratch and begun to take shape. Due 
to the fact that it was born at the time when the new system was 
replacing the old, it still remains in the preliminary stage, 
and many sectors of the market are still not operating smoothly. 
Therefore, to quicken the pace in building the financial market 
and strengthen market management has become an important theme 
in reforming the financial system. 
  To achieve this goal, it is, first of all, necessary to 
improve the money market. As a short-term financial market, the 
money market plays a significant role in helping the central 
bank exercise its macroeconomic control and the monetary 
institutions utilize the time of turn-around of the funds, in 
financing lateral financial institutions and making the best use 
of available funds. 1) It is necessary to strengthen the control 
of the money market, and set standards for the major 
participants of the market and their behavior. 2) It is 
essential to cut the direct link between the money market and 
the capital market, and stop funds from flowing from the money 
market to the capital market. Otherwise, there will be boundless 
increases of investments in fixed assets, causing economic 
overheating and serious inflation. 3) On the basis of different 
requirements in regulating money supply and adjusting supply and 
demand, it is imperative to set standards for the overnight loan 
market and the short-term financing market. 4) It is necessary 
to gradually develop an open business operation of the central 
bank and turn the money market into a tool of the central bank 
for implementing the monetary policy and into the main arena for 
regulating the basic currency and the money supply. 
  Second, the stock market is the principal form of the 
capital 
market. Many problems have cropped in China's stock market 
during the three years since the opening of the stock exchanges 
in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Thus, we must vigorously develop this 
market and make further improvements. Efforts must be made to 
further improve the market for treasury and financial bonds. 
From the point of view of credit and money, all activities 
concerning credit invariably affect the money supply. Therefore, 
we must make use of the large number of geographically 
widespread financial institutions to help selling government 
bonds. This is not only conducive to the issuance and 
circulation of government bonds. It also helps enhance credit 
worthiness of the government bonds and create conditions for the 
central bank to regulate the money supply. In addition, the 
stock market should also be further standardized. We must do a 
good job in transforming the enterprise share-holding system, 
set up a standard procedure for issuing and listing stock on the 
market, and strengthen control over stock exchanges and the 
stock exchange system. Currently, the market for corporate 
stocks and that for personal stocks are separated, while the 
market for Type-A stocks and that for Type-B stocks are not in 
line with each other. We must energetically create conditions 
and gradually form a unified and standard stock market. 
  Third, we must further develop and form a standard foreign 
exchange market. Measures have been taken to reform the system 
for the control of China's foreign exchange. After the 
implementation of the method of allowing units to retain a part 
of foreign exchange they have earned for their own use, a number 
of foreign exchange swap markets have taken shape. Nevertheless, 
there is still a part of foreign exchange which goes to units 
that use the foreign exchange through administrative channels 
instead of the swap market. Meanwhile, a dual-track or 
multi-track system is being implemented in determining the 
foreign exchange rate. Therefore, it is necessary to set a 
single foreign exchange rate; develop a mechanism to form a 
unified exchange rate and turn monetary institutions into the 
mainstay for the foreign exchange market; and finally, form a 
completely unified foreign exchange market to run the financial 
market in an orderly manner.

reporter: "Electric Power: Another Bottleneck in China's 
Economy"] 
  [Text] [Editorial Note] Today, we begin a series dealing 
with electric power issues with this article, "Electric Power: 
Another Bottleneck in China's Economy." The subject matter of 
the series will be of two types: reportage uncovering 
contradictions and pointing out means of resolving them; 
descriptions of typical cases in power construction about which 
people have strong feelings. 
  For the people's economy to achieve sustained, rapid, and 
effective development, we must readjust industry's structure and 
conscientiously eliminate the bottlenecks that constrain it. 
This is a major, real issue of broad significance which should 
attract attention at all levels and from all quarters. Points of 
view, statements of concern, and advocacy from all parties will 
help to further clarify the situation, to achieve unity of 
understanding, to draw on collective wisdom, and to find better, 
more numerous and more effective methods and approaches to 
resolve the contradictions. In the future this paper will tackle 
major, multilevel problems of economic activity and economic 
life and will use serialized reports and continuing coverage to 
investigate and analyze them, so as to promote the appropriate 
solution of real problems. We hope those working in the economy 
will highlight themes for us. 
  It should be made clear that, for a variety of reasons, our 
reportage is not necessarily comprehensive; its objective is to 
prompt serious consideration by all quarters, to launch a 
discussion and to seek a consensus. 
  Everyone would agree that railroads are currently a 
bottleneck in the economy. 
  But if we were to state that electric power is another such 
bottleneck that is constraining China's economic development, 
not everyone would agree: many comrades would stare in blank 
surprise, wondering if this was indeed the case. 
  For did not China's national power output and installed 
capacity vault into fourth place in the world in 1987, and have 
they not retained this position since then? And in the five 
years since 1988, has not 60 million kW of new capacity been 
installed, equivalent to the total amount installed in the 30 
years before the reform and opening to the outside? 
  And is it not true that, on average, China's electric power 
output in two days is now equivalent to its power output for the 
entire year of 1949? 
  It is true that these objections are all based on fact; but 
they do not give the whole story regarding China's electric 
power situation. There is another group of equally important 
facts. 
  Like a specter, power shortages have haunted China for more 
than 20 years. Numerous power outages or cutbacks indicate that 
even though electric power is supposed to be a vanguard, it is 
falling increasingly in arrears, and its rate of advance is 
being hobbled. 
  China's supply of electric power began to be tight in 1970, 
when there was occasionally not enough to go around. Because 
power generating equipment must be operated so as to maintain a 
constant balance between production, supply, and sales, the 
principal emergency measure used to "compensate" power shortages 
was to cut off or cut back on the supply of power. As a result, 
power supply planning offices (which later were also given the 
functions of power conservation and power safety, hence gaining 
the name of "three-power" offices) sprang up all over the 
country. Owing to their painstaking management, factories and 
mines, offices and units, and the urban and rural populace began 
to take turns in experiencing load cutbacks or power shutoffs 
one or more times a week. 
  In order to alleviate this intolerable situation, the party 
and government have taken a series of measures during the past 
20 years, and the power industry has in fact made rapid strides. 
But the annual pace of the economy's development has also been 
fairly rapid, and as a result, a debate over whether the power 
industry is lagging behind has intermittently broken out. 
  At the end of the Seventh 5-Year Plan and the beginning of 
the Eighth 5-Year Plan, the dispute as to whether or not there 
was an electric power shortage re-emerged. One view was that 
from 1988 to 1991, the average amount of newly installed 
generating capacity exceeded 10 million kW, and that the 
country's power supply shortage had been alleviated. Proponents 
of this view pointed to the fact that in 1990, the number of 
power cutoffs or cutbacks in Beijing and the amount of power 
involved decreased by 79.1 and 76.77 percent respectively, 
compared with 1989, and in northeast China, power cutbacks and 
outages were essentially eliminated. Another view is that this 
alleviation was only temporary and resulted from a slump in 
production capacity during the period of administrative 
rectification. Neither viewpoint conceded to the other. But 
numerous events since 1992 have put an end to the debate: not 
only has China's electric power shortage not been fundamentally 
alleviated, but adversity has been piled on adversity as local 
power shortages have expanded into a national power shortage and 
intermittent outages have become continuous shortages. 
  Comrades of the National Electric Power Dispatching 
Communications Center gave a reporter the following information: 
  --China's per capita electric power output is now only 644 
kWh, or 40 percent of the world average, leaving China in the 
80th place in the world. 
  --Of the 30 province-level administrative units on the 
mainland, only the Ningxia Muslim Autonomous Region has a slight 
excess of supply over demand; all other provinces, autonomous 
regions, and directly subordinate municipalities are 
experiencing various degrees of difficulty in making ends meet. 
  --Beijing began to experience power shortages in the 1970s, 
and they are now increasing in severity. In 1991, the actual 
supply of electric power fell short of the planned figure by 
400,000 kW; in 1992 the shortfall reached 493,000 kW; and in 
1993 it will increase further, to 683,000 kW. In the first half 
of this year [1993], cutbacks in electric power reached 671,000 
kW, an increase of 30.8 percent over the figure of 513,000 kW in 
the previous year. The shortages were most severe in May, when 
the average daily power cutback rose rapidly to 1.395 million 
kW, an increase of 134 percent from the previous year. 
  --In the East China Grid, which has the greatest installed 
capacity of the country's five major power grids, during the 
first half of this year electric power output was up 9.87 
percent from last year, but supply and demand conflicts were 
extremely acute: from January to May, in Jiangsu and Zhejiang 
provinces alone, there were 12,480 instances of power cutoffs or 
cutbacks mandated by the East China Grid General Scheduling 
Office or the Central Scheduling Offices of the two provinces' 
grid centers; this figure is 4.9 times the figure for the 
preceding year. The cumulative reduction in load was 79.24 
million kW, 2.8 times the figure in the equivalent period of 
last year. 
  --In Guangdong Province, which is on the leading edge of 
China's reform and opening to the outside, the start of electric 
power shortages coincided with the beginning of economic growth. 
For more than a decade, the shortfall of electric power has been 
about 30 percent, and the purchasing of electric power from Hong 
Kong that began in 1979 will continue this year; the amount 
purchased has already increased by a factor of more than 10. 
  --The Northeast China Grid had no power shortages two years 
ago, but this year it will experience a shortfall of 900 million 
kWh, so that users who earlier suffered shutoffs and cutbacks 
will be subjected to the same unpleasantness again. 
  --Numerous incidents, both past and present, make it clear 
that China's electric power industry is falling far too short of 
society's continually expanding need for electricity for 
production and for household use. 
  The electric power shortage is not only holding back the 
continuous, steady, effective growth of the national economy, 
but is also adding to the electric power worries of the masses 
everywhere and infecting the power industry with persistent 
maladies. 
  Some liken electric power to the "life blood" of the 
national 
economy and electric power shortages to anemia: it is clear than 
an anemic patient will have no way of joining the ranks of the 
healthy and vigorous. 
  Developing the national economy is a systems engineering 
activity, and the constraints that are imposed on it by the 
electric power bottleneck are mostly advance constraints. For 
example, China's railroads are not only limited in number, but 
also have low technical standards and limited haulage capacity. 
There is an urgent need to build new electrified lines and to 
electrify existing lines. But if the regions that need new or 
reconstructed lines cannot find the needed electric power, there 
will be no way of making a start with this railway 
electrification. In the 20 years during which China has 
experienced power shortages, there must have been many such 
cases of construction projects that were not built or that were 
built late. 
  The other adverse effects of the electric power bottleneck 
are mostly visible and tangible. 
  First, power cutoffs and cutbacks have caused immense losses 
of industrial output. Everyone knows that without electric power 
to drive it, almost all modern production equipment becomes 
incapable of functioning. But in the priorities for electric 
power cutoffs and cutbacks that the power supply planning 
offices throughout the country have set up, it is industrial 
power users that bear the main impact. In Guangdong, electric 
power shortages result in a loss of power for three or even four 
days a week, and as a result, 30 percent or more of productive 
capacity is idled. It is estimated that at least a third of the 
country's productive capacity stands idle as a result of power 
shortages. Comrades of the Ministry of Electric Power state that 
our annual electric power shortfall is about 15 to 20 percent. 
In 1992, for example, the total electric energy shortfall for 
the year was between 111.7 and 148.9 billion kWh. If we assume 
that each kWh used by industry represents an output value of 4.9 
yuan, then last year the country lost between 547.33 and 729.61 
billion yuan of output. This constitutes an immense economic 
loss. 
  In addition, electric power cutbacks cause harm to 
electrical 
equipment, product quality, and production management. In 
certain industrial and mining enterprises, even if conscientious 
preparations are made after receiving notification of a power 
shutoff, some harm to equipment and products is unavoidable. 
  In addition, serious power shortages also affect China's 
opening to the outside. Experience with the development of 
China's "three capital" enterprises shows that a sufficient 
supply of energy is an important precondition for attracting 
business and capital. Other conditions being equal, foreign 
investigators always "go where the lights are on." The Shenzhen 
Special Economic Zone, the first to be developed in this 
country, has consistently taken emergency measures to assure a 
sufficient, uninterrupted supply of electric power. In addition 
to buying electricity from Hong Kong, at the end of 1991 alone 
it commissioned 10 small fossil-fired power plants (which are 
very uneconomical) with a generating capacity of 500,000 kW, 
investing more than 1.6 billion yuan for the purpose. Even so, 
electricity shortages put a great deal of pressure on Shenzhen. 
  Electric power shortages cause a great deal of inconvenience 
in the daily life of the masses and have an adverse effect on 
the prestige and credibility of the party and government. 
Initially, the reform and opening to the outside caused a great 
improvement in the people's standard of living, with 
televisions, refrigerators, electric fans and the like finding 
their way into homes. But the numerous electric power cutoffs 
and voltage cutbacks have rendered televisions and refrigerators 
unusable and have made fans into nothing more than decorative 
objects. People who want to read have to light candles. Many 
complain that "the power goes off when it's time for supper; the 
power comes on when it's time for bed," and basic-level cadres 
frequently report to their superiors that "when the lights go 
off, the family quarrels start." 
  Serious electric power shortages also create organic 
imbalances in electric power production, leaving behind a 
variety of hidden problems: 
  --Electric power is a special commodity, whose production 
and 
consumption must proceed at the same pace. In order to deal with 
increases in load, sudden malfunctions, decreases in 
hydroelectric power output during the low-water season, and the 
stoppages for routine inspection and maintenance of the 
equipment, the power grid must maintain a certain reserve 
generating capacity, usually equal to 25 percent of the total 
installed capacity (in Hong Kong the figure is between 40 and 50 
percent). This is similar to the practice of having reserve 
troops in wartime. But because of excessive electric power 
shortages, all available forces have to be thrown into the 
breach: the reserve generating equipment too, has to be put into 
action. Therefore, equipment that needs inspection and 
maintenance does not receive it in timely fashion, and some 
essentially deficient generator sets are forced to keep 
operating, which not only has a severe effect on the "health" of 
the equipment, but also leads to a pronounced increase in 
equipment malfunctions and breakdowns and results in large 
numbers of above-plan temporary equipment stoppages. The loss of 
electric energy output as a result of temporary stoppages of 
generating units with rated capacities of 100 kW or more was 
28.4 billion kWh in 1989, 30.1 billion kWh in 1990, and 29.4 
billion kWh in 1991, roughly equivalent to 6 million kWh of 
capacity a year (assuming 5,000 generating hours a year). 
  --In order to maintain the normal economic and technical 
service life of generating equipment (25 years for fossil-fired 
generator sets and 50 years for hydroelectric sets), according 
to international standards, the annual operating time of the 
equipment must be 5,000 hours or less (there is a total of 8,760 
hours in a year). In such developed countries as the United 
States, the UK, France, Germany, and Japan, the figure is 4,000 
hours or less, and in Hong Kong it is between 4,380 and 4,730 
hours. But because of China's low per capita installed 
generating capacity and the need to produce more electric power, 
the annual operating time of generating equipment in this 
country is the highest in the world. Since the Fourth 5-Year 
Plan, the annual operating time of fossil-fired generating 
equipment in this country is universally about 6,000 hours. In 
1990, the annual operating time of equipment at Shajiao A in 
Guangdong, of the power plant at Huangpu, and of major power 
plants elsewhere was over 7,000 hours, and the equipment at the 
Maoming power plant actually was in operation for 8,046 hours 
per year. In recent years, the electric power departments have 
become aware of the seriousness of putting the equipment at 
risk, and in addition, there has been a rather large increase in 
newly commissioned equipment, so that a resolute effort to 
rectify this unscientific, "exploitative" operation has been 
called for. But the electric power shortage is so severe that 
the annual operating time of generating equipment has still 
failed to decline significantly. It was 6,011 hours in 1987, 
5,907 hours in 1988, 5,716 hours in 1989, 5,413 hours in 1990, 
5,451 hours in 1991, and 5,462 hours in 1992. The consequences 
of this long-standing failure to give the equipment some rest 
can only be a shortening of operating life and an increase in 
latent problems, which constantly endanger the safe and stable 
operation of the power grid. 
  --Replacement of the old by the new is a universal law, but 
because of the long-standing electric power shortage, some 
outmoded equipment that cannot be retired on schedule. In 
China's power grid, about 33 million kW of medium- and 
low-voltage generating equipment is in need of thorough overhaul 
or modernization, and in addition, 7 million kW of seriously 
defective hydroelectric equipment and 6 million kW of 
superannuated heat supply equipment is still in operation. The 
country's rural low-voltage power distribution system is 
obsolete everywhere, and even Tian'anmen Square's power supply 
lines, which went into operation in 1959, have not been 
modernized. All of these factors adversely affect the safety, 
reliability, and economic performance of the power grid. 
  "Three feet of ice takes more than a day to freeze." It is 
inadequate investment in electric power and an inadequate scale 
of capital construction that are the true causes of the power 
shortage. An "extraordinary acceleration of development" is an 
approach that offers a hope of alleviating the electric power 
bottleneck. 
  In the late fall of 1991, Energy Minister Huang Yicheng 
visited Hunan and Hubei provinces to inspect the status of 
electric power construction. During his visit, the province 
governors asked him for more electric power, and so did the 
mayors. Even his former neighbors from his hometown of Zaoyang, 
who made a special rush trip to see him, asked him point-blank 
for more electricity. As the person in charge of China's energy 
industry at the time, Huang Yicheng had a clear awareness of the 
basic factors responsible for Central China's energy shortage. 
He said, "Central China's energy shortage is no accident: it is 
entirely due to an inadequate scale of capital construction for 
the power industry." 
  Actually, this penetrating conclusion applies equally to all 
parts of the country that have power shortages, and to China as 
a whole. 
  "To increase oil output, you have to drill wells; to 
increase 
power output, the key is to install equipment": this unadorned 
statement by old power industry hands is an incontrovertible 
truth. 
  The basic characteristic of the electric power industry is 
that it uses an extensive form of expanded reproduction to 
increase its power generating capabilities: the annual increase 
in its ability to produce electricity is equivalent to the 
number of kilowatts of equipment capacity that it adds during 
the year. But to meet the continually expanding requirements of 
the national economy and the people's livelihood, the power 
industry must maintain a coordinated proportionality between 
supply and demand. This is a measure of whether electric power 
development is forging ahead, keeping pace, or falling behind. 
  A commonly used yardstick worldwide is the "electric power 
elasticity coefficient," i.e., the ratio of the annual rate of 
increase in electric power generation to the rate of increase in 
total industrial and agricultural output value. When this 
coefficient is equal to 1, the increase in electric power 
generation and the growth of the economy are keeping pace with 
each other; if it is greater than 1, electric power is indeed 
"leading the way"; and if it is less than 1, this is cause for 
concern, because numerous power cutoffs and cutbacks are 
unavoidable. In China, since the 1970's there has never been a 
year in which the electric power elasticity coefficient reached 
1. For the most part it has been between 0.7 and 0.75. Even in 
the seven-year period from 1986 to 1992, when both installed 
generating capacity and the output of electric energy rose 
rather rapidly and when in addition there was a three-year 
period of management rectification, the average electric power 
elasticity coefficient was still less than 0.9. The value of the 
coefficient for Guangdong Province during the Sixth and Seventh 
5-Year Plans was respectively 0.56 and 0.76. With such low 
values of the elasticity coefficient, it would be surprising if 
power shortages did not occur. 
  Another widely used yardstick is the ratio of 
power-producing 
to power-using equipment, i.e., the ratio of installed 
power-generating capacity to the capacity of equipment that 
consumes electric power. If the supply and demand of electric 
power are in balance, the ratio should be 1:2, indicating that 
during the period in question, power generation capabilities 
were sufficient to meet electric power demand, and no power 
shortage existed. When the ratio is less than 1:2, power 
shortages will occur. The smaller the ratio, the more serious 
the shortages. In China, the ratio was 1:1.91 in the 1960's and 
fell below 1:2 in the 1970's. From a value of 1:2.22 in 1980, it 
decreased to 1:2.54 in 1988, then fell further to 1:2.57 in 
1989. From 1990 to 1992 the value of the ratio was consistently 
between 1:2.45 and 1:2.5. With the persistent low values of this 
ratio over a period of 20 years, serious power shortages and 
frequent power cutoffs are the natural result. 
  Some may say that we should take the long view and that, 
despite power shortages in the past and present, if the Eighth 
and Ninth 5-Year Plans are carried out, shortages may cease by 
the year 2000. 
  An authority from the power field replies that, based on 
economic statistics for the period since readjustment, the 
national electric power requirement in 1995 will be 920 billion 
kWh and that in the year 2000 will be between 1.34 and 1.47 
trillion kWh. If 68 million kW of new large- to medium-size 
generating sets is commissioned during the Eighth 5-Year Plan, 
together with a few medium-to-small size generating sets, a 
capacity of 920 billion kWh could be attained by 1995. If an 
average of 20 million kW of large- to medium-size generating 
equipment capacity is added each year during the Ninth 5-Year 
Plan, then by the year 2000, national generating capacity will 
reach 307 million kW and the output of electric energy will 
attain 1.4 trillion kWh. Clearly, attaining this objective 
involves a great deal of difficulty in such areas as raising 
funds, obtaining equipment, and adequate progress in preparatory 
work, and also depends on a balance of various external 
conditions. Furthermore, even if the above objective is 
realized, the national power shortage will not necessarily be 
fundamentally alleviated. This is because, assuming a population 
of 1.25 billion in 2000, China's per capita installed generating 
capacity will be 0.24 kW and the per capita output of electric 
energy will be only 1096 kWh: this figure is far short not only 
of the per capita values of 26,000 and 18,000 kWh attained by 
Norway and Canada, but even of the figures of 2,000 to 6,000 kWh 
attained in Eastern Europe. 
  Consider also the following analyses. 
  At the end of last year, in the spirit of the 14th Party 
Congress, comrades of the Shandong Province electric power 
office set a specific target for "having electric power lead the 
way," involving effective management and utilization of the 
existing 10 million kW of generating capacity and the 
commissioning of an additional 10 million kW of capacity in the 
next eight years. Meeting this objective will be difficult, but 
it is a stirring undertaking. However, careful calculations show 
that if this goal were realized in the year 2000, Shandong 
Province's electricity shortage would still increase from the 
current 1.5 million kW to 3 million kW, and the relative size of 
the shortfall would be virtually unchanged. 
  Not long ago, after thorough consideration of electric power 
construction projects for the Eighth 5-Year Plan and the power 
development program for the Ninth 5-Year Plan, the Beijing 
municipal electric power departments submitted to the municipal 
leadership a forecast that in the next seven years Beijing's 
electric power shortages will become more severe than they are 
today. 
  The above analyses are, of course, long-term concerns; but 
the next example involves immediate concerns. 
  Since last year, investment in the fixed assets of all 
state-owned units increased by 50 to 70 percent, but 
structurally, there was no tilt of funding toward the energy 
industries. In the last two to three years, electric power 
investments declined steadily: last year the investment in 
electric power was nearly 2 percent below that in the previous 
year. In the first half of this year [1993], investment levels 
in the transportation, posts and telecommunications, metallurgy, 
and building materials sectors showed a pronounced increase, and 
only energy investments received a declining share of total 
investment, falling by 2.9 percent, with investments in electric 
power dropping by 0.9 percent. 
  The central and local authorities have been slow in 
disbursing the electric power investments included in the state 
plan. In the first five months of this year, 40 percent of the 
year's investments should have been disbursed, but the actual 
figure was only 10.9 percent. This circumstance is unprecedented 
in the last 10 years and has caused certain electric power 
construction projects to be completely or partially idled. 
  The backlog of projects under construction has been steadily 
declining, so that the foundation of the electric power pyramid 
is not sound. Because electric power construction involves large 
investments and a long cycle (three to five years for a 
fossil-fired power plant and seven to 10 years for a 
hydroelectric station), there must be a great deal of advance 
work for power industry capital construction: the number of 
projects in the surveying and planning stage must be more than 
10 times the number that had been given authorization; the 
number of authorized projects for which construction 
preparations are being made must be in a similar proportion to 
the number of projects actually under construction; and the 
number of projects under construction must be in a similar 
proportion to the number of projects about to be commissioned. 
Only in this way will it be possible to continue commissioning 
new power generating capacities each year. Regrettably, during 
the last few years, the ratio of under-construction generating 
capacity to capacity commissioned within the year has been 
declining steadily: it was 9:1 in 1990, 5.9:1 in 1991, and 5:1 
in 1992; this year, it will fall below 5:1. 
  Both long-range and short-range concerns are being turned 
over in the minds of Minister of Electric Power Shi Dazhen and 
his four deputies. These top commanders, who have been 
inseparably connected with the electric power industry and who 
now shoulder the arduous responsibilities of China's electric 
power reform and development, took counsel together, and at a 
major Ministry of Electric Power meeting held on 28 May of this 
year they stated resoundingly that "if the electric power 
industry does not undertake an extraordinary acceleration of its 
development, it will be impossible for electric power to lead 
the way. In order for electric power to lead the way, the power 
industry must strive to make reform more thorough, because 
without reform no solution is possible." 
  Having electric power lead the way has been a consistent 
policy guideline of the central party authorities and the State 
Council. In 1953, in an annotation to the report of a party 
group in the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the CPC Central 
Committee stated that the coal, oil and electric power 
industries are the vanguard industries of the national economy. 
In the 1950's, Comrade Mao Zedong stated that electric power and 
transport facilities were the vanguard sectors. In 1985, while 
drafting recommendations for the Seventh 5-Year Plan, the CPC 
Central Committee stated that "the development of the energy 
industry must be centered on electric power." And in March 1993, 
in a political report delivered to the first session of the 
Eighth National People's Congress, Premier Li Peng stated that 
"we must vigorously develop the electric power industry." The 
statement of the Ministry of Electric Power leadership that in 
the future, the electric power industry must undertake "an 
extraordinary acceleration of its development" is consistent 
with China's conditions and with worldwide trends. In the course 
of gathering information for this article, I had the sense that 
the 2 million employees of the nation's power system are geared 
up for an extraordinary acceleration of the power industry's 
development, and that all sectors of the national economy, tired 
of electricity cutoffs and cutbacks, are eagerly looking forward 
to an early breakout from the electric power bottleneck.

5387]: "The Light-Bringers: Pressing Forward Under a Heavy 
Burden"] 
  [Text] No developed country has power shortages, and no 
country with power shortages can develop. China has had power 
shortages for 20 years, and the people have been waiting 20 
years for the electric power industry to lead the takeoff of 
other industries. 
  But the electric power industry bears heavy burdens, which 
are keeping it from taking off. 
  An annual increase of 12 million kW in installed generating 
capacity is insufficient to catch up with the increase in 
demand, and the annual electricity shortfall is still as great 
as 20 percent. The electric power industry has been operating at 
more than full load for 20 years, its equipment continues to be 
overburdened, and investments are inadequate; it lacks the 
capability to replace obsolete equipment, and damaged or 
defective generating sets continue to operate. In addition, a 
heavy debt of more than 90 billion yuan is making it difficult 
for state-owned enterprises, which are the mainstay of the power 
industry, to continue. 
  Western observers say that it would take a miracle for 
China's economy to achieve a growth rate of 10 percent or more 
with an 8 percent rate of expansion of the power industry. 
People in China's electric power industry state that "We are 
bearing up under every calamity and pressing forward under a 
heavy burden." 
<H5>  Operating at Full Load, Working at More Than Full Load </H5>
  A visitor to the Beijing No. 1 heat and power plant has 
reason for amazement. Three large generating sets that were 
commissioned in 1958 have already exceeded their rated service 
life by 150,000 to 200,000 hours. Starting in the 1970's, the 
quadrennial major overhaul has had to be replaced by an annual 
overhaul. Practically every assembly of the boilers, steam 
turbogenerators and main transformers has had repeated major 
repairs. When repair is no longer possible, they have been 
replaced one by one, so that by now all components have been 
replaced at least once. 
  In this large enterprise, which relies on its superannuated, 
aging equipment to provide power to a large part of the capital, 
overuse has caused cracks up to 82mm deep to form in the wall of 
the boiler steam jacket. The cracks have been patched by welding 
to keep the equipment operating. Wang Miaocheng, who has been a 
duty engineer at the plant for 20 years, says that each day's 
work is done with his heart in his throat. 
  The operation of worn, superannuated equipment is by no 
means 
limited to this plant. Many generator sets that were 
commissioned during the First 5-Year Plan are still in 
operation. According to statistics from the Ministry of Electric 
Power, in the current power grid, medium- and low-voltage 
generating sets representing a total capacity of 33 million kW 
are in need of thorough renovation or modernization, and, in 
addition, 7 million kW of severely deficient hydropower 
generating equipment and 6 million kW of overage heat supply 
equipment is still in operation. If you take the road north from 
the Shanhaiguan Pass, you will see the sagging cooling towers of 
old power plants; if you touch them, you will find that their 
concrete coating is scaling off. When the head of the Panmian 
electric power office in Liaoning assumed his duties, he 
discovered that the tables and chairs used for office work were 
relics of the Japanese-installed puppet government, and that the 
first domestically produced main transformer is still in 
operation. 
  Maintaining reliable output amid a multitude of perils and 
maintaining a superior record of full-load operation have long 
been the daily reality in China's electric power industry. 
  In order to alleviate China's electric power shortage, the 
power industry has always taken full generation and full 
delivery as its guidelines. For 20 years, the industry and the 
electric power enterprises, like the Beijing No. 1 heat and 
power plant, have consistently been operating at full capacity, 
with no breathing space. The national average annual number of 
hours of operation of fossil-fired generating sets is 6,000 
hours; some newly constructed power plants operate their 
equipment for 7,000 hours or more a year; and in a few cases, 
the length of operation reaches 8,000 hours, far above the 
international standard of 5,000 hours per year. 
  Behind this equipment-risking, exploitative mode of 
operation, to which there is no alternative, the electric power 
industry is also afflicted with inadequate equipment maintenance 
capabilities owing to depreciation rates that are below the 
national average. As a consequence, equipment overhauls must be 
extremely stringent and careful: they constitute a succession of 
intense struggles to gain a little more time and a little more 
quality. It is common for employees to work round the clock or 
to be on the job for a week without returning to their homes. A 
power plant director under the North China electric power 
office, who had spent several days and nights riveted to the 
site of a rush repair job, collapsed from exhaustion after the 
generating set finally rumbled back into operation. 
  An accident resulting from a violation of regulations at the 
Hefei heat and power plant shocked the Ministry of Electric 
Power. Four persons were killed. But the comrades of the 
investigating board could hardly bring themselves to take 
action. At the time, two generating sets at the plant were being 
overhauled, and a mass of coal slag suddenly became hung up in 
the one unit that was still in operation. If the generator had 
stopped, there would have been a major emergency. As a 
consequence, the plant directory and the operating crew put 
themselves in harm's way, trying to prod loose the suspended 
slag inside the hot furnace. The slag, at a temperature of over 
1000 degrees, fell down and crushed them. 
  The situation in the power grid is even more difficult than 
that in the power plants. 
  The country's urban and rural low-voltage power distribution 
network is universally outmoded. A considerable fraction of 
China's old municipal power networks have been in operation for 
25 years or more, and some have been operating for 40 years. The 
bustling city center of Shanghai is still using power 
distribution equipment left over from the 1920's and 1930's; 30 
percent of the utility poles are at or above the maximum rated 
load, voltages are too low, and breakdowns are frequent. 
  In Dalian, Fushun, Shenyang, and Changchun, power 
distribution equipment left over from the Japanese puppet regime 
continues in use. In Beijing, emergency shutdowns caused by the 
aging power delivery facilities are almost a daily occurrence. 
The seriously aging power lines in Tian'anmen Square are now 
carrying five times the load for which they were designed. The 
insulation is peeling from wires that have been in operation for 
more than 30 years. Six years ago, the electric power 
departments proposed a program to replace this equipment, but it 
was shelved owing to lack of funding. 
  People not in the industry have difficulty in comprehending 
that every success in the onerous task of power delivery is 
ultimately the result of "human wave" tactics in which personnel 
at all levels pitch in together. When the Asian Games were held 
in Beijing, the electric power departments mobilized a huge 
"militia," posting one person at each utility pole between the 
power plant and the site of the games in order to assure timely 
detection and rectification of malfunctions. 
  Behind the full-load provision of light is an effort at more 
than full load by the machinery and personnel. 
<H5>  A Virtually Insuperable Debt </H5>
  Corresponding to the equipment that cannot be modernized is 
a 
mounting debt. At the end of 1992, the major state-owned 
enterprises of the Ministry of Electric Power had a debt of 96.7 
billion yuan. 
  The fixed assets of the Ministry of Electric Power's East 
China Electric Corporation are the greatest of the country's 500 
large enterprises, but the debt of the Northeast China power 
grid is fully 10.5 billion yuan, with an annual interest of 550 
million yuan; the total operating profit of the power grid in 
1991 was only 50 million yuan. 
  After decades of struggle and devotion by their employees, 
well-known large enterprises that provide the power on which 
other enterprises rely for survival are making insufficient 
profits to pay even a fraction of the bank interest on their 
debts; they must wage an agonizing struggle to survive under 
their crushing indebtedness and its steadily compounding 
interest. 
  It should be noted that for several decades, the electric 
power enterprises were well off. But since the policy of 
replacing allocations by loans was instituted in the 1980's, and 
especially since the second stage of replacing profit payments 
by taxes was instituted, the tax rate on the electric power 
industry has been increased from 15 percent to 25 percent; the 
combination of a high tax burden, high operating costs, and low 
prices have made the state-owned electric power enterprises 
increasingly hard pressed. 
  As of 1990, the ministry's electric power enterprises were 
able to retain only 8.2 yuan of every 100 yuan of earnings. At 
the same time, prices for coal, oil, rail haulage and other 
transport were repeatedly adjusted upwards, and the prices of 
water, materials, and equipment rose steadily, so that the cost 
of producing electric power skyrocketed. In 1978, the cost of 
producing 1000 kWh of electric energy was 31.55 yuan, but by 
1992 the cost of producing 1000 kWh in the 
Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power system had risen to 96.03 yuan; 
meanwhile, the prices charged for electric power remained 
basically unchanged. 
  As a result of high taxes, high costs, and low prices, in 
the 
course of a decade the profitability rate of funds in the 
state-owned electric power enterprises declined steadily, from 
12 percent in 1980 to 3.7 percent in 1991. The enterprises' 
borrowed funds correspondingly lost their ability to generate 
earnings sufficient to repay principal and interest, and the 
indebtedness of the large state-owned enterprises mounted 
rapidly, at a rate of 15 to 20 billion yuan a year, snowballing 
into a loan that could never be paid off. 
  Since the bad practices of the old enterprises are so 
difficult to eradicate, can new construction projects bring 
about a beneficial cycle? 
  The repayment period for Gezhouba is 24 years, with an 
annual 
principal and interest payment of 300 to 500 million yuan, but 
the total profit of the Gezhouba power station since it went 
into operation has been no more than 200 million yuan. The Dahua 
hydroelectric station and the Heshan fossil-fired power plant, 
newly constructed in Guangxi, have made a significant 
contribution to alleviating the electric power shortage in the 
area, but the annual loan interest alone for the two plants is 
150 million yuan while the annual profit of the entire Guangxi 
power grid is only 60 million yuan. 
  As the number of construction projects increases and as 
deliveries of electric power rise, the cost of producing power 
increases. As the contribution that the electric power 
enterprises make to the state and localities grows, the debt 
burden that they carry becomes steadily heavier. 
  The difficulty of achieving a beneficial cycle is casting a 
dark shadow over the development of the electric power industry. 
In the first five months of 1993, less than 11 percent of the 
funds allocated for power construction nationwide were actually 
disbursed. There are, of course, many reasons, but everyone is 
calculating economic benefits, and who is willing to pour money 
into a bottomless pit? The failure to increase construction 
affects not only the present, but the future as well. 
  We hope for a full supply of electric power as one hopes for 
rain clouds after a long drought. 
<H5>  Electric Power Quality: A Difficult Task </H5>
  The burden of electric power enterprises is not limited to 
their debt of more than 90 billion yuan: another factor is the 
heavy sense of responsibility for improving the quality of 
China's overall supply of electric power. 
  In Japan, interruptions of electric power to users total 
less 
than two hours a year. In the United States, they are a maximum 
of five to eight hours a year, and likewise in Europe. In China, 
for many years there have been power shortages 15 to 20 percent 
of the time, and in some provinces even 30 percent of the time. 
The only way to deal with them is to cut off the power or to cut 
back the supply. In 1992, as a result of these stoppages, the 
country lost between 500 and 700 billion yuan of output value. 
And behind this calculable loss there is another hidden loss. A 
decline in the quality of the electric power supply as a result 
of excessive load and below-standard frequency slows down 
machine tools and causes unevenness of yarn in textile mills and 
fading of colors in dyeing plants. These phenomena directly 
affect the quality of China's manufactured goods, and the 
intermediate hidden loss involved cannot be expressed in 
numerical terms. 
  One year, a brilliant soccer game was being played in 
Shenyang. Just as one of the players made a kick toward the 
goal, the electric power suddenly went off. Shenyang went dark, 
the live broadcast stopped, and soccer fans all over the country 
were enraged. 
  In Sheqi County, Henan, on one occasion the peasants left 
their wheat fields and walked 10 miles to burst into the 
electric power office and demand electricity. The conflicts of 
the energy shortage are concentrated in the electric power 
departments. In Guizhou, in order to maintain the prescribed 
frequency and to assure grid safety, a scheduler acting under 
orders from his superiors cut off the power to an enterprise 
that used excessive amounts of electric power. As a result, he 
was arrested and charged with "sabotaging production." 
  In response, the electric power departments have done 
everything possible to resolve conflicts in a realistic spirit 
of "Don't wait, don't rely on others, don't bear a grudge," and 
have displayed profound understanding of society's "lack of 
understanding." From the original Ministry of Energy to the 
present-day Ministry of Electric Power, they have treated the 
work of supplying urban and rural dwellers with electric power 
for their daily needs as a matter of "promoting stability and 
unity and motivating the masses to build socialism." On two 
occasions they have issued regulations on maintaining the supply 
of electricity for daily needs and for lighting to the urban and 
rural populace. 
  Assuring lighting means putting pressure on industrial 
production, which is a matter that requires infinitely 
painstaking planning. 
  A tiny power-management office in the town of Niudu, Linyi 
County, Shanxi, created an approach that later was widely 
disseminated. At the time when the populace was making its peak 
use of electric lights, the office shut off nondomestic power 
supplies to assure that light would be available, and at the 
peak period of power consumption for purposes other than 
lighting, it made all possible efforts to assure that power 
would be available for production. It signed notarized electric 
power contracts with the users. The power supply office in 
Fucheng County, Hebei, made even more detailed regulations and 
installed meters to keep track of power use in periods when 
limitations were imposed. The local problem of "having the power 
go off just when dinner was served and seeing the sign-off when 
you turned on the television" was set right. The leadership and 
rank-and-file of many power industry offices in the country not 
only have a thorough knowledge of the industry, but are 
conversant with the circumstances of the local enterprises, 
services, and units. In addition to managing electric power 
effectively, they cannot avoid becoming involved in arranging 
social life as a whole. China's electric power industry and its 
personnel truly are called upon to shoulder too heavy a burden. 
  Don't wait, don't depend on others, don't bear a grudge. Put 
out all your strength and effort, assure that the existing 
facilities are used with high efficiency. This spirit is 
precious and commands respect. It is this spirit of putting up 
with humiliation to perform one's mission and of continually 
driving oneself that supports China's ability to use its 
8-percent rate of increase in electric power output to provide 
light and heat for a 10-percent growth rate of the national 
economy. 
  But we can also see that the call for the power industry to 
get into a beneficial cycle is essential to assuring the 
sustained, stable, rapid development of China's economy.

<F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporters Tang Liliang [3282 2621 </F>
2733] and Wang Haiyong [3769 3189 0737]: "Electricity Prices: 
How Are We To Understand Them?"] 
  [Text] Electricity prices are a subject that urgently needs 
examination. 
  Opinions on the subject vary. Some people are satisfied: 
This 
year everything else is going up, but household-use electricity 
prices are steady. The price of household electric power in the 
Beijing region is 0.164 yuan per kilowatt-hour (including a 
municipal public service fee of 0.14 yuan which goes into local 
revenues). This was the price in 1958 and this was the price in 
the first half of this year. 
  Some people complain that state-set electricity prices are 
too low, and that there is an urgent need to raise them. Some 
people are angry: "Going up again? It's costing us about a yuan 
per kilowatt-hour already. Is there any rhyme or reason to it?" 
  Some people sound a warning note: "There's already a lot of 
pressure to raise everything, so they shouldn't be in any hurry 
to raise electricity prices." 
  Some people are impatient: "I'm not in the mood to talk 
about 
the price of electricity: what I'm concerned with is the power 
shortage. The power's just on and off here. Why doesn't the 
state put a little more effort into it?" 
  Everybody thinks that he is right. In the past few years, 
the 
reform of the price of electricity has made some progress and 
has taken a few steps. The program for more thorough reform of 
electricity prices that was issued this July resulted in a rise 
in household electricity prices, which had been steady for 
several decades. It, too, brought forth a chorus of differing 
opinions. Just what are we to think about electricity prices? 
<H3>  If State Electricity Prices Are Not Adjusted, the Electric 
Power Industry Will Lose Money Across the Board </H3>
  The electric power industry relies on the extensive form of 
expanded reproduction: the more power you want to generate, the 
more equipment you need; and the more equipment you need, the 
larger the investment that is required. Where does the 
investment come from? 
  That the electric power industry should rely primarily on 
the 
funds that it accumulates itself and should engage in 
self-supporting development is a basic principle of electric 
power development throughout the world. In Japan, 80 percent of 
the funding for the expanded reproduction of the 10 largest 
companies is furnished by the companies themselves. 
  But countries differ greatly in their circumstances. China's 
centrally subordinate power companies had a debt of fully 96.7 
billion yuan at the end of 1992 and the amount is rising at a 
rate of more than 10 billion yuan a year. This crushing burden 
gives them no breathing space. 
  The principal cause of the problem is the price of 
electricity. 
  Up to 1985, power industry construction in China was 
supported primarily by the central authorities, and the 
electricity price structure was uniform, with the prices set by 
the state (i.e., directive pricing). When the prices of fuel and 
transportation were raised, there was a corresponding rise in 
the price charged for electric power; thus, state-specified 
prices for electric power, which had not previously been 
adjusted, rose somewhat. 
  Although the rise in the price of electric power compensated 
most of the great increase in power production costs that was 
brought about by increased fuel and transportation prices, the 
contribution of materials and equipment to power production 
costs had to be covered entirely by the enterprises themselves, 
and, as a result, the full cost of power production was still 
not adequately compensated by the price of electricity. In 1992, 
the cost of producing a kilowatt-hour of electricity in the 
centrally subordinate power companies was 2.5 times what it had 
been in 1980, but the average price charged for electricity had 
increased by a factor of only 1.3. As a consequence, the profit 
on each unit sold had decreased by 50 percent. The profitability 
rate of funds was 14.5 percent in 1985 but only 3.13 percent in 
1992, far lower than the current Construction Bank interest rate 
on loans for electric power construction (11.16 percent for 
periods of five years or more). All of the earnings so arduously 
accumulated by the centrally subordinate power companies were 
inadequate to cover even the interest on the loans. Under last 
year's conditions, they lost nearly 20 yuan on each 100 yuan of 
expenditures. Since they were unable to accumulate funds, an 
infusion of funds from outside was unlikely. 
  After the policy of replacing state allocations by loans was 
instituted in 1980, it was long impossible to recover electric 
power construction funds invested by the central authorities, 
and it became increasingly difficult to increase investments in 
electric power. In 1991, investments by the central authorities 
had fallen to 45.6 percent of total national investments in 
capital construction for electric power, compared with 81.6 
percent in 1985. 
  Borrowing money from banks was even more difficult. 
Recently, 
new bank loans, even for state key electric power construction 
projects, often required a great deal of coordinating work by 
the relevant departments before the banks could be induced to 
agree. It is not surprising that the banks were unwilling to 
provide the money, because the power companies were not in a 
position to repay it. By the end of 1991, the bank debt of the 
electric power industry had reached 30.9 billion yuan. 
  In 1992, when the World Bank voted on the evaluation of the 
Zou Xian (Shandong) power plant project, the U.S. representative 
abstained; one of the chief reasons was that the price charged 
for electric power was too low. 
  To compensate for the inadequate investment in capital 
construction for the power industry, between 1988 and 1991 the 
Ministry of Electric Power was authorized to issue more than 7 
billion yuan in bonds of various types to the public; the 
accumulated capital and interest on these bonds was more than 10 
billion yuan. This year, with repayment at its peak, more than 6 
billion yuan is required. Unless new prices for electricity are 
instituted, where will this more than 6 billion yuan come from? 
If the industry cannot pay off its old debts, how will it be 
able to issue new bonds? 
  The time has come for adjustment of the seriously inadequate 
directive prices for electricity. 
<H3>  The Climate Is Excellent for Raising Funds for Electric 
Power; Prices Are the Key to Loan Repayment </H3>
  In view of the threadbare state of the centrally subordinate 
electric power companies, in 1985 the central authorities issued 
a new policy encouraging more organizations to produce power and 
instituted diversified electricity prices. As a result, the 
Huaneng group went into the power business, localities invested 
in power production, and joint power production bodies sprang up 
vigorously, producing an excellent situation. The key to raising 
funds for power production is "loan-repayment" power prices, or, 
in other words, prices sufficiently high that the power 
companies will be able to repay their loans and interest on 
time: these are "guided" rather than directive prices. This 
pricing system not only gave the investors access to electric 
power, but assured them of profits when the loan and interest 
were repaid. When the policy of diversified electricity prices 
was instituted, there was an abundant influx of funds: the 
diverse electricity prices policy not only made the Huaneng 
Group, which used primarily foreign capital, essentially capable 
of self-sustaining growth, but also brought about a burst of 
enthusiasm for local power production. In 1992, generating sets 
for which the investment funds came from the localities, 
enterprises, and foreign capital accounted for two-thirds of all 
newly commissioned sets nationwide. 
  Electricity is a unique commodity. It cannot be stored and 
it 
must be consumed as it is generated, and thus optimized power 
grid layout and scheduling are needed in order to achieve the 
maximum economic effect from the generation and circulation of 
electric power. It must be admitted that the policy of allowing 
fund raising for power production promoted the development of 
the power industry, and revealed a new mechanism for power 
generation, and has resulted in successful experience. But we 
now know that before the new situation had taken shape, 
uncoordinated efforts to raise funds and go into power 
production also led to abuses. The investors called the tune and 
tended to emphasize their own particular benefits, which in turn 
sacrificed the overall interests of the power grid, so that it 
was difficult to assure optimization of the power grid and 
implementation of state energy policy. 
  But why should we not make this sovereign remedy of 
loan-repayment pricing available to the centrally subordinate 
power-industry departments, so that they too will have the clout 
to raise funds for power production? 
<H3>  Experience Shows That the People Can Bear Electricity Price 
Reforms </H3>
  A rise in the centrally controlled power companies, which 
account for 70 percent of the national total, will not be a 
trivial matter. The power industry is a basic industry, and if 
the prices charged by a basic industry are adjusted, price rises 
throughout the economy may result, and the people's livelihood 
may be affected. The state is taking a cautious approach to such 
matters. At present, the prices of coal and of most other raw 
materials, as well as the prices of grains and edible oils, have 
been allowed to float, and electricity price reform is bringing 
up the rear. 
  But just how great an effect will changes in electricity 
prices produce? 
  It is calculated that, given the fluctuations in the prices 
of coal and transportation, if loan-repayment prices were 
instituted in one step, the national average price of electric 
power would have to increase by only 34 percent above the 1992 
price, or about 0.05 yuan. 
  Assuming that a family of three consumes 60 kWh of 
electricity a month, an increase of 0.05 yuan per kWh would mean 
an additional outlay of 3 yuan per month, equivalent to one 
serving of ice cream per family member. 
  In the case of the enterprises, an adjustment of the price 
of 
electricity would have a large effect only on those with high 
power consumption, but these represent only a small fraction of 
all enterprises nationwide, and since their product prices have 
already been allowed to float and to come into line with 
international market prices, they are fairly well situated to 
bear an adjustment of the price of electricity. 
  In certain economically developed regions with significant 
power shortages, people are well acquainted with "high 
electricity prices." To meet the needs of economic development, 
these regions have made extensive use of small fossil-fired 
power plants. The fuel consumption of these plants is an order 
of magnitude higher than that of large fossil-fired plants, and 
the prices that they charge for electricity are correspondingly 
higher. Guangdong Province has 1 million kW of kerosene-fired 
generating equipment, and the cost of the electricity produced 
by these plants is as high as 1 yuan per kWh. Shenzhen 
instituted new prices for electricity as early as 1989, and 
users all stated that the price reform was necessary and that 
they could tolerate it. Experience shows that the more highly 
developed a region's economy, the greater the ability of the 
users to tolerate increased electricity prices. 
<H5>  Adjust Electricity Pricing, But Rectify It Well </H5>
  Electricity prices vary from place to place; this is 
acceptable, because at present the distribution of primary 
energy resources is not in balance (electricity produced by 
fossil-fired power plants is a secondary energy resource that 
has been converted from coal and other primary energy 
resources). If loan-repayment electricity prices are instituted, 
a rational average nationwide electricity price level would be 
about 0.30 yuan per kWh; a price level of 0.5 to 0.6 yuan would 
be very high. At this point, some readers may exclaim, "Our 
electricity prices are well above that!" 
  It is true: in many areas of the country, primarily rural 
areas, the prices that users are actually paying for electricity 
have long exceeded the loan-repayment price. It is reported that 
rural electricity prices on Hainan Island were rectified, 
lowering them from 1.35 yuan to about 0.8 yuan per kWh. The 
highest prices on rural Hainan Island exceeded 4 yuan per kWh. 
Excessive prices for electricity have forced the peasants in 
certain areas to go back to oil lamps in place of electric 
lights. 
  Why is it that these electricity prices are so much above 
the 
standard? While in some locations power generation costs are 
indeed very high, the primary reason is that electricity price 
management is chaotic, and, in particular, that guided 
electricity prices are out of control in some localities. 
  There are more than 10 state-approved categorized guidance 
prices for electricity. Many provinces and municipalities 
implement an overall use surcharge to guidance prices, in which 
the price excess above the directive prices is spread out over 
the power use of the entire area. Because most of the income 
from guidance prices for electricity is available for local 
distribution, if local governments at various levels approve 
guidance prices, the result may be the setting of high prices, 
price increases at each level, and collection of increased fees 
for electric power. Because electric power payments are easy to 
collect under the rubric of fees, a great variety of local 
policies involving "piggyback" fees have emerged: "Surcharges 
are a basket that you can put wherever you need it." Some 
localities even include birth control fees, highway construction 
fees and entertainment fees in the price of electricity. There 
are also cases when electricity fees for goodwill, influence, 
and connections are imposed on users. Thus electricity fees have 
become a catchall for a multitude of charges. In one city, the 
combined price rise included fully 35 components. One fee 
collector told a reporter: "It used to be that when you 
collected the electricity fee, you wrote out a bill; now you 
write out a whole stack of them." 
  The director of the Guomian No. 3 power plant in Jinan said 
angrily, "The enterprises are paying more money for electricity, 
but is this money really being used to support power-industry 
construction?" 
  The electric power departments also have their complaints. 
Director Qi Xinpei [2058 2450 1014] of the Jinan Power Supply 
Office stated: "Some users are accusing us of disguised robbery, 
but they don't realize that we are actually collecting the money 
for others: we're just the scapegoats." 
  It would appear that while adjusting electricity prices, we 
should also rectify pricing and prescribe uniform electricity 
price management standards. Otherwise, a plethora of 
"electricity tigers" will open their jaws, and the situation 
will become intolerable for everyone. 
<H5>  Electricity Prices Will Not Rise Sharply </H5>
  A kilowatt-hour of electricity can be used to produce 
several 
yuan or even several dozen yuan of industrial output value, but 
its price is only a few hundredths or tenths of a yuan. Those 
who understand the situation consider that the time has come for 
price adjustment. 
  There has been some psychological preparation for the 
adjustment of electricity prices. Many plant directors have 
stated that so long as they get enough electricity, they will 
put up with any price in preference to power outages. 
  Many members of the public state that they would prefer air 
conditioning to low electricity prices. But some comrades are 
concerned that since the electric power industry is highly 
monopolistic, if electricity prices are allowed to float, they 
might rise precipitously. This concern is unwarranted, however. 
Although the power industry must adapt to a market economy, it 
is a public utility; all countries have strict electricity 
pricing principles, and as public utilities, the power companies 
are not permitted to earn high profits. What profit rate is 
suitable for electric power enterprises? Experts believe that in 
this country, an average profitability rate of funds in the 
range of 12 to 15 percent would promote the self-supporting 
development of the electric power industry. Head of the Ministry 
of Electric Power's pricing office Huang Yongda [7806 3057 6671] 
believes that, "In the future, China should adopt a funds 
profitability model when evaluating and adjusting electricity 
prices." 
  This July, the State Council approved a new electricity 
price 
reform program which raised the standards for price increases 
based on the costs of coal and transportation; in addition the 
central authorities took the initial steps toward loan-repayment 
prices and approved the first increases in household electricity 
prices. Furthermore, the accumulated price rises based on the 
cost of coal and transportation will be combined in the list 
price for electricity, providing an excellent basis for the 
rationalization of electricity prices. We are told that in the 
next few years, the Ministry of Electric Power plans to reform 
the procedure for increasing prices on the basis of coal and 
transportation costs, to implement loan-repayment pricing across 
the board, to institute peak and off-peak electricity pricing, 
and ultimately to arrive at rational pricing. Electricity 
prices are the lifeline that will bring the power industry to a 
beneficial cycle. 
  Aristotle stated, "Give me a place to stand and I will move 
the earth." 
  A high official in the Ministry of Electric Power stated: 
"Give us the electricity price lever, and we will make the power 
industry take off."

"The Huaneng Group: An Attractive New Mechanism"] 
  [Text] Eight years ago, when the Huaneng organization was 
first created, very few had high hopes for it; but its 
organizers planned to use the excellent opportunity provided by 
reform and opening to the outside, together with state funds for 
replacing oil consumption by coal consumption, in an attempt to 
take a new approach to power production. Top officials of the 
State Council gave it their vigorous support. 
  In eight years, the organization has succeeded and has 
snowballed into China's Huaneng Group, whose central activities 
include the basic industries of electric power production and 
coal. 
  After eight years, Minister of Electric Power Shi Dazhen 
says 
that the entire electric power industry should follow the 
Huaneng Group's lead. 
<H3>  The Huaneng Phenomenon: A High Starting Point, High Speed, 
High Standards, and High Benefits, Exemplifying the Best, the 
Most Successful, and the Most Valuable </H3>
  The first stage of Huaneng's Shidongkou No. 2 power plant in 
Shanghai, with two 600,000-kW supercritical fossil-fired 
generating units, was imported from the United States and 
Sweden. Eighteen large Chinese enterprises from various sectors 
participated in its design, construction, installation and 
adjustment, and the high degree of automation of generating set 
operation and control and the overall high technological 
standards not only make the plant a pace-setter in this country, 
but put it on a par with the world state of the art. Its 
high-efficiency operation and low coal consumption continue to 
be astonishing. This exemplifies the high starting point of 
Huaneng projects. 
  At Huaneng's Dezhou power plant, two domestically produced 
300,000-kW generator sets were connected into the grid and 
started producing power within a year; its Fuzhou and Dalian 
power plants, with imported 350,000 kW generator sets, were 
built and put into operation in only 24 months. In the past, the 
domestic construction cycle for a power plant of this size was 
usually about three years. This exemplifies the high speed of 
Huaneng's construction projects. 
  According to previous state staffing standards, Huaneng's 
Dalian power plant should have required a staff of about 1,200; 
but Huaneng followed foreign management models and specified a 
staff of 488. After the plant was commissioned, this staff was 
decreased to 443 in 1991, and to 308 in 1992, and is now 280, 
but safe, high-efficiency operation is maintained throughout the 
plant, and it is a leader in many performance indicators. This 
exemplifies Huaneng's high management standards. At Huaneng's 
Shang'an power plant, the more than 150 persons who engaged in a 
concurrent construction and modernization effort brought the 
plant rapidly to full output and posted a high labor 
productivity figure of 240,000 yuan for all personnel. This 
exemplifies the high benefits obtained from Huaneng's operations. 
  Every one of Huaneng's power plants has some unusual 
features. 
  This is the attractiveness of the Huaneng Group. It has 
posted record after record for power plant construction and 
management in China. 
  In addition, it has written a brilliant page in its own 
history. 
  The organization of the group is as follows: it has 11 
component corporations and nearly 200 component enterprises. 
  Its total capital has increased from less than 2 billion 
yuan 
at registration to a current value of 39.9 billion yuan. 
  The group's installed generating equipment includes a 
completed or under-construction capacity of more than 17 million 
kW, with 1.5 to 2 million kW of capacity commissioned each year; 
this year it will contribute about a fifth of the country's 
newly commissioned capacity. Over the course of three years, its 
generating capacity has increased by a factor of 1.9. 
  Its profits were 270 million yuan in 1989, 480 million yuan 
in 1990, 660 million yuan in 1991, and 1 billion yuan in 1992. 
  With the large and medium-size state-owned power companies 
limping along, how is it that Huaneng is able to stand head and 
shoulders above the rest? 
<H3>  Huaneng's Advantage: Two Strong Legs from Birth, Use of 
Investments and Financing Strength To Increase Its Vigor, 
Rational Electricity Pricing that Moves It Rapidly Toward the 
Market Economy </H3>
  When head of the North China Power Industry Management 
Office 
Jiao Yi'an [3542 0310 1344] discussed the key factor responsible 
for the difficulties that the large and medium-size state-owned 
electric power enterprises are experiencing in stimulating their 
vitality, he frowned: "They lack investment strength, financing 
strength, and rational prices." 
  This is the common problem of all state-owned electric power 
enterprises. 
  They all express interest in the Huaneng mechanism. 
  This is because Huaneng has taken a step forward. An 
official 
of the group stated: "We benefited from the policy of reform and 
opening to the outside." There is no question that this policy 
gave Huaneng vitality and provided it with two strong legs, so 
that from the beginning it has been able to stride powerfully 
ahead and advance toward the market-economy path. 
  To start, Huaneng created an operating mechanism which was 
basically suited to the socialist market economy, and in the 
course of its development, it has made use of special state loan 
funds, relevant state policies, and its "four autonomies" 
(independent operation, independent profit-and-loss operation, 
self-development, and self-restraint) to strengthen itself 
continuously, making itself a leader in China's reform of the 
basic-industry investment system. 
  Huaneng has investment and financing strengths. It combines 
the motivated character of local power generation, domestic 
raising of funds, the accumulation of funding from a variety of 
sources, and collective power generation, and it promotes safe 
and effective project implementation and enterprise operation. 
It can attract extensive foreign capital and can be selective on 
international financial markets. It carries on combined 
commercial, technical, credit and trade negotiations, thus 
transacting a great deal of business at a small cost. We recall 
that in the group's early days, a certain domestic power plant 
paid US$199 million to import two 350,000-kW generator sets, but 
Huaneng paid only $183 million, and in addition it bought $30 
million worth of spare parts and obtained rather low loan rates. 
  The group charges electricity prices that are basically 
consistent with the law of value: the state permits it to adjust 
prices as necessary. Huaneng's main funding sources are state 
special-project loans, foreign capital, and domestically raised 
funds, in approximately equal proportions, all obtained on a 
compensation basis: Huaneng is both the borrower and the 
repayer, and it is the entity that enjoys the profits or bears 
the losses. In its domestic construction loans, the interest 
rate is in line with construction industry standards; its 
foreign capital is borrowed at international financing interest 
rates. In addition, the materials used on its construction 
projects and the materials and fuels that it uses for power 
production are mostly procured on the market at a negotiated 
price. Were it not for Huaneng's relatively rational electricity 
pricing, its enterprises would not be able to survive, to say 
nothing of carrying on expanded reproduction. The formula is: a 
loan and interest repayment component, a high-priced materials 
component, and a fixed, rational profit. Ultimately, the group 
must maintain a certain expanded reproduction capability to 
provide it with staying power. 
  If these two strong legs could be grown by all state-owned 
electric power enterprises, the power industry's growth rate 
probably would be more than a mere 8%. 
<H3>  The Huaneng Mechanism: A Strong Loan Repayment Orientation 
and Close Ties of Each Individual to His Job as Prerequisites to 
Overall Vitality </H3>
  Huaneng's overall size is huge: its total worth is 39.9 
billion yuan. But only about 10 percent, or slightly over 4 
billion yuan, is the amount that actually belongs to the group: 
more than 35 billion yuan represents debts, both foreign and 
domestic. Thus Huaneng is operating under debt. 
  It is carrying an immense burden. 
  Although Huaneng's debt repayment capacity is already 3 
billion yuan a year, its newly undertaken debt is also equal to 
3 billion yuan. 
  Since it needs both to lighten its debt burden and to take 
on 
new burdens, Huaneng is developing dialectically and this way is 
producing both benefits and electric power. Its characteristic 
feature is that pressure and dynamism stimulate each other and 
that interests and risks constrain each other. 
  Huaneng established a management model in which investment 
and operations are integrated. Thus a situation in which "others 
borrow the money and we have to pay off the debt" can never 
occur under this model. Huaneng gives the onerous term 
"repayment" a new interpretation: operation under debt and the 
market risk mechanism prompt it to give top priority to 
investment benefits, with forward and backward continuity of 
borrowing, investment, construction and operations during each 
step. Fortunately, Huaneng has an independent operations policy: 
the state approves the projects and puts together the financing 
package, but Huaneng calls the tune in all other respects; the 
only requirement is that it produce benefits. Here are two 
examples. When a coil failed at the Fuzhou power plant, the 
company immediately contacted the civil aviation department and 
rented an airplane to bring a replacement coil from Japan. Was 
it worth the cost? Yes, because one day's stoppage of the power 
plant meant a loss of 700,000 yuan, and the stoppage of a week 
that is common practice would have been entirely intolerable. 
Again, every day's delay in the commissioning of two 350,000-kW 
generating sets means a loss of US $50,000 together with the 
payment of 50,000 yuan in interest; thus, in order to shorten 
the construction time and increase benefits, Huaneng has 
instituted bonuses for completion of construction ahead of 
schedule. For some plants, the construction organizations can 
obtain a bonus of 100,000 yuan for each day that the 
construction is completed ahead of schedule. 
  Huaneng has an effective and vigorous internal operating 
mechanism whose unique property is that the group is bound 
together by property relationships; the central company and the 
component enterprises have a mother-daughter relationship or a 
controlling-interest or partner relationship. Other than the 
Huaneng International Electric Power Corporation, which is a 
Chinese-foreign joint capital operation, the Huaneng group 
guarantees a graduated rate of remitted profits to the higher 
levels, in which the percentages of excess earnings that are 
allocated to the total contract amount and to total wage are 
linked to the amount of profits tax paid, the amount of 
electricity generated, and the amount of coal transported, with 
an effort to move into line with international practice. Each 
year, the corporation pays a graduated rate of 10 percent of 
profits to the government, higher than the 7.2 percent rate paid 
by the Shougang Iron and Steel Works; the enterprise and the 
state divide the remainder in 30:70 proportions. If the 
company's profits increase by 1 percent, wages are increased by 
0.7 percent. Close profit-and-loss relationships between the 
company and the state, the enterprise and the group, and the 
employee and the enterprise have been set up. The human factor 
has been assigned a highly rational part in the development of 
production. Production relations have been streamlined, thus 
guaranteeing the group's strong market competitiveness. 
<H3>  Huaneng's Path: Still Expanding, Standing the Test of the 
Steadily Improving Socialist Market Economy, Continually 
Improving Itself </H3>
  Basic-industry projects involve large investments, long 
construction times, low profit rates, and a slow return on 
investment, and they must have a relatively stable source of 
funding if smooth progress on the projects is to be assured. In 
the eight years of Huaneng's operation, in addition to using 
foreign capital and locally raised funds, it has relied for its 
construction funds primarily on loans for the replacement of oil 
by coal. Starting this year, because the state has decided to 
"bring oil prices into line once and for all," these loans have 
been greatly decreased, and many projects currently under 
construction face the danger of suspension or stretching out of 
the investments. This year, the size of the scheduled state loan 
to Huaneng for replacement of oil by coal was 2 billion yuan. 
Ultimately it will be able to disburse only 900 million yuan, 
but the amount actually disbursed in the first half-year will be 
only slightly more than 200 million yuan. Thus Huaneng too is 
facing a funds shortage. 
  Huaneng therefore laid its emphasis on opening up direct and 
indirect financing channels. It is now making arrangements for 
the establishment of experimental joint-stock enterprises and is 
arranging for the existing Huaneng Finance Corporation to have 
expanded functions. It has vigorously sought cooperation with 
international investment groups and has opened up more funding 
avenues. In May of this year, the Russell 20/20 Group, which is 
the largest retirement fund in the United States, visited China 
and reached an agreement in principle to enter a 
power-generation partnership with Huaneng. The Huaneng 
International Electric Power Development Corporation has also 
discussed joint-capital power generation with investment groups 
in the United States and Hong Kong; it is currently organizing 
some of its plants in Shandong into a joint-stock corporation 
for entry into overseas markets; and it has opened new channels 
that will allow it to utilize foreign capital. 
  Huaneng's new objective in power generation is to install 15 
million kW of new generating capacity by the year 2000 and to 
help the country free itself from its severe stagnation in 
electric power, so that this vanguard sector can truly break out 
of its bottleneck and move ahead.

"Electricity from the Northwest: A Report on Power-Industry 
Construction in Nei Monggol"] 
  [Text] Nei Monggol's electric power industry is developing 
rapidly, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan and Northeast China 
regions are continuously obtaining electricity for lighting and 
heat from Nei Monggol. 
<H3>  Power Shortages: An Opportunity for Electric Power 
Development in the West </H3>
  China's power shortages have continued for many years, and 
in 
particular, since a new round of rapid economic development 
began, the sluggishness of the electric power industry has 
become increasingly serious. 
  When the state announced the policy decision that the 
country's energy development strategy should shift toward the 
West, the party committee and government of the Nei Monggol 
Autonomous Region wasted no time in setting the guidelines of 
making coal-fired power production the pace-setter and having 
the power industry stimulate both coal industry development and 
the comprehensive development of the economy. Nei Monggol has 
proved coal resources of 217.4 billion tons, and its long-term 
reserves may exceed 1.2 trillion tons. In both these respects, 
it is second in the country. It has 15 coal fields with reserves 
of more than 5 billion tons; the Ordos coal field has coal 
reserves equivalent to 10 percent of the national total and is 
the largest of the world's seven major coal fields. Nei Monggol 
has abundant water resources: the Yellow River, the Ergun River, 
Daihai Lake and Huangqihai Lake are all within its boundaries. 
The Yellow River flows through the large Wuhai, Dongsheng, and 
Junggar coal fields. There are 17 locations that are suitable 
for the construction of power plants with capacities of 1 
million kW or more, with a total potential capacity of 35.47 
million kW. Nei Monggol's territory spans the "three northern" 
regions; it is near industrially developed regions that are 
relatively resource-poor, and electric power markets in such 
areas as Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, and 
Heilongjiang offer extensive prospects. 
  The question of whether to ship coal or transmit energy has 
been aggravated by the contradiction between rail transport and 
haulage capacity. But the problem is becoming better understood 
and views are maturing. In large-scale development of the 
electric power industry, the changeover to local resource 
conversion and from hauled coal to transmitted electricity will 
both decrease the pressure on the railroads and realize the 
objectives of a short construction cycle, low costs, and good 
benefits. 
  Party secretary of the autonomous region Wang Qun [3769 
5028] 
has repeatedly emphasized that "If the development of the energy 
industry can be done rapidly, it should not be done slowly, and 
if it can be done at a run it should not be done at a walk. We 
must make electric power lead the way, replace coal with 
electricity, have the coal industry stimulate the power 
industry, export more electric power outside the province, and 
convert resource advantages into economic advantages." As a 
result, the silent expanses of Mongolia have become the scene of 
bustling activity in the construction of an electric power base. 
  Between 1988 and 1992, the region expended a total of 3.389 
billion yuan to fund electric power construction. It installed 
1.5098 million kW of new generating capacity, representing an 
average increase of 30 percent a year. Its total installed 
generating capacity has reached 4.103 million kW, and it has 
built 793 km of 220-kV transmission lines. In the western zone, 
the framework of a superhigh-voltage grid running eastward from 
Wulashan to Datong has been built, and power lines have been 
connected to the North China power grid and have been put into 
operation. In five years, a total of 81.787 billion kWh of 
electricity has been produced, yielding a profits tax of more 
than 1.6 billion yuan. 
  Major electric power construction projects spread like 
wildfire, and "sun cities" sprang up across the land. In the 
course of five years, three 100,000-kW generating sets were 
added at Baotou, and the installed capacity at the Fengzhen 
power plant in the floodplain of the Yinma River reached 600,000 
kW. The construction of the first stage of the Junggar power 
plant, with two 100,000-kW generating sets, has been completed. 
Work on the expansion of facilities at Hohhot, Yuanbaoshan, 
Tongliao, and Huiliuhe and on new construction projects at 
Haibowan, Yimin, Huolinhe, Youzhong, and Dalad has been whipped 
up to a superhigh pace. Magnificent blueprints for 17 large 
power plants with capacities of 100,000 kW or more have been 
issued. 
  In the first six months of this year, Nei Monggol's electric 
power industry has experienced four gratifying events: a total 
output of 567.5 billion kWh and the transmission of 954 million 
kWh of electricity to North China, representing increases of 
13.8 and 17.04 percent respectively over last year; payment of 
255 million yuan in profits taxes, up 14.14 percent from the 
previous year; 80-percent implementation of 2.5 billion yuan in 
investment funds; and the signing of 13 equipment delivery 
contracts, representing a total of 4.6 million kW of capacity. 
<H3>  Benefitting From Policies, and Using Others' Funds for Power 
Production </H3>
  Under a planned economy, the electric power industry 
receives 
centralized state investments for construction, prices are 
specified centrally by the state, and output, distribution and 
sales are controlled by government departments. As a result, 
very large investments are inherently unmanageable, the prices 
charged for electricity do not reflect production costs, the 
enterprises take on increasing debt, and investment capabilities 
are, in essence, lost. Nei Monggol's economic strength was 
limited, and even in the best years, the local financial 
departments could only squeeze out 30 or 40 million yuan in 
funds for electric power. 
  In 1988, the leadership of the Nei Monggol Electric Power 
Management Office signed an eight-year funding and production 
agreement with the government of the autonomous region. This 
broke the stereotype of having exclusive government control of 
power production and began a new practice of independent 
operations, "having those who pay the money produce the power 
and receive the benefits," with unified creditor's rights. The 
contract specified that the profits paid annually to the finance 
organs would be entirely returned in the form of investments in 
electric power construction; it instituted new prices for new 
power generating facilities and new heat supply facilities; and 
those who used external funding for power production were not 
only to receive favorable consideration in state policies, but 
in addition would be given special consideration in taxation, 
land use, and the like. When this policy was announced, 
investors appeared in droves. In the last several years, they 
have established reliable investment partnership ties with a 
multitude of domestic financial groups and enterprises, as well 
as more than 10 countries and regions. 
  The leadership of the Nei Monggol Electric Power Management 
Office further liberated its thinking by expanding funding 
channels. Cause for encouragement is the fact that this April, 
leaders from Beijing City and the Ministry of Electric Power 
personally visited Nei Monggol to discuss arrangements for the 
provision of electricity to the capital. For many years Beijing 
has been short of electric power, and power cutoffs and cutbacks 
are a frequent occurrence. This fact not only imposed serious 
constraints on Beijing's economic development and caused great 
inconvenience to the masses, but was also inconsistent with 
Beijing's status as the capital. On 23 April, the three parties 
signed a joint power generation agreement, whose first stage is 
about to begin. According to the agreement, by 1995 Beijing will 
have made contributions totaling 1.55 billion yuan, the 
installed generating capacity in Nei Monggol's western power 
grid will have increased from 1.835 million kW to 4 million kW, 
and the amount of electricity that it supplies to Beijing will 
have increased from 1.1 to 1.5 million kW, so that Beijing will 
no longer experience power shutoffs. The second stage will begin 
in 1996, and by the end of the Ninth 5-Year Plan, the installed 
capacity of Nei Monggol's western power grid will reach 12 
million kW, enabling it to supply 5 million kW of electricity 
per year to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region. 
<H5>  Will Electric Power Become the West's "Radiant Center"? </H5>
  China's electric power industry bears a heavy burden and has 
a long road to travel. This year, the Nei Monggol Autonomous 
Region party committee repeatedly emphasized the guiding ideas 
in accelerating power industry development. The Nei Monggol 
Electric Power Management Office drafted objectives and measures 
for the period through the end of the century in order to make 
electric power construction the "radiant center" that will bring 
prosperity to the western region. 
  -- Make reform increasingly thorough, transform the 
mechanism, move toward markets, strengthen management, stabilize 
existing power generating facilities, implement capital 
construction investments of 1.83 billion yuan, commission 
374,000 kW of generating capacity, and carry on effective 
preparatory work for new power plant construction. 
  -- Make thorough use of advantages in resources, location, 
and policy, develop funding channels, attract large amounts of 
domestic and foreign construction investment. 
  -- Jointly with large domestic power production groups, use 
such flexible and diverse forms as equipment investment 
partnerships to obtain domestically produced equipment. 
Concurrently, appoint experts to be responsible for obtaining 
equipment from the west and from Russia. Implement mutual 
guarantees for coal supply, power production, and transport, 
unite with organizations that use electricity to produce steel 
and aluminum, and assure that materials are delivered on time. 
  The objectives are as follows: add 4.5 million kW of new 
generating capacity in the region by the end of the Eighth 
5-Year Plan, with the total installed capacity reaching 8.25 
million kW, and deliver 1.5 million kW of electricity to North 
China and 2.3 million kW to Northeast China; by the year 2000, 
bring the total installed generating capacity in the region to 
21.369 million kW and deliver 5 million kW to North China and 
6.5 million kW to Northeast China. 
  A Japanese economist exclaimed in amazement that China is 
implementing a "concentric circle" strategy in its energy 
economy. As he expressed it, the Ordos is the inner circle, 
which will be the first to produce an effect and also the pivot 
which will receive the benefits first. The second circle, which 
radiates outward for 200 km, will constitute Nei Monggol's 
central economic region. Finally, using the world's most 
advanced technology, electric power will be transmitted outward 
over a radius of 1000 km. These radiating circles will thus 
encompass the central region, representing a third of China's 
area. Thus the radiating segments of circles or "gradient 
circles" produced by the relatively developed coastal regions 
will advance circle by circle into the interior, and the 
resource-rich great northwestern region will radiate its 
powerful electricity outwards in expanding circles. Ultimately, 
when the two sets of radiating circles coalesce into a network, 
the differences between northern and southern China and between 
eastern and western China will shrink rapidly.

Jingruo [2612 4552 5387]] 
  [Text] On 15 December 1991, the Qinshan nuclear power 
plant sent a surge of power into the East China grid; and the 
commercial operations of the No. 1 unit of the Guangdong Daya 
nuclear power plant also began at the close of this year, and it 
will be delivering power to Guangdong and Hong Kong well into 
the future. 
  As China welcomes the arrival of nuclear power, this energy 
source is already supplying one-sixth of all of the electricity 
used in the world. In 1992, 424 nuclear power reactors were 
operating in various countries throughout the world. 
<H3>  1. Nuclear Power: The Key to Solving the Problems of 
Development </H3>
  In the 1960s and 1970s, as China was shipping its northern 
coal resources to the south, nuclear power was growing sharply 
in Europe and America. In over 30 years, the U.S. built more 
than 100 nuclear power reactors and became the leading nuclear 
power country in the world. France made it a national policy to 
solve its energy shortage by developing nuclear power, and in 
only 17 years, since 1973, the ratio of nuclear power rose from 
4 percent to 72 percent, and cheap reliable nuclear power has 
become the pillar of the French economy. Today, one-third of all 
of the electric power used in the energy-poor countries of the 
European Economic Community comes from nuclear power. In short, 
the fact is that the developed countries of Europe and America 
know there can be no entry into the 21st century without nuclear 
power. 
  In the 1980s, the center of world economic growth moved to 
the Asian-Pacific area and the nations of the Pacific rim, and 
the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island in the U.S. and at 
Chernobyl in the Soviet Union cast a cloud over the idea that 
nuclear power was the key to economic development. 
  Nuclear technology forces in Europe, America, and Japan are 
collaborating in applied research on a new reactor that is 
safer, cleaner, more economical, and consumes nuclear materials 
more completely -- the fast breeder reactor. Advanced nations 
have increased their research on nuclear fusion which could 
provide mankind with an inexhaustible supply of energy. 
  There can be no doubt that nuclear energy will be an 
important source of energy in the 21st century. Countries that 
do not gain access to nuclear energy will not join the ranks of 
advanced countries in the future world. 
<H3>  2. Nuclear Power: The Antigen for Prevention of Economic 
Difficulties on the Southeast Coast </H3>
  The energy shortage has become the "bottleneck" to China's 
economic development. The energy pinch is most strongly felt 
along the southeast coast, which is also feeling the effects of 
transportation pressures and environmental pollution, and the 
dislocated energy structure is the root cause of it all. 
  China's coal resources are mainly concentrated in Shanxi, 
Shaanxi, and western Inner Mongolia, 70 percent of the 
hydropower resources are in the southwest, and 80 percent of the 
electricity in the southeast is produced from coal. Northern 
coal is shipped south and western coal is shipped east. Coal for 
electric power accounts for 46 percent of the freight shipped on 
the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Guangdong rail lines, 30 
percent of the freight on the Huangjin waterway, and 26 percent 
of the freight on the highways. And that still does not satisfy 
the demand. In Jiangsu Province, there have been shutdowns of 
over 40 percent of the power generators because coal supplies 
were used up. 
  While coal provides the power for economic development, it 
also is the cause of transportation and environmental problems. 
One 1,000MW thermal power plant discharges tens of thousands of 
tons of harmful gases containing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
oxides into the atmosphere every year, and more than 100 
kilograms of such carcinogens as mercury and cadmium. 
  How then to extricate the southeast coastal economic zones 
from the grip of energy, transportation and environmental 
problems? If, as with a single surgical stroke to cure three 
ailments, there were a single energy resource, which with a 
singular investment could heal all afflictions, wouldn't that be 
more ideal? Let those who would send hydropower over extreme 
distances behold the light of nuclear power. 
  It is easy to see the advantages of nuclear power over coal 
power. A 1,000 MW pressurized-water reactor needs only 30 tons 
of fuel a year, which is 1 one-hundred-thousandth that of a 
thermal power plant of the same scale. Pollution from a safely 
operated nuclear power plant is negligible, its radiation 
discharge being less than a coal power plant of the same scale. 
  In 1970, having heard reports on the situation in Shanghai, 
Premier Zhou Enlai said that the solution to Shanghai's energy 
shortage is nuclear power. Nuclear power has been the antidote 
for many energy deficient places in the world that have 
concentrated populations and rapid industrial growth, and there 
is little doubt it will be good medicine for the southeast 
coastal areas. 
<H5>  3. Nuclear Power: Not Easy for China </H5>
  Although the advantages of nuclear power are obvious; 
  Although China has plenty of uranium to support nuclear 
power; 
  Although through the process of developing nuclear weapons, 
the uranium mining industry grew well, uranium isotopes were 
separated, nuclear fuel elements were produced as planned, 
reactors were built and spent fuel was processed, all of which 
rounds out a complete nuclear industry system; 
  Although China has a force of nuclear industry specialists 
tens of thousands strong with decades of hard experience and 
training; 
  Although China's basic industries are well developed and can 
meet the requirements for developing nuclear power; 
  Nuclear power is, nonetheless, in an infantile stage in 
China. 
  By the end of September, the Qinshan nuclear power plant had 
generated a total of 1.7 billion kWh of electric power. Adding 
the power generated by the two 900MW units of the Daya Bay 
plant, as of late 1993 and mid-1994, nuclear power provides only 
1 percent of the total output of electricity in China. 
  China was late on the scene, and missed out on the biggest 
opportunity for development. On 28 February 1990, Qian Sanqiang, 
Li Jue, Jiang Shengjie, and Wang Ganchang submitted a statement 
to Jiang Zemin and Li Peng calling for the early establishment 
of mid- and long-term plans for China's nuclear power 
development, and expressed the sincere concern and interests 
that the four distinguished elder scientists and leaders have 
for their country and their people. On 30 April, Premier Li Peng 
responded to them by letter saying, "On 15 March the State 
Council Nuclear Power Leadership Group Plenary Session 
determined that nuclear power would be included in the National 
Economic Plan." 
  The coastal provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, 
Shandong, 
Liaoning, and Hainan, and the inland provinces of Sichuan, 
Jiangsu, and Hunan have all expressed their desire to build 
nuclear power stations, and the strategic goal for the country 
today is to speed up development, and get into the race. In 
August 1993, the China National Nuclear Industry Corporation 
assembled the talent and facilities in its nuclear engineering, 
design, prospecting, construction, facilities acquisition and 
technical services fields to form the China International 
Nuclear Engineering Group Enterprise, to gain some ground in 
opening up a nuclear power market. 
  There are, however, some obstacles to moving forward just 
yet 
because the role of nuclear power in China's economic 
development is not fully recognized by the policy makers, there 
is no unified leadership among national nuclear power 
departments, and the lack of guaranteed funding sources is a 
hindrance to scientific research and construction. 
  Nuclear power construction requires early investment and its 
success depends heavily on safety and financial guarantees. The 
two other nuclear power plants now tabled for construction are 
the Guangdong and Bohai Bay plant in Liaoning are thoroughly 
planned from the safety standpoint, but whether firm funding 
will be assured is another matter. 
  The development of nuclear power is a complex system of 
engineering because of its particular requirements for 
end-to-end facilities research and production, supplying nuclear 
fuel, processing depleted fuels, processing the "three wastes," 
and the selection and release of power plant sites; and the 
engineering process demands a high degree of unified leadership 
and decisive action. Without it, the application of nuclear 
power to the economic bottleneck will not realize its maximum 
advantage, and only that will fulfill the dreams of the nuclear 
workforce, slake the country's thirst for electric power, and 
brighten the hearts of the people. China needs the light and 
heat of nuclear power to break the bottleneck.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Qin Jingwu [4440 0079 0582]] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese electric power industry completed its 
annual mission for the installation of new power capacity nine 
days ahead of schedule, and kept the annual capacity of newly 
installed large- and medium-sized units above 12,000 MW for the 
sixth straight year, maintaining the fastest pace of electric 
power development in the world. 
  The total national power output for the year was 815 billion 
kWh, 9.44 percent over last year, of which 671 billion kWh was 
from thermal power, an increase of 9.16 percent, and hydropower 
was 144 billion kWh, a 10.77 percent increase over last year. 
The entire electric power industry earned 19.9 billion yuan in 
profit taxes, an increase of 15.4 percent over the previous year. 
  Although China's power industry has grown rapidly, the 
national economy has grown even faster and the power supply is 
more than 20 percent short of needs. In order to put electric 
power ahead of the curve, the Ministry of Electric Power is 
planning to add 15,000 MW of new units annually from 1995 to 
1997, and 20,000 MW annually from 1998 to 2000, which will be an 
increase of about 300,000 MW of installed capacity by the end of 
the century, and will basically meet China's domestic needs. The 
government will make a great effort to raise the money for this, 
and will encourage joint efforts among administrative areas to 
get electric power and develop hydropower resources, and will 
encourage coastal economic development zones to make even 
greater investments into energy bases to get power, and for 
sending power out of energy rich areas; Economically developed 
areas will be encouraged to raise funds for power, and power 
enterprises will be allowed to go directly to the banks and 
other financial institutions for loans, or to issue bonds and 
shares.

<F P=106> [Article by Guo Changxi [6753 2490 3588], Zheng Xian [6774 </F>
2009], and Zhou Zhenbang [0719 2182 6721]: ``Caohejing 
Development Zone Taking Shape''] 
  [Summary] Shanghai, 14 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO wire report) -- 
The Shanghai Caohejing New-Technologies Development Zone over 
its five-year-plus history has become an export-oriented, 
multifunctional new high-tech industrial park that has attracted 
investment and related plant construction by a number of 
internationally known high-tech corporations. Aggregate gross 
investment for the 115 foreign-funded enterprises in the zone 
has reached US$600 million, while foreign capital attracted is 
at $360 million, of which there are 15 projects (about 14 
percent of the 115) funded with at least $10 million each. 
  Within the Caohejing Zone, Shanghai Beiling Microelectronics 
Mfrg. Ltd., Shanghai Microelectronics Engineering Research 
Center, and Shanghai Philips Semiconductor Corp. have formed a 
technologically advanced microelectronics industry mini-zone 
integrating research, development, intermediate testing, 
production, and sales. This mini-zone has an industrial-grade, 
communications-grade, and consumer-grade large-scale integrated 
circuit (LSI) production capacity outfitted with 0.65-micron IC 
design technology, technology for producing 4-5-inch silicon 
wafers, and technology for fabricating l.2-3-micron ICs. A 
Shanghai fiber optic communications industrial base has taken 
shape around the Shanghai Fiber Optic Communications Engineering 
Co., Shanghai AT&amp;T Communications Equipment Ltd., and the 
Sino-U.S. joint venture AT&amp;T Fiber Optic Communications Ltd. 
Some 30 firms, including Shanghai Foxboro Co. and Shanghai 
Qiming [0796 2494] Software Ltd., have formed a computer 
software industrial group engaged in R&amp;D of products for 
industrial and office automation, information and enterprise 
management, finance, insurance, and commerce. The wholly 
U.S.-owned 3M China Ltd., the Sino-U.S. joint venture Shanghai 
Ruikan [3843 0170] (Electric) Cable Accessories Ltd., and the 
British firm ICI Co. have formed an 
international-state-of-the-art production base for industrial 
new materials. Finally, Caohejing has the nation's first 
bioengineering R&amp;D/intermediate-testing base--the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences' (CAS) Shanghai Bioengineering Research 
Center and other Sino-foreign joint ventures have formed an 
embryonic bioengineering industrial development zone. 
  As of the end of 1993, the Caohejing Zone's industrial gross 
output value exceeded 4.2 billion yuan, business sales income 
exceeded 5.5 billion yuan, industrial profits approached 700 
million yuan, annual per capita sales income for foreign-funded 
enterprises within the development zone reached 330,000 yuan, 
and annual per capita profit was 70,000 yuan.

Electronics''] 
  [Text] China's exports--and imports--of electronics rose 
sharply last year. 
  According to statistics from the General Administration of 
Customs, exports of electronic products amounted to $8.1 billion 
in 1993, up 18.1 percent over 1992. 
  Imports, meanwhile, jumped 32 percent to $10.6 billion. 
  Imports of visual and audio merchandise and 
telecommunications products hit $5.53 billion, while exports 
totalled $5.01 billion. 
  About $3.62 billion of electronic components and instruments 
were imported and $1.51 billion worth were exported. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises are playing a bigger role in the 
exports, said a senior official from the Ministry of Electronics 
Industry. 
  Last year foreign-funded enterprises accounted for more than 
40 percent of all exports. The proportion will continue to grow 
in the coming years, the official said. 
  Exports of consumer electronics kept rising last year. China 
exported 113 million cassette tape recorders worth $150 million 
and 11.31 million television sets of which 6.95 million were 
black and white. 
  China's exports of cassette tape recorders and 
black-and-white TV sets rank first in the world. 
  The official said China is trying to increase exports of 
electronic products for investment use and basic electronic 
components. 
  For example, China exported $558 million worth of computers 
and related products last year, an increase of 85 percent over 
1992. 
  Last year's 18.1 percent growth in electronic exports 
actually was a slowdown from 1992, when they jumped by more than 
40 percent over 1991. 
  The ministry official attributed the slower expansion to the 
brisk domestic market and exporters' shortage of capital. 
  According to the ministry's statistics for 1993, Chinese 
electronic production reached 139.8 billion yuan ($16 billion), 
an increase of 26.4 percent over 1992. Sales jumped by 37.6 
percent to 113.27 billion yuan ($13 billion). 
  The official said China now mainly exports low-grade 
products, which yield low profits. 
  He noted that while exports of TV sets increased by 20 
percent last year, their value rose by only 5 percent. 
  At present, China depends on Hong Kong and Macao to absorb 
its exports, but the official said other markets will be 
explored. 
  Although the imbalance in the trading of electronics 
accounted for nearly 20 percent of China's entire trade deficit 
last year, the ministry official said imports will probably 
continue growing rapidly this year. 
  This expanding market for electronics has drawn the 
attention 
of many foreign companies, which are eager to supply the 
up-to-date equipment China needs to modernize itself. For 
instance, the country plans to set up nationwide economic 
information networks that will need sophisticated technology 
from abroad. 
  Last year, many big names in the international industry sent 
high-profile delegations to China seeking business. 
  More are expected this year. Lou Gerstner, chairman of IBM 
Corp., the world's largest computer maker, and William H. Gates 
III, chairman of Microsoft Corp., the software giant, are 
scheduled to make their first visits to China separately in 
March.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Weili [0491 5898 7787]: ``Ministry of </F>
Electronics Industry Organizes Expert Forum for Electronics 
Industry Development Planning''] 
  [Text] From 19 to 20 October 1993, the General Planning 
Department and the Technology and Quality Monitoring Department 
of the Ministry of Electronics Industry (MEI) held a joint 
expert forum in Beijing for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (FYP) and 
for 2010 planning. The forum was attended by experts and 
supervisors from more than 40 units in the ministerial system. 
MEI Deputy Minister Zhang Jinqiang [1728 0093 1730] gave an 
important speech at the forum. Also present were Director Wu 
Xiaolong [0702 1420 7893] and Deputy Directors Xu Shuncheng 
[1776 7311 2052] and Wang Jianzhang [3769 1696 4545] of the 
General Planning Department, Director Li Houbin [2621 0624 7001] 
of the Technology and Quality Monitoring Department, Director Li 
Dasheng [6786 1129 0581] of the Basic Product and Major Projects 
Department, and Deputy Director Chen Zhengqing [7115 2973 3237] 
of the Computer and Information Promotion Department. 
  Zhang Jinqiang analyzed in his speech recent achievements 
and 
existing problems of China's electronics industry. He emphasized 
conceptual planning for the Ninth FYP and 2010. He pointed out 
that plans for the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth FYPs were all 
formulated under a planned economics system and carried a heavy 
planned-economy flavor. While planning for the Ninth FYP, we are 
faced with a very different setting. First, as the socialist 
market economy matures, the market is playing an increasingly 
stronger role in the allocation of resources. Second, when China 
joins GATT, the domestic market and the foreign market will 
merge to form a greater market. With these premises, we must be 
innovative conceptually and practically in our planning for the 
Ninth FYP. We must on the one hand learn from the previous FYPs 
and on the other hand seize the opportunity of the new reform 
situation in China and adjustment of the international 
electronics industrial structure. We should formulate a plan for 
the greater industry and the greater market. The plan should be 
authoritative and of a guiding nature. He stressed the following 
five major points: 
  (1) Strengthen macroscopic control and practice 
industry-wide 
management. The plan should be beyond departments and ownership. 
It should be an industry-wide plan for state-owned, 
collectively-owned, private, and foreign businesses. 
  (2) Implement the new ``16-word'' development strategy. 
  (3) Make fundamental changes in ideology, both in job 
function and in development approach. 
  (4) Lead the development with systems engineering and 
network 
engineering. Here he described in detail 20 major projects in 
the ministry. 
  (5) Pay attention to key products, key enterprises, and key 
regions. 
  Li Houbing described the main functions of the Technology 
and 
Quality Monitoring Department and progress in technical 
planning. He also analyzed the relationship between industrial 
planning and technology planning and the importance of 
technology to the advance of the electronics industry. Wu 
Xiaolong expressed three opinions. First, the main point of 
planning is no longer how to divide the money and materials. 
With limited financial resources, the state resources must 
reside on major engineering projects. Second, we must properly 
handle the relationship between domestic and foreign issues and 
make full use of the ``two resources, two markets.'' Joining 
GATT will place Chinese products on equal footing in competing 
with foreign products. We must therefore aim high and pay 
attention to economic efficiency. Third, we should avoid 
repetition. 
  The attending experts listened to the presentations of 
Zhang, 
Li and Wu and conducted wide-ranging discussions on 
communications, television broadcasting, computers and software, 
microelectronics, basic products and military applications. They 
made the following recommendations for the Ninth FYP and 2010: 
<H5>  I. Methods for Speeding Up Development </H5>
  (1) New Understanding of the ``16-Word'' Strategy 
  We must first adhere to ``market orientation'' and organize 
our production and macroscopic control according to the market 
supply and demand. We must change the old practice of paying 
attention only to production and ignoring management, and 
centering all activities on the plan and not the market. In the 
meantime, we must use efficient industrial management to promote 
consumption and direct the market. Second, we should combine the 
strategy of ``using the foreign market to stimulate the domestic 
market'' and the development model of ``using offense as a 
defense.'' We need to carry forward the development of some 
basic industries in China by exporting. For example, we can 
proceed to produce HDTV receivers that meet U.S. standards for 
the U.S. market and by so doing develop domestic HDTV receivers 
and related industries in China. 
  (2) Strengthening Industrial Management and Information 
Guidance 
  We should avoid duplication, improve industrial management, 
and include all enterprises, including village and city 
enterprises and ``tri-investment'' enterprises into the 
management system. To enhance management, MEI should implement 
several constraint and control measures. Examples are the right 
to formulate product and technical standards, and to certify 
equipment. They recommended a reform of the State Radio 
Regulatory Committee so that it may transcend other departments 
and become more efficient. 
  (3) Establishing China's Own Industry 
  The strength of the industry is in its products. There can 
be 
development only when the products meet the needs of the 
customers. We should make the development of the ``Golden Card'' 
a major business in China. If MEI itself is buying the ``Golden 
Card'' from foreign countries, then the banks can also buy it 
and there would be no need for MEI to develop it. China was 
practicing importing during the Sixth and Seventh FYPs and 
cooperation during the Eighth FYP; now it is time to establish 
our own industry and stop relying on others. 
  (4) People as the Key to Development 
  Much more attention should be given to people and stability 
of the ranks. In recent years people in enterprise units are 
flowing toward joint-venture and independently owned businesses, 
offices of foreign businesses in China, and toward the eastern 
coastal areas. This human flow has left many business units with 
technical staffs trained in the 1950s and 1960s. There is now an 
alarming discontinuity in human resources, which is extremely 
detrimental to the development of the electronics industry. The 
forum recommends that MEI perfect its reward system, formulate 
corresponding policies, and stabilize ranks. This has a direct 
impact on the realization of goals set for the Ninth FYP and 
2010. 
  (5) Reconciling Research and Production 
  Speed up the reform of the old scientific research system, 
establish national high-tech venture capital foundations, let 
the state share the risks and benefits with the enterprises and 
the research institutes. Pay attention to basic research and 
technology reserves, provide protection via investment policy. 
<H5>  II. Development Trends for Ninth FYP and 2010 </H5>
  (1) Communications and Television 
  The trends in communications and television are digital 
technology, multi-media, software, and system networking. In the 
short term, analog mobile communications products will still be 
the lead product in the Chinese market, and we must quickly 
master the technology for mass production. For digital mobile 
communications products we need to excel in research and follow 
this technology. Fiber-optic communications will be centered on 
the development of synchronous fiber-optic technology. The main 
task in microwave communications is to improve the volume, 
quality, and reliability. Satellite communications will again be 
based on digitized transmission. Developments in television will 
include a CATV system based on fiber-optic transmission. Digital 
TV will be gradually commercialized and China needs to conduct 
research and technology tracking for [digital] HDTV. 
  (2) Computers and Software 
  The unification of computers and communication characterizes 
an information society. Parallel processing is an important way 
to improve computing and will be the trend for future mid-size 
and main-frame computers. Software and information services are 
capturing a greater share in the computer industry. The triad of 
software, systems integration, and services is the main trend in 
software development. Multi-media will become practical. 
Magnetic recording will move toward greater volume and density 
and magneto-optical disks will find broad application in 
computers. Computer security will receive increasing attention. 
Software operating systems will be based on Unix and Windows. 
Software development should move toward public-domain 
applications and development tools should move from single to 
integrated. Development methods will go from the traditional 
methods toward object-oriented approaches. 
  The Ninth FYP should emphasize notebook computers. China has 
already made some progress in workstations and the efforts 
should continue. The software industry should stress application 
software, especially high-level software packages. The 
technology for software tools and systems software should be 
tracked. 
  (3) Microelectronics 
  The future development trends in microelectronics are 
integrable, programmable FPGA [field-programmable gate array] 
technology, MOSYS systems, hybrid ICs, and quantum devices. 
Development emphasis for the Ninth FYP should be placed on the 
following items: When introducing new technology for the 
low-grade or medium-grade products already on the market, the 
emphasis should be on the novelty and not on the high tech. 
Practice secondary integration using existing foreign technology 
and products. Strive for breakthroughs in the design of ICs. Pay 
attention to packaging and broaden the applications of 
microelectronics in the automobile industry. 
  (4) Basic Products 
  Production of components will continue to move toward 
miniaturization, thin-film usage, and large-scale integration. 
Mass-production technology will receive great attention. 
Emphasis in the Ninth FYP should be as follows: In component 
production, chip-type components are yielding the mid-grade 
market in favor of low-grade, high-consumption components and 
high-grade products with high added value. The development of 
sensors and transducers should stress silicon-on-sapphire [SOS] 
transducers with high stability in a high humidity environment, 
low-voltage pressure-sensitive resistors, and thin-film Hall 
devices. The emphasis in electronic components should be hybrid 
ICs, electronic power meters, electronic cards, and heat 
sensors. Electronic functional materials should stress sensing 
materials, precision electronics ceramics, high-density and 
low-noise magnetic recording materials, fiber-optic materials, 
high-energy-density rare earth permanent magnetic materials, and 
new types of acousto-optic materials. For relays and connectors, 
China should first develop relays and connectors used in 
communications and television, solid-state relays and chip 
connectors, ICs, and multi-layer printed circuit boards. Second, 
China should mass-produce black-and-white and color TFTs 
[thin-film transistor LCDs] and monochrome and black-and-white 
STN [supertwist-nematic LCDs] used in opto-electronics. Third, 
in the area of electronic equipment and special facilities, 
China should emphasize communications equipment and equipment 
for precision manufacturing. 
  (5) Military Electronics 
  Modern war has placed a higher demand on electronics 
technology. Experts at the forum made forecasts for the needs in 
China's command systems, navigation guidance systems, 
friend-or-foe identification systems, information systems, 
aerospace systems, and traffic control systems, and identified 
the key technologies for each system.

SAR Digital Imaging''; MS received Feb 92, revised Nov 92] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  In this paper, a method of high-resolution digital imaging 
using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is presented. 
Computer digital images are generated using raw radar data 
collected by the U.S. ocean surveillance satellite SEASAT-A. The 
images cover 2,048 cells in the range direction and two 
synthetic apertures in the azimuth direction with an imaging 
area of approximately 38 km x 34 km. The high-quality radar 
images with a resolution of 25 m x 25 m have demonstrated the 
effectiveness of the proposed method. 
<H5>  I. Introduction </H5>
  During the past 20 years, the use of synthetic aperture 
radar 
(SAR) as an advanced microwave remote sensor has attracted a 
great deal of attention. Since the mid-1970s, SAR technology has 
evolved from airborne applications to spaceborne applications. 
In recent years, significant progress has been made in 
spaceborne SAR technology. Since the launch of the SEASAT-A 
satellite by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration in 1978, the U.S. SIR-A, SIR-B, SIR-C, and 
European ERS-1, the Canadian RADAR SAT and the Japanese JERS-1 
satellites have all been equipped with advanced SAR imaging 
systems. 
  The unique features of spaceborne SAR systems are: high 
altitude, extended range and coverage, wide bandwidth, and high 
data rate; also, various error correction and compensation 
schemes and complex signal processing techniques are used in 
spaceborne SAR. There are distinct differences between 
spaceborne SAR and airborne SAR. Because of the relatively low 
altitude and slow velocity of airborne SAR, the Earth can be 
regarded as a large planar surface, which makes signal 
processing relatively easy. In the case of spaceborne SAR, 
however, the effects of Earth rotation and Earth curvature 
produce coupling in the radar returns between the range 
direction and the azimuth direction; as a result, azimuth 
compression of the radar signal becomes very complicated. In 
general, digital image processing for spaceborne SAR involves 
range processing, azimuth processing, motion compensation and 
multi-look processing, of which the most difficult problems are 
azimuth processing and motion compensation. In this paper, a 
method of digital imaging using spaceborne SAR is presented. The 
effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the 
high-resolution images generated using raw radar data collected 
by the U.S. SEASAT-A satellite. 
<H5>  II. Mathematical Model of the Radar Signal </H5>
  The radar transmits a linear frequency-modulated (FM) pulse 
signal. Let _D_ be the pulse width, T be the pulse repetition 
period, R(t) be the slant range between the satellite and the 
ground target, W[.sup]a[/](t) be the azimuth directivity 
function of the antenna, _s_(x,r) be the scattering coefficient 
of the ground target, a(t) be a step function of width _D_, 
_l_ 
be the wavelength, and c be the speed of light; then the radar 
return signal can be expressed as:[.sup]1[/] 
  s(x,r) = _s_(x,r)W[.sup]r[/](r) * h[.sub]1[/](x,r) 
*[.sup]r[/]h[.sub]2[/](x,r) (1) 
  where W[.sup]r[/](r) is the range directivity function of 
the antenna, * is the two-dimensional convolution with respect 
to azimuth x and range r; *[.sup]r[/] is the one-dimensional 
convolution with respect to range r. Also, 

  In the above equation, f[.sup]D[/] is the Doppler center 
frequency, f[.sup]R[/] is the rate of change of Doppler 
frequency, v is the satellite velocity relative to the ground, 
and b is the frequency-modulation rate. 
  One can see from the radar signal model that the radar 
return 
is a complicated two-dimensional convolution; the purpose of 
signal processing is to extract the scattering characteristics 
of the target from the received signal, and ultimately to form a 
high-quality radar image. 
<H5>  III. Range-Compression Processing </H5>
  Range processing of spaceborne SAR actually implies pulse 
compression. Digital pulse compression in the range direction 
uses FFT for matched filter implementation. The processed signal 
can be expressed as: 

  where c[.sup]0[/] = 2b_D_/c. 
  It is known from the principle of pulse compression that the 
slant range resolution after pulse compression is: 
  _r_[.sup]r[/] = c/2B[.sub]r[/] 
  and the ground range resolution is: 


  where B[.sup]r[/] is the signal bandwidth, H is the 
satellite altitude, R[.sup]e[/] is the mean Earth radius, and 
_th_ is the antenna viewing angle. The number of samples of the 
range reference function is 


  where f[.sup]s[/] is the sampling frequency. 
  The raw data collected by SEASAT-A are digital data produced 
by the A/D converter; prior to range processing, they must first 
be orthogonalized and then matched-filtered. The 
orthogonalization process is accomplished in the frequency 
domain, where a window function is applied and the signal 
carrier frequency is shifted to zero frequency; finally, a 
complex IFFT [inverse fast Fourier transform] is performed to 
complete the process of range digital pulse compression. This 
process is equivalent to a transformation from real data to 
complex data; the complex data are stored for azimuth processing. 
<H5>  IV. Azimuth-Compression Processing </H5>
  The azimuth reference function is chosen based on the 
expression of the range-compressed radar signal:[.sup]2[/] 


  Due to the effect of range drift, coupling between the range 
direction and the azimuth direction exists in the radar return; 
therefore, azimuth processing requires complicated 
two-dimensional processing. In fact, azimuth processing is 
actually a two-dimensional matched filtering; the filtered 
output signal represents the scattering characteristics of the 
ground target, which is of the form: 
  _s_[.sup]0[/](x,r) = s[.sub]R[/](x,r) * 
h[.sup]*[/][.sup]a[/](x,r) (8) 
  The implementation of two-dimensional matched filtering for 
azimuth processing is highly computation-intensive. By using a 
hybrid time-domain and frequency-domain correlation technique, 
the two-dimensional problem reduces to a one-dimensional 
problem, and the correction of range drift can be accomplished 
in the frequency domain; as a result, the amount of computation 
is greatly reduced. For a second-order curve R(x), the azimuth 
reference function for range r[.sup]0[/] is: 


  where d[.sup]i[/] is the distance of the range reference 
value r[.sup]0[/], and 


  The expression in the frequency domain after azimuth 
processing is of the form: 


  It can be seen from the above expression that the hybrid 
correlation method uses time-domain correlation in the range 
direction and frequency-domain correlation in the azimuth 
direction; this approach takes full advantage of the FFT and 
therefore provides an efficient way of calculating precision 
impulse response. 
  If the above method is applied directly for azimuth 
compression, the amount of computation will increase with 
increasing Doppler center frequency. A more efficient way would 
be to apply correction to the range wander (the linear term of 
range drift) before azimuth pulse compression, then apply 
correction to the range bending (the second-order term of range 
drift) in the frequency domain; this approach requires less 
computation, and R(x) in the azimuth reference function 
g[.sup]i[/](x,r[.sub]0[/]) becomes: 


  Computer results show that the digital images of spaceborne 
SAR produced by this method and the previous method are almost 
identical, but the amount of computation for azimuth compression 
(at f[.sup]D[/] = 980 Hz) is reduced by one half. 
<H5>  V. Motion Compensation </H5>
  Because of antenna pointing error and errors caused by 
satellite motion, it is difficult to accurately estimate the 
Doppler center frequency and the rate of change of Doppler 
frequency from satellite historical data and from SAR 
parameters. Inaccuracy in the Doppler center frequency and in 
the rate of change of Doppler frequency will have an adverse 
effect on SAR images. Inaccuracy in the Doppler center frequency 
will result in lower signal-to-noise ratio, which in turn will 
cause an increase in the fuzziness in azimuth and a shift in the 
target position. Inaccuracy in the rate of change of Doppler 
frequency will cause defocusing in the radar images and result 
in a decrease in pixel resolution. An effective method of 
estimating the Doppler parameters is to estimate the errors in 
the Doppler parameters directly from the radar return data. 
  The clutter lock used for estimating the errors in the 
Doppler center frequency is obtained from the normalized energy 
difference of the symmetric multi-look sub-images.[.sup]3[/] 
Experimental results show that the error in the Doppler center 
frequency is proportional to the normalized energy difference 
_D_E: 
  _D_f[.sup]D[/]  f[.sub]R[/]T_D_E (13) 
  where T is the time required for the satellite to travel the 
distance of one aperture. 
  The auto-focusing used for estimating the rate of change of 
Doppler frequency is determined by the relationships between the 
multi-look sub-images. The offset between the first-look 
sub-image and the Nth-look sub-image _D_X can be obtained from 
the relationship between the two sub-images. Experimental 
results show that the offset is proportional to the errors in 
the rate of change of Doppler frequency: 
  _D_f[.sup]R[/]  f[.sub]R[/] _D_X/vT (14) 
  Accurate estimates of the Doppler center frequency and the 
rate of change of Doppler frequency can be obtained by an 
iterative procedure. For example, for an image around the city 
of London, the estimation error of the Doppler center frequency 
is less than 10 Hz, and the estimation error of the rate of 
change of Doppler frequency is less than 0.3 Hz/sec. 
<H5>  VI. Spaceborne SAR Digital Imaging </H5>
  Raw radar data of an area around the city of London have 
been 
collected by the U.S. SEASAT-A satellite; the center of the area 
is located at 51.43 N. latitude and 0.33 E. longitude. 
The radar parameters and signal processing parameters are as 
follows:

  The estimated Doppler center frequency and the rate of 
change 
of Doppler frequency are approximately 940 Hz and 505 Hz/s, and 
the range drift is 43 range resolution cells. In order to reduce 
the effect of spot noise during the formation of the radar 
signal, we use an iterative procedure of non-coherent 
integration of 4-look sub-images. Figure 1 [photo not 
reproduced] shows the computer-generated digital image obtained 
using the method given in this paper. The processed image has a 
resolution of 25 m x 25 m; the imaging area covers 2,048 range 
cells and two synthetic apertures in the azimuth direction, 
which corresponds to an area of approximately 38 km x 34 km. 
During the imaging process, Doppler parameters are estimated 
every 128 range cells. 
<H5>  VII. Conclusion </H5>
  By applying the spaceborne SAR digital imaging method 
presented in this paper, we have generated computer images using 
raw radar data collected by the U.S. SEASAT-A satellite. These 
are the first high-resolution spaceborne SAR images obtained in 
this country; the image resolution is 25 m x 25 m. The results 
of computer images have verified the effectiveness of the 
proposed method.

  [Text] Beijing (CSN) -- Construction of China's first high 
Reynolds number transonic two-dimensional wind tunnel at the 
Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has 
been completed; on 30 October, it was certified by the CAS. The 
14 members of the certification committee, which include 
renowned Chinese aerodynamicists, academic committee members, 
chief engineer of the China Aerospace Industrial Corp., Prof. 
Zhuan Fenggan, Prof. Dai Changhui, Prof. Lin Yunpei, and other 
experts believe that the high Reynolds number transonic wind 
tunnel developed by the Institute of Mechanics matches leading 
wind tunnels of the world in terms of technical standard and 
performance. 
  The key simulation parameters in an aerodynamic test are the 
flight Mach number and Reynolds number. A conventional transonic 
wind tunnel can usually simulate the proper Mach number, but the 
simulated Reynolds number is typically one or two orders of 
magnitude lower than actual flight values. Therefore, some of 
the aircraft designed in the 1960s based on data obtained from 
conventional transonic wind tunnels developed problems. In an 
effort to avoid these problems, the United States, Canada, 
Europe, and Japan have invested huge sums of money since the 
1970s to develop and construct high Reynolds number wind tunnels. 
  In the early 1980s, having developed an impulse type 
aerodynamic test facility and corresponding experimental 
techniques, experts of the Institute of Mechanics proposed the 
idea of building a high Reynolds number tubular wind tunnel; the 
initial design effort was led by Prof. Zhuan Fenggan. In 1988, 
the project was approved by the CAS. 
  With limited funds, members of the research and development 
group were determined to make this project a success. During the 
construction, they found innovative approaches that were 
compatible with China's limited industrial and economic 
resources, and succeeded in building the wind tunnel with a 
small investment and very short development cycle. The overall 
design has also built-in provisions for further improving the 
performance and expanding the utility of the wind tunnel. The 
success of this project has paved the way for future development 
of high Reynolds number transonic wind tunnels in China.

performance of ITO, IO and TO films are given. These films are 
prepared on substrates of flexible Kapton, Mylar and FEP Teflon

  [Text] Key words: Cuprous oxide, nanoscale particles, 
preparation, exciton limitation, optical characteristics. 
  Due to the quantum confinement effect, semiconducting 
nanoparticles produce a series of new phenomena,[.sup]1,2[/] 
among which the materials with ultra-fast optical nonlinear 
response have been particularly noticed. It is predicted that 
these semiconducting materials will be the basic optoelectronic 
materials of the future. The study of the opto-absorption and 
-relaxation properties of nanoscale crystals will help us 
further understand the mechanism of nonlinear optical response. 
  When the size of a semiconducting nanocrystal is as small as 
the Bohr radius a[.sup]B[/] of its own phase, a series of 
changes of electronic state and optical property can be 
observed. These phenomena are observed in the semiconducting 
nanocrystal systems of CdS, CuCl, CdSe, PbS.[.sup]3,4[/] The 
ratio of the nanocrystal radius R to its Bohr radius 
a[.sup]B[/] can be used as the general guideline to determine 
the influence of the quantum confinement effect on the 
electronic state:[.sup]5[/] When R/a[.sup]B[/] &lt;&lt; 1, the 
nanoparticles are in the strong quantum confinement zone, and 
their energy levels of electrons and holes are clearly 
separated; however, when R/a[.sup]B[/] &gt; &gt;  1, the 
nanocrystal is in the exciton confinement zone where the 
excitons act as quasi-particles whose translation kinetic 
energy's degree of freedom is confined within the 
three-dimensional space; as a result the exciton energy increase 
is limited. Currently, only CuCl nanocrystals are being 
researched as an exciton-confinement-zone material, and they are 
also good model materials for the study of excitonic molecule 
properties. This paper presents the preparation of cuprous oxide 
(Cu[.sup]2[/]O) nanocrystals and discussion of their optical 
properties, as well as a discussion of results based on the 
model of exciton responses to the quantum confinement effect. 
<H5>  1. Experiment </H5>
  The Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals are made by the 
oxidation-reduction method in a micro-emulsive liquid. The 
process flow diagram is as follows: 


  The Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals made by this method are all 
coated with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS) molecules, and 
form a transparent sol with toluene. The crystal sizes can vary 
within the limit of 5-10.0 nm as determined by the initial value 
of [CuAc[.sup]2[/]]/[DBS]. The transmission electron 
microscope and the low-angle X-ray scattering experiments show 
that the spread of the Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal dimensions 
is very narrow. About 93 percent of the crystal dimensions have 
the median radius, and the rest are distributed within the 10 
percent of the median radius. The radius distribution of the 
nanocrystals is thus well suited for the study of optical 
properties. 
  The room-temperature photoluminescence and excitation 
spectra 
of the Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal sol series are measured with 
a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrometer. 
<H5>  2. Results and Discussions </H5>
  The visible-ultraviolet absorption spectra of 
Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal (9.0 nm) organic sol starts at 650 
nm. The absorption rate gradually increases toward the 
high-frequency region, but there is no clear indication of 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-09D></FIG>

            structural absorption characteristics. This implies that the 
phenomenon is influenced by two factors: one is the temperature 
and solvent effects; and the other is the size effect. Because 
the dimensions of the nanocrystal are far greater than the Bohr 
radius a[.sup]B[/] (0.7 nm) of its own phase, the increase of 
the exciton energy is not obvious, and the energy separation 
induced by the confinement effect is very minor. 
  Figure 1 shows the photoluminescence spectra of the 
Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals. The excitation luminescences are 
(1) 330 nm, (2) 400 nm, (3) 440 nm, (4) 460 nm, (5) 510 nm, and 
(6) 532 nm. Five luminescence bands are visible in the 
neighborhood of 400 nm, 475 nm, 505 nm, 540 nm and 565 nm. The 
last four bands correspond to the existing four luminescence 
bands in the exciton systems, namely, indigo, blue, green, and 
yellow.[.sup]6[/] The energy changes in the exciton 
confinement zone are comparatively small. The luminescences are 
undoubtedly fluorescence resonance emissions. In addition, the 
luminescence at 400 nm indicates the presence of energy jumps 
between bands within the Cu[.sup]2[/]O crystal. The emission 
luminescence has not been reported in the past, but its 
absorption structure was reported long ago.[.sup]7[/] The 
emission from the bottom of the conduction band in the exciton 
confinement zone possibly originates from the bound excitons 
formed at the bottom of the band; however, further proof is 
needed. As to the luminescence phenomenon of solids at high 
energy level (or energy band), it is rarely seen in solid-state 
phases and many other nanocrystals. However, in our research we 
have observed that the phenomenon of increasing high 
energy-level radiation jumps not only takes place in the 
aforementioned Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals, but could also 
occur in the coated CdS and PbS nanocrystals. It is quite likely 
that in the high energy-level neighborhoods of the quantum 
confinement and dielectric confinement zones, stable bound 
excitons are formed, and consequently, they reduce the 
non-radiation jumping probability of the electrons or holes due 
to vibrations or impurities; thus, they enhance the radiation 
jumping. The phenomenon deserves further probing, because it has 
direct bearing on the enhancement of the system's nonlinear 
optical phenomena. 

  Figure 2 shows the excitation spectra of Cu[.sup]2[/]O 
nanocrystal (0.9 nm) emission at (a) 600 nm and (b) 580 nm. They 
are equivalent to the exciton wavelength absorption 
structure.[.sup]8[/] Figure 2 shows the exciton jumps in the 
indigo, blue, green, and yellow series are all mutually 
related,[.sup]6[/] and have an obvious relationship with the 
jump at about 380 nm. There is a corresponding spectral region 
of each individual series, and occasionally these spectral 
regions overlap. The relatively low vibrator absorption 
intensities of the yellow and green exciton series are caused by 
the dipole forbiddenness of the jump.[.sup]9[/]

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-10B>           Figure 2. Excitation Spectrum of Cu[.sup]2[/]Nanocrystal (9.0 nm) Sol </FIG>


  Another interesting phenomenon in the excitation spectra is 
that the dipoles allow the indigo and blue exciton series having 
the multi-peak structures of jumps. Such structures are caused 
by the quantization of the exciton energy which in turn is due 
to the spatial quantum confinement effect.[.sup]10[/] 
Hanamura[.sup]2[/] has suggested a simplified mode. He 
assumes the exciton to be a quasi-particle situated in a 
semiconducting nanosphere; when R/a[.sup]B[/] &gt; &gt;  1, the 
exciton energy (l = m = 0) that allows jumps is expressed as 
  E[.sup]n[/] = E[.sub]0[/] - 
E[.sup]b[/][.sup]ex[/] + 
n[.sup]2[/]E[.sup]c[/], (1) 
  where E[.sup]c[/] is the quantum confinement energy 
(h[.sup]2[/][.sup]2[/]/2 M R[.sup]2[/]) and 
E[.sup]b[/][.sup]ex[/] is the exciton bonding energy which 
varies with exciton's principal quantum number. The quantization 
of excitons follows the equation E[.sup]b[/][.sup]ex[/] = 
E[.sup]x[/]/n[.sup]2[/], where E[.sub]x[/] is the 
effective exciton Rydberg energy 
(e[.sup]4[/]/2h[.sup]2[/]_e_[.sup]2[/][.sup]0[/]), 
M = m[.sup]e[/] + m[.sub]h[/],  = 
m[.sup]e[/]m[.sub]h[/]/m[.sub]e[/] + m[.sub]h[/], 
and hence the equation 
  E[.sup]n[/] = E[.sub]0[/] - 
E[.sup]x[/]/n[.sup]2[/] + 
n[.sup]2[/]E[.sup]c[/] (2) 
  is used to describe the different exciton jumps with 
different principal quantum numbers in the same series. Our test 
results as shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 have proved the 
validity of Equation (2).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The aforementioned results demonstrate that the conclusion 
that the exciton energy increase in the exciton confinement zone 
is limited is valid only for the energy jump when n = 1. When n 
 2, the blue shift of the jump is relatively significant. In 
this case, exciton jumps of different principal quantum numbers 
split away from one another, while the nanocrystal optical 
nonlinear response produces mesoscopic 
strengthening.[.sup]2[/] This phenomenon will benefit our 
study of mutual reactions among the excitons within the exciton 
confinement zone, such as the super-radiation 
phenomenon.[.sup]1),11[/] Thorough research on the above 
phenomenon would be very worthwhile.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  SiC ultrafine powder is prepared by the CVD [chemical vapor 
deposition] method using low-molecular polysilane as precursor 
and argon as carrying gas. The relationships between the powder 
properties and the preparation factors such as reaction 
temperature, carrying-gas flow rate, and reactant densities are 
studied. The _b_-SiC ultrafine powder with uniform size (&lt; 
0.1 
m), high purity (30 weight percent of carbon content), and 
homogeneous crystalline structure is obtained through the 
decarbonization, deoxidization, and crystallization processes. 
  Key words: ultrafine silicon-carbide powder, CVD, 
low-molecular polysilane. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Due to its high-temperature mechanical properties, and good 
thermal shock-resistance property, SiC is one of the major 
materials in research on using high-temperature ceramics for 
engine parts.[.sup]1[/] 
  To make superior ceramics by a sintering method, one of the 
crucial techniques is to prepare ultrafine (nanoscale) ceramic 
powders having the properties of non-agglomeration, size 
uniformity, and high purity.[.sup]2[/] The best method to 
prepare SiC ultrafine powder is the chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD) method.[.sup]3[/] 
  Among the several CVD methods, one is to prepare the SiC 
ultrafine powder from reactions between silicon-content monomers 
(e.g., SiCl[.sup]4[/], SiH[.sub]4[/]) and carbon-content 
monomers (e.g., CH[.sup]4[/], 
C[.sup]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]),[.sup]4[/]; and another, from 
the thermal decomposition of organic silicon compounds 
containing both carbon and silicon (e.g., 
CH[.sup]3[/]SiCl[.sub]3[/], 
CH[.sup]3[/]SiH[.sub]3[/], 
[(CH[.sup]3[/])[.sub]2[/]Si][.sub]2[/], 
etc.).[.sup]2,5[/] However, in the monomer reactions, the 
existence of chlorine reduces the production rate, corrodes the 
equipment, and pollutes the environment. Moreover, when the 
carbon-to-silicon ratio (C/Si) is too low, too much free silicon 
is produced. Therefore, it is worthwhile to research other 
systems. 
  This paper studies the production factors of making SiC 
ultrafine powder from low-molecular polysilane (LPS), which is a 
by-product from synthesizing polyalkyl silane, as raw material 
and high-purity argon as carrying gas. The research also 
analyzes the composition, structure, and configuration of the 
ultrafine powder. 
<H5>  2. Experimental Work </H5>
  2.1 Raw Materials: LPS is a by-product generated 
from the cracking process of making polyalkyl silane from 
polysilane. It is a pale yellow liquid composed of organic 
silicon oligomers with different boiling points. These oligomers 
have chain or ring structures with 


<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-12A>           Equation </FIG>


  as the backbones, and an average molecular weight of 250. 
They vaporize completely at 300C. 
  2.2 Carrying Gas: The carrying gas is high-purity 
argon with 12 x 10[.sup]-6[/] of oxygen and 16.5 x 
10[.sup]-6[/] of H[.sup]2[/]O as analyzed with a DH-3C 
trace-oxygen analyzer and a US-1-1A trace-water analyzer, 
respectively. 
  2.3 Apparatus for Preparation of SiC Ultrafine 
Powder: As shown in Figure 1. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-12B>           Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of the Apparatus for Preparation of SiC Ultrafine Powder </FIG>


  2.4 Decarbonization, Deoxidization and 
Crystallization of the Ultrafine Powder: The SiC 
ultrafine-powder product from the reaction is amorphous. The 
powder is treated at 1600C for crystallization as well as 
decarbonization and deoxidization to remove the free carbon and 
oxygen in the ultrafine powder. 
  2.5 Ultrafine Powder Characteristics: The powder's 
infrared spectrum is obtained with a Hitachi 270-30 infrared 
spectrometer. The size and configuration of the powder are 
determined with a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope 
(TEM); the powder crystal structure, with a type D/max-IIIA 
X-ray diffractometer; and the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen 
contents, with a USA PE2400CHN element analyzer. 
<H5>  3. Results and Discussions </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Effects of Reaction Temperature </H5>
  Under the condition that the argon flow rate is controlled 
at 
0.24 L/min; and LPS flow rate, 0.025 g/min, different powder 
batches are made within the temperature range of 900 to 
1300C, as shown in the TEM photos in Figure 2. The reaction 
temperature has little effect on the particle size and 
configuration. The powder diameters are between 0.05 and 0.1 
m with very narrow distribution, and most particles are 
spherical. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-13A>           Figure 2. SEM Photographs of SiC Powder Synthesized at Different Temperatures </FIG>


  Figure 3 shows the relationship between the powder's carbon 
and the hydrogen contents and the reaction temperature. The 
carbon content increases and the hydrogen content decreases with 
the increase of the reaction temperature. The fact that the 
hydrogen content in the SiC product is zero at the reaction 
temperature 1300C indicates that the transformation of the 
organic LPS to the inorganic SiC is complete. In LPS, the ratio 
of carbon to silicon is 2:1, therefore the total carbon content 
in the ultrafine powder exceeds the theoretical value (30 weight 
percent) and free carbon exists in the final product. At low 
temperature, the main cracking product is CH[.sup]4[/] which 
will be carried out by the gas flow; as a result, the carbon 
content is comparatively low for the low-temperature reaction 
product. At high temperature, the cracking product is mainly 
H[.sup]2[/], therefore the free-carbon content in the product 
increases. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-13B>           Figure 3. Effect of Reaction Temperature on the C and H Mass Content in SiC Powder </FIG>

  Figure 4 depicts the infrared spectra of products obtained 
at 
different temperatures. It shows that as the temperature 
increases, the transformation of the organic LPS to the 
inorganic SiC is gradually completed. At 450 cm[.sup]-1[/], 
there is a Si-O absorption peak. As the temperature increases, 
the peak becomes weaker. The existence of the Si-O bond is 
caused by the infusion of oxygen, one of the impurities in LPS. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-13C>           Figure 4. Infrared Spectra of LPS and Its Pyrolytic Products Obtained at Different Reaction Temperatures </FIG>

<H5>  3.2 Effects of Carrying-Gas Flow Rate </H5>
  When the reaction temperature is controlled at 1100C 
and 
LPS flow rate at 0.025 g/min, at different argon flow rates, the 
ultrafine powders remain spherical. When the argon flow rates 
are 0.088 L/min, 0.24 L/min, and 0.535 L/min, the diameters of 
the ultrafine powder are 0.1 m, 0.075 m, and 0.04 
m, 
respectively. The SiC ultrafine-powder diameter decreases with 
an increase in the argon flow rate. The SiC ultrafine-powder 
growth is a kinetics phenomenon. After SiC ultrafine powder is 
formed, its growth depends on its length of stay in the furnace. 
The higher the carrying-gas flow rate, the shorter the SiC's 
stay in the furnace, consequently the finer the powder produced. 
<H5>  3.3 Effects of LPS Flow Rate </H5>
  When the furnace temperature is controlled at 1100C and 
argon flow rate at 0.24 L/min, SiC ultrafine powders are 
prepared at different LPS flow rates. The results show that when 
the LPS flow rate is at 0.025, 0.065, or 0.160 g/min, all 
powders are spherical having a diameter 0.75 m, which 
indicates that the LPS flow rate does not affect the size or the 
configuration of the SiC ultrafine powder. 
<H3>  3.4 Decarbonization, Deoxidization, and Crystallization of 
SiC Ultrafine Powder </H3>
  As aforementioned, the SiC ultrafine powder prepared by this 
method contains free carbon and SiO[.sup]2[/], which as 
impurities produce unfavorable effects on the material; thus, 
decarbonization and deoxidization are needed. Besides, the 
prepared SiC ultrafine powder is amorphous, therefore, 
crystallization is also needed. 
  To achieve the purpose of decarbonization and deoxidization 
and in the meantime crystallization, this process utilizes 
high-temperature (about 1500C) reaction in which free 
carbon reduces SiO[.sup]2[/] and forms gaseous SiO and CO, 
which eventually evaporate. At the same time the crystallization 
is also completed. The XRD results (Figure 5) show that as the 
crystallization temperature increases, the SiC ultrafine powder 
gradually transforms from the amorphous state to the _b_-SiC 
crystalline state. When the reaction temperature reaches 
1500C, _b_-SiC is virtually completely crystallized, and 
no other phases are observed. 


  Figure 4 shows that after crystallization for 2 hours at 
1500C, the infrared absorption peak at 450 cm[.sup]-1[/] 
in the SiC ultrafine-powder spectrum disappears, which indicates 
that the powder is deoxidized. 
  The element analysis shows that the carbon content of 
decarbonized SiC drops from 39.54 percent to 30.15 percent, 
which is basically close to the theoretical carbon content (30 
percent) of SiC. The fact that the color of the ultrafine powder 
changes from brownish to whitish also indicates that the powder 
is completely decarbonized. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-14A>           XRD Patterns of SiC Powder Treated at Different Temperatures </FIG>

<H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>
  (1) The LPS CVD technique can produce SiC ultrafine powder. 
The technique is feasible because of its low processing 
temperature, lack of corrosion, and simple procedures. 
  (2) The carbon and hydrogen contents are mainly controlled 
by 
the reaction temperatures: the higher the reaction temperature, 
the higher the carbon content, and the lower the hydrogen 
content. The SiC ultrafine-powder size is controlled by the 
carrying-gas flow rate: the higher the flow rate, the smaller 
the particle size. 
  (3) After the transformation from LPS, the SiC powder 
product 
is always carbon rich. After the decarbonization, deoxidization, 
and crystallization treatment, high-purity, uniform-sized and 
almost completely crystallized spherical _b_-SiC ultrafine 
powder can be obtained.

Film,'' funded by NSFC and the CAS Major Projects Fund; MS 
received 19 Mar 93, revised 3 Jul 93] 
  [Text] Nanoscale Si thin film (nc-Si:H) is a nanoscale 
material composed of nanoscale ultrafine 
crystals.[.sup]1,2[/] The material contains 50 volume percent 
of crystals, and the other 50 percent contains a large number of 
interface atoms which greatly affect the structure and the 
property of the nanoscale material.[.sup]3[/] Because of the 
novelty of the nanoscale Si thin-film structures, the film has a 
series of special characteristics that are different from 
crystalline or amorphous materials made of similar substances. 
These optical characteristics present application 
potential.[.sup]4,5[/] 
  The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) developed in the 
early 1980s has been widely used in different 
fields.[.sup]6,7[/] The study of polycrystalline Si thin film 
with STM has achieved some results,[.sup]8-11[/] mainly in 
the exploration of the film's surface characteristics and 
topography. However, so far there has been no report of STM 
research on the nanoscale material's crystal interface, which 
has an important effect on the structure and properties of the 
nanoscale material. In this paper, we utilize a locally made STM 
to study the surfaces of nanoscale Si thin films whose thickness 
varies from sub-micron to atomic scale. A series of data, 
especially on the crystal interface structures, is obtained. 
<H5>  1. Experimental Method </H5>
  The nanoscale Si thin-film specimen is prepared with a 
plasma 
capacitively coupled chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system, 
with highly hydrogen-diluted silane as the reaction gas, and by 
the excitation of an r.f. + DC double-power 
source.[.sup]1,2[/] 
  The instrument used in the research is a type CSTM-9000 STM 
for atmospheric use,[.sup]12[/] manufactured by the CAS 
Institute of Chemistry and equipped with a needle made of 
80Pt-20Ir alloy (diameter: 0.25mm) by mechanical cutting or a 
tungsten needle (diameter: 0.25mm) made by chemical etching. In 
a constant-current operating mode, each image is sampled with 
180 x 180 points. The surface heights are reflected by the 
varying shades of grayish color in the image. The voltage 
between the needle and the specimen tunnel junction is between 
0.5 V and 2 V, with needle as positive. The maximum tunnel 
current selected for use has reached 1 nA, and generally is 
about 0.5 nA. In the following test results, the STM images are 
only the outcomes after the original data were smoothed. The 
scanning time for each image varies: from 3 min (for large 
images) to 15 s (for small images). 
<H5>  2. Results and Discussion </H5>
  The STM images of nanoscale Si thin film of different 
magnifications in atmosphere are displayed from sub-micron to 
atomic dimensions. Figure 1 shows the obverse STM image of the 
nanoscale Si thin film obtained with the tungsten needle. The 
needle bias is 1 volt; and the current, 0.45 nA. The scanning 
areas of Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are 40.9 nm (x-direction) x 48.8 
nm (y-direction), and 20.5 nm x 24.4 nm, respectively. Figure 1 
shows that the nanoscale Si thin film is composed of many 
ultrafine particles. The densities of the surface particle 
arrangements vary. The particle boundaries are very clear. From 
Figures 1(a), and 1(b) especially, the sizes of the nanoscale Si 
thin-film particles can be estimated as 3 nm-5 nm, which closely 
coincide with the results from high-resolution electron 
microscopy (HREM).[.sup]1,2[/] The image obtained with the 
mechanically cut Pt/Ir needle shows comparatively smooth regions 
between the nanoscale particles in the nanoscale Si thin film, 
due to the large radius of curvature of the mechanically cut 
Pt/Ir needle tip.[.sup]13[/] Figure 2 shows the 
three-dimensional STM near-atomic image of the nanoscale Si thin 
film obtained with the Pt/Ir needle. The STM parameters are: 
needle bias V[.sup]t[/] = 1.0 V; tunnel currents 
I[.sup]t[/] are 0.4 nA and 0.6 nA for Figures 2(a) and 2(b), 
respectively; and the scanning areas are 4.10 nm x 4.88 nm and 
1.7 nm x 1.0 nm, respectively. Figure 2(a) shows that the atoms 
in the brighter areas arrange in an orderly pattern, and the 
darker areas are the boundary surfaces of the crystals where the 
atom arrangements are somewhat random. This observation 
essentially coincides with Gleiter's nanoscale material 
structural model.[.sup]3[/] Two scratch marks caused by the 
unstable needle are displayed in Figure 2(a). Figure 2(b) 
displays the orderly arrangement of atoms with a distance of 
about 3 Angstroms between neighboring atoms. At this position, 
we believe that the area of STM observation is focused on the 
particle. Since the particle is crystalline,[.sup]1,2[/] the 
orderly arrangement of the atoms is observable. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-16A>           Figure 1. Plane Image of Nanoscale Si Thin Film </FIG>

  This experiment has found that the needle bias for image 
formation should not be too low to cause needle instability, 
which is probably due to the nanoscale Si thin-film surface 
oxidation. On the other hand, during the preparation of the 
nanoscale Si thin-film specimen, the reaction between silicon 
and hydrogen may hinder the surface oxidation. These results are 
only preliminary. Further study is in progress. 
<H5>  3. Conclusions </H5>
  The STM study of nanoscale Si thin film reveals that this 
film is composed of nanoscale particles with average particle 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-16B>           Figure 2. Three-Dimensional STM Near-Atomic Image of Nanoscale Si Thin Film </FIG>

size of 3 nm-5 nm. Through the STM's high-resolution imaging 
capability, the near-atomic images on the thin-film surface are 
directly observed. The images show that the atom arrangement of 
the nanoscale particles is orderly, and the atom arrangement 
between the particles is comparatively random. These results 
coincide with past observations by HREM, and further disclose 
the microstructure of the nanoscale Si thin film.

SnO[.sup]2[/],'' funded by NSFC and the USTC Structural 
Analysis Open Laboratory Foundation] 
  [Text] SnO[.sup]2[/] nanoscale crystal powder is 
prepared with a hot-water method as follows: The metallic tin 
powder is mixed with nitric acid and the reaction turns the 
mixture into a transparent solution. The solution is then mixed 
with polytetrafluoroethylene and loaded in an autoclave at 
150C for 24 hours. After the treated solution is cooled to 
room temperature, white SnO[.sup]2[/] powder is obtained. The 
powder is washed thoroughly, baked at 150C for 24 hours, 
and then pressed into a plate under a pressure of 
10[.sup]5[/] kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. The initial particle size of 
the specimen is 3 nm. After annealing at different temperatures, 
nanoscale SnO[.sup]2[/] powders of different particle sizes 
are obtained. The powder crystal structure belongs to the rutile 
type, and there is less than 1 percent of impurities in the 
powder. 
  The Raman spectrum is measured with a U.S. SPEX-1403 laser 
Raman spectrometer. The excitation light is the 514.5-nm line 
from an argon-ion laser. The backscatter configuration is 
adopted. All measurements are conducted at room temperature. 
  Figure 1 shows that the peaks in the Raman spectra are of 
two 
different groups: the peaks in one group, called mode A, 
correspond with the peaks in the monocrystalline or 
polycrystalline SnO[.sup]2[/] spectra. The Raman spectrum 
peaks with wave numbers of 472, 632, and 773 cm[.sup]-1[/] 
are designated as A[.sup]1[/], A[.sub]2[/], and 
A[.sup]3[/], respectively. In the other group, called mode B, 
the peaks with wave numbers of 358 and 572 cm[.sup]-1[/] are 
designated as B[.sup]1[/] and B[.sub]2[/], respectively. 
The mode-B peaks do not exist in the monocrystalline or 
polycrystalline SnO[.sup]2[/] Raman spectra. This observation 
indicates that the appearance of B[.sup]1[/] and 
B[.sup]2[/] peaks is caused by the nanoscale effect. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-17A>           Figure 1. Raman Spectra of Different Nanoscale SnO[.sup]2[/] Solids </FIG>


  All the peak intensities in Figure 1 are normalized 
according 
to the intensity of peak A[.sup]2[/]. As shown in Figure 1, 
the intensity ratios of the peaks in mode B to the peaks in mode 
A increase rapidly with decrease in crystal size. This 
observation is similar to the phenomenon wherein surface-atom 
fractions rapidly increase with decrease in crystal size. We 
assume that the B[.sup]1[/] and B[.sub]2[/] peaks are 
caused by the surface phonon modes and are closely related to 
the A[.sup]1[/] and A[.sub]2[/] peaks. This experiment 
shows that the frequencies of the B[.sup]1[/] and 
B[.sup]2[/] peaks are lower than those of the A[.sub]1[/] 
and A[.sup]2[/] peaks. The appearance of the low-frequency 
surface phonon modes is induced by the relaxation among the 
surface atoms. This relaxation weakens the interaction among the 
surface atoms, and consequently reduces the surface force 
coefficient. 
  Calculations based on the Raman spectra of nanoscale solid 
materials are expected to generate the specific positions of the 
nanoscale surface atoms.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  The property parameters for thermal-stress optimization 
design of the MgO/Ni-system functionally gradient materials 
(MgO/Ni FGM) are determined by experimental measurements as well 
as by calculations according to a micromechanical model. The 
causes of different results achieved by these two methods are 
discussed. The finite element method is used to simulate the 
thermal stress in FGM during its preparation. The consolidated 
rules for MgO/Ni FGM design postulation are obtained. Based on 
design results, progressive adjustments of powder technology 
properties are made. Consequently, MgO/Ni FGM is successfully 
sintered. 
  Key words: Functionally gradient material, thermal stress, 
microstructure, design, preparation. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Metal/ceramic-system functionally gradient materials (FGMs) 
are new composite materials having applications potential in 
such high-tech fields as aerospace, nuclear energy, 
etc.[.sup]1[/] Whether they can eventually be put into 
practical application depends on the crucial elimination of 
fractures caused by the thermal stress induced from different 
gradient layer properties. 
  MgO/Ni-system sintered bodies of various compositions are 
prepared by the powder spreading-filling method. Their basic 
property parameters for thermal-stress optimization design are 
measured. The causes of differences between these parameters and 
calculated values are discussed. Based on test data, the thermal 
stress induced during the MgO/Ni-system FGM (MgO/Ni FGM) 
preparation is simulated with the finite element method, and 
based on the consolidated analysis of the magnitudes and 
distributions of stresses, a principle of material structure and 
composition distribution is proposed. Guided by design results 
and considerations of such production technology factors as 
strengths of the transition layers and property data, as well as 
sintering shrinkage and densification conditions, MgO/Ni FGM 
plates are prepared. 
<H5>  2. Measurement and Evaluation of Property Parameters </H5>
<H3>  2.1 Material System Selection and Preparation for Sintered 
Bodies of Different Compositions </H3>
  The MgO/Ni composite system is selected because of MgO 
ceramic's superior high-temperature stability, high-temperature 
basic vapor corrosion resistance, high-temperature insulation, 
etc. Additionally, the thermal expansion difference between MgO 
and nickel is small. The gradient combination of these two 
materials has high potential to be used as the inner-wall 
material for the ducts of magnetohydrodynamic 
generators.[.sup]2[/] 
  The raw materials are MgO microfine powder and nickel 
carbonyl powder. Both materials have greater than 99.5 percent 
purity. The particle size for MgO is 0.3 m; for nickel 
carbonyl powder, 5 m. Each of the powder mixes of different 
MgO/Ni volume compositions is loaded in a separate pack and 
isostatically compacted under 100 MPa pressure. The pressed 
specimens are then sintered in 1.0 x 10[.sup]-2[/] Pa vacuum. 
Considering the nickel sintering temperature, we set the 
sintering conditions at 1300C for 100 minutes. The sintered 
bodies are cut and polished for experimentation. 
<H5>  2.2 Properties of Sintered Specimens </H5>
  The specimen property parameters of six sintered 
compositions 
are measured. Their results are listed in the following table.

10[.sup]6[/]/K[.sup]-1[/] 


  The table shows that the bending strengths of the sintered 
specimens are closely related to their relative densities. The 
lowest relative density of specimen C corresponds to its lowest 
bending strength. In addition, among the three major property 
parameters for finite element simulation, only the thermal 
expansion coefficient _a_ has an approximately linear 
relationship with the volume fraction; the other two values, 
Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio _n_, obviously depend on 
the microstructure of the sintered specimens. Figure 1 shows the 
variation of the measured data of relative density and Young's 
modulus with the volume fraction of nickel. Figure 2 shows the 
variation of thermal expansion coefficient and Poisson's ratio 
with the volume fraction of nickel. For analytical convenience, 
the figures also contain the curves denoting the corresponding 
property changes with the changing of composition calculated 
from the micromechanical model of Wakashima.[.sup]3[/] When 
the nickel content is increased, the variation patterns of the 
calculated values and the experimental values of the sintered 
specimen's Young's modulus are similar, except at the point of 
40-volume-percent nickel; besides, the calculated density 
variations correspond to the experimental variations. The 
calculated value of E is minimum at 60 volume percent of nickel; 
however, the fact that the experimental E is not minimum at 40 
volume percent of nickel but higher than the E values of the two 
neighboring points indicates that Young's modulus is 
strengthened at this point. The strengthening characteristic 
also occurs in Poisson's ratio _n_. At the same point of 
40-volume-percent nickel fraction, the value of _n_ is 0.27, 
which is also higher than the _n_ values of the two neighboring 
points. The phenomenon that material property parameter at a 
certain composition displays abnormal strengthening, which 
disagrees with the Wakashima equation, is caused by the 
exceptional sintered microstructure at that particular 
composition. Experiments show that specimens B, D, and E display 
typical dispersion structures, i.e., MgO as second phase 
disperses in the nickel matrix, or vice versa. However, the 
microstructure of specimen C is different, as it displays a 
geometric network structure with a continuous crisscross of 
nickel and MgO. This network structure strengthens E and _n_. 
Since Wakashima's model is based on the sparse-dispersion 
micro-geometrical structure, it cannot describe the properties 
of materials with network structures.

<H5>  3. Thermal Stress Simulation and Structural Design </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Computed Model </H5>
  The computed model uses the prepared disk specimen, 6mm 
thick 
and 30mm in diameter, which is sliced into 15 layers according 
to the composition. The specimen is cooled to room temperature 
from 1000C. The measured properties are used as model 
parameters. The properties of the intermediate gradient layers 
are obtained through interpolations of the tested data. A power 
function is used to describe the volume fraction variations of 
different gradient layers. The composition distribution curves 
from different indices P are expressed by the equation C = 
(x/d)[.sup]P[/];[.sup]4[/] where d is the total thickness 
of each gradient layer, x is the position coordinate of any 
gradient layer, and P is the distribution index which determines 
the configuration of the composition distribution curve C. At 
the plate's 1/4 cross section, we make the finite-element 
network partitions, and assign different composition 
distribution indices accordingly, then simulate the thermal 
stress in the specimen with the finite element method. 
<H5>  3.2 Analysis of Computed Results </H5>
  In the computation, the P value varies from 0.6 to 2.8. The 
results show that a distinct thermal relaxation effect occurs 
for any FGM composition distribution, and the maximum stress 
boundary moves toward the nickel-rich side. When P = 0.6, the 
maximum radial stress component _s_[.sup]rr[/] is 96 MPa, 
which indicates a thermal stress relaxation rate of 35 percent, 
as compared with the thermal stress of the double-layered Ni-MgO 
FGM (NFGM); when P = 1.8, the relaxation rate is as high as 70 
percent. 
  Figure 3 shows the variation of the maximum 
_s_[.sup]zz[/], _s_[.sub]rr[/], and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] 

with the P values. All three stresses have minimum values in the 
areas of P variations and all appear in the neighborhood of P = 
1.8. Comparatively speaking, the axial stress _s_[.sup]zz[/] 
is very small, about 1/4 of the radial stress _s_[.sup]rr[/] 
and the ring stress _s_[.sup]_th__th_[/]. This is due to the 
fact that for the FGM specimens of this experiment, the ratio of 
the gradient thickness to the diameter is 0.13. Large axial 
stress cannot be induced from this small thickness-to-diameter 
ratio.[.sup]4[/] Therefore, the FGM structural design must 
take _s_[.sup]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] as the main 
control stresses. 

  Figure 3 shows that the _s_ value is minimum when P = 1.6 
to 
1.8. Whether this P value would provide the best design will be 
discussed later in this paper. Figure 4 shows the variation of 
maximum stress location center with index P (in the graph, h is 
the distance from the center line to the pure nickel side). 
Figure 4 also shows the corresponding FGM gradient layer to the 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-20A>           Figure 3. Maximum Thermal Stresses vs. Various Compositional Distribution Power </FIG>

maximum stress location. We can see that the location of the 
maximum stress changes with the P value. After the P value 
reaches 1.2, the location of the maximum stress center drops 
sharply; as the P value continuously increases the maximum 
stress center moves downward and approaches the model's 
symmetrical center line. The right coordinate of Figure 4 shows 
that the center line is located at the layer with 40 percent of 
MgO, which is the weaker section (measured value is 42 MPa) of 
the gradient material. Comparing with Figure 3, we can see that 
even when P = 1.8, the stress is at the minimum value of 40 MPa; 
this minimum value is very close to the allowable material 
strength; hence, the failure would naturally occur at the center 
line of the radial direction. When P = 1.0, the maximum stress 
center occurs at 0.8 h, which is the straight nickel layer. 
Referring to both Figure 3 and Figure 4, although 
_s_[.sup]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] are comparatively 
high (about 60 MPa), they are still far below the actual test 
strength (163 MPa) of the straight nickel layer. Besides, the 
computed stress diagram also shows that when the P value 
changes, even though the straight ceramic side is generally 
under compressive stress, a tensile symptom still displays at 
the neighborhood of the circumference of 0.9 R (R is the radius 
of the round FGM plate) on the horizontal surface and the axial 
direction of the ceramic side. The tensile stress, however small 
(especially _s_[.sup]zz[/]), should be included in the 
analysis. As shown in Figure 5, the local tensile stress on the 
straight ceramic side at P = 1.6 is minimum. When P = 1.8, the 
local tensile stress _s_[.sup]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] 

are both smaller than 40 MPa, which is far smaller than the 
allowable measured strength.

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-21B>           Figure 5. Tensile Stresses in the Part of MgO-Side vs. Various Distribution Power </FIG>


  In conclusion, even the composition distribution index P 
that 
represents the best thermal stress relaxation effect cannot 
completely reflect the correct structural control parameters. 
All the following three conditions must be considered: 
  (1) the target P value which represents the minimum thermal 
stress; 
  (2) the adjusted P value so that the location of thermal 
stress occurs as close to the metallic side as possible; 
  (3) whether the corresponding P value would induce a tensile 
stress far smaller than the allowable strength on the straight 
ceramic side. 
  Based on these considerations, the best FGM design can be 
obtained and the FGM material composition distribution can be 
determined. This is the basic principle of structural design to 
avoid fractures in the FGM during its preparation. Based on the 
above, the design outcome is P = 1.0. 
<H5>  4. Preparation of Functionally Gradient Materials </H5>
  MgO/Ni FGMs are prepared according to the design result P = 
1.0. Fifteen layers of MgO/Ni powder of different compositions 
are piled by the layer-filling technique, then the green 
compacts are either vacuum sintered, or hot-pressing (HP) 
sintered. 
<H5>  4.1 Adjustment of Compacting and Sintering of Powder Mix </H5>
  During vacuum FGM sintering, in the periods of temperature 
rising, sintering, and cooling, the compacts are not constrained 
by any external forces. Therefore, adjustments of the compacting 
property and the sintering property are possible, which is 
particularly important for a defect-free specimen. In this 
experiment, two different types of MgO powder, both mixed with 
0.5 weight percent of Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder, are 
used. One is fluffy microfine powder decomposed from 
Mg(OH)[.sup]2[/]. The average particle size is about 0.3 
m. The other is fine powder thermally decomposed from 
MgSO[.sup]4[/]-7H[.sub]2[/]O. The average particle size is 
about 3 m. When the mixes are made of exclusively 0.3 m 
fluffy powder and nickel powder, the variation of compacting 
densities and sintering shrinkages with the MgO composition is 
as shown in Figure 6. Because of the considerable variations 
among the specimen compact densities (especially in the straight 
ceramic specimens, the differences between the axial pressed 
compacts and the compacts further treated with 100 MPa cold 
isostatic pressing are very wide), and the relatively low final 
straight ceramic compact density, stress-induced cracks 
frequently occur on the straight ceramic side of the laminated 
compacts. To solve this problem, 15 to 35 weight percent of 
large-particle (d = 3 m) MgO powder is added. The addition 
of 
large-particle MgO powder increases the MgO compact density, and 
also reduces the shrinkage differences among the sintered 
specimens. The previous table shows that the densification rates 
of all specimens used in structural designs are fairly low with 
high degrees of porosity, which is mainly affected by the 
sintering parameters and densification technique. To meet the 
sintering temperature of nickel powder and reduce the 
densification sintering temperature of MgO so that the sintering 
properties of nickel powder and MgO become compatible, about 0.5 
weight percent of Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder is 
added.[.sup]5[/] After this treatment, almost all the 
specimen relative densities reach 90 percent after sintering at 
1320C for 2.5 hours. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-22A>           Figure 6. Formation Density and Sintering Shrinkage for MgO/Ni Mixtures </FIG>


  After the aforementioned adjustments, the green compacts of 
various compositions are used to determine the sintering 
shrinkage rate changes from room temperature up to 1250C at 
a constant temperature increasing rate. The results are shown in 
Figure 7. For all but the straight MgO specimen, the sintering 
shrinking rate increases with the increase of nickel content, 
but the difference of the shrinkage magnitudes between any two 
neighboring specimens is small. Basically, a balance of the 
sintering shrinkages is achieved. The straight MgO specimen 
contains about 70 weight percent of microfine powder, and 
produces an uncoordinated shrinking situation with its 
neighboring layers. During the FGM's actual lamination, 
compaction, and sintering, the straight nickel side has a higher 
compaction density due to isostatic cold pressing. Hence the 
diameter of the ceramic side is larger than that of the straight 
metal side (by about 6 percent). However, the ``uncoordinated'' 
shrinkage offsets the existing dimension difference during 
compaction, and eventually a uniform FGM specimen is prepared. 

  In conclusion, quality FGM can only be made according to the 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-22B>           Figure 7. Sintering Shrinkage of MgO/Ni Mixtures With Various Mixing Ratios </FIG>

basic structural design principles when the preparation 
conditions such as powder particle size, additives, compact 
deformation, sintering shrinkage, etc. are adjusted and 
controlled in coordinated fashion. 
<H5>  4.2 Preparation of FGM </H5>
  Two FGM disc specimens of the MgO/Ni system with about 6mm 
thickness, and diameters of 24mm and 30mm are made by vacuum 
sintering and HP sintering, respectively. The vacuum sintering 
parameters are as follows: 1320C, 2.5 hours, and 1 x 
10[.sup]-2[/] Pa vacuum; and the HP sintering parameters: 
1300C, 28 MPa pressing pressure, and 1 hour. Figure 8 shows 
the prepared specimens. During the HP sintering, the pressure is 
released at about 1000C, and MgO displays high-temperature 
plastic deformation,[.sup]6[/] hence, the thermal stress is 
sufficiently relaxed in the course of HP sintering to pressure 
releasing. Therefore, the specimen prepared by HP sintering has 
a larger diameter and no surface defects. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-23A>           Figure 8. MgO/Ni FGM Samples Prepared by Different Sintering Methods </FIG>


<H5>  5. Conclusions </H5>
  (1) The experimental method and the micromechanical model 
are 
used to measure and calculate the property parameters of the 
sintered bodies of the MgO/Ni system with various compositions. 
The results show that the specimen's sintering strength is 
mainly controlled by porosity; the coefficient of thermal 
expansion follows a quasi-linear variation; and Young's modulus 
and Poisson's ratio are strengthened at 40 volume percent of 
nickel content. The implication is that Wakashima's 
micromechanical model cannot yet truthfully describe the 
micro-network structure of the sintered body. 
  (2) The thermal stress simulation of a FGM model with a 
thickness-to-diameter ratio of 0.13 shows that compared with 
NFGM, FGM clearly has a thermal stress relaxation effect, and 
the maximum stress boundary layer moves significantly toward the 
metal side. The degree of relaxation depends on the distribution 
index P. The minimum values of the three major stress components 
occur when P = 1.8 (when the stress relaxation is 70 percent). 
  (3) However, the best material structural design condition 
is 
not when P = 1.8. When factors such as the structural location 
of the maximum stress, the strength of the gradient layer at the 
same location of the maximum stress, and furthermore, the 
tensile strength of the straight ceramic side are considered, 
the best combined design condition for MgO/Ni FGM is when P = 
1.0. 
  (4) Based on P = 1.0, when factors such as raw-material 
particle size, sintering properties, and the balance between 
compact contraction and sintering shrinkage are adjusted, FGM of 
the MgO/Ni system without macroscopical surface defect can be 
prepared by vacuum sintering and HP sintering methods.

Industry Enters Benign Cycle: Import and Export Trade Turnover 
Has First Surplus''] 
  [Summary] China's computer industry import and export trade 
turnover this year recorded its first surplus. According to 
official statistics, the nation's 1993 gross volume of computer 
imports and exports was US$2.139 billion, of which imports 
amounted to $1.05 billion and exports to $1.088 billion. This 
first trade surplus for the 30-odd-year-old domestic computer 
industry indicates that this industry has entered the 
development phase of a benign cycle [between economic 
activities]. 
  While exports of computer hardware parts and boards continue 
to form the bulk of China's computer exports, a growing 
percentage comes from application software and other kinds of 
software. Analyzing the reasons for the nation's first 
computer-industry trade surplus, Yang Tianxing [2799 1131 5887], 
director of the Ministry of Electronics Industry's Computer 
Department, commented that the dominant position of China's 
computer industry in terms of labor, talent, and technology is 
gradually coming into play amid international market 
competition, and that the production scale of the three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises is gradually growing -- both reasons 
being critical factors for foreign-exchange-earning exports.

in the field of computer high-speed [100 Mbits/s] local area 
networks, or LANs. 
  In the past, China has had to expend large amounts of 
foreign 
exchange for imports of fiber optic network cards. But in 
September 1993, the Shenzhen firm put out its first card, 
filling a domestic void. Now, the FDDI cards have been 
authenticated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, and 
have rapidly entered the domestic and foreign markets.

  [Summary] Beijing (XINHUA) -- The U.S. firm IBM Corporation 
recently in Beijing reached formal agreement with Beijing Wangma 
[3769 4316] Computer Corporation to purchase rights to use the 
patented ``Five-Stroke Character Type'' [wu bi zixing] computer 
Chinese-character input technique. This technique, invented by 
Wangma Computer Corp. Governor Professor Wang Yongming [3769 
3057 2494], has been patented in three nations--the U.S., 
Britain, and China. The technique covers 90 percent of domestic 
computer users and has found applications in the U.N. and 
Southeast Asia. The U.S. firm DEC and the Japanese firm Casio 
already reached agreement with Wangma Corp. for rights to use 
this patented technique, which has become for foreign computer 
makers a ``key'' to opening up the China market.

Research Ascends to Advanced International Level: 
Fifth-Generation Industrial Robots Now on Market''] 
  [Summary] Beijing, 8 Jan (XINHUA)--Nine varieties of 
domestic fifth-generation industrial robots are now on the 
market. These robots--used for arc welding, spot welding, spray 
painting, assembly, transport, teaching, research, and handling 
of toxic substances and explosives--meet advanced international 
standards for variety, performance, quality, and reliability. 
  The arc-welding and spot-welding robots, developed by the 
China Aerospace Corporation's (CASC) Institute 17 along with 
other units, have ``teaching and playback'' intelligent 
functions. The spray-painting robot, developed by CASC's 
Institute 706 along with other units, can grasp 10-kg objects 
and has a repeat positioning accuracy of 2mm. An 
electronic-component mounting robot with visual recognition 
functions has a repeat positioning accuracy of 0.03mm. These 
robots are now in batch production, and have found applications 
in the arc-welding and spray-painting assembly lines for the 
``Audi'' bus, made at the No. 1 Automotive Works, and the 
``Dongfeng'' [East Wind] truck, made at the No. 2 Automotive 
Works.

  [Summary] Guangzhou (ZHONGGUO KEXUE BAO report)--As part of 
the ``Global Remote Sensing Plan'' jointly developed by the CAS 
Institute of Remote Sensing Applications and the Canadian 
National Remote Sensing Center, engineers on 21 and 22 November 
[1993] flew over the Zhaoqing Prefecture of Guangdong Province 
and successfully completed radar remote sensing flight imaging 
tasks including real-time acquisition of perfectly clear images. 
These images, to be used for development and exploration of 
agricultural, forest, mineral, and water resources, were 
captured with a high-resolution side-looking synthetic aperture 
radar (SAR) and other advanced instruments carried on board the 
Canadian CV-580 aircraft flying at an altitude of 5,500 meters 
and having an imaging range of over 8,000 square kilometers. The 
current cooperative project with Canada, in addition to the 
aforementioned radar imaging flights, also included a symposium, 
data processing and analysis, and academic interchanges. Chinese 
scientists and engineers commented that the project will 
inevitably improve the nation's technological level in radar 
remote sensing, and scientists on both sides expressed 
satisfaction with the successful implementation of the plan 
flights.

Electron Laser Facility Achieves Another Major Breakthrough: 
Successfully Realizes Saturated Oscillation, a State-of-the-Art 
Accomplishment''] 
  [Summary] Beijing, 14 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION 
report) -- This writer learned today from sources at the CAS 
Institute of High-Energy Physics that the institute's Beijing 
Free Electron Laser (BFEL) facility, which achieved infrared FEL 
oscillation over six months ago [see JPRS-CST-93-013, 27 Jul 93 
p 18], recently had another major breakthrough. On 28 December 
1993, the BFEL facility successfully realized saturated 
oscillation, becoming the world's first infrared FEL 
facility--among the 10-odd such installations built in the 
United States, West Europe, and elsewhere--to reach this goal 
and thus propelling China into the world's front ranks in this 
high-tech field. The BFEL facility first achieved infrared FEL 
oscillation on 26 May last year, making China the fourth 
nation--after the United States, the Netherlands, and France--to 
use a radio-frequency linear accelerator for generating infrared 
FEL light. Following that achievement, BFEL facility scientists 
succeeded in raising the electron beam density and improving the 
uniformity of the quality factor; this in turn permitted them to 
raise system gain from the original 6 percent to 17 percent, 
where saturated oscillation took place. Also, compared to last 
May's achievement, stimulated oscillation signal strength is now 
5 orders of magnitude higher [i.e., 100,000 times as high] and 
spontaneous radiation strength is 8 orders of magnitude higher.

  [Abstract] Based on the theory of MTF (modulation transfer 
function) in Fourier optics, the features of a VISSR 
(visible-infrared spin scan radiometer) optical imaging system 
are analyzed. A criterion and method for VISSR focusing are 
proposed and the experimental results for frequency-spectrum 
analysis using fast Fourier transforms (FFT) on stretched 
digital cloud images received from the Japanese GMS-4 satellite 
are given. The tests show that this method is useful and 
practical for in-orbit focusing control of a GMS's VISSR. 
  Figure 1, not reproduced, is a flow chart for VISSR 
focusing.

  [Abstract] An FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) 
magneto-optical spectrometer with high optical transmission 
efficiency has been developed from a novel design. The 
instrument's construction and characteristics are described, and 
test results including typical spectra are given. The system is 
based on a Brueker 113V FTIR spectrometer, with an operating 
spectral range of 10-10,000 cm[.sup]-1[/] and a maximum 
resolution of 0.03 cm[.sup]-1[/]. The liquid-helium 
Dewar/superconducting magnet system is an Oxford S11/12L-40-13, 
with a magnetic-cavity effective diameter of 40mm and a maximum 
field strength of 12 T. The five-reflector imaging system is 
independently developed. Overall system transmission efficiency 
is 0.37 (37 percent). 
  Figure 1, reproduced below, is a schematic diagram of the 
entire system, while Figures 2 and 3, not reproduced, show 
measured spectra for a test of the optical transmission system 
and photothermal ionization spectra (resolution = 0.15

  [Abstract] An optical Omega network with a four-function 
optical exchange-switch for a digital optical switching network 
is presented. The principle of the optical implementation of the 
four-function exchange-switch and Omega network via an 8-pixel 
liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (LCSLM) and special 
polarizing prisms is discussed in detail. The optical system and 
experimental results with twisted-nematic liquid crystal plates 
are given. 
  Figures 1, 3, 4, and 6, reproduced below, show an Omega 
interconnection network (P.S. = perfect shuffle, A-L are the 
twelve 2 x 2 switches), a schematic diagram of the optical Omega 
network with four-function optical exchange-switch (I and II are 
polarizing optical prisms, lines AB and CD indicate polarizing 
films, C[.sup]0[/] and C[.sub]4[/] are two of the eight 
pixels in the LCSLM, and PB[.sup]1[/] and PB[.sub]2[/] are 
prism blocks), the four states of the exchange-switch 
corresponding to the different states of the liquid-crystal 
pixels, and a schematic diagram of the optical Omega 
interconnection network with four-function optical 
exchange-switch arrays, respectively. Figures 2, 5, and 7, not

  [Text] Shenzhen -- A Shenzhen-Hong Kong programme for 
producing super-large-scale integrated chips -- the largest such 
programme in China -- announced last week the establishment of 
its Chinese-side investment company. 
  The Shenzhen Saige High-Tech Investment Co., Ltd. will 
co-operate with a large European company in producing 
super-large-scale integrated chips in the Shenzhen Special 
Economic Zone and in conducting its after-processing work in 
Hong Kong. 
  The total investment is expected to exceed 8.7 billion yuan 
or $1 billion, according to Wang Dianpu, chairman of the board 
of the Shenzhen Saige Group, the major shareholder in the 
investment company. 
  At the opening ceremony last week, Wang noted that in 1991, 
the super-large-scale integrated programme was designated a 
State-class high-tech project. 
  After two years of preparation, the chairman said, the 
company was officially established with a total registered 
capital of 280 million yuan ($32 million). 
  The company has five shareholders. Besides the Saige group, 
they are the Shenzhen Urban Construction Group, Shenzhen New 
Industry Investment Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Zhongcheng Electronics 
Engineering Co., and Shenzhen Chang Ho Industry Co., Ltd., a 
joint venture by mainland and Hong Kong parties. The Saige group 
controls 62.6 per cent of all shares. 
  Wang said the company will invite more large companies in 
Shenzhen to buy shares. 
  In the near future, Wang said, the company will emphasize 
designing, producing, packaging, and testing technology for 
super-large-scale integrated circuitry and related industries. 
  Meanwhile, by making ample use of the State's preferential 
policies for the high-tech industry, Wang said, the company will 
develop new high-tech industries and diversify its business. 
  Over the long term, Wang said, the company hopes to develop 
into a powerful multinational corporation. 
  The super-large-scale integrated programme will be built in 
phases. 
  In the first phase, the company will build an 
after-processing plant and a design centre at the Futian Bonded 
Area in Shenzhen. It will cover more than 37,000 square metres. 
  According to Wang, the company will use advanced production 
equipment and technology to design, package and test various 
kinds of integrated circuitry. 
  The first-phase project, costing nearly $100 million, is 
expected to produce 318 million integrated chips each year. Most 
will be exported. 
  The project is expected to go into operation next year. 
  ``It will be the most advanced in technology and the largest 
in scale of the country's competing manufacturers,'' Wang said. 
  He added that it would play an important role in promoting 
the country's electronics industry, narrowing the technological 
gap between China and developed countries, and pushing forward 
the industrial development in South China.

TV''] 
  [Text] Why not sharpen your TV -- eliminate ghosts and 
noise and replace them with pure bright, beautiful pictures with 
natural colours and high-fidelity sound? 
  Scientists around the world are in their final dash to 
replace the present TV sets in your home with magic boxes, 
called high-definition television (HDTV). 
  China, with most of its 800 million TV viewers still 
watching 
black-and-white, also has mapped out an ambitious plan, vowing 
to open its first experimental HDTV station by the turn of the 
century. 
  If what scientists predict comes true, this new generation 
of 
television will eliminate most of the shortcomings of the old 
set, including some things you may not have noticed. 
  As signals processed, transmitted and received are all 
digital, the loss of fidelity can be reduced to nothing 
theoretically or, at least, to an acceptable level, said Ma 
Changhua, technical adviser of the Ministry of Broadcasting, 
Film and Television. 
  The picture tube of HDTV will scan twice the number of lines 
current television can provide, so its fidelity can be as high 
as 35-millimetre film, said Ma, who is also in charge of the 
HDTV research project. 
  That means, when you stand at a distance of three times the 
screen height from the television, the picture is exactly the 
same as you can see at the real site, Ma added. 
  Therefore, the screen can be much larger than current ones. 
A 
common HDTV screen will be 32-or-36-inches. 
  It also changes the aspect ratio of the TV screen from the 
current 4:3 to 16:9, because a wide screen is much more 
comfortable on one's eyes. 
  As for your ears, the scientists have designed a so-called 
``5.1-channel sound system'' to both comfort and shock viewers. 
  There are six different multi-directional sound channels. 
  Using digital technology, the new TV will be able to avoid 
most interference in the current television from both 
inside--signals in the same and adjacent channels--and 
outside--buildings, cars or vacuums. 
  Furthermore, with some technologies, one's home computer can 
also be linked to an HDTV monitor, greatly expanding the 
functions of the computer. 
  As TIME magazine reported, it can become an ``interactive 
home information appliance'' linked by fibre optics, made easy 
to use by software and driven by powerful computer chips. 
  The future of the multimedia industry, though not 
guaranteed, 
means the HDTV system may bring virtual reality into one's 
living room. 
<H5>  China </H5>
  China's science circles are going all out to keep pace with 
the developed world on HDTV, which is advancing at a very rapid 
rate. 
  Japan is broadcasting an 8-hour HDTV programme each day 
through satellite. The U.S. is expected to open its first 
experimental HDTV station in 1996. 
  It is a must for China to develop HDTV technologies, said He 
Zuoxiu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
  ``The so-called HDTV issue is not only a matter of 
television, but also related to a wide range of other social 
questions,'' He said. 
  The technologies of digital processing, transmission, 
storage 
and display can be widely used in publications, medicine, the 
military, research, education, visual communication as well as 
other cultural and entertainment sectors, said the senior 
scientist. 
  With the great improvement in TV resolution, the movie 
industry in the future may not necessarily shoot a ``film'' with 
film, but tape, so that the cost can be greatly reduced, He said. 
  ``China must master these technologies if it does not want 
to 
always follow others in the high-tech field,'' he said. 
  He also believes that the huge future HDTV market, both 
domestic and international, promises large profits. 
  An HDTV Strategy Research Group was organized in last April 
with authoritative scientists and officials from the State 
Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences and China's top authorities in radio, film and 
television, the electronics industry, and post and 
telecommunications and the space industry. 
  According to the group's plan, now waiting for central 
government approval, China will post its HDTV system standards 
in 1997. 
  China so far has only a few computer-simulated HDTV systems 
in Ma Changhua's laboratory. These can display strikingly clear 
pictures. 
  China plans to establish a model HDTV system within two 
years. Scientists will actively prepare from now on the opening 
of the country's first experimental HDTV station around 2000, 
while developing its own HDTV industry. 
  The main task for China's HDTV development includes 
developing some key technologies and an industry to produce HDTV 
receivers, said Feng Jichun, an official with the State Science 
and Technology Commission (SSTC). 
  ``This is the highest priority,'' he stressed. 
  China expects to start commercial production of HDTV 
receivers by the turn of the century, he said. 
  The United States plans to stop broadcasting its current 
common television in 15 years. 
  The process of replacing the current television system with 
a 
high definition one will be 5 to 10 years longer in China than 
in the U.S., according to the ``most optimistic prediction'' by 
Feng Jichun. 
  This is such a sophisticated project that it needs the close 
co-operation of all concerned government departments, industrial 
circles and research institutes, Feng said. 
<H5>  Technology </H5>
  China is not capable of independently developing all the 
technologies related to HDTV, for which Japan, the European 
Community and the US have, or plan to, pour billions of dollars, 
Feng said. 
  The key HDTV technologies roughly can be classified as: 

  -  Professional equipment, including cameras and recording 
and broadcasting equipment; 
  -  16:9 wide-screen monitors and receivers, especially picture 
tubes and the chips inside; 
  -  Source encoding, compression and decoding; 
  -  Transmission systems; 
  -  Others. 

    Some technologies are still in the early research stage by 
scientists around the world. And none has so far been mastered 
by China. 
  ``We will be seeking broad international co-operation,'' 
said 
the official. 
  The technology for the signal encoding, compression and 
decoding is one of the key fields the Chinese scientists are 
studying, he added. 
  China has focused sharply on the production of home-use HDTV 
receivers for they are comparatively easy to make as well as 
highly profitable. 
  Research on HDTV picture tubes has started in some 
electronics companies through co-operation with foreign firms. 
  Some scientists also have paid great attention to the design 
and manufacture of the special chips -- the brain of digital 
HDTV.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter He Jun: ``Costs Remain Too High </F>
for China''] 
  [Text] While the world of high-definition television 
(HDTV), jointly created by the developed nations, is rapidly 
approaching, China has checked her pocketbook and doubts whether 
she can afford the technology before 2000. 
  A long debate among experts early last year concluded that 
an 
HDTV system is both affordable and profitable for China, 
especially in the economically stronger east and coastal 
regions--but not immediately. 
  Though most of China's 800 million TV viewers are still 
watching black-and-white sets, China's economic miracle in 
recent years promises that an increasing number of people will 
embrace the new technology, said Feng Jichun, an official with 
the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC). 
  Chinese family incomes are expected to increase sharply in 
the next few years. 
  Meanwhile, production costs may reduce remarkably with 
technological improvement. 
  The retail price of an HDTV receiver was 4.5 million 
Japanese 
yen ($40,500) when it first hit the market in December 1990. And 
in May 1993 it was 980,000 Japanese yen ($8,820) for a 32-inch 
receiver with built-in decoder. 
  As American scientists develop a fully digital HDTV system, 
which is more advanced than the Japanese analogue one, the 
production cost of such HDTV receivers will drop to $1,000 by 
the turn of the century, according to some predictions. 
  Though the predictions seem over-optimistic, it is sure that 
the new technology will cost less. 
  But however promising the HDTV market, the investment needed 
to conquer it is too high to be acceptable for China. 
  Japan and European Community countries have poured a total 
of 
$3.5 to $4 billion into HDTV research in the last 20 years. The 
U.S. is also expected to pour billions of dollars into 
developing its digital technology. 
  Though China has focused on just a small part of the 
technological development, the scheduled research will still 
cost hundreds of millions of yuan, excluding that for industrial 
production of HDTV receivers, said Feng. 
  As the country has much more important fields crying for 
funds, the government can hardly spare much to make the TV 
screen more attractive, Feng added. 
  ``My lab currently cannot even afford a complete set of HDTV 
hardware,'' said Ma Changhua, director of the SSTC's HDTV 
research project. 
  ``But the research must go on,'' he continued. ``If we stop, 
it will hand over a huge market to other countries and will 
cause a loss the country could hardly afford,'' he said. 
  China's national television network has 614 stations, 
covering 81.3 per cent of its nearly 1.2 billion population. 
  All the production, broadcasting and transmission equipment, 
plus the current 230 million TV sets and the TV set production 
lines, will be replaced by new ones for HDTV, he said, because 
so far HDTV is not compatible with the television now in use. 
  Theoretically, it is possible to broadcast the digital HDTV 
programmes on current TV sets, but it would produce low-quality 
pictures. HDTV receivers would perform much better, Ma said. 
  But all depends on the cost of technological development and 
the industrial production of such broadcasting facilities as 
well as the time it will take, he added. 
  With dramatic technological development in communications, 
especially in satellite broadcasting, China can hardly remain an 
isolated island of bad quality colour TV in a world of HDTV, he 
added. 
  In developed countries, industry plays the main role in HDTV 
development, but in China, both the government and the industry 
are short of cash. 
  There are also some ``chicken-and-egg'' problems for the 
promotion of HDTV, Zheng Zhihang, a researcher with the HDTV 
Research Institute of the Shanghai Jiaotong University, said at 
an HDTV seminar held last year in Beijing. 
  Consumers are unlikely to buy receivers until a wide variety 
of HDTV broadcasting is available; but broadcasters will 
hesitate to offer HDTV programmes until there are enough viewers 
to make it worthwhile. 
  Meanwhile, consumers are unlikely to buy receivers until the 
cost comes down to acceptable levels; but manufacturers can't 
bring the cost down until millions of consumers purchase HDTVs.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter He Jun: ``Nation Must Assess </F>
Situation and Choose an HDTV System''] 
  [Text] With China's growing determination to develop its 
own HDTV, the primary task ahead is to choose which hi-tech 
systems to emulate. 
  Since China is not technologically or financially capable of 
developing its own HDTV system, choosing the proper system is 
essential, said Feng Jichun of the State Science and Technology 
Commission (SSTC). 
  He said only one thing is certain now -- China's HDTV will 
be 
a fully digital system. 
  In the last 20 years, developed countries have invested a 
lot 
of time and money in HDTV research. Currently, three systems are 
under development: the analogue systems of MUSE in Japan, HD-MAC 
in Europe and the full-digital system of America. 
  Although only a few years old, the U.S. full-digital HDTV 
system is now the most advanced and the future of the HDTV world. 
  Both Japan and Europe are devoting greater efforts to 
developing their own full-digital HDTV systems. 
  But developing HDTV in China is not as simple as copying 
another HDTV system. Different conditions in China must be met 
first, said Ma Changhua, director of the HDTV research project 
of SSTC. 
  Ma is also the former director and now the technical adviser 
of the Institute of Broadcasting Science of the Ministry of 
Broadcasting, Film and Television. 
  ``It is not only a matter of adopting a set of new and 
advanced technologies for making television,'' Ma said. ``We 
must consider all kinds of technical problems as well as the 
current status of the Chinese television.'' 
  A decision has to be made whether or not the current 
production lines of Chinese TVs are to be abandoned in favour of 
the better, clearer sets from the West, Ma added. 
  The world has three colour TV systems: NTSC in U.S., Japan 
and Asia, PAL in West Europe and China, and SECAM in East Europe 
and France. 
  Because of the ``internal relations'' between HDTV and 
current television, Ma said, it is possible to use present-day 
sets while replacing the conventional TV with HDTV. 
  But if China uses a system totally different from current 
televisions, all its TV station equipment and production lines 
may become obsolete. 
  Meanwhile, Ma said, there are many technical problems. For 
example: 
  Using the PAL system for its conventional TV, China's TV 
channel bandwidth is 8 megahertz (MHz). 
  If China uses the U.S. and Japan bandwidth of 6 MHz, which 
is 
likely to be used in the U.S. full-digital television, it is 
easier for programme exchange, but more difficult to re-allot 
the existing channels. So the country plans to use 8 MHz to get 
better picture quality. 
  But the difference among future HDTV systems will be smaller 
if all the countries adopt the full-digital style, Ma said. 
  By using digital technologies, television communications 
will 
be much easier in an HDTV world. 
  ``I think the future HDTV sets can receive programmes from 
any country if a common standard is adopted,'' Ma said. 
  Though scientists dream of a world television system, the 
future HDTV is not likely to use a universal system. 
  For all the political and economic concern, the slogan ``For 
the World Peace'' that has appeared at so many international 
HDTV seminars is turning out to be wishful thinking. 
  Each country has to consider their own specific situations 
and make their own choice, Ma said.

  [Text] In accordance with the requirement of ground 
communications systems of remote distance for short-wave band, 
on the basis of the model calculation of the mean background of 
ionospheric parameters, a method is presented for calculating 
the trace of short-wave rays in the ionosphere. The work is 
mainly concentrated on two aspects. First of all, because the 
frequency of short waves is relatively higher, the magnetic and 
collision effects in refractive index are neglected, so that 
general ray equations are simplified. In the second place, a 
method of calculating the first-order partial derivative of 
ionospheric plasma parameters is presented. The calculation of 
the partial derivative is on the basis of model result of 
parameters of each ionospheric layer, that is, on the basis of 
mean background of ionospheric parameters. 
  This method can be used in HF communications system, and 
other short-wave systems such as target-position system of HF 
radar, etc.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 November (Xin Hua) -- Researchers at the 
Chinese Atomic Energy Research Institute had successfully built 
China's first radioactive nuclear secondary beam line on the 
largest domestic tandem accelerator. On 20 November, they 
succeeded in obtaining Carbon-11 and Fluorine-17 radioactive 
nuclear beams from the beam line. This achievement greatly 
expanded the scope and depth of nuclear physics research in this 
country; it also made China one of the world leaders in this 
field. 
  According to reports, researchers at the Tandem Accelerator 
National Laboratory used Boron-11 and Oxygen-16 produced by the 
accelerator to stabilize the nuclear beam, then used the newly 
constructed secondary beam line to separate, transport and focus 
the nuclear beams of different mass and energy; finally, the 
desired Carbon-11 and Fluorine-17 were obtained in the target 
chamber at the end of beam line. The test results indicate that 
the performance of this facility meets the expected performance 
indices. It is believed that currently only two or three large 
laboratories in the United States and Japan have constructed 
similar radioactive secondary facilities to carry out these 
experiments. 
  Today, the radioactive nuclear beam is an active area of 
research in nuclear physics. The knowledge base accumulated in 
nuclear physics has been built on the foundation of experimental 
research where more than 2,000 nuclides have been produced by 
bombarding a target with stable nuclear beams. But we have 
reached a point where it is very difficult to produce new 
nuclides using stable nuclear beams. Radioactive nuclear beam 
provides a possible means for producing thousands of yet 
undiscovered new nuclides; it also provides a unique opportunity 
for studying the evolution of celestial bodies, nuclear 
structures, and new phenomena and basic laws of nuclear 
reactions. As a consequence, the scope and depth of China's 
nuclear physics research will be significantly expanded. 
  This tandem accelerator has an end voltage of 13 million 
volts; it is located in the Tandem Accelerator National 
Laboratory of the Chinese Atomic Energy Research Institute. In 
the past, this accelerator has played an important role in 
China's nuclear physics research where it has been used to 
perform mass spectral analysis of beryllium-10, to simulate the 
single-particle effect in large integrated circuits, and to 
study the time of flight of abnormal fast neutrons. 
  This project is supported by the National Foundation of 
Natural Science and the Chinese Nuclear Science Foundation.

<F P=106> [Article by Ardian Myslimi: "Reform in the Military and the </F>
Honor of Zhulali Are Defended by Facts and Laws and Not by 
Servileness and Demagoguery"] 
  [Text] After defending a dissertation by attacking and 
decimating the militaristic plans of NATO and the United States, 
the author of the editorial in the 17 November 1993 issue of the 
[Ministry of Defense] newspaper USHTRIA DHE KOHA appears to be 
defending another thesis, this time by attacking newspapers and 
defending its beloved minister. Attempting to convince us that 
the mission of this newspaper is different from that of a 
supplement of RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE, he convinces us even more 
that, at the present time, the newspaper of the Ministry of 
Defense is for the personal use of [minister of defense] Zhulali 
and his staff. It has only words; it lacks logic and lacks the 
facts and laws which support its reasoning. Reform in the 
military is essential and all political forces are united in 
this opinion. But it is abnormal and antidemocratic to give the 
current government the sole credit in this area. It would be 
more realistic to concede that the need for reform was conceived 
during the time of the Nano government and the stability 
government. Indeed, during the stability government, despite the 
difficult conditions which the country and the military were 
experiencing, serious work was done to carry out reform in the 
area of laws, organization-building, regulations on exercises 
and preparedness, and living conditions, so people began to say 
that only the clocks and the officers were working in the 
country. If you condemn and criticize issues related to reform 
this does not mean that you are against reform. None of the 
newspapers attacked the need for reform but only the means, 
forms, and methods and the violations of the law. There are 
thousands and thousands of soldiers who can prove that this 
reform has been carried out on the basis of partisan criteria. 
It is a bitter reality that the appointment and dismissal of 
cadres are being carried out on the basis of authorization from 
Democratic Party cells. It is unfortunate that the current 
command and control apparatus is completely politicized. This is 
not only illegal but also very dangerous for the future of the 
military and of defense. If you claim that everything which has 
taken place in the army has been achieved during the period of 
the democratic government (that is, during the Democratic 
Party's governing), this is an extremely nihilistic and hostile 
claim. You forget, and not unintentionally, that the basic laws 
on removing the military from political and party control were 
passed during the time of the stability government and the 
technical government. There has been a lot of talk, even by the 
minister of defense, about the fact that military reform 
requires a package of laws. Where are the laws besides the law 
on ranks to which the minister added four perverse, offensive, 
and illogical articles? Where are the law on social security, 
the law on labor relations, and the decision on the 42-hour work 
week? All these are lacking because no one is interested in 
having the army being directed by these laws and in having a 
reform carried out with a full juridical platform. Experience 
and tradition are national resources in the army, just as in any 
other field. Investments have been made for them and cannot be 
lightly dismissed. It is not just a matter of economic treatment 
which leaves much to be desired in the moral sphere or of the 
melding of generations to conserve and utilize the experience 
and skills of the elders and to keep the so-called "generation 
conflict" out of the army. With such a well-thought out and 
scientific melding, the army would be stronger and the tasks 
would be carried out with fewer sacrifices. Can it be said that 
this is good for the army: almost 70 percent of the officer 
cadres who have attended Tirana University, about 65 percent of 
the cadres who have attended the Academy of the General Staff, 
hundreds of skilled specialists and technicians, and about 50 
percent of the military with scientific titles and degrees have 
left the army? New appointments have been made only by order, 
with authorization. Promotions of two or three levels have been 
made within four or five months and, what is worse, assignments 
have been given on the basis of region. We never said that the 
most inept have been left behind but the inept are in charge. 
Aren't the following data sufficient proof: about 30 percent of 
the division commanders are from Kavaje and 40 percent are from 
Diber and, with some exceptions, their level is below average. 
This practice of assignment on the basis of region, which has 
the blessing of Zhulali, has resulted in transfers for no reason 
at all, unjustified dismissals and appointments. Within a year, 
four or five division commanders have been transferred and this 
practice is continuing. Is is normal for a person who studied in 
more than two university departments and who knows four foreign 
languages to be replaced as director of intelligence by a person 
who has only military training, to satisfy the needs of the 
times? This and other appointments prove that appointments and 
dismissals have taken place on the basis of the cell system. 
Without giving exact figures, it is sufficient to mention that 
the staff which is currently directing this reform considers 
that only the cadres from Diber, Kukes, and Tropoje are the most 
trusted. The testing which takes place in the army is only a 
smokescreen to cover up and justify appointments on the basis of 
partisan criteria. Isn't it revolting that cadres with truncated 
military training are assigned to positions and youths who have 
studied at military schools, the academy, and departments of 
Tirana University, and who know foreign languages, are out on 
the streets, selling cigarettes? The Tirana garrison is 
monopolized by people from Tropoje and Diber. They are occupying 
positions while talented specialists and soldiers are out in the 
cold. A short time ago, six newly appointed young cadres in the 
Academy of the General Staff were dismissed for no reason. These 
are problems which are reflected in the entire structure of the 
army. Their results are felt by thousands of officers. However, 
the accusations of corruption which are being made against the 
minister of defense continue to be disturbing and should disturb 
the entire management apparatus of the ministry. The name of the 
minister is never mentioned alone; it is linked with the names 
of other cadres from the top military hierarchy. The task which 
the author of the article in USHTRIA DHE KOHA has taken upon 
himself is nothing but unjustified servileness. Safet Zhulali 
has never had the strength and courage to break away from his 
blind partisan position. During his entire activity with his 
staff, he has tried to organize and manage his work according to 
a blue ideology. It would have been to the credit of the 
newspaper and it would have been courageous of those servile 
newsmen not to protect corruption but to delve deeply to expose 
it, regardless of the names, colors [orientations], and 
positions the people involved might have. So far, they have not 
said anything about the accusations which have been directed 
against the minister of defense. This newspaper and its newsmen 
have not dared to say that the expenditures in the homes of 
generals currently in the Ministry of Defense are violations of 
the law. How can this be defended in light of the undeniable 
fact that $400,000 have not yet been repaid to the Ministry of 
Defense. Also, a ship with contraband cigarettes set sail for an 
unspecified destination, by order of the fleet commander. Ships 
with goods which have not passed through customs have entered 
Albanian territorial waters and the minister of defense and 
other high-ranking military officials, whom their newspaper, 
USHTRIA DHE KOHA, can only defend, have been implicated. Reform 
is defended by laws, with arguments and facts. Corruption is not 
defended by writings, by servileness, and by demagoguery. The 
truth will come out, whether or not Zhulali, his generals, and 
his servile scribblers want it. Perhaps tomorrow this reform 
will be analyzed more than it has been analyzed by a major in 
USHTRIA DHE KOHA and the responsibility and duties will be more 
extensive. Perhaps tomorrow another Blerim besides Mr. Cela will 
have the courage to examine corruption to its very core. Then 
what will be left for the servile journalists? They will 
continue their work and, if another Zhulali appears, they will 
continue to do what they have always done. They will continue to 
fanatically defend the superior who keeps them in their job.

<F P=106> [Article by Michel Moutot] </F>
  [Excerpts] Zenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Aid 
organisations are warning of chaos if UN troops are withdrawn 
from Bosnia and say they too could be forced to quit the 
country, leaving a desperate and exhausted population. 
  Dozens of aid organisations operating in the war-torn 
country 
rely on protection from United Nations troops on the ground to 
deliver supplies. 
  Even with this protection, Larry Hollingworth, who is 
responsible for all convoys organised by the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Bosnia, estimated that they 
were only meeting 20 percent of the need. 
  "We'll bring in in January, if we're lucky, about 20 percent 
of the needs. It was 17.9 percent last month and 10 the month 
before," he said. [passage omitted] 
  "If the blue helmets leave, there will be certain chaos. All 
our foreign staff will leave because there will no longer be any 
security cover. To stay without them is totally out of the 
question," said Dominique Hopital, coordinator for Handicap 
International in Zenica, central Bosnia. 
  Zenica has become the regional base for most of the 
non-governmental organisations trying to bring aid to the 
population. 
  But the organisations warn that their already difficult job 
will become virtually impossible if the UN troops leave. 
  "We can't do anything without them. The humanitarian 
(organisations) and the military are inextricably tied. Of 
course that raises certain ethical problems, but on the ground 
we have no choice," said Nathalie Lauriac also from Handicap 
International. 
  From Zenica the UNHCR controls all aid convoys to Bosnia 
either via Sarajevo airport or by the so-called Diamond route 
linking the Croatian coast with central Bosnia. 
  Hollingworth said: "I can't see the airlift surviving 
because 
it needs the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] to keep going. For 
the other kind of aid it would be possible but it would be 
difficult. 
  "If the decision were taken for UNPROFOR to leave, it may be 
possible for UNHCR to stay on its own. But without the military 
on the ground, we would certainly feel more exposed. 
  "The most important thing to remember is that there's a 
desperate need for food here. No matter who goes or who stays, 
if no one meets that need, then a lot of people are going to 
die." 
  Other aid workers also said they would have no option but to 
close down their operations in Bosnia if the UN troops pulled 
out. 
  Christophe Grange from Solidarites (Solidarity) said: "If 
everybody leaves, we won't stay." 
  Added Pierre Dorbes from Pharmaciens sans Frontieres 
(Pharmacists without borders): "We would hope to be able to 
stay if conditions allowed it, but we have not come here to be 
killed ourselves. For the moment we cannot work without 
UNPROFOR. If they leave we wouldn't last longer than three to 
four days."

<F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "Islam's Sword in the Heart of </F>
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] It is not hard to discover the reason why Alija 
Izetbegovic is so "unrelenting" toward all the Croatian peace 
initiatives and the Muslim leadership is generally self-assured 
in its attitude toward continuing the war in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. In Sarajevo, they really believe in the strength of 
the army they have created under difficult conditions. That is, 
the Muslim side has managed by great effort and in spite of 
numerous difficulties, thanks also to their own resourcefulness, 
to essentially strengthen over the last few months the main body 
of armed units in both materiel and personnel. Even as recently 
as a year ago the Muslims were fighting in shifts, because the 
total number of light weapons and infantry equipment were 
sufficient only for 10,000 soldiers, although the number of men 
ready to fight was 30,000. Today, the 3d Corps of the Army of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina (command headquarters in Zenica) alone 
has 30,000 men, officers, and noncommissioned officers. 
  The leading troops in the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
trying to penetrate the positions of the HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council] are the 7th Muslim Brigade, the 17th Krajina (refugee) 
Brigade, and the 325th Hill Brigade. In all these units, there 
are volunteers from several Islamic countries who have reached 
Bosnia and Herzegovina through various channels, mainly with 
authentic, but also forged, passports of Morocco, Algeria, 
Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Most of the Arab-Islamic 
volunteers have gone through military training in their own 
countries or have war experience, regardless of whether they 
fought in their mother countries on the side of the guerrillas, 
in the ranks of the Islamic fundamentalists, or in the forces of 
law and order and the regular army. 
<H5>  Trained and Fanatical </H5>
  What is particularly dangerous for the Croatian side in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina is the fact that these are not 
adventurers, but men trained as soldiers who are convinced to a 
fanatical extent that they are the "sword of Islam," and their 
main driving force is "holy rage." Whether they come from 
fundamentalist Muslim groups dominant at universities in Egypt 
(Cairo) and Algeria or have been recruited from the lower middle 
class and rural environments in the Arab-Muslim countries where 
there are few places for education--they are all Islamic 
militarists for whom the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a 
complete way of life. 
  These men between the ages of 20 and 45 were disappointed 
not 
only in Nasser's type of socialism (which suffered a defeat in 
Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, and to some extent Syria), but also in 
the Arab type of capitalism: the inflow of foreign capital to 
open luxury hotels and tourist resorts of the closed Western 
type, which imports "debauchery and feverish consumerism" (and 
along the way it denudes women and turns them into prostitutes), 
and creates a corrupted new domestic elite whose ideology is: 
"When you earn your first million dollars, you have your first 
rabbit, and then you cannot stop the rabbits from multiplying." 
  Given the demographic explosion which has seized Egypt, for 
example, and Palestinian Gaza (at the rate of one inhabitant per 
minute), for the poor and disenfranchised strata Islam has 
become the last refuge, exit, and chance of success: Personal 
frustrations are turned into virtues. Compensation and a defense 
mechanism have been found within the framework of the religion. 
For many extremist Islamic groups, Iran was the ideal until 
recently, and Israel and the United States were the main 
enemies. Today, their ideal is shifting to defense of Islam in 
Bosnia (Sarajevo is becoming the mute witness of "Islamic 
perseverance" abandoned by the West), and the list of enemies 
(main devils) is being extended to include the Serbs and Croats. 
<H5>  The Export of Fundamentalists </H5>
  Numerous Arab countries, aware of a possible fundamentalist 
eruption, so that Algeria and Egypt have been turned into bombs 
with a very short fuse, are trying to walk the tightrope. So, 
however opposed to Islamic fanaticism they may be officially, 
they will not have anything against simply exporting elsewhere 
all those who want to work out their frustrations and wage "holy 
war," as far from their own borders as possible and in places 
when order and law are to be found in a rifle barrel. 
  Bosnia and Herzegovina is an ideal place where an equal sign 
can be written between fanaticism, religious ecstasy, and 
bravery. And because in the parliaments and political circles of 
a majority of the Arab-Islamic countries almost everyone 
verbally supports the Muslim side and the course of Alija 
Izetbegovic, "Islamic Bosnia and Herzegovina" is becoming not 
only a strong instrument for social mobilization, but also a 
point of contact between the frightened regimes and the 
strengthened and extremely dynamic fundamentalists (who are 
making skillful use of the domestic economic problems and the 
intensified social division). 
<H5>  A Threat That Is Altogether Serious </H5>
  It can therefore be predicted that as war flares up in 
Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, the inflow of Islamic volunteers will only 
increase. The Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina will direct this 
international flood mainly toward Croatian areas of central 
Bosnia, which for the present are still offering a tough 
defense. The Islamic "jihad warriors" will bring with them new 
weapons, still more up-to-date systems for infantry warfare, 
better equipment coming from both east and west, and they will 
also be the nuclei of the leading "shock" troops, who do not 
need any special morale-building or interpretation of what they 
are fighting for. 
  The volunteers from the Arab-Islamic world, then, should be 
taken extremely seriously. Neither in Zagreb nor in Grude is 
there any room for naive reflections about the purpose of the 
imported "jihad fighters." After all, they are more than 
ordinary soldiers, and they are not conventional mercenaries. 
They did not come to Bosnia and Herzegovina because of the 
astronomical pay. They are all the product of their own 
frustrations, which might be described this way: "They envy, but 
at the same time they also hate." The violence in which they are 
taking part is for them only a favorable instrument for 
spreading their own ideas, to which they will certainly win over 
a large portion of members of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  Over the long term, they can be effectively opposed only by 
organized and trained military knowledge. In translation, this 
means that Croatian defenders should have a better survey of the 
situation, make better use of intelligence, promptly get their 
bearings in space and real time, move and reorganize their units 
astutely according to the situation, throw fresh reserves into 
combat in good time, issue orders which are comprehensible and 
not contradictory, respect the chain of command, maintain iron 
discipline in units in which commanders and officers enjoy 
inviolable authority because of their deeds, not their words. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  Principles Governing the Offensive in Central Bosnia </H5>
  The tactical principles of the Muslim offensive against 
Croatian areas in central Bosnia (to use the official military 
vocabulary of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina) are as follows: 
  1. Attack requires strict command, careful and complete 
preparation, and at the same time action by all arms within 
combat units and simultaneous action of all arms within combat 
units and with neighboring units; an understanding of the 
objectives of the operation and moral preparedness of the troops 
are a priority. At the same time, every attack offers the 
possibility of free initiative and resolute action by everyone 
down to the level of the individual soldier.... 
  2. Direct cooperation between all arms and all commanders 
from the front to the rear and from the rear to the front and 
flanks is necessary.... Only that kind of cooperation ("combined 
action") allows the superior command to take the necessary steps 
in time.... 
  3. The objective of the attack is to penetrate as deeply as 
possible into the enemy position, aiming above all at the line 
of firing positions of cannon and howitzers, which must be taken 
the first day.... The first breakthrough is relatively easy to 
achieve. The problem lies in bringing up reinforcements at the 
right time and to the right place. The enemy, surprised, must 
not regain balance. His countermeasures must be repelled with 
rapid development of the offensive. Everything depends on the 
speed of penetration achieved by the leading troops, confident 
that they will get protection of their flanks and rear and fire 
support from the rear. 
  4. There is a high risk of the offensive smothering itself. 
The critical point must be overcome through the energy of 
commanders who are out in front and thanks to the stream of 
fresh reinforcements from the rear. 
  5. The decisive factor is not the number of troops, but the 
firepower of artillery and infantry. Excessively numerous forces 
can hinder one another and complicate the problem of supply. 
Everything depends on the rapid and independent action of all 
staffs as part of a whole, and also on the ability of artillery 
and the logistic chain to keep up. 
  6. The higher the mobility of the attack, the further 
forward 
the place of the superior commands is moved, often on the 
"backs" of the leading troops.

<F P=106> [Zoran Pirolic commentary] </F>
  [Text] After several various initiatives for the recall of 
Lord Owen, the European Union peace mediator, we have now 
finally had an official one. The deputies in the European 
Parliament have demanded in the strongest terms that Lord Owen 
be withdrawn. They have also demanded that the overall European 
policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina be reassessed, as it is 
directed toward ethnic partition and the effective obliteration 
of a sovereign country. Lord Owen's reaction was predictable. 
He rejected this initiative, saying that he is only answerable 
for his policy to the Council of Ministers of the European 
Union, and not to the European Parliament. Without wishing to, 
the lord has come up with the perfect definition of the essence 
of the problem. 
  The departure of the English diplomat as the European Union 
mediator in the Bosnian crisis would not change a thing if the 
policy of the European 12 remained the same. Lord Owen is not a 
solo player but the cold and calculating implementor of an 
incorrect and absolutely unsuccessful policy. The European 
Union accepted the initiative set out by Tudjman and Milosevic 
on the ethnic carve-up of Bosnia, defining it as a peace plan, 
even though it was clear that it was only the accomplishment of 
the aims of aggression through different means, but with less 
loss of human lives and less public opinion odium. 
  French Minister Alain Juppe asked yesterday for the 
reopening 
of the Bosnian file, and used the words a new approach, which 
could mean that the approach used so far will at least be very 
seriously reassessed. 
  On the other hand, Lord Owen has been so insistent on a 
failed and practically impossible peace plan, equalizing the 
victim with the butcher, the defenders with the aggressors, that 
this should be reason enough for him to go. Cyrus Vance 
resigned when the peace plan that he devised with David Owen was 
rejected. The Brit will not do the same, even though all his 
mediating efforts have been a fiasco. It is no longer a 
question of morality -- that not being a commodity that the 
world applies to this horrible aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina 
anyway. The lord has simply lost all his credibility and it is 
time he quit this job.

  [Text] The Iranian press agency IRNA has reported that two 
mojahedin fighting against Serbian forces have died on the 
Bosnian battlefield. According to the agency, it is a question 
of two Arabs -- Habib Al Madani and Abdulah al Saleh. IRNA does 
not specify from which Arab country the two mojahedin came. 
  The news from the Iranian news agency would not draw special 
attention, considering the tragic fact that people are dying on 
the Bosnian battlefield every day. However, for the first time 
since the beginning of the Bosnian civil war, media of the 
Islamic world have admitted that mojahedin from Islamic 
countries have also been fighting on the side of the Bosnian 
Muslims. 
  IRNA also states that "a certain number of Arabs have been 
working" in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the area of the 
"humanitarian aid and education."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mladen Krsmanovic, editor of Bosnian Serb </F>
radio based in Pale] 
  [Text] Sarajevo, 26 Jan (TANJUG) -- The fact that the war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina has significant religious ingredients was 
hidden for a long time, and even when it was admitted, it was 
blamed on Serb nationalism embodied in the Orthodox faith. 
  Efforts by extremist Islamic states to sow the seeds of 
Islamic fundamentalism in southeastern Europe via militant 
organizations from the Middle East have also been ignored. Alija 
Izetbegovic's "Islamic declaration" was only the tip of the 
iceberg. 
  Programs by Muslim radio stations in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are currently full of aggressive Islam, 
Turkish words, and archaic Islamic terms alien even to 
Christians who have lived with Muslims for years. Women wearing 
Turkish trousers and veils can be seen in Sarajevo, Tuzla, 
Zenica, Travnik, and Bugojno. 
  It was not a coincidence that Islamization intensified when 
Mustafa Efendi Ceric was appointed supreme head of the Islamic 
religious community in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Since then, the political-religious-military link has formed 
a new concept of all-Muslim unity based on Islamic principles. 
  The re-education of Muslims thought to have lost their way 
has become an imperative and is designed to enlarge the Muslim 
army. The willingness to become a shahid, which is a term used 
by all Muslim media for those who give their lives for Allah in 
the holy war, is highly valued in all propaganda speeches by the 
leaders of the Islamic religious community. 
  Clerics exaggerate the significance of sacrifice for Islam 
with pathos, putting the aureola on Allah's mission while 
encouraging mass self-destruction. 
  At a debate held by Bosnian Muslim intellectuals on 22 
January, Ceric divided the Bosnian Muslims into four classes: 
Those who "can use arguments to explain why they are Muslims, 
because they study and read the Koran," are according to Ceric 
"rational-emotional-positive" Muslims. 
  "Our Muslims who have an emotional attitude to Islam" are 
emotional-positive. 
  "The third kind are the aggressive-negative Muslims, who 
have 
a complex about everything having to do with Islam or Muslims. 
They are disturbed by selam and merhaba [Muslim greetings]... 
They do not like it when I say selam to them and they reply by 
saying that that is not our language. If I were to say 
bongiorno to them they would say that it was the European way." 
  Ceric did not bother to hide his animosity toward the 
Europeanization of the Bosnian Muslims as his role is to do away 
with such misconceptions and to tame the "aggressive-negative." 
  "The fouth kind of my Bosnians are the indifferent ones and 
they do not care about selam or anything else at all because 
they do not have any attitude toward Islam and thus no 
identity," the shepherd concluded his classification of his herd. 
  Apart from those of weak faith, Ceric also targets the 
education and the schools, particularly textbooks that do not 
mention or hardly deal with the international recognition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or describe the enemies of Muslims. 
  Speaking about Islamic fundamentalism and Pan-Islamism at 
the 
debate mentioned above, Ceric said that fundamentalism was a 
large project but that "in view of our location, our numbers, 
and our ambitions, we are not linked with that project." 
  An explanation follows: "As our problem is a global and not 
a 
local one, we are also interested in the project of Islamic 
fundamentalism and we have to be aware of this as our project is 
seen as part of that fundamentalism, because Europe views Islam 
as a crime." 
  This is the way Ceric and other Islamic leaders discipline 
their people in the name of Allah, in other words, by driving 
them into slaughter-houses, into a war without an end and 
without any sense. 
  Naturally, at the same time, they are not worried whether 
Allah will forgive them for this. 
  The mechanism of coercion to do what Ceric regards to be the 
duty of every Muslim was in evidence two days ago when the 
religious leader received the commanders of the Muslim army and 
the police, Rasim Delic and Bakir Alispahic. 
  "The defense of Bosnia is equally the patriotic and the 
religious duty of every Muslim, and the Islamic religious 
community will continue to give all necessary aid in that 
struggle," Ceric said. 
  Identifying patriotism and religion and replacing humanity 
with fanaticism and warmongering is a huge and the worst 
contribution by the Islamic religious community to the suffering 
of the Muslims and others who are forced to take part in the war 
cataclysm by such an orientation of the Muslim religious, 
military, and political leadership.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with prime minister of the Srpska </F>
republic Vladimir Lukic by Dusan Vojvodic; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Vojvodic] Mr. Prime Minister, what are the 
chances for peace after the latest round of Geneva talks and 
everything that you have been discussing and negotiating on, on 
an almost daily basis, with the Muslim side in Sarajevo? 
  [Lukic] It is truly difficult to be a great optimist after 
the news from Geneva. However, I am nevertheless convinced that 
the forces in the world, and also on the Muslim side, who want 
peace will strive to put an end to this unfortunate war on these 
territories. I am deeply convinced that [Bosnia-Herzegovina 
President] Mr. Alija Izetbegovic will also realize that he is 
truly a great loser in this war and that he will be an even 
greater loser if he continues with it. 
  [Vojvodic] You have recently stated that the purpose of the 
defense of the Srpska republic is to prevent the spread of war 
from these territories. What does this mean in practice? 
  [Lukic] This in practice means bringing this war to an end 
as quickly as possible and preventing it from spreading further. 
I would really be very happy if the war confined itself to 
these territories only, because I am deeply convinced that our 
recovery tomorrow would be much faster if the war stopped where 
it is raging nowadays. Namely, a war devastates and destroys 
all assets, not to mention human lives. 
  [Vojvodic] However, in these conditions the government is 
striving for the survival of the people. Recently, you launched 
a plan to return 70,000 to 100,000 people to production. What 
does this plan involve and how to realize it? 
  [Lukic] We have many plans. One of the priorities is 
definitely the revival of the economy and the return of 70,000 
to 100,000 people into production, the return of our emigres, 
better to say, refugees, who are outside our republic, and 
finally, what is definitely very important, the strengthening of 
our front, in other words, the defense of our territory and our 
residents. 
  Beside all this we are now also working on the introduction 
of a social program to protect all the residents who have 
problems with food, accommodations, and so forth. 
  [Vojvodic] Production of food is one of the priorities, to 
my knowledge. Can it be accomplished in a shorter period of 
time, also through direct partial demobilization of soldiers who 
are currently on the front? 
  [Lukic] Yes, our last harvest was truly successfully. 
Unfortunately the sowing did not go as planned, actually, it 
under-performed significantly due to a shortage of gas. 
However, we are preparing for the spring sowing, when we would 
like to compensate for what we missed this autumn. We are 
making plans according to which the entire population would be 
engaged. Therefore, everything that is not on the front should 
work and all capable people must work. 
  [Vojvodic] And secure existence through production? 
  [Lukic] Naturally. The resources have been considerably 
exhausted in the war and we have no other choice but to strive 
for greater production. All our plans are aimed in this 
direction. 
  [Vojvodic] How much do you cooperate with Serbia and 
Montenegro, that is to say the FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia], and how do you assess their assistance in 
production and survival under the war conditions? 
  [Lukic] Well, I am taking this opportunity to sincerely 
thank all our brothers from Serbia and Montenegro, that is to 
say Yugoslavia, for all the assistance that they have offered 
us, and continue to offer, as this assistance has been truly 
outstanding, and for everything that we have endured we can 
definitely thank this assistance. Cooperation with our 
brotherly republics, that is to say our brothers from these two 
republics, is really at a high level and I can say that it is 
getting better and more successful every day. I hope that we 
will soon be one political territory.

  [Text] All three governments in Yugoslavia -- the federal 
and the two republican ones -- and the governments of the Srpska 
republic [RS] and the republic of Serbian Krajina have embraced 
the program of economic recovery and opted for a unified concept 
in Banja Luka. All conditions have been met to put the new 
dinar into circulation in these countries. This is what FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Deputy Prime Minister Jovan 
Zebic stated to our Banja Luka correspondent Branislav Bozic: 
  [Begin recording] [Zebic] The fundamental task stemming from 
the joint agreement in Banja Luka -- where representatives of 
the governments of the Srpska republic, the republic of Serbian 
Krajina, and Yugoslavia were present -- was to agree upon the 
manner in which the 1994 economic policy would be conducted, as 
well as the implementation of a new program that would involve 
the reconstruction of the monetary system and the maintenance of 
a healthy fiscal policy on an entirely new basis. The 
introduction of an economic policy to curb hyperinflation, or 
rather halt it, and, similarly to a stable dinar, facilitate 
normal conditions for work and an increase in production were 
also to be discussed. 
  [Bozovic] Can you tell us anything more concrete -- for 
example, will the new dinar be recognized in these territories? 
  [Zebic] Since all three governments in the FRY and, as I was 
informed last night, the two governments in the Serbian 
republics have accepted the program and opted for this unified 
concept, all conditions have been created to put the new dinar 
into circulation throughout the entire territory and, therefore, 
in the Serbian republics as well. 
  [Bozovic] What about payment methods? 
  [Zebic] For the time being, the payment methods are 
synchronized and maximally coordinated, and we intend to proceed 
as we have so far. There is a novelty thought here -- namely 
that payment operations will be done in old and new dinars. 
  [Bozic] Therefore, all in all, you can say that the economy 
in all the Serbian lands will function on equal conditions? 
  [Zebic] We are trying, and we believe that with this reform, 
we are safeguarding this goal -- that is, that the entire 
production in all Serbian lands functions under equal 
circumstances and that the new convertible dinar be equally 
significant for the Serbian republics and be present here as 
well. Naturally, this carries certain conditions with it -- for 
instance, it must be fully backed either in convertible currency 
or in gold. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve </F>
Croatian Army general and adviser to Croatian defense minister, 
by Mate Piskor; place and date not given: "Tuzla and Vitez Are 
Ecological Bombs"] 
  [Excerpts] Reporting from the fronts in Croatia and later 
also from those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian media on 
numerous occasions has alleged that the Serbian and the Muslim 
forces have been using chemical agents banned since 1925 by 
international convention. However, there has been very little 
credible evidence and this has been the reason why the Croatian 
Army so far has not openly reported it, stresses Professor Dr. 
Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve general of the Croatian Army and the 
defense minister's adviser for research and military-technical 
development. 
  [Piskor] General, your lecture on the application of 
chemical welfare in the clashes in the former Yugoslavia, which 
was given at Croatian Defense Ministry last week, has perplexed 
the public. Why did you present it to the public in such a 
shocking way and why only now? 
  [Binenfeld] You see, I am a scientist and I always insist 
that each claim must be supported by the appropriate evidence. 
There had been no material evidence for the use of chemical 
agents in Croatia even though there was much talk about it. We 
have the evidence now and we are presenting it to the public. 
This involves an Oganj rocket filled with the CS 
[chlorobenzamalonitride] chemical agent, which landed near 
Pokupski a year and a half ago and a hand grenade filled with 
the same chemical agent that was recently found near Zadar. 
<H5>  Shocking Information </H5>
  [Piskor] You have stated that the former Yugoslav National 
Army has approximately 100 metric tons of CS at its disposal. 
How great a danger does this represent? 
  [Binenfeld] Before I give a specific answer, I must explain 
something. I have been studying the problems of protection from 
chemical agents for 42 years. I have lectured at the Military 
Medical Academy and the Military Technical Faculty in Zagreb, I 
was an adviser to the former Yugoslav Government on the 
Disarmament Committee in Geneva, and a participant and lecturer 
at numerous international conventions on the use of and 
protection from chemical agents. Despite this, I did not know 
what the Yugoslav People's Army was manufacturing in Bijelo 
Polje near Mostar. I thought that that they were manufacturing 
quantities of chemical agents that were only sufficient for 
protection tests, but in fact they manufactured large 
quantities. General Tus, the commander of the air force of the 
former Yugoslav National Army in Mostar, was not informed 
either, and not even the omniscient CIA had any such notion. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Piskor] There is growing evidence that chemical agents are 
being used in the clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the 
Muslim forces are using it increasingly often against the 
Croats. What is your view? 
  [Binenfeld] This whole business about the use of chemical 
agents in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I consider the use of chlorine 
to be a chemical agent, started long ago with Silajdzic's 
statement that, if given no other choice, they would use 
chlorine as a weapon. He threatened to poison all Europe with 
chlorine and similar nonsense. Had he used the chlorine in 
Tuzla he would have killed his own people first, because a 
chemical agent kills unselectively, and especially pays no 
attention to ethnicity. 
  But they really do have 500 tons of chlorine in Tuzla and 
now 
comes the most dangerous bit about it. They have threatened to 
use chlorine against the Serbs and the Serbs have accused them 
of actually doing so. However, this is not certain because UN 
experts have found smoke boxes and not bombs filled with 
chlorine. However, they have used chlorine against the Croats 
several times. 
  When we started to receive the initial reports about the use 
of chlorine-filled bombs in Vitez and Busovaca, for a long time 
we would not allow this to be revealed to the public until we 
held what we considered evidence. Evidence means the name of a 
hospital, a date, the name and surname of the patient, date of 
birth, symptoms, a medical examination, therapy, and the seal 
and signature of the physician in charge. Unfortunately, there 
is plenty of such evidence published. We have not received a 
denial of a single one either from the Muslims, whom we were 
accusing, or from the UN Protection Force. [passage omitted] 
  [Piskor] Grenades filled with chemical agents are being 
manufactured in Tuzla. However, is Tuzla dangerous just because 
of this? 
  [Binenfeld] Precisely. The Sodaso factory in Tuzla is a 
real ecological bomb. I studied the Sodaso factory in autumn 
1992. Bearing in mind that I obtained information about the 
exact quantities of chemicals that they possess from the factory 
itself, I informed all the important officials in the world 
about the danger. They have all acknowledged it but nobody has 
done a thing about it. I have informed the world that the 
approximately 60 tons of mercury in Tuzla presents a danger of 
contamination spreading via the Spreca River practically all the 
way to the Black Sea. The representative of Tuzla in Zagreb has 
openly threatened to do this. Bearing in mind that, apart from 
mercury, they have more than 150 tons of a chemical similar to 
the one in Bhopal, where a tenth of the quantity caused a huge 
ecological catastrophe and killed several thousands of people, 
it becomes clear why I have said that Sodaso is a real barrel of 
gunpowder. There is also a great quantity of hydrochloric acid 
and other acids. If an explosion occurred, lethal 
concentrations of acids would emerge. It is actually difficult 
to anticipate what would happen, how many people would perish, 
how many would be injured, and what the environment would be 
like afterward. It would be a catastrophe. I have proposed that 
these chemicals be transported somewhere safe, but, naturally, 
again without any success. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Drazena Peranic: "Alija's Former Men"] </F>
  [Text] Just one newspaper in Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
recently issued a short news item that in Sarajevo Rusmir 
Mahmutcehajic, the minister for special purpose production, has 
been released from duty. If by any chance something like this 
had been happened a year ago, it would have hit the headlines of 
many newspapers with obvious surprise: Why is Alija Izetbegovic 
discharging his top man? However, just as Izetbegovic's policy 
has both formally and officially moved from the declarative 
striving for a civic state to striving for his own national 
state, so the ranks of his most prominent men have been 
diminishing and changing. 
  Following the prewar departure of the show-biz darling 
Muhamed Cengic, vice chairman of the Party of Democratic Action 
[SDA], one after another of those people have disappeared from 
the political stage: Irfan Ajanovic, SDA secretary and the 
party's first man in the former federation [of Yugoslavia] and 
the republican assembly; Omer Behmen, the grey eminence of the 
SDA and Izetbegovic's colleague from prison (both of them were 
members of the Young Muslims organization long before the war); 
Jusuf Prazina, the petty criminal who became a myth and hero of 
the Bosnian Army overnight; Armin Pohara, Izetbegovic's closest 
confident, and his personal envoy in the mission to do away with 
civic Tuzla; Sefer Halilovic, the face on the fighters' 
T-shirts, the so-called "seferovka" shirt, and formerly the 
undisputed commander of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina; Hadzo 
Efendic, reportedly the legend of the defense of Gorazde, and a 
principal actor in the Bosnian Government for many months; and 
finally, SDA ideologist Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, who left quite 
silently, or so many people believe. 
<H5>  From Singer to Tactician </H5>
  Getting rid of Cengic probably came as a great relief for 
Izetbegovic. In the broader public Cengic was a very popular 
politician (until the war he was identified with the famous 
Surrealists [a group of comedians] from Sarajevo), more and more 
frequently assisting the opposition in its attacks on the 
ineffective and nationally divided Government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose vice-chairman was Cengic himself. A 
large amount of money that this Foca entrepreneur collected from 
local Muslims for the foundation and work of the SDA still kept 
him in place as Izetbegovic's deputy until the beginning of the 
war. Thereafter Izetbegovic sent him, reportedly with the 
appropriate credentials (which later proved invalid), to 
Istanbul, appointing him representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
that country. Today, on his way from Turkey to Slovenia, Cengic 
is trying to get in touch with Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Izetbegovic, but Izetbegovic is no longer interested in that. 
Ajanovic, the last [Bosnian] delegate in the Federal Assembly 
and SDA representative in the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
former folk singer, and later one of the most radical people in 
the SDA, became the first legitimate tactician by order of the 
president, using the bar of the Zagreb hotel Panorama as his 
office for many months. Nevertheless, after Ajanovic's arrival 
in Zagreb, various logistics centers started to mushroom 
throughout Croatia, under the patronage of the powerful Zagreb 
lobby (H. Cengic, Tankovic, Sabic), in which there was no place 
for the SDA secretary, or rather there was no possibility for 
war profiteering. Thereafter Ajanovic was seen to take part in 
various panel discussions throughout Europe on the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which he fervently advocated a Muslim 
Bosnia. Nonetheless, he decided to return to Bosnia, but he was 
captured by Karadzic's men. And while part of the SDA was 
calling him a captive in the Serbian prison in Banja Luka, the 
Serbian media reported that Ajanovic had already been walking 
the streets of Belgrade for months, and quite freely at that. 
  On one occasion Izetbegovic stated that he would sacrifice 
the entire party for his former prison-mate Behman. All the 
time Behman represented a truly grand character in the party, 
having the halo of being the greatest martyr of the communist 
system. Behmen's untouchability, which emanated from his most 
severe treatment in communist penitentiaries, frequently, while 
perhaps unjustifiably, also carried the burden of the strongest 
national intolerance. Behmen became the pillar of the 
nationalistic policy of the Muslim party. At the parliamentary 
session on 14 March 1993, during the debate as to whether the 
Vance-Owen plan should be signed, Behmen stated: "We are the 
losers! We have to sign what has been offered to us. We have 
no other choice. What we must do actually reflects the 
situation on the front. The regions where we are stronger are 
ours; those where we are weaker are not ours.... The proposal 
is our fate, and it awaits us!" 
  Whether Behmen's words disturbed Izetbegovic, who was 
attempting to win several percent more territory for the Islamic 
Bosnia, both at the negotiating table and militarily, is still 
unknown; nevertheless, after that Behmen was appointed Bosnian 
ambassador to Iran. Today, Behmen is writing letters to 
Sarajevo, begging to be recalled, because he has had hardly any 
contact with either Bosnia-Herzegovina or anybody from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina! At the time when Juka [Jusuf Prazina] was a 
hero, the Sarajevo media, such as OSLOBODJENJE, were describing 
him as a fearless hero of the time, while editors were boasting 
about having the privilege of drinking coffee with Juka! Juka, 
who had been a criminal before the war, acquired the reputation 
of a Robin Hood, a protector of the poor, by stealing hundreds 
of cars, and tons of oil and food, so that the humanitarian 
donation of part of his fortune was no problem to him, while on 
the other hand it drew the media's attention to his personality. 
Encouraged by the media attention (authors were writing books 
on him, musicians were composing songs about to him), Prazina 
started to consider himself a genius, predestined to be the new 
Bosnian leader. For that reason he soon fell into disfavor 
among both the authorities and the media, so he left town, and 
on Mount Igman played a local boss, arbitrarily stopping or 
letting vehicles through from and into Sarajevo. He soon joined 
the Croatian Defense Council, and for a certain time served Mate 
Boban as an additional argument against Izetbegovic. After that 
he fled first to Germany, then to the Netherlands, Austria, and 
finally Belgium. Several days ago all the international press 
carried the news that he had been killed in Liege! 
<H5>  Leader of Mixed Marriages </H5>
  Armin Pohara entered politics in 1990, before the first 
multiparty elections, as the chairman of the tiny Party of Mixed 
Marriages from Bosanski Brod, with "brotherhood and unity" [a 
slogan from Titoist times] being as main platform, committed to 
the federation of former Yugoslavia. His party stood body and 
soul behind [former Yugoslav prime minister] Ante Markovic's 
movement of reformists, while Pohara even reproached the former 
prime minister for insufficient support for the unity of 
Yugoslavia. In the first days of the war he was actively 
involved in defense, wearing a uniform of the Defense Command of 
Bosanski Brod, which soon silently surrendered to Karadzic's 
army without a fight. The sudden recollection of his Muslim 
origins made the leader of Mixed Marriages offer his services to 
Izetbegovic, who promoted Pohara to coordinator of the Armed 
Forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and his special envoy in the 
operation "Eliminating Red Tuzla." Since the citizens soon 
banished the envoy from Tuzla, and in the meantime the 
Croat-Muslim conflict had broken out, this political chameleon 
ran away to seek protection under Boban's wing, looking for his 
chance in the politics of a Croat-Muslim Party. Today, this 
anonymous pre- war journalist is finally accomplishing his dream 
-- he is the chairman of a party, editor in chief of an 
independent newspaper, ZAPADNA BOSNA [WEST BOSNIA], writing 
editorials and aspiring to be a new Geneva negotiator. 
  A captain in the former Yugoslav People's Army, Sefer 
Halilovic entered the Bosnian political stage quite grandly, 
obsessed with his mission to defend the integral 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Originally from Sandzak, the captain 
rejected the introduction of ranks in the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, justifying that with the slogan "we shall 
all prove ourselves in fighting," which provoked a reaction 
among the more experienced and qualified army officers. Given 
the needed media attention, Halilovic more frequently behaved 
like a politician than as a soldier, and thus soon raised the 
question in the foreign media as to who the real authority in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was -- Izetbegovic or Halilovic. The 
abandonment of the idea of an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina, as 
well as the negotiations for additional percentages of the 
territory for the so-called Bosnian state, forced Izetbegovic to 
suspend Halilovic and replace him with Rasim Delic, who is a 
professional soldier and quite disinclined toward politics. At 
the beginning the official explanation was that the shift 
reflected Halilovic's reappointment to some other post, rather 
than suspension, but now the information is much more exact -- 
Halilovic is under house arrest. 

<H5>    Loyal Personnel </H5>
  Hadzo Efendic is a man of rather moderate intellectual 
abilities, but for that reason extremely loyal to Izetbegovic, 
whom the SDA, while the discredited leaders were in charge, 
suddenly launched as a promising new party man. The SDA created 
a new image for Efendic as the man who defended Gorazde. 
However, this Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia, having been 
declared a UN protection zone, is today a synonym for the 
suffering of Bosnian Muslims. Having been appointed deputy 
prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the absence of [prime 
minister] Mile Akmadzic, Efendic was considered to be the 
government's strongest man, although his utmost level of action 
is the repetition of hackneyed phrases about the Bosnian 
peoples' unity, so long as Izetbegovic supports the concept of 
integral Bosnia under his authority. Today, when a miniature 
Muslim state is being publicly advocated, Efendic has been 
removed from Sarajevo, and following the proven method, sent to 
Vienna. 
  The latest silent removal of one of the leading SDA people, 
Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, is still the most indicative example of 
Izetbegovic's policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the times of 
peace, when Izetbegovic did not even think about publicly 
advocating his Muslim state, Mahmutcehajic was considered to be 
a radical nationalist in SDA. Today, when Izetbegovic is 
finalizing his Islamic political options, Mahmutcehajic is a 
persona non grata for such a job. His removal proves that 
Izetbegovic's goal -- a Muslim Bosnia -- has long outgrown 
Mahmutcehajic's nationalism. These days the former SDA 
ideologist is in a way protected by the intellectuals of 
Sarajevo, because in comparison with others, his politics are 
regarded as quite moderate. 
  The struggle for as close a position to Izetbegovic as 
possible is now going on between Ejup Ganic and Haris Silajdzic. 
In the last couple of months Silajdzic has won a considerable 
advantage over Ganic, and he is more and more frequently seen in 
Izetbegovic's company during state visits of increasing 
importance. Nevertheless, Ganic, as a constant political 
claimant to a more important position in the administration, 
will hardly allow Silajdzic to get too far ahead. Be it as it 
may, the struggle of various of Izetbegovic's aides for the 
second most powerful position in the administration again 
confirms the same thing: Izetbegovic's undisputed dominance on 
the throne of the Bosnian Islam.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Mijic: "The Seed Is Planted, Missionaries </F>
Arrive"] 
  [Excerpts] The new 1993/94 academic year has started in the 
schools of the Zvornik-Tuzla eparchy with renewed joy among the 
students. The curriculum was enriched by much desired religious 
education, banished from schools almost 50 years ago. The 
awakened Serbian people, waging a war for national freedom, have 
also started to wage the battle for spiritual awakening, return 
to the Orthodox religion, and life worthy of their ancestors. 
These ancestors lived and survived in the Bosnian dark melting 
pot thanks to their Orthodox faith. 
  The government and the assembly of the republic of Srpska, 
aware of the significance and role of religion for Serbs, passed 
the law on introducing religion in schools on the territory of 
the republic. 
  Based on the decrees of the constitution of the Serbian 
Orthodox Church, the decision of the ministry of education, 
science, and culture of the republic of Srpska, the draft law on 
primary and secondary schools in the republic of Srpska, and the 
demonstrated needs in the area, the Zvornik-Tuzla bishop, G.G. 
Vasilije, appointed 102 religious teachers in 259 elementary 
schools in his eparchy on 30 August 1993. [passage omitted] 
  The believers of the Zvornik-Tuzla eparchy, aware that a 
people which fights for its freedom can never be conquered, 
welcomed the teachers of the greatest area of knowledge -- 
religion -- and are ecstatic about the return of the Church and 
Orthodoxy. 
  The instruction will be carried out according to the 
educational program adopted in accordance with general 
regulations of the curriculum in the elementary schools of the 
republic of Srpska. The seed has been planted in the Lord's 
field, and the missionaries have arrived.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Ivanov, Bulgarian President Zhelev's </F>
adviser on ethnic questions, by Valeriya Vaseva; place and date 
not given: "I Have Never Questioned the Bulgarian Origins of 
Muslims in the Western Rhodope Area"] 
  [Text] Mikhail Ivanov is President Zhelev's adviser 
on ethnic questions. He became notorious recently with his 
"discovery" of Wallachian and Pomak ethnic minorities in our 
country and his claims of 7,000 Macedonians allegedly living in 
Bulgaria. Mr. Ivanov is a nuclear physicist by profession. 
  [Vaseva] Mr. Ivanov, ethnic tensions have been recently 
fanned in our country, while our public is sensitively reacting 
to alien interferences in our domestic affairs. Do you believe 
that the state institutions are defending our national interests 
with the ncesssary firm resolve? 
  [Ivanov] I share de Gaulle's concept that the egocentrism of 
the nation should be the prevailing characteristic feature of a 
country's behavior. In this respect we should pursue our 
egocentric, Bulgarian interests. However, I would like to point 
out, in this connection, that I ardently support the concept of 
a "nation" in the political sense, namely as it was introduced 
by the French philosophers in the 18th century. According to 
this concept, a nation is a community of people rallied by the 
idea of a common state. Once the state as such has been 
established, the idea is to preserve and develop it as an 
entity. In this respect, Bulgaria is a single-national state, 
where ethnic, religious, and linguistic varieties exist. Hence, 
the Bulgarian national idea should be to join all efforts for 
the sake of Bulgaria's prosperity, while preserving the 
aforementioned variety. You are asking whether we are 
sufficiently defending our interests? We should never be 
satisfied with our achievements, but I am convinced that 
decisive steps forward have been accomplished in connection with 
the protection of Bulgarian interests. Reasons for justified 
criticism exist, but many things have improved. 
  [Vaseva] Do cases of human rights' violations against Turks 
or Bulgarian Muslims exist, according to you? 
  [Ivanov] Certain conditions are required for implementing a 
right. Let us take the question of the mother tongue, for 
example. The Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] insists on 
introducing the Turkish language as obligatory and claims that 
human rights have been violated in this connection. I do not 
agree. I think that one cannot force the children of people who 
have declared themselves as Turks to learn the Turkish language. 
The international convention against discrimination in the 
educational sphere stipulates that such studies should be 
voluntary. However, in this respect, we should ask the question 
-- have the necessary conditions for an effective language 
training been provided for? No, they have not been provided 
for. The number of teachers is insufficient and their level of 
qualification is not adequate.... Perhaps, the training 
programs should be revised and more organically integrated with 
the educational process as a whole. This is the stand of the 
National Education Ministry, which I subscribe to. 
  [Vaseva] Are you convinced that the Bulgarian state is 
capable of effectively opposing the Turkification process in the 
Rhodope area? 
  [Ivanov] Only two of your young colleagues have noticed that 
I am discerning between forced Turkification and Turkish 
self-identity, but no one really understood it. 
  I have never questioned the Bulgarian origins of the Muslims 
in the Western Rhodope area and have never denied that their 
mother tongue is Bulgarian. I am simply defending the right of 
ethnic self-identification. It is true that some of those 
compatriots have identified themselves as Turks. However, this 
is the result of very complicated causes, which should be 
carefully analyzed. 
  [Vaseva] Nevertheless, you do not deny that the Bulgarian 
Muslims are subject to forced Turkification? 
  [Ivanov] We are touching upon an ambiguity in this case, 
namely, we must distinguish between coercion and influence, and 
establish whose influence we are talking about? The Muslims of 
the Western Rhodope area did not identify themselves as Turks 
either on 18 November or on 10 December 1989, and they did not 
do so during their protest vigil on the eve of 29 December 1989. 
On that occasion they demanded the restoration of their names, 
by administrative, rather than by law court procedure. 
  The law court procedure was adopted as a result of a deal 
with the participation of Petur Mladenov, Andrey Lukanov, and 
Stanko Todorov, on one side, and Dimitur Arnaudov, Branko 
Davidov, and Ahmed Dogan, on the other side. 
  It happened on the eve of passing the Names Act, on 5 March 
1990, and it greatly contributed to the ethnic mobilization of 
the Muslims in the Western Rhodope area in the direction of 
their ethnic Turkish self-identification. 
  The anti-Turkish demonstration organized by the All-National 
Committee for the Defense of National Interests [OKZNI] in 
January 1990 also exerted a highly negative effect. I remember 
that numerous women from the Rhodope area called on me to 
complain, at that time, and I remember their tears. The 
subsequent, violent opposition to the introduction of the 
Turkish language as the mother tongue also played a decisive 
role. 
  The DPS organized a school boycott in which the Muslims 
from the Western Rhodope area were also involved, while the DPS 
leaders assumed the political responsibility for the boycott. 
If you add the fact that the economic situation in the area has 
become disastrous, under the circumstances, and if you realize 
that the souls of those people have been troubled for so many 
decades, you should understand that they are looking for some 
spiritual values to rely upon. Considering the habit of 
frequently referring to "them, the Pomaks" as being different 
from "us, the Bulgarians," it is easy to perceive the tragedy of 
people in that region. 
  [Vaseva] Why should we not declare at the highest level that 
the "Rhodope area is Bulgarian," which would put an end to all 
attempts and speculations? 
  [Ivanov] Actually, President Zhelev said so in his address 
to the nation following the 13 October 1991 elections. 
  [Vaseva] Nevertheless, Mr. Dogan dared to declare that even 
the president cannot prevent him from conquering the Rhodope 
area and proclaimed this region as a zone of influence belonging 
to the DPS! 
  [Ivanov] I am actually highly disturbed by the last DPS 
conference. The manner in which it was conducted, Ahmed Dogan's 
address, and the statute that was adopted could be cited in a 
text book as typical examples of authoritarian behavior. I think 
that when formal conditions are created for a political party to 
entirely identify itself with its leader and when this party 
identifies itself as speaking on behalf of a large, compact 
group, this is not in the interests of Bulgarian democracy. 
  [Vaseva] Why did Professor Nikolay Genchev call you "an evil 
personality" and a "traitor of national interests"? 
  [Ivanov] You should better ask Prof. Genchev himself. I 
would not like to start a polemic with him on such level. We 
have serious differences of principle and I am ready to discuss 
them with him in a public debate. I will tell you, to begin 
with, that I recently attended a seminar, near Burgas, where 
Prof. Genchev was also present and at which he expressed his 
views on the solution of ethnic relations in our country. 
According to him, the Bulgarian Turks should be encouraged to 
immigrate to Turkey, or be dispersed throughout the country, 
while Bessarabian Bulgarians should be resettled in the 
abandoned areas. I am convinced that, in talking about 
Bulgarian national interests, ideas such as those expressed by 
Prof. Genchev do not make any sense. 
  [Vaseva] You are a nuclear physicist by profession. Do you 
regard yourself as sufficiently competent to advise the 
president on ethnic problems? 
  [Ivanov] I am a specialist in the field of theoretical and 
mathematical physics. My original profession has taught me to 
think, above all. The rest is a question of knowledge that can 
be acquired by reading. The problems we are talking about 
require an interdisciplinary approach. 
  Let the historians not be jealous. They are not the only 
ones 
entitled to determine how to solve ethnic problems. I highly 
appreciate the contribution of economists, sociologists, 
lawyers, political scientists, ethnologists, and so forth. I am 
trying to coordinate the efforts of all specialists and to learn 
from them. Nevertheless, I have the feeling of being 
sufficiently competent for my job.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Evgeni Gavrilov: "Cabinet Sets New Record in </F>
Governing"] 
  [Text] On 30 December Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and his 
ministers festively marked the first anniversary of their tenure 
at the head of the executive. This is noteworthy because no 
other government since 10 November 1989 could match this 
achievement. 
  Foe a whole year the government based itself on a "dynamic 
parliamentary majority." Indeed, this was the government's 
foundation. In the final analysis the cabinet's longevity was a 
result of Lyuben Berov's ability to balance interests, which at 
first glance seem to be contradictory. This is because the 
interests of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], the Movement 
for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], and the Union of Democratic 
Forces [SDS] are rather different. This resulted in certain 
incomplete decisions that disturbed rather than furthered reform. 
  The cabinet, which survived four no-confidence votes, had 
succeeded in strengthening its positions only by the end of the 
year. It was then that its two major successes came -- the deal 
with the bank-creditors on remitting 50 percent of Bulgaria's 
foreign debt, and signing a provisional trade agreement with the 
European Union. Other governments also contributed to those 
successes, but it was Berov's government that reaped the rewards. 
  However, the successes were preceded by the three great 
failures of Berov's team -- privatization, land reform, and the 
budget. In his program speech, precisely one year ago, the 
prime minister announced that his team would be the government 
of privatization. The lack of privatization deals was replaced 
by actions that in the past belonged to the category of 
organized enterprises. In January the government adopted a 
decision to prepare a long-range privatization program by the 
end of May. The program has still not been carried out. In 
February a group of experts led by Emil Khursev, deputy chairman 
of the Bulgarian National Bank, submitted a proposal to the 
Council of Ministers on the participation of the banks in 
privatization. At a special meeting in March the government 
adopted a number of decisions related to accelerating 
privatization, but they remained only on paper. In May there was 
an inadequately considered proposal by Berov on accelerating 
mass privatization through promissory notes. Deputy Prime 
Minister Valentin Karabashev did not like the proposal. Two 
months later he proposed a draft mass privatization program 
through investment funds. This time Berov disagreed with the 
proposal. Finally, in August the Berov-Karabashev hybrid 
proposal was accepted. Prior to this it had been rejected by 
everyone, but, nevertheless, it was adopted without any debate 
at a government meeting. 
  In November the professor told REUTER that he was 
contemplating the establishment of a ministry of privatization. 
In December the government admitted that the greatest 
privatization deal -- the one with the "Balkan" Air Company -- 
had fallen through. Throughout this entire period the 
government four times dismissed the members of the Privatization 
Agency Supervisory Board, appointed on a quota of the government 
basis, but the Supreme Court restored their membership. 
  The words of the minister of agriculture that in 1993 land 
will be returned to its owners still hang in the air.

<F P=106> [Article by Captain (Second Rank) Vasil Danov and Major </F>
(Eng.) Iliycho Iliev of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion: 
"How Did You Sin, Officer? In the Past and Now the Armed 
Defender of Bulgaria Continues To Be Economically Enslaved, 
Politically Deprived of Rights, Socially Degraded, and Morally 
Crippled"] 
  [Text] Who was the officer in 1989? For a very large part 
of the population, he was the uniformed novice, a prop of the 
totalitarian regime, a submissive executor of absurd commands 
and decisions of the semi-illiterate superior leaders, who were 
sometimes shepherds, tailors, and cobblers, quickly graduated 
from the ShZO [Reserve Officers School], or from three- or 
six-month courses for officers. 
  Exploiting the halo created above the head of the officer 
throughout history, the totalitarian machine employed hirelings 
who were to embody and support the mechanism of its power. For 
this bargain, it paid them a little more than the average 
salary, maintaining the myth in the society at large that the 
officer is a privileged person, that he is part of the nation's 
economic and political elite. 
  For the recalcitrant, there were political sections and 
party 
commissions, military counterintelligence, and State Security. 
There was also the "freedom" to leave the military with a wolf's 
ticket [an undesirable discharge] given to those disciplinarily 
dismissed for political reasons, or for "unreliability" and to 
be doomed to misery and moral harassment along with his family. 
  For two or three decades of loyal service to the nation and 
the fatherland, the officers received the indulgence of buying 
one panelboard apartment (after age 45), of living in 
humiliating anticipation of a paltry pension, to be looked at 
with disparagement, and to endure spiritual judgment under 
socialism, before smiling at death. 
  Called in the name of the most shining ideals, the officer 
was economically enslaved, politically deprived of rights, 
socially degraded, and morally crippled. 
<H5>  Today We Draw the "Dividends" From This Inheritance </H5>
  Of the 500 officers released this year [1993], almost 80 
percent of them have no right to a pension. These are the young 
officers who preferred to drive taxis, to lay tiles, or to 
become painters instead of waiting for inadequate salaries, 
which are sometimes delayed. 
<H3>  Unemployment Among Officers' Wives Is Disproportionately 
High; 65-70 Percent Do Not Work </H3>
  These women are among the first to fall victim to layoffs 
since "the husband is an officer." 
  The meager military budget does not allow for periodic 
issuing of uniforms. There are not sufficient means for 
repairing garrison buildings, for feeding personnel, and for 
basic human needs, let alone for full military preparedness. The 
army owes hundreds of millions of levs to state and private 
companies, which are already refusing to supply us with even the 
most essential goods. In the press, cases have been described in 
which officers have used their own funds to feed their troops. 
In a number of outfits, it has become a tradition to give passes 
for Saturday and Sunday to almost all the soldiers because it is 
impossible to feed them in the mess halls. 
  The paltry social funds which the army has today do not 
permit housing to be built and condemn young officers to remain 
homeless for many years. 
  For that reason, during the coming years in some military 
schools, it will reach such a point that 0.66 percent of young 
people will apply for admission. Thus, anyone who is willing and 
can read and write will be admitted. 
  Legally, the officer continues to be in a much more 
disadvantageous position than civilians. Deprived of the right 
to participate in political life, we are denied representation 
in parliament and are without even the most modest lobby with 
the deputies. 
  Two parliaments and three governments have delayed the Law 
on 
Defense and the Armed Forces (ZOVS), the package of laws on the 
MVR [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the law on pensions, state 
employees, and so forth. And that is no accident. The interests 
of not a single one of the parliamentary political forces 
coincide with the nation's need for a strong military and 
police. The solidarity of an officer corps possessing good 
morale would raise a cry against the corruption, lawlessness, 
and passivity of the institutions and those in power. It would 
be asked why the criminals who are ruining the army and driving 
the country to yet another national catastrophe are not being 
brought to justice. 
<H5>  In the Puppet Show, the Fate of Bulgaria Is Being Trifled... </H5>
  ...but the episode, "Creation of a Stable Army, Police, and 
Specialized Service," is missing. 
  Officers who are highly qualified and concerned about their 
futures, led by charming generals, did not permit people with 
dubious (agent [state security informer]) antecedents or with 
current legal entanglements to lecture to us from parliamentary 
microphones about what is national security, military doctrine, 
the armed forces, and military reform. As if no one knew that 11 
billion dollars and eight levs (in 1992 prices) would be 
required for the reform. 
  At the same time, the gentlemen-populists are ready to vote 
to limit the period of active military service by three or more 
months. They are ready to obstruct the army just to let graft 
operate for themselves. What else could a person think, after a 
group of deputies presented a motion to adjourn a parliamentary 
meeting at which the disasterous financial condition of the army 
would be examined and the defense minister and the chief of the 
general staff would be heard? But this motion was dismissed 
because there were no more urgent problems than those of the 
military. 
  The current plight of the military servicemen is the result 
of a staged ineptitude and of a deliberate attempt to reduce the 
defensive capabilities of the nation, in order to have that 
posttotalitarian model adopted, a model determined by the 
puppeteers. That is why our defense industry has also been 
wrecked; we have lost longstanding arms markets into which 
companies from "brotherly" states have quickly stepped. 
  For this reason, we continue to be mired, without rights, 
still doomed by the Law on General Military Service of 1958 and 
by the statutes and regulations copied from the former USSR's 
statutes on the armed forces by neo-Stalinists. The Regulations 
on the Acceptance of Officers for Active Military Duty, which is 
still in effect (and still secret), contains numerous flagrant 
violations of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the 
Constitution, and of recently passed laws. The obsolete 
normative order ties the hands of the just, hardworking 
commanders who are willing to take the initiative and creates 
excellent conditions for schemers, string-pullers, and 
opportunists to exercise selective leadership methods. 
<H3>  Society Has the Kind of Military That It Deserves, That It 
Creates for Itself </H3>
  At times, ill-fed and reduced to rags, our army has been 
invincible because among the people there has seethed a volcano 
of vital patriotic enthusiasm. Today, their faith shaken and 
deeply rent by division, we can hardly expect that we will soon 
again have the reviving luster from that generation of officers 
who have written the most glorious pages of our recent history. 
They did not lose a single battle or a single operation in the 
Serbo-Bulgarian War, the first Balkan War, the second Balkan 
War, World War I, or World War II, but, as a result of the 
shortsighted policies of their "leaders," they have been 
relegated to the camp of the vanquished. 
  After 10 November 1989, the defense bureaucracy opened its 
doors to hundreds of civilian specialists. But with the 
exception of indisputable professionals, along with the three 
civilian defense ministers, there have come not just a few prima 
donnas, men who left their country to work abroad, and 
intriguers, who have robbed the military materially and morally, 
deepening its contradictions, and going all over the world, 
leaving the problems to the next batch of experimenters. We 
believe that it is impermissible for officers and sargeants to 
wait 10-15 years for military housing while civilians receive a 
key to the military housing stock with their appointment papers 
just because they are on someone's team. After months, the team 
left the MO [Ministry of Defense], but they kept the housing 
they acquired, those forever happy former servicemen. 
  Lacking a national security concept, official ratification 
of 
the Bulgarian military doctrine, and laws, our army has been on 
autopilot for four years, and the officer corps has wandered 
about in a professional, legal, and moral wilderness. Taking 
turns, the almost seasonal management team in the MO comes in. 
With the understanding that they are short-timers, they work in 
piecemeal fashion, without even trying to set forth the 
principles of a modern, stable military. 
  Under these circumstances, those who thrive are generals, 
senior commanders, and the leading pawns from the Dzhurov 
[Minister of Defense Dobri Dzhurov 1962-90] era, the embryos of 
the neophytes, suckers from a more energetic plant, pretenders 
to the former military glory. Today, already as depoliticized 
leaders, they graduate discretely from language courses, receive 
specialized training at U.S., French, and German academies, lead 
newly established administrations and departments, profit from 
rigged competitions, and deliver testimonials about their common 
colleagues. 
  After the defeat in Vietnam, the prestige of the U.S. armed 
forces fell abruptly. This was followed by an unsparing analysis 
of the reasons for the ignominious defeat. Legal, structural, 
and financial measures were taken. In a few years, the 
government and the society at large restored the ranking of the 
Army, Air Force, and Navy to first place in the sociological 
ratings, next to the Supreme Court, and ahead of the president, 
television stars, and sports heroes. But to achieve this, 
intellectual courage and determination were necessary; these 
qualities were displayed by the leadership of the armed forces. 
  This same intellectual courage is needed in Bulgaria.

  [Text] Cultural clubs of Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina 
have issued a public protest in which they request that the 
Croatian Government close all the diplomatic and foreign 
representations of Alija Izetbegovic in the Republic of Croatia. 
They state as the reason for this request the fact that they 
have proof that these representations have been spreading lies 
about the entire Croatian people and organizing the delivery of 
equipment and mercenaries, as well as espionage, for the benefit 
of Muslim forces which are fighting against the Croatian people 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They claim that they have the following 
documents as proof of such activities: Muslim passports with 
falsified data, video shots of the training of Muslims in 
Slovenia, video shots of anti-Croatian speeches by current 
Reis-ul-Ulema Ceric at the Zagreb mosque, video shots of the 
recruitment of mojahedin among Turks and Arabs in Germany, 
photographs of mojahedin who arrived in Bosnia via Zagreb, video 
shots showing a UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] officer giving 
permission to a Muslim unit to carry out an attack, video shots 
of Muslim criminals of the `Crni Labudovi' [Black Swans] unit, 
and so forth. It is stated in the protest that data will 
continue to be gathered and that there are people in the 
Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Defense 
who are concealing these facts for money.

<F P=106> [Article by Filip Svarm: "Milan Babic--A Career"] </F>
  [Text] Milan Babic was born in 1956 in the village of 
Kukari, near Vrlika. He studied dentistry in Belgrade, where he 
achieved notable success as a youth functionary. Upon receiving 
his diploma, he got a job at the Knin Health Center, but 
completed his specialization in Sarajevo. To the people of Knin, 
however, Babic is much less known as a dentist--there is a 
witness (the name and address are known to the editors) who 
alleges that Babic accidentally pulled one of his healthy 
teeth--than as a politician; among other things, he was the 
party secretary at his health center. He witnessed the 
disintegration of the LCY [League of Communists of Yugoslavia] 
as an LCC [League of Communists of Croatia] delegate at its 
last, 14th congress. Behind the scenes, he opposed Ivica Racan 
and part of the Croatian delegation, failing to comprehend what 
they had against Slobodan Milosevic and why they were supporting 
the Slovenes. He returned to Knin, definitively breaking with 
the reform faction of the Croatian communists and launching his 
career as a national politician. 
  Under the supervision of Dr. Jovan Raskovic, Babic quickly 
became one of the founders of the SDS [Serbian Democratic 
Party]. He ran for the post of president of Knin Opstina in the 
first multiparty elections in Croatia in 1990 and was elected. 
However, he was not satisfied with the results of the elections; 
the SDS won in only three of the total of 11 Serb opstinas in 
Croatia. In this way, Raskovic was forced to negotiate with 
high-ranking Croatian functionaries (it appeared to be a matter 
of days before he would be officially declared the new Svetozar 
Pribicevic), and Babic himself conducted some of the 
negotiations, especially with the ministers in the Croatian 
Government in charge of the economy. He sought the combination 
of the northern Dalmatian and Lika opstinas into one community 
that would be better able to develop. The Croatian side, 
however, wanting to be done with the communists once and for 
all, allowed the SDS to repeat the elections in an 
"antibureaucratic" manner--Zagreb figured that this would 
satisfy Raskovic, and that he would support them in the 
inevitable conflict with Milosevic. Throughout the summer of 
1990, Krajina teemed with various SDS rallies. Besides Raskovic, 
Babic was an obligatory speaker. While the former spoke about 
the Serb soul, the latter dealt with the Serb stomach; while the 
party chairman met with priests, the president of Knin Opstina 
set up the party apparatus; while the psychiatrist attended 
village feast celebrations, the dentist spent endless hours at 
meetings of activists. Along the way, Babic the pragmatist 
accumulated various executive functions. At the end of the 
summer of 1990, the bills finally came due: Dr. Tudjman asked 
Raskovic to take a definitive stance toward Serbia. The latter 
was unable to do so, in part because of his personal ties with 
the SANU [Serbian Academy of Science and Art] and Francuska 
Street 7, in part because of pressure coming from within his own 
party. At their last meeting, Raskovic explained to Tudjman why 
he should not strain relations with Serbs in Croatia too much, 
providing the legendary explanation: "The Serbs are an insane 
nation." Then he made two mistakes: He did not inform the SDS 
leadership of what happened at the meeting, and he left for the 
United States. The notes from the meeting published by DANAS in 
Zagreb spelled the end of his political career. Babic pointed 
out to his fellow fighters, there you have it, Uncle Jovan is 
good and intelligent, but he is frivolous and naive, and in his 
absence Babic took over the party. The situation was also more 
than advantageous for him: Public debate was in full swing 
concerning amendments to the Croatian Constitution, i.e., the 
introduction of new symbols (the odious "checkerboard" flag) and 
the elimination of the Serbs as a constituent nation, as that 
would be characterized today. 
  In any event, the barricades appeared on 17 August as a Serb 
reaction to the Croat reaction that the announced referendum on 
autonomy for Krajina would be prevented "by all means." It 
seemed that everyone in the crowd that emerged was confused--the 
Croat policemen sent to remove the barricades, the Serbs at the 
barricades, the tourists forced to take detours, Dr. Raskovic, 
and Dr. Tudjman--everyone except Milan Babic. In his capacity as 
president of the opstina, he declared a state of war on Radio 
Knin, reported attacks by "Tudjman's special forces," said that 
he had proof that chemical warfare was being waged, and 
instructed the population to save ammunition after the victory 
by the "Red Star" because it would soon be very necessary. All 
authority in Knin was his now. There were no more serious 
negotiations with Croatia. Everyone who attempted to negotiate, 
such as Veljko Dzakula, or the former Assembly deputy Radoslav 
Tanjga, received Babic's anathema. It was obvious that the 
president of the SAO [Serb Autonomous Region of] Krajina was 
doing little at his own initiative; after the 9 March 1991 
demonstration in Belgrade, he sent Slobodan Milosevic a letter 
of support and demanded a settling of scores with "the 
Draskovicites and students" for the sake of Serb unity. 
  Many regard Plitvice Easter, 1 April 1991, as the beginning 
of the war in Croatia. The day before, Babic declared 
unification with Serbia in Korenica, taking the Serbian 
parliament completely by surprise and showing that dealing with 
him would not exactly be an easy thing. The open warfare that 
subsequently broke out put many things on the back burner, until 
it was "frozen"--by the signing of the Vance plan. In the 
meantime, Babic had advanced to the post of president of the RSK 
[Republic of Serbian Krajina], and as such he was the sole 
master of Krajina. He figured that trade with his state was 
secure, and to the surprise of everyone, he refused to sign the 
plan. He was assailed for hours at a meeting of the SFRY 
Presidency, but he refused to budge. Finally, Slobodan Milosevic 
was forced to write an open letter calling for his dismissal. 
The people of Knin remained faithful to their opstina president 
("Slobodan, write another letter, we did not understand the 
first one"), but executors of the deed were found in the persons 
of Goran Hadzic and Mile Paspalj. Babic was replaced, and his 
political fate seemed sealed. 
  Babic, treated as a potential rebel, spent the period 
following his dismissal criticizing the new Krajina leadership 
and the Vance plan. He let it be known that he had no intention 
of retreating and that he was prepared to wait. On two occasions 
he was mistreated: Under unclarified circumstances, in March 
1992, officer Zdravko Vranjes fired his gun at his apartment, 
and in July of the same year a group of unknown policemen beat 
him up in Benkovac and held a pistol in his mouth. Nevertheless, 
after a ritual reconciliation with Martic in October 1992 (they 
had fallen out over the Vance plan), things began to look up for 
Babic. It also turned out that he had evolved and mastered the 
political vocation. He is cold-blooded, does not expose himself 
in Krajina political showdowns, and in general he uses 
others--the local radicals, for example--to skillfully advance 
his aims. He is patiently building a party with numerous people 
who are dissatisfied with the Hadzic team, which is no problem 
whatsoever under the conditions of everyday life in Krajina. 
They say that he has changed quite a lot in waiting for his five 
minutes, but that in one regard he has remained consistent: He 
will never go back to Croatia, no matter what the price.

<F P=106> [Interview with Damir Begovic, general director of the </F>
Croatian Electric Power Industry, by Branka Oreb-Jerkovic: Is 
Krsko Slovenian? Yes, if They Pay Us One Billion Dollars!"] 
  [Excerpts] [Oreb-Jerkovic] The Slovene press is full of 
accusations against the Croatian Electric Power Industry [HEP] 
for nonpayment of debts to the Krsko Nuclear Power Plant for 
electric energy that has been delivered. Mr. Begovic, in your 
opinion, are the demands of the Slovene side justified, and is 
it true, as the Slovene Government claims, that Slovenes are 
providing electricity to the Croatian consumers on credit? 
  [Begovic] The claims by the Slovene side proceed from a 
wrong assumption. Namely, Croatia does not buy electricity from 
the Krsko Nuclear Power Plant, we produce it there. This is not 
just a difference in the terminology, but in the understanding 
of the problems that have arisen concerning the nuclear power 
plant. The HEP regularly pays for the costs of electricity 
produced in this facility, which, for us, is very significant 
and valuable. This is not at all a matter of providing credit 
to the Croatian consumers. Such claims are inappropriate and 
unacceptable. [passage ommitted] 
  [Oreb-Jerkovic] In recent days you participated in a series 
of talks with Slovene officials in connection with these 
controversial matters. Boris Sovic, Slovene state secretary for 
energy, stated that some new ideas have been examined. What is 
at issue? 
  [Begovic] I have no knowledge of any new ideas. In past 
talks we presented nine points of interest for the Croatian 
side, in which we asked that the currently valid agreement of 
1970 and 1974 be respected. The basic problem is that Slovenia, 
from the moment it gained its independence, stopped complying 
with existing interrepublic agreements and annulled them by 
passing new decrees. 
  [Oreb-Jerkovic] Are you referring to the new law on 
employment of foreigners? 
  [Begovic] Yes, among other things, I am speaking about this 
new legal decree. It violates article 9 of the aforementioned 
agreement of 1970, which legally regulates the issue of parity 
of employment of specialized personnel in the Krsko Nuclear 
Power Plant. With subsequent dismissals of our workers, we have 
been gradually losing control over the management of funds. The 
parity of employment was violated by the unilateral behavior of 
the Slovenes in dismissing 19 Croat workers. Presently 110 
Croats and 500 Slovenes are employed in the plant. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Oreb-Jerkovic] What will you do if the Slovene side does 
not stop putting pressure on the HEP to pay the unpaid costs? 
  [Begovic] Recently, Slovene Ambassador to Croatia Matija 
Malesic stated in your paper that the Slovenes worry about their 
weekend homes in our part of the Adriatic sea. We also worry 
about our property. We feel that all these games about 
nonpayment of debts are an attempt to gradually take away our 
property. We will not accept the Slovene blackmail as long as 
clearly established investor rights are not respected by both 
sides. [passage omitted] 
  We at the HEP would have nothing against the Slovenes paying 
us $1 billion dollars, which is the value of our share in the 
nuclear power plant. We would be able to resolve the issue of 
the entire energy system in Croatia with these funds. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, leader of the Parliamentary </F>
Group of the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Noemi Sumegi; place 
and date not given: "We Maintain Our Cooperation With the 
FIDESZ -- Gabor Kuncze on Revanchism, the Prime Minister's 
Style, and What Could Be a Real Stir"] 
  [Text] The program-forming meeting of deputies of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] begins today, 28 January, and 
will last until 30 January. This is where it will finally be 
decided what political message the party will have for the 
Hungarian people at the 1994 elections. We interviewed Gabor 
Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of the SZDSZ, before the 
meeting. 
  [Sumegi] After so many exciting general meetings, this one 
promises to be a calm working conference. 
  [Kuncze] Indeed, we are not expecting any excitement. The 
SZDSZ is preparing for the elections and it is presenting a 
program to the citizens that is an alternative to the past four 
years and to the preceding 40 years. I will have to talk to the 
representatives of a united party at the general meeting: We 
will have to set out the direction of the program. 
  [Sumegi] What is your message for the voters? 
  [Kuncze] We can launch the country on the way toward 
security and prosperity! The SZDSZ has the necessary program 
for this. We cannot acquiesce in Hungary's current lack of 
success, which is not the fault of the people who have been 
working hard in the past four years and before; rather, it is 
the fault of the governments that have been unable to use these 
efforts in the interest of a successful Hungary. 
<H5>  Light Dreams </H5>
  [Sumegi] The SZDSZ is preparing for a governmental role full 
steam ahead. However, public opinion polls show that the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Federation of Young 
Democrats [FIDESZ] are leading neck and neck. 
  [Kuncze] The elections will be in May, and the SZDSZ will 
have to increase its support by then. However, the trends 
indicate that the SZDSZ has started "to go upwards." According 
to the latest opinion poll, the party's popularity already 
reaches 15 percent among those who will choose a party, and we 
reached this in three months. Almost 40 percent of the 
electorate would like to see us in government. There is a 
sympathy toward the SZDSZ, and we will have to change this into 
more votes. 
  [Sumegi] I will not ask you for coalition speculations, but 
I would like to outline two versions. What will happen if the 
MSZP wins? Many people think that the SZDSZ would be willing to 
form a government with the MSZP and this is also confirmed by 
the fact that the MSZP does not have a prime ministerial 
candidate. 
  [Kuncze] The SZDSZ is open to all democratic parties. It 
will decide on coalition when the election results, and whether 
the programs can be reconciled, are known. This is not 
influenced by the fact that the MSZP has not named a prime 
ministerial candidate. 
  [Sumegi] According to the FIDESZ, the socialists should be 
kept away from power for at least another four years if we want 
a real democratic "rotation" system. 
  [Kuncze] Things like this can be said but the electors will 
make the final decision. 
  [Sumegi] [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto once said that a kind of 
revanchist spirit has arisen among the supporters of the old 
regime, especially in the provinces. 
  [Kuncze] In my experience, people who lost their positions 
in 1989 and 1990 appear to be getting organized and they are 
becoming increasingly self-confident. There is a danger that, 
if they get back into power, people will feel that nothing has 
happened. This is regardless of the MSZP's national politics. 
At the same time, all political forces have a responsibility in 
preventing the domination of revanchism in Hungary. Taking 
revenge on people every four years would be an impossible 
situation. A country cannot operate like this. This has to be 
ended for once and forever. 
  [Sumegi] According to the other -- let us call it -- extreme 
idea, an agreement between [Prime Minister Peter] Boross and 
[FIDESZ Chairman] Orban would like to prevent the socialists 
from coming to power. 
  [Kuncze] When ideas like these surface, it would be best for 
the affected sides to comment on them. According to our 
agreement with the FIDESZ, its leaders should inform the SZDSZ 
about all such talks. We have not received any such 
information. The fact that certain parties talk about having to 
prevent another party from coming to power might indicate the 
lack of programs. However, if it is to indicate that, in this 
case, they will have to present a good program to the electors; 
then I can approve this. 
  [Sumegi] It is conceivable that it will not be possible to 
form a stable government and Boross will in the end be right 
because he said that, if something other than the current 
coalition comes to government, new elections will have to be 
called within a year. 
  [Kuncze] Boross is probably aware of the situation the 
country was brought into by the government led by the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF]. On this basis, he might even be right. 
However, I believe that if, in 1994, a coalition is formed that 
is able to present a united program to the people, and which can 
agree with the employers and the employees, then the government 
will be supported by the interest protection organizations. 
This way, a stable coalition can be established, and we bear 
this in mind. 
  [Sumegi] What are your views on the MDF's chances? In 
"crisis situations" -- voting for the budget or election of the 
prime minister -- the MDF has always been able to pull itself 
together. What can be Boross's role from this point of view? 
  [Kuncze] The MDF will lose the elections. It is 
undoubtedly true that, to the outside, Boross represents a 
different style compared to the previous period. The emphasis on 
the need for dialogue also indicates this. It is also apparent 
that he wishes to move the government toward pragmatic politics. 
  [Sumegi] As far as I can see -- and the SZDSZ has not 
indicated otherwise --he has not yet made any big mistakes since 
he became prime minister. 
  [Kuncze] This is true and when he does make one, we will 
certainly mention it. The prime minister has not done much good 
yet, either, and he could not have in this short time. He 
presents the activities of the MDF government in the past month 
as a series of successes. The electors will later express their 
views on the "series of successes." The question is how the 
forces in the MDF will influence Boross's scope for maneuver. 
It is certainly true that he simply does not deal with 
ideological issues. 
  [Sumegi] There is a significant uncertain strata in society 
which lost its faith in the MDF but cannot find a better party 
to suit its taste. 
  [Kuncze] In my view, a significant part of the MDF's voters 
have gone over to the MSZP, just as, at the time, people who 
otherwise were left-wing sympathizers had voted for the MDF 
because it had promised "light dreams" and painless transition, 
as opposed to the SZDSZ that had spoken honestly about the 
burdens of the changes. People were wrong in 1990 when they 
chose the MDF. The voters have now returned to the MSZP; many 
have also changed over to the FIDESZ but those people who are 
now leaving the FIDESZ increase the number of those who do not 
choose any parties. I do not believe that the MDF will be able 
to improve its position considerably. Today, in the view of the 
public, the SZDSZ is a party that has good ideas and promises 
safe changes. 
<H5>  The FIDESZ in the Center-Right </H5>
  [Sumegi] According to the FIDESZ's leaders, they pulled the 
SZDSZ into the center through the SZDSZ-FIDESZ agreement. On 
the other hand, you once said that the FIDESZ is around the 
SZDSZ. 
  [Kuncze] We should leave it to the electors to decide this. 
Public opinion polls have been placing the SZDSZ into the center 
and the FIDESZ either to the left or to the right of the SZDSZ. 
It was indeed I who said that, according to this, the SZDSZ is 
in the center and the FIDESZ is around us. However, the 
movement of the past one year indicates that the FIDESZ is 
moving to a center-right position, Orban has been taking his 
party in this direction. The question is what the electors will 
think of this. However, this does not mean that it is not the 
FIDESZ that is closest to the SZDSZ. 
  [Sumegi] According to the BESZELO, the SZDSZ and the FIDESZ 
are as happy about each other's problems as divorcees usually 
are. After the events of the past two months, people who have 
been hoping for a liberal victory might even be worried about 
the alliance of the two parties. 
  [Kuncze] In the Hungarian electoral system, the parties have 
to have themselves measured to find out their support. It is 
after this when it is worth talking about alliances. Therefore, 
in addition to being allies, we are also rivals of each other. 
We are not happy about the FIDESZ's quick loss of popularity 
because this weakens the liberal center. However, it is still 
worth maintaining our cooperation because this can be beneficial 
for both parties at the elections. 
  [Sumegi] In the MAGYAR NEMZET, [former MDF deputy] Jozsef 
Debreczeni said nothing less than that the SZDSZ and the 
intelligentsia that supports it tried to influence the FIDESZ's 
formidable politics against the successor party [MSZP] through 
[former FIDESZ deputy] Gabor Fodor. 
  [Kuncze] This is a usual twist in Debreczeni's thinking and 
it is not worth dealing with it. Naturally, the SZDSZ had 
nothing to do with the problems within the FIDESZ at the time. 
  [Sumegi] One of the goals of the FIDESZ-SZDSZ agreement was 
that the two parties would try not to set candidates against 
each other in six to 12 electoral districts. 
  [Kuncze] This is still a possibility, for example, the 
FIDESZ has not yet set a candidate in my district, and the SZDSZ 
has not yet named anyone in some districts. Another section of 
the agreement talks about automatic withdrawal [to the benefit 
of the other] between the two rounds, and this also can still be 
fulfilled. As for the period after the elections, we specified 
that we would always first talk to each other. However, even 
this does not mean any strict obligations, the two parties are 
still free to act as they wish. 
  [Sumegi] The biggest conflict between the two parties is in 
the local organizations, therefore, the withdrawals will not be 
so automatic. 
  [Kuncze] The leaderships of the two parties asked the local 
organizations in writing to take up contact with each other and 
to try to keep the emerging conflicts in normal channels in 
order to strengthen the liberal center. 
  [Sumegi] You are talking very cautiously.... 
  [Kuncze] I am making a conscious effort to be a politician 
who does not steer the political forces toward conflicts. I am 
aware of the serious differences of views between the various 
parties but these have to appear in a way that will give people 
options to choose from, rather than which will divide society. 
<H5>  Who Is on the Right Way? </H5>
  [Sumegi] To what extent is the media making the FIDESZ-SZDSZ 
conflict more acute? 
  [Kuncze] The press pays much attention to this issue because 
it would cause a big stir if cooperation between the two parties 
ceased to exist. When I give calm answers to these questions, 
journalists think that I am avoiding the answer and they are 
disappointed. However, my view on this issue is exactly what I 
said. 
  [Sumegi] To what extent will calm politics be 
characteristic of the campaign? According to Boross, it is 
important to keep a calm atmosphere. However, you have already 
been called a rascal by [MDF Executive Chairman] Sandor Lezsak, 
and some of your fellow SZDSZ members have been called traitors 
to the country. 
  [Kuncze] I would like the election campaign to be a 
competition of programs. This is needed because we must regain 
people's faith in politics. A vehement and negative campaign 
would even more convey the message that it is not worth dealing 
with "these" because all they try to do is discredit each other. 
I believe that Boross has the same view and I can see that 
Lezsak's views are different. When he called me a rascal, I 
deliberately did not react because I thought that sooner or 
later he would make a statement that comes up to the level where 
it is worth conducting a dialogue. It is a different matter 
that this has not yet happened. However, I am optimistic in this 
respect, too. 
  [Sumegi] If Lezsak is elected chairman of the MDF, to what 
extent will he be able to move the MDF in this direction? 
  [Kuncze] If he takes the party in this direction then the 
MDF will definitely be lost. Lezsak is already the executive 
chairman; in this position, he should be more careful about what 
he says and how he offends politicians. It is he who has to 
change in this respect; I am on the right road.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Kalman Lorincz, retiring </F>
commander of the Hungarian Army, by Zoltan Fekete; place and 
date not given: "I Am Leaving an Unhappy Army"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Fekete] Do you accept the 
opinion, according to which most of the officers of the 
Hungarian Army are leftist oriented? 
  [Lorincz] I know the officers and generals of the Hungarian 
Army professionally, and not from a political viewpoint. 
Therefore, I can responsibly state that most of the Hungarian 
soldiers are worth appreciating for both their professional 
activity and moral stand. Obviously, we had dirty affairs that 
cast a shadow on this image, but I think one should not evaluate 
the entire army and its officers and generals on the basis of 
these affairs. Our soldiers are disciplined and are carrying 
out their tasks in accordance with their oath. I do not recall 
a single case of failing to carry out my orders, although 
similar cases often took place in our region. Our staff of 
officers are not mediocre and, despite their faults and 
problems, they are worth much more than society thinks. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Fekete] Mr. Lorincz! How would you describe the army that 
you are going to hand over to your successor on 1 March? 
  [Lorincz] The army has preserved its combat readiness even 
if it has become unhappy. The most important thing is that we 
succeeded in stabilizing it, because the army is a very 
sensitive organization that can only function under calm 
circumstances. If there is no stability and everything 
disintegrates simultaneously, unpredicted changes can emerge, 
and this leads to new tensions. 
  I think we did not succeed in concluding anything, but we 
started something. 
  From an offensive army belonging to the Warsaw Pact, we 
began 
building a national army capable of carrying out defense tasks. 
This is a very complex process that needs 10-15 years to 
complete. We had to carry out radical changes at a much faster 
pace than normal. In addition, we had to do all this in harmony 
with the social changes. We had to meet the challenges of the 
prevailing international situation, and I do not only mean here 
the war in Yugoslavia, but also the reevaluation and 
restructuring of our entire system of military contacts. I know 
that we received a lot of criticism for not having this process 
concluded to this very day. I think our economic conditions give 
a perfect answer to this: Our budget is constantly decreasing 
and we are constantly using up our reserves, while our military 
equipment has become obsolete and the living standard of our 
professional staff continues to deteriorate. 
  [Fekete] What do you regard as the biggest shortcoming of 
your activity of more than four years? 
  [Lorincz] I could not do enough for our professional staff, 
commensurate with what their activity, moral stand, and honesty 
deserve. I am leaving a dispirited army. Not because the army 
does not agree with the changes, but because it has less 
opportunity to creatively assist these changes. I am convinced 
that, now when we are laying the pillars of the post-1995 
Hungarian Army, we should pay much more attention to the living 
problems of our professional staff. 
  [Fekete] What are the pillars you are talking about? 
  [Lorincz] We have already begun the process of developing 
the armed forces and creating the legal regulations of a new 
democratic army, because the Parliament adopted the security 
policy and defense principles, and a new defense bill has also 
been legislated. The bill on the soldiers' legal status is 
already on the government's table, a bill that, hopefully, would 
guarantee the long-term living conditions of our professional 
staff. We also started working out the personnel bases of the 
future army, including the new leadership and organizational 
principles. Last, but not least, an improvement in our military 
technology and weapons is currently under way. If I succeeded 
in contributing to all these processes, I can say that I am 
satisfied. 
  [Fekete] What is your opinion about the chances of the 
Hungarian Army to integrate into NATO? What new burdens would 
this mean for Hungary and for the Hungarian Army? 
  [Lorincz] The greatest advantage of the Partnership for 
Peace program is that it represents a realistic burden for the 
countries wishing to participate in it. We do not want to 
participate in a quantitative race; we would like to offer our 
quality to our partners. This could represent more both in time 
and funds than what we think today. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Richard Erdofy: "The Third Day of Michal Kovac's </F>
Visit to Poland"] 
  [Excerpt] Krakow -- Slovak President Michal Kovac, 
accompanied by his wife and entourage, flew to Krakow yesterday 
at the end of his three-day official visit to Poland. The Slovak 
president met at noon with representatives from the 
Cultural-Social Association of Czechs and Slovaks in Poland. 
Miloslav Molitoris, secretary of the expatriate organization, 
which has been operating in Poland since 1947, briefed the 
Slovak president on the problems facing the some 25,000-strong 
community in Poland. 
  At the moment, there are only two elementary schools in 
Poland where Slovak is the language of instruction -- in Nowa 
Biela and Jablonka. Slovak is taught in another 18 schools as a 
noncompulsory subject. Representatives from the Slovak 
organizations in Poland demanded that the teaching of Slovak at 
the high school in Nowy Targ, where Slovak was taught from 
1933-39, be recommenced and also that financial assistance be 
provided to enhance education. 
  Miloslav Molitoris praised the idea of opening the borders 
between Poland and Slovakia. According to him, "we want to have 
a border merely as an administrative line and not as a line that 
would divide us." He asked President Michal Kovac for help in 
obtaining Slovak priests from Slovak communities and also for 
the agreements from the former CSFR on good neighborliness and 
cultural cooperation -- which would make it possible to enrich 
the cultural lives of the ethnic Slovak citizens -- to be 
enshrined in the planned agreements with Poland. 
  The representatives from the Slovak organizations in Poland 
-- the Cultural-Social Association of Czechs and Slovaks, Matica 
Slovenska [The Slovak Heritage Foundation], and the St. Vojtech 
Society -- pointed out in the discussion that the Polish 
Constitution does not guarantee ethnic rights for the Slovak 
community. It does not have representatives in parliament or 
the mass media; there are also few Slovak representatives in 
self-administrative institutions. There are problems with 
teaching Slovak, the bilingual designation of communities and 
Slovak institutions, and religious services in Slovak. At the 
same time, they also expressed an interest in the restoration of 
their Slovak citizenship, which they lost in 1946 when the 
northern regions of Slovakia were annexed to Poland. The 
representatives from the expatriate organizations also demanded 
that the Slovak minority be enshrined legally in the 
constitutional law and that the Helsinki agreements on human 
rights, minority rights, and reciprocal rights -- which the 
Poles in Slovakia enjoy -- be implemented. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Marketa Fialkova, Czech ambassador to </F>
Poland, by Barbara Sulek; date and place not given: "We Do Not 
Insist on Being First in NATO"] 
  [Excerpts] [Sulek] You must be giving a lot of interviews 
in connection with the new situation that has arisen following 
the adoption of the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative. 
  [Fialkova] Not at all. This is the first. 
  [Sulek] Everyone wants to know if the Czech Republic really 
wants to join Europe, NATO, and the EU alone. 
  [Fialkova] It lies in our interests that the Czech Republic, 
Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary belong to the same security group. 
  [Sulek] But as far as PFP and NATO are concerned, the Czechs 
have definitely gone further than the others. 
  [Fialkova] The PFP declaration clearly states that all the 
countries will be assessed individually. It calls for the 
admission to NATO of each country individually, not as a group. 
  [Sulek] Prime Minister Klaus has himself said that he would 
like the Czech Republic to join Europe without Visegrad. 
  [Fialkova] I do not think Prime Minister Klaus has firmly 
rejected Visegrad cooperation, but what he wants is genuine 
cooperation, not just gestures and meetings. He is in favor of 
cooperation, but at an appropriate level. He does not insist on 
a total coordination of Visegrad activity. 
  [Sulek] But without this coordination, the Visegrad 
countries 
appear at odds with each other and incapable of joint, steady 
action. Perhaps a strong and cohesive Visegrad group does not 
lie in the interests of the United States and Russia? 
  [Fialkova] President Clinton made it clear that everyone is 
concerned about good practical regional cooperation, and that is 
what we want as well. A major feature of this cooperation is 
CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Agreement]. The Czech 
Parliament has already ratified this agreement, but the Polish 
Parliament was prevented from doing so by the parliamentary 
elections. CEFTA offers a very good scope of cooperation. 
Prime Minister Klaus wants this cooperation to start as soon as 
possible, so that a complete liberalization of trade may occur. 
Our trade with Poland has slumped in recent years, which is a 
great pity. 
  [Sulek] How do you explain that? 
  [Fialkova] It is largely due to Poland's protectionist 
policy 
and an absence of credit mechanisms to encourage trade. A major 
obstacle is the high Polish customs tariffs on our products, 
including cars. It lies in our interests that these tariffs 
disappear in regional cooperation. A prosperous Poland lies in 
our interests for it is good to have a rich neighbor with whom 
one can conduct trade at a profit. It also lies in our 
interests for the entire Visegrad group to belong to one single 
security system. We do not insist that we join NATO first. If 
Poland joins NATO first, we will be very happy about it. Our 
vice minister for national defense said at the defense 
ministers' summit that in such a case, we will be second, and we 
will use Poland's experience. 
  [Sulek] Do you not consider it possible that the Visegrad 
group might split up and some countries might join NATO and 
others not? 
  [Fialkova] We Czechs really do not want to split up the 
Visegrad group. 
  [Sulek] I am not saying the Czechs would do it. 
  [Fialkova] Well, anything is possible in politics. However 
such an eventuality is unlikely, because it takes two sides to 
do that. Even if someone on the outside wanted to stop our 
trade, he would not be able to do so because we are neighbors, 
and between neighbors there are natural economic, cultural, and 
political relations. And how can one stop trade? One cannot, 
if we ourselves do not want to stop it. 
  [Sulek] The Czech Republic is the only former communist 
country (not counting the GDR) to have clearly dissociated 
itself from its former structures, hierarchy, and influence. Do 
you think this had a bearing on your NATO talks and on the 
different treatment accorded to your country? 
  [Fialkova] There is no indication that NATO has treated us 
differently, and no one has said anything to this effect. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Sulek] You have been ambassador in Poland since April 1990. 
Has the Polish-Czech friendship established during the 
Solidarity era survived, and do you still have your old 
acquaintances? 
  [Fialkova] Yes. I have not quarreled with any of my old 
friends, and I am pleased to say that Polish-Czech relations 
have never been better. The Poles are liked by the Czechs and 
by the Slovaks, which is fantastic. I would be very happy if I 
could contribute something to that friendship.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish National Defense Minister Piotr </F>
Kolodziejczyk by Maria Wagrowska; place and date not given: "To 
Be Far From Politics"] 
  [Text] [Wagrowska] As the minister of national defense, 
when you were in office for the first time, in February 1991 you 
signed the document dissolving the military structures of the 
Warsaw Pact. Now you are implementing the program of military 
cooperation with NATO--the "Partnership for Peace." Has Poland's 
security been enhanced over the past three years, as Polish 
foreign policy has been reoriented toward the West? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Has it been enhanced in relation to which 
period? If we go back to the period of the Cold War, then I 
must say that, paradoxically, our security was greater because 
it was based on the parity of well-organized and fully 
controlled martial potentials. After the dissolution of the 
Warsaw Pact and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, control 
over the nuclear arsenal became noticeably weaker and is still 
incomplete. In this context, the agreement on Ukrainian nuclear 
disarmament, which U.S. President Clinton managed to negotiate, 
should be treated as a step that enhances the security of 
Europe--and also the security of Poland. Now we can only hope 
that this agreement will be put into effect fairly soon. 
  The present condition of our Army is so poor that, if we 
make 
the abstract assumption that Poland would have to wage a 
circular war [wojna okrezna], it would not allow us to ensure 
security to our country. That is certain. However, the issue of 
our sovereignty will not be decided in the military area; it 
will by decided by the economy. This does not mean that the Army 
would all of a sudden lose its importance. We are reforming it 
laboriously and, despite all of the financial problems, we seem 
to be closer to the goal that we have set. 
  [Wagrowska] Has the turnaround toward the West, declared by 
politicians, been approved of by the military? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] An obvious change has been made in the way 
we 
think about our security, first of all among the professional 
military cadres. The Army is not interested in being close to 
politics, maybe with a few exceptions. 
  The image of the enemy was long and persistently created in 
the Army; however, it was not perpetuated so much as to have any 
effect today. This was probably because our Army "is satiated" 
with people with university degrees. 
  I cannot say such good things about the issues of the 
organization of the Polish Army and the level of technology at 
its disposal. Unfortunately, the pace of change depends here on 
how much money we get, but not only on that.. Work on changing 
the legal foundations of the Army's functioning was only 
partially successful. The last two Sejms lacked the willingness 
to deal with these problems and to define what the civil 
Ministry of Defense should really be. Thus, the division of 
powers is still rather vague, and responsibility for issues of 
defense remains rather blurred. 
  [Wagrowska] I gather that completing the legislative work is 
your first and foremost request for the present Sejm. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The Sejm must eventually adopt appropriate 
constitutional and legal provisions. It must define the scope of 
responsibilities of the president, as well as the instruments by 
which he could fulfill his duties efficiently. Therefore, the 
Ministry of National Defense [MON] suggests that the Security 
Council be given such prerogatives that could allow it to 
influence the government's activities in the area of defense. 
The prime minister, according to the Constitution, is also 
responsible for the state's security. MON believes that the 
government's representatives in the Security Council should form 
a Committee of Defense Affairs in the Council of Ministers, 
which, similar to the Economic Committee of the Council of 
Ministers or the Social Affairs Committee, would deal with 
issues of state defense (not only the issues of the Armed 
Forces). The committee would submit concrete solution proposals 
to the Council of Ministers, which would accept them or not. 
However, the drafts of these solutions would have to pass an 
appropriate legislative path, or, if the powers of the 
government allow for this, they would be accepted directly by 
the Council of Ministers. 
  Such an attitude, however, calls for prior amending of the 
Small Constitution, as well as amending of the Law on General 
Duty of Defense of the Republic. This law must very precisely 
divide powers between the civilian defense minister and the 
General Staff head (now I am using the present name because 
there are suggestions that he be called the inspector general or 
the commander in chief). This process is under way. 
Unfortunately, the talks between ministries in all issues are 
extremely lengthy, and they raised many doubts of a political 
rather than a substantive nature. 
  [Wagrowska] When do you expect the legislation process to 
be complete? When do you plan to begin implementing reform in 
the Army? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I hoped that the prepared bills would be 
submitted in the Sejm as soon as January because the 
participants of the last session of the National Defense 
Committee expressed unanimous views on the issue of the bills. 
In the meantime, however, new problems cropped up, which I 
cannot understand at all. I am afraid that once again someone 
wants to cut down the legal regulations concerning the present 
state of affairs, as well as concerning certain politicians. 
  [Wagrowska] Who exactly is blocking the reform? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I will not say that because I do not want to 
aggravate the situation. MON has prepared a detailed set of 
regulations that defines the rights and duties in the ministry; 
however, this time it was I who blocked its 
implementation--untill the most basic decisions that we talked 
about are made. 
  [Wagrowska] However, the new command structures in the 
Polish 
Army depend on the Defense Ministry, but they are not 
functioning yet as well. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The work on correcting these structures is 
almost complete. Changes concerning the General Staff will be 
quite fundamental. In line with the new concept, the first 
soldier in the country--that is, the head of the General 
Staff--is supposed to bear the responsibility for training, 
combat readiness, and mobilization readiness of the Armed 
Forces. He will have five deputies: for strategic-defense 
planning, ground forces, air forces, navy, and logistics. The 
General Staff will be decreased and will be, in the event of the 
greatest need, a center that coordinates the combat efforts of 
the various types of forces. 
  The commander of the ground forces, which is the greatest 
novelty, will be the commander of corps-brigade structures, 
which, as I see it, are lighter and more mobile. In line with 
the previous strategic concepts, a military district became a 
self-dependent Army for the period of war. Poland had two Armies 
of the first group--made up of the Pomeranian district and the 
Silesian district--and one Army of the second group, formed on 
the basis of the Warsaw Military District. In line with today's 
doctrine of equal security of all borders, we have formed the 
Krakow district. 
  This is the general concept; however, as it always happens, 
the devil is in the details, and our officers in the General 
Staff are just now driving this devil away. We are planning to 
complete the work in February. MON would like to be able to 
implement the reform of command structures as soon as possible. 
  [Wagrowska] The importance of the Krakow Military District 
for state security has been discussed for some time now. 
However, somehow it just cannot be established. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] As I have said, the Krakow Military District 
is subordinated to the strategy of ensuring equal security on 
all of the state's borders. Previously, both in the south and in 
the east, on the so-called eastern wall, Poland was almost 
completely "naked." This must be rectified; however, it can only 
be achieved at the cost of formations that were many years ago 
grouped in the western part of the country. The Krakow Military 
District is being established, even though it is being done very 
slowly; this is because we have too little money, chiefly for 
infrastructure, which is extremely costly. 
  Being in a difficult financial situation, we decided to 
earmark all of the money that we had for the improvement of the 
technical condition of the Army. We could act this way because 
there is no danger of a sudden attack on our country; even in 
the event of any danger, we will undoubtedly have enough time to 
move the needed formations to the endangered region. Now, if we 
had wanted to distribute the money in a different way, if we had 
allocated a little for the infrastructure and a little for 
equipment, ages would have passed before we could achieve what 
we wanted. 
  [Wagrowska] The generals that I have spoken with stress that 
we should gradually stop maintaining the ground forces and that 
they should be transformed into air-ground forces. Do you share 
these opinions? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, I do because air-ground forces are more 
mobile and more efficient in combat; therefore, they would be 
better in warding off any attack. 
  [Wagrowska] A few years ago, the assumption was made that 40 
percent of the Armed Forces would stay in western Poland, 30 
percent would be stationed in the central part, and another 30 
percent would be in the east. How is the dislocation going? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I do not think that there is a chance to 
complete very soon the process of regrouping the Armed Forces 
from west to east, for the reasons that I have mentioned before. 
We are improving the positioning of soldiers by reducing 
garrisons in the western part of Poland. The idea of regrouping 
forces is the cause of alarm in the east. At this point, I would 
like to recall my recent talks with the Belarusian defense 
minister, who understands perfectly well that the shifting of 
our forces to the east is not supposed to pose any danger to his 
country. Politicians, however, sometimes use the issue of 
dislocation in their gamesmanship. I think that the fears of 
Ukraine and Belarus have been generated, among other things, by 
reprehensible negligence in the eastern policy of our country. 
Building a state's security, as I understand it, in today's 
European conditions should consist of maintaining as good 
relations with all neighboring states as possible; in close 
regional cooperation; in continental structures of security; 
and, finally, in disarmament. 
  [Wagrowska] What does the issue of changing the armament of 
the Army look like? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Unfortunately, I regret to tell you that, 
over the past few years, the Army has not received anything new, 
except a modernized tank, which is called "hard" but which 
actually is still not hard. We are still far from the 
technologies that we should have. 
  [Wagrowska] What, then, does the Polish Army need the most? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Fire systems and systems for controlling 
fire. Our scientists, to be sure, are close to building such 
systems, but we are not able to manufacture all of the 
components in Poland, or it simply does not pay to manufacture 
them all here. 
  [Wagrowska] Dangers to our security may be caused mainly by 
local conflicts around the Polish borders. All the same, it is 
known that the radio-electronic reconnaissance systems, the most 
important element in warning of impending danger, leave a lot to 
be desired. It is not even able to distinguish an enemy aircraft 
from our own because practically all aircraft in the neighboring 
states were made in the Soviet Union. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] All the same, the eastern wall is protected. 
To make the air surveillance system more efficient, we need at 
least 12 radio location stations with the "our-alien" 
reconnaissance systems. We are creating a new identification 
system. This issue is related to the problem of abandoning some 
frequencies, which has become well-known recently. We will not 
be able to abandon them until all of the location equipment in 
the planes and helicopters is replaced. The work on this, 
carried out jointly with "Thompson," will take from two to three 
years. 
  [Wagrowska] What are your priorities as far as cooperation 
with NATO is concerned? What is it exactly that Poland needs 
from the West, from the point of view of the requirements of our 
security? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] It is first of all technical and 
technological cooperation that allow us to take rational 
advantage of our scientific and production potential. So far, we 
have consistently been denied this help.

<F P=106> [Report by Katarzyna Jedrzejewska: "Budget in Sejm </F>
Deputies' Hands; 1993 Deficit Was Lower Than Expected by Half"] 
  [Text] Last year's deficit in the state budget was 
lower than expected by almost a half. Instead of the planned 81 
trillion zlotys [Z], the deficit was "just" Z43.8 trillion. So 
in the final analysis, it was even lower than predictions made 
two months before the end of 1993, when there was talk that it 
would be Z53 trillion. 
  Still, results of the final Treasury note auctions for 1993 
sent a clear message: The deficit must have been even lower, and 
that in spite of the fact that revenues proved higher than 
expected by more than Z25 trillion. 
  Today, as work on the 1994 budget continues, Sejm deputies 
who are members of different Sejm commissions are suggesting an 
increase in expenditures by an additional Z20 trillion compared 
to what the government had proposed. This must be supplemented 
by the Agricultural Commission's proposals to increase 
agricultural expenditures by -- according to preliminary 
calculations -- Z10 trillion. As a result, the parliament -- 
while adopting the 1994 budget law -- will have two options: 
either to approve exactly what the government proposed (with 
possible shifts in expenditure amounts between different 
sectors), or to enact higher expenditures. The latter solution 
would require another decision: Are we in favor of increasing 
budget revenues, the budget deficit, or the money supply? 
  Before decisions are made, it is worth taking a look at how 
much room there is for maneuvering, if at all. The Council of 
Ministers asked itself a similar question slightly over a month 
ago. As a result of a three-day debate, the government managed 
to come up with just Z2 trillion of additional revenue; and that 
was not from taxes since the finance minister had already done 
everything possible in that area by proposing amendments in tax 
laws which resulted in a total of Z25 trillion of additional 
revenue. 
  Sejm deputies are currently hoping for revenue from taxes to 
be imposed on stock-market derived income, which was not planned 
in the government's budget draft. But one will not be able to 
extract more than Z3 trillion out of that source, and it could 
be much less than that. 
  Nobody in the Sejm talks about increasing the budget deficit 
anymore, which was a suggestion made so often in previous years. 
Last year's problems with finding the money to finance the 
planned deficit proved more of a lesson than even the finance 
minister's very lengthy and persuasive speeches. 
  Today, pressure is directed somewhere else -- at the Polish 
National Bank. Sejm deputies are demanding an increase in the 
money supply by Z14 trillion, whereas the bank's representatives 
oppose the idea. There are fears that such a measure could 
become just another lesson in economics.

<F P=106> [Article by Al. Gavrilescu: "The Invisible War of the </F>
Reports Does Not Hide Poverty and Corruption"] 
  [Text] A year ago, before passing the baton of government, 
former Prime Minister Stolojan announced to members of his 
cabinet that it was time to put their files in order. The 
syntheses and points of view presented by the chief 
minister-secretaries of state and chiefs of departments, which 
were in the form of short reports, made references to the 
programs and specific strategies of economic reconstruction and 
to recorded results, as well as to the lack of fulfillment in 
the past, that has been allusively attributed to political 
confrontation. Of course! The objective of the first Romanian 
Government was not -- as has been believed -- the operating of 
the national economy, but the organization of parliamentary and 
presidential elections; a fact which displaced the interest 
centers and favored imbalance and the poor management of the 
public patrimony. The effects are known. Analyzed now in 1993, 
the summary report of the Stolojan government became interesting 
when the current executive saw fit to contradict suspicions with 
respect to the so-called stagnant condition by publishing the 
Vacariou report. This is interesting from many points of view. 
One of them, and we believe it is the most important, would be 
the credibility of the executive. Because it is tempting; on the 
first reading, the justification [is] that the inherited crisis 
represents the result of policies which were not founded on 
macroeconmic performance criteria, "amplified also by the errors 
of the previous government." As we learn from the Vacaroiu 
report, to these [factors], inflation and foreign debt should be 
added, impacting directly on the entire system of national 
production and social life. In other words, in his short history 
as minister of economy and finance, George Danielescu asserts, 
in September 1992, exactly the opposite: that the Romanian trade 
balance recorded visible improvement; this balance for the first 
six months being higher -- by $316 million compared to the same 
period in 1991! And yet, for the first time, the balance between 
demand and supply on the currency market created the 
preconditions for keeping inflation under control and 
stimulating foreign investment. Taking a contrary view, the 
Vacaroiu report indirectly conducts a polemical discussion with 
the former government, revealing that the country's monetary 
resources were consumed in 1991 and 1992, and for this reason, 
Romania contracted new loans, accumulating a debt of $2.2 
billion. Moreover, the service on the foreign debt -- the 
interest rate and installment payments -- will be $340 million 
by the end of 1993. 
  Going through Stolojan's balance sheet, we should bear in 
mind that the movement of consumer prices registered the lowest 
increase for the past 12 months. In other words, the financial 
and budgetary policy of the former government, that of 
austerity, was still tolerable under the conditions of an 
aggressive fiscal environment, as well as in conditions of 
credible social production. 
  In the midst of difficulties with the reform process, Prime 
Minister Vacaroiu attacks the poor performance in fulfilling the 
conditions stipulated in the agreements, concluded with 
international financial insitutions by former prime ministers 
Roman and Stolojan. These conditions should have been 
instituted, however, during 1991-92. The lack of a line of 
credit in 1993, caused by the abandonment of the credit 
contracts, should be attributed to the former dignitaries. Valid 
or not, it remains clear in the statistics that the 1992 budget 
had every chance of assuring the criteria listed in the standby 
agreement with the International Monetary Fund: that is to say, 
limiting inflation, stabilizing the economy, and consolidating 
fiscal measures. The linguistic war is all the more confusing in 
that the Stolojan government took pride in its balance sheet, in 
exceptional international banking relationships, as well as in 
calming the Western reservations concerning the Romanian reform. 
  Last but not least, in the framework of these two reports, 
the indices of the monthly rate of inflation are in sharp 
contrast with each other. For example, in the month of June 
1992, the wholesale prices and the consumption prices registered 
a rate of 10.8 percent, considered by specialists at that time 
as a corrective inflation, as a result of the devaluation of the 
national currency and the reduction of subsidies for consumer 
goods and services. 
  The Vacaroiu administration admits [its role] in the 
devaluation which resulted in the diminished purchasing power of 
the national currency. Although it is under control, the 
phenomenon has developed in an anarchic manner, and given that 
the rate of inflation should not surpass 70-80 percent, the 
objective of the socioeconomic reform strategy has remained 
dubious! 
  From all of this theoretical and statistical harassment, the 
citizen has no way to evaluate the performance of the governors.

<F P=106> [News conference by Civic Alliance Party Leader Nicolae </F>
Manolescu with unidentified correspondents; place and date not 
given: "The Diversion Gambit of the `Future for Romania Group'"] 
  [Text] Starting with the conclusion of the group "For the 
Future of Romania" [UVPR], brought together to discuss "Where 
goes Romania?", Mr. Nicolae Manolescu stated at the PAC [Civic 
Alliance Party] news conference held last week: ``In our 
opinion, in no way are we faced with the problem of identifying 
the lack of a dialogue between the government and the opposition 
as the main cause of the current situation. Please note that 
this view is synonymous with the one used by Mr. Iliescu many 
times, and summarized in one word: consensus. Mr. Iliescu's 
consensus dream has taken here a more explicit form of the one 
between the government and the opposition. I do not want to 
overstress the fact that, if this dialogue, one absolutely 
normal in a democratic society, was not sufficiently clear and 
supportable, then it was not in most cases because of the 
opposition, but rather the government, which rejected all those 
proposals and suggestions from the opposition that could have 
gotten the discussions underway. The events are well-known. 
Every time the opposition asked the government for certain 
things that, in our opinion, were obligatory, the government 
rejected them. Every time the government was brought into a 
situation to implement the opposition's program, the government 
turned it to its own benefit. The most glaring example is the 
reorientation of the current government team in Romania from the 
East to the West, and from the CIS towards Euro-Atlanticism. 
This is a reorientation that can be very easily seen if I can 
remind you that, beginning with the August 1991 putsch and 
continuing, not directly in chronological order, with the treaty 
between Mr. Iliescu and Mr. Gorbachev, for a long time in first 
place in the negative reporting in many publications, the 
Government of Romania started to look to the East and precisely 
towards the CIS. The government took the country towards the 
West at the point when, to our good fortune, Gorbachev and 
Gorbachevism fell from favor in Russia, at the point when Russia 
radicalized itself. And, in recent times we have witnessed a 
sort of victory celebration on the part of the people who just 
one or two years ago were speaking only about the treaty with 
Gorbachev, but who are now speaking about the eventual 
agreements with Bill Clinton and our entrance into Europe and 
the Council of Europe. Just as, in the end, these gentlemen were 
the ones who brought about this extraordinary reorientation of 
our entire lives from the East to the West. Last night, they 
signed the document to establish the Consultative Council for 
Euro-Atlantic Integration, a document that has its roots in the 
opposition. This document came out of the ranks of the 
parliamentary opposition and is one that was finally accepted by 
the government. The opposition also sent representatives to this 
meeting, and Mr. Iliescu had an entourage there (don't blame me; 
that's what Mr. Iliescu calls it), and the ministries and other 
organs of the government were also represented there. Currently, 
the opposition's arguments for the West and for European 
integration can no longer be combated by the government. At this 
time, the government can no longer bet on the CIS and Yeltsin 
(if the government would do what Yeltsin is doing in Moscow, we 
could also avoid some problems), and, so, it is betting on the 
West and Euro-Atlanticism, and it wants to profit from this, 
which is not correct. The wolf can change his clothing, but not 
his habits. The government was represented by Mr. Gherman. More 
importantly, the PSM [the Socialist Party of Labor] as well as 
the PRM [the ROMANIA MARE Party] were there, but not represented 
by their presidents. Furthermore, they tabled a declaration that 
noted that they are signing the document, but have important 
reservations concerning several of its provisions. I would have 
admired the PDSR [the Romanian Social Democratic Party] if it 
had taken a similar action. The PDSR, however, completely 
changed its clothing. In this case, it bears no resemblance to 
the wolf of old, and it signed the document, after which the 
Romanian mass-media presented us with the interesting 
observation that this Consultative Council was a consensual 
effort. Returning to the analysis at the beginning here, I think 
that the real motives for the current situation are of a factual 
and governmental nature, not theoretical and oppositional or 
dialogue focused. I say factual and governmental because the 
government is the one that must implement the reform program 
with everything that it involves. And the government, what does 
it do? So you can understand, I will tell you what was proposed 
to us today in the Senate as a radical measure to improve our 
standard of living during the winter. In opening the meeting, I 
made a statement where I protested the manner in which we are 
treated in our homes, with no heating or hot water. I said that 
I understand that the government did not deliver on its promises 
that we would have heating oil and all the other things, because 
this is not the first promise that this government has not kept. 
But, what I do not understand is why we are paying for that 
which the government has not provided. The result of this was 
that one of our colleagues from the PDSR accused me of populism. 
Today, in conclusion, the government, informed by my populism, 
came forward with a radical measure: some allocations for the 
disadvantaged categories of people in order to pay for the 
recent increases in heating costs. I will ignore the amount of 
the allocation, which is sufficient for you to eventually buy an 
amount that would fill a lantern. I will also ignore the source 
of this money, which will only be partially covered by the 
budget, with the remainder coming from a tax that you will pay 
when you leave the country to travel abroad. The paradox is that 
those who leave and do not use heating pay more than those who 
stay and use it. The solution would be for as many people as 
possible to leave. If 40 percent of Romania's population were to 
leave, the remaining 60 percent could get heating. Such a plan 
is not far removed from what Ceausescu was also doing, giving us 
a few lei compensation for one thing or another. The gentlemen 
from "A Future for Romania" say that the political parties in 
the opposition have not answered the question "where goes 
Romania?" Yes, we have responded: towards capitalism. We were 
timid at first to say that word, but we have taken the bull by 
the horns and answered: back to capitalism! 
  ``I am very worried that the manner in which `A Future for 
Romania' presents this problem sounds like a diversion: Let's 
give a dose of the politicians to the people, the people who 
cannot buy necessities and who are dying from the cold, and 
let's explain to the people that, if bread now costs what it 
does and if it is cold in your home like during the Ceausescu 
era, this has nothing to do with the government, with Mr. 
Vacaroiu, or with the stalled negotiations with the trade 
unions, but rather it has a direct and personal link with the 
politicians, especially those in the opposition. Right before 
you is one of the people to blame for the situation in the 
country.'' 
  In conclusion, Mr. Nicolae Manolescu pointed out the members 
of the leadership of the PAC, present at this conference, as the 
"guilty ones," from the diversionist point of view of the 
above-mentioned group. Since the speech was very comprehensive, 
there were no further questions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Post Bank President Elena Petculescu by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "No One 
Claims To Not Want Privatization, but No One Says That It Needs 
To Happen"] 
  [Text] [ROMANIA LIBERA] Ms. President, the bank that you 
head is a relatively new institution in the financial-banking 
picture. I remember that within the framework of your seminar 
regarding the history of banking you presented a work entitled 
"The Post Bank -- A Young Bank With a Dynamic Evolution." For 
our readers, would you, please, review its path since its 
creation? 
  [Petculescu] In fact, the Post Bank is a young bank, one 
created by government decree on 1 July 1991. We are a state 
institution having received an initial level of social capital 
of 450 million lei, of which 226 million lei had been obligated 
at that time. Not long after our establishment, the National 
Bank set the minimum level of capital at 700 million lei and we, 
therefore, also had to increase our capital to 900 million lei, 
otherwise it would have been impossible to operate. With these 
actions we began, and we have the full amount of capital 
required. But, we have problems once again, since the central 
bank has once again increased the minimum level of capital to 2 
billion lei, and once more we need to find new sources of 
capitalization. In order to achieve this, I have gone to our 
current owners, the State Property Fund and the Private Property 
Fund, so as to give us the opportunity to increase our capital. 
I want to mention that last year's dividends were paid in full 
to these funds. With regards to our network of banks, we have 41 
branches throughout the country, aligned with the 
administrative-territorial districting, in each of the judet 
capitals. In addition to this, there are 10 offices and the 
central headquarters. Beyond our own network, we also work 
through the more than 3,000 post offices on the basis of an 
agreement reached with the Romanian Postal System. 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] I would like, nonetheless, to return to the 
issue of capitalization, a problem confronting the majority of 
banks operating on state capital. In the wake of the latest news 
conference organized by the BNR [Romanian National Bank], an 
agreement was mentioned, one signed by the central bank with 
EBRD [European Bank of Reconstruction and Development] precisely 
for the capitalization of these banks. What is the status of 
implementing this agreement? 
  [Petculescu] To date, nothing has been finalized, with there 
being the intention of both the World Bank and EBRD of being 
involved in this capitalization process. But, in order to do 
this certain conditions were imposed, such as the privatization 
of the banks. In this regard, each commercial bank funded by 
state capital was given a document, and was even invited to a 
discussion with these two organizations on this theme. In 
principal, no one is saying that they do not want privatization, 
but also no one is stating that this must take place. In my 
opinion, those who are our owners must give their opinion. I am 
referring to the appropriate moment for privatization, and also 
to the conditions for such an action. 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] Is it true that by taking advantage of the 
services of the more than 3,000 post offices you have exceeded 
the CEC [Savings and Loan Bank] network, which had been 
recognized as having the largest number of units in the country? 
  [Petculescu] I want to be very clear: We were not created to 
break the CEC monopoly, as one newspaper noted. We were 
established as a full-service bank, and we carry out all the 
operations of a commercial bank. Furthermore, we aim at 
attracting the people's savings. If the banking services that we 
offer and will continue to offer are more attractive, with more 
flexible rates, with certain services, then it is normal for 
competition to exist. 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] Would you like to refer to these banking 
services? 
  [Petculescu] We have created certain savings programs. Some 
are passbook accounts, with the depositor being able to make a 
deposit without selecting a specific period of time, for which 
the interest rate is 35 percent. We also have, however, term 
savings accounts for periods of three, six, and 12 months, with 
rates of 45, 55 and 70 percent, respectively. The advantage of 
these accounts, I would say, is not just the fact that our 
potential client can make a deposit for a shorter period of time 
for which he can get interest, but, first of all, that we have 
not required a very large minimum deposit. The minimum deposit 
is not 100,000 lei, but rather 5,000 lei. On one hand, if the 
depositor goes to his account and withdraws a certain amount of 
money, he will receive interest on his passbook account and, on 
the other hand, the party has the opportunity to benefit from 
credit in the amount of 80 percent of the amount on deposit. 
Thus, if he has an account balance of 100,000 lei, he could get 
80,000 lei in credit and the cost would be the difference 
between the interest rate on the account and the interest rate 
of the loan. Ultimately, it would cost him about 10 percent. We 
also have a fixed-amount passbook account (25,000 lei) and 
interest rate, which is like a type of value book. The depositor 
can hold onto it and he will be paid interest or he can purchase 
goods instead. But, the most important payment instruments are 
the checks that belong to the holder of a personal account. In 
this way, we offer the possibility to any citizen to open a 
personal account on the basis of which he becomes the holder of 
a checking account. With this account, upon acceptance, he can 
pay for certain services that are offered. We have already 
concluded agreements with 15 commercial agencies, including gas 
supply companies, Romtelecom, and telephone service payments, 
with the idea of paying with these checks rather than cash. 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] Can you tell us something about your loan 
policy? 
  [Petculescu] With regards to credit, I would like to tell 
you 
that in January 1992, through April 1993, we were not in a 
position to grant loans to commercial agencies except for a 
30-day loan period. For the people, we issued short-, medium-, 
and long-term loans. Certainly, this was a safeguard since we 
were required to be prudent and not make any mistakes. Despite 
all this, our results were very good. Under conditions where we 
had to operate with restrictions, the Post Bank profits in the 
first year were 500 million lei, while, today, in just 10 months 
our profit is 4.4 billion lei. We started to issue loans for a 
maximum term of one year and to give them to commercial 
agencies. Currently, about 20-25 percent of our loans go to the 
people and the remainder are for commercial entities. We have 
reached a volume of 22 billion lei for companies and 3.9 billion 
for the people. And, in conditions where funding sources have 
become very expensive, the loans for the population have become 
unprofitable. A recent calculation showed that if we continue to 
give loans to the people we will record losses of approximately 
55 million lei per month. 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] Given that you are a still-developing bank, 
what seems to you to be the most important project in the future? 
  [Petculescu] Right from the beginning we wanted to have an 
information system, which, currently, is being implemented, one 
requiring us to move through a number of stages. We are in the 
first stage, the creation of a prototype facility, after which 
we need to connect eight branches (located throughout the 
country), then to expand the network of all the branches to the 
information branch, which will be located in Bucharest. 
Similarly, I would stress the cooperation with the Post Bank in 
Holland for introducing the "Gyro" payment system, where cash 
payments are replaced with electronic payments. 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] As you well know, since the beginning of 
this month the National Bank increased the interest rate on 
overdraft loans, as well as the level of required minimum 
reserves. What do you think the bank was pursuing by these 
decisions and what are their effects? 
  [Petculescu] According to the legal regulations, the 
National Bank, as the central bank, is empowered to establish 
and direct monetary, hard currency, and loan policy. Through the 
measures you mentioned, the National Bank is pursuing the 
avoidance of making loans without sufficient reserve funds, the 
restriction of loans generated by inflation, and the reduction 
of the amount of money in circulation.

Syndrome of Procrastination"; first five paragraphs are Palade's 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Center for Political Studies and Comparative 
Analysis (CSPAC) is a nongovernmental research institute which 
deals with the analysis of social, economic, and political 
problems of transition in postcommunist societies. In 1993 the 
center launched a series of debates on these topics and held one 
of the summer courses offered by the University of the Black 
Sea, a course entitled "Crisis Management During the Transition 
Process." 
  Recently the center compiled and presented to public opinion 
the basic list of the significant problems for Romanian society 
which have remained unresolved during the period of 1990-93. 
Called residual problems, they constitute the object of a 
research program initiated by CSPAC and carried out by a 
multidisciplinary team made up of Dorel Sandor, Varujan 
Vosganian, Ulm Spineanu, Ilie Serbanescu, Lucian Mihai, Victor 
Ciorbea, Gabriel Ivan, Andrei Musetescu, Costea Munteanu, 
Mariana Celac, Denisa Ionete, and Horia Murgu. 
  The study's objective consisted in the systematic analysis 
of 
the SYNDROME OF PROCRASTINATION. This term means above all the 
ignoring of real needs, delays, half-measures, and failures 
through which COUNTER-REFORM acts as a parasite on the national 
effort to transform our society. The accumulation of these 
problems constitutes a dominant characteristic of the transition 
period in Romania. 
  Last week at GDS [Group for Social Dialogue] headquarters, a 
discussion took place with representatives of the CSPAC. We have 
selected several excerpts from that discussion. Among the 
participants we will mention: Magda Carneci, Mariana Celac, 
Andrei Cornea, Gabriel Andreescu, Mircea Diaconu, Ioan Popa, 
Victor Babiuc, and representatives of CSPAC--Dorel Sandor, 
Varujan Vosganian, Ilie Serbanescu, Ulm Spineanu, and Costea 
Munteanu. 
  We have also included in these pages part of the list of 
residual problems which CSPAC inventoried. We should mention 
that the entire text appeared in this year's 5 October issue of 
ROMANIA LIBERA and in this year's 8 October issue of TINERETUL 
LIBER. [See box at end of article.]

<H3>  An Analysis Which Describes the Current Stage of the Reform 
Process </H3>
  [Dorel Sandor] Our project starts from the common-sense 
observation that everyone wants reform in Romania, but, at the 
same time, anyone can see that obstructions have accumulated 
over the last four years; these obstructions are a result of 
problems which have been either ignored for a long time, or 
which, over the process of being resolved, have acquired a 
handicap in relation to the demands of reality. 
  Recently, we compiled this list of problems, a list which 
remains open-ended. We started from the following hypotheses: 
  1) The problems are ones of public interest; 
  2) They are tied to the process of transition imposing 
conditions on the advance of Romanian society toward a 
democratic society; 
  3) They are found in the sphere of action of state 
institutions (the governing party and the political coalition 
which supports it, and the legislative and executive branches 
with the group of "technocrats of transition") which have 
prerogatives and competencies, and therefore resources, and 
which should take on the task of achieving institutionalized 
reform. 
  The performance of the government is a problem for political 
analysis everywhere, but for Romania, unfortunately, it is 
easily marked by subjective, personalized, and somewhat 
caricatured approaches. One of the objectives of this project is 
to remove this analysis of government performance from under the 
sphere of influence of petty passions, from under the incidence 
of approaches characterized by petty ambition, and from under 
the perspective of a deadline arising out of the circumstances 
of the moment. 
  After four years, the quantitative dimension of these 
problems (the list contains 103 points, but it remains 
open-ended) has already reached a critical threshold, which 
necessitates a special approach. Many of these problems together 
form structures of procrastination, structures of bundles of 
residual problems which already tend to dominate the complex 
process of transition. Procrastination, the accumulation of or 
the blocking of the resolution of problems of this kind, has 
appeared during the past year, after the September 1992 
elections, to be an obvious characteristic of the government. 
  Therefore, our analysis assumes these three characteristics: 
the quantitative dimension, the structural dimension, and 
the characteristic of the transitional processes at the level of 
the macroeconomic and macropolitical decisionmaking process. 
  Another reason/motive which we considered made this analysis 
necessary is the fact that, in our estimation, the coming year, 
1994, will be a year when we reach a crossroads: The residual 
problems can engender a crisis of procrastination capable of 
provoking instability and social convulsions (I believe that the 
latter alternative has no more than a 15-percent chance of 
coming about, but that percentage is already a troublesome one). 
Or, on the contrary, these problems can become a kind of 
normality of Romanian reality; they can impose a 
long-term--10-15 years--pace on the course of transition in 
Romania by becoming a political practice which could legitimize 
institutions and a political style of this type. Because of 
this, Romanian society will become marginalized in the overall 
regional competition of transition. 
  We do not wish to call for the government's resignation; our 
objective is to track down what the resources are which Romania 
is wasting by maintaining these problems in a residual state. 
And then we need to find out who is paying the price of these 
examples of procrastination, and whether the current mechanisms 
of the state structure and of the opposition's alternative 
structures are in a position to tackle the problems in a 
pragmatic and positive way, and what the alternative solutions 
would actually be. 
  I would like to say a little bit about the list of problems 
itself, which, I repeat, remains open-ended: It contains several 
layers, several fields of facts. A first layer refers to the 
(relative) tearing away from the system of real socialism with a 
centralized economy, a tearing away which came about in our 
country through convulsive events. Even the confusion, the fact 
that very important areas connected to December 1989 are still 
enigmatic, shows the way in which Romania entered into the 
process of transition. A second layer of problems refers to the 
way in which what is called postrevolutionary institutional 
construction took place: the state institutions, the machinery 
of decisionmaking, the machinery which creates the institutional 
balances in Romania. 
  After that, we are interested in several fields connected 
with local government and urban planning, and then the situation 
of the communities and of the human factor in the various 
aspects of the process of transition--from tensions between 
ethnic groups to tensions between religious groups, and up to 
the reactions of the citizens to the new challenges of 
transition. An important area refers to social protection, not 
just as a protection vis-a-vis economic problems proper, but 
even more as the balance between change and the costs of change 
experienced by the populace. It seemed to us that the problems 
which are appearing in the fields of health and education, in 
the cultural milieu, and in the field of training are 
symptomatic. 
  We are also very much interested in the structural rift in 
the framework of the Romanian economy, where privatization and 
decentralization represent two major and mutually very 
intertwined processes. It is in the area of economic reform that 
the most important rifts have been engendered, but also that the 
most significant obstacles have appeared. Also, in closing, we 
proposed to link together several of the topics of international 
interest with a direct impact domestically, topics connected 
with foreign aid; with relations with international economic 
institutions (the IMF, and so forth); and relations with 
Bessarabia, with Russia, and with Eastern Europe--all of these 
things with a view to an opening toward the international 
economic environment. 
<H5>  A (Desired?) Tool in the Hands of the Political Element </H5>
  [Ilie Serbanescu] The finalization of this synthesis holds a 
completely special importance, because it brings to our 
attention, in a concentrated form, everything that has been 
started--as far as reform is concerned--and not finished. Out of 
these 103 points, 80 percent represent, in fact, things which 
have not even been started. If we take an inventory of these 
problems, we see that, out of everything that should have been 
done, some things never were in the plans of anyone with the 
power to make decisions; they are at most in the mind of those 
people with common sense. 
  The team that drew up this synthesis did nothing more than 
give an expression to common sense. In fact, it is not an 
analysis, it is a finding, an instrument which is available to 
the political element. I do not know if it also suits the 
political element. But if the political element (particularly 
the parliament and the executive) would happen to set to work, 
that element would have something to do. 
  [Andrei Cornea] I would like to know if these points of 
procrastination can be reduced to a sufficiently small number of 
fundamental points from which the others would follow, 
especially since I believe that the procrastination is 
self-reproducing. Therefore, the first question would be to what 
extent these problems can be condensed and how a certain system 
can be devised which would say something about our society. 
  In the second place, it would be interesting to know what 
the 
explanation for the procrastination would be. Are we witnessing 
a lack of political will--that is to say, an incapacity to 
remove the points of procrastination--or are we in fact 
witnessing a political will pulling in the opposite 
direction--that is, a will to procrastinate? This question 
should be posed, even if it is not always a matter of either/or 
but can sometimes be both. 
  Finally, there would also be the matter of the consequences: 
To what extent can interventions from certain points be 
productive and create once again snowballing effects in other 
fields? 
  [Dorel Sandor] Costea Munteanu will answer your first 
question. Regarding the causes of the procrastination, we have 
established 15 levels of analysis. Among these I would call to 
mind the institutional obstacles, the critical points, and the 
stage which each problem is in, the interest groups favored by 
the procrastination, the costs, the resources wasted due to the 
procrastination, and a whole series of errors or failures which 
have obstructed or favored a certain hijacking of the process of 
change. We can also make it obvious exactly what is the 
mechanism or the institution which is being aimed at or is the 
most active in obstructing some matters, elements of management, 
of resources. 
  As for the consequences, I think that the following is one 
of 
the chief reasons why we did the analysis: to see whether the 
costs of reform in Romania have not somehow exceeded the 
benefits of reform, and whether these costs could not--as in 
other Eastern European countries--reorient the overall national 
interest toward transition, to influence it, or to lead it in a 
totally unexpected direction. 
  [Ulm Spineanu] In putting this study together, we did not 
propose to analyze any particular program of governance. We 
started from the effects and in that way saw that some problems 
had not been tackled at all. On the other hand, these problems 
tend at a certain point--through circumstances which are very 
hard to appraise in the way they work together in the social 
spectrum--to have both institutional influence and influence in 
the legislative process, given the reform process itself as 
lived from day to day. 
  As they are posed there, these problems represent clear 
points which can create elements of a great range in the fields 
with which they can be correlated. The option of boiling these 
problems down in some way to a few essential ones--which would 
mean that we would, however, lose precisely the image and 
definition of each consequence of the various problems--would 
mean that we would make the mistake which everyone who has put 
forward ideas of governance has made: They have proposed 
programs as such, programs which do not factor in these 
consequences, which, as we can see, are now becoming factors 
stifling people's enthusiasm for reform. 
  On the other hand, if up to around six months ago people 
were 
working with half-measures, now we are in a system of 
quarter-measures. We can observe completely undefined measures 
everywhere, including in political discourse, not to mention in 
economic or social discourse. Everything that is being done 
appears as if it were seen through a smoke screen: Behind the 
smoke screen are those who are proffering the measures, while in 
front of it are those who are at the receiving end of those 
measures, but who cannot understand them or explain them. And 
through this smoke screen the germs of social instabilities are 
already starting to appear. It is even within the realm of 
possibility that we will get to the point where certain claims 
are forcefully imposed, if we take account of the government 
desire to preserve itself. 
<H5>  Transition in Romania Up To Now--a Failed Process </H5>
  [Costea Munteanu] In the economic area, we have identified a 
total of 39 residual problems--put another way, of unresolved 
aspects in the process of transition. In the final analysis, 
they can be considered as forms of manifestation of two 
fundamental structural distortions of the Romanian economy: 
the first is the imbalance between consumption and 
resources (the synthetic form of expressing the latter is 
the fact that imports for the daily consumption by the economy 
and by the population surpass the resources which can be 
procured through exports), and the second distortion is 
the vicious circle between domestic inflation and foreign 
depreciation. 
  These two fundamental structural distortions are, in origin, 
of different kinds: the imbalance between consumption and 
resources is an inherited structural distortion; the deficiency 
of the post-Decembrist policy of reform is that it has not even 
attacked this problem. On the other hand, the vicious circle 
between domestic inflation and foreign depreciation is a product 
exclusively of policy after December, a policy of half-measures 
which is called pathological gradualism. 
  As we know, there are two ways of approaching reform: shock 
therapy, in which the authorities take the measures completely 
and implement them all at once in order to carry out reform, or 
gradualism--in other words, they divide the implementation of 
the particular measure into successive phases. Pathological 
gradualism is the one which loses the needed sequence along the 
way and ends up where it started from. In the case of the 
applying of normal gradualism, adverse reactions appear in the 
environment in which it is operating, until complementary 
measures are applied. 
  When these adverse reactions appear, instead of considering 
them a signal that the transformations should be speeded up, our 
own governmental teams have done the very opposite: They have 
accentuated administrative intervention. Practically, in the 
final analysis, this has in fact meant that there is an 
orientation which is counter to reform, because the result has 
been something other than the one they had counted on. The field 
of price liberalization, and especially of the mechanisms of 
formation, is illustrative in this regard. 
  I am trying to answer Mr. Cornea regarding the causes of 
these instances of procrastination--whether they are in the 
sphere of the lack of political will, or whether they spring 
from incompetence. My feeling (from the experience which I had 
when I spent a short period of time in the government) is that 
we are dealing with a combination of the two. For example, in 
the area of prices one can consider that there were also 
premeditated elements which had the effect of ensuring that not 
even up to the present time, after the four successive phases of 
liberalization, has the mechanism of formation been completely 
liberalized. In this case we are dealing with premeditation but 
also with incompetence. And when I refer to incompetence, I 
refer also to the lack of courage to apply a measure which 
introduces effects of shock into the economic and social system. 
  If the people in our government have sinned in any way, it 
is 
through fear that they have sinned; and if they can be 
characterized in any way, again it is by their fear. The 
reformist type of person must, in my opinion, be the decisive 
type. But here the dilemma appears between maintaining your 
position high official and not making allowances for this 
personal career objective, regardless of what happens with your 
position. 
  Due to this pathological gradualism, the transition in 
Romania up to now is a failed process; it has involved high 
social and economic costs, while the results do not justify 
these costs. 
<H3>  From the Government's Standpoint, the Reform Process Is a 
Success </H3>
  [Valeria Pascariu] We see a list of problems which we 
consider failures of the present government. But what categories 
of interests does the government express? Because the essence of 
a government always lies in the protection of a category of 
interests. It seems to me that this category of interests 
protected by the present government is the category of interests 
of part of the state industry--that is, the industry which 
formerly represented the ideological obsession of the communist 
regimes: the petrochemical industry, the iron and steel 
industry, and so forth. Faced with the choice between 
unemployment and inflation, the populace has chosen the 
alternative of inflation and has rejected that of unemployment; 
through this choice, it has given its stamp of approval to this 
variant. 
  If we look at things from the viewpoint of the government 
(which deliberately planned not to carry out reform and planned 
to protect the interests of this industry), we see that the 
government is, in fact, a success. All the other things are 
concessions or secondary problems; privatization is clearly a 
secondary objective. When the government reaches the point where 
it may run into a crisis in ensuring foreign financial resources 
for this industry, due to its failure to sign the stand-by 
accord with the IMF, then it will begin to make concessions on 
the plane of reform. 
  [Dorel Sandor] There are five reasons why we chose a problem 
here: The first reason is so that some of these problems might 
be tackled in a program of governance or in a political position 
of a programmatic nature (we did not refer solely to the 
Vacaroiu government, but to all of the governments which have 
entered into the process of transition during the past three 
years). 
  The second reason is represented by certain political 
relations with alternative political structures (because however 
much it might be based on a program, governance is carried on in 
a political context of balance). 
  The third reason consists of the social reactions, the 
expectations of the populace, and the characteristic feature at 
the level of current interests on the local level, on the macro 
level, and on the intermediate level. 
  A fourth reason is represented by structural challenges, 
such 
as inflation, prices, unemployment, resources, and the relations 
between consumption and production. 
  The fifth reason is represented by the exigencies of the 
foreign factor, on which depend foreign financing, regional 
equilibrium, national security in relation to spheres of 
influence, and so forth. The fact that these problems are seen 
as secondary by the present government is of less importance to 
us; they are important to the public interest, for Romania now 
and in the years to come. 
  [Varujan Vosganian] To return to Mr. A. Cornea's first 
question: There really is a nucleus, but we cannot bring it into 
the debate to the public at large, because that nucleus cannot 
be perceived merely by means of the common sense that Ilie 
Serbanescu was talking about. So, there is also a deeper level 
of theoretical approach which does not appear in our analysis. 
Here, however, we can see the first intermediate level--that is 
to say, the centers of obstruction, the centers of disruption, 
which owe their existence to procrastination. 
  We are trying to create an economic theory of transition, to 
discover concepts, to apply the concepts, and to create some 
general laws of transition. We have found pathological 
gradualism, we have found the allocation of resources to the 
necessities of transition, we have found the vicious circles of 
transition, and so forth. 
  [Dorel Sandor] Certainly, if we will acquire knowledge about 
these deep matters, it is not absolutely necessary that 
political options be modified as such. But here I would connect 
two planes: the evolution of political will during transition 
and the evolution of deep, systematic knowledge about 
transition. These are two planes which do not meet for the time 
being, and this is also the difficulty which I see as obvious in 
sending a particular message. I believe that one of the 
linchpins of political demagogy is truly the lack of political 
knowledge; nevertheless, I think that the chief moral support of 
the lack of political will is not necessarily the lack of 
knowledge, but rather a certain set of very active and very 
explicit interests. 
<H3>  The Government's Political Will Is To Maintain a Certain 
Kind of Electorate </H3>
  [Varujan Vosganian] State industry did not appear for state 
industry, but rather for the electoral support of those who work 
in state industry. What the present government wants (as did the 
previous governments) is to maintain a certain kind of 
electorate, the one tied to state industry, to state 
agriculture, and a part of the pensioners who are imbued with 
all sorts of nationalism, with "the young people of today," and 
so forth. This is an electorate which does not hold property, 
which cannot oppose the state and the arbitrariness of the 
state--in other words, a permeable electorate. It is precisely 
in this that the political will and the subversive and 
intentionally deceptive character of the government's actions 
consist. 
  [Valeria Pascariu] In what we theoretical economists are 
doing, let us not forget that reality is one step ahead of us; 
therefore, we should not fall into the sin of arrogance and 
imagine that the managing directors of private enterprises, or 
even of state enterprises, are people who, if we do not write 
down for them how to do marketing, do not know how to do it. 
  [Ioan Popa] The problem is that, in the reform strategy, 
many 
times people have made their choice of priorities because of the 
immediate circumstances, under the pressure of events; for this 
reason, certain instances of a lack of correlation have appeared 
in the creation and the putting into operation of the 
institutions and the mechanisms of the market economy. And I 
will give you an example from the field of finance and banking: 
A reform was carried out--I would say a radical one--as regards 
the banking system, without there being undertaken at the same 
time measures in the field of the capital market. This happened 
not because such measures would not have been provided for in 
the reform programs, but rather simply because they were delayed 
endlessly under the pressure of other measures. 
  If the law of privatization would have been respected, we 
would have had a stock exchange by now, and we would have been 
present in Business Central Europe with quotes from 
the Bucharest Stock Exchange; but we have no such thing. And 
that is not even on your list. 
  The securities exchange is the central institution of the 
capital market, just as the National Bank, the Bank, are the 
central institutions of the credit market, of the banking 
market. If people are not concerned with developing the capital 
market, then, inevitably, the entire financial and banking 
system will rely on the banks. The banks are thus put in a 
monopoly position. At least two reasons show how urgent it is to 
create a securities exchange: first off, the one that refers to 
the well-known problem of privatization, which is intimately 
tied to the existence of a capital market. And then, a 
securities market has here also the extraordinary ability to 
lend credibility to the reform measures. 
<H5>  What Laws the Government Is Sending Parliament </H5>
  [Victor Babiuc] I would like us to return to the causes of 
procrastination. It is certain that the idea of reform was not 
well received in all of the circles of power in Romania, neither 
in 1990, nor in 1991, nor in 1992, nor in 1993. But the obstacle 
was not localized in one place; one met with the obstacle in 
various places, because both in Romania and in other countries, 
there are several centers of power. And given that, up to 
September 1991, laws of a reformist nature (I will not comment 
on whether they were irreproachable or not) were sent over from 
the government to the Parliament, from September 1991 on these 
laws have been fewer and fewer in number. On the other hand, 
even up to September 1991, laws forwarded by the government were 
not entered into the parliamentary agenda, and this was not 
because of the government. 
  I will illustrate this with my personal situation: During 
the 
spring of 1991, I prepared all of the laws at the Ministry of 
Justice for the reform of Justice, and for the judges, and for 
the prosecutors, and for the notaries, and for jurisconsults, 
and for the carrying out of sentences and for other things; only 
the lawyers opposed my dealing with them. But out of all these 
laws, how many got onto the parliamentary agenda? One single 
law. And when? The moment the meeting of the ministers of 
justice of Europe and North America was being announced. Mr. Dan 
Martian realized, on my insistence, that it just would not do 
for me to go without any kind of bill having been put on the 
parliamentary agenda. And this bill concerning the 
reorganization of Justice passed through the Chamber of Deputies. 
  If we look at what has happened from then on, things are 
partially different: In the first place, the present government 
has sent Parliament the old laws, but those have also sometimes 
been changed for the worse. If we look at the period from 
November of last year through today, we see that very few 
important laws have made it onto the agenda. The state budget 
has gotten onto the agenda--it would not have been possible for 
it not to--and so did the laws about the reorganization of 
Justice, which had a certain deadline and which enjoyed a 
certain importance. The rest have been trivial matters. 
<H5>  Decentralization Without Denationalization and Vice Versa </H5>
  [Varujan Vosganian] Mrs. Pascariu brought up the problem of 
large industry, in favor of which there is an extraordinarily 
powerful lobby, whether at the governmental level, or at the 
level of parliamentary committees, or at the level of the 
politicians. Two things which come from socialism are being 
exploited, things which Romanian citizens are used to: the 
repeated nature and preservation of income, on the one hand, and 
the preservation of jobs, on the other hand. There are two 
distinct processes: One is decentralization, and the other is 
denationalization. We have done something very strange in 
Romania: We have carried out decentralization without 
denationalization, and we have carried out denationalization 
without decentralization. One time we carried out 
decentralization unaccompanied by privatization, and we carried 
out a privatization unaccompanied by decentralization. 
  [Calin Anastasiu] As Ilie Serbanescu was also saying, your 
list is at the common-sense level. It is probably somewhat above 
the level of common sense--it is a simple diagnosis, a census of 
problems. The question for you, for the group which has worked 
in this area, is: What do you have in mind as a follow-up to 
this? There should be a second step, an analytical step, which 
seems to me to be essential. 
  [Dorel Sandor] Our design is the following: In the first 
place, we have avoided mixing up the diagnosis with the 
solutions, because I have observed, after three years of 
activity in the structures of the executive branch, that there 
are many times when pseudo-solutions or modest solutions have 
inhibited a thorough analysis of the problems. So we wanted to 
establish a pertinent diagnosis which would be as objective as 
possible; we will probably wrap up this stage by the end of the 
year. At the same time, we believe that the problem of solutions 
is not merely of a technocratic nature. We want to throw into 
the political market several programs of political proposals 
which are now being redone, are being rearranged, in the 
structure of Authority as well as elsewhere. 
  As regards solutions, I believe that we could put together a 
collection of alternative solutions from three sources--first of 
all, at the local level. There is also an experience of 
tradition in East Europe with which we are already familiar to a 
great extent and which we could orient toward these problems; 
there is this permanently failed transfer of international 
experience--or diminished [as published]; and there is finally 
the great problem of the domestic political will to take on 
certain solutions. 
  One lesson of the technocrats of the past four years is that 
you can give very good advice to people who make decisions of a 
political nature, but it is not taken into consideration even 
the slightest bit. However, I do not believe and I will not fall 
into the trap of thinking that we must rush to hand out 
solutions in the sense of botching things up, because the great 
danger after a long period of waiting is for you to rush in to 
provide other unworkable solutions. 
<H5>  Why We Have Not Held a Dialogue Until Now </H5>
  [Mircea Diaconu] I am glad to hear that over there, high up, 
someone is really doing some thinking. However, I want to ask: 
When you were in the government and we were out shouting in the 
streets, why did you not tell us, too, that you were thinking so 
well? 
  I did some little experiments at my own expense: I went to 
the first bank that I came across and I asked for 200,000, not 
more, and this was when another government was in power, not 
this one. As I was saying, I asked for 200,000 and that was 
enough for me; I could not pay the first installment, because my 
first installment was greater than the amount of the whole loan. 
And then, to keep using the example of this same loan, I and my 
brother had put down as collateral everything we had in the 
house, everything we had accumulated over a lifetime. Shaken, I 
gave up, and I ceased any attempt to privatize myself or to do 
something myself. 
  We talk about the attempt to privatize yourself and, it is 
true, no one stops you. You are allowed to do this. You can do 
it in a field, at the entrance to the subway, wherever you 
want-- just so long as it is not in the great industrial 
strongholds. You cannot talk about privatization while thinking 
about some poor little kiosks. I am not thinking at all of 
selling off the "23 August" complex. It can stay there as a 
stronghold, for the kids to visit later on, as they would a 
Doftana. But the individual, the one who can start a business at 
a very small level, needs to be given an incentive, while the 
peasant has to have a scrap of paper which will make him feel 
that he is a landowner. And this is precisely what has not been 
done. And it is not only this government that has failed to do 
it; no one at all has done it. 
  And now I will come back with my question: Dorel Sandor, you 
were there in the government, you were important, you were 
powerful. What did you do there? 
  [Dorel Sandor] I would like to give three answers which will 
not agree with you very much. The first answer is that, in 
truth, I did work for two and a half years in the Victory 
Palace, as did, moreover, several other people here, and I want 
to say that our job there was to do these kinds of analyses of 
government. They were not disseminated because there is nowhere 
in the world where such analyses are made public. 
  However, the second reason that we did not carry on a 
dialogue such as we are now is the fact that we came into this 
building for the first time on 29-30 September 1991, invited by 
the GDS. Up until then, we were on your blacklist. Even though 
we remained friends all along, institutionally speaking we had 
no reason to be here until the Roman government fell. And at 
this point I want to touch on a certain sore spot of 
post-Decembrist Romania: The lack of professional solidarity 
among intellectuals after December is one of Romania's great 
tragedies; it is the fault neither of those of us who worked in 
the government, nor of those who did not work in the government, 
or who got there only recently. 
  The third answer is that, in truth, one of the great errors 
of the reform process in Romania is that it was done from the 
top down. Only now at the ground level have there appeared the 
true states of ferment of spontaneous reform, in which I believe 
very strongly. 
  [Andrei Cornea] I want to return to the subject of the 
position of the government towards the truth. I believe that the 
Authorities simply do not want to know the truth. It may well be 
that these technocrats never had political freedom of choice, as 
people say, but it is assumed that they know some things very 
well, that they understand them and can make a quasi-correct 
expert appraisal. Up until now, people have also said--and this 
is very well known--that many technocrats, experts, have made 
plans, have designed things, have made expert appraisals, but 
they have been disregarded, or they have been given very little 
weight. This is already a symptom which could be included in 
your list. It shows that the Authorities need a facade of 
expertise in certain fields, but that they do not intend to heed 
that expertise, and that finally this process ends with the 
gradual expulsion of these undesirables. 
<H3>  The Experience of a Team Made Up of People Who Have Been in 
the Government and People Who Have Been in the Opposition </H3>
  [Dorel Sandor] I would like to say one thing in order to 
prevent any confusion at this moment. We do not want to produce 
a bundle of stresses so that we will be called in after that to 
the Victory Palace and set to work, especially since many of us 
have been through that experience and have cured ourselves. 
Perhaps this makes the group "A future for Romania." And I want 
to draw a clear distinction between a political and ideological 
approach which tempts the Authorities with certain options, and 
a cool, systematic approach, from the perspective of the public 
interest. 
  What is very much missing in Romania now is not whether or 
not the Authorities want to carry out reform; Romanian society 
needs to tackle its problems in a relevant way, as if it were 
something normal. And Romanians are not to blame for not knowing 
still what is meant by the market economy. However, we, as 
experts, should very seriously pose ourselves this problem: that 
we should be able to offer Romanian society the common-sense 
facts in order for it to understand the real problems. We have 
made this list so that Romanian society will realize that these 
are its problems; this is our main objective, without any 
particular political orientation. 
  [Gabriel Andreescu] I would like to tell Mr. Sandor why our 
dialogue came later. In 1990, the newspaper AZI, which was under 
the leadership of the Front, was publishing attacks directed at 
the GDS and its members, in a kind of language that made it 
difficult to imagine any dialogue. 
  Now I would like to ask: In your analysis, what is the part 
with the description of phenomena, and what is the part setting 
out standards? A second point: From the concrete experience 
which you have had during the time of this analysis, please 
assess the margin between what is desired and what is happening 
by virtue of an internal dynamic. 
  [Dorel Sandor] I tried earlier to explain the five 
benchmarks 
which we take into consideration. What you say about their 
dynamic is interesting; in one of the preliminary propositions 
of this structure of scoring which we introduce into the 
database are earlier critical moments, a kind of case history of 
each problem. For example, this problem of the leu/dollar 
exchange rate, of the liberalization of the exchange rate, is a 
typical case in which we tried several times, we paid the price, 
we created the mechanism, up to a point. But after that we 
compromised that mechanism and we went, if not from zero, then 
perhaps even from before zero, through the damage we created. 
  Also, I agree, and it is a matter which concerns us, too: to 
what extent a problem is procrastinated on into a network of 
interests, of influences, of machinery of decision-making, and 
to what extent we are not talking about merely the quality of an 
individual, of his personal tendencies, but rather we are 
talking about a domestic political environment which has taken 
on shape and substance over four years in Romania. We have to 
take that environment into account, just as we should also take 
into account the determining influences of the industrial 
environment over the political environment, the commercial 
environment, and the environment which is tied to information 
and to culture. 
  However, I want you to observe that in this team, there are 
some people who have worked for four years in the structures of 
the executive branch, and there are others who have worked and 
continue to work in the structures of the opposition--true, all 
of them as technocrats. Thus, this team contains within it 
people who have experienced the problems from both directions, 
and this is, in my opinion, a precious thing. 
  [Mariana Celac] I would like to stick to the inertial part 
of 
the processes we are dealing with and the part exposed to the 
decisionmaking process, or political will, which is somewhat 
blurred in this first offering of the study. At least at the 
semantic level, the feeling is that all forms in which 
procrastination is manifested are exposed to a corrective 
decisionmaking which could eliminate this procrastination. I 
believe that here we are confronting an illusion in which both 
the Authorities and the journalism which writes "Authorities" 
with a capital "P" participate in equal measure. In truth, the 
force of decisionmaking and of the will on which it is based 
works very efficiently when you are close to moments of 
disturbance with an extremely wide range, when you are close to 
catastrophes. 
  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we are 
approaching a moment when the inertia of long-term and very 
long-term processes is becoming extremely important. I believe 
that whoever will be confronted in the future with the exercise 
of decisionmaking will have to deal with a phenomenon which is 
more and more dramatic--that is, that you may shoot at one 
target, but you may hit a completely different one. At that 
point you have to shoot in another direction, but you need to 
know where to aim. 
  The secret "arrogance" of this enterprise is that of 
decanting acts of solidarity, of differentiating between that 
which is long-term inertia, of perceiving what is becoming 
regional in our economic reality, and of defining, finally, what 
could be the area of decisionmaking, with all of those ricochets 
which a clearheaded Authority will need to handle so that, when 
it takes aim, it will hit the intended target. 
  [Traian Andronic (vice president, National Union Bloc)] I 
would like to refer to the moral aspect which you dispatched 
into an area having to do with corruption, with cover-ups, and 
so forth. I think that you should have taken this moral aspect 
somewhat more into account. You have two points there: One 
refers to the reform of Justice, and the other to labor 
legislation. To be concrete, one of the points refers to the 
existence of ambiguities in the resolution of labor conflicts 
through the law. Thus, this group of laws with a social 
character suffers from the very start from certain ambiguities 
which, practically speaking, make it impossible for the unions, 
for instance, to exercise the right to contest, to negotiate, 
and to strike. 
  How do morals function in this whole story, morals which 
have 
but one purpose--to ensure an ethical comfort which would lead 
to hope? Such an approach would relieve you, too, of the burden 
of a presumed inkling of populism in the statement which you 
made to the effect that reform has to start from the ground up 
(thus, with a moral earthquake) and not from above, the way it 
has happened.
