<F P=106> [Article by Augusto Grandi: "And in Ivrea a Pilot Project </F>
for Bioindustrial Activities"] 
  [Text] Turin. The bioindustrial science park of Canavese 
made its first steps yesterday in Ivrea. The Canavese 
Bioindustry Park limited company was established. Its founders 
include the RBM biomedical company, Finpiemonte (regional 
holding company), Federpiemonte, Assindustria Ivrea, Olivetti, 
the Turin provincial authority, and the municipal authorities of 
Ivrea and Colloretto Giacosa. The design and construction phase 
of the bioindustry park will take place over 1994-95 and in 1996 
the park will begin to manage the services that will be made 
available to the companies housed there. 
  The initial cost of the park is estimated to be 30 billion 
lire for 8,000 square meters of laboratories that will be made 
available to university researchers and private companies 
beginning in 1996. In the area located in the municipality of 
Colloretto Giacosa, on the outskirts of Ivrea, a staff of up to 
400 will be involved in activities related to the 
pharmaceutical, chemical, environmental, veterinary, food and 
agriculture, and medical sectors. Ivrea ensures that this is 
the first initiative of its kind in Europe with an entirely 
biotechnological vocation. 
  Europe is playing a fundamental role in the development of 
the park because 21 billion lire come from funds for projects 
promoted by the EU [European Union] for areas of industrial 
decline (which in Piedmont include the province of Turin and 
Verbano-Cusio-Ossola). The Canavese initiative is part of a 
second allocation of investments, to be made over 1995-96 and 
amounting to more than 583 billion lire to be divided between 
public and private projects for the two areas of Piedmont. 
  "In the first semester of 1994," said Industry Councillor 
for 
the Piedmont Region Giuseppe Cerchio, "the first phase involving 
an investment of 558 billion lire will be completed." The new 
projects concern a wide range of sectors, but special emphasis 
has been placed on technological innovation and the construction 
of science parks. "For this area," explained Cerchio, "the 
overall investment amounts to 53 billion lire, 37 of which come 
from EU, government, and regional funds while the remaining sum 
has been covered by promoting committees that have already been 
established and that include the municipal authorities, 
organizations, companies and private groups." The completion of 
the Lake Maggiore park, which began with the first part of the 
program has also been approved. 
  Funding will also be provided for a feasibility study on the 
Caselle aeronautical science park -- which the regional 
authorities will support in the future -- and the Canavese 
technology district will be approved. However, as far as these 
last projects are concerned, these are only the first steps 
pending other operational programs.

<F P=106> [Article by Vera Viola: "Parks, The South Starts With 10"] </F>
  [Text] Rome. Each region in southern Italy will have its 
science park and Campania will have two. Another two science 
parks will be established in the Lazio and Marche regions. In 
the coming months, work will begin on the construction of a 
total of 10 new parks that will join the two already in 
existence at Tecnopolis in Bari, and at Val Basento in 
Basilicata. The map of research centers in the central southern 
regions has been drawn up by the Ministry of Scientific 
Research, which has been assigned the task of enacting the 
interministerial agreement signed with the Ministry for Southern 
Italy and the Budget in 1990. Under the agreement 1.1 trillion 
lire will be spent on scientific parks in southern Italy. 
  The commission of experts at the ministry has chosen 10 of 
the 31 proposed projects for science parks that were presented 
in July 1992 plus two proposals that concern the development of 
initiatives already in existence. A plan per region, not only 
for those that are late developers, which come under the first 
goal, but also for areas of industrial decline such as Lazio and 
Marche, which come under the second goal. 
  "The decision to give each region its own structure may be a 
valid one," says Gianfranco Dioguardi, president of the science 
park Tecnopolis Novus Ortus in Puglia, "but I think it is 
necessary to have a sort of regulating plan. In short, when 
faced with the formation of so many parks, it is necessary to 
single out complementary areas of activity and create forms of 
coordination. It would be a serious error if, instead of making 
use of synergies, competition was to arise between the science 
poles." He added: "The job of coordinating scientific and 
research activities could be entrusted to one of the parks. We 
will have young structures and other more consolidated 
structures that could be the driving force." 
  Meanwhile the ministry has invited the bodies whose proposed 
projects have been selected to partly revise their plans, to 
correct them on the basis of precise guidelines, and to return 
them in the form of outline projects by 31 December. The rules 
to be followed were clear: To direct efforts toward applied 
research or toward the transfer of technologies to small and 
medium-sized companies and to establish close links with local 
businesses. And the restrictions were just as categoric: There 
will be no funding for basic research or for the purchase of 
machinery since other laws already provide incentives for this, 
or for the construction of megastructures. "We want to avoid 
funding more concrete," explains Giuseppe D'Addona, general 
manager of the science and technology department at the 
ministry, "instead we need to create links between the research 
structures that are already in existence and intensify 
relationships with companies." 
  The bodies whose proposals were selected have already 
delivered the outline projects, which have been revised and 
corrected as requested, to the ministry for its approval. In 
other words, the ministry will allocate the funding to carry out 
the plans. The ministry has undertaken to start the program 
during the first three months of this year. This means that 
after a long wait, the coming months will probably be decisive 
for the go-ahead to the parks. 
  APSTI (Association of Italian Science and Technology Parks) 
Secretary General Bruno Bottiglieri has said: "It is the 
ministry's turn. We have waited a long time, now is the moment 
to make up for lost time. But to tell the truth, the commission 
of experts that was set up by minister Colombo is finally 
working well and fast." 
  Meanwhile however, financial resources have become thinner. 
Of the 1.1 trillion lire that were initially planned for, only 
600 billion lire remain, the amount that should have been 
appropriated by the Ministry of Scientific Research under the 
1990 interministerial agreement, while funding for southern 
Italy has fallen through. In fact, the Ministry of Scientific 
Research has also had to work to identify the sources from which 
to draw the necessary resources: The first 300 billion will be 
salvaged from the fund for applied research under Articles 10 
and 3 of Law 46/1982, articles that have not been exploited to 
date. The first norm provides for the realization of research 
contracts based on projects submitted by companies, public 
bodies, and the public administration that will be stipulated by 
the IMI (Italian Institute for Financing Real and Personal 
Property). The other norm, Article 3, entrusts the Ministry of 
Scientific Research with the preparation of programs for the 
transfer of know-how and technologies to small and medium-sized 
industries. 
  In recent years there has been a growing interest in science 
parks all over Italy. Technology poles in all the other regions 
have been added to the science towns, Tecnopolis and the 
Lingotto, that have now become part of history. Today APSTI has 
17 members (see table), many of which have been established 
during the last three years and some of which are not yet 
operational. "If the agreement between the three ministries has 
been a driving force for the South," added Bottiglieri, "in the 
North the knowledge of the fact that parks are an efficient 
instrument for creating innovation, and perhaps the only really 
valid one, has undoubtedly become more diffused over recent 
years."

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Slowdown in Research at </F>
German Aerospatiale"] 
  [Text] The German aerospace research institution will 
eliminate 450 jobs and lay off the Federal Republic's five 
astronauts by 1996 
  The DLR (Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fur Luft un Raumfahrt) 
which is the central aerospace studies and research organization 
of the Federal Republic of Germany has just announced on 18 
November that as of next year it will dissolve the German 
astronaut contingent which included five members selected a few 
years ago, among whom were two young women, Heike Walpot and 
Renate Brummer, as well as three men: Hans-Wilhelm Schlegel, 
Ulrich Walter, and Gerhard Thiele. 
  The official reason given is lack of funding to maintain a 
pool of astronauts which is all the more pointless since "there 
are no longer any manned missions in the German space program," 
according to Walter Kroll, president of DLR. 
  Questioned at the same time by WELT AM SONNTAG, the young 
German Minister of Research, Paul Kruger (43 years old) declared 
however that manned space flights "are an option that should not 
be abandoned entirely" since "it is part of humanity." More 
particularly, the minister feels the need for attention "not to 
miss the boat" of the important Russian-American project for a 
future manned space station in orbit! 
  Mr Kruger also declared that he wanted to "develop the 
German 
budget and research program," and to do it "full steam ahead." 
Meanwhile, the president of DLR has announced that the 
organization's payroll will be slashed by about 10 percent--450 
people out of 4700--by 1996. Budget cuts were the reason given 
by Mr Kroll, the federal institution's funding having gone from 
650 M.DM in 1992 to 630 M.DM in 1993 with further cuts to 616 
M.DM planned for 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Discord in the Space </F>
`Alliance'"] 
  [Text] Fierce competition among satellite builders, 
particularly in telecommunications, has done nothing to 
strengthen the European industrial association. 
  The European space "Alliance" formed over one year ago 
between Aerospatiale, Alcatel Espace, Alenia Spazio and Deutsche 
Aerospace has not grown stronger with time. Quite the opposite, 
judging from some recent "episodes," which incidentally are not 
to be credited specifically to any one of the partners, but 
which raise questions about the true effectiveness of the 
association the four firms created to build civilian and 
military satellites, particularly for telecommunications. 
  For example, some express shock at what they call "the 
Artemis scandal"-- arising from the fact that Alenia Spazio is 
getting paid to develop a new 2.5 ton-class satellite platform 
instead of building the ESA's relay satellites (see A&amp;C No. 
1443), while the Alliance has in principle decided to 
standardize its platforms by opting for the Spacebus 2000 and 
3000 developed by Aerospatiale and DASA. 
  Another disagreement which is depriving some members of 
considerable financial support is the "absence" of Alcatel 
Espace--as well as of the major American partner Space 
Systems/Loral--alongside Aerospatiale and DASA, promoters of the 
Nahuelsat company which will take charge of building the Nahuel 
Argentine telecommunications satellite (see A&amp;C No. 1448). 
  Another similar occurrence is the "questioning" of the SS/L 
European partners who are still very reluctant to commit 
financially along with Loral for its Globalstar 
telecommunications satellite constellation project. 
  As a last incident (to-date), there is the unilateral DASA 
"initiative" to create together with China, a joint company to 
manufacture and sell telecommunications satellites and 
eventually observation satellites, a project which may (to a 
certain extent at least) compete with the Alliance's activities 
(see A&amp;C No. 1448). 
  The Alliance therefore has limits which a good grasp of 
commercial interest will not hesitate to cross. Thus, for 
example, Aerospatiale is again joining with Matra Marconi Space 
to build second generation weather satellites (MSG). 
  We are told that "this is a pragmatic decision. You don't 
replace a winning team." True, if you consider that indeed, in 
technical and operational terms, Meteosat is a model program. 
  The occasional partnership of Aerospatiale and Matra in 
space 
(as well as in missiles, with the Apache) is not in fact as 
surprising as it may seem: the two firms also collaborate on 
Helios, Eutelsat 2, and so on. It has even been pointed out that 
"Matra is both the prime customer and the prime supplier for 
Aerospatiale!" 
  All of this can be considered rather healthy, showing the 
adaptability and therefore the dynamism of satellite builders. 
But in that case, what is the use of an "Alliance"?

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Thomson-CSF Is Going to Buy Out </F>
Hughes Rediffusion"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Thomson-CSF [Thomson-General Radio Company] is 
getting to be the number-two manufacturer of civil aircraft 
simulators after CAE [computer aided engineering] and the 
number-one manufacturer of military simulators in England. 
  Unless we hear otherwise from the British and European 
commissions on competition, Thomson-CSF is going to buy out its 
rival, Hughes Rediffusion Simulation, before the end of the 
year. This is the result of the agreement signed last week 
between the French electronics combine and Hughes Aircraft. The 
agreement also involves two other subsidiaries: Hughes AMI, 
which manufactures simulated instrument panel instruments, and 
Hughes Rediffusion Simulation, Inc., which ensures marketing and 
after-sales service in the United States. On the other hand, the 
British training subsidiary, British Caledonian Flight Training, 
and Rediffusion's air control simulator operations are excluded 
from the agreement. 
  Based in Crawley near Gatwick, England, Rediffusion has 
never 
recovered from its heavy investments in the late eighties to 
launch a new series of civil aircraft simulators, "Concept 90." 
This warhorse had been completely rethought in order to optimize 
its maintenance and operation. But its designer, who relied on 
his position as the second largest manufacturer of civil 
simulators in the world and his 70 percent share of the visual 
display unit market, could not see the air transport crisis 
coming. The Canadian CAE, which is number one in the industry, 
could not see it either since it was enlarging its plant in 
Montreal at the same time to double its production capacity. 
  This was followed by a price war that caused prices to 
plunge 
25 percent and in the course of which CAE was struggling with 
modernized means of production while Rediffusion had to bear the 
burden of paying off its R &amp; D investments. In 1990 
Rediffusion 
staggered under the blow initially and laid off a third of its 
3,000 employees. At the end of last year a new restructuring 
plan resulted in the departure of 600 more employees. And a 
third plan is probably at present being prepared. All of these 
efforts have not enabled them to avoid the way out of a takeover 
by Thomson-CSF. 
  A Thomson-CSF that has a solid base established on the basis 
of the Airbus simulators and that benefits from that aircraft 
manufacturer's breakthrough. Thomson-CSF acquired a third 
position in the civil aircraft market in 1990 by buying out 
Link-Miles in England, one of the divisions of the Singer-Link 
empire, which was at the time dismantled by the raider, 
Bilzerian. Thomson-CSF knew how to profit from the joint 
ventures with its new subsidiary, which was operating in the 
Boeing markets. 
  We can no longer say as much for this new buyout. Because, 
in 
the meantime, Thomson-CSF and Link-Miles have developed a new 
visual display unit, "Space," for civil and military simulators 
and taken on the emergent market for FTD (flight training 
devices), instruction systems that are inserted between the 
computer-assisted learning unit and the flight simulator; two 
gaps in the market that the Rediffusion series addresses. 
  Louis Le Porte, who has been constantly insisting that there 
is an overcapacity of civil aircraft simulators since he took 
over control of the Thomson-CSF Training Systems and Simulation 
Division two years ago, is now directly confronted with the 
problem. Because the world market has been reduced to a small 
figure of about 20 units while CAE's capacity and Thomson-CSF's 
in its new field of operations is 45 simulators a year! 
  With this conglomeration of companies, Thomson-CSF has 
doubled its share of the civil flight simulator market, 
estimated at Fr3 billion. With 40 percent of all sales, it is 
behind CAE, which has captured 50 percent of the market. As for 
the military market, it essentially continues to be segmented by 
country. But in retaining Link-Miles and Rediffusion, 
Thomson-CSF becomes the biggest manufacturer of military 
simulators in England with nearly three-fourths of the market.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Guichardaz: "Voice/Data Networks: </F>
French-German Alliance"] 
  [Text] When they announced the creation of a new joint 
subsidiary designed to provide advanced telecommunication 
services to businesses worldwide, France Telecom and Deutsche 
Telekom further strengthened their ties. The draft agreement 
signed by Marcel Roulet and Helmut Ricke, the two groups' 
presidents, provides that both companies will own equal shares 
of the new entity, the name, legal form and capital of which 
still remain to be determined. In principle, it should be 
operational by 1995; by then, it should achieve sales of about 
10 billion francs [Fr] with 4,000 employees. 
  Its sphere of activity will extend from data network 
services 
(X.25, frame relay, etc.) to VSATs [very-small-aperture 
terminals], including international leased lines, international 
virtual private (voice-data) networks, and value-added services. 
From this point of view, the two partners will endow the joint 
venture, Telecom with the activities of Transpac and its 
European subsidiaries and with some parts of FCR [France Cables 
et Radio]; and Deutsche Telekom with Datex-P, the German X.25 
data network operator, and with other unidentified entities. 
  As for Eunetcom, the two operators' jointly-owned subsidiary 
dedicated to outsourcing for large multinational networks, "it 
is destined to be integrated into the new joint company under 
forms that remain to be defined," Marcel Roulet indicated, 
making a point of adding: "The new company will be in a position 
to offer services covering a single need of its clients, who 
will not necessarily be large multinational companies, whereas 
Eunetcom and its rivals, Unisource or Syncordia, aimed to take 
responsibility for all the telecommunication needs of very large 
clients." 
  For reasons of compatibility with Community law, consumer 
services--.e.g the centralization of international switched 
telephone traffic, and mobile communication services--are 
excluded from the alliance for the time being. Also excluded is 
Eucom, another joint structure working essentially in data 
interchange for the transportation and tourism sectors. 
  Nothing else is certain. "The announcement of this framework 
agreement has more to do with political management than with 
true business management where announcements deal with firmly 
established facts," Jean-Pierre Chamoux estimated, adding: "Per 
se, this agreement is good because it will enable the two 
operators to gain experience in the international sector while 
sharing risks. But, in the short term, they have nothing to 
oppose to third parties. Therefore, what is involved today is a 
pact rather than a true business project." As a result, many 
questions are being raised. The first one is that of the 
position of community authorities, whose green light is 
required. Preliminary contacts are said to have taken place 
between the two presidents and Jacques Delors, the European 
Commission president. "But the matter will be officially 
referred to Brussels only when our plans begin to materialize," 
Helmut Ricke stated. 
  Another pending question is that of the future of Transpac 
and its role in the new setup. "Transpac will be the French 
correspondent of the joint subsidiary, and its mission will be 
to harmonize operating policies with Datex-P," Marcel Roulet 
explained. But Transpac, which has a wide business experience, 
has invested a lot on the international market, contrary to 
Datex-P, a mere division of Deutsche Telekom which never 
ventured outside Germany. Besides, the French-German axis needs 
to be strengthened: first in Europe, where the two allies might 
pull along in their wake the Belgian operator Belgacom (the 
choice of Brussels as headquarters for the future company can be 
interpreted as a covert advance in this respect) and the Italian 
company Stet [Telephone Finance Corporation], which already 
worked with France Telecom in Argentina and wishes to expand on 
the international market; above all, in the United States, 
"where we must absolutely have a partner in order to offer a 
good range of services to our clients. Negotiations are in 
progress, in particular with AT&amp;T," Helmut Ricke 
acknowledged. 
  As for BT [British Telecom], the large European rival of the 
two national operators, the CEO [chief executive officer] of 
which, Ian Vallance, already denounced their alliance as 
anticompetitive to the extent that telephone services and 
infrastructures remain under a monopoly both in France and in 
Germany, will it go so far as to file a complaint with the 
Brussels Commission? At any rate, it is likely to try and obtain 
that the Commission increase its pressure on France and Germany 
to make them decontrol their infrastructures. 
<H5>  Services for Large Accounts </H5>
  Once united, the two partners' activities should yield a 
single line of products and services representing a "seamless" 
network offer, with genuine one-stop shopping--at least in 
France and Germany; at best in Europe--and centralized billing. 
  But uniting means changing, even relinquishing part of what 
already exists. First, cultural and organizational discrepancies 
between technical and management teams must be erased, as well 
as incompatibilities between interfaces, equipment, and 
management systems, and tariff differences, etc., so as to 
achieve a uniform offer. 
  Each type of service that has to be merged will bring its 
share of constraints. But the time and cost required for this 
integration should be reasonable considering the structural 
similarity of the products involved. Merging the Transpac and 
Datex-P packet-switching services should be easy. Through its 
German subsidiary, Info-AG, Transpac has acquired a solid 
experience. 
  In both cases, X.25 is the protocol used, the 64-bit segment 
is the billing unit. The frame-relay openings and protocols 
attempted on both sides remain marginal. 
  There remains to establish a direct interconnection system 
less expensive than the one used on the Transpac Europe network. 
Transpac already offers a single contract and single billing for 
international services at 1,000 francs [Fr] per month per 
contract, and Fr200 per month per gate per subscriber, with 
calls billed at Fr0.32 per kilobyte (Fr0.057 for local calls). 
In principle, the French-German X.25 connection should get more 
favorable tariff conditions already in 1995. 
  For the planned merger of international leased lines (LSI), 
conditions will be less favorable. Although France Telecom and 
Deutsche Telekom significantly lowered the prices of their 
national and international lines, the difference with operators 
such as C&amp;W or BT remains noticeable, especially in the case 
of 
the German company. The latter privileged its 64-kbps [kilobits 
per second] virtual line service on an ISDN [integrated services 
digital network] B-channel at the expense of traditional leased 
lines which are twice as expensive. 
  France Telecom announced that it will offer a similar 
service 
in 1994, under the label Transgroupe, to build virtual 
voice-data networks. By 1995, these two ISDN services may be 
interconnected! Transgroupe might replace Colisee International 
on the French-German axis, just as it is expected to replace it 
on Colisee Numeris. 
  Although conditional, the two national operators' intention 
to build an "Intelligent Network" on a joint platform confirms 
this trend.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Restructuring: Descarpentries </F>
Breaks up Bull into 12 Divisions"--first paragraph is 01 
INFORMATIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] Jean-Marie Descarpentries is restructuring Bull and 
strengthening its management. His priorities: to restore 
operational balance by the end of 1994, and to boost the 
manufacturer's sales. 
  Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who was appointed Bull's chief 
executive officer [CEO] a little over 30 days ago, decided to 
reorganize Bull's operations in 12 divisions (see chart): seven 
for products and services, four for sales (organized in regional 
networks), and one for the group's industrial operations. Each 
division is responsible for its results worldwide and in charge 
of the partnerships required for its development. As a result of 
this rationalization of operations, research and development, 
and probably marketing and communications as well, will be split 
among the various entities. The new structure still has to be 
ratified by customers who, among other things, wish to deal with 
a single entity. 
  The reorganization also separates Bull's various service 
activities, which has the advantage of making it easier to sell 
some high technology activities (such as artificial intelligence 
[AI], electronic data interchange [EDI], and micropackaging) or 
to assign them to future subsidiaries. The sale of Bull's 
in-house print shop is also being considered, as are the 
creation of a financial company and that of a logistics 
subsidiary. 
  In singular contrast with his predecessor's style, the new 
CEO has engaged in psychological warfare with the market to 
persuade his customers that Bull is going to change. Never mind 
that Bull's reorganization project had been in the making for 
several months already: it now bears the Descarpentries imprint. 
"Daring to change Bull," such is the management's new motto, and 
to prove that they mean business they put forward the men who 
will effect the change. Actually, these are the same men as 
before, except for Thierry Breton who was appointed special 
advisor to the president, in charge of strategy, and head of the 
FM [facilities management] branch. An odd appointment, 
considering that he is also advisor to Alain Madelin, the 
minister of business and economic development! 
  The group's new executive committee, renamed Bull Executive 
Board (BEB) for the occasion, will expand from nine to 11 
members. Besides Thierry Breton, the newcomers include Alain 
Couder, Charles Dehelly, and Herve Hannebicque; Albert 
Levy-Soussan and Jacques Weber are leaving, the latter being 
appointed to the strategy department. The "commando" men will be 
supported by the Bull Operating Council (BOC), an advisory board 
consisting of up to 100 members, to be appointed on 26 November. 
  This energy concentrate is expected to meet Jean-Marie 
Descarpentries' two challenges: to restore operational balance 
by the end of 1994, and to boost sales. In view of Bull's result 
for the first half of 1993 (1.98 billion francs [Fr] in net 
losses), this is a tall order, and one that will require 
overhauling the company's financial structure. 
  Thus, around mid-December, Bull is expected to call in some 
capital in order to reduce its debt from Fr9.45 billion to 
Fr2.44 billion. Although the State and France Telecom promised 
to pay respectively Fr8.6 billion and Fr2.5 billion, the other 
two shareholders, NEC and IBM, reserved their decision until the 
end of the year. According to the NIHON KENZAI SHIMBUM, Bull 
asked NEC to increase its participation (currently 4.4 percent). 
The information was not confirmed. 
  For the time being, the Bull CEO, who swore to improve the 
workforce productivity ratio (sales per employee amounted to 
Fr850,000 in 1992), will have to tackle layoffs and cost 
cutting. The management, which counted a net balance of 992 
departure under its 1993 "employment plan," will not cancel the 
2,850 layoffs planned in France by Bernard Pache; the program 
was implemented on 22 November. In addition, Jean-Bernard 
Pinatel (a member of the Bull Operating Council) was asked to 
prepare a plan to reduce non-wage costs.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Strategy: Bull Launches Strong </F>
Offensive in Facilities Management"--first paragraph is 01 
INFORMATIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] Bull displays European-scale ambitions in facilities 
management with the creation of a dedicated subsidiary, Athesa. 
It is also refocusing its activities in advanced technologies in 
an attempt to turn a profit. 
  Blitzkrieg, or swift and sudden warfare. While Bull's 
operational organization is taking shape, after the breakup of 
its activities into 12 divisions, Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the 
Bull CEO, sends his troops to storm the market. Fighting to 
restore operational balance by the end of 1994, he opens the 
game by creating a dedicated FM subsidiary and overhauling 
several leading-edge activities (AI and EDI). The State and 
France Telecom's contributions (Fr11.1 billion), two thirds of 
which is earmarked to pay off the manufacturer's debts, might 
also be used to promote development in sectors deemed buoyant. 
  The FM offensive is by far the strongest. Athesa, the 
structure just created, has Europe for its territory, and it 
ambitions to achieve sales of Fr3 billion within two years. Bull 
will therefore acquire 51 percent of the Athesa International 
holding, the remaining shares being divided among three French 
financial and industrial investors. Jacques Tordjman, former CEO 
of EDS France will be the president of Athesa International and 
its subsidiary, Athesa France. "The market is dominated by the 
Americans, but there may be a niche for a European group," he 
said. Within one month, he should have a full complement of 
shareholders, which he is negotiating with the help of Thierry 
Breton, the interministerial delegate to telecommuting who is 
now Bull's strategy manager and head of the FM division. The 
latter will consolidate the results of Athesa and Integris, the 
manufacturer's American FM subsidiary. Bulls maneuver in this 
sector is in every respect similar to that of IBM, which 
entrusted its FM activities to a subsidiary in order to 
strengthen Axone when it became its fully-owned subsidiary. 
  At the start, Athesa International will control three 
subsidiaries: Athesa France (a joint subsidiary of CISI 
[International Company for Data Processing Services] and Bull, 
owned 50-50); Athesa Technical Support &amp; Partners [Athesa 
TSP] 
(100-percent owned); and the Institute for New Technologies 
(100-percent owned). Foreign subsidiaries will be added 
progressively, starting probably with the United Kingdom, Italy, 
and Benelux. Athesa France should be worth Fr400 million, and it 
should bring together the activities of CISI Telematics (400 
people) and two Bull subsidiaries: Methods and Information 
Processing, and SSIG (i.e. 250 people and Fr180 million in 
sales). It will be headed by Claude Moireau, the current CEO of 
CISI Telematics, and it is designed to be a multiplatform 
company (CISI will contribute its IBM hardware and its contract 
with the CEA [Atomic Energy Commission], worth Fr70 million per 
year) and to cover all outsourcing services. 
  Next to it, Athesa TSP will be in charge of Bull's in-house 
data-processing activity (worth an estimated Fr500 million to 
Fr1 billion), and it will take over the data processing of the 
holding company's shareholders. As for the Institute of New 
Technologies, it will be in charge of training the personnel 
that Athesa will inherit when it takes over outside sites. By 
early January 1993, the holding company should be worth Fr1.2 
billion, for a market estimated at Fr4 billion in France and 
Fr10 billion in Europe. Jacques Tordjman, who claims paternity 
of this project of a European group using French capital, hopes 
to attract a clientele of French administrations. Apart from the 
Reunion of National Museums, administrations until now have been 
wary of subcontracting their data processing to outsiders. 
  While Bull has great FM ambitions, it is far more pragmatic 
in the field of advanced technologies. The Cediag, a body 
specialized in artificial intelligence, is now a full-fledged 
Bull subsidiary. According to Herve Yahi, the Cediag manager, it 
is dedicated to "solutions that make it possible to automate 
complex corporate functions" and will no longer develop 
software; software development will be subcontracted to 
outsiders. Reduced to a team of 60 for sales of Fr40 million, 
Cediag should be profitable by the end of the year. Finally, the 
computer-data exchange activity, the sale of which was mentioned 
by labor unions, will be assigned to Bull Engineering, a Bull 
France subsidiary.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Rose: "Outsourcing: Bull Subcontracts </F>
its Information Processing"] 
  [Text] Bull is taking the offensive on the FM market. With 
the division headed by Thierry Breton, the French computer 
manufacturer sets up a European structure dedicated to 
multiplatform outsourcing. Named Athesa International, it will 
become operational on 1 January 1993. It is a holding company in 
which Bull owns 51 percent of the capital, the amount of which 
was not made public. The remaining shares will be held by 
industrial or bank partners; their names will be known "by the 
end of the year," according to Jacques Tordjman, the former CEO 
of EDS France who is now president of Athesa International. The 
holding company will own a 50-percent interest in Athesa France 
(the other half being owned by CISI); Athesa France will bring 
together Bull's FM activities (its Methods and Information 
Processing subsidiary as well as the Groupama backup center 
running on GCos8 and managed by Bull) and part of Cisi 
Telematics. The SSII [data-processing services and engineering 
company] will also contribute its FM contract with the CEA on 
IBM and Cray platforms, i.e. the equivalent of Fr70 million per 
year. 
  Athesa France will have 650 employees (two thirds from CISI, 
one third from Bull) and is already worth about Fr400 million. 
At international level, Athesa will control 100 percent of 
Athesa TSP (Technical Support and Partners), which will manage 
Bull's data-processing centers (and those of the holding 
company's future partners) at European level, i.e. the 
equivalent of a contract worth at least Fr500 million. According 
to Jacques Tordjman, sales should reach Fr1.2 billion next year 
and Fr3 billion by 1995, with a 10 percent pre-tax margin.

<F P=106> [Article by J.G.: "Air France: 7 billiion F Deficit in 93, </F>
2000 Retirements in 94"] 
  [Text] Such a deficit would amount to more than twice the 
one that Groupe Air France had already declared on 31 December 
1992: 3.2 billion Fr. 
Will a deficit of nearly seven billion francs in 1993 be the 
figure which will balance the financial statement of the Groupe 
Air France on the next 31 December? It is still too early to say 
so with certainty but this is the figure which kept circulating 
at the outcome of the meeting held in Paris on 17 November 1993 
by the company's Board of Directors. This new figure is due 
partly to a complete stoppage at Air France last October (to the 
tune of about one billion francs, not counting the strike's 
impact on customer loyalty), and partly to the traditional drop 
in air travel at this time of year: Traffic for the first ten 
months of 1993 only grew by 0.3 percent compared to the same 
period in 1992. 
  To recover some dynamism for inadequate business, the 
company 
launched an extraordinary series of promotional "incentive" 
rates to some 25 destinations, which interested parties can take 
advantage of, under certain conditions of course. For his part, 
the new CEO was determined to create a new post of deputy 
director general for business, which went to Jean-Claude 
Baumgarten, a longtime company man. 
  The second general meeting for negotiations between 
management and the company's 14 unions was held on 22 November 
1993. In terms of social measures, next year should see 900 
"natural" retirements and 1100 departures due to negotiated 
early retirements. The Management Committee is scheduled to meet 
on 7 December, one week before the third general meeting which 
is expected to address the (delicate) question of overstaffing, 
which according to our colleague at L'HUMANITE represents at 
least 2000 jobs.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont, special correspondent in Plymouth: </F>
"British Aerospace Is Betting on Its Equipment"--first paragraph 
is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] In its global recentering strategy, BAe (British 
Aerospace) has spared its BASE subsidiary, which specializes in 
equipment. Quite simply because BASE already occupies a strong 
position in each of its special fields of operation. 
  It is within British Aerospace, an island that seems to have 
been spared by the interplay of mergers, conglomerations, and 
consolidaitons most of the aviation activities of this 
British-style industrial empire are currently plagued with. This 
haven of peace is called BASE, an acronym for British Aerospace 
Systems and Equipment, and it is a 100 percent subsidiary of the 
combine that specializes in aviation equipment. BASE employs 
1,100 people divided between its head office in Plymouth and 
Stevenage, the BAe's industrial center for missile operations. 
  At first glance, BASE's activities may seem to be fairly 
disparate and not particularly complementary to one another: 
motion detection and flight controls, navigation, optronics, 
radomes, accident recorders, and, lastly, secured 
communications. Actually, while these activities still appear to 
be very diversified, a sorting out process was effected as far 
back as two years ago. It led to a 30 percent reduction in force 
and the disappearance of a good many fields in which BASE did 
not possess significant capability. 
  Following these cuts, Nigel Randall, the general manager of 
BASE, retained only those special fields in which his company is 
viable and has its own potential for development. Because, at 
the British Aerospace level, BASE is a featherweight with its 
sales volume of about 50 million pounds sterling (Fr435 million) 
as against 4 billion pounds for the combine. And its activities 
quite obviously do not figure centrally in the combine's chief 
strategies. Therefore, Nigel Randall has to run his company like 
an independent business that must find its own markets, clear a 
regular profit margin, and be able to finance itself. 
  With regard to its main specialty, motion detection and 
control surface activators, Nigel Randall presents BASE as the 
bigges European manufacturer of gyros, an activity fostered over 
the years by equipping the missiles produced by the parent 
company. The company also inherited the activities of Sperry GB, 
taken over in the mid-1980s, and has developed its own 
fiber-optic gyrolaser and gyrometer techniques on the basis of 
those activities. With 60 of its LINS 300 gyro units produced to 
date (see box), BASE, along with Sextant Avionics, is currently 
the only European manufacturer to mass produce inertial 
gyrolaser units. These gyro units have already been delivered 
installed on British Aerospace aircraft, the Hawk 100 and 200s, 
but also on the Anglo-Italian EH-101 helicopter and on the 
F-5retrofits in the Near East. 
  In its second special field, navigation, BASE has developed 
a 
digital cartography system, Terprom (terrain profile matching), 
which has been retained by the U.S. Air Force on its F-16s. 
Based on a Mil-Std-1750A processor, this equipment makes use of 
the digitized terrain that it has in its memory bank and the 
soundings of the radio altimeter to re-erect the aircraft's 
navigation system with an accuracy range of 40 meters. To date, 
Terprom has racked up over 700 sorties, 500 of them on the F-16. 
  The third special field: optronics, in which BASE has 
developed Autotrack, a video gyrocompass ball with truly 
universal capabilities since it can be found mounted on surface, 
naval, or airborne platforms, as the core of fire-control units 
for the Rapier 2000 ground-to-air and Swingfire antitank 
missiles, the Sea Archer naval antiaircraft cannon, and, lastly, 
GEC-Marconi's new TIALD laser designation pod. 
  BASE's fourth special field, radomes, was also developed 
with 
British Aerospace missiles. So, naturally, this activity was 
established in Stevenage. BASE produces radomes for the whole 
possible range of carrier speeds: from polyester radomes for 
transport aircraft to the ceramic radomes of multiple-mach 
missile via epoxy for supersonic aircraft and polyimide for 
missiles. 
  With regard to BASE's fifth special field, accident 
recorders, Nigel Randall pointed out that there has never been 
any reason for complaining that their recorders ever lost any 
data during a crash over 30 years of service. Today, 15 
different types of aircraft are equipped with BASE recorders, 
from the old Vickers VC-10s to the latest Tornados. 
  The sixth and last field is secured communications. 
Classified under this field, we find products as diverse as HF 
and VHF antennas, interface modules for the Mil-Std-1553, Stanag 
3910, Arinc 429 and 629 buses, and, lastly, the MPS2000 secured 
air freight system that the Royal Air Force has just ordered. 
  BASE has today reached a turning point in its development. 
Having for a long time made a living form markets overlooked by 
its combine, the subsidiary is now turning resolutely toward the 
competitive market. For example, it has been smart enough to 
develope ceramic accelerometers and gyrometers that are 
cheap--but capable of withstanding acceleration forces of up to 
10,000 Gs--for Merlin mortar shells. Toward the end of this year 
1,000 m[.sup]2[/] of surface area provided with precision 
machines were allocated for the production of these sensors at 
the Plymouth plant, which enabled them to step up the production 
rate to 100 units a month. Today, plans are ready for increasing 
the pace to 100,000 a month by three years from now to tackle 
the automobile market through the Japanese Sumitomo combine, 
with which BASE is discussing the venture. 
  The marketing of radomes is competitive. The successes 
recently recorded outside the parent company prove it: radomes 
for the Eurofighter 2000, the Brazilian AMX, the Catrin d'Agusta 
helicopter for battlefield surveillance, and the Pakistani 
Mirage III and Singapore F-5 retrofits. This led BASE to open a 
shop this year for repairs on radomes for Boeing 737 and 767s in 
addition to the work it already had with the BAe 125 and 146s. 
To get next year off to a start, BASE is putting a new 
generation of static memory recorders on the market which 
combine in the same housing the recording of conversations and 
of aircraft parameters (A &amp; C No. 1448). The idea being to 
install two identical combined recorders per aircraft to ensure 
total redundance of recordings and to ward even farther off the 
risks of loss of data in the envent of a crash. BASE provides 
thehardening of its recorders against crashes and has formed a 
partnership with the Japanese firm, Kokusai, which supplies the 
memory units and, in return, permits the British company to have 
access to the Japanese Air Force market. 
  As we can see, Nigel Randall is not lacking in projects for 
his company. But, declining to divulge overly many figures when 
he was questioned, he contented himself with asserting his very 
great confidence in the future of his company, whose sales, 
according to him, should show a growth rate higher than 50 
percent over the next few years. 
<H5>  Box: British Aerospace Bridgehead in NH90 </H5>
  It is not easy for a British equipment manufacturer to 
establish himself in a program in which England is not 
participating. Let's not make ourselves out to be angels; the 
reverse is probably also true. And yet, this is the challenge 
that Andy Parritt, who is in charge of BASE sales, has set 
himself for his LINS 300 inertial gyrolaser unit, which he wants 
to install in the NH90, a French-Italian-German-Dutch helicopter 
program. 
  Nevertheless, Andy Parritt is not acting rashly and he 
carefully evaluated his chances of success before launching on 
this venture. For him, the NH90 no longer resembles past joint 
programs. In those programs political considerations blocked the 
interaction and forced them to divide up the tasks among the 
member states, sometimes even at the most elementary levels. 
Andy Parritt is familiar with this situation: His company shares 
the building of the Eurofighter radome with an Italian partner, 
Alenia, a Spanish partner, INTA [National Institute for 
Aerospace Research], and a German partner, DASA [German 
Aerospace] (ex-TST). And his gyrolaser unit has not been 
retained for this same aircraft in order to redistribute the 
responsibilities to Italy, to the advantage of a unit to be 
supplied by Lital--but whose gyros are to be manufactured by 
Litton in the United States! As concerns the NH90, on the other 
hand, the distribution of responsibilities among the states was 
effected at the higher level to leave more room for the training 
of the teams that are candidates for the program. And this was 
done in the name of a certain measure of economic efficiency, 
necessary under the circumstances because they will have to be 
able to offer the helicopter on the more competitive civil 
aircraft market. 
  Thus Andy Parritt draws the conclusion that he has been 
offered a chance. His LINS 300 unit is credited with existing in 
a version that was developed for the EH-101 helicopter, whose 
basic missions (antisubmarine warfare and search and rescue) are 
similar to those of the naval NH90. These missions are the most 
demanding from the point of view of navigation and they will 
determine the dimensions of the future European helicopter's 
guidance systems. Thus Andy Parritt explained that his gyro unit 
could be adapted to the NH90 specifications at a lower cost. 
  Specifically, BASE has developed some functions for the 
EH-101 that are particularly appreciated for a naval helicopter. 
Thus the LINS 300 is capable of aligning itself in flight by 
automatically re-erecting itself on the basis of data from the 
GPS [global positioning system] or the Doppler radiosonde, over 
water as well, which makes it possible to take off from land by 
shunting the few minutes normally required to complete an 
alignment or at sea without any special device for loading the 
ship's reference data into the helicopter's computers. This ease 
of operation of the LINS 300 does not, nevertheless, compromise 
its accuracy, which reaches the 0.2 mark, thus allowing the 
helicopter to in flight designate to its carrier vesselits 
objectives on the surface of the water so that it can adjust its 
guns. 
  Andy Parritt confided to us that he is right now finalizing 
a 
partnership agreement with a French specialist in navigation. 
Contacts have also been made with Eurocopter France at a higher 
level. Even if the struggle is not an easy one for Andy Parritt, 
the combine to which he belongs is already offering the Tiger, 
in a joint venture with Eurocopter, in the British call for bids 
for an attack helicopter. 
  In the event this bid is successful, BASE's presence in the 
NH90 program would be a ready-made occasion for a round of 
compensations which Her Majesty's government would not fail to 
demand. So Andy Parritt has decided to try his luck.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Strategy; Bull: IBM Backs Out; </F>
NEC Increases Its Commitment"] 
  [Text] Bull has enjoyed varying fortunes with its 
shareholders. Whereas the State (72.03 percent of the capital), 
France Telecom (16.17 percent), and NEC (4.43 percent) promised 
to follow the manufacturer's recapitalization, IBM (5.68 
percent) for its part refused to do so. The U.S. company chose 
to wait and see and backed out, determined to postpone any 
additional investment until it has a better picture of the 
French manufacturer's business development. On the other hand, 
specific industrial partnerships are contemplated. The two 
manufacturers decided to accelerate the implementation of the 
projects launched in 1992, in particular those involving RISC 
[reduced instruction set computer] technologies. IBM's financial 
disengagement is bad news for Bull, for which private investors' 
contributions give credibility and validity in Brussels to those 
made by public shareholders. Besides, Bull did not wait for the 
European Commission's assent to set the terms of its 
recapitalization at a board meeting held last Wednesday. The 
State agreed to make its final contribution (7 billion French 
francs [Fr]) during 1993 and 1994. During the same period, 
France Telecom will contribute Fr1.572 billion (in addition to 
the Fr458 million granted at the beginning of 1993). The 
operator's interest in Bull should increase to 17 percent, while 
IBM's will decrease. In addition, the manufacturer held a 
general meeting of shareholders to approve a capital increase 
that should help it reduce its debt from Fr9.4 billion to Fr2.4 
billion. In a different context, early in December, Bull and NEC 
signed a letter of intent aiming to strengthen their ties in the 
fields of computers, components, and telecommunications. 
Continuing their collaboration in large systems, they should 
also extend it to microcomputers. Moreover, NEC should become a 
privileged supplier of Bull for active-matrix color displays, 
ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits], and DRAMs 
[dynamic random-access memories]. Bull will also help the 
Japanese company market communication systems such as VSATs 
[very-small-aperture terminals] and identification systems using 
fingerprints.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Manufacturers: Third Year of </F>
Losses for SNI-France"] 
  [Text] After experiencing losses for three successive 
years, and with sales that have remained stable (at 1.8 billion 
French francs [Fr]) since its creation in October 1990, 
Siemens-Nixdorf France [SNI] continues its restructuring, hoping 
to achieve operational balance in 1994-1995. 
  Although it set up three lines of development already in 
1991 
(open systems, microcomputers, and migration solutions), 
SNI-France still fails to derive any benefit from its strategy. 
At the end of September, the French subsidiary closed its 
1992-1993 fiscal year with a net loss of Fr446 million, which 
includes an operational loss of Fr201 million (exclusive of 
restructuring costs). In 1991-1992, the operational loss was 
Fr236 million. According to Kurt Hollederer, general director of 
SNI-France, last fiscal year's results are "in line with 
objectives," even though 506 employees were laid off over two 
years, and they led him to forecast a net loss of Fr400 million 
in 1993-1994. The company now employs 1,675 people, compared 
with 2,497 in 1990. 
  Contrary to its competitors, SNI, which relies on the 
industrial stature of its parent company, Siemens, does not 
attempt to expand its service activities. "Taking on the SSIIs 
[data-processing services and engineering companies] is of no 
great advantage," according to Kurt Hollederer. Thus, SNI-France 
will engage in system integration only as far as hardware is 
concerned (excluding application programs and networks) and it 
will get involved in facilities management only if it has a 
partner. More than ever, its marketing policy is geared to large 
accounts, leaving small to mid-size companies to a network of 
partners. 
  The better to attack its market, the French subsidiary was 
just reorganized into five divisions, which become profit and 
loss centers. Located in Haubourdin, the microcomputer division 
achieved sales of Fr 645 million in 1992-1993, including Fr385 
million in France, with 20,000 units sold. Other product 
divisions are in charge of high-performance printers (450 units 
installed in France, 7,000 worldwide) and point-of-sale 
terminals. In addition the division in charge of customer 
service (customer support and mixed hardware-base management) 
becomes one of SNI's five European support centers. As for the 
fifth entity, it is an expertise center dedicated to R/3, the 
management package running under Unix developed by the German 
publisher SAP, with which SNI has formed a strategic partnership.

<F P=106> [Interview with French Minister of Civilian Space Gerard </F>
Longuet; place and date not given: "The French Space Industry 
Needs an Experimental Telecommunications Satellite"] 
  [Text] Exclusive interview with Gerard Longuet, Minister of 
Industry, of Post Office and Telecommunications, and of Foreign 
Trade. AIR &amp; COSMOS interviewed Gerard Longuet, Minister of 
Civilian Space in France on new European and French initiatives 
starting with the experimental telecommunications satellite 
recommended by Yves Sillard, a program the French minister wants 
to decide on and start up in 1991. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are your priorities for Europe? 
  [Longuet] My first concern is to confirm the missions of 
Ariane 5 to get the favorite launcher of the Europeans for their 
programs but also for European participation in the future 
international orbital station prepared by the United States with 
Russia. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] So, you are in favor of participating in 
this station? 
  [Longuet] That would be reasonable to say. When it comes to 
inhabited infrastructure, you could not really run three of 
these operations centers in the United States, in Russia, and 
Europe. There are thus some economic and political virtues to 
this cooperation, because that would permit substantial savings 
and would promote the process of modernization in Russia. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What part could Europe play in that 
project? 
  [Longuet] I should hope that Europe would be a major partner 
because manned flights are an important objective for the 
future. Europe should, as a matter of priority, make 
contributions in kind, first of all, for the construction of the 
international space station and then during the operations 
phase. The accent should particularly be placed on freight 
transport, in other words, equipment for logistic support. On 
that score, Ariane 5 should be picked as one of the bases for 
European contribution to the future international station. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are the other possible 
contributions? 
  [Longuet] In that context, Europe must contribute something 
indispensable, something that is targeted toward its strong 
points. Ariane 5, of course, stands in the foreground; we will 
be involved in the Columbus manned laboratory module and our 
effort can be concerned with logistic support for the station. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Have the French and Germans finalized 
their work on the engine? 
  [Longuet] My, what a negative attitude! Those two countries 
are and will continue to be the two foremost contributors to ESA. 
  I see my colleague Kruger (Minister of Space) frequently and 
he is trying to work out maximum consensus in Germany. Our 
common objective is to arrive at an agreement on the 
international space station as soon as possible. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Can we look forward to a decision on the 
major European projects when the ESA board meets in 
December? 
  [Longuet] It may be a little bit too early to finish the 
whole thing off. Moreover, conditions for association under the 
international space station project in Europe have not yet been 
finalized. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Is there no way to get the new European 
projects off the ground to avoid having to send the teams of 
specialists home? 
  [Longuet] French funding has been going up. In 1994, we have 
a substantial increase of more than 7%. It is primarily 
oriented toward European programs. Besides, we now have joint 
financing with Ariane 5 that will make it possible to complete 
the program and put the rocket in operation in 1996. 
  AIR &amp; COSMOS] Might we also look forward to more 
powerful models and/or small launchers? 
  [Longuet] Before we can push the development of Ariane 
5--something we are now thinking about--the manufacturers have 
to win the battle of price competitiveness! 
  I asked the CNES [National Center for Space Studies] to 
analyze the situation and to let me have some proposals for 
small launchers. The analysis would have to consider domestic 
and European industrial capabilities and, beyond that, there 
would have to be a market estimate, also considering 
requirements for small scientific, military, or 
telecommunications satellites. The report should be forwarded to 
me early in 1994. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What is your interest in manned 
programs? 
  [Longuet] For the government, man in space is not an end in 
itself. My priorities--that were picked by the government 
meeting in Cabinet last year--deal with practical applications: 
telecommunications, observation, and weather. Activities of a 
technological bent are also being pursued constantly. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are the prospects for 
telecommunications and observation? 
  [Longuet] I find that, looking at telecommunications, where 
we have a growing tendency toward the numerical expression of 
images, there is a heavy demand for transmission capacities, 
pointing to the need for launching Telecom 2C within a year and 
building Telecom 2D for launch in 1996. 
  This telecommunications demand can be handled commercially, 
and hence, commercial operation (other than amortization) of 
observation satellites is well balanced. Telecom and Spot thus 
are two very powerful practical application programs. These are 
two priorities for French space policy, and I see no reason why 
we should give preference to one over the other! Space 
communications constitute an important market and space 
observation is part of our sovereignty. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] When will you decide on the next 
Spot? 
  [Longuet] Pursuing the Spot and Helios national space 
satellite programs is a matter of prime importance. A 
combination of efforts in the construction of civilian and 
military satellites will be perpetuated for the next generation 
of satellites, that is, Spot 5 and Helios 2, which the 
government will have to decide before the end of 1994. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What does the "Sillard Report" do for 
telecommunications? 
  [Longuet] Our efforts on telecommunications dropped to less 
than 2% of the CNES budget. Now, that sounded an alarm 
signal 
for us! 
  Early in July, I therefore asked Yves Sillard to get a 
brainstorming group together, including the principal operators 
in the field, in industry and the administration, to let me have 
some proposals for correcting the situation. 
  Yves Sillard sent me his report recently. It already has the 
great merit of being drawn up on a basis of consensus, both as 
regards industry (with the association of the three main firms 
concerned, that is to say, Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale, and 
Matra Marconi Space) and the government since it gets France 
Telecom, DGA [General Delegation for Weapons], DGAC [General 
Directorate of Civil Aviation], DGSI [Directorate General of 
Industrial Strategies], and CNES together. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are you going to do about that 
report? 
  [Longuet] Yves Sillard recommends building and launching an 
experimental satellite to try new technologies out in orbit, 
such as ion power, "active" antennas (with electronic scanning), 
or on-board switching. I certainly agreed to that objective. The 
nation's space industry does need an experimental 
telecommunications satellite. 
  That is a good basis for embarking on a national program 
that 
will rally the three manufacturers under the direction of CNES 
and that would also be managed in association by France Telecom 
and DGA. 
  I think, however, that the project can or should be open to 
European participation from the beginning. 
  But I should hope that France would retain a role as major 
organizer. And, above all, I would hope that CNES would draft a 
specific satellite project that I could then submit to the prime 
minister in the spring of 1994. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] How will this project be financed? 
  [Longuet] The Sillard report calls for sharing between CNES, 
which would hold the preponderant part, as well as France 
Telecom and DGA. The whole thing would have to be finalized 
during the next few months so that the development of the 
experimental satellite could be started before the end of 1994. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Would that be an occasion for going 
further in the reorganization of French space industry? 
  [Longuet] That looks a bit premature to me. I support the 
reorganization initiatives aimed at a consolidation of the 
European space industry to boost its competitiveness, such as 
the efforts undertaken by Matra Marconi Space with British 
Aerospace or by Aerospatiale with German Aerospace. I do not 
want to force any solutions on the manufacturers concerned. I 
can go along with or facilitate what they propose, but it is up 
to them to take their responsibilities. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] How will the French space budget 
develop? 
  [Longuet] I have been trying to get the new administration 
to 
give priority to the CNES budget. Program allocations went up 
slightly for 1994 with a figure of Fr8.4 billion; but above all, 
there has been a substantial increase in funding with a figure 
of Fr8.2 billion. I have been wanting to make up for the rather 
considerable lag on the part of our predecessors when it comes 
to payments to industry. This course correction will go on 
throughout 1994 and will probably also extend into 1995. 
  In the future, however, we must no longer think in terms of 
two-digit growth, which nobody predicted anyway. 
  I thus expect the French space establishment (manufacturers, 
operators, major research organizations, etc.) to propose to me 
an ambitious long-term but financially realistic plan. Under 
these conditions, I would fight to get those programs through, 
be they domestic or multilateral! 
<H5>  Space--A Place for Technological Excellence </H5>
  "For France, space is one of its principal points of 
technological excellence, synonymous with jobs and exports," 
emphasized Gerard Longuet. He noted that "this is why the prime 
minister wanted to put this strategic activity under the 
Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade which has become 
responsible for the civilian space budget. The old General Space 
Directorate has been attached to my ministry within DGSI 
(Directorate General of Industrial Strategies)." The 
interministerial character of space was furthermore maintained 
since Gerard Longuet shares oversight over CNES with his 
colleagues Francois Leotard and Francois Fillon, ministers of 
defense and of research, respectively. 
  "That is no problem," as far as Gerard Longuet is concerned.

<F P=106> [Speech by UK Science Minister William Waldegrave on 11 </F>
February 94, place not given: "Withdrawal of Gene Patents Good 
For the UK"] 
  [Text] The withdrawal of patents for cDNA sequences for 
unknown functions will encourage further research into this 
important area, separating the exploratory research phase from 
the exploration phase, Mr Waldegrave said today. 
  He was speaking following today's decision by the Medical 
Research Council (MRC) and the US National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) to withdraw their patent applications for cDNA sequences 
of unknown function, filed in 1991. 
<H5>  Mr Waldegrave said: </H5>
  "The MRC and NIH patent applications were filed in order to 
protect the interests of the UK and US taxpayers, with least 
damage to the international research effort in genome mapping 
which requires the free flow of information. 
  "However, The Medical Research Council, with the support of 
the Government, has always argued that these applications should 
not be granted. I welcome the co-operation between the UK and 
the US on this important issue and look forward to further 
developments in this important area of research." 
  This announcement backs up MRC's decision in October 1993 
not 
to file any further patent application on newly-obtained cDNA 
sequences of unknown function unless accompanied by knowledge of 
the gene function. 
<H5>  Sir Dai Rees, Secretary to the MRC said: </H5>
  "We feel this withdrawal of the patents is a correct step, 
and we are delighted to be able to co-ordinate our actions with 
those of the NIH."

<F P=106> [Article signed Pierre Rajot: "Regulation And </F>
Standardization Of Biotechnology"] 
  [Text] The application of European regulations in France 
completes an arsenal of already well-established measures. 
Cooperation and reflection are required to see this complex 
work, covering laws, procedures, and standards, through to a 
successful conclusion. We will take an overview of the 
situation. 
  The three European directives issued in 1990 required the 
implementation in France of new legislative, regulatory, and 
standardizing measures and, in certain cases, modifications and 
additions to the existing set of measures designed to protect 
man and the environment from biological risks. 
  For them to be included in French law, the authorities 
judged 
that directive 90/679 on worker protection could be applied in 
the context of a major addition to the Code du Travail [Work 
Code], and that directives 90/219 and 90/220 should be applied 
by a law adopted by parliament and enacted on 13 July 1992. The 
European Community moreover required that a set of 56 standards 
accompany the application of the directives to cover genetic 
engineering (90/219 and 90/220). 
  In this article we will therefore examine the situation of 
these three aspects: work regulation, the law on biotechnology, 
and European standardization. 
<H5>  Work Regulation </H5>
  Directive 90/679 is thus to be applied in France through the 
Work Code which will receive a major new section. Very soon, a 
decree will create "a section seven to the first chapter of 
section two of book two of the Work Code" entitled "Prevention 
of Biological Risk." After the definition of certain terms and 
the classification of biological agents into four groups -- the 
first containing agents that are not dangerous for man and the 
other three grouping dangerous agents by degrees of harmfulness 
-- the decree will provide, in subsection two, general rules for 
the assessment and prevention of biological risk. Subsection 
three will stress the requirement for training and dissemination 
of information. Subsection four will list provisions specific to 
certain activities (medical, funeral, and veterinary 
establishments, medical biology laboratories, industrial 
processes using pathogenic biological agents, etc.). Lastly, 
subsection five will deal with the medical monitoring of exposed 
personnel and the duties of the work medical service. This 
decree should come into effect before the end of 1993. 
<H5>  The Law of 13 July 1993 </H5>
  This law is intended to regulate research, training, 
development, production and marketing operations relating to 
genetically manipulated microorganisms and organisms (GMM's and 
GMO's). It is based on existing structures which it further 
strengthens: the genetic engineering commission, charged with 
establishing the danger criteria for genetic constructions, 
assessing projects, and prescribing confinement measures; and 
the commission for the study and dissemination of the products 
of biomolecular engineering, termed biomolecular engineering 
products, which is charged with studying each specific R&amp;D 
project and project stage operating in an unconfined 
environment, and which issues an opinion prior to the marketing 
of the product. 
  Both commissions send their opinions to their parent 
ministries, the government ministers being the only authority 
empowered to authorize and prescribe safety provisions or to 
refuse an R&amp;D operation. 
  The two decrees formalizing and defining the missions of 
these two commissions were published in the Official Journal 
[OJ] on 30 January and 24 February 1993. The two orders 
detailing their respective contents were also published in the 
OJ on 9 February and 22 May 1993. The commissions will continue 
to examine all dossiers submitted to them, as they have been 
since 1975 and 1986 respectively. In addition, the law 
distinguishes training and R&amp;D work from production and 
marketing operations. 
<H5>  Research And Development </H5>
  The decree of 27 March 1993 stipulates that R&amp;D units 
and 
study projects, whether public or private, must be approved by 
the research ministry after the genetic engineering commission 
has given its opinion. Operations already underway must have 
been submitted for approval by way of a form drawn up by the 
order of 9 June 1993 which must have been sent in before the 
limit date given in the above-mentioned decree, i.e. 27 
September 1993. Theoretically, all operations already underway 
that have not been indicated by this date are illegal and fall 
into the new operations category. New operations, before any 
work can begin, must request approval on the basis of a dossier 
which must follow the guidelines laid out in an as-yet 
unpublished decree. It is hoped that this legal vacuum that has 
existed since 27 September 1993 will be quickly filled. 
<H5>  Production </H5>
  The law states that the production of GMM's and GMO's will 
be 
regulated by the law of 1976 relative to installations 
classified for reasons of environmental protection. No decree 
or order has yet been published, since the insertion of this new 
section into this law poses a number of problems which could 
have repercussions for the whole industry. 
  For the time being, the administrative control of production 
starting with genetically manipulated micro-organisms is done 
according to heading 58 paragraph 11 of the list of classified 
installations. 
<H5>  Marketing </H5>
  In this case, too, the vertical, sectorial marketing 
regulations (agricultural products, human or veterinary medical 
products, etc.) are being or will be progressively altered. A 
regulatory measure should gather up those subjects that are not 
covered by any vertical regulation. 
  This, then, is a brief summary of the current situation of a 
regulation that is progressively being inserted into structures 
that -- fortunately -- already exist. We can only hope that the 
internal discussions currently underway lead us to solutions 
enabling the safe, problem-free, non-delayed, and effective 
application of the new biological technologies, based on the in 
vitro manipulation of DNA and which are grouped together under 
the heading of biotechnologies. 
<H5>  Standardization </H5>
  Well before this avalanche of Community and national 
regulations -- under the direct auspices of the chairman of the 
interministerial group for chemical products attached to the 
prime minister's office and the ministry of industry -- France 
had already begun to implement several tens of standards. 
  For public and private operators, the application of these 
standards -- which can be revised depending on the development 
of knowledge and in consultation with the commissions on genetic 
engineering and biomolecular engineering -- has enabled France 
to make quite spectacular strides in biotechnology, and in 
complete safety. 
  In the field of agriculture alone, for example, between 1986 
and 1992 France was able to set up more than 150 on-site 
experimental projects, behind the United States which had begun 
some 300 experiments out of a total of 600 being conducted 
worldwide. 
  In the context of its own standardization policy, the 
European Community wanted to push ahead with the establishment 
of standards on a European scale. A more theoretical and less 
pragmatic discussion than that made several years earlier in 
France led to a 54-standard project being devised along the 
themes taken up in certain chapters of the French Standards 
text, without encompassing all of them. This is partly 
explained by the lack of experience in this area of certain 
European partners and by the speed with which the project had to 
be set up. Nevertheless, AFNOR (the French standards 
association), which has established a considerable lead in this 
area, and with the backing of the national interprofessional 
bio-industry organization (Organibio), asked the European 
Committee for Standardization [CEN] to form a technical 
committee, TC 233 biotechnology, which it would coordinate. 
Moreover, the CEN obtained an EC mandate (from Directorate 
General Three) to finance much of this work. 
  After the inevitable delay while an effective body was set 
up, the program is now developing in acceptable conditions. It 
is hoped that the great majority of national biotechnology 
experts will cooperate by making constructive comments on the 
documents being drawn up in the various international working 
groups set up to produce the first draft. 
  This has been a rapid and perhaps tedious overview of the 
current state of biotechnology regulations and standardization 
in France and in Europe. 
  In such a wide field of application -- ranging from 
agriculture to genetic therapy and from basic research to 
marketing -- it is a long and arduous process to take everyone's 
point of view into consideration. The important thing, however, 
must surely be that we are seeing, for the first time in 
scientific history, safety discussions taking priority over 
industrial application. 
  There is a potential risk associated with biotechnology, 
very 
well defined by Professor Royer in his 1981 report commissioned 
by the industry ministry. Only by the pragmatic study permitted 
by the intelligent application of regulations and standards can 
we further our knowledge of this potential risk and either 
confirm it or disprove it. Advances in developing this 
knowledge can only be made using a progressive approach, 
structured between safety barriers, permitting dialogue only 
between operators and members of independent socio-scientific 
commissions, and subject to secrecy in the discussions.

<F P=106> [Article signed Annette Millet: "ADEME: Between Politics </F>
and the Environment"] 
  [Text] The biotechnology research work backed by the ADEME 
[Environment And Energy Use Agency] attempts to find a 
compromise between protection of the environment and new 
openings for agricultural production. The creation of a 
scientific interest grouping [GIS] for the economic development 
of energy crops could provide the ADEME with fresh impetus. 
  The multidisciplined vocations of the ADEME include backing 
and coordinating research projects. Hit by the 1994 budget 
which shaved some 30 percent off its research and development 
funding, the young agency will no longer be able to meet the 
aims of its research program for the 1992-1996 period. It will, 
however, maintain its effort to finance scientific theses and, 
in the agroindustrial field, it hopes to receive fresh impetus 
from the creation of a GIS for the economic development of 
energy crops. 
  During the restructuring program carried out last year, the 
ADEME -- created in 1992 from the merger of the French Energy 
Use Agency [AFME], the National Agency for the Recovery and 
Elimination of Waste [ANRED], and the Air Quality Agency [AQA] 
-- began to work in four major sectors: industry, the habitat 
and renewable energy sources, transport, and agriculture and 
bioenergy. Its research budget for 1994 took heavy cuts in the 
number of programs it could authorize from two of its parent 
ministries, Industry and Research (the Research Ministry cut its 
program authorizations by 30 percent while payment 
appropriation, abnormally low since 1991, rose by 20 percent). 
Globally, agency funding remained more or less stable, thanks 
to an increase in funds from the tax levied on waste products. 
This money, however, must be spent on research into household 
and normal industrial waste, and atmospheric pollution from 
large installations, leaving by the wayside certain of the 
priorities set out in the research and development program for 
1992-1996: energy use, the restoration of contaminated sites, 
and research into untaxed air pollution. These are all areas 
that are liable to suffer from the reduction in ADEME funding. 
  Of the three bodies merged into the ADEME, only the AFME 
received research credits for the financing of its work, the 
creation of support networks, and enabling it to work with 
public and industrial research laboratories. In the 
biotechnology sector, the AFME was active in three main areas. 
Firstly, solar bioenergy, with the joint creation in 1982 with 
the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] of the Association for 
Research into Solar Biotechnology [ARBS]. Participants from 
industry included Rhone-Poulenc, Total, and Elf. This 
association worked for six years researching into a way of 
producing hydrogen or hydrocarbons from plants and 
photosynthesizing bacteria. The ARBS was then integrated into 
an AEC laboratory. The second line of research was the 
methanization of industrial effluent, slurry, and household 
waste. One of the agency's functions in this area was to 
support the research and development stages of the Valorga 
process. The third line of research was in replacement fuel 
sources from the biomass. The AFME's finest achievement in this 
domain (and the most expensive) was the financing of the 
Soustons platform (southwestern France), originally designed 
around the "green refinery" concept and which is currently 
operated by an industrial company (SAF-Isis). 
  Over the years, the changing socioeconomic context has 
altered the purpose of the work financed by the agency. Thus, 
research into methanization, which was commenced with the aim of 
achieving energy independence, now aims at environmental 
protection, for example with the treatment of food industry 
effluent. With the creation of the ADEME, biotechnology 
reasserted its role of serving the environment, already 
established with biomass and cellulolysis research. New avenues 
were explored, such as biomatter, food, and pharmaceutical 
constituents (flavorings, colorings, texturing agents, and 
enzymes), bioprocesses applied to effluent and solid waste 
treatment, etc. This clarification of issues is particularly 
well-defined in the ADEME policy on cofinancing thesis grants. 
  Currently financed research is split equally between 
environmental protection and energy use. Given the severe 
cutback in funding, the ADEME has fallen back on the hard core 
project of cofinancing, with industrial companies or local 
communities, thesis students working in priority areas. 
Awarding thesis grants allows a certain freedom of action since 
it is thus possible to examine more adventurous subjects or 
subjects whose results are less certain. 
  Between 1988 and 1993, the field of biological engineering, 
for example, was the subject of 21 theses. In 1993 these 
included work on the microbial production of surface active 
agents (cofinanced with the French Petroleum Institute [IFP]) 
and the enzymatic alteration of cellulosed materials 
(co-financed with a laboratory of the National Scientific 
Research Center [CNRS]). Biological engineering does not 
completely dominate biotechnology work, however. In 1993, the 
Impact and Environment Research Service [SRIM] financed theses 
on the development of a biosensor for the prevention of 
accidental pollution (air and waste) and on the bioevaluation of 
polluted soil, researching toxicity biomarkers in rats (sentinel 
animals). Biotechnology still accounts for just 15 percent of 
the 80 thesis grants cofinanced by the ADEME each year. 
  In the field of biotechnology, research could take off again 
thanks to the creation of the agency for the economic 
development of energy crops. Announced in December 1992 and 
confirmed by Hubert Curien at the Agricultural Show of March 
1993, this agency should become operational in the first quarter 
of 1994. The project will initially take the form of a GIS 
controlled by the ADEME and based on a contractual agreement 
between different partners: the ADEME, the national agronomy 
research institute [INRA], and the IFP, working closely with the 
ministries of agriculture, research, and industry. The Industry 
Ministry would also like to involve industrial groups. The 
fields of operation of this national research and development 
project are fully in line with the recommendations of the Levy 
report on biofuels -- to develop research to improve the 
competitiveness of biofuels. They are defined in terms of 
product lines. Under examination will be: lipidic plants (rape, 
proteaginous species) and their possibilities for producing oils 
and methylic esters; lignocellulose plants that are sources of 
biofuel; and carbohydrate plants (wheat, beetroot, corn, and 
sorghum), producing ethanol and ethyl tertiobutyl ether (ETBE). 
A fourth program will aim at finding new uses for agriculture 
producing neither food or energy, but biopolymers, biodegradable 
surface active agents, vegetable lipochemistry, etc.). A fifth, 
cross-disciplinary program will be dedicated to the economic 
aspects and environmental impact of new products being studied. 
The idea is to be able to one day make concrete proposals to 
farmers offering them a choice of production systems. The 
public expenditure set aside for the GIS should amount to some 
40 million French francs in its first year. 
  Current ADEME research projects therefore operate according 
to a double logic: stimulating protection of the environment and 
finding an answer to the problems posed by agricultural policy.

<F P=106> [Article signed F.F.: "Which Military Technologies Will </F>
France Have to Give Up?"] 
  [Text] The General Commission of the National Plan has just 
published a report on the "future of defense-related industries" 
anticipating major job cuts in the sector. As a result, 
following the trend in the national and export markets, the 
French defense industry, which accounted for 330,000 direct and 
indirect jobs at the start of 1993, is expected to lose between 
58,000 and 130,000 direct and indirect jobs by 1997. 
  Faced with these new requirements, the report states that 
France will not be able to remain self-sufficient in equipment 
development and will have to enter into cooperation agreements 
with its European partners. In this respect, the report 
identifies 24 critical technologies which it divides into three 
categories: those that need to be totally independent at French 
or European level and whose proliferation would constitute a 
risk; those that have intermediate priority; and those 
technologies whose specifically dual-purpose nature (civil and 
military) makes them less sensitive. 
<H5>  Creating a Budget for the Acquisition of Foreign Technologies </H5>
  Apart from nuclear technology, the first category includes 
"micro- and nanoelectronic components for equipment and 
subassemblies, navigation equipment, detection and signal 
processing equipment, signature-recognition expertise, and 
stealth-related technology, including knowhow in complex 
systems." The intermediate priority technologies group includes 
"modular electronic architecture, optical and optronic devices, 
telecommunications hardware and networks, advanced computer 
hardware, artificial intelligence and neural networks, software 
engineering, and advanced calculating codes." 
  Finally, the less sensitive, dual-purpose technologies 
include production software and industrial production systems, 
and the technologies and hardware implemented in the security of 
equipment and weapons systems. The report specifically 
recommends that the amount of credits for basic defense research 
should be maintained at present levels or even increased, and 
suggests the additional creation of a budget earmarked for the 
evaluation and acquisition of foreign technologies.

<F P=106> [Article by Pietro Gianvanni: "Polyphem, The Arrival of </F>
Optical Fibers"] 
  [Text] The German Army, like most of the other European 
armies, is feeling the lack of air transport vehicles for the 
movement and deployment of mobile contingents. This shortage 
has become more pronounced with the organization of the NATO 
Rapid Reaction Force. The Bundeswehr has tried to get round 
this problem using sections equipped with light armaments for 
which the biggest problem remains that of firing support, both 
of the traditional type supplied by field equipment (artillery 
and tanks), and that given by fighter helicopters. However, 
this is inevitable, since the firing power is not sufficient to 
meet the requirements of lightness and mobility. Because of 
this situation, interest has arisen in a weapon that is light 
enough, accurate, and powerful, that would be able to make valid 
tactical support available to detachments. 
  The French find themselves in a better situation as far as 
mobility is concerned. However, they also need an antitank 
system capable of effecting medium distance strikes beyond the 
horizon. In 1984 the German MBB [Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm] 
and L'Aerospatiale started to study the concept of a missile 
able to cover distances exceeding 10 kilometers, connected to a 
fixed position by means of an optical fiber cable that transmits 
images to the operator, showing the ground over which the 
missile flies, and enabling the operator to search for the 
target, identify it, and strike it. The results of the research 
were verified in 1988, on the Magny range, by four launches made 
to demonstrate the technology of the system. Four SS12M 
anti-tank missiles were converted for the occasion. They were 
renamed "Polyphem-demo," the program taking its name from one of 
the Cyclops of Greek mythology. They weighed 76 kilograms and 
the warheads had been substituted by miniature television 
cameras mounted on triaxial stabilized platforms, the wiring of 
their remote control systems being substituted by optical 
fibers. The television cameras and the optical fiber 
connections had been derived from commercial products, the first 
from Sony and the second from Fukuda. The autonomy of the 
missiles was limited to six kilometers by the length of the 
cable and the size of the range. 
  The success of the Polyphem-demo enabled the two companies 
to 
obtain an order to continue with the work, valued at 216 million 
French francs [Fr] (about 48 billion Italian lire), from the 
French and German governments in 1991. This sum represents 60 
percent of the Fr360 million necessary to complete the 
demonstration phase. The remaining 40 percent will come from 
industry. 
  Deutsche Aerospace (which in the meantime has absorbed MBB) 
and Aerospatiale are engaged in a 51-month program to test the 
validity of a guidance system that uses optical fibers. The 
work will end with the test launching of a missile 2.40 meters 
long, with a wing span of 1.10 meters, weighing 100 kilograms, 
and having an autonomy of 15 kilometers, with its flight slated 
for 1995, and with the testing of its relative fixed guidance 
position. 
  DASA [German Aerospace Corporation] is following the 
development of the missile, while Aerospatiale has been 
entrusted with the ground station. The main subcontractors are 
BMW/Rolls Royce for the jet engine, SEL [Lorenz Standard 
Electric company] for the optical fibers, and Rheinmetall for 
the initial acceleration booster and the actuators for the fins. 
  Italy also joined the program in 1992 but is excluded from 
this phase which is now too far advanced. It could participate 
in the perfection and personalization of the ground station and 
the launching modules. 
  Funding of 6.6 billion lire has been made available for the 
project under the Italian defense budget for 1994. DASA and 
Aerospatiale are in close contact with the Italmissile 
consortium, that comprises Alenia, OTO Melara and Snia BPD 
[Bombrini, Parodi and Delfino], for the Polyphem missile. 
<H5>  Polyphem Takes Form </H5>
  The antitank version of the Polyphem missile will be two 
meters long and the anti-helicopter version will be 1.6 meters 
long. The launching weight, depending on the use of the 
missile, will be either 53 or 43 kilograms. The diameter of the 
body will be 16.5 centimeters. The body is divided into three 
main parts, the nose contains the infrared sensor mounted on a 
stabilized platform, the transmission electronics, and the 
warhead; the central part contains the jet engine, the booster, 
the fuel tank and the fins that can be unfolded. Finally, the 
rear end contains the cable bobbin, the folding directional 
fins, and the battery. 
  The telecamera on the Polyphem prototype will be replaced 
with an infrared sensor that will enable the missile to be used 
both during the day and at night. The selected wavelength is 
between three and five millimeters. The sensitive material is 
made of platinum silicon cells, their sensitivity can be varied 
by the computer at the ground station and the results are 
reproduced on a television screen. The latter and the image 
recorder are made of normal materials that are commercially 
available, which confirms the fact that the quality of civilian 
products is reaching levels that were unimaginable until a few 
years ago. 
  The entire configuration is so elastic that high definition 
television systems, able to utilize the current 625 scanning 
lines, will be able to be used in the future. The search for 
and identification of targets requires the image to be as still 
as possible, and therefore the sensor has been fixed on a 
platform that is stabilized on three axes. The clarity of the 
images and the availability of long focuses have also been at 
the basis of the decision not to weigh down the missile with 
other navigational sensors with the exception of an altimeter 
that checks that height is maintained. 
  The designers have looked at the problem of navigation over 
the sea and in areas of poor contrast (such as the desert) and 
for this type of use GPS [global positioning system] Navstar 
equipment could be mounted in the anterior part of the missile 
supplying information on the position and height every half 
second. The precision necessary (remembering that the 
degradation of the signal of the GPS satellites available to the 
defense department does not permit better precision than 100 
meters, compared to the 10 meters available to the U.S. Army) 
would be obtained by using an additional GPS on the ground, by 
means of the so-called differential GPS procedure, in which the 
data from a fixed GPS enables the data from the mobile system 
mounted on the missile to be rapidly corrected. 
  The Polyphem is assisted by a Rheinmetall booster during the 
launching stage. This takes it up to an initial height of 200 
meters and a speed of 150 meters per second. The cruising 
engine is a derivative of the WJ119-2 made by Williams, the 
American company, and built under license by BMW-Rolls Royce. 
The air inlets and the exhausts are fitted onto the sides of 
the body so that they do not disturb the unrolling of the cable. 
The jet module is an integral part of the body and the presence 
of an engine of this type permits a certain elasticity in the 
choice of speed for the missile, which can vary between 120 and 
180 meters per second, with a flexibility that cannot be 
obtained from propulsion systems that are exclusively propelled 
by rockets. The Polyphem has four folding wings that are fixed 
onto the central section and four moveable directional fins, 
that also fold and that are fitted onto the final section. 
  However, the real news regarding the Polyphem, lies in the 
command transmission system and the images received via a 0.25 
millimeter optical fiber cable. The technicians have given 
assurance that once the system has been perfected it will be 
possible to follow the missile for a distance of up to 60 k both 
directions with the command data travelling toward the missile 
and the video data arriving at the guidance station from the 
missile. The "extension" of the missile's electronics on the 
ground has made it possible for the equipment on board to be 
simplified and for the missile to be so light and small. 
Another advantage of this choice is that all the updates and 
improvements of the hardware and of the software (processing the 
optical signals, regulating the levels of sensitivity of the 
sensors, and the tracking and navigation procedures) can be made 
through interventions at the ground station alone. 
  The real technological challenge is, on the other hand, the 
perfection of the winding system for the optical fiber, that 
must allow it to work in harmony with the varying speeds of the 
missile. The cable is extremely resistant to abrasion too, but 
the tensions to which it is subjected are already high, without 
considering any eventual "jerks" due to the unwinding and 
rewinding phenomena that are typical of bobbins turning at 
speeds that are not constant. The cable is wound in successive 
layers that stick together lightly so as to avoid widening of 
the turns, but enough to allow it to work without presenting too 
much resistance. DASA and Filotex SEL/Alcatel are continuing 
their studies with the intention of achieving a bobbin able to 
contain up to 100 kilometers of cable. 
  The operator is provided with a stick at the ground station 
with which he controls the movements of the fins and the engine 
of the missile according to the images that he sees on the 
screen. The guidance options that are available provide for the 
Polyphem to fly in a straight line at cruising speed (in this 
mode the movement of the missile is not tied to that of the 
telecamera, that can be turned at will to explore the scene); or 
it can proportionally follow the movements ordered to the 
television camera in a horizontal plane (maintaining its 
height), or link the movements of the missile to those of the 
television camera both in azimuth and in elevation; this latter 
system is normally used whilst closing in on the target. In the 
final stage of attack a tracking system comes into play that 
keeps the target at the center of the television screen, in this 
case the operator only makes the corrections that he considers 
necessary to hit the target at its most vulnerable point. 
  The warhead varies according to the type of objective. For 
antitank missions it is of the tandem type, having a total 
weight of nine kilograms of explosive, whilst for use against 
helicopters it is a single three kilogram warhead. The Polyphem 
is transported in, and launched from, containers having variable 
configurations from six to 40 cells. The containers can be 
fitted onto trucks or onto caterpillar chassis, or be fixed 
batteries on ships or part of coastal defenses. Amongst the 
hypotheses concerning the use of the missile there is also that 
of launching it from submarines. The concept of this hypothesis 
is being studied by the Bundesmarine [Federal Navy] 
independently of the Polyphem agreement. 
  The Polyphem program represents the first use of optical 
fiber technology for military operations. It is a technology 
that promises many advantages but that also presents margins of 
doubt. Amongst the first let us remember the possibility of 
seeing the battlefield from beyond the horizon and following the 
weapon as far as the target without having to load it with 
expensive and complex systems as well as being able to "speak 
to" the missile in a secure way, even in an environment 
saturated with countermeasures. On the other hand the velocity 
of the missile plays against it, as it is not high and over long 
distances it could allow the enemy to organize effective 
defense, also because, increasing the distance, the missile must 
increase its quota to allow the optical fiber cable to function 
correctly.

<F P=106> [Article entitled: "Fallout of the Rafale Program Delay"; </F>
first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL 
introduction] 
  [Text] A parliamentary report estimates that the six-month 
delay in the Rafale program will cost an additional 700 million 
French francs [Fr] and over 1,000 jobs at Dassault, SNECMA, and 
Thomson-CSF. 
  Delaying a weapons program is always a costly move. The 
report compiled by Bouches-du-Rhone deputy Olivier Darrason and 
presented on behalf of the National Defense Committee in the 
Assembly offers fresh evidence of the fact. The Bouches-du-Rhone 
deputy, who is the reporter for the "Air" portion of the budget, 
calculated the cost of the government's decision to slow down 
the Rafale program at an additional Fr700 million. Most 
important, 1,170 to 1,420 highly-skilled jobs will be lost. 
  The official reason for the six-month delay are budget 
decisions that will hold up the aircraft carrier, thus setting 
back the start-of-service date of the "Navy" and consequently 
the "Air" Rafale. The reporter, who considers Rafale primarily a 
replacement for Crusaders on the Foch, and not the 
Charles-de-Gaulle, challenges that pretext. The deputy believes 
the real reason is budget problems. 
  Whatever the true cause, Olivier Darrason believes the 
financial and industrial costs will be high. He estimates the 
delay will raise the price tag of the program by Fr700 
million--Fr400 million for development and Fr300 million for 
manufacture. "Thus, although we will save Fr1,535 million on the 
1994 budget, final savings will reportedly be only Fr800 
million, or about half," he calculates. 
  But it is primarily the industrial consequences that are 
likely to cut deepest. Indeed, contrary to conventional wisdom, 
the projected budget delay cannot be absorbed solely by freezing 
new hiring, since program teams have already been sized to meet 
the deadlines in effect before the announced holdup. As a 
consequence, the deputy thinks job losses are unavoidable. To 
estimate them, he used a pre-study conducted last July by the 
ACE-International consortium on the consequences of potential 
lags. Although manufacturers are not committed to these numbers, 
which should be treated with caution, they do bring the picture 
into focus. 
  "For Dassault Aviation and its subcontractors," says the 
report, "a six-month delay could cost 400 jobs, most of them 
engineer and high-level technician positions." Likewise, another 
770 to 1,020 workers would be at risk among all the program's 
equipment suppliers: 200 at the enginemaker SNECMA, 450 to 700 
for the electronics manufacturers (essentially Thomson-CSF and 
Dassault Electronique), and 120 for "C" equipment suppliers such 
as Dassault Equipements, ECE, Intertechnique, Labinal, 
Messier-Bugatti, Sagem, and Sextant. In all, over a thousand 
jobs, most of them in engineering, are at stake. "This is an 
unacceptable risk, for it would not only translate into 
additional delays and thus greater risks to employment, it would 
also mean an irretrievable loss of technological raw material," 
comments Olivier Darrason. 
  Finally, the setbacks in the Rafale program clearly could 
compromise the fighter plane's chances for sales abroad. Between 
1996 and 2000 or 2003, Dassault's aircraft will have no serious 
rival on the market. The F/A-18E/F, Gripen, and Eurofighter 2000 
will still be pending. However, competition after that date will 
be fierce. Considering the combat fleet modernization needs that 
will then exist, France must make maximum use of the period to 
capture those markets. "We should be aware, then," concludes the 
report, "that delaying the Rafale means denying it export 
markets--a major asset against its rivals."

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Matra Proposes a Combination </F>
Milas/Otomat Mk3 System"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] The French firm is bringing out a combination 
weapons system featuring the new Milas torpedo-bearing and the 
Otomat Mk3 antiship missiles. Italy, Saudi Arabia, and the 
Emirates are its first targeted customers. 
  Matra Defense unveiled its new, combination navy weapons 
system featuring two new types of long-range missiles in a 
single firing unit at the Dubai Show held last week in the Gulf 
Emirates. The antisubmarine torpedo-bearing Milas carries a 
light torpedo about 55 km, while the antiship Otomat Mk3 can 
attack the biggest surface vessels from as far away as 180 km. 
  According to Matra Defense, the combination Milas/Otomat Mk3 
offers "unrivaled flexibility at minimal cost and with minimal 
space, weight, and electrical requirements." Indeed, a single 
combat system fires both the Milas or Otomat Mk3 using various 
on-board sensors (sonars, radars, sight units, etc.) and one 
control panel manned by a single operator. The missiles use the 
same firing containers mounted in pairs, a fact that enables the 
same firing unit to control 12 tubes containing any combination 
of Milas or Otomat Mk3 missiles. According to Matra, the 
eight-tube combination system can be installed on any warship 
starting at about 1,000 metric tons. 
<H5>  Firing at a Ship From 180 Meters </H5>
  The Milas, says Matra, is "a new torpedo-bearing missile 
designed to respond without delay to the briefest detection of a 
faraway submarine", by firing a light torpedo at the target from 
distances of between 5 and 55 km. The National Navy has opted 
for the new Franco-Italian torpedo Impact, alias MU-90, which 
was designed on the basis of components of the Whitehead A290 
and DCN's Murene torpedoes. The French and Italian navies are 
expected to order Impact--supposedly in early 1995--from 
Eurotorp, a consortium of Whitehead (50 percent), DCN 
International (26 percent), and Thomson-Sintra ASM (24 percent). 
For export purposes, Matra is also studying ways to adapt the 
American light torpedo Mk46 (Honeywell) to Milas. 
  The Otomat Mk3 antiship missiles borrow the technical 
refinements of Milas, and the airframe and propulsion system 
(Microturbo turbojet) of the Otomat Mk2. The 650-kg missile--205 
kg of which is explosive charge--flies at Mach 0.9 and ranges 
180 km. According to Matra, the Mk3 has a lower signature and is 
less vulnerable than a powder missile. It also boasts 
performance that is superior to that of earlier versions, partly 
due to a new Thomson-CSF homing head. The Otomat Mk3 can attack 
a target via four preselected trajectories. It travels through 
three orientation points while skirting obstacles (islands, 
etc.), and automatically resets to the target in-flight before 
finally intercepting it via hedge-hopping or diving (nose-up 
dive) flight. Operators can fire a salvo of three Otomat Mk3s at 
a single target at intervals of three seconds, or a single 
missile every 20 seconds. 
  The Otomat Mk3 borrows certain technical refinements from 
the 
Milas, whose development--kicked off in 1988 under contract to 
the French and Italian navies--should be complete in late 1995. 
Production of the Milas will begin in 1996. In contrast, the 
Otomat Mk3 is a joint research project of Matra Defense and OTO 
Melara (Italy), funded through their own equity. This is the 
same formula that was used for earlier Otomat versions, nearly a 
thousand of which (980) sold to ten countries. But the French 
missilemaker points out that full development of the new Otomat 
will proceed only if an order (still to be won) is placed. 
Assuming one is, the missile(s) could be delivered about a year 
and a half after the contract. A spokesperson for the firm says 
the Otomat Mk3 should be available around 1995. 
  Matra lists Italy, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi 
Arabia--for its F2000S destroyers--as the first potential 
customers for Milas, the new Otomat, and the combination 
Milas/Otomat Mk3.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "France's Strategic Propulsion </F>
Capability In Jeopardy"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] After 10 years of shelved programs and no new 
developments, followed by the threat of a postponed M5, the 
European Propellent Company (SEP) and SNPE [National Powder and 
Explosives Company] are mobilizing to save France's "national 
capability" in strategic ballistic propulsion. 
  Nothing less than a warning cry was sounded last week by 
officials of the Large Solid Rocket Booster Group, alias G2P. 
The little-known consortium of SEP (75 percent) and SNPE (25 
percent) designs and produces solid rocket engines for tactical 
(Pluton and Hades) and strategic (SSBS and MSBS) nuclear 
ballistic missiles. The Group's appeal coincided with the new 
nominations of Pierre Betin, SEP deputy general manager, as 
administrator and general manager of G2P, and of Emile Blanc, 
SNPE CEO, as its Supervisory Board president (see AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1446). 
  In its first public statement since its inception in 1972, 
G2P is desperately sounding the alarm to "save the national 
capability" in large ballistic-missile propulsion systems. That 
capability, stresses Emile Blanc, "represents an approximately 
Fr25 billion investment over the last 25 years"! 
  Indeed, the leaders of the group and its parent companies 
worry about a far-from-hypothetical risk that France could lose 
its technical and industrial expertise in the manufacture of 
big, military solid rocket boosters. For the last 10 years, the 
country has mainly conducted a dwindling number of "exploratory 
developments" (somewhere between research and actual 
developments), and has failed to produce new missiles (or 
propulsion systems). The S45 was shelved, and the new Navy M45 
strategic missile copies the propulsion system of the M4 that 
came out in 1980. Worse, the French Defense Ministry now appears 
ready to delay the introduction of the future M5 strategic Navy 
missile for two years. 
  "The current situation is certainly not upbeat, since there 
have been no developments in propulsion since the M4," stresses 
Jean Sollier, SEP's CEO. "The S45 was a great source of hope, 
quickly dashed" since the program launched in 1987 was halted in 
mid-1991. 
  True, the S45 was followed by several exploratory 
development contracts foreshadowing the M5. But, says Sollier, 
the contracts came along after 10 years of no activity and staff 
reductions. And according to SEP's CEO, there is now "a national 
problem" that "may cost the country the credibility of its 
dissuasive force by 2005 or 2010"! 
  SNPE and SEP have already seen their total strategic 
ballistic powder booster staff fall to less than a thousand, or 
40 percent of the number employed in the eighties. Most 
important, stresses Pierre Betin, the "hard core" of 
"technologists" (engineers, technicians, and workers) with real 
know-how in all aspects of big military rockets, from design 
through production, has been reduced to "the bare minimum." A 
detailed study of each position by G2P showed that this 
irreplacable capability had been whittled away to a mere 500-550 
by late 1993. 
  As far as Pierre Betin is concerned, "There would seem to 
be, 
if not peril, at least some danger"! 
  For as Emile Blanc stresses, the last few years have seen 
the 
scrapping of the Hades and the S45, the completion of the S3 and 
M4 (with the only production extension being the M45), and the 
delayed and still-threatened startup of the M5. 
  The G2P "can still survive", says P. Betin, "but not too 
long 
without government help"! 
  For government help is indeed the issue in a 
strategic-missile solid booster industry which, unlike space 
propulsion and its commercial offshoots, depends--as do the 
missiles--on government's willingness to fully back dissuasive 
policy. And France's strategic missile propulsion industry has 
not fallen down on the job, quite the contrary. As expert Pierre 
Betin, who has spent 30 years in the field, points out "There 
have been no failures in ballistic rocket flight since 1977"! 
  "But today we are weakened", he says, and "the lack of 
developments for the next 10 years poses a real danger of 
destroying our store of expertise." Moreover, space propulsion 
cannot replace strategic propulsion work among manufacturers. 
Although there can (and should be) certain synergies between the 
two, space and strategic propulsion are two different fields. 
Performance and technical demands (structural ratio, total life, 
environmental resistance, etc.) are greater for solid military 
boosters. This is illustrated by Nitralane, developed and 
perfected in France for the M5, and ultimately never used 
despite the fact that it reportedly boosts French missiles to 
the same level as the best American ones (Trident D2). Despite 
budget restrictions, the United States takes great care to 
preserve its expertise! 
  In France, in contrast, the situation is already red alert. 
According to P. Betin, France's strategic propulsion industry 
and know-how would be jeopardized if the M5 program were 
temporarily halted as announced. And Emile Blanc fears that "We 
will start next year at this year's level, then reduce funding 
another 10 percent." 
  According to Blanc, neither research nor production can take 
care of the situation alone. France urgently needs to apply its 
store of know-how by making and regularly firing missiles (the 
current timetable is one every two years). "If we get stuck in 
exploratory developments only, our expertise will evaporate and 
our personnel lose motivation," says Pierre Betin. The 
government must therefore pursue development of the M5's 
propulsion system. 
  But Emile Blanc insists that "The M5 will not be enough, for 
there are no plans to follow it up with anything." This is 
because France no longer has a regular, continuing series of 
ballistic missile programs (under development or production), as 
before. Consequently, the industry also needs to continue 
exploratory development and refinement of big powder boosters 
"to preserve the field." 
  Concretely, says the knowledgable Emile Blanc (a former 
General Weapons Delegate), France must spend a minimum of Fr1 
billion a year to keep its strategic propulsion capability 
afloat. Half, or Fr500 million, must go to keep the "hard core" 
of about 500 specialists intact. That amounts to only two 
percent of the funding for the national dissuasive force, which 
gobbles up approximately Fr25 billion a year!

<F P=106> [Article by Bernard Bombeau: "Thomson-CSF Modernizing </F>
MiG-21/23's and Su-22"; introductory paragraph in boldface as 
published] 
  [Text] Thomson-CSF and its subsidiary Sextant 
Avionics are coveting a deal for the modernization of between 
550 and 600 MiG-21's, a few hundred MiG-23's, and 500 Su-22's. 
The deal is worth a total of from 25 billion to 30 billion 
francs. 
  The French equipment manufacturer unveiled technical details 
at the Dubai Air Show regarding two agreements signed with 
Mikoyan and Sukhoi (see our issue No. 1439) to retrofit 
MiG-21's, MiG-23's, and Su-22's in partnership with the 
Phazotron firm, which produced the Doppler radar used on the 
MiG-29. 
  Those modernization programs are aimed primarily at Asian 
and 
East European countries wanting to upgrade their combat fleets 
consisting basically of older generations of Russian aircraft. 
  In charge of the project at Thomson-CSF is Gerard Le Breton, 
director of operational projects. He estimates that the 
potential market (excluding the PRC and the CIS [Commonwealth of 
Independent States]) totals from 550 to 600 MiG-21's, from 400 
to 500 Su-22's, and a few hundred MiG-23's. That comes to over 
1,000 aircraft in all, not counting the related opportunities 
that will arise if the same program is extended to 
first-generation Mirage F1's and Mirage III's (from 200 to 300 
aircraft)--all told, a gold mine worth from $4 billion to $5 
billion. 
  One coveted customer, India, has already expressed a need to 
modernize between 100 and 150 of the 450 to 500 MiG-21's it 
still has in flying condition. But while described as a 
priority, that program has not yet been the object of any 
official call for bids. Indian intentions regarding an 
industrial effort expected around 1995 should become clearer in 
coming weeks or months. 
  Thomson-CSF is not the only beneficiary of special 
agreements 
with Mikoyan. Dassault Electronics, in partnership with the 
Russian research institute GosNIIA, signed a three-party 
agreement last June covering a more limited modernization 
program (see the end of this article). There is also especially 
stiff competition with the Israeli firms IAI and Elbit. They 
have joined with Romania's Aerostar to propose in particular an 
independent modernization program for from 100 to 120 MiG-21's 
belonging to the Romanian Air Force. The Israelis have a letter 
of intent for four prototypes. Russian participation is not out 
of the question. 
  The competition also includes Great Britain's GEC-Marconi, 
which is offering retrofits centered on the Blue Hawk radar, and 
Italy's FIAR with a variant of its Grifo. 
  In the face of their competition, Thomson-CSF and Sextant 
Avionics are banking on an extensive and particularly ambitious 
modernization program. Le Breton says: "We are the only ones 
proposing a multirole weapon system based on a complete 
architecture meeting the needs of each customer and capable of 
being adapted equally well to MiG-21's, MiG-23's, Su-22's, 
Mirage III's, and Mirage F1's. Each deal is subject to a prior 
authorization request depending on the customer. The only 
restrictions imposed absolutely are political in nature and 
concern such `sensitive' countries as Libya, Iraq, or Syria." 
  The proposal by Thomson-CSF/Sextant includes no fewer than 
20 
different items of equipment meeting the Mil-Std-1553B bus 
standard, many of which are already certified (or in service) on 
French and foreign aircraft. Other items of equipment, including 
radar, are in development. 
  At the heart of the architecture in question is a wide-angle 
(26 degrees) so-called smart head-up display [HUD], all of whose 
functions (symbol generation, display, and keyboard interface 
with the inertial system) are integrated within a single unit. 
That HUD is being offered with an OTAL200-1300 camera for image 
interpretation. 
  The head-down display, consisting of multifunction 
liquid-crystal displays, is capable of displaying images from 
the Rubis navigation and targeting system. 
  Also as part of its package, Thomson-CSF is offering the 
Totem gyrolaser inertial guidance system--which its subsidiary 
Sextant is also producing for a retrofit of the Air Force's 
Transall aircraft--combined with a NSS100 Code P GPS [global 
positioning system] receiver that comes as a separate unit and 
is capable of horizontal accuracy of 18 m. Another piece of 
equipment being offered and meeting NATO standards is an SC10 
Mk-XII IFF [identification friend or foe] unit in protected mode 
(Secure). The field of electronic warfare is covered by the 
installation of a Sherloc radar warning detector, a Barem 
jamming transmitter, and an ER/IR chaff dispenser. 
  In cooperation with Phazotron, Thomson-CSF is currently 
developing the Phathom multifunction and multitarget Doppler 
radar based on Russian Kopyo (MiG-29) and French RDY technology. 
In that development work, Thomson-CSF is directly involved in 
the refinement of digital and signal processing systems, while 
Phazotron is working on the transmitter, receiver, antenna, and 
power supply. The two equipment manufacturers are working 
together to refine an analog processor. 
  Characterized by a compact, small-diameter antenna weighing 
no more than 120 kg, the Phathom is a radar in the generic 40 Nm 
class with a detection range of from 50 to 60 km in the case of 
aerial targets, 100 km in the case of ground targets, and 30 km 
in the case of targets at sea. 
  In air-to-air mode, it is reportedly capable of detecting 24 
targets and tracking six using discontinuous data and four in 
intensified pursuit with the possibility of engaging two at a 
time using target-seeking missiles with active warheads. 
  According to Mikoyan, the weapon system on the modernized 
MiG-21 (MiG-21-93) will be able to reach targets flying at an 
altitude of between 30 and 20,000 meters. 
  In air-to-surface mode, the Phathom, combined with a 
head-down display, can be connected with the Rubis FLIR 
navigation and targeting pod, the TMV630 laser rangefinder, and 
the CLDP laser designator (day/night) pod with modular 
capability (TV/IR). In the two last-named configurations, it can 
also be combined with the HMD (helmet-mounted display) (20 
degrees) that is being offered as an option. 
  Thomson-CSF feels that the Phathom is currently the best 
radar available in the retrofit market. "Its performance puts it 
in the same class as the RDY, although it has less detection 
capability because of the small diameter of its antenna." 
  Although the current tendency is to use existing armament 
(air-to-air and air-to-surface) of Russian origin, the weapon 
systems on the modernized MiG's and Su-22's will make it 
possible to use missiles or laser-guided bombs made in the West. 
Thomson-CSF is adding to that the possibility of using a 
subsidiary infrastructure: mission simulator, NCS (Matra) flight 
preparation systems, and peripheral equipment. 
  In Gerard Le Breton's opinion, mounting the Phathom on 
Russian fighter planes of an older generation is only the first 
stage of a long-range development that it will be possible to 
apply to more modern aircraft such as the MiG-29, the Su-27, and 
even the Mirage-2000 10 years from now. 
  But despite that, Thomson-CSF rejects any idea of competing 
with anything currently in production: "Our proposal is directed 
at air forces whose temporarily limited budgets do not permit 
them to consider the acquisition of modern fighter planes, which 
cost in the neighborhood of from $20 million to $35 million per 
unit." 
  Depending on the options requested by each particular 
customer, retrofitting a MiG-21 or Su-22 may cost from $3.5 
million to $8.6 million (from 20 million to 50 million francs). 
The price of the radar alone borders on $1 million, to which can 
be added $3.5 million for an air-to-surface mission profile 
based on a CLDP with TV/IR head. "We are more than open to 
various forms of financing and industrial cooperation that may 
include subcontracting or technology transfers," says Le Breton, 
expanding his remarks to encompass the future: "By offering 
modern equipment on old aircraft, Thomson-CSF is also making a 
number of potential customers aware of our firm's capabilities 
and of the most recent products that French aircraft 
manufacturers have available in the market for new products." 
  The architecture being proposed by Thomson-CSF/Sextant for 
the Sukhoi Su-22 consists of the following: 
  1. Radar warning detector (Sherloc). 
  2. GPS/Glonass (NSS 100P) receiver. 
  3. Radio altimeter (AHV-6). 
  4. Gyrolaser inertial guidance system (Totem). 
  5. Helmet-mounted display (HMD). 
  6. Smart head-up display (SHUD). 
  7. Multifunction liquid crystal displays (MFD-55). 
  8. Radio navigation: VHF/UHF (ERA 2000); VOR/ILS (NR-810A); 
TACAN (NC12); and IFF MK XII (SC-10). 
  9. In-flight refueling system and probe. 
  10. On-board instruments. 
  11. Multifunction Doppler radar (Phathom). 
  12. Laser rangefinder (TMV630). 
  13. Digital mapping. 
  14. Mission preparation system (CINNA 3PN). 
  15. Mission computer with recorder and mission playback. 
  16. FLIR navigation and targeting pod (Rubis). 
  17. TV/IR laser designation pod (CLDP). 
  18. Armament (missiles). 
  19. ECM pod (Barem). 
  20. Electric generator (Auxilec). 
  21. Equipment cooling system. 
  22. Chaff dispenser (cartridges). 
<H5>  Dassault Electronics: Different Philosophy </H5>
  In its program for modernizing the MiG-21-93 in cooperation 
with Mikoyan and the Russian research institute GosNIIAS, 
Dassault Electronics has taken a different approach than 
Thomson-CSF. Considering "the urgency of the demand," Dassault 
Electronics is focusing on "fast response" with a program that 
is less ambitious in terms of both cost and deadlines. "Rather 
than proposing a retrofit that might take 30 months, we prefer 
to offer a more focused modernization available in less than two 
years." The program announced in June 1993 has two parts: a 
modular bus/computer (bus 1553) unit that can handle Russian or 
Western digital weapon systems and a sophisticated electronic 
warfare unit developed in close cooperation with Mikoyan and 
based on a new EWS-21 radar warning detector that was inspired 
by a system recently adopted (over its competitor Sherloc) by 
the French Air Force for modernizing its Mirage F1's. The entire 
package has an estimated cost of 15 million francs.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Norway Orders 7,200 Eryx </F>
Antitank Missiles From Aerospatiale"; introductory paragraph in 
boldface as published] 
  [Text] The first three customers for this antitank 
missile will keep the Aerospatiale plant in Bourges busy 
producing 500 missiles per month. 
  Aerospatiale has just landed a third customer for its Eryx 
missile, thus bringing the value of all its firm orders to 1.2 
billion francs. Norway, following Canada--which by coincidence 
is another "cold country"--has just purchased Eryx, "the only 
short-range antitank missile for use by infantry units." 
Lightweight and compact, the French missile is also the first 
missile capable not only of being launched in close quarters but 
also of damaging a heavy tank at close range (600 m). 
  According to the firm, the three Eryx orders received this 
year [1993] cover a total of 14,400 missiles and 1,049 
launchers. France has ordered 2,700 missiles and 200 launchers 
to be supplied from the first two phases of production. Canada 
signed up for 4,500 missiles and 425 launchers this past summer 
at a total price, according to Aerospatiale, "on the order of 
400 million francs." Norway has just ordered 7,200 missiles and 
424 launchers for an announced figure of about 650 million 
francs (with an option worth 300 million francs to be picked up 
before the end of 1996).

  That is the largest Eryx order received to date by the 
French 
firm, and it is the second to be received from a NATO country. 
According to Aerospatiale, it is also "the largest defense 
contract ever signed between France and Norway." Oslo is thus 
becoming a good customer for French weapons and for French 
missiles in particular, considering that Norway also ordered a 
sizable batch of Mistral very-short-range surface-to-air 
missiles from Matra Defense back in 1990. 
  The Eryx order was signed at Aerospatiale's head office in 
Paris on 23 November by Odd I. Nielsen, director of the 
Logistics Command of the Norwegian Army, and Jean-Louis Fache, 
director of Aerospatiale-Missiles, in the presence of Norwegian 
Minister of Defense Jorgen Kosmo and Norwegian Ambassador Arne 
Langeland. 
  On that occasion, the Norwegian minister emphasized that 
Eryx 
is "another example of successful cooperation" between the two 
countries in the field of armament. Louis Gallois, president and 
CEO of Aerospatiale, described the contract as representing a 
"real partnership combined with technology transfers." The 
offset agreement was signed at the same time by J.-L. Fache and 
Oivind Baekken, general director of armament. Aerospatiale 
points out that those "high-technology" offsets involve 
cooperation in research and development (risk analysis software 
and image processing software engineering) and the co-production 
of Eryx subsystems in Norway (the explosive charge by Raufoss in 
cooperation with Dyno and the missile wing unit by the NFT). 
Those components are being subcontracted for the entire Eryx 
program, not just for the missiles intended for Norway, as was 
the case previously with the Eryx tripods and sight units for 
Canada. But Aerospatiale will maintain a unit for production of 
the missile's wings, and Giat Industries will do the same with 
respect to the explosive charge (of SERAT design). 
  The French Army has already taken possession of its first 
mass-produced Eryx missiles, several dozen of which have been 
fired this year [1993] in winter conditions, both in Canada and 
in Norway. The Eryx has therefore qualified as a "cold-weather" 
weapon but also as a "hot-weather" weapon thanks to firings in 
Djibouti, says Aerospatiale. In all, according to the firm, the 
number of missiles fired for evaluation and testing comes to 
nearly 300. 
  Canada will take delivery of its first Eryx missiles at the 
end of November [1993], and Norway will receive its missiles 
early in 1995. 
  According to Aerospatiale, these three orders will keep the 
Bourges plant busy producing about 500 missiles per month. The 
current monthly production rate is only 150. But the firm says 
that the monthly rate is going to increase: to 300 in the first 
half of 1994 and 800 the year after that, after which it will 
top out at 1,000 missiles per month by the end of 1995 or the 
start of 1996. Aerospatiale expects to sell 50,000 Eryx missiles 
between now and the end of 1988.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "French Cruise Missiles With </F>
Conventional or Nuclear Warheads"; introductory paragraph in 
boldface as published] 
  [Text] American, Russian, and French (Matra) missile 
manufacturers are vying to dominate the market for "upscale" 
interceptor missiles. In France, Aerospatiale and Matra are 
dueling over a conventional cruise missile with a range of 400 
km. But Aerospatiale is also working on a long-range supersonic 
nuclear air-to-surface missile (ASLP) whose first launchings 
will take place in 1996-1997. 
  Aerospatiale Missiles and Matra Defense are competing to 
produce an air-to-surface cruise missile with conventional 
warhead that will be offered to the French Air Force as an 
"anti-infrastructure" missile for use against tactical, 
strategic, or even "political" targets as an "inhibiting warning 
shot." Each firm has already received a 20-million-franc 
contract for preliminary studies. But they have also invested 
their own money in this new missile, development of which could 
begin in 1994. 
  Matra Defense is proposing a missile derived from the 
subsonic air-to-surface Apache and known as the Apache-C, while 
Aerospatiale is putting its money on an adaptation of the 
medium-range nuclear air-to-surface missile (ASMP), whose 
nuclear warhead has been replaced by a conventional payload in 
this new version known as the ASMP-C (see AIR &amp; COSMOS Nos. 
1429 
and 1432). 
  The ASMP-C would be lighter (885 kg) than the Apache-C 
(1,230 
kg) and would also carry a smaller payload (240 kg compared to 
400 kg). But Aerospatiale's missile (propelled by a ramjet with 
integrated-powder booster) is supersonic and thus from two to 
three times faster (Mach 2.2 to 2.3) than the subsonic 
turbojet-propelled Apache (Mach 0.8). In other words, the ASMP-C 
would take only seven minutes to cover the maximum range of 400 
km, compared to 32 minutes for the Apache-C. According to their 
manufacturers, both missiles (with varying degrees of stealth 
capability) are equally accurate in the final phase (to within 
one to three meters). 
  Actually, the "conventional" ASMP retains the rear and 
middle 
sections of the original air-to-surface missile with no 
modification. Only the forward tip is replaced by a "hardened" 
payload from the AS30L and a guidance system with computer and 
infrared homing head adapted from the one used on an air-to-air 
missile developed by the SAT. 
  According to the project's chief engineer--who asked to 
remain anonymous--the only genuinely new component is in fact 
the onboard computer (adapted for ground attack), whose specific 
image processing software was developed jointly by Aerospatiale 
and the SAT. Those firms are awaiting notification early in 1994 
that they can begin a program for demonstrating the feasibility 
of the missile's guidance system in both the inertial and then 
the self-guided phase and in its different attack trajectories 
(flight profile at high and/or low altitude). This will be done 
using digital simulations and demonstrations on a three-axis 
bench under the direction of Aerospatiale in cooperation with 
the LRBA [Ballistic and Aerodynamic Research Laboratory]. 
  In particular, it will be necessary to test a computer 
mockup 
(with parallel architecture and prewired operators) and a 
prototype homing head (mechanical scanning) with a liquid 
nitrogen-cooled infrared detector (3-5 microns). According to 
the project manager, plans call for testing the guidance system 
on the ground for a year before testing it in flight (on an 
aircraft) for 1.5 years. But, he says, "if we were given 
authorization tomorrow for a demonstration program with ground 
targets, we would be ready to launch guided missiles within 18 
months!" 
  The reason is that the ASMP-C could benefit from synergy 
with 
the "mid-life modernization" program covering the ASMP missiles 
that went into service between 1986 and 1991 (there are over 80 
of them). That program, which will last for several years, 
should begin in 1994, and according to a recent Senate report, 
it will keep the ASMP's operational until 2007. 
  According to Aerospatiale, the ASMP-C could therefore be 
developed more quickly and less expensively than the Apache-C, 
whose development cost is estimated at "less than 1 billion 
francs" by Matra. According to the project manager, 
"Aerospatiale's missile would be easier to develop because it 
employs a simpler propulsion system (ramjet) and does not 
require mid-flight correction." The Apache-C, on the other hand, 
uses dual-mode guidance with an infrared camera for the final 
resetting of Thomson-CSF's Promethee radar. 
  Aerospatiale also feels that its missile, "like any ramjet 
missile, would be less expensive to manufacture than the Apache 
in equal quantities and at the same rate of production." 
Aerospatiale estimated earlier that for a limited production run 
(from 200 to 300 missiles), the ASMP-C would cost 10 million 
francs per unit, whereas Matra placed the cost of the Apache-C 
at 6 million francs (see AIR &amp; COSMOS Nos. 1429 and 1432). 
  Aerospatiale is also proposing to use the ramjet 
air-to-surface missile as the basis for an entire family of 
airborne supersonic missiles with a range of 400 km. That family 
would consist of the ASMP-R--an anti-AWACS aircraft/radar 
missile equipped with a dual-mode (active and passive) radar 
homing head produced by Dassault Electronic--and the ASMP-M, 
which would be equipped with the radar homing head used on the 
Exocet Mk2 and the same warhead as that used on the ANS 
[supersonic antiship missile]. The French Navy seems interested 
in that supersonic antiship (actually multirole) missile, and it 
is thought that Germany might even join (again) in its 
development. The technical dossier is to be submitted to the DGA 
[General Delegation for Weapons] at the start of 1994! 
  The ASMP-C can be launched from various platforms (aircraft, 
ships, submarines, or vehicles) and modified (by lengthening the 
fuel tank) to increase its range (+800 km from a high-altitude 
launch) in a slightly heavier version (about 1,050 kg). Matra is 
also proposing a version of the Apache-C with a longer range 
(+600 km). 
  Concerning the current Apache (air-to-surface with a range 
of 
140 km), Matra has announced that test flights of complete 
missiles (propelled, guided, and with submunitions ejected) will 
begin at the CEL [Landes Testing Center] in mid-1994 using a 
Mirage-2000 from the Flight Test Center. The company points out 
that the missile will be certified for the Mirage-2000D in 1996 
and available in mass-produced quantities at the start of 1997. 
<H3>  In-Flight Launchings in 1996-1997 of the ASLP Nuclear Cruise 
Missile </H3>
  The project to develop the ASLP, a nuclear-armed supersonic 
cruise missile, has not been abandoned. This despite the recent 
British decision to withdraw from the strategic nuclear 
air-to-surface missile project, which France was hoping to 
develop jointly with Great Britain as a replacement for Great 
Britain's 80 to 100 WE177 airborne atomic bombs and France's 
ASMP medium-range air-to-surface missiles. 
  AIR &amp; COSMOS has learned that the DGA gave its approval 
early 
in December for continuing exploratory development work on the 
ASLP. That work has been in progress since 1987. 
  The chief engineer for Aerospatiale's nuclear missile 
program--who wishes to remain anonymous--confirmed to us that 
the government agency had asked the firm to begin a four-year 
exploratory development program to produce complete missiles and 
to conduct the first flight tests with that platform (without a 
nuclear warhead) in 1996-1997. 
  On that subject, a recent Senate report authored by Senator 
Jacques Golliet expresses the feeling that "flexibility of the 
airborne component is particularly well adapted to the strategic 
situation and to changes in the threat at the operational and 
political levels." And further on that subject, Golliet notes 
that "many factors (ramjet performance, accuracy, stealth, 
multirole capability, suitability for strategic or prestrategic 
missions, and a desire to upgrade the Rafale) argue in favor of 
developing and having ready by around 2005 or 2007 a successor 
to the ASMP that will have a longer range and carry a nuclear 
warhead ranging from a few kilotons to 300 kT." 
  The report also recommends "rounding out the components of 
our nuclear potential by the addition of a cruise missile 
equipped with a low-powered or variable-energy nuclear warhead 
or even one with dual capability: both nuclear and 
conventional," like the U.S. Tomahawk. 
  Aerospatiale has already designed an ASLP version carrying a 
conventional warhead. According to the project's chief engineer, 
"it would be possible by around 2010 or 2015 to have a cruise 
missile that is completely autonomous (requiring not even GPS 
correction) and accurate to within a few meters, with a range 
four or five times greater than that of the ASMP." The ASMP has 
a range of from 150 to 300 km, depending on launch altitude.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "First Launching of Aster 30 </F>
Antimissile Missile From Ground Launcher"; introductory 
paragraph in boldface as published] 
  [Text] Vertical launching from the Alenia launcher 
has been validated with the first ejection launching of 
Aerospatiale's surface-to-air missile, while tests of Thomson's 
Arabel fire control system are beginning at the SESDA 
[Experimental Air Defense System Station]. 
  Aerospatiale and Eurosam have just made the very first 
flight 
test launch of an Aster 30 surface-to-air missile. The missile 
was also launched for the first time from the Aster 30 ground 
missile launcher that will make up the future anti-aircraft and 
antimissile weapon system known as the Medium-Range 
Surface-to-Air Ground Missile (SAMP/T). The launch took place on 
1 December under the responsibility of Aerospatiale, the prime 
contractor for Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles, at the Landes 
Testing Center (CEL) operated by the General Delegation for 
Weapons (DGA). 
  The two-stage solid-fuel missile--using the same 
Aerospatiale 
terminal delivery system (in the second stage), but with a 
booster from Italy's BPD (in the first stage) that is larger in 
the Aster 30 version than in Aster 15--was launched from one of 
the eight canister tubes of the missile launcher developed by 
Alenia in cooperation with OTO Melara (Italy). The Aster 30 in 
that configuration is five meters long and weighs 460 kg. 
  The test, which was conducted using the unguided missile, 
made it possible to validate the vertical launch procedure for 
the Aster 30 (the procedure for the Aster 15 had already been 
validated). Earlier, Aerospatiale had validated the performance 
of the terminal missile with maximum-range launchings in 
particular and had also conducted flight tests making it 
possible to test trajectory formatting and the performance of 
the direct-force and aerodynamic control system (PIF-PAF). In 
all, according to Eurosam, there had already been a dozen or so 
launchings of propelled and/or guided missiles (but without 
Dassault Electronics' electromagnetic homing head) as well as 
firings from the naval launcher during flight tests conducted 
between 1987 and 1992. 
  The test just completed also made it possible to test the 
various subassemblies--missile, canister-launch tube, and ground 
launch ramp--in the SAMP/T's operational configuration. The only 
difference was that the missile launcher was not mounted on a 
truck but simply placed on the ground on a firing range at the 
Landes Testing Center in Biscarosse. But the Aster 30 will be 
launched from a launcher mounted on a ground vehicle during the 
next two scheduled launchings--also at the CEL--in 1994. 
  In another connection, Eurosam has announced that the first 
prototype (P01) of the Arabel fire control radar was accepted at 
the Bagneux plant of the manufacturer, Thomson-CSF, in November. 
That electronic scanning radar will be used in a series of 
technical tests in a marine environment that are scheduled for 
1994 at the SESDA in Saint-Mandrier near Toulon. 
  The Arabel will then be combined with the Alenia missile 
launcher for sea trials involving launchings from the 
experimental ship Ile d'Oleron. Those tests will be conducted 
with the Aster 15 in the configuration adopted for the future 
SAAM [surface-to-air antimissile] naval weapon that will be used 
by the French and Italian Navies. According to Eurosam, the SAAM 
will first be used in actual service on the French aircraft 
carrier Charles de Gaulle, whose sea trials are scheduled for 
1999. The Aster 30 will be used by those same navies as well as 
the French Air Force (replacing its Hawks), with the SAMP/T that 
will be delivered for tests in 1998. Both missiles--the Aster 15 
and the Aster 30--will also be used with new radars in the 
future naval PAMS system scheduled for 2002.

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK Science and Engineering Research </F>
Council: "Half Million Pound Boost For Coal Research"] 
  [Text] An agreement between the Science and Engineering 
Research Council (SERC) and the Department of Trade and Industry 
(DTI) has been signed which provides an additional 500,000 
pounds for coal research in UK universities. 
  An important part of the DTI's Coal R&amp;D programme, 
managed by 
the Coal Team of Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU), will be 
the contribution of more than 500,000 pounds towards a 
collaborative programme on coal research. In addition, ETSU's 
Coal Team will provide active monitoring of a portfolio of 
coal-related research grants to ensure the full potential of the 
research is realised and disseminated as widely as possible. 
  Further information can be obtained from: Dr Neil Pratt, 
Process Engineering Committee, SERC, Polaris House, North Star 
Avenue, Swindon SN2 1ET, Tel: 0793 411484, Fax 0793 411020; The 
Coal Programme Manager, ETSU, Harwell, Oxfordshire, OX11 0RA; 
Tel: 0235 432669, Fax 0235 432753 
<H5>  Notes For Editors </H5>
  1. DTI made a brief reference to the programme in press 
release P/93/287 dated 27/5/93. 
  2. The programme will continue under EPSRC after 1 April 
1994. 
  3. Funds and manpower made available from ETSU will enhance 
the commitment SERC makes to coal and related research which 
currently stands at around 1 million pounds per annum. 
  4. Since 1 April 1990, the Coal Team at ETSU have undertaken 
programme management responsibility for the DTI's Coal R&amp;D 
programme. This responsibility entails providing necessary 
technical support in the preparation and development of 
strategy, and the recruitment, assessment, contracting and 
management of R&amp;D projects. The Coal Team comprises of 
Project 
Managers supported by administration, contracts, finance and 
technology transfer personnel, all of whom report to the Coal 
Programme Manager. 
  A significant aspect of the DTI's Coal R&amp;D programme is 
the 
support of fundamental research at Higher Education Institutes 
[HEI] of relevance to the development of clean coal 
technologies. Co-operation between HEIs, research institutes and 
industry in this research area has increased considerably over 
recent years, and the Coal R&amp;D programme seeks to encourage 
this 
trend. Closer interaction enables industry to become 
increasingly aware of the capabilities of the HEIs and, 
consequently, to identify centres of expertise that are best 
suited to address specific research problems. In turn, HEIs are 
able to recognise more clearly industrial requirements and focus 
their research programmes accordingly. 
  Fundamental coal science research is an international 
activity and it is important that UK research takes account of 
international developments and wherever possible is 
complementary in its approach. A priority for the Coal R&amp;D 
programme is to continue to encourage UK coal researchers to 
derive maximum benefit from participation in international 
programmes. 
  Under the SERC/DTI Scheme, the responsibilities of the SERC 
are: 
  -- to undertake peer review according to usual practice; 
  -- to award grants according to the standard SERC procedures 
and subject to normal SERC terms and conditions, except where 
modified to take account of the monitoring and dissemination 
activities of ETSU; 
  -- to manage all financial aspects of supported projects. 
  The responsibilities of ETSU are: 
  -- to assess all coal-related applications to the SERC and 
advise the appropriate SERC Committee of the DTI's priority for 
funding (based on the relevance of each application to 
identified priority areas of the DTI's Coal R&amp;D programme); 
  -- to monitor actively the progress of research supported 
under the Scheme, through meetings between the Grant Holder and 
the ETSU Project Manager (usually at the Grant Holder's 
institution), typically held six-monthly; 
  -- to enhance dissemination of basic information and results 
from each research project supported through the publication by 
ETSU of Project Profiles, Project Summaries and/or Final Reports.

  [Text] Rome, (ANSA) 17 Jan -- ENEA [National Agency for 
New Technologies, Energy and the Environment] and the Ministry 
for Universities and Scientific Research have signed an 
agreement for a program, with funding of over 40 billion lire 
(to be precise 42) over three years, for research covering the 
entire environmental field. One of the four chapters of the 
document is dedicated to the environment (the other three deal 
with new technologies, Italian participation in the European 
fusion program, and the development of the technical-scientific 
support services at the ministry). According to the signatories 
to the agreement, it will constitute a fundamental instrument 
for the reinforcement of collaboration between the two bodies, 
directing resources to the realization of projects with precise 
goals. For the three years 1992/1995 the total resources amount 
to 400 billion lire. 
  There are plans for the diffusion of advanced technologies 
relating to the environment and for participation in 
wide-ranging initiatives that already are in existence, such as 
the national plan for environmental research and the Community's 
EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] program. Some 
sectors of intervention have however already been singled out. 
In fact models showing climatic changes will be prepared. This 
is a subject in which Italy is historically behind, and 
technologies will be developed to reduce impacts on the 
environment and manage the various types of monitoring. The 
research will mainly concern the Mediterranean Sea, natural 
risks to the environment (earthquakes, soil erosion), water 
resources and radioprotection.

<F P=106> [Article signed Catherine Moulin, Pierre Cote, Michel </F>
Mercier: "Nanofiltration: The Future of Water"] 
  [Text] Nanofiltration is a membrane technique complying 
with a number of limitations, such as the erosion of resources, 
increasing demand, the safety of supply networks, and drinking 
water quality, while presenting more than one advantage. A 
prototype station is supplying the inhabitants of 
Auvers-sur-Oise. They are the first people to drink water 
treated by nanofiltration which is softened and has no taste of 
chlorine. 
  The development of membrane techniques, which made their 
first appearance in water treatment some 10 years ago, is based 
on various factors. These include increasingly severe 
legislation governing the quality of drinking water, the need to 
take into account any possible side effects of treatment due to 
the addition of reagents, the erosion of resources, and the 
technological progress made to make these processes competitive. 
  Nanofiltration, which bridges the gap between 
ultrafiltration 
and reverse osmosis, complies with the new standards for 
drinking water. It gives precise control over the quality of the 
water produced. Other points in its favor are its compactness 
and the simplicity with which it can be used, checked, and 
maintained. 
<H5>  The Membrane Barrier </H5>
  The term nanofiltration is used for membranes that have a 
molecular weight removal threshold for organic compounds of 
close to 250 daltons. This corresponds to the hypothetical 
existence of pores 1 nm in diameter. These composite-type 
membranes are formed of a hydrophobic support bearing positively 
charged hydrophilic chemical groups. In this way, the 
traditional properties of an ultrafiltration membrane are 
strengthened by a repulsive force enabling the removal of 
similarly charged ionic species and their counterions. It is 
these groups that are responsible for the ionic action of the 
nanofiltration membranes -- bivalent species are held back at a 
rate varying from 70-90 percent, making it an excellent process 
for water softening (the removal of Calcium, Ca 2+ 
[superscript], and magnesium, Mg 2+ [superscript], both 
responsible for water hardness) and desulfurization (removal of 
SO4 2- [superscript]), while the retention rate for monovalent 
ions is lower (less than 60%). 
<H5>  Less Chlorine in the Networks </H5>
  These membranes are also an excellent physical barrier to 
small dissolved molecules and micropollutants such as Atrazine. 
They are particularly effective at removing trihalomethane 
precursors and humic and fulvic acids. 
  Another aspect of nanofiltration membranes is their capacity 
to retain organic matter. They remove the dissolved 
biodegradable organic carbon which is the part of dissolved 
organic carbon that feeds the bacteria in supply networks. 
Removing it avoids the development of biofilms and therefore 
reduces the final rate of chlorination normally used to 
disinfect networks. 
  Lastly, these membranes operate at pressures of less than 10 
bars. They therefore couple the ionic advantages of reverse 
osmosis with the low operating pressures and consequently 
reduced energy consumption of ultrafiltration. 
<H5>  The Mery 400,000 Project </H5>
  The Ile-de-France water syndicate [SEDIF] supplies drinking 
water to 144 communes in the Paris region, representing four 
million inhabitants. It is continuing in its efforts to counter 
the erosion of resources and to conserve the same water quality 
throughout the supply network in a region of growing demand. 
This has already been achieved for the treatment processes in 
its two largest production plants at Neuilly-sur-Marne and 
Choisy-le-Roi (800,000 m3/day). 
  The Mery 400,000 project is the opportunity to research into 
both water production and distribution. At the suggestion of 
its administrator, the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE], SEDIF 
has set itself the goal of increasing the capacity of the 
Mery-sur-Oise plant from 270,000 m3 to 400,000 m3 per day. Fed 
by the river Oise, this plant now treats water for 600,000 
inhabitants. The main stages in the treatment system are: 
preozonation and storage; coagulation and settling; biological 
sand filtration; ozonation and biological filtration on granular 
activated carbon; postozonation; and finally postchlorination 
before distribution. 
<H5>  Nanofiltration At Work </H5>
  After an initial study into the different processes that 
could be used to achieve this aim, SEDIF and CGE wanted to test 
nanofiltration by building a prototype plant with a capacity of 
2,800 m3/day on the Mery-sur-Oise site. 
  The membranes in nanofiltration are packed in spiral 
modules. 
This kind of module has a small dead zone and a relatively low 
investment cost. On the other hand, it is very sensitive to 
clogging and requires quite exhaustive pretreatment. Two sheets 
of membrane are placed on either side of a spacer material. The 
three sheets are sealed along three sides to form an envelope. 
The open side is attached to a perforated tube that collects 
the treated water. The envelope is then wrapped around the tube 
with a spacer generating turbulence on the concentrate side. 
The rolls of membrane are placed inside a pressure tube with a 
system of joints at either end ensuring its watertightness. In 
normal operation, the water to be treated circulates in the 
interstices formed by the spacer. Pressure forces some of the 
water to penetrate the inside of the envelope and to collect in 
the central tube. 
<H5>  Portrait of a Treatment System </H5>
  The use of membranes, the choice of operating conditions 
(pressure, tangential velocity, temperature, conversion level, 
etc.), and the correct match of pretreatment system to modules 
are all of vital importance if system performance is to be 
maintained for as long as possible. The stages in a 
nanofiltration treatment system are: pretreatment of the raw 
water (settling, sand filtration, and 5 5m safety prefilters); 
acid conditioning of the raw water to prevent the precipitation 
of carbonates and of calcium and magnesium hydroxides; 
conditioning by chelating agent for sulfate salts (CaSO2, etc.); 
pressurization using a pump; nanofiltration; post-treatment of 
the treated water, consisting of restoring the carbonate balance 
and, if necessary, remineralizing the raw water (often a simple 
aeration is sufficient); and final chlorination. 
  With a degree of economic and technological progress, we can 
envisage the chosen solution producing water with a very low 
dissolved, biodegradable organic matter content, and that is 
free from pathogens, and softened. This solution also makes it 
possible to reduce the number of treatment stages, since water 
polishing by nanofiltration replaces the stages of ozonation and 
biological filtration on granular activated carbon. 
<H5>  The Water at Auvers-sur-Oise </H5>
  Started up in July 1992, the nanofiltration prototype has 
been supplying the commune of Auvers-sur-Oise (6,000 
inhabitants) since February 1993, with the agreement of the 
health ministry and the French council for public hygiene. 
  The water entering the prototype still contains 3.6 mg/l of 
dissolved organic carbon, approximately one third of which (1.1 
mg/l) is biodegradable and could benefit the regrowth of 
bacteria in the distribution network. Its chlorine demand, in 
the region of three mg/l may lead to the formation of byproducts 
such as chloroform (CHCL3), trihalomethanes (THM), and total 
organohalogens (TOX). One half of the organic matter in the 
water supplying the prototype is composed of humic substances. 
The other major components are hydrophilic acids (30 percent), 
carboxylic acids (five to eight percent), and carbohydrates 
(five to ten percent). In addition, 75 percent of the dissolved 
organic carbon has a molecular weight of less than 5,000 
daltons, much of which (25 percent) has a molecular weight of 
less than 500 daltons. This justifies the use of nanofiltration 
membranes with a removal threshold in the order of 250 daltons. 
  The water produced after nanofiltration is of a very high 
quality. Ninety percent of the dissolved organic carbon is 
removed and the dissolved biodegradable organic carbon 
concentration is less than the detection limit (0.1 mg/l). The 
chlorine is no longer consumed by the organic matter and remains 
at a more stable level in the network. The two effects are 
complementary: the low concentration in biodegradable organic 
matter and the chlorine stability make it easier to protect the 
network against bacterial contamination. 
  It was possible to confirm this on the Auvers-sur-Oise 
distribution network which is supplied with nanofiltered water. 
A low residual chlorine level at the plant outlet (0.1 mg/l) 
was sufficient to keep the water within the bacteriological 
standards. 
  Nanofiltration is therefore considered a leading candidate 
for doubling the Mery-sur-Oise plant's capacity. It presents a 
number of advantages: the production of water free from 
pathogenic micro-organisms, a reduced level of dissolved 
biodegradable organic carbon, the notable possibility of 
reducing the level of chlorination before distribution and thus 
the production of water free from chlorination byproducts, the 
removal of micropollutants such as pesticides, and the reduction 
of bivalent ions (hardness and sulfates). The inhabitants of 
Auvers are the first European consumers of water produced using 
this innovative process. There is no doubt that it will find 
its place in modern water treatment systems.

<F P=106> [Article signed Paula Ceccaldi: "A New Generation of Water </F>
Treatment Plants"] 
  [Text] Space-saving, 10 times more efficient, 10 times 
faster and what's more, European -- that is the definition of 
the rapid waste water treatment process developed by the 
Corporation for the Treatment and Economic Development of Water 
[OTV], a subsidiary of the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE]. 
The process is the result of the joint work done by its 
research center and two European partners, one Danish and the 
other Swiss. 
  Grassed over at Antibes, buried in Monaco in the basement of 
an apartment block, or integrated into a building like at Cergy 
(near Paris), the water treatment plant for the year 2000 is 
already operational. The Cergy plant, designed to purify the 
effluent of a town of 200,000 inhabitants, daily treats some 
40,000 cubic meters of wastewater. 
  The standards laid out in the European wastewater directive 
of 1991 set new limits for nitrogen con10t (less than 10 mg/l) 
and phosphorus con10t (less than 1.5 mg/l) of urban wastewater, 
and the conformity of treatment results -- 95 percent must 
comply at any given time. 
  Existing processes could only achieve these results with 
great difficulty. Firstly, it would be necessary to multiply by 
at least four the surface area of existing plants operating 
using activated sludge, such as the one at Acheres which treats 
the wastewater of Paris and its region. This is unimaginable in 
its urban location. Secondly, the control method would have to 
be changed to a process of continual analysis: until now 
results have been expressed as a daily average. 
  In 1990, in order to meet these new pollution removal 
thresholds, the CGE (OTV and Anjou Research) teamed up for three 
years in a Eureka [European scientific research program] project 
with the Danish company Danfoss, specializing in sensors, and 
with Eawag, the Swiss water institute, expert in modeling 
bioprocesses applied to water. 
  Chris10ed Simbiose (scientific improvements of biofilters 
and 
sensors), the aim of this project was to reply to the European 
water treatment standards with new, high-speed treatment 
processes. Taking up only small areas, they would simplify the 
integration of treatment plants in urban areas. Moreover, the 
use of continuous sensors would make it possible to control the 
system automatically and would give a water quality permanently 
in line with the above- mentioned European standards. The total 
cost of the project was 70 million French francs [Fr], Fr30 
million of which came from France -- Fr20 million from the CGE 
and 10 million from the French government. Frank Rogalla, 
deputy director of the CGE's research center, noted with 
satisfaction that "the program was completed in June 1993, and 
most of the aims were met." 
<H5>  Useful Experience Gained </H5>
  To meet the esthetic requirements where the environment is 
concerned and to resolve the problem of more restricted space in 
and around towns, OTV had already implemented new pollution 
removal systems. In this way the company acquired experience 
with a process using fixed bacteria beds that concentrated the 
biomass and thus removed the need for clarification equipment. 
As early as 1982, its Biocarbone process had coupled biology 
and phase separation in the same reactor. Here the biological 
purification of water is done by downward percolation through a 
fixed submerged bed, with air injected in the lower section. 
Already five times smaller than traditional, activated sludge 
reactors, it does however require two units for complete 
purification of wastewater in accordance with the new nitrogen 
removal standards -- one for the anoxic stage and the other for 
the aerobic stage. It is also necessary to clean the filters 
from time to time. 
<H5>  The New Generation of Biofilters </H5>
  The process developed in the Simbiose project, chris10ed 
Biostyr, made the disadvantages of Biocarbone appear negligible. 
  Expanded polystyrene balls are used instead of the mineral 
support. Since they float, they are kept down by a board. 
Frank Rogalla stressed: "The choice of a synthetic material 
enables us to retain tight control over the physical parameters 
(density, granulometry, etc.) and to alter the selected 
characteristics to suit the required treatment performance." 
  The pollution flows through the filter from bottom to top. 
The wastewater is pumped to a higher level and injected in by 
gravity flow. The two zones, aerobic and anoxic, are thus 
brought together in the same reactor. The air is injected into 
the middle of the bed, meaning that the anoxic zone is in the 
lower section and the aerobic zone is in the upper section. 
Backwashing by gravity flow is a sufficient washing technique. 
  10 times less space is needed for this type of installation 
than for a conventional plant. Re10tion time has also been 
divided by 10, reduced from 24 hours to just two to three hours. 
<H5>  Miniaturization of Sensors And Automated Control </H5>
  This new generation of high-performance biofilters, however, 
was just one part of the Simbiose project. The other two parts 
dealt with sensors and the automated control of this new 
generation of water treatment plant. 
  The sensor part was the responsibility of the Danish company 
Danfoss. It was charged with designing equipment to continually 
measure nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Work was based on 
existing sensors using colorimetric methods, which Danfoss then 
improved and miniaturized. A prototype sensor is now being 
tested. The installations currently being produced by OTV will 
use conventional sensors until the miniaturized versions become 
available. Bioreactor and automated process management modeling 
is still at the experimental stage. 
  The Simbiose project time has been ex10ded to ensure the 
achievement of all the aims set out in 1990. The European 
directive requires all existing installations and processes to 
be brought in line with the standards, with all towns of more 
than 2,000 inhabitants complying by 2005.

<F P=106> [Article by Umberto Torelli: "A Robot is even Working in </F>
the Greenhouse"] 
  [Text] We are used to robot butlers, and to robots that do 
dangerous jobs underground, as well as those inside stores where 
explosives are kept. A robotic manipulator that is just as able 
to perform operations as the surgeon and uses remote control 
techniques has also been experimented. This time robotics is 
being applied to agriculture. The robot "farmer" project 
started at the Agrobot consortium, a pool of university centers 
and companies working in the sector engaged in the CNR [Italian 
National Research Council] finalized robotics project. 
  The body of the system, which is designed to work in the 
greenhouse for the time being, is made up of a strong 
caterpillar vehicle that can move about, and also serve as a bed 
on which the produce that has been harvested can be carried. An 
anthromorphic arm, which can translate and rotate operating with 
six grades of restraint between ground level and 1.5 meters 
above ground level, is fixed onto the upper base. 
  The manipulation system is made up of three fingers and lies 
at the end of the arm. It is entrusted with the job of 
delicately grasping the produce that is to be picked and this is 
not simple. The articulated phalanges of each finger are able to 
assess the consistency of the object being handled with extreme 
precision, just like the human hand, and evaluate the force that 
should be applied to take hold of it. 
  Finally there is the vision system. It is as sophisticated 
as ever and uses a pair of stereo color television cameras. 
These artificial eyes are given the delicate task of evaluating 
the size of the obstacles that are met and this information is 
used to give the correct navigational instructions. But this is 
not all. The robot can pinpoint the position of the fruits or 
vegetables with millimetric precision and evaluate the 
tonalities of their color. 
  In this way it manages to identify flowers for hormone 
treatment, select the position of fruits to be treated, and 
above all select the harvest with precision on the basis of the 
grade of color and the consistency of the pulp. Naturally, it 
is easy to program the robot so that it picks the fruit that has 
the weight and form required, then places it in boxes, in rows, 
with the stalks facing in the same direction. 
  "At present greenhouse produce is harvested all at once, 
often picking produce in different stages of maturation," says 
Giulio Sandini of the University of Genoa DIST (Department of 
Information Science). 
  "With the advent of robotics all the produce is separately 
picked, assuring the correct grade of maturity. We must also 
consider the reduction made in the quantity of chemicals used. 
Now, when parasites are present, it is necessary to spray the 
whole area, in the future the robot system will be able to 
locate the individual plants that are affected and treat them 
separately."

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Rodgers: "FELIX Opens for Business"] </F>
  [Text] United Kingdom researchers are to receive 20 
percent of the beam time on the FELIX free electron laser at the 
Dutch Institute for Plasma Physics "Rijnhuizen" in Nieuwegein 
for the next two years. The agreement was signed at the 
inauguration of FELIX last month and the beam time is payment in 
kind for two United Kingdom-built undulators. The undulators 
were intended for a British free electron laser project that was 
cancelled in 1987. The Rijnhuizen laboratory is part of the 
Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM). 
  Work on FELIX started in 1987. The Dutch Ministry of 
Education and Science paid 13.4 million Dutch guilders [FL] 
(about 5.7 million pounds) capital costs and is spending another 
FL4 million per year to turn FELIX into an international user 
facility - the agreement with the United Kingdom is the first 
step. FELIX actually started operating in 1991 and the first 
experiments started late in 1992. According to FELIX project 
leader Wim van Amersfoort, the facility is oversubscribed by 
more than a factor of two. The plan is to operate FELIX 42 
weeks of the year (16 hours a day, five days per week) and the 
annual running costs are expected to be about FL3.5 million. 
  A free electron laser (FEL) is a cross between a synchrotron 
and a laser. Synchrotron radiation is produced when a beam of 
relativistic electrons is forced to oscillate in a magnetic 
field. The core of a FEL is an undulator, a device that produces 
more intense synchrotron radiation than other arrangements of 
magnets. If mirrors are placed at each end of the undulator, the 
radiation can be stored in the resulting cavity and made 
coherent. Bunched electrons travel through the undulator, 
amplifying radiation produced by previous bunches. One of the 
mirrors is partially reflecting to allow the FEL radiation to 
escape from the cavity. 
  FELIX operates between 6 and 110 microns in the infrared and 
is used for experiments in atomic physics, molecular physics and 
chemistry, solid-state physics, surface physics and chemistry, 
medicine and biomolecular spectroscopy. The wavelength is tuned 
by changing the electron energy or the magnetic field in the 
undulator. It is tunability over a wide range of wavelengths 
that give FELs their advantage over other radiation sources. 
  FELIX actually has two undulators and two linear 
accelerators. Its output consists of micropulses - infrared 
pulses with durations between 0.5 and 10 picoseconds and peak 
powers of 10 megawatts. The micropulses are separated by 1 
nanosecond and form macropulses which can last as long as 6 
microseconds and contain thousands of micropulses. There are 
between six and ten macropulses per second. 
  Twenty percent of the time on FELIX will be used for 
studying 
FELs themselves. The FOM group plans to produce micropulses 
with durations of hundreds of femtoseconds and to extend the 
wavelength range to 300 microns - shorter wavelengths in the 1 
to 20 microns range are already covered by the CLIO free 
electron laser at Orsay in France. 
  Rijnhuizen has also started work on a free electron maser 
(FEM) as a megawatt source of tunable millimetre waves. This 
would be used to heat and control magnetically-confined fusion 
plasmas in tokamaks. Completion of the FEM project, which is 
being carried out in collaboration with laboratories in the 
former Soviet Union, Russia and Germany, is expected in 1995.

  [Excerpts] This year, the Juelich Research Center awarded 
its prizes for outstanding doctoral theses to the electronics 
and semiconductor engineering sectors. One of the criteria for 
the awards is whether the candidates have presented their 
findings in a readily comprehensible form. [passage omitted] 
  Gerd Fuhrmann, working in the Juelich Research Center's 
Central Electronics Laboratory, developed a laboratory 
microtomography system that can be used, in conjunction with a 
computer, to make the entire three-dimensional structure of a 
sample visible without previous preparation. He exploited the 
scanning electron microscope's high-current electron beam, 
which, if directed onto a metal cutting edge [Metallschneide], 
generates an x-ray beam, which is passed through the sample 
under inspection. According to the material of which the object 
under inspection consists and its thickness, the x-ray beam is 
attenuated (absorbed), and the absorption, or the energy loss 
resulting therefrom, is measured behind the sample in special 
detectors. 
<H5>  Details From Inside the Object </H5>
  A computer is then used to reconstruct the inner structures 
of the sample according to the computer tomography process, 
achieving unprecedented resolution. Details of bones, tumor 
tissue, or industrial materials down to a size of less than 5 
micrometers (five-thousandths of a millimeter) can thus be 
displayed and distinguished. However, this involves evaluating 
and processing large quantities of data from the numerous 
detectors by sophisticated procedures. The microtomography 
system can be used anywhere where interference-free inspection 
of the inner structures of small samples is required: for pores 
and cracks in ceramics or fiber-reinforced composites, for 
airbag sensor tests, for measuring oil-water mix permeation of 
porous rock in mineral oil research, or for examining bone 
specimens for medical purposes. Fuhrmann demonstrated his 
development with an examination of tiny living beings, 
displaying the inside of a fly's head. It was possible to 
identify tubes leading from the mouthpart into the trunk of the 
body. 
  "Electrons in the Overtaking Lane" is the title that Frank 
Mueller gave his doctoral thesis, in which he addressed problems 
encountered in highly compressed semiconductors. Unlike 
nonconducting insulators and metals, which are good conductors 
of electricity, semiconductors are materials in which the flow 
of free electrons can be controlled. As "ideal" semiconductors 
have no free charge carriers, however, foreign atoms with an 
excess of electrons must first be built into the semiconductor 
material, a process referred to as "doping." 
<H5>  Foreign Atoms Becoming a Problem </H5>
  These foreign atoms are becoming something of a problem in 
the quest for faster and faster devices. As they pass through 
the semiconductor, the electrons are repelled by the positively 
charged atom and thus take a sort of zigzag course. Separating 
the electrons from the doping atoms in space helps: The 
semiconductor material is slowly vapor-deposited -- atomic layer 
by atomic layer -- onto a substrate; very precise junctions 
between the different semiconductor materials can be obtained by 
changing the deposition material abruptly. The free electrons 
tend to remain on the interface layer between the different 
semiconductor materials and can thus be separated from the 
doping atoms. Ideally, they then fly in a perfectly straight 
line. However, as no semiconductor material can be made 
entirely without impurities, what really happens is somewhat 
different: Electrons continue to be diverted by collisions. 
Frank Mueller wanted to measure this deviation, so he built a 
barrier into the electrons' race track -- the interface between 
gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide. The barrier 
only lets the electrons through at a very narrow point, the 
emitter, behind which there is a collector to catch the 
electrons arriving in a straight line. Electrons deviated by 
collisions miss this collector. The greater the distance 
between the emitter and the collector, the greater the 
attenuation of the stream -- indeed, there are more collision 
centers on a longer path. The distances between the collision 
centers can now be measured to approximately one-ten-thousandth 
of a millimeter. The jury selected these two researchers, along 
with Christian Plass-Duelmer of the Institute of Geosphere 
Chemistry and Dynamics, who studied the significance of the 
oceans as a source of light hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, from 
a total of 24 candidates. Five theses came from information 
technology alone.

  [Text] For a long time the view that it is not possible to 
produce silicon-based optoelectronic devices was regarded as 
sacred lore. Unlike gallium arsenide, silicon does not 
luminesce when excited optically by electric current. This 
would now appear possible. 
  Scientists at the Juelich Research Center's Institute of 
Coating and Ion Technology have accomplished a major step in 
this direction. For the first time, porous silicon layers have 
been used to fabricate complex superlattice structures of a kind 
particularly suitable for filters or semireflecting mirrors in 
combination with a light-emitting porous silicon coating. 
  Porous silicon, which is produced in an electrochemical 
etching process, has a spongy structure. Although the process 
for producing porous silicon layers has been known since the 
mid-fifties, it was only three years ago, when a British 
research team observed intensive photoluminescence, that great 
interest in this material system sprang up worldwide, whereupon 
a frantic search for potential electroluminescence began, 
several teams finding it with some speed. In 
electroluminescence, electric current is used to trigger light 
emission. All optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting 
diodes and semiconductor lasers, are based on this mechanism. 
  Since then, more than 10 different models have been 
proposed, 
some based on the assumption that complex silicon-oxygen and 
silicon-hydrogen molecules exist. However, the Juelich Research 
Center, using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, performed a 
chemical analysis on freshly prepared porous layers detecting no 
sign of oxygen, and this finding is confirmed by infrared 
studies conducted jointly with the Physics Institute at the 
Rhine-Westphalian College of Technology in Aachen. Trials known 
as inelastic light scattering experiments performed in Juelich 
clearly confirmed that nanocrystallites are present in the 
porous layers. It is even possible to establish frequency 
distribution functions for the nanocrystallite diameters in the 
light of these results. A comparison of recorded 
photoluminescence spectra with the distribution functions has 
for the first time correlated the intensity of the 
photoluminescence with the number of nanocrystallites having a 
diameter of about 2.5 nanometers. These findings, which have 
been confirmed by other research teams, have demonstrated that 
the luminescence is definitely caused by the silicon 
nanocrystallites present in the porous layers. 
  Porous silicon normally emits light in photo- and 
electroluminescence over a broad spectrum comprising many colors 
in the visible range, although the user would obviously prefer 
to have more sharply defined light emission that could also be 
modified. The scientists at Juelich have now presented a 
completely new concept that uses what are known as porosity 
superlattices as filters. These porosity superlattices consist 
of a periodic sequence of layers of differing porosity. By 
selecting them according to the right parameters -- the 
thicknesses of the single layers ranged from 10 to 500 
nanometers (nm) with porosities up to and exceeding 83 percent 
-- they were able to produce narrow-band filters and, for 
example, use them to reduce the breadth of the photoluminescence 
band by a factor of more than 10. 
  These porosity superlattices also present an extremely high 
reflection factor of up to 95 percent in the visible spectral 
region, where only about 30 percent is observed with normal 
silicon layers. Porosity superlattices can be produced in the 
same process step as the active electroluminescence layer. 
Initial trials show, moreover, that porosity superlattices with 
lateral structures measuring about 150 micrometers can be 
produced. This is more or less the pixel (picture element) size 
of a flat video screen. In view of its extremely high 
light-emitting efficiency, porous silicon is currently applied 
on top of other, for instance silicon layer system, coatings. 
The application potential of porous silicon is enormous, far 
greater than can be fully appreciated at the present time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Troubleshooting With Neural Networks </F>
-- How Siemens Checks Chips;" first paragraph is COMPUTER 
ZEITUNG introduction] 
  [Text] The number of defects that can occur in the 
complicated circuitry when chips are being manufactured is hard 
to imagine, and they are difficult to detect. An inspection 
process with neural intelligence now recognizes faulty 
minimemories in a flash. 
  Who can imagine a number with a million zeros? Expressed in 
milligrams, the weight of the Earth needs a 30 digit number. 
The number of atoms in the entire universe has about 125 places 
- but a million? Siemens engineers have to get to grips with 
this giant number if properly working silicon chips are to leave 
the factory in Regensburg: In theory 2[.sup]4194304[/]-1 
reference patterns can occur in the production of a 4 megabit 
memory, a number with approximately 1.2 million digits. "Maps", 
better known as "bit-maps" showing specimen faulty memories are 
used to try to classify this almost infinite number of reference 
patterns in order to cut the time required for inspecting a 
silicon wafer with memory modules. 
  At first sight it is a never-ending task: How can this huge 
number of possible combinations be classified at all? 
Fortunately, the bit-map variants are similar in appearance. 
Someone with a sound background knowledge who "reads" the 
bit-maps for a long period of time can divide them into some 80 
to 100 risk allowance groups. This is an extraordinary 
achievement for the human brain. There is just one snag: Visual 
analysis takes up to 15 hours for every 6-inch silicon wafer. 
  Siemens in Regensburg has now optimized bit-map analysis of 
silicon wafers with neural networks. The computer uses pattern 
recognition to decide in which of the 80 or so risk allowance 
groups a defect found on a chip falls. The actual analysis is 
performed on a perfectly ordinary PC. One great advantage is 
that any new reference patterns that occur no longer have to be 
reprogrammed because the system "learns" them itself. And that 
is not all: Since most of the equipment used in chip manufacture 
has quite characteristic reference patterns, the system gives a 
specific alarm when faults of a particular risk allowance group 
accumulate in part of the wafer. This enables such "output 
killers" to be identified early. 
  The bit-map analysis system developed by Siemens' 
Semiconductor Division will also check 16 megabit and later 64 
megabit memories: The number of possible reference patterns in 
these memories is as much as 2[.sup]108864[/]-1. To write 
this number out would require a computer printout which, with 
the pages placed end to end, would be 100 kilometers long.

<F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "Superconductivity Outside the </F>
Low-Temperature Range"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Two CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research] 
research teams, one in Grenoble, the other in Paris, have 
observed electric conduction phenomena without any resistance in 
materials at temperatures close to 0 degrees Celsius [xC]. 
  No more overheating of electronic circuits, no more energy 
losses in electric cables... Soon, faster computers, smaller 
transformers, more efficient magnetometry instruments... In 
brief, a technological revolution with a market that is worth 
$1.5 billion (8.7 billion francs [Fr]) today and should expand 
to $200 billion (Fr1,160 billion) during the 2020's! 
  This is the enticing picture of what we can expect from 
superconductivity, if we can really manage to make it occur at 
room temperature. 
  Two CNRS research teams just came closer to this objective. 
To end 1993 with a flourish, one CNRS-associated unit at the 
Higher School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry of the City of 
Paris, and two CNRS units in Grenoble--the Research Center on 
Very Low Temperatures and the Crystallography 
Laboratory--indulged themselves with superconductivity phenomena 
in cuprates, respectively in a bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper 
oxide compound at 250 Kelvin [K] (-23xC) and in a mercury 
cuprate compound at 280 K (+7xC)... a world record. 
  Superconductivity was discovered in 1911; it is a state of 
matter (like the solid, liquid, or gaseous states) obtained by 
lowering the temperature below a so-called "critical" 
temperature, when electric resistance completely and suddenly 
disappears. In this state, matter no longer dissipates any 
energy, and the magnetic field is also expelled outside the 
volume of material; this diamagnetism phenomena was used by the 
Japanese to develop a magnetic levitation train, and it can be 
used to produce intense magnetic fields. 
  As explained by Michel Lagues, head of the Paris team and 
research director at the CNRS, "for 50 years the phenomenon was 
confined to the few tens of degrees above absolute zero 
(-273xC); but since 1986 the discovery of a new family of 
so-called `high-temperature' superconductors, the cuprates, led 
us to look forward to industrial applications." 
  It is all a matter of critical temperature; the latter 
depends on the nature and structure of the material. "The 
cuprates that led to new developments in relation with 
temperature are crystals consisting of octahedrons stacked in 
space in all directions and containing a metallic atom at their 
center and oxygen atoms at their summits; the spaces between 
octahedrons are taken up by another metallic atom," Michel 
Lagues went on. In the Grenoble experiment, the cuprates were 
obtained as massive ceramic-like materials or monocrystals; in 
the Paris experiment, they were obtained as thin films. 
<H5>  Progress Remains To Be Made </H5>
  The researchers, are very cautious about their success. 
Actually, at Grenoble, the temperature record occurred at random 
during a routine operation performed at night. In addition, 
superconductivity occurred in only one percent of a sample of 
several cubic meters; there remains to find where that one 
percent is located and to determine its structure. In the Paris 
experiment, we should indicate that the sample was an extremely 
thin film (eight atom layers, i.e. 30 millionths of one 
millimeter) weighing under one tenth of one millionth gram; all 
these characteristics test the sensitivity of available 
measuring instruments. Large-scale applications, therefore, 
should not be expected to emerge for several years. 
  Besides, increasing the critical temperature will not 
suffice 
to develop industrial superconductivity; results will also have 
to be obtained at room temperature and with high current flows 
within the material. After that, of course, competitive 
manufacturing processes will have to be found.

<F P=106> [Article signed WK/RP/ZS: "Ascom: There Is Still a Chance To </F>
Avoid The Worst. The U.S. Group AT&amp;T Would Be The Ideal 
Partner"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Zurich, 11 Feb (ATS) -- Ascom, the Bern-based 
telecommunications group is facing serious difficulties. 
However, it still has one chance to avoid the worst. If it 
fails to seize this opportunity, this will mean the end of the 
Swiss telecommunications industry. Mr. Heinrich Steinmann, 
member of both the management of the Union of Swiss Banks and 
the board of directors at Ascom, affirmed this in an interview 
published in the economic weekly "CASH". 
  If Ascom does not succeed in turning the page, it will find 
itself in the hands of major companies and will cease to exist 
as an independent group. In his capacity as committee member of 
the board of directors and as president of the Hasler 
Foundation, which owns a majority stake in Ascom, Mr. Steinmann 
feels that he is facing a major challenge. He must come up with 
a corporate strategy that everyone will understand, and which 
proves feasible. 
<H5>  New Strategy </H5>
  With the help of the McKinsey consulting company, a 
market-based strategy has been developed. This strategy is 
based on three main pillars: telecommunications, corporate 
networks, and the automation of services. Sectors were selected 
in these three areas where Ascom can obtain a market share of 
over 25 percent, stated Mr. Steinmann. All the rest will be 
liquidated or sold. 
  In the future, the group will be strictly managed according 
to the needs of its customers. The time devoted to the 
development and production of each product will have to be 
considerably reduced. 
  At present, Ascom depends on the Swedish Ericsson group for 
public telecommunications. The Bern-based company is good, but 
a fair portion of the know-how involved comes from Sweden, noted 
Mr. Steinmann. In the long term this sector will have to be 
given up to Ericsson, bit by bit. 
<H5>  Becoming World Champion </H5>
  The strength of Ascom lies in its conventional telephones, 
small exchanges, and cordless telephones. Here, both the 
quality and design are good. In addition, Ascom's telephones 
are user-friendly. 
  Ascom must become "world champion" in man's contact with the 
system. However, in order to do this, it will have to make 
considerable progress. In this respect, collaboration with the 
U.S. telecommunications giant AT&amp;T would be ideal. 
  AT&amp;T cannot sell its telephones in Europe, because they 
were 
designed specifically for and in accordance with the taste of 
U.S. consumers. However, it could take over Ascom's telephones. 
Should a group of this type open up its market, this would 
represent a tremendous opportunity for Ascom. 
<H5>  Chairmanship Not Targeted </H5>
  Mr. Steinmann specified that he was not targeting the 
chairmanship of Ascom's board of directors, led by Mr. Heinz 
Frey, which is currently under tremendous pressure. It is up to 
Mr. Frey to decide what he wants to make of his chairmanship. 
  Ascom's board of administration and the founding board of 
the 
Hasler Foundation should clearly support Mr. Frey. Should 
either of these two bodies indicate doubts regarding Mr. Frey, 
then the chairman-in-office would probably have to take the 
consequences.

<F P=106> [Article by Herbert Grab: "Growing Pains"] </F>
  [Text] The mobile communications market in Germany is 
taking off in a big way. Manufacturers cannot meet the demand 
for equipment. Network operators and service providers are 
struggling hard to keep up with the mass of subscribers in the 
D-networks. Hardware prices are plummeting. The extent of the 
continuing boom has evidently surprised all parties involved. 
  In the spring of 1992, Deutsche Telekom proudly pointed out 
that the number of subscribers to mobile services in the whole 
of Germany -- adding all services together -- amounted to one 
million: 600,000 in the analogue C-network, over 360,000 in the 
paging services Cityruf (Citycall) and Eurosignal and a few 
thousand in the first PMR regions and the old B-network. 
  At the time, about a year and a half ago, the Federal 
Republic, with its analogue C-network confined within national 
borders and barely eight mobile telephones per 1000 inhabitants, 
was an underdeveloped mobile market. 
  Today, these figures seem to date back to another era. 
Germany has climbed to the top of the world's market with its 
two digital networks, technologically as well as in terms of 
subscriber numbers. In no other mobile markets are growth rates 
as enormous as here. 
  Around 800,000 subscribes populated the D-networks at the 
end 
of October. In addition, 800,000 more Germans use mobile phones 
in the analogue C-network. With a population of 80 million, 
this amounts to 20 mobile phones per 1000 inhabitants. 
  If one adds up the totals of mobile subscribers in Germany 
including paging services, PMR, satellite and mobile data, the 
two million limit has long been passed. Within 18 months, the 
mobile market within Germany has doubled -- and thus changed 
fundamentally. 
  There are several reasons for this boom -- the extent of 
which surprises even the experts. One source of the increase in 
subscribers is the backlog created during the 1980s. The 
restricted C-network, and terminal prices which were extremely 
high compared with other countries, kept the market artificially 
small. 
  And the D-networks came into operation a year later than 
originally planned. During this year (mid-1991 to mid-1992) the 
mobile market grew much more slowly than before -- many 
subscribers were waiting for digital mobile services. 
  Plummeting prices for mobile phones are another phenomenon. 
Today, in Germany you can buy a mobile phone for about DM500 
[German marks] -- subsidised by network operators and service 
providers who are hell-bent on flogging their wares, cost 
notwithstanding. 
  First generation GSM terminals, according to the German head 
of British manufacturer Orbitel, Klaus Angermuller, "will 
practically be given away for free soon." And Kalevi Kaartinen, 
managing director of Nokia Mobile Phones Deutschland, states: 
"The Germans create English conditions, but with German 
thoroughness." Similar comments are heard from the managing 
director of service provider Unicom, Stefan Sieber: "We now have 
a situation in our market that took the English five years." 
<H5>  Problems for Service Providers </H5>
  Manufacturers are complaining about the minimal profit 
margins achieved with mobil radio telephones. Bundling is 
weakening the business foundation of dealers and service 
providers. They are selling terminals below purchase price: 
their margins have to come from premiums tied into the SIM 
cards and subsequent call volumes. 
  But this calculation has not turned out as expected. The 
cheaper mobile phones are being sold over the counter and are 
being bought by private customers. And they are using them 
significantly less frequently than professional users. 
  The result: Not only the hardware profits, but also the 
commissions from call volumes are far too low. Most service 
providers made their calculations assuming about DM200 per 
subscriber per month (including the basic charge) but, so far, 
nobody is actually realising this margin. "We are in danger of 
simply maximising our losses with increasing numbers of 
subscribers," complains the managing director of a well know 
service provider. 
  But falling prices and profit margins do not seem to deter 
newcomers. More and more firms from other industries hit by the 
recession are constantly looking for salvation on the mobile 
market. The consumer electronics sector jumps onto the mobile 
train as do office equipment and computer dealers, petrol 
stations and car dealers. And the mass marketers' golden hour 
has already arrived -- mail order companies, department stores, 
supermarkets. Mobile phones can be obtained at every corner. 
  Consumer electronics manufacturer Grundig is starting to 
market cards for the D-network through its car hi-fi dealers. 
Its partners is service provider D-plus, in which Grundig is a 
25 percent shareholder. In the near future Grundig is also 
planning to enter the market with its own mobile phones. 
  Leading computer multiples Vobis and Escom are also hopeful. 
For the past few weeks they have been offering cards and 
terminals for the D-networks. Escom is selling Motorola 
terminals and D2-cards according to Gorbachev's maxim: "If you 
are too expensive, life will punish you." Vobis is coming along 
with a wide range of equipment, featuring, amongst others, the 
brand new pocketphone from Orbitel -- and D1-cards. 
  The problem is that the more the marketing people from other 
industries want to benefit from this booming market -- and put 
their money on rapid, uncomplicated turnover of mass product 
mobile phones -- the lower the quality of consultancy and 
service. 
  D-plus managing director Hansjurgen Roesch: "The more 
consumers are lured into the networks without sufficient advice 
and service, the higher the number of potentially dissatisfied 
clients later on." The result will be high cancellation rates 
and lots of swaps from one service provider/network operator to 
the next -- increasing the cost but not the profit below the 
line. "And this," says Roesch, "cannot be in anyone's interest." 
  All 13 service providers are currently operating. But the 
industry is certain that by the end of 1994, the first few will 
have given up. It is predominantly the traditional mobile 
dealers who are about to drown. They are complaining about more 
customers, more demand for advice and consultancy services, but 
less money in the till. Lower hardware margins and their 
aggressive rivals constitute a serious challenge. 
  "Although at the moment, there are no mass casualties in the 
dealer environment," warns Harald Koester, managing director of 
service provider proficom, he is certain that this will happen. 
And for his colleague, Kai Uwe Ricke, son of Telekom's chief 
Helmut Ricke and head of service provider Talkline, the real 
price battle is yet to come. 
  The industry's view of the future is equivocal. On the one 
hand, everyone is hoping for profits from a vigorous start to 
the mass market. On the other hand, even 18 months after the 
opening of the D-networks in Germany, there is absolute chaos 
behind the scenes. And many of the problems which will become 
acute next year have not yet been solved. 
  For example, airtime billing with the network operators is 
done "manually". Online connections between the data processing 
systems of network operators and service providers will only be 
introduced from early next year. 
  "Let's hope", comments an insider, "that before then there 
will be no more European roaming agreements." Because these are 
presently dealt with bilaterally between individual roaming 
partners -- a "homespun" solution requiring massive amounts of 
staff. 
  Meanwhile, service providers are waiting for network 
operators to introduce data over GSM services. This, they hope, 
will provide a new stimulus to the market and the opportunity to 
distinguish themselves from the others. 
  Individual tariff structures are one key mechanism through 
which some service providers are already trying to establish 
themselves. But this requires considerably more processing 
capability than is provided by service providers' current 
management and billing software. Without large investments, 
nothing is possible at all. 
<H5>  E-Plus </H5>
  And, as if service providers and dealers did not have enough 
problems already, the next player to enter the market is E-plus 
-- the third big network operator. In the first few months of 
1994, the PCN operator (the network is marketed as E1 in 
Germany) will launch service in two densely populated areas of 
the new German "Lander". By the end of 1994, E-Plus chief 
Herbert Brenke is hoping to have covered the 17 most important 
economic centres in Germany. 
  The main emphasis of the E-Plus rollout lies -- as requested 
by the Federal Ministry for Post and Telecommunications, who 
awarded the licence -- in the new German Lander. They are 
supposed to have 88 percent coverage by the end of 1995 -- 
serving essentially 100 percent of the population. 
  The chaotic market already creates more than enough problems 
for Brenke. His company does not intend to distinguish itself 
from the D-network operators in terms of hardware prices. The 
PCN handsets used in E-Plus are technically little different 
from GSM terminals. Motorola, for example, will offer its new 
MicroTAC in an almost identical form to its current PCN version 
in the United Kingdom. In Germany, it will be available with 
the start of E-plus. The price, according to Motorola manager 
Georg F. Langheld, will be based on that of the GSM terminals. 
  Call tariffs will also prove an ineffective weapon in the 
battle over mobile phone customers. Until now, D1 and D2 have 
kept their airtime prices artificially high. If E-Plus offers 
lower rates, then its two GSM rivals will be able to follow suit 
without problem -- especially as upgrades of their network 
infrastructure can now be achieved much more cheaply than two to 
three years ago, thanks to the worldwide availability of GSM. 
  It is particularly difficult, according to Brenke, to set up 
a sales network. Service providers and dealers are too busy 
solving their existing problems. "What they need least of all 
now is another network operator," says a market expert. 
  Mobile dealers are not therefore particularly willing to 
busy 
themselves with E-plus at the moment. Brenke will almost 
certainly have to strengthen his own service provider -- the 
14th on the German market -- more than was planned originally. 
  The sole cause for optimism in the industry at the moment 
concerns growth rates. In the five months from March to August 
1993, the number of D-network subscribers doubled from some 
300,000 to almost 600,000. And in September the growth rate 
increased even more, to a record 106,240 new subscribers within 
a month. 
  The industry is expecting to reach one million subscribers 
in 
the D-networks by the end of this year. Monthly growth rates of 
100,000 and more new subscribers for 1994 are already almost 
taken for granted. 
<H5>  PMR and Mobile Data </H5>
  But a lot has happened in Germany within the last few 
months, 
not only within the GSM and PCN sectors. Two more mobile 
markets are beginning to become noticed in public: PMR and 
mobile data. 
  While Telekom -- or, more precisely, its mobile daughter 
DeTeMobil -- is already active in both these markets (Chekker in 
PMR, Modacom in mobile data), private competitors are moving in. 
  The new licensees for regional PMR networks in urban areas 
("A" regions) have joined up and formed two nation-wide 
competitors: RegioNet and Terrafen. With four regions only, 
Sprintel (a subsidiary of Swiss company Swissphone) is trying to 
keep up. 
  The networks for these already exist -- except for Sprintel 
-- and the fight for market share is ongoing. 
  Meanwhile, DeTeMobil has founded an association, the 
Funkfachhandels Organisation (TFK), which builds up and markets 
Chekker networks outside urban areas. The concept is to tag 
these networks onto "A" networks so they can serve as the link 
between two large conurbations. Participants are TFK, DeTeMobil 
and large local radio/mobile dealers. 
  The first few TFK Chekker networks already exist. DeTeMobil 
and the private PMR operators are competing for those GSM 
customers whose activities are mainly confined within a region. 
Roaming possibilities between individual PMR networks are 
intended to help in this process. 
  The mobile data market in Germany is not quite so advanced. 
DeTeMobil's Modacom network has been running since the beginning 
of June -- but terminals have only been available in reasonable 
quantities since October. 
  And a private mobile data licence has yet to be granted. 
Applications have been submitted since mid-October but the 
process continues until February 15. The Federal Ministry for 
Post and Telecommunications will not decide on this licence 
until 31 May 1994. 
  DeTeMobil is expecting half a million mobile data 
subscribers 
in Germany by the year 2000 in both future networks. Other 
observers estimate a market potential of about two million 
subscribers. 
  Four companies are expected to apply for a mobile data 
licence; D2 operator Mannesmann Mobilfunk and its subsidiary 
Eurocom, the electricity utilities Rheinisch-Westfalischen 
Elektrizitatswerken (RWE) and Preussen Elektra, and BellSouth in 
association with RAM Mobile Data. 
  D2 chief Peter Mihatsch already announced his interest in 
such a licence last spring. He wants high usage of his 
infrastructure -- mobile data seems ideal. 
  For BellSouth, the situation is quite similar. The United 
States company holds 21 percent in E-Plus (Table 1). If this 
consortium is granted the licence there would be obvious synergy 
effects with E1. 
  Klaus Kirchhoefer, responsible for new business developments 
and expansion at RWE: "We are currently examining our 
participation in the application process." And VEBA-subsidiary 
Preussen Elektra is considering participation "with interest", 
as they say.

<F P=106> [Article by Vera Viola: "Research, Yes to Funding From IMI </F>
for Telespazio, Ericsson and FIAR"] 
  [Text] Rome. Scientific research is concentrating on 
telecommunications. Four projects that require a global 
investment of 42 billion lire have been accepted for facilitated 
contributions from the IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Real 
and Personal Property] fund. The OK came after approval from 
University and Scientific Research Minister Umberto Colombo. 
The companies concerned are Telespazio (of the IRI-STET 
[Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry - Turin Telephone 
Finance Company] group), Ericsson Fatme, FIAR (IRI-Finmeccanica) 
and ARE [Electrical Radio Applications] (Racal Electronics). 
The goal of the Telespazio project is to develop an automation 
systems network for telecommunications equipment at a total 
budgeted cost of four billion lire. On the other hand 20 
billion is to be invested in Ericsson Fatme. In this case 
systems should be constructed for digitizing telecommunications 
networks. FIAR's applied research plan provides for an 
expenditure of 15 billion in the remote sensing sector. 
  The fourth project that has been given the go-ahead for 
facilitated funding concerns the activation of apparatus for 
subscribers and network terminals for ISDN [integrated services 
digital network] telematic services. It will be perfected, with 
an investment of 3.2 billion lire, by ARE (Electrical Radio 
Applications), a company based in Legnano and connected with the 
British group Racal Electronics. 
  Meanwhile, Italsiel of the Finsiel group will participate in 
the realization of the "Care Telematics Projects," for a 
European information system for food safety. An international 
consortium (that Italsiel is part of) will manage the project 
that will be coordinated by the World Health Organization. The 
Care telematics projects form part of the larger program called 
ENS (European Nervous System) that the EU [European Union] has 
launched for the diffusion of telematic exchanges between the 
administrations of EC countries.

<F P=106> [Article signed Severine Lascombe: "Deutsche Telekom </F>
Prepares For Privatization"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt -- After long and difficult negotiations 
the parties of the coalition have arrived at a compromise for 
the transformation of the three parts of the former German post 
office (telecoms, postal service and finance) into three limited 
companies in 1994. 
  Even if more than half the shares return to the private 
sector in the next five years, the three companies will retain 
close government ties. The postal minister will control a 
regulatory board and the German regional authorities [Laender] 
will have the right to inspect companies through a regulatory 
council. In addition, a holding company will head the three 
companies to coordinate the different advisory bodies. One of 
its roles will be to set charges, in consultation with the 
postal workers' union Deutsche Postgewerkschaft [DPG]. 
  In other respects, no one yet knows whether the stock market 
flotation will serve to strengthen the companies financially or 
if proceeds will be used to make up the German budget deficit. 
  These decisions come at a time when Deutsche Telekom and 
France Telecom have decided to strengthen existing ties -- they 
jointly own Eucom and Eunetcom -- with plans to create a joint 
structure to meet all the international requirements of both 
companies.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with General Adyr da Silva, president </F>
of Telebras, by Ethevaldo Siqueira, by telephone on 8 October 
1993: "Telebras--Year 21, According to its President"; 
introductory and concluding paragraphs in italics as published] 
  [Text] In this exclusive interview, the president of 
Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.], Air Force General 
Adyr da Silva, announces contracts for 1.8 million terminals by 
the end of 1993 and the installation of 1 million new lines in 
1993. He also presents an analysis of his firm, which will 
celebrate its 21st anniversary on 9 November. 
  "Telebras is the result of an antiprivatization movement, 
seeing that the situation in the preceding period was one of 
private concessions and hundreds of obsolete and inefficient 
municipal systems. Its work during these 21 years has been 
extraordinary in that it has expanded the Brazilian telephone 
network from about 1.5 million terminals in 1972 to more than 11 
million today. In mathematical language, that is what we call a 
positive derivative." 
  With those words, Air Force General Adyr da Silva sums up 
the 
role played by Telebras in the 21 years of existence that it is 
now completing. In his opinion, one of the holding company's 
most significant gains is the "complete technological cycle" 
that has been achieved thanks to the work of the Cpqd [Research 
and Development Center]. That work has guaranteed development of 
the main basic technologies--ranging from digital telephone 
exchanges to fiber optics. 
  Here we present the main passages from his lengthy 
interview, 
which was given by telephone at 2300 hours on Friday 8 October. 
  1.8 million terminals--"We have now contracted for over 1 
million terminals, and by December [1993] we will have added to 
that number another 720,000 terminals for large public digital 
exchanges. That will give us to a total of 1.8 million lines 
contracted for in a single year, including 200,000 cellular 
telephones. That is a historical record. But it is not a 
question simply of setting records, but of reversing the 
previous situation. The fact is that a little over 300,000 lines 
were contracted for in 1992. We have had to put more emphasis on 
signing such contracts to guarantee an annual average of close 
to 1 million during the three-year period and thus reach the 2.2 
million planned for 1995 and beyond. And to the surprise of 
those most skeptical, the cost of an integrated terminal is 
declining and may reach $2,600. There has been a sizable drop in 
the cost of switching." 
  Record installation--"By the end of December we will have 
installed 1 million new terminals. This means that Telebras will 
be making favorable progress by increasing the number of 
terminals installed from about 800,000 in 1992 to 1 million in 
1993. We hope to reach 1.4 million in 1994." 
  Fiber optics--"Brazil now has many optical fiber 
manufacturers, among them Pirelli, Bracel, ABC Xtal, Furukawa, 
and others. This proves that the market is growing. The Telebras 
system uses many thousands of kilometers of fiber-optic cable, 
including not only long-distance cables--such as Embratel's 
[Brazilian Telecommunications Company's] cable between Rio de 
Janeiro and Sao Paulo--but chiefly the urban connections that no 
one sees. I returned recently from Sao Luis, where I signed the 
Telma [Maranhao Telecommunications] cellular telephone contract. 
This means that the fiber-optic ring in Sao Luis will soon be 
completed. So optical fibers are becoming a technological 
reality and playing a part in day-to-day Brazilian 
telecommunications." 
  Card-operated public telephones--"The rate at which public 
telephones are expanding is speeding up, and we are going to 
reach a total network of over 270,000 this year. We have had to 
overcome various problems in order to consolidate the card 
technology and even the industrial cost of producing new public 
telephones. It was a struggle, but we won thanks to the Cpqd's 
work." 
  Tropico and Zetax--"When Zetax objects to the acquisition of 
720,000 Tropico terminals and accuses us of protecting the three 
Tropico manufacturers, I argue that Zetax telephone exchanges 
are still a long way from achieving the capacity of our RA. As 
far as I know, Zetax exchanges have trouble handling 2,000 
terminals. So if Zetax wants to build Tropicos, it can do so. 
Telebras will transfer all the know-how to it immediately. But 
is there a market for so many manufacturers?" 
<H5>  Six Major Goals </H5>
  Adyr da Silva reviewed the six major goals adopted under his 
management: a resumption of growth, an increased social 
contribution by the industry, PQP's (quality and productivity 
programs), a new policy for the Cpqd, international cooperation, 
and establishment of the ombudsman system. Here is an evaluation 
of those six courses of action in the words of the Telebras 
president himself: 
  Resumption of growth--"Considering the fundamental role 
played by telecommunications, which are a real springboard on 
which the country depends, our first goal is the resumption of 
sectoral growth. This is reflected in the contracts signed for 
over 1.8 million lines this year and the installation of 1 
million terminals. And as a contribution to the country, we are 
thinking much more about integrated development than simply 
about economic, technological, or social development." 
  Social contribution--"We have often been criticized for 
giving priority to this goal on the grounds that we are simply 
subsidizing the cost of telephone tokens and basic residential 
service. That is not true. We are going far beyond those two 
areas with projects such as these: 
  "Virtual telephony, by means of which people and 
professionals with low incomes can have a terminal or `mailbox' 
enabling them to receive messages and giving them access to the 
telecommunications system at much lower cost. 
  "Community centers, such as the one inaugurated recently in 
Toledo, Parana, which provide the public with access at a single 
location to telephones, domestic and international direct 
dialing, faxes, microcomputers, and so on. It is `the poor man's 
teleport,' to use the picturesque nickname it has been given. 
  "The encouragement of fund drives such as Child-Hope, which 
may collect something in the neighborhood of $2 million this 
year alone for helping needy Brazilian children through UNICEF. 
Our support is not limited solely to the Globo Network's drive, 
as one might think; it is available to any other broadcaster 
that wants to launch similar drives. We also have the Campaign 
in Support of the Physically Handicapped, which is co-sponsored 
by the government of the Federal District, and Betinho's 
Campaign Against Hunger, by means of which the Telebras system 
encourages its companies to accept contributions in 
nonperishable foodstuffs and products and send them to 
accredited agencies. 
  "Low-cost rural telephone service is a program that we 
intend 
to launch before the end of the year. 
  "Incidentally, the issue of rural telephone service has been 
a challenge for Brazil. When people criticize the state monopoly 
on the grounds that only 2 percent of Brazilian rural properties 
have telephone service, I don't know whether that is little or a 
lot, considering that according to the IBGE [Brazilian Institute 
of Geography and Statistics], there are over 7 million parcels 
of rural property in our country. At any rate, considering the 
extremely low purchasing power of farmers and the high cost of 
rural telephone service, how can this problem be solved? In my 
opinion, the best prospects will have to come from the new 
technologies." 
  Quality and productivity--"We are establishing total quality 
and productivity programs in many firms belonging to the 
Telebras system, among them Telebahia [Bahia 
Telecommunications], Telepar [Parana Telecommunications], 
Teleceara [Ceara Telecommunications], Telpa, Telerj [Rio de 
Janeiro Telecommunications], and, obviously, Telebras itself. 
For that purpose, we have international agreements allowing us 
to send professionals to Japan and other countries for training. 
The UFMG [Federal University of Minas Gerais], for example, has 
been playing a prominent role in this area of total quality and 
productivity." 
  Policy for Cpqd--"The Cpqd cannot disperse its funds among 
dozens of projects. A better plan is to concentrate its efforts 
on a few development projects that are real priorities. In line 
with that thinking, the center is putting more emphasis on the 
following projects: 
  "1. Adding new features to the Tropico telephone exchange. 
  "2. Refining and innovating resources in connection with 
card-operated telephones. 
  "3. Exploring all the possibilities of virtual telephony 
based on voice mail technology. 
  "4. Mastering the technology of intelligent networks. 
  "5. Investing as much as possible in network management, one 
of the most important areas for the country in the future. 
  "6. Exploring all developments in the field of personal 
communications services in accordance with the PCS (Personal 
Communications Services or Personal Communications Network) 
concept." 
  International cooperation--"Telebras has been benefiting 
from 
international cooperation programs, among which I would like to 
emphasize the following: 
  "1. The Cpqd has technological cooperation contracts with 
the 
following international firms: Northern Telecom, the NTT, 
AT&amp;T, 
Alcatel, Siemens, Ericsson, Millicom, and others. 
  "2. The National Training Center, which the ITU 
[International Telecommunication Union] considers a worldwide 
model and example, has been used intensively for programs to 
train professionals from all over Latin America and from 
Portuguese-speaking African countries. 
  "3. Telebras is preparing to provide international 
consulting 
and support services. This will be the case in Hungary, where we 
have been awarded the contract in international bidding." 
  Ombudsman--"Ten firms in the Telebras system--among them 
Telerj, Telebahia, and Telepar--now have an ombudsman system for 
protecting the interests of the users. The ombudsman is always 
an employee, has complete support and autonomy, and cannot be 
fired while in that job. But the rules as adopted do not allow 
him to investigate accusations that crimes have been committed. 
In those cases, the Federal Government's ombudsman steps in." 
<H5>  Triumphalist Tone </H5>
  In his interview, Gen. Adyr da Silva selects the best 
figures 
in the firm's history and pays tribute to the "people who have 
devoted and do devote the best of their creativity and 
competence to the development of this sector," the "work of 
industrial partners who, with initiative and technology, have 
believed and do believe in this sector," and, lastly, all those 
who "have contributed all along the way... some of them 
anonymous heroes." 
  The figures that fill the draft of his speech for the firm's 
21st anniversary also show that from January through August 
1993, investments in telecommunications totaled $1.975 billion, 
or 61.7 percent of the total planned for the year. Next comes 
the number of terminals installed during the same period: 
495,431, 140,000 of which are cellular mobile telephones. The 
number of terminals placed "in service" during the first eight 
months of the year was slightly higher at 507,000. 
  Besides those successes, the president of Telebras draws 
attention to the long-distance fiber-optic cable program and the 
public telephone program as milestones of his management.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Silicon Carbide Developed for </F>
Personal Body Armour"] 
  [Text] Ceramic plates for use in personal body armour have 
been developed by T&amp;N Technology, based in Manchester, United 
Kingdom, in conjunction with TBA Industrial Products. The 
silicon carbide-based ceramic offers protection comparable to 
steel plate but is 50 percent lighter, the companies say. 
  The ceramic was developed in response to the need for a 
material that could provide effective but lightweight protection 
against high velocity armour-piercing bullets without hindering 
mobility. TBA Industrial Products, a member of T&amp;N's 
Industrial 
Products and Materials group, develops body armour and armour 
systems for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, and the 
police and security organizations. The company approached T&amp;N 
Technology, the research and development arm of T&amp;N plc, for 
help in developing a material that gave the protection of 
armoured steel plate but not the weight. In response, T&amp;N 
Technology set up a product development and testing programme to 
examine the potential of silicon carbide in this application. 
  The Silicon carbide developed can withstand the impact of 
three 7.6 millimeter rounds travelling at 850 meter per second 
in the minus 1 power within a 100 square millimeter area. The 
ceramic offers a similar level of protection to steel plate but 
is 50 percent lighter. It is also 20 percent lighter than 
conventionally alumina, and substantially cheaper than boron 
carbide armour. 
  In addition to personal body armour, TBA industrial Products 
expects a strong demand for silicon carbide armour in armoured 
vehicles, security vehicles and security doors.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Manufacturing And Processing - </F>
Metal Spraying Process May Offer Cheaper Moulding Tools"] 
  [Text] Moulding tools may soon be produced more cheaply 
and quickly if a process currently being researched, Manufacture 
Using Spray Peening Technology (MUST), is successfully developed. 
  The MUST project is Brite-Euram funded and involves 
researchers from Sprayforming Developments Ltd of Swansea, 
United Kingdom; University, United Kingdom; Grundfos 
International A/S and Magma GmbH, Germany. The aim is to 
develop a process capable of producing cheaper forming tools, 
dies and moulds for the wide range of manufacturing industries 
that use this equipment. Among the applications being developed 
in the pilot programme are tools for plastic injection moulding. 
  The basis of the technology is spray forming, a process in 
which atomized molten metal particles impact with a substrate to 
form a coherent deposit. The process is similar to powder 
metallurgy (PM), but unlike PM the metal particles are not 
allowed to solidify during flight. 
  Simultaneously with the spray deposition, peening shot is 
projected through the spray cone so that it impinges on the 
substrate at the point at which the deposit is being laid down. 
The principle is that the molten spray particles are allowed to 
splat on the surface of the substrate or mould to build up a 
substantial deposit. On arrival, the splatted particles cool 
rapidly spending only a few milliseconds in the liquid state 
before cooling to the hot working temperature range. During 
spray deposition, hard peening shot moving at high velocity is 
propelled towards the depositing surface causing plastic 
deformation of the top layer of the surface and finally 
collecting at the bottom of the spray chamber. 
  The programme is investigating two potential routes for 
MUST. 
The direct route is potentially more cost effective, but may be 
limited by the restricted number of former materials that can be 
used and the poor replication of very smooth surface finishes. 
In order to replicate smooth surfaces a hybrid route, that uses 
electroforming to form the working surface of the tool, is also 
being developed. 
  A paper on the MUST process, "Spray forming: Metal Sprayed 
Steel Tooling for Tools, Dies and Moulds", is being presented at 
"Composites Tooling III" to be held 24-25 February, 1994 in 
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Novel Route Produces Polyethylene- </F>
Polyethylene Composites"] 
  [Text] A novel route to forming composites based on 
polyethylene fibres in a polyethylene matrix is being perfected 
by the Interdisciplinary Research Centre (IRC) in Polymer 
Science at Leeds University in the United Kingdom. 
  Polyethylene-Polyethylene composites are an attractive idea 
as both matrix and fibre are extremely light, the bonding 
between fibre and matrix is likely to be very good and 
polyethylene fibres offer excellent stiffness and strength 
properties. The resulting composites would have high absolute 
properties and exceptional specific properties. 
  The drawback in the past has been that orientated 
polyethylene fibres tend to lose their properties at 
temperatures in excess of 120 degrees Celsius, making any melt 
processing of the matrix impossible. 
  The IRC's approach is to use a hot compaction process where 
fibres of high modulus polyethylene are pressed together at 
elevated temperatures. Critically, however, only a small 
proportion of the fibres are melted -- enough to bind together 
the remaining fibrous material. The requirement is that nine 
percent of the fibre is melted, with this material binding the 
composite together as it cools. Sufficient pressure is 
introduced to stop shrinkage and to retain fibre orientation, 
but not to inhibit melting. 
  The resulting composites are claimed to offer strengths at 
the level that might be expected from conventional composites 
with an equivalent starting quantity of polyethylene fibres, but 
with reduced stiffness. The exact mix of stiffness and 
strength, however, is variable according to the exact processing 
conditions selected. 
  The process also works with other fibre types including 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene and liquid 
crystal polymer. 
  The IRC is now examining the material for applications in 
the 
biomedical field such as dental plates and bone replacement 
material.

<F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "ONERA Studying Behavior of </F>
Composites"] 
  [Text] Drawing on its many years of experience in the 
study of the process of deterioration of metallic materials, the 
National Office of Aeronautical Research [ONERA] is now studying 
more complex materials. 
  Composites? Everyone talks about them, everyone uses them. 
But what is actually known about their behavior, about their 
process of deterioration? Not much! Yet, in order to determine 
the useful life of a part and define intervals between 
maintenance, this knowledge is indispensable. 
  By comparison, metallic materials no longer conceal any 
secrets. For many years ONERA has worked on a realistic 
description of the (nonlinear) behavior of these materials. A 
little more recently, it was able to extend its field of 
activity to include the gamut of organic-matrix composite 
materials. 
  Building on its experience in that area, which included the 
developing of methods that have now the test of wide usage, 
ONERA is turning its attention today to thermostructural 
ceramic-matrix composites (SiC-SiC), and tomorrow to C-C and 
Ti-SiC composites... 
  Why is it so difficult to define realistically the behavior 
of composite materials? Complexity is the key word. A composite 
material presents itself as a stack of layers, each of which is 
made up of unidirectional fibers embedded in a resin. Its 
complexity, or rather diversity, gives rise to a process of 
deterioration having multiple origins: fissures of different 
types and delamination. Unlike metallic materials, whose 
descriptive laws of the destruction of the piece are posited on 
a macroscopic scale, the microscopic aspect of those concerning 
composite materials cannot be circumvented. 
  The studies being conducted by ONERA are of particular 
interest to the engine manufacturers (hence, close collaboration 
with Turbomeca, SNECMA, SEP, Rolls-Royce, Fiat, etc...), but 
also to the aircraft manufacturers, in whose case the fields of 
application can be grouped under two main headings. The first is 
aeronautical and space engines, particularly insofar as concerns 
characterization of the phenomena that occur in pieces where the 
temperature gradient is high and where the stresses are of 
thermal origin; and the second is aircraft frames, stabilizers, 
and wings, from the standpoing of their problem of a vibratory 
nature, stemming more naturally from fatigue brought on by an 
extensive number of cycles. 
  In the case of engines, stresses are linked to the run/stop 
cycles and to the takeoff/cruising/landing cycles (at 
frequencies ranging from several minutes to several hours), but 
also to the high-frequency aerodynamic abrasion on the turbine 
vanes (1,000 to 10,000 Hz). 
  In that of air frames, stabilizers, and wings, the 
cyclicities are more complex and include a minimum of three 
levels of frequencies corresponding respectively to flight, 
maneuvers, and turbulences. 
  Analysis in Four Stages. 
  The study of a particular material in a particular piece is 
made in four stages of successively concatenated computations. 
First, the material's behavioral laws are modeled with the aid 
of cyclic, uniaxial, and multiaxial stress test analyses. The 
piece itself is then calculated by a finite-element method, so 
as to determine its constraints and its local deformations 
(mechanical, thermal, etc...). This is a digital stage that 
utilizes the priorly determined laws, and codes that take into 
account the cyclic phenomena. Currently, pieces are calculated 
on the basis of a service life of 500 successive cycles. ONERA's 
long-term objective is to be able to base computations on all 
the cycles of the piece, until its rupture. The third stage 
determines the critical fault (onset of fissure) and computes 
the number of cycles prior to the advent of this fault. And in 
the final stage, the propagation of the fissure (fissuration) is 
studied. 
  Depending on whether the piece is a component of the engine 
or of the structure, the approach is inelastic or elastic, 
respectively. 
  The work done thus far on metallic materials has enabled, 
among other things, the development of vanes cast under an 
anisotropic oriented monocrystalline phase. This technique 
eliminates the packing of grains, hence pits that can oxidize 
and give rise to fissures.

  [Text] The COPIT (Parliamentary Committee for 
Technological Innovation) has prepared a report on Italian space 
activity, in the year in which the ASI [Italian Space Agency] 
commission sanctioned the crisis of the space agency, from the 
end of the national programs that should have had successors to 
the reshuffling of all of the cards in the major international 
programs, from the long-term ESA [European Space Agency] plan to 
the space station promoted by the United States for which there 
are now also plans for Russian collaboration. The COPIT has 
already made interesting contributions to providing information 
on national space activities, such as the two conferences that 
were organized in January and April this year. It was precisely 
the crisis of the ASI, culminating with the formation of the 
commission in August, that led the COPIT to start a general 
deliberation on Italian space policy, and for this reason it set 
up an ad hoc study group, made up of Francesco Mazzucca 
(coordinator), Aldo D'Alessio, Michele Nones, and Walter 
Pecorella. After a special meeting that brought together the 
opinions of authoritative exponents of the scientific community 
and the industrial world connected to space, this group 
collaborated with other experts and consultants to work out the 
proposal that is presented in the document: "The Relaunching of 
Space Activity in Italy". 
  The document starts with a brief description of the origins 
of Italian space activities and the criteria on which the ASI 
was founded, underlining the critical institutional and 
functional aspects that favored, or determined, the crisis. In 
consideration of this, it points out that "a change that will 
permit the formulation of a new approach is needed" so that the 
agency can transform itself "into an efficient management body" 
that is able to face the changed conditions both of the 
international scene and of national finances. A complete 
section of the document, the final section, has been dedicated 
to the organizational structure that the ASI should take on. 
This is preceded by a section that examines the institutional 
set-up. This section is divided into two chapters, one of which 
is dedicated to the relationships between the ASI and the 
ministry (MURST (Ministry of Universities and Scientific and 
Technological Research)] watching over the ASI and the other to 
the organs of the ASI. 
  A complete section of the document (seven chapters) has been 
dedicated to the national space plan. When, in the near future, 
the period of management by the commission comes to an end, the 
summit of the ASI should be nominated, and its first act should 
be the preparation of a new national space plan that will be the 
supporting axle for the relaunching of Italian space activities. 
  The fundamental criteria that the COPIT document suggests 
for 
its formulation include coordination with the public consumers 
of space services (a long list of whom are presented), seeking 
in particular "a profound harmonization with the lines along 
which defense is developing," and the definition, in agreement 
with the ministries of finance and the budget, of a suitable 
funding policy, specifying the level of resources that is 
actually available and "the most suitable policy of 
interventions to provide for the characteristics of space 
activities." 
<H5>  For the New National Space Plan </H5>
  The weight that this sector of industry has also developed 
in 
Italy means that a space policy can no longer simply be 
considered to be a research policy, but that it must also be 
considered to be an industrial policy. This having been said, 
one of the primary roles of the agency must be to give the 
national industry the necessary competitiveness on foreign 
markets "effecting a close analysis of the costs (industrial 
audit), and facilitating and directing the companies toward the 
natural economies of scale and dimension that are critical to be 
able to play a role not only on protected and captive markets." 
It is suggested that the ASI should participate in industrial 
activities during the risk stage (also through its own presence 
as a minority in ad hoc consortiums) to help the industrial 
projects that they have singled out as potentially more 
promising as far as commercialization and industrial spin-offs 
are concerned, to take off, and then to sell them back when they 
have become consolidated. 
  As far as basic research is concerned, whilst the ASI must 
develop its own program in coordination with the activities of 
other aerospace research bodies, the main effort would be turned 
toward the development of some authentic centers of excellence. 
This, in the medium term could lead to the creation of two 
centers: one centered around the Turin-Milan area and the 
other, into which the CIRA [Italian Aerospace Research Center] 
would be integrated, centered in the Rome-Naples area. 
  "It is no longer possible to have the concept of funding 
showering down on projects. Instead it is necessary to 
concentrate on activities that are aimed at, and are an organic 
part of, the creation of centers of excellence, formative 
university processes, or the industrial policy of the ASI." 
Preference should be given to research in collaboration with 
foreign partners on projects that are funded by several 
international bodies, and the programs should be centered on 
loads that can be launched using small carriers, to take account 
both "of the limited economic undertakings that are sustainable 
and the necessity of obtaining concrete results quickly" and "of 
the development of a small national launcher." 
  With respect to this, the document affirms that "the 
necessity to autonomously put one's own satellites into orbit 
with acceptable costs is obviously the element on which any 
space policy hinges" and that in this sector Italy must 
"construct its own strategy by taking the experiences of its own 
role in European space activities into account." 
  The brief analysis of the situation and the initiatives that 
are under way concludes by upholding that the auspicious 
national launcher, that has been improved with respect to the 
Scout, should be developed using technologies that have already 
been tested in flight, a careful look being given to recurrent 
costs, and that as far as the launching stage is concerned "a 
range should be chosen that offers stable political conditions, 
and that has possibly already been used for commercial launches, 
and that is reasonably accessible not only for the operators but 
also for the consumers." 
  As far as the major launching systems are concerned, it is 
suggested that Italy's current participation in the European 
carrier, Ariane 5, should be confirmed for the successive stage, 
for the development stage, and also for its future evolution. 
  As far as the sectors involved in space activities are 
concerned, telecommunications is still the most important market 
according to the COPIT document, that dedicates a chapter to it 
alone in the part dedicated to a detailed analysis of the 
spin-offs of space activities. The part of the document that is 
dedicated to the national space plan examines its different 
aspects, taking account of the recent technological evolution 
and the new services and, in Europe, the situation regarding 
norms (deregulation within the EEC), the organization of 
industry (European industry is converging to form large 
consortiums), and the inadequate resources for research (unequal 
competition with respect to the capacities of American and 
Japanese industry). Meanwhile the sector dealing with Earth 
observation is taking on an ever greater importance, thanks also 
to the programming priority given to it by the ESA; also in 
Italy there is "a considerable demand for remote sensing from 
the public administration" and this, amongst other things, 
enhances the prospective success of small satellites that will 
exploit the capacity of the future national launcher. This 
provides the opportunity to integrate these different 
requirements in a national R&amp;D program for remote sensing 
from 
space "that allows for better qualification of the Italian 
effort in space monitoring, concretizing the effort by producing 
an application that has a high value for the future of the 
environment and for safety; calibrating on one hand the 
financial obligation and on the other enhancing existing San 
Marco Scout activities to a maximum; enhancing and making the 
best use of the resources of numerous aerospace industries in 
such a difficult economic moment." 
  The most controversial field in Europe at the moment is that 
of man in space and space transport. It is also the most 
susceptible to surprises as far as international collaboration 
is concerned at a planetary level. Some key programs for Italy 
have come under discussion again, whether this is public 
knowledge or not. The COPIT document has taken this fluid 
situation into account, suggesting that, as a serious 
alternative to Columbus, if this should be at risk, Italy could 
think of carrying out studies for the so-called exploration 
program (including the permanent station on the moon and a 
mission toward Mars) that should consolidate in concrete 
obligations for development in the years after 2000. 
<H5>  The Spin-offs of Space Activities </H5>
  The part that is dedicated to this subject starts with an 
analysis of the aspects that are relevant to technological 
innovation within the European Community according to the three 
foreseeable "scenarios" of evolution. A first return of the 
policies of consolidation and the development of space 
activities in Italy is considered in connection with the role 
that they can play in basic and applied research and in 
training, with reference to these scenarios. The main goals of 
EC policy for the technologically advanced sectors, including 
the various types of services via satellite, are then 
summarized. As far as the instruments that EC directives leave 
to the national authorities for the safeguarding and development 
of the sectors that they consider "sensitive" and/or strategic 
are concerned, according to the COPIT document: "Research 
activities and services to industry should replace direct help 
and incentives. In particular it is necessary to favor forms of 
coordination between companies and organizations that are 
working in the area of technological research and innovation to 
encourage possible synergies between public and private bodies." 
The document observes that the importance of the high 
technology sectors to the economic and social development of the 
country was recognized considerably later than it was by the 
main partners both within and outside the Community, and that 
delays have also characterized the levels of diffusion and the 
functional standards at an infrastructural level, and the 
institutional, normative and organizational aspects. 
  A chapter is dedicated to the role of space activities in 
the 
national economy, in which, amongst other things, it is revealed 
that in Italy levels of spending of around 1 trillion lire a 
year are compatible with our participation in the European space 
programs. "If the ASI is transformed into an efficient 
management body, which is also able to coordinate the efforts of 
the numerous aerospace companies, with activities and funding 
aimed at the realization of programs in well-defined fields such 
as telecommunications and Earth observation, it could help bring 
us closer to the general goal of restructuring public spending 
so that the efficiency and effectiveness of resources can 
counterbalance the mean constraints within which it can be 
foreseen that fiscalization will move in the coming years." 
Therefore, "whilst an additional funding effort is desirable, 
reorganization of the ASI programs is necessary anyway, in order 
to obtain an appreciable return on the contributions to the ESA, 
forcing a commercial type of fall-out" whilst "the convergence 
of civilian and military interest on remote sensing technologies 
imposes greater reflection on the subject of the requalification 
of military expenditure, given also the changes of goals 
following the breakdown of the East Bloc." 
  Finally, the document analyses the size of the market for 
activities that only concern space for the European aerospace 
industry, and provides interesting tables that show its 
development over the last seven years making comparisons between 
the various nations, as well as providing the possibility for 
comparisons to be made on a world scale for commercial sectors 
(satellites and antennae for users on the ground) and showing 
the relative trends of evolution.

<F P=106> [Article by Claudio Borgonovi: "The Only Thing Going Into </F>
Orbit Is The Controversy"] 
  [Text] Rome. There is now open warfare between the 
management of the national space agency, the scientists, and the 
Minister of Research who are involved in choosing a national 
space policy. Extremely heated accusations are being exchanged 
concerning the correctness of behavior in the past, the validity 
of the programs, the accounts that do not balance, and the 
methods of control that go back at least to 1988 when the ASI 
(Italian Space Agency) was set up. The confused atmosphere that 
already existed has become incandescent since the Corte dei 
Conti [Italian audit department] formally raised numerous points 
with the ASI. The Corte dei Conti has requested clarification 
of about 20 controversial points, that translated into figures 
have a total value of over 600 billion lire. 
  At present the ASI is under the control of a commission and 
will continue to be until 28 February. The commission was set 
up to manage the transitional phase leading up to the 
appointment of a new board of directors. In reality it seems 
that the goal of the commission is simply to restart all the 
activities of the ASI that have been subjected to criticisms 
from the penal and administrative judiciary regarding funding 
for research, the dismissal of Remo Ruffini (former president of 
the scientific committee and one of the most regular critics of 
the ASI's CDA), the San Marco program of Rome university, and 
the SAX [X-Ray Astronomy Satellite] satellite. Resorting to 
three commissions, made up of private citizens who are not 
members of state bodies, has not resolved these problems yet. 
The real problems are the guidelines for national participation 
in the European Space Agency (ESA) and the goals of national 
space activity. These still have to be either analyzed or 
discussed by parliament, especially now that the adjustment of 
new scenarios has become necessary following the cancellation of 
the Hermes space plane and the redimensioning of permanent 
orbital activities. 
  There is annual funding of 800 billion lire, and the 
obligations to the ESA are somewhere between 560 and 700 billion 
a year, to which internal costs of about 70 billion must be 
added, together with consistent obligations for expenditure that 
have been underwritten for the coming years without either the 
necessary authorizations of the CIPE [Interministerial Committee 
for Economic Planning] or financial cover. The European 
situation, in the light of the increased cuts called for by 
Germany and Italy, and the ratification of Maastricht, is 
weakening Italian industry, which is already being penalized by 
the depreciation of the lira, and has reduced the industrial 
returns that come from our participation in the ESA by about one 
third, and analogously increased the management costs charged to 
us. The fluctuations in exchange rates have intervened on a 
strategy that favored long-term programs and the many unknown 
factors. 
  The Tethered and Italsat programs were the subjects of 
controversies regarding their real effectiveness in the past, 
and today the SAX program is under discussion. SAX is a project 
for a light launcher and logistic space station modules. It has 
cost 644 billion lire over 14 years. Research Minister Colombo 
spoke on this subject at the end of December. He confirmed the 
regularity of the project (limiting this to the scientific and 
industrial aspects). As far as the national launcher is 
concerned, the conclusions of the relative committees are not 
yet known (but the delays and some forecasts have already 
sparked off discussions and clarifications). In any case, whilst 
the 90 billion assigned to Rome university have been blocked for 
three years, and the 440 billion requested by FIAT for the VEGA 
[Advanced Generation European Carrier] carrier have not yet been 
authorized, work is continuing on the construction of the two 
logistic modules for the United States space station: 500 
billion for the construction and a successive payment for 
maintenance and operational activities, without significant 
technological, scientific or commercial returns. In the 
meantime, yesterday, Research Minister Umberto Colombo presented 
the report on the government lines of action for innovation and 
research policy. This analysis points once again to the 
necessity of favoring innovation in the productive sectors that 
are leading our economy, promoting advanced technologies that 
have a strong capability of dissemination, reinforcing research 
and technological development activities connected with the 
modernization of the infrastructure networks (information 
science, telecommunications, transport), and favoring the 
setting up of industries that have a scientific basis. 
  Despite the situation of economic crisis, some decisions 
taken by the current government have allowed about 3.3 trillion 
lire to be recuperated, and 588 billion have been allocated to 
national research plans, 300 billion to technological parks in 
the Mezzogiorno [southern Italy], 350 billion to training, 540 
billion to projects coming under Law No. 46, and 600 billion to 
the Italian aerospace research center, that has recently been 
reoriented toward aeronautical themes. Colombo declared that 
these resources, that total 15 percent of the annual funding for 
research "are improvements obtained by eliminating areas of 
inefficiency and management errors, but it will soon be 
necessary to increase the resources available because the gap 
dividing us from the other industrialized countries has become 
intolerably wide." The immediate necessities are for the 
universities to pay greater attention to research programs that 
have fixed goals, for more effective coordination between 
programs and public research organizations, and for an increase 
in resources for training young researchers but "before asking 
for more money it is necessary to spend what is already 
available well," concluded Colombo.

<F P=106> [Letter from the Minister for Universities and Scientific </F>
and Technological Research, Umberto Colombo, to IL SOLE-24 ORE: 
"But His Criticisms Are Without Foundation"] 
  [Text] I would never have believed that in the debate on 
Italian space policy it would have been possible to stoop to 
such a low and insolent level as Remo Ruffini has done in his 
article. 
  He sustains that I, in this ministry that "keeps watch over" 
the Italian Space Agency (ASI), should have held a more balanced 
position on the SAX [X-Ray Astronomy Satellite] project, that 
was more in keeping with my important responsibility. Saying 
this, he ignores the fact that the minister is not only 
vigilant, but also exercises guiding functions for scientific 
and technological programs and for programs applied to these 
subjects, and gives directives as far as the participation of 
the ASI in national and international programs is concerned. It 
was therefore my duty to examine the main aspects of the SAX 
program, which is the subject of a specific agreement between 
the ASI and the Dutch space agency. 
  I have tried to clarify two key points: 
  1. Is it true that the cost of the SAX project has continued 
to increase, generating continual waste, and that it is out of 
control? 
  2. Is the project valid from a scientific point of view? 
  There is ample official documentation regarding the first 
point, from which it results that the total cost for the project 
foreseen today is the same as that calculated in 1988 (this was 
the time when the ASI was set up), and indicated in the national 
space plan for 1990-94 that was approved by the CIPE 
[Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning] in July 1991. 
All increases in the cost of the program took place before 1988 
and Ruffini knows well that the most important component of this 
increase in cost was the change in the program that took place 
following the accident of the United States Challenger in 1987, 
that brought about the decision of NASA to refuse the 
availability of the Shuttle for the SAX mission. Therefore to 
speak of irregularities and unlawful administrative acts 
totaling 641 billion lire is misleading, and does not in fact 
correspond with the communications sent to the ASI by the 
Italian audit department. 
  On the second point, I would like first of all to recall 
that 
Ruffini himself (who at the time was president of the scientific 
committee of the ASI), in his official report to the board of 
directors, presented on 13 and 26 November 1991, stated: "The 
national scientific project in which the agency is placing the 
greatest technological and economic commitment is without doubt 
that of the SAX satellite, called for by the scientific 
community and needed by the national space plan to allow 
national industry to become qualified at the level of prime 
contractor for a scientific satellite." So, a little more than 
two years ago, when the current cost had been known for some 
time and had been stressed, Ruffini was a convinced supporter of 
the validity of the SAX program. Evidently he has changed his 
mind since then. This would be completely legitimate, if his 
current opinion were accompanied by an indication of the new 
facts, on a scientific level, that in these two years have made 
the validity of the SAX project fade. 
  I myself, before being nominated minister, was on a 
commission that was coordinated by the president of the National 
Academy of the Lincei, Giorgio Salvini, and that comprised 
including myself, the president of the Papal Academy of 
Sciences, Nicola Cabibbo, European Space Agency Council 
President Francesco Carassa, and State Advisor Filippo Patroni 
Griffi. In reply to a precise question put to us by the 
minister, we concluded that the SAX project should be largely 
attributed -- precisely because of the goals that it had been 
given -- to the program for basic research. In the same report 
we expressed deep concern about the time of execution, 
indicating, on the basis of the information available to us, 
that a delay beyond December 1994 would have been damaging to 
the program. 
  In July 1993, soon after I had taken over the responsibility 
for the ministry, I learnt that the date for the launching of 
SAX had been moved to December 1995. I therefore had to 
ascertain whether this further delay would have reduced the 
scientific value of the project to such a level that it was 
advisable to end it, even if the expenditure that had already 
been sustained, and the expenditure that was contractually 
pledged irreversibly had in any case made it necessary to spend 
between 75 and 80 percent of the 614 billion lire that made up 
the total cost of the undertaking. 
  I was informed, during a meeting that I had with the 
International Scientific Committee on the SAX project, that 
other ESA and NASA missions for X-ray astronomy had been 
subjected to a parallel delay and that therefore the space of 
time for the full scientific validity of the project had been 
put forward. A panel, nominated at my request, by the president 
of the European Space Science Committee of the European Space 
Science Foundation, Heinrich Volk of the Max Planck Institute in 
Heidelberg, came to an analogous result. This panel comprised 
Professor J. Bleeker of Utrecht, a scientist responsible for SAX 
in the Netherlands, Professor T. Courvoisier of Geneva, 
Professor J.L. Culhane of London and Professor H.W. Schnopper of 
Lyngby, Sweden. 
  The panel formulated the following recommendation: "Having 
considered the composition of the scientific component of the 
SAX program and the work that is planned for this mission, and 
having compared these with those of the missions that are 
currently operative and planned for the near future, we 
recommend that this program goes ahead dynamically to ensure a 
launch in 1995." 
  Ruffini thinks that entrusting commissions that are 
nominated 
ad hoc to give advisory opinions about the individual problems 
is an attempt to force preconstituted solutions. This 
presupposes the intellectual dishonesty of who nominates the 
commissions and who accepts to be part of them, and I would like 
to know what leads him to believe that people that are esteemed 
by everybody for their moral integrity should behave in a way 
that is less than correct. 
  In particular Ruffini builds up a hypothesis of trickery 
based on the fact that I, being at that time the president of 
the European Science Foundation (the most important organization 
with head office in Strasbourg that coordinates programs and 
networks of basic research in Europe and that is systematically 
consulted by the European Union Commission and by the European 
Space Agency), have in some way influenced the opinion of its 
space committee. By thinking this, he ignores the fact that 
whoever behaved in such a way would immediately be disqualified 
by the international scientific community. 
  The discourteous behavior of Ruffini penetrates to the point 
of trying to intimidate gentlemen like Giampietro Puppi, one of 
the most eminent Italian physicists, who is effecting with 
competence and absolute dedication the difficult role of 
commissioner of the ASI, and dealing with Sergio Ristuccia, 
former judiciary and secretary general of the Italian audit 
department, in vulgar terms. The seditious accusations of 
Ruffini tend to give credit to, and to amplify, the hypotheses 
of irregularity and unlawful acts for which proceedings are in 
course, opened by the regional attorney of the Italian audit 
department, and I hope, that in the interest of the national 
space program, these can rapidly be brought to a conclusion, 
thereby bringing a situation of uncertainty, that leaves space 
for slanderers to do their far from noble work, to an end.

<F P=106> [Article by Riccardo Romani: "CISE of Milan Uses Gallium </F>
Arsenide Solar Cells"] 
  [Text] Another important step forward in the photovoltaic 
conversion of solar energy has been made with gallium arsenide 
(GaAs) cell technology. For over 10 years this has been used in 
addition to silicon in the constant search for new and more 
efficient solutions to the production of electricity using solar 
energy. This step has been made by the new generation germanium 
substrate GaAs cells developed by researchers at CISE [Center 
for Data, Studies, and Experimentation] in Milan (an ENEL 
[National Electric Power Company] research company] and 
successfully tested for 11 months on the EURECA [European 
Retrievable Carrier] platform in space from which they have now 
returned for further laboratory tests. The results furnished by 
these cells as well as definitively confirming their higher 
performance with respect to silicon cells, now open interesting 
prospects for further development since their costs are now the 
same as those of their competitors, silicon cells. 
  As has been noted, the development of the two technologies 
has always been accompanied by advantages and disadvantages: 
reduced costs but low conversion factors (10-14 percent) in the 
case of silicon solar cells; in the case of gallium arsenide 
cells however, the performance is doubled but with costs up to 
four times higher. These differences have obviously induced 
researchers all over the world to concentrate their efforts on 
silicon cells because of their possible ground applications for 
photovoltaic energy (panels for domestic use, experimental 
centers etc.), but placing great emphasis on gallium arsenide 
cells because of their higher performance levels, the increased 
resistance of GaAs to cosmic radiation, and high performance at 
low temperatures. 
  That is, to make them more suitable for military and space 
applications. Here, increased performance, reliability, the 
reduced size and weight of the panels at equivalent power levels 
and consequently an increased scientific payload, not the costs, 
are the determining factors when choosing the optimal solution. 
  Now that the cost difference between GaAs and silicon cells 
has been overcome, the new generation GaAs cells tested aboard 
EURECA have become more appealing because performance levels are 
doubled and because of the other advantages already mentioned 
(size, weight, reliability, etc.). A success that CISE 
researchers have achieved by replacing the substrate, which was 
previously made of the same material, with a thinner but 
stronger and much less expensive germanium substrate; and using 
a new deposition technology for the fine superficial GaAs layer 
on the new substrate. That is, passing from the previous 
"liquid phase" deposition technique to the "vapor phase" 
technique. The process is based on the natural phenomenon of 
epitaxy (under which crystals of different kinds become 
associated according to well-determined laws), normally used in 
microelectronics to produce crystals in semiconducting 
materials. This has now been developed by CISE after an initial 
collaboration with Bell Laboratories and almost 10 years of 
testing, by depositing GaAs on various substrates (germanium, 
silicon) and making other important achievements: uniform 
deposition, increased purity of the layers, low-cost processes. 
  Consequently, this opens up wide-ranging market prospects 
for 
new generation GaAs solar cells in Europe, both for CISE and the 
national aerospace industry, which has to date been conditioned 
by strong competition from German silicon technology. In 
addition to providing electricity for scientific satellites, the 
new technology should also meet with increased approval, with 
respect to silicon, in the vast and growing sector of 
mini-satellites for telecommunications, remote-sensing and 
environmental observation, industrial services because of the 
abovementioned advantages of reduced size and weight at the same 
price, higher performance levels, more reliability. 
  Though still at the early stages, this technology could also 
start being tested (as already happens in the United States) in 
applications on earth. The performance levels, which are double 
those of silicon, could promote research and new developments in 
single equipment for domestic use, the testing of concentration 
devices from current photovoltaic centers on new types of cells, 
or attract the interest of the Nordic countries, which receive 
less sunlight, in the new solar panels, given the increased 
performance of new GaAs cells in interplanetary spaces even at 
temperatures of minus 150 degrees Celsius and in the absence of 
light. It cannot be excluded therefore that thanks to GaAs, 
photovoltaic energy may still hold some good surprises in store.

  [Text] Rome (ANSA), 12 Jan -- A European mini launcher, 
able to put small satellites into low orbits by 1999 at a cost 
of less than $20 million each, is being studied by the French 
CNES [National Center for Space Studies] and the Italian Space 
Agency. The outline project for the rocket, that has been named 
ESL (European Small Launcher), is already ready and the 
definitive study, which should be finished by the end of June 
1994, is about to start. The French company SEP [European 
Propulsion Company] and the Italian company BPD (Fiat group) 
will participate in the study. 
  The determining factor for the new carrier will be the very 
contained launching cost: $20 million to put one tonne into 
orbit at a height of 700 kilometers. This cost is analogous 
with that planned by Lockheed for its new LLV mini launcher that 
should make its debut sometime this year. 
  A market comprising "numerous launches" each year can be 
foreseen for the ESL to meet European requirements alone. The 
small carrier could be used for telecommunications satellites to 
be put into low orbits ("constellations" of the Iridium type, 
Globalstar, Odyssey, Ellipso, Aries, Taos and other commercial 
satellites), for remote sensing in polar orbits, scientific 
research, and military applications (electronic monitoring, 
surveillance, and telecommunications). The payload (also for 
multiple launches) can vary from 100 kilograms to be put into 
any type of orbit, to 1000 kilograms in orbit at a height of 700 
kilometers. 
  The launcher should be extremely reliable (0.99) and have an 
acceleration that can be sustained without damaging the 
equipment (7G) that can be put into orbit with good precision. 
The payloads will be able to have a cylindrical volume 4.8 
meters high and 2.2 meters wide. Initially it is planned that 
there will be two launches a year, and these will increase later 
to between five and 10. 
  The ESL will be a solid-fuel, three-stage rocket (the same 
as 
the boosters of the Ariane-5) plus a final liquid fuel 
propulsor. The rocket will be 25 meters high, have a diameter 
of 2.6 meters, and weigh 121 tonnes. The thrust at take-off 
will be 173 tonnes. It is planned to use the same platform as 
for the Ariane-5 for the launch. The first two stages are 
identical, each one requiring 51.2 tonnes of fuel and built of a 
composite material (carbon fiber) which gives a six percent 
reduction in weight with respect to metal. The same material is 
used for the third stage that will require 7.2 tonnes of fuel. 
The fourth stage, which gives the final trajectory to put the 
satellite into circular orbit, will account for 260 kilograms of 
hydrazine that will feed six burners. 
  It is estimated that the investment for the development will 
be about 500 billion lire over four and a half years. If the 
realization of the project is approved at the beginning of 1995, 
it will be possible to make the first launch in 1999.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "CNES Already Preparing the </F>
Ariane 5 of 2001"] 
  [Text] The "Ariane 5/Evolution," an enhanced version 
of the new European rocket, will be capable of launching two 
geostationary satellites weighing 7.3 tons in all (in lieu of 
six tons). The development and building of this "Super AR5" is 
expected to take six years beginning in 1995. 
  The "Evolution of Ariane 5," as it is being envisioned 
today, 
was unveiled by the ESA [European Space Agency] and the CNES 
[National Center for Space Studies] at the Space Transport Forum 
that was held in Nancy at the end of November by the AAAF 
[Aerospace Association of France]. The heads of this program are 
already concerning themselves with the future of the new 
European Ariane 5 rocket even though its initial version, the 
AR5, is still under development and is not expected to fly until 
October 1995. It is already evident, however, that to maintain 
Ariane 5's commercial competitiveness, as competition grows more 
severe toward the end of the decade, and with satellites growing 
ever larger, Arianespace will rapidly have need of an enhanced 
version of the AR5. 
  The "Evolution of Ariane 5" program is intended to prolong 
Ariane 5's competitiveness by retaining its dual satellite 
launching capability, with satellites expected to weigh between 
3.3 and 3.8 metric tons according to the CNES. An American study 
published last April also concluded that by the end of the 
decade, "80% of the payloads will weigh less than 8,000 
lbs" 
(3630 kg). 
<H5>  7.3 Tons in Transfer Orbit </H5>
  Under these conditions, the goal of the Evolution of AR5 
program will be to launch two satellites weighing a total of 7.3 
metric tons between them into geosynchronous transfer orbit 
[GTO]. This represents an increase of slightly more than 1.3 
tons (+22%) over the capacity of the AR5 currently under 
development, which is designed to place approximately six tons, 
or exactly 5970 kg, in 600-36,000km/7 orbit. The AR5's 
performance objective in the case of a single-satellite 
launching into the same orbit is to be 6830 kg, and that of the 
AR5/Mk2 approximately 8.2 tons, or double the capacity of Ariane 
4 today (4.3 tons). 
  This sizable gain in performance must be achieved, however, 
without loss of Ariane 5's qualities. That is, without degrading 
the launcher's reliability, but also at the same time reducing 
the cost of the rocket, according to Nancy Remy Hergott, 
engineering assistant to the CNES's director of launchers. 
  To accomplish this, it is not a question of simply 
increasing 
the number of motors or the size of the stages, nor for that 
matter one of adding boosters or an upper high-energy 
(cryogenic) stage. All these solutions would be too costly and 
would augment the developmental risks. 
  The CNES proposes to proceed on the basis of two major 
steps. 
The first would be to augment the thrust of the Vulcain 
cryogenic motor and the weight of propellants of the AR5's 
central stage. This would produce a gain of at least 800 kg of 
payload in GTO. The second step would consist of augmenting the 
performance of the Aestus upper stage motor, increasing the 
weight of storable propellants (N204/MMH) from 9.7 tons to 14 
tons. This would result in a gain of around 400 to 500 kg. In 
addition, it is expected to be able to squeeze out another 100 
kg of gain by replacing the AR5's P230 dry-fuel booster links 
with welded joints. 
  These are the principal AR5 modifications being proposed, 
after its initial 25 to 30 flights, in order to arrive at the 
AR5 Evolution version, which would then be ready to enter 
commercial service in 2001. 
<H5>  A Super-Vulcain </H5>
  The Aerospatiale H155 cryogenic central stage will be 
modified to increase the total weight of propellants from 152 
tons to 172 tons (+13%). But overall volume is to remain 
constant. This is to be achieved by displacing the intermediate 
dividers of the tanks so as to increase the quantity of liquid 
oxygen relative to that of liquid hydrogen, and correlatively 
modifying the mixture ratio, from 5.3 to 6.2 (+17%). 
  In the case of the SEP [European Propellant Company] Vulcain 
cryogenic motor, this translates into a thrust increase to 1300 
kN (+16%), with a loss of specific impulse that will be 
compensated for by a modification of the exhaust nozzle. This 
modification will actually result in a slight overall gain (two 
seconds), increasing the specific impulse to 433 seconds. The 
motor weight will be increased (+9.5%) to 1750 kg. 
  The Vulcain's combustion chamber (its walls are cooled by 
ducting) will be modified by DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG] to 
increase its throat diameter, mixture ratio (+17%), 
pressure 
(+2%), and flow (+16%). The injector remains 
unchanged, as 
does also the hydrogen turbine pump. On the other hand, the 
oxygen turbine pump will be modified by Fiat Avio so as to 
include a 2-stage supersonic turbine (with blades machined in 
the disk and not flanged), enabling support of the increases in 
pressure (+7%), flow (+18%), and above all, power 
(+25%) to 
4.8 Mw. 
  The divergence of the nozzle will be enlarged, with section 
ratio increased to 60 (+33%). The upper part will retain 
the 
technology of the Vulcain, with cooling by a bleed-off of the 
fuel flow, which, however, will be reduced 
(-20%). The medial part is surrounded by the turbine gases 
injection ring. These gases also cool the lower skirt (which 
consists simply of bent sheet metal). This new nozzle, developed 
by SEP, DASA, and Volvo Flygmotor, is expected to begin testing 
on the Vulcain by the end of 1994. 
<H5>  L14 Upper Stage </H5>
  Generally speaking, and intentionally, the enhanced Vulcain 
will use well-known and, for the most part, proven technologies. 
The development of the Vulcain Mk2 and the modifications of the 
central stage could thus be completed in six years, the last 
three of them being devoted to tests of the new motor, which is 
to have the same reliability as the present Vulcain (0.946). 
  The other phase of the enhancement is to concern the DASA 
upper EPS [storable propellants] stage. Its tank is pressurized 
by helium, without turbine pump, and has actually already been 
improved, doubling its performance between the original L5 and 
the current L9.7 version. Its propellants capacity has been 
increased from 5 tons to 9,7 tons, its thrust from 20 to 27.5 
kN, its specific impulse from 316 seconds to 324 seconds, and 
its duration of operation from 810 to 1266 seconds. 
  This time, its performance is to be substantially enhanced, 
with an increase from L9.7 to L14. The stage will thus undergo a 
complete alteration but without modifying its architecture. Its 
tanks will be enlarged (by 700 mm) but made of lighter material 
(Al-Li in place of Alu 2219). This, says C. Ransom of ERNO 
[German Aerospace's Northern Development Consortium], will make 
it possible to add 4.3 tons of propellants (+45%) and 
raise the 
thrust of the Aestus motor to 35 kN (+27%). 
  The L14 will have exactly the same mechanical, electrical, 
and fluid interfaces as the L9.7, which will therefore continue 
to be used for other missions in low-earth and sun-synchronous 
orbits and for single-satellite launches into geosynchronous 
transfer orbit. The L14 will be used for dual launches requiring 
the full power of this "Super Ariane 5" beginning in 2001! 
  The following comparative table summarizes the contemplated 
modifications:

<F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "Turbomachines of the Future </F>
Being Designed by Computer"] 
  [Text] The ONERA [National Office for Aerospace 
Studies and Research] devotes eight percent of its activity to 
the improvement of Turbomachines, mainly through 3D simulation 
software. 
  Since their advent, turbomachines have undergone 
considerable 
development. Smaller and lighter, they are nevertheless more 
powerful, more economical, less noisy, and less pollutive. This 
ongoing improvement over the years has been owing to 
optimization of the geometric design of compressors, resulting 
in higher compression ratios; to the introduction of new 
materials that are resistant to higher temperatures; but also to 
new manufacturing techniques, particularly the drilling of 
microperforations by electronic bombardment, which enables the 
manufacture of higher-performance combustion chambers... 
  Further improvement is nevertheless still possible. And this 
is what ONERA, together with Snecma, Turbomeca, the SEP 
[European Propellants Company], and Microturbo, have set out to 
prove. Their principal objective is to develop numeric codes in 
three dimensions describing reality with greater and greater 
accuracy and capable of modeling the complex flows that take 
place in the components of the motor. Strategic points requiring 
study are compressors and turbine stages, with the continued 
object of augmenting compression ratios and efficiencies. 
  As veritable air-churning machines, these two components are 
the sites of complex aerodynamic flows. Studies have already 
advanced considerably in this domain, and manufacturers can 
already optimize the geometry of their compressor and turbine 
disks through the use of the CANARI software developed by ONERA. 
CANARI enables the modeling of the flow around an isolated 
wheel, in three dimensions, and with due regard for viscous 
effects. This operation requires four to five hours on a Cray. 
Unfortunately, this tool is applicable to a single wheel and as 
yet cannot simulate interactions between disks that create a 
nonsteady flow. Different tools have been developed to deal with 
this phenomenon. But these are either two-dimensional, or 
limited to nonviscous flows. "In a about a year, we should 
achieve a realistic 3D design tool," says Georges Meauze, 
turbomachines coordinator at ONERA. "Nevertheless, it will be 
three to four years before it becomes usable by industrialists. 
It will take that much time to reduce design times to reasonable 
values." 
  In addition to complex aerodynamic flows, turbines are 
subject to aerothermodynamic phenomena. Temperatures at the exit 
of the combustion chamber are very high, and this creates 
thermal stresses in the disks of turbines, modifying their 
temperature field, hence their radial geometry. This distortive 
phenomenon can have disastrous effects on efficiency, with blade 
losses becoming significant. MATHILDA design software, developed 
by ONERA, is devoted to this effect and is available to 
industry. It takes viscous effects into account in three 
dimensions. 
  These are all tools that must be validated. For this 
purpose, 
ONERA has numerous test facilities, that are constantly being 
improved, to simulate an ever-growing number of elements. It 
lacks one facility: An installation for simulating thermal 
effects on a turbine stage. The cost of building a "hot" 
facility would be excessive; so ONERA is studying the 
possibility of building a "warm" one... 
  Concurrently, research is being pursued on new materials, 
principally on superalloys intended for turbine blades and 
compressor disks...

Plant"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] All freshly molded and 
off the final assembly line in Toulouse, the biggest cargo 
aircraft of the Airbus series is now less than a month away from 
its first test flights. 
  Launched in July 1991 as the result of a contract between 
Airbus Industrie and Federal Express Corporation involving 25 
firm orders accompanied by 50 commitments to buy, the A300-600F 
program is the first aircraft of this class to be ordered in 
large numbers. 
  This first aircraft turned out by the plant comes four 
months 
after they began to assemble the first sections at German Airbus 
in Hamburg. This first aircraft will soon embark on a campaign 
of test flights lasting 45 hours. The objectives: to, of course, 
verify its aerodynamic properties, the good working order of its 
systems... but also--and especially--to evaluate the performance 
of the FADEC [Full Authority Digital Engine Control] of the 
General Electric CF6-80C engines. This last-named point is 
important for Airbus Industrie, which is using the GE CF6-80C 
with FADEC for the first time in its aircraft series. 
  In addition to the flight tests, a certain number of ground 
tests are planned to validate the freight-loading systems, air 
conditioning.... The verification and fine tuning of the 
"multiple choice" freight-loading system with its forward door 
area and rear area for handling containers have already been the 
subject of a certain number of tests in Breme. Furthermore, the 
aircraft is scheduled to be sent back to Hamburg in February, 
where the recently developed upper loading deck systems are to 
be installed. 
  This first A300-600F is then supposed to return to Toulouse 
in March 1994 to be prepared for certifications of the type DGAC 
[General Directorate of Civil Aviation], LBA [Germany's 
equivalent of the FAA], and FAA [Federal Aviation Agency] (the 
respective certification authorities of France, Germany, and the 
United States), which it is expected to jointly receive in 
mid-April, just before it is delivered. 
  The second aircraft of the series is at present in the 
middle 
of the assembly line in Toulouse, while the third and fourth are 
in different stages of production. Airbus Industrie plans to 
produce five or six aircraft a year. 
  According to the manufacturer, some customers have evinced 
interest in the aircraft, but no more orders have been reported. 
"Freight is a very specialized market that represents only a 
very small part of our line of products. Today, most air freight 
is transported in the baggage holds of commercial airliners."

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Meteosat 6 Takes Its First </F>
Picture of Earth"] 
  [Text] The new European weather satellite will be 
operational around the beginning of February and transferred to 
Eumetsat, which has chosen Ariane to also launch the three 
second-generation Meteosats beginning in 1998. 
  Last week, the European Space Agency [ESA] disseminated the 
first photo of Earth taken by the new European geostationary 
satellite Meteosat 6 launched by Ariane on 19 November (see AIR 
&amp; COSMOS no. 1449). Meteosat 6 was first placed in 
geosynchronous transfer orbit, and 37 hours later boosted into 
geostationary orbit at an altitude of 36,000 km. Injected at 
19W, it drifted slowly eastward, passing at 10W on 17 
December. There, it underwent a speed adjustment, enabling it to 
attain its final position by the end of January, at 0 
longitude, where it will be placed in operational service, and 
transferred to the European space meteorological organization 
Eumetsat, as of the beginning of February 1994. 
  But as of 29 November, Meteosat 6 took its first photo in 
the 
visible spectrum. It will not begin imaging in the infrared 
spectrum until the multispectral radiometer built by Matra 
Marconi Space has cooled. Matra Marconi Space is Aerospatiale's 
principal cooperating group. Aerospatiale is the prime 
contractor for the building of the seven Meteosat satellites. 
  Meteosat 6 will shortly replace Meteosat 4, which will then 
be repositioned over North America, to serve as a cyclone 
early-warning satellite beginning with the 1994 season. In this 
function, it will replace Meteosat 3, which is running out of 
fuel and will have to be replaced within a few months. Meteosat 
3 has been on loan to the United States since 1991. 
  The last of the series, Meteosat 7, is to be launched by 
Ariane around the end of 1995. At that time, the ESA will also 
transfer property and operational responsibility of all 
Meteosats to the Eumetsat organization, which will then operate 
the new MSG [Second-Generation Meteosat] satellites. 
  In this connection, Eumetsat's board of directors has 
settled 
on the choice of launcher for the future satellites and 
"approved the signing of a contract awarding to Arianespace the 
launching of all three MSG satellites." Charles Bigot, chief 
executive officer of Arianespace, confirmed to us the signing of 
this contract, effective 25 November, covering the launching of 
the three approximately 1.5 ton weather satellites beginning in 
1998. But, he says, the agreement also covers the launching of 
the European polar weather satellites Metop, by Ariane, after 
the year 2000.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicole Beauclair: "Windshield Testing by </F>
Infrared Thermography"] 
  [Text] Thermal imaging displays the distribution of 
temperatures. 
  Testing the performance of integrated deicing systems in 
certain types of portholes, windshields, and glass enclosures, 
is part of the total quality assurance of the products 
manufactured by Lucas Aerospace's Department of Engineering and 
Heating Systems. Whether made of pure glass, acrylic, or 
polycarbonate, or of acrylic glass, deiceable transparencies 
must respond to various stresses that necessitate in-process 
testing during manufacture. 
  To test the electric heating systems--a thin layer of gold 
and or indium oxide applied by vacuum deposition on the surface 
of the glass or other "plastic" material--of the windshields 
that it manufactures, Lucas uses Agema's thermal imaging system 
Thermovision 870, by means of which the temperature distribution 
over the heated surfaces can be displayed. The testing procedure 
consists of placing the windshield, with its heating element 
activated, in front of the infrared system. Without making 
contact, the Thermovision 870 equipment senses and measures the 
radiation emitted by the windshield. The resulting image is 
displayed on the monitor screen and compared with the 
thermographic pattern of a standard reference windshield. It 
takes less than two minutes to test the windshield in its 
entirety, with precision and without slowing the production rate. 
  The infrared testing technology replaces the thermocouples 
method, which required that 30, and up to 40, thermocouples be 
positioned on each windshield to obtain a plausible image of the 
temperature distribution, the Lucas company explains. And in any 
case, the thermocouples method was, at best, incapable of a high 
degree of reproducibility and could even generate an abstraction 
of what is actually a very localized zone. Another advantage of 
the Thermovision 870 system is that it permits the archiving of 
40,000 referenced thermal images on disk or magnetic tape.

<F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "European Certification of the </F>
Airbus A321"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Nine months after its first flight, the elongated 
version of the A320 equipped with V2500 engines is ready for its 
first delivery to Lufthansa, scheduled for 27 January. 
  The two A321 flight prototypes equipped with V2500 reactors 
supplied by International Aero Engines (IAE) had accumulated 605 
flight hours on 17 December 1993, when the aircraft was approved 
by the European certification authority (JAA). This paved the 
way for a first delivery to Lufthansa, the German airlines, next 
27 January. 
  The other two flight prototypes, equipped with CFM56-5B 
engines, already total 400 flight hours and are still being 
tested in Toulouse. This second A321 version should be approved 
by the JAA some time next March. JAA approval should occur 
simultaneously with that of U.S. certification authorities 
(FAA), for versions equipped with either engine. 
  Alitalia, who bought 40 A321 equipped with CFM engines 
should 
receive its first aircraft immediately after this certification, 
late in March. 
  The A321 is the elongated version of the A320, which means 
that it has a longer fuselage, as well as modified flaps and 
more powerful thrust engines (133.4 kilonewtons [kN] for the 
V2530-A5 engine, and 137.9 kN for the CFM56-5B2 engine, i.e. 
respectively 30,000 and 31,200 lbs of thrust). It also includes 
modifications enabling it to carry 185 passengers (or a maximum 
takeoff payload of 83 tons or 183,000 lbs) over up to 4,250 km 
(2,300 nautical miles) and at a cruising speed of up to Mach 
0.82, while benefiting from the experience of an aircraft that 
has been in service since 1988. 
  The Airbus Industrie backlog of orders includes 153 A321 
ordered so far by 11 clients. Deutsche Airbus, which makes them, 
has already assembled eight aircraft (including the four 
prototypes). 
<H5>  Production Authorization </H5>
  Simultaneously with the certification of the A321 IAE 
version, Airbus Industrie was just authorized to produce this 
entire aircraft line by French and German certification 
authorities (the DGAC [General Directorate of Civil Aviation] 
and the LBA [Germany's equivalent of the FAA]). This 
authorization will enable the consortium to complete on its own 
the compliance statement procedures for each unit produced in 
Toulouse or Hamburg. This obligation must be fulfilled before 
the certification authorities of the country of origin (in this 
case France and Germany) will issue the aircraft airworthiness 
certificate required for delivery. Until now, these procedures 
were completed by Bureau Veritas, a body approved by the DGAC.

  [Text] ONERA [National Office for Aerospace Studies and

equipped with a plexiglass combustion chamber. A Mach 1.5 hot 
air flow was supplied to the chamber (consisting of a short 
cylindrical section followed by a divergent), and a small amount 
of hydrogen gas was injected into a mixed supersonic speed zone 
located at the chamber inlet (this to help maintain combustion). 
Typical speeds at the chamber outlet ranged from Mach 1.1 to 
Mach 1.4, and combustion efficiencies observed were as high as 
87 percent, with equivalence ratios ranging from 0.49 to 0.66. 
In the present setup, however, losses due to the calorific 
intake and to friction against the walls resulted in a 50-70 
percent impact pressure drop throughout the chamber.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean de Galard: "Air France's Seven A340's </F>
Complete Over 9,000 Flying Hours"; introductory paragraph in 
boldface as published] 
  [Text] The manufacturer and the first airline to use 
the Airbus A340 present a quite favorable report on the 
commercial operation of this first European four-jet 
aircraft. 
  Seven A340's (three versions of the 200 and four of the 300) 
in service with Air France, 9,125 flying hours with 9,309 stops, 
a technical on-time departure performance of 94.9 percent 
compared to Air France's objective of 97.5 percent, and 25 
flights canceled for technical reasons. Those are some of the 
figures taken from the talk delivered to some 500 members of the 
AIR &amp; COSMOS Club last 11 December by Roger Doguet, A340 
division chief in Air France's Directorate of Air Operations. 
  With Albert Ducrocq, president of the AIR &amp; COSMOS 
Subscribers Club, presiding, the General Conference of the 
Cosmos Club of France was held on 11 December 1993, its topic 
being the Airbus A340. 
  The first lecturer was Pierre Baud, Airbus Industrie's 
director of flight tests, who summed up the history of the 
development of the A340 in its two versions and drew the 
conclusion that in terms of technical specifications, the A340 
has always performed better than required by contract, 
especially from the standpoint of everything having to do with 
fuel consumption. 
  Baud also emphasized the reasons for having fly-by-wire 
systems on board the family's most recent models--that is, the 
A320's, A340's, A330's, and A321's--pending the arrival of the 
A319. There are two reasons: first, their presence results from 
recourse, as is proper, to an ultramodern technology that has 
now been completely mastered by Airbus Industrie, and second, it 
constitutes a fantastic commercial argument in that it helps 
reduce by a very considerable amount the time required by a 
pilot qualified on one type of aircraft to also qualify on 
another type when both are produced by Airbus Industrie. This is 
because thanks to the fly-by-wire controls, the flight 
characteristics of all aircraft in the same family are so 
similar that a pilot who passes from one type of aircraft to 
another does not at all feel "like a fish out of water." 
  For his part, Roger Doguet discussed the A340's strong and 
weak points after nearly 10 months of service with Air France. 
Among the strong points: everything having to do with 
electricity, hydraulics, and instrumentation. Among the weak 
points: the fuel gaging system, among other things, since it has 
neither the reliability nor the accuracy required. Baud 
explained that its poor performance in that respect was due 
essentially to an FAA decision that was made when the A340 was 
already on the assembly line. That decision had to do with the 
installation of additional bulkheads in the fuel tanks. The 
problem is being solved. 
  Other very acute problems: the poor functioning of the 
toilets (with all the consequences that the lack of such a 
convenience can have during a 13-hour flight) and of the 
on-board intercom system (CIDS (Cabin Information Data System)). 
It is becoming very urgent to find permanent solutions to 
replace the temporary solutions that had to be come up with very 
quickly. 
  The addition of more A340's to Air France's fleet in 1994 
will make it possible to use the aircraft on routes to Cayenne, 
Quito, Lima, and Caracas and to begin service to the Far East: 
to Hong Kong, Osaka, Singapore, Djakarta, and Noumea. 
  Marc Dubois, who is in charge of the A340's commercial 
development, announced that 202,000 passengers had been carried 
on A340's by Air France, and he discussed ways of responding in 
the future to the wishes expressed by most of the passengers: 
those in business class are very demanding from the standpoint 
of comfort, while those in economy class want access to a video 
system even if they have pay for it. And many passengers want 
space on the aircraft for a "sociability" area, a "tranquillity" 
zone, or a real smoking room. The three-class formula might also 
be called into question. 
  Gerard Guyot, Airbus Industrie's chief flight engineer for 
flight tests, spoke at length about the record-setting 
round-trip flight between France and Australia that took place 
on an A340 last June during the Le Bourget Air Show, and he 
disclosed that originally, the plan had called for attempting a 
record-setting flight between Papeete and Paris.

<F P=106> [Article by B.B.: "Fokker 70 Halfway to Certification"; </F>
introductory paragraph in boldface as published] 
  [Text] The new Dutch twin-jet aircraft with 79 seats 
is continuing its test program with a view to certification in 
October 1994. So far there are 22 firm orders for the 
aircraft. 
  The Fokker 70 is now halfway toward obtaining its 
certification, which is expected in October 1994. Since its 
first flight on 2 April 1993, the prototype has made 195 flights 
and logged 250 hours, including 765 landings. The chief 
mechanical characteristics have been confirmed during this 
period: indicators and response to controls, flight envelope and 
stall limits, performance on takeoff and landing, and external 
noise measurements. The aircraft recently completed a two-month 
evaluation period in Spain (Granada), during which it flew more 
than 20 hours per week. The prototype has returned to its test 
facility at Schiphol (Amsterdam), where it will be equipped in 
January for a new series of tests that will include automatic 
landing with the AFCAS (Automatic Flight Control and 
Augmentation System) control system and verification of the 
performance of its engine (RR Tay 620), avionics (ARINC 700), 
and systems. 
  After being ferried to Cranfield in Great Britain, the 
Fokker 
70 will undergo tests aimed at verifying the behavior of its 
nose landing gear on wet runways. 
  Program officials are very satisfied at the moment. They say 
that takeoff performance exceeds expectations and that fuel 
consumption is lower than expected. Early conclusions point to 
flight characteristics similar to those of the Fokker 100 and to 
the possibility of improving the Fokker 70's carrying capacity 
by moving the center of gravity forward two percent. 
  Commonality with the 100-seat Fokker will make it possible 
to 
train the first crews on the Fokker 100 flight simulator. That, 
in turn, will make it possible to reduce the number of hours 
necessary for crew training by half. 
  Assembly of the first series aircraft (No. 02) will begin in 
February so that it will be able to participate in the 
certification program in August. The order book contains 22 firm 
orders: 10 for Sempati, five for Pelita (Indonesia), five 
(leased) for British Midland, and two (plus an option for six) 
for Mesa Airlines, the first North American customer. The 
manufacturing schedule calls for the production of two aircraft 
in 1994 and 15 in 1995. Sempati, which is the first customer, 
will take delivery of its first aircraft at the end of 1994 with 
the intention of putting it into service in March 1995. British 
Midland will receive two aircraft in 1995 and three the 
following year.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "A Little French-Italian </F>
Launcher"] 
  [Text] France and Italy are proposing a joint project for a 
new solid-fueled rocket that can launch small satellites 
weighing 1 t into a low orbit for $20 million. The rocket should 
fly by mid 1999 if development--estimated at Fr1.8 
billion--starts in 1995. 
  Both CNES [National Center for Space Studies] and ASI 
believe 
that there will be "a market for small satellites in a low orbit 
representing several launches per year for Europe by the end of 
the decade." The French and Italian national space agencies, as 
a matter of fact, have been putting their heads together for two 
years now (although with utmost discretion so far) on a subject 
that recently led to sketching a new project for a European 
mini-launcher, the ESL (European small launcher). The latter has 
just been presented to the "Space Transport" Forum organized at 
the end of November by AAAF [Aerospace Association of France]. 
  ESL is a French-Italian project involving both of these 
national agencies, although it was developed essentially with 
French and German industry, that is, Aerospatiale, SEP [European 
Propulsion Company], and DASA [German Aerospace Company]. But 
Italian industry will be more directly involved starting with 
the next phase that consists of a definition study (Phase A) for 
the future mini-launcher--according to joint French-Italian 
specifications--to be pursued for six months in 1994. As we were 
told by Remy Hergott, technical deputy to the Directorate of 
Launchers, CNES, it will be especially Aerospatiale and SEP in 
France as well as BPD (Fiat) in Italy that will be involved in 
this study. 
  1 t at 700 km for $20 million 
  ESL will meet a need that is being felt in Europe and 
elsewhere throughout the world for launching small satellites at 
lower cost. "The launch price tag is the decisive factor in the 
definition of the small launcher," emphasized J-M Astorg, an 
engineer with the Directorate of Launchers of CNES, in his 
presentation. According to him, the cost of 1 ESL flight has 
been set at $20 million (less than 120 million francs [Fr.]), to 
send 1 t over a distance of 700 km. That is roughly the price 
charged for a comparable performance by Lockheed for its new LLV 
mini-rocket that should make its debut at the end of 1995. 
  The French-Italian promoters believe that the market for a 
small European launcher will involve four types of 
minisatellites for the following purposes: telecommunications by 
constellations in a low orbit (of the type of Iridium, 
Globalstar, Odyssey, Ellipso, Aries, Taos, and other Orbcomm), 
observation in a polar orbit, scientific research (similar to 
what Sweden did with its Viking, Freja, and soon to come, Odin), 
and perhaps also military missions (involving telecommunications 
or electronic listening, in other words, reconnaissance). ESL 
could thus have to launch several telecommunications 
minisatellites annually weighing 200 to 700 kg (in 60-90 
orbits), at least one 200-500 kg scientific satellite and one or 
several observation satellites weighing about 500 kg (in a 
synchronous solar orbit at 800 km). 
  Typically, the range of performances expected of the future 
launcher in this mold will range from 100 kg on any orbit up to 
600 kg at 1,400 km or 1,000 kg at 700 km. The maximum payload 
will have to be dimensioned a little bit beyond those figures at 
about 1.4-1.5 t, and the accessible altitude will have to be up 
to 500 km, according to CNES. 
  The French-Italian rocket should have high reliability 
(0.99), bearable acceleration (7G), and good precision (4 km on 
the major semi-axis and 0.01 inclination) for single or 
double payload injection; the volume under the shroud will have 
a height of 4.8 m and a diameter varying from 1 to 2.2 m. 
  The future launcher is thus designed for maximum reliability 
and is intended to reduce the production and launch costs. 
Taking the deliberately conservative assumption of only two 
launches per year at the start of the operation, the market 
could have between 5 and 10 launches per year in the end. 
  121 t mini-rocket 
  As currently defined, ESL is a three-stage, solid-fueled 
rocket (the one used for Ariane 5: 68/18 PBHT [gross weight]) 
with a liquid-fueled terminal propulsion module. The rocket is 
25 m high and has a maximum diameter of 2.6 m (which is 
practically constant); it weighs 121 t. Takeoff thrust is about 
173 t; in a vacuum, it is on the order of 190 t. That is based 
on the launch facilities employed for Ariane 5 at Kourou and 
especially the AR5 mobile pad and the ELA-3 firing step. 
  The first two stages, P50, are identical in terms of size 
(2.6 m diameter) with just one nozzle adapted to operate both on 
the ground and in a vacuum (diameter 1.7 m). These P50A and B 
are each charged with 51.2 t of solid fuel in a composite shroud 
to reduce the mass ratio (to 9% instead of 15% 
metal). This 
carbon-fiber-wound structure will be made according to the 
technology used for engines of the M5 ballistic missile and the 
nozzle will be made with the technology of the AR5. 
  The third stage, P7, charged with 7.2 t of powder in a 
shroud 
likewise made of carbon fibers but with a diameter of 2.3 m, 
delivers a thrust of about 23 t (in a vacuum). The rocket, as a 
matter of fact, has a fourth stage with the liquid propulsion 
module (LM) integrated into the equipment compartment (2.6 m). 
This engine will take care of roll pilotage, attitude control, 
final trajectory correction, and circling in orbit. It carries 
260 kg of hydrazine (N2H4) supplying 6400-N nozzles. 
  As a possible alternative to P7, German Aerospace also 
studied a third stage, L5, with 5 t of liquid fuels (N204/UDMH) 
using the 27.5-kN Aestus motor in a version derived from stage 
P9.7 of AR5 (Cf., Air &amp; Cosmos/Aviation International, No. 
1451). Although its cost is comparable, L5 has little chance of 
being picked because it increases the acceleration at the end of 
propulsion and thus reduces the payload by 200 kg. 
  CNES thinks that ESL as defined now could be built for Fr1.8 
billion in four-and-one-half years. If development starts in 
1995, the new rocket could fly by mid-1999. 
  ESA, of course, would take over the French-Italian project 
to 
"Europeanize it," and that is as it should be. But so far, the 
Agency has displayed little interest in promoting a small 
launcher in Europe. Still, it recently began a study to evaluate 
the market and sketch the specifications for a small launcher 
that would meet this need. However, in view of the political and 
financial context, it seems doubtful that ESA could launch such 
a project soon, even if it were recommended by the study that 
will be completed in March 1994. 
  CNES furthermore believes that it must essentially count on 
French-Italian cooperation to build and finance the ESL. Remy 
Hergott thinks that Italy could finance a significant portion of 
the project (one-quarter to one-third) in which BPD (FIAT) would 
be mainly associated. Other European manufacturers would supply 
parts of the rocket. The shroud would be made in Switzerland 
(Contraves); the power module would be German (DASA) and the 
jacks would be Belgian (SABCA).

Successful Development of Energy Technology; partial study 2"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  IVA's Energy Council was formed in 1988 as a committee 
consisting of about 10 members from various departments within 
the academy. Its purpose it to assist the presidium and 
leadership of the academy with know-how and proposals for 
studies and other IVA activities, as well as with materials and 
advice for working out comments on legislation and other 
expressions of IVA's opinion on central issues with connections 
to energy. 
  Against the background of the then Swedish energy policy 
situation, the Energy Council's first two years in operation 
were primarily devoted to issues involving Sweden's future power 
supply in the short and medium term. In the fall of 1990, a few 
months before the so-called three-party agreement on energy 
policy was made public, the Energy Council decided to develop 
foundations for a new study. 
  The council wanted to raise the importance of energy 
research 
for the environmentally adapted energy system of the future from 
a longer perspective. The council regarded cooperation with 
players within the private and public sectors to be of vital 
importance in carrying out the study. Extensive informal 
discussions with representatives of companies and government 
organs were part of the preparations. The actual work on the 
study was begun after the summer of 1991. 
  The following organizations have supported the project 
financially: Asea Brown Boveri AB, the Building Research Council 
(BFR), the Development Foundation of the Power Plant 
Association- -VAST, the Ministry of Commerce, the Commerce and 
Technology Development Agency--NUTEK, Sydkraft AB, Vattenfall AB 
[formerly National Waterfall Agency] and the Research Foundation 
of the Steam Users' Association--AFORSK. 
  "Energy for Future Generations" had the Energy Council as a 
control group and was undertaken as three basic, partial 
studies, each with its own working group. All the studies have 
been published out as separate documents headed by the 
respective working group. 
  "Partial Study 1, Energy Research 1975-1992--Government 
Efforts, Ambitions and Results," analyzed the extent, 
orientation and results of Swedish publicly financed energy 
research. 
  "Partial Study 2, Successful Development of Energy 
Technology," analyzed preconditions for successful technical 
development and society's--primarily the government's--role. 
  "Partial Study 3, Energy Research: Options for the 2000s" 
analyzed technical possibilities, key technologies and 
development needs related to the energy field. 
  Further, the Energy Council worked out a summary with 
conclusions and proposals. This represents the council's 
accounting to the academy but it is also aimed at 
decision-makers within the public and private sectors. 
  This partial study was undertaken by Working Group 2, 
consisting of Lars Astrand, (chairman), Gunnar Engman, Lars 
Gustafsson, Per Hedvall, Sven-Erik Malmeblad, Professor Lars 
Nabseth, Jan Nordling and Dr. Engr. Hans Sandberg. 
  The secretary for the working group was Per Lekander, M.

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  Summarized Recommendation--see also Chapter 5: 
  Enterprises should not receive direct financial support for 
development of energy technology or investments in new energy 
technology. The subsidies which are granted in this direction 
should thus be abolished. On the other hand, society should 
stimulate continued basic R&amp;D cooperations and rapid 
spreading 
of R&amp;D results among enterprises. This can best be done 
through 
a certain increase in government support for jointly owned 
R&amp;D 
projects and development companies. 
  Society's most important task, however, is to create a 
climate for industrial activity which creates development power. 
The individually most important application area for improving 
the climate within the energy field is a more consistent, 
durable and in the long term credible fiscal and fee policy. 
Beyond this, it is essential, in order to improve the companies' 
supply of know-how, significantly to reinforce academic research 
within a few selective areas of technology, as well as in 
general to increase the opportunities of research to participate 
in international cooperation. 
<H3>  The Characteristics of Commercial Development of Energy 
Technology--see also Chapter 2: </H3>
  1. New technology affects society through its application. 
Ever so good technology which is not being used is therefore of 
limited value. 
  2. The company's incentive to carry out technical 
development 
is financial profitability. Since various R&amp;D projects fail, 
successful R&amp;D projects are characterized by very high 
profitability. 
  3. The time from project start to commercial introduction of 
new technology often turns out to be 10 years or more, after 
which it often takes another 10 years for projects to start 
paying off. Successful development projects therefore require 
patient financial involvement by the parties involved. 
  4. Successful product development projects are marked by the 
fact that early assessments and high-quality evaluations lead to 
a clear and early picture of the market and the properties of 
the product, which leads to the development of an effective 
product and market successes. Failed development projects are 
often due to the first assessments having been unclear. 
  5. New energy technology is mainly introduced in connection 
with new investments. Technology, particularly that which does 
not fit into existing systems, therefore achieves more rapid 
distribution during strong market growth, during structural 
changes or in industries where for other reasons there is a 
great deal of new investment. 
  6. On the customer side there is sound caution toward 
untested solutions. For large systems a commercially purchased 
reference facility of reasonable size is therefore crucial for 
further commercialization. 
  7. Well developed cooperation with the customer means that 
the necessary market orientation of the development work is 
facilitated and thus that the preconditions for success 
increase. This applies to both the development and the 
distribution phase. For development of large systems, 
cooperation with the customer is a prerequisite for success. 
  8. Energy technology is marked by high investment costs, 
long 
lifetime and high demands for accessibility of the systems. This 
leads to a certain inertia toward radical changes, and these 
take longer than in many other fields. 
<H3>  The Swedish Development of Energy Technology--see also 
Chapter 3: </H3>
  9. The Swedish energy technology development has largely 
been 
concentrated to a "technology triangle" consisting of the 
electricity-intensive basic industry, the power industry and the 
electrical engineering industry. A strong power industry and 
electrical engineering industry grew up in order to supply the 
growing basic industry, among others. A strong development need 
gradually emerged for being able to utilize the unique 
opportunities found in hydroelectric power, which was located at 
places other than the utilization centers. This led to expansion 
opportunities for the electrical engineering industry. It has 
been possible to apply the basic expertise that was created to 
other areas of technology, such as the field of nuclear 
technology. 
  10. The development usually took place in the form of 
development blocks, in which technology developers and 
technology buyers cooperated under business-like forms and with 
a distinct internal allocation of roles. 
  11. The Swedish development of energy technology appears 
unique from an international perspective. The development was 
facilitated by rapid market growth which made it easier to 
spread the technology, by successful sharing of risk between 
various players, by a stable surrounding world and, particularly 
during the post-war era, by a favorable financial situation. 
  12. Today, the development of energy technology in many ways 
faces a more difficult situation. The greater pace of changes in 
the rest of the world has led to higher concentration on short- 
term issues, the growth in energy use has decreased and the 
capital costs have increased. On the other hand, the more 
intense competition leads to more pressure on the companies to 
use their resources in the most efficient way, and the 
internationalized financial market makes financing of large 
projects easier, factors which stimulate technical development. 
  13. Within the power sector there is no longer any specific 
Swedish development of energy technology. As a result of growing 
development costs and reduced Swedish investment volume, the 
development costs must be spread over a larger market volume 
than the Swedish one. 
  14. Within the heating sector, a Swedish development course 
has a somewhat greater importance as a result of a larger 
domestic market, special needs by the customers and often lower 
development costs. In this field as well there is a growing 
internationalization, and here as well it is becoming less 
important to talk about a Swedish development course. 
  15. The deregulation and internationalization of the energy 
markets is putting the energy companies on a more equal footing 
with other industrial activity. This could possibly, primarily 
during the adjustment phase, lead to a certain reduced interest 
in sharing development risks. Just as for other capital- 
intensive processing industries, however, competitive advantages 
are to a major degree created by forward-looking investments in 
new technology, which is why the principal orientation will 
remain. 
<H3>  Society's Influence on Commercial Development of Energy 
Technology--see also Chapter 4: </H3>
  16. Society influences the technical development indirectly 
by changing the market conditions for technical development, 
here called climate factors, and by direct means of control 
aimed at the technology development or technology application, 
here called innovation support. In all, the climate for 
technical development has much greater significance for the 
technical renewal. 
  17. The long-range stability in government regulations, the 
interest rate level and the taxation and fee policy are three 
areas of particular importance for the climate of technical 
development in the energy field. It is further essential--which 
does not distinguish the energy field from other fields of 
technology--that there is a great deal of expertise in basic 
research and education and an economic policy which stimulates 
industrial activity. 
  18. Innovation support for companies has been given in three 
forms: regulation, financial means of control, and information. 
Regulations have been the traditional method to reduce the 
environmental consequences of technology application. In some 
cases taxes and other fees have been used for this purpose. 
Financial contributions have been the most common method for 
supporting certain technology developments. Tax relief has 
sometimes been used. Information has been sparingly used as 
innovation support. 
  19. Financial contributions for development projects have 
possibly in some cases accelerated an ongoing development 
process. In all, however, this support has not had any 
appreciable effects, neither positive nor negative, on the 
activity of the companies. 
  20. Taxes and fees, as well as regulations, have in general 
had much greater effect, but not always of the kind intended. 
  21. There are three main types of principal difficulties 
involving social support for the development of energy 
technology. The project selection fails for reasons of expertise 
and politics, the support is often not sufficiently 
long-lasting, or it has a negative impact on the natural 
innovation tendency in the companies. 
  22. By tradition, R&amp;D results have rapidly spread 
between the 
energy companies. The "marketization" which is under way could 
lead to a slower distribution of results and to more parallel 
work among enterprises. This should be opposed by reinforcing 
joint industry research. 
  23. Historically, the energy companies, and particularly the 
players in the "technology triangle," have been marked by a 
willingness to take technical risks when this was in line with 
the companies' strategic considerations. In principle this still 
applies. The sector is characterized by large companies with 
good opportunities for financing R&amp;D efforts. There is 
therefore 
no reason to assume that the energy companies in general are 
underinvesting in R&amp;D. 
  24. Steering the use of technology toward increasingly 
environmentally adapted technology is an essential social task. 
For that reason it is important that the environmental cost 
aspect is incorporated into the thinking. Regulations have often 
been more effective than environmental fees, which is likely to 
be due mostly to the fees having been exploited as an 
opportunity for taxation. These efforts must be credible, stable 
and as far as possible, undertaken in international cooperation. 
<H5>  1. Content and Organization </H5>
  This study analyzes how society should act in order to 
stimulate commercial development of energy technology. By 
commercial technical development is meant development, which 
from a shorter or longer perspective is aimed at methods, 
products or processes used in the market. 
  In Chapter 2 the technical development process, the forces 
behind it and the factors for success are analyzed. The 
objective is to answer the question: What determines the success 
for technical development projects and new technology, and to 
what extent is energy technology and the development of energy 
technology different from other technology development? 
  Technical development is also affected by factors of the 
surrounding world such as the companies' historical decisions, 
market development, competitors' actions, etc. In Chapter 3 the 
question is therefore asked: What has governed the orientation 
of energy technology development, and what are the effects of 
the structure and organization of the energy sector on this 
technical development? Also discussed in the chapter are ongoing 
and anticipated changes and their possible impact on the future 
development of energy technology. 
  Chapter 4 discusses society's role in the development of 
energy technology and the historical experience from government 
measures in Sweden and abroad. The main question is to what 
extent and in which ways society can influence the development 
of energy technology, and what the experiences of these measures 
are. 
  In Chapter 5, in conclusion, proposals are stated for the 
way 
society can stimulate commercial development of energy 
technology. The organization of the study is shown by the figure 
below [not included]: 
  In addition to the working group's own experience and 
evaluations, the study is based on three specialist seminars 
with about 15 invited theoreticians and practitioners. The 
seminars dealt with the issues discussed in Chapters 2, 3 and 4, 
respectively. 
  For each of these seminars a foundation report was worked 
out 
as supporting material. The reports from the first and third 
seminar, respectively, are given in Supplements 1 and 2 to this 
partial study, while the foundation for the second seminar forms 
its own report (AF, 1991). 
<H5>  2. What Characterizes Successful Energy Technology? </H5>
  In this chapter will be discussed future factors of success 
for technical development projects, factors which affect the 
speed of distribution for a new technology, as well as what 
distinguishes development of energy technology from other 
technical development. 
<H3>  2.1 What Characterizes Successful Technical Development 
Projects? </H3>
  By technical development projects is meant the entire 
process 
from idea to commercial product, by way of R&amp;D, product 
development, product adaptation, etc. A successful project is a 
project which leads to a product that sooner or later will 
generate profit. 
  Technical development is usually divided into basic 
research, 
applied research, production, demonstration and the distribution 
of the technology in the market. One often talks about the so- 
called development chain. The goal of basic research is internal 
scientific theory formation, and basic research has an intrinsic 
value, while other R&amp;D activities, in the shorter or longer 
term, are aimed at producing methods, products or production 
processes. It is often taken for granted that all the phases in 
the "development chain" must be passed through for technical 
development. This is not the case. Research is not a necessary 
first step for product development. Not even production 
development is always necessary for technical development. 
Learning effects which lead to technical development also occur 
in connection with undertaking other work. The last step, 
introducing the technology to the market, however, is a 
condition for the technology having an impact on society and 
thus leading to technical development in the actual sense. Thus, 
successful product development must lead to market-tested 
products and processes from which the technology developer as 
well as the buyer makes money. 
  The orientation toward results in product development leads 
to a difference in how research and development work. In 
commercial development work the effort is rapidly and 
effectively to achieve results. It may be said that research 
strives to talk about how something works. In product 
development, it is enough to know that it works, without for 
that reason having complete knowledge of why it happens this 
way. If difficulties occur in product development, there are two 
possibilities: "going around" the problems or compromising the 
performance characteristics of the product. Many elegant 
technical solutions involve precisely "going around" the 
difficulties. A good example of this from the case studies (see 
Supplement 1) is the HVDC [High Voltage-Direct Current] case, in 
which one actually never succeeded in solving the problem of the 
"backfiring" of the gas-filled rectifiers but it was still 
possible to use them as rectifiers by creating enough 
redundance. It is not very common that one succeeds by doing so, 
of course. Most usual is that one is forced to compromise with 
the performance of the product. 
  Often, it also turns out that in a certain phase it is not 
enough to know that the product works, but one has to know the 
physical foundations in greater detail in order to continue. 
This requires research and means that the course of development 
comes to a halt while waiting for these findings. 
  In principle, development projects can be divided into 
development of new generations of existing products and 
genuinely new development products of strategic importance for 
the future. A generational change is aimed at retaining 
positions in the marketplace and is the company's way of 
increasing competitive strength and profitability in the short 
run. Often, it turns out that by changing generations it is 
possible to reduce manufacturing costs or increase performance 
by up to 20 percent. New development projects mean strategic 
investments for the future, and it takes time before these 
investments become profitable. 
  In the meantime it is necessary for established products to 
generate profits ("cash cows") which can be used for the new 
development. Consequently, both types of projects must exist 
simultaneously, and a successful company thus works for both the 
long term and the short term at the same time. 
  The following section deals mainly with new development 
projects, although part of the reasoning can be applied to 
generational change projects. 
  Financial volume and development times vary greatly between 
various projects, product fields and types of technology. In the 
energy sector, as in other sectors of infrastructure character, 
the development is dominated by large projects and facilities 
with long technical and economic life. 
  The development costs for new technology are difficult to 
indicate precisely. Figures often include a great deal more than 
direct development costs and must always be treated with 
caution. The type of development processes which are described 
in Supplement 1, however, often involve direct development costs 
in the range of several hundred million kronor and up, usually 
followed by even higher costs for the first reference facility. 
  Figure 2.1 [not included] shows the time from idea to 
commercial product for 45 important innovations in Sweden during 
the postwar era. As can be seen in the figure, the times vary 
greatly around an average number of about eight years. Energy 
innovations are among the areas marked by long development 
times. Hence, it is not unusual to have development times of 
more than 10 years. 
  Distributing the technology in the market also proceeds 
relatively slowly, and perhaps for that reason it takes another 
approximately 10 years before the product has paid off its 
development costs. Such development courses naturally pose major 
demands for long-term involvement and financial stamina by the 
companies and, accordingly, require financially strong 
businesses. 
  Since the ultimate evaluation of whether the project was 
actually successful or not often cannot be undertaken until 
close to 20 years after the project idea, it is necessary when 
starting a development project to be assured that in the future 
the project will lead to financial and competitive advantages 
for the company. 
  The combination of high costs and long time frames have the 
result that the future profitability of the projects must be 
very high. Covering the cost of the project is therefore not 
enough of an incentive for the company to put its best 
development resources into a project. 
  The product development process can be divided into two 
phases: The search phase, in which a rather free search of 
alternative methods is made in order to solve problems and the 
product specification developed. In all, the search phase can 
consume up to 10 percent of the total development resources. 
After that, the development project itself ends. 
  The success factors[.sup]1[/] for a technical development 
project are many and the interplay between them is not always 
simple. Often it turns out, however, that successful technical 
development projects are marked by a chain of successes 
consisting of: 


    -  Early evaluations and high-quality assessments, which 
leads to 
  -  a clear and early picture of the market and the product's 
properties, which leads to 
  -  a strong product, which leads to 
  -  good market penetration. 

    One usually talks about "protocol" in the development work. 
With the "protocol" concept the entire development work is aimed 
correctly from the beginning, and this usually leads to a strong 
product. 
  All projects always include knowledge from outside. In 
Figure 
2.2 [not included] is shown a typology of various such methods 
for acquiring ideas and knowledge. It is thus not possible, 
necessary or desirable always to generate all knowledge oneself. 
Many insist that Swedish companies and Sweden on the whole have 
been particularly successful as regards acquiring knowledge from 
the surrounding world and converting it into new products and 
processes of their own. something which is particularly 
important for a small country. 
  The key to a successful development project is therefore to 
make the correct evaluations immediately in the initial phase. 
In order to do so, it is necessary to have a good and early 
product and system specification, which properly points out what 
market there is or can be expected and how to deal with it. The 
basic question is "When and how will the product be 
competitive?". On those occasions when the problem description 
(or problem definition) was lacking, was insufficient or even 
wrong, the projects usually failed. 
  The most common reason for such failure is that the market 
connection has been too weak. Experience from similar product 
development work provides better opportunities. Of course, the 
preconditions for successful evaluations increase if one has 
good knowledge of the customer of his needs. 
  A generally accepted truth is that new customers (new 
markets) are more difficult than new products (new technology) 
and the combination of new products and new customers is close 
to hopelessly difficult. This is because coupling the 
development to the market becomes considerably more difficult in 
this case. Well developed cooperation with the customer, with a 
knowledgeable potential customer, automatically leads to being 
able to enter marketing aspects into the development work and 
thus to being able to position the development work correctly 
from the beginning and increasing the opportunities for a good 
product. 
  At the same time as we earlier concluded that it is 
essential 
to have sufficient resources for development work, it is often 
not an advantage to have too many resources. Particularly not in 
the initial phase of development projects. This could lead to 
becoming careless with identifying the goal of the development 
work, which means that the development project is less well 
positioned and therefore leads to a poorer result. Once the 
search phase is concluded and the development project itself 
starts, it is often a major advantage to have large resources. 
Particularly for products with short production lives, the 
product must be quickly developed. This is facilitated by being 
able to pursue the development with parallel development paths, 
something which requires major resources. 
  As was stated above, successful development projects are 
often marked by close cooperation between the developer of the 
technology and an early, potential customer. In several of the 
case studies in Supplement 1, it is striking that there was 
considerable willingness to take risks by someone or both 
parties in the development work. Even in very large development 
projects this willingness to take risk can often be traced to 
some person or a small group of persons in leading positions. 
Without these "entrepreneurs" or "fiery souls," technical 
innovations do not proceed. It is essential to note, which can 
also be seen in the case studies, that the entrepreneur does not 
intrinsically need to be directly involved in the development 
work, but can very well be an early customer. 
  The incentive for the entrepreneur is usually the hope for 
financial profit, of course, and for that reason it is important 
for tax regulations, etc. to be designed in such a way that the 
entrepreneur has a clear financial incentive. 
<H5>  2.2 Spreading New Technology in the Market </H5>
  One proven experience is that Sweden has been successful not 
only in gathering R&amp;D experience from the rest of the world 
but 
also regarding rapid spreading of technology. This applies to 
the energy sector as well. 
  The factors which affect the success of a technology in the 
market naturally depend to a large extent on what leads to a 
successful development project. Well-developed, early 
cooperation with the customer appears to be the most important 
individual factor in this case as well. This means that many 
difficulties are automatically avoided. At the same time, the 
lack of such early customer cooperation means that so many 
difficulties accumulate that the product will scarcely succeed 
in the market. 
  New technology is often introduced in connection with new 
investments. If new technology is to achieve good distribution, 
it must therefore be available when the customer group has a 
need for new investments. This is particularly important for 
technology that cannot be applied to existing facilities, which 
is often the case for process technology. 
  In a growing market capacity must be expanded, while with 
zero growth new investments need only to be undertaken at the 
rate old facilities are taken out of operation. That makes 
spreading new technology much more rapid during strong market 
growth. The fact that nuclear power was able to achieve such 
rapid distribution in the Swedish energy system was made easier, 
for example, because the penetration took place in a market 
under rapid growth. Correspondingly, a strong structural 
reorganization leads to major opportunities for new technology. 
The rapid distribution processes which are provided in the case 
descriptions for the TMP [Thermo-Mechanical Pulp] process and 
the steel development in Supplement 1 should at least in part be 
seen in the light of the rapid structural change which occurred 
within these industries at the same time. These two sample cases 
also show that even in capital-intensive, mature, industries new 
technology can spread remarkably quickly, if suitable conditions 
prevail. 
  If investment willingness is low, the speed of distribution 
for new technology is usually slow. This will be the case during 
slow market growth, for example. This slow distribution is 
particularly striking in connection with a transition from a 
growth situation to a non-growth situation, when for a period 
replacement investments will be particularly small as a result 
of a relatively modern physical plant structure. 
  The most important individual property for the market 
penetration of the product, given that a need for the product 
exists, is the advantages offered by the product relative to 
previous products. Since business activity imposes demands for 
"measurability," the improvement, at least as regards producer 
goods, must be financially or technically measurable in the form 
of improved product performance or lower costs. Thus, it is not 
enough for the product to "be perceived" as better. 
  The course of the distribution is also affected by the 
product's compatibility with existing norms, standards and 
technical environment. Market penetration takes longer for 
technology which does not fit existing systems, technically or 
organizationally, or which, by being radically different or 
complex, are perceived as foreign by the customers. 
  The opportunity to test the technology on a reasonable scale 
also affects the course of the distribution. Technology 
involving technical risks which must be taken in facilities 
which are felt to be large by those involved have greater 
difficulties than where the technical risk has been dealt with 
in a comparatively small pilot facility. 
  One factor which in the case studies appears important for 
spreading the technology is the reference facility. Very high 
demands for accessibility of the products are often placed on 
process technology. At the same time, new investment has 
consequences far into the future. The result of this is that a 
buyer of such technology feels healthy caution toward untested 
technical solutions. It is therefore essential for distribution 
to build an initial, moderately large reference facility on a 
commercial basis, bought by a respected customer, known for 
being a good purchaser. Such a facility is important for the 
continued technical evaluation but still more important for 
making commercial evaluation easier for new customers. A 
demonstration facility not built on a commercial basis is of 
limited value, however. Although it could possibly show that the 
technology works, it does not facilitate the customers' 
commercial assessment in the same way. 
<H5>  2.3 Distinguishing Factors for Developing Energy Technology </H5>
  The factors of success in the previous section are mainly 
general, independent of the technical field. In this section is 
discussed to what extent the development of energy technology 
differs from other technical development. After that, the 
characteristics for cable-transmitted energy technology and the 
special consequences for those development patterns are 
discussed. This is because the development of energy technology 
in Sweden to a large extent involved cable-transmitted 
technology and technical components or systems which operated 
within the framework of cable grids. 
  What Characterizes the Development of Energy 
Technology? 
  Energy technology has many similarities with other process 
industry: 


    -  it requires large, initial investments 
  -  it leads to strong relationships of dependence between the 
energy supplier and the energy user 
  -  it poses special demands for careful production planning 
since 
the maximum production capacity is greatly limited, and 
  -  it poses particularly great demands on accessibility in the 
systems. 

    All in all, this results in the energy system having a 
considerable, built-in "inertia" against technical changes. 
Radical change of the architecture of the energy system is a 
process which ranges of several decades, while such a 
development in some other fields can be considerably faster. The 
development times for producing new technologies and processes 
are also comparatively long, which further reinforces the "long 
perspective" in energy technology development. 
  The special market structure with a few equipment 
manufacturers and energy suppliers is to some extent a result of 
the chosen technology. Only strong companies with considerable 
financial stamina and extensive technical know-how can cope with 
large, long-term projects of high technical complexity and large 
financial scope. This structure, in turn, has created special 
preconditions for long-range, close cooperation. The customers 
have known that there were supplier companies with a great deal 
of ability to satisfy their wishes. At the same time the 
supplier companies have met strong customers, often with stable 
social support, who have been able to risk a failed project 
without too much problem. The energy companies, between 
themselves, have also been marked by a striking openness, which 
is facilitated, of course, by the fact that there was no 
competitive situation. Historically, the development of energy 
technology is therefore characterized by having been conducted 
in an unusually cooperative environment and by market relations 
of a particularly lasting nature. 
  Something which distinguishes the energy field from several 
other fields with correspondingly high proportions of capital 
costs, such as the telecommunications field, is that the 
development of the operating costs, in this case the development 
of fuel costs, has turned out to be of decisive importance for 
the profitability of the investments. This is due to the very 
large fluctuations in raw material prices and taxes. 
  Of course, the energy field also differs because both 
technology and marketing questions have been affected by 
political decisions to a greater extent than in other areas of 
technology. This is true both in Sweden and in several other 
countries. It is also connected with the fact that society has 
quite favorable opportunities for influencing the development 
because of the close involvement of the energy sector with 
environmental and resource issues, and because society in 
several countries has been directly involved as owner in one or 
more of the energy companies, as well as the importance of this 
for the social development. 
  The Effects of Cable-Transmitted Technology on 
Development Patterns 
  A cable-transmitted energy system poses particularly high 
demands on the development in a number of respects. 
  A cable-transmitted system creates an even stronger 
dependence between supplier and customer. The customer has 
become dependent on an energy-supplying link and cannot easily 
change supplier if he is not satisfied. The supplier is also 
greatly dependent on his customers, since the investment made 
cannot be changed with ease. The customers are not quite as 
dependent on just one supplier, but can change to someone else 
if the cooperation is not working. The suppliers can also change 
the circle of customers during the lifetime of the investment. 
  Since the investment in a cable grid has a very long life 
and 
has the character of a "sunk cost" when it is completed, it has 
impact far into the future. The investment will thus affect the 
future scope of action. 
  In a cable-transmitted system it is not only on the 
production side that it is very important to have even 
utilization. It is just as important for utilization in the 
distribution system to be even, partly because the large amount 
of capital invested should be efficiently utilized, and partly 
because the maximum transmission capability is more limited than 
in a non-cable- conducted system. After all, there are 
ordinarily no possibilities of employing extra transmission 
capacity, as in the case of a non-cable-transmitted system. 
  Furthermore, there is usually not any storage possibility 
corresponding to the one in non-cable-transmitted systems. 
Production must take place at the same time as consumption, 
which is in some contrast to the effort for even utilization of 
the system and makes optimization extra difficult. This leads to 
cable-transmitted energy systems being marked by particularly 
large advantages of scale. By building large systems and 
coupling together production units and users with different 
characteristics, it is possible to achieve the desired balance 
at the same time as variations on both the production and the 
utilization side can be dealt with. 
  In sum, the factors mentioned above have the effect that the 
energy technology which is part of cable-transmitted 
distribution systems operates under special development 
circumstances. 
  At the same time it must be stated that there are 
differences 
in degree between cable-transmitted systems which are due to the 
fundamental architecture of the systems. In this case it is 
possible to distinguish between cable-transmitted systems on the 
one hand, which are first established locally in order later to 
be coupled into an integrated grid, and, on the other hand, 
entirely new structures which can be directly combined into an 
integrated grid. A system which is built locally and then 
integrated involves fewer initial investments but often, in the 
long run, poorer development possibilities than a system 
established from the beginning. 
<H5>  3. The Technical Development Within the Energy Industry </H5>
  The following chapter analyzes development patterns for the 
Swedish energy system. 
  After a brief description of the power and heating industry 
and its supplying industry and its structure, in section 3.2 we 
will discuss development patterns for the Swedish energy system 
and the development of the Swedish energy technology. In the 
concluding section we will analyze certain current development 
patterns as well as important future questions for the 
development of energy technology. 
<H5>  3.1 The Structure of the Energy Industry </H5>
  An energy system includes three principal types of players. 
Energy suppliers, energy users and equipment manufacturers, who 
deliver technical equipment to suppliers and users. While the 
energy suppliers and equipment manufacturers are clearly 
identifiable groups, the energy users are a heterogeneous crowd, 
which includes everything from very large customers, such as a 
steel mill, down to private persons. In the following 
description, interest is focused partly on the supplying 
industry and equipment manufacturers, and partly on the heating 
and electric power industry. 
  Producers of power and heat (meaning the power companies and 
the municipal power plants) in 1990 had a turnover of about 65 
billion kronor and employed about 20,000 persons (AF, 1991). 
This is somewhat less than the pulp and paper industry (73 
billion kronor) and automobile industry (77 billion kronor), but 
is, for example, more than three times more than the turnover in 
the telecommunications industry (23 billion kronor) and seven 
times more than the pharmaceutical industry (9.3 billion kronor). 
  Judged by the number of employees, the automobile industry 
is 
nearly three times larger, the pulp and paper industry twice as 
large and the telecommunications industry approximately the same 
size as the power and heating industry. The pharmaceutical 
industry has about one-third as many employees. The turnover per 
employee is therefore more than twice as high among power and 
heat producers as in the already very capital-intensive pulp and 
paper industry and nearly four times higher than in the 
telecommunications industry. A distinctive feature of the energy 
industry is thus an almost extremely high capital intensity. 
  Of the Swedish power production capacity Vattenfall owns 50 
percent, the industry 25 percent, the municipalities 19 percent 
and others six percent (applies to 1991). In comparison with 
other countries the ownership of the electric power production 
is well balanced between government, municipal and private 
interests. The power industry, and of course the municipal power 
plants as well, have traditionally been of an almost totally 
national character with a low degree of internationalization. 
Traditionally, there also has never been any extensive foreign 
ownership interest. A certain internationalization and greater 
international ownership has taken place in the last few years. 
The obstacles to entering the industry are high. Traditionally, 
legislation and concessions have in many cases made starting new 
businesses impossible. Although this is not the case, the 
opportunities for new establishment are comparatively small as a 
result of the very large investments required in many areas. 
  There are about 300 companies which distribute electric 
power 
in the country. The 10 largest power distributors have 37 
percent of Sweden's total subscribers. The largest distributors 
are Sydkraft, Stockholm Energi, Vattenfall and Goteborg Energi. 
  During the period 1970-1990 power consumption more than 
doubled in Sweden, from 63 Twh/year to 140 Twh/year (including 
transmission losses). This means an average rate of increase of 
more than 4 percent per year. Distributed over the period, the 
increase from 1970 to 1975 was a total of 26 percent, 1975-1980 
a total of 18 percent, 1980-1985 a total of 39 percent and 1985- 
1990 a total of seven percent. At present the growth is lower. 
  Just as the electric power industry, the district heating 
industry can be divided into a production segment and a 
distribution segment. In most cases a vertical integration 
exists between producer and distributor, which is why that 
division is not as obvious. District heat is delivered from hot 
water centers and thermal power plants. Characteristic of the 
industry is that there is major variation in size. The 10 
largest plants are responsible for about 50 percent of the 
district heat deliveries. The 100 smallest plants (about 
two-thirds of the number of plants) only represent about 15 
percent. The typical owner of a district heating grid and 
production facility is a municipality or a municipally-owned 
corporation. The largest suppliers of district heat in Sweden 
are Stockholm Energi, Goteborg Energi, Malmo Energi, Vasteras 
Tekniska Verken and Uppsala Energi. 
  District heat was expanded quite rapidly during the 1970's 
and the first half of the 1980's. No significant market growth 
can be foreseen at present outside the larger cities, since most 
areas suitable for district heating grids have already been 
utilized. 
  Several Swedish companies in the heavy mechanical 
engineering 
and electrical engineering industry have established their 
strength on the basis of delivering equipment to energy 
facilities. The dominant company, particularly in electrical 
engineering, has of course been ASEA/ABB. ABB companies 
operating in Sweden are big on light-water reactors, steam 
turbines, generators, high-voltage transmission equipment, 
switching gear, transformers, electric motors, control 
equipment, stack gas purification equipment, in order just to 
mention some of the most important product fields. 
  For delivery of large energy production components, such as 
furnaces or turbines, there are only a few suppliers in Sweden. 
When it comes to traditional steam boilers for power plants, 
there are no longer any manufacturers under Swedish ownership in 
Sweden. Suppliers for the Swedish market are, among others, ABB, 
AEG, Ahlstrom, Kvaerner and Siemens. 
  For smaller equipment details within the energy industry, 
such as transformers, switching equipment, valves, pumps, etc. 
there are several suppliers, of whom a few foreign ones, such as 
Siemens, also have a small production in Sweden. 
<H3>  3.2 What Characterizes the Swedish Development of Energy 
Technology? </H3>
  The development of energy technology in Sweden in several 
respects equals the technical development in the electric power 
sector. By that is not meant that the development has solely 
involved electrical engineering, but that the development was 
undertaken with a view toward the needs of the electrical 
sector. This emphasis can be traced to the establishment of the 
energy system and to the composition of Swedish industry. 
  For a long time Swedish industrial development was mostly 
equivalent to the development of basic industry. The principal 
task of the energy sector became to supply this trade of such 
vital importance to Sweden with sufficient quantities of 
sufficiently cheap energy. Gradually, a considerable mechanical 
engineering industry also appeared, which, to be sure, did not 
require large amounts of energy but nevertheless depended on an 
assured supply primarily of electric power. Guaranteed 
deliveries of sufficient amounts of electric power at 
competitive prices thus quickly became a condition for the 
ability of the initially strongly export-oriented Swedish 
industry to compete. This required a strong power industry. 
  At the beginning of the century the supply and use of 
electricity was local. With increasing demand greater capacity 
was needed. The power industry realized at an early stage that 
the special Swedish situation with major natural resources, 
located in completely different places than the consumption 
centers, would be able to provide unique opportunities for 
solving the electric power supply in a rational and 
cost-effective way. There was talk during this period of "the 
white coal" (that is to say hydroelectric power) and how it 
could be utilized. 
  The technology to do so was not available, however. The 
powerful need for development created expansion opportunities 
for the Swedish electrical engineering industry headed by ASEA. 
This development provided basic technical know-how and player 
relationships which could be used as a foundation when the 
expansion of hydroelectric power was completed and other 
technical systems were needed to meet the constantly growing 
need for electricity. The establishment of the nuclear power 
industry, above all, is an example of this. 
  The typical pattern for the development of the Swedish 
energy 
technology has therefore been that technology was developed in 
order to meet needs within the Swedish energy system. These 
products, and the knowledge and expertise which have accumulated 
in the tracks of this development, have then in several cases 
become internationally successful products. Some outstanding 
examples of this are, for example, ASEA's high-voltage 
transmission equipment, for alternating current as well as for 
direct current, turbines, primarily from ASEA STAL, and ASEA 
ATOM's nuclear reactors. 
  One may speak about there being a "technology triangle" 
between ASEA/ABB and the power companies (primarily Sydkraft and 
Vattenfall) and the electricity-intensive industry (chiefly the 
pulp and paper industry and the iron and steel industry). It is 
in the interface between these industries that development needs 
and technical know-how have been found, so that meaningful 
development cooperations could be established. Large projects 
which involve long-term commitments and have long repayment 
periods pose major demands on careful coordination. The result 
of this is that technology development is made easier by a 
guarantor, who assures the long-range involvement of the 
parties. Several of the development projects are marked by the 
existence of such a guarantor. The relationships are explained 
by the figure below [not included]. 
  The development has often assumed the character of 
development cooperations and has often taken place under 
businesslike forms, in which the roles of the various players 
were clear and expressed. The fact that precisely Swedish 
players cooperated therefore is not due to any forced Swedish 
protectionism, but to the fact that it was actually more 
rational. 
  There are several examples of this type of development 
cooperation in Sweden, even outside the field of 
energy[.sup]2[/], and Dahmen has coined the expression 
development blocks to describe similar processes in his study of 
the Swedish industrial development during the period between the 
wars (Dahmen, 1950). 
  In certain cases these development blocks consisted directly 
of cooperation between a couple of companies. The cooperation 
between ASEA and Vattenfall regarding high-voltage technology 
represents such an example. An important and well-known example 
in which a guarantor facilitated the development is Stockholms 
Enskilda Bank's activity at the beginning of the century, when 
the bank through favorable credits facilitated the expansion of 
hydroelectric power and greatly participated in establishing 
ASEA as a company (Gasslander, 1956). Nuclear power represents a 
clear example of a development block in which close cooperation 
between several players, different ones at different times, 
brought the development forward. For nuclear power the state 
assumed an essential role as a guarantor in order to make the 
development easier. Even in recent times there are examples that 
such development blocks have originated. The foremost example is 
the development of large heat pumps, in which ASEA STAL and the 
municipal thermal power plants, by acting with foresight, were 
rapidly able to preserve the potential of the heat pump in the 
district heating grids. 
  The development of new technology has not been wholly 
concentrated to the technology triangle, of course. But the 
Swedish energy sector must still be said to be characterized by 
the fact that it includes strong and weak partial sectors from 
the aspect of development. By developmentally weak partial 
industries we mean that they tends to underinvest in technical 
development as a result of a lack of incentive. The usual 
opinion is that primarily the construction sector and the 
municipal energy plants represent these developmentally weak 
sectors. 
  In the construction sector these problems are on the product 
side. The problem has not been general, but was mainly linked to 
the multi-family dwelling sector. Technical development was 
undertaken in order to meet stiff and rigid product standards 
rather than actual product development needs. In combination 
with a nearly insatiable demand for the products, the 
development pressure was thus very low. The reduced regulatory 
control which now marks the construction sector, in combination 
with a more normalized demand which leads to greater 
competition, can be expected to increase the incentives for 
development in the future. This is demonstrated above all by the 
experience in the small housing sector, where competitive 
pressure has been higher and development more favorable. New 
building standards resulted in electrical power during the past 
10 years being the only financially justifiable alternative in 
small houses. The fact that electric heat was installed in turn 
resulted in the market having introduced an insulating standard 
at a higher level than prescribed by the standards. The 
development in the small housing sector shows that the market 
functions even as regards more efficient energy if provided with 
favorable opportunities. Not even in the construction process 
itself have there been any corresponding tendencies toward 
underinvestment. On the contrary; Swedish companies were 
responsible for a considerable part of the international 
technical development involving the construction process. 
  That the municipal power plants represented a 
developmentally 
weak industry is primarily explained by the fact that there were 
weak owners. The owners were influenced by interest groups which 
wanted the municipal energy plant to keep the rates as low as 
possible in the short run, which necessarily created 
difficulties for the companies in undertaking projects of an 
R&amp;D 
nature, which in the short term predominantly mean higher costs 
for the company. This tendency was reinforced by the ample 
support which was given. The investment patterns have changed, 
so that the government had to put up a significant part of the 
costs. Without the subsidies the owners would most likely have 
had to assume greater responsibility for the companies' 
development, so that the presence of financial development 
subsidies contributed to a poorer development than what would 
otherwise have been the case. 
<H5>  3.3 Why Did the Development Turn Out This Way? </H5>
  A few factors seem particularly important in order to 
explain 
the development: 


    -  The development of the market 
  -  the interplay and relationships between the various players 
  -  the conditions of the surrounding world. 

    It is in this connection essential to distinguish between 
the 
earlier development, up to the mid-1970's, and the changes which 
have occurred since then. 
  The Earlier Development 
  The lasting, strong growth in energy, and particularly 
electricity, consumption created a powerful need for new 
capacity. This opened up major market opportunities for 
innovative companies. The rapid growth also reduced the 
investment risk for the power companies. In that strong growth 
situation it was not a direct catastrophe for a company in a 
monopolistic situation if capacity "happened" to be expanded 
somewhat to quickly. After only a few years new demand 
developed, which caused the facility to be needed. 
  Regarding the player structure, it can be noted that 
cooperation has taken place between quite large companies and 
that there have been close relationships and major confidence in 
one another's capability. Accordingly, one has been convinced 
that the problems could actually be solved, and if any project 
were to fail, contrary to expectations, the parties would manage 
to accept financial failure without insurmountable difficulties. 
At the same time it was obvious that the buyer side would assume 
some of the risks with the development work.[.sup]3[/] 
  It should also be noted that there was strong government 
involvement as support for this development. Other than in 
exceptional cases, the support did not affect technical or 
commercial questions but meant that the players could anticipate 
that the rules of the game in the cooperation would not 
drastically change during the course of the work. The companies 
could thus use long depreciation periods for new investments, 
since one was acting in a politically and market-wise very 
stable environment. The government also influenced the 
development through the heavily regulated credit market, since 
there were low nominal interest rates and there was plenty of 
capital because of the extensive public savings, for example. 
  The Later Development 
  During the most recent 20-year period, the conditions for 
energy technology have gradually changed. Market opportunities 
have changed both for the industrial and the energy companies. 
The costs of technical development have also risen. 
  An often represented view is that Swedish industry has 
become 
more short-sighted during the 1970's and 1980's. It is quite 
clear that over the more recent 25-year period the majority of 
industrial companies has encountered a faster pace of change in 
the surrounding world, including, for example, more rapid market 
changes and greater international competition. As a reaction to 
this greater pace of change in the rest of the world, in the 
late 1960's an altered leadership philosophy emerged within the 
manufacturing industry. Quarterly balance sheets, 
divisionalization and profit units created more pressure on 
company managements always to show a good result. The trend was 
reinforced by the wave of incorporations and dispersions of 
ownership during the 1980's. In all, this development has been 
favorable by creating greater pressure on company managements to 
work more actively with the firms' development, but at the same 
time it has, of course, heightened interest in the company's 
short-term goals. Greater concentration on short-term issues 
does not, however, as has sometimes been indicated, necessarily 
mean lower efficiency in the long term. If the surrounding world 
has changed, it is necessary to undertake measures against or 
adjust to these changes. At the same time there is obviously 
risk that focusing on the long term, which is also necessary for 
the company's long-range success, may be neglected in this 
process. 
  The energy companies also faced a less predictable future 
during this period. The energy price fluctuations had been a 
constant problem since the beginning of the 1970's. The price 
fluctuations were reinforced by the effects caused by varying 
taxes and environmental fees. Often there were also subsidies 
available for new investments, which further increased the 
uncertainty about the cost of various alternatives. Add to this 
the political uncertainty about the future of nuclear power, 
which meant that there was some risk that 50 percent of the 
electric power production capacity would need replacement in the 
short term. 
  As for the market development, the 1970's represented a 
clearly lower rate of growth. According to the official energy 
statistics, the energy consumption even decreased.[.sup]4[/] 
In the early 1980's the simultaneous economic boom, conversion 
to electric heat, and the expansion of the district heating 
grids led to rapid market growth in both the electric power and 
heating sector. On the electric power side, this development 
was, of course, facilitated by the fact that new nuclear power 
plants rapidly entered the system in the late 1970's and early 
1980's. The rate of growth in recent years, even regardless of 
the effect of the economic conditions, has decreased as a result 
of greater energy efficiency and the fact that conversion to 
electric and district heating has halted. This limited growth 
has not required new production capacity to any major extent, 
and new investments during the second half of the 1980's have 
been very limited, in the area of power as well as of heating. 
  The higher interest rate situation has also had a major 
impact in the direction of projects with a short period of 
repayment. This applies to both industrial and energy companies. 
  The opportunities for technology development have also 
changed. Swedish reference facilities and operating experience 
have been very important for the further commercialization of 
new technology. A certain change has occurred, however, which 
can be exemplified by the dominant company in the field in 
Sweden, ABB. Sweden is still an important domestic market for 
the majority of ABB companies active in Sweden, of course. 
However, during the 1970's and 1980's an internationalization of 
the electrical engineering industry took place, which resulted 
in Sweden no longer having the same character of "springboard to 
the world" for ABB as was the case for ASEA. Previously, the 
company essentially searched out development problems in Sweden 
and developed products for the Swedish market, which were then 
adapted for other markets. Nowadays, the technical development 
in the electrical engineering industry takes place for the 
international market, and the Swedish market no longer occupies 
the same special position. The corresponding development also 
applies to many other companies, small as well as large, which 
are active in the infrastructure field.[.sup]5[/] 
  One driving force behind this development has been higher 
development costs as a result of increasingly advanced and 
complex technical systems, which means that the development 
costs must be distributed over a larger market. That provides 
increasingly fewer opportunities for special national solutions 
in markets which are comparatively small, such as the Swedish 
one. Another important driving force in Sweden is that the 
combination of lower market growth and a modern establishment 
structure has meant that there was no need for new facilities 
after the introduction of nuclear power. This forced the 
industrial companies to direct their eyes even more toward the 
needs of the surrounding world. Altogether, this has the result 
that there is increasingly less relevance in speaking of 
specifically Swedish technology development in the energy field. 
It applies to a particularly high degree in the electric power 
sector. The same development trends can also be noticed in the 
heating sector, however, although this development is somewhat 
later in time as a result of generally lower development costs 
and a larger domestic market. 
  All the factors given above contributed to the generation of 
fewer long-range development projects in Sweden in the energy 
field over the past 10-15 years, compared to what was previously 
the case. 
<H5>  3.4 Development Trends for the Future </H5>
  In this section will be discussed development trends and 
their potential effects on the technical development. Just as 
all other predictions for the future, these must be treated with 
caution. 
  There are a number of indications that both the electric 
power and the heating market in Sweden and in our immediate 
environment face a historical break with the trend. Even if 
industrial growth during the 1990's will be good, which is 
desirable, it is likely that the growth in energy consumption 
will be of limited extent. At the same time the physical plant 
structure is relatively modern and, particularly in the area of 
electric power, a certain increase in demand could be met by 
increasing output from existing facilities. The greater European 
integration of electricity systems simultaneously leads to more 
efficient utilization of existing reserves and for that reason 
they can be shrunk from an overall point of view. In general, 
this argues for a limited need for new construction of power and 
thermal facilities for quite a long time, at least 10 years, 
which has a considerable impact on the penetration of new 
technology, especially against the background of the modern 
facility structure. Remodeling, for example as a result of 
stricter environmental requirements, and current maintenance and 
modernizations will take place, but these are measures of 
comparatively limited extent. 
  New investments could, of course, occur even over a shorter 
time frame, in that case probably for reasons of competition in 
the wake of the now ongoing regulation. If a more extensive 
export market for electric power should develop, this could also 
lead to new investments. 
  Nuclear power still represents an uncertainty factor, of 
course, with considerable consequences for the plans by the 
energy companies, since it will affect the time at which new 
production capacity will be needed. If nuclear power is to be 
abolished by the year 2010, very extensive new construction will 
have to be started within a 10-year period, while more extensive 
replacement investments can otherwise wait. Since new technology 
is introduced in connection with new investments, and nuclear 
power abolition will lead to a forced investment wave, the 
opportunities for rapid spreading of new technology will be 
greater if nuclear power is abolished. That this is the case 
should not be interpreted as this report advocating such 
abolition. Spreading new technology is not an end in itself. 
  Even the continued development of scientific knowledge in 
the 
area of climate could lead to continued political uncertainty 
for a long time. 
  An interesting development with potential consequences for 
technical development is the deregulation of certain energy 
markets which is under way. This "market-liberal" wave, which is 
an international phenomenon and includes, among other things, 
greater private ownership of energy companies, leads to a 
gradual transition from an express social service role in the 
direction of greater similarity with other industrial activity, 
including the same demands for financial profit for the owners 
and with a position that is tangibly more exposed to 
competition. Express social responsibility, for example in the 
form of delivery obligation and cost-based pricing, is beginning 
to dissolve. The role more similar to other industrial activity 
also includes introducing competition for customers. Previously, 
the energy companies had an assured customer base. Other 
companies were excluded through the concession. When the market 
is opened up, the producer does not sit as securely in his 
market, which introduces an additional element of risk into the 
commercial evaluation of new investment projects. 
  Against the background of the factors mentioned above, it 
appears likely that the companies' orientation to some extent 
will be guided toward activities that pay off more rapidly. This 
could have the consequence of reduced willingness to assume 
risks for long-range and uncertain technical development 
projects. 
  At the same time, experience in other areas indicates that 
competition stimulates technical development by increasing 
pressure on the organizations to use their resources in the most 
efficient manner. Experience from other technically similar 
industries, such as the chemical engineering industry or the 
forest industry, indicates that there is no conflict between 
short-term economic profitability and investments in long-term 
technical development and new technology; rather, the opposite. 
In a market exposed to competition, short-term profitability is 
a precondition for companies investing sufficiently much in 
R&amp;D 
and daring to undertake purchases of previously untested 
technology. Naturally, it is necessary to have the simultaneous 
capability and resources to do this. 
  Accordingly, the reduced risktaking indicated above is 
likely 
to be primarily a temporary phenomenon, which will mark the 
energy industry in the restructuring phase now under way. In the 
long run, competitive ability is created in this industry, just 
as in most other types of industrial activity, largely by 
investment in new technology. When the companies have found 
their new positions, the view of new technology will not be 
fundamentally different from what has traditionally been the 
case. 
  As was previously mentioned, we in Sweden used to have a low 
real interest rate for energy investments, that is to say the 
energy price increase was close to the nominal interest rates 
which favored major investments. Today, we have a deregulated 
credit market with high interest rates. There is much indication 
that the tendency of comparatively high interest rates and low 
inflation will continue for the future. This could affect the 
development in the direction of less investment-heavy technology 
and toward technology which involves shorter repayment periods. 
As a counterbalance to this tendency, there is now at the same 
time an internationalized credit market. This results in an 
equalization of the financial terms, and the internationalized 
capital market is likely in the long run to lead to more 
effective financial markets and thus to a certain downward 
pressure on interest rates. 
  One question for the future is whether today there is any 
relevance whatsoever in the technology triangle earlier 
described. As was mentioned in the previous section, the ties 
between the electrical engineering industry and the power 
industry have weakened, primarily as a result of the 
globalization of the supplying industry. The now ongoing 
deregulation of the electric power markets is likely to mean 
that the relationship between the power industry and the 
electricity-intensive industry will be affected. To a certain 
extent the power industry can be expected to focus a greater 
part of its interest on higher-paying customers in other 
countries. Society's role of stronger emphasis on market 
solutions, which is supported by the present EEA [European 
Economic Area]/EC adjustment, will further weaken the technology 
triangle, and for the future one might thus question whether it 
is not more or less in the process of dissolving. 
  With the greater internationalization in the wake of the 
EC's 
internal market, major changes are under way with general impact 
on society. The change in the financial markets and the 
transportation market will be especially great, of course. In 
the energy sector as well the consequences will be significant, 
although it is difficult to predict exactly what these changes 
will be. However, this increased internationalization further 
accentuates the need for acquiring knowledge and technology from 
the surrounding world. 
<H5>  4. Society and the Development of Energy Technology </H5>
  The following chapter discusses society's opportunities to 
influence commercial development of energy technology. The 
discussion is supplemented by the case study material which is 
given in Supplement 2. Society's impact on technical development 
can in principle be divided into two categories: 


    -  Efforts which influence the climate for technical 
development in society 
  -  efforts which are more directly aimed at stimulating all or 
certain innovation activity ("innovation support"). 

    The main purpose of this chapter is to discuss the latter 
activity. Since, during the course of the work, it has become 
increasingly clear that a favorable climate for technical 
development generally speaking is of much greater significance 
for the firms' development strength, we will begin by taking a 
closer look at climate factors of particular importance 
precisely for the development of energy technology. 
<H5>  4.1 The Climate for Technical Development </H5>
  The development which was described in the previous section, 
with more international competition and weaker national 
networks, further accentuates, if that is possible, the 
importance of the innovation climate for development. In order 
to be competitive, it is probably not enough for Sweden to have 
an innovation climate that is as good as in other countries. 
Sweden, with a small domestic market, large distances to 
customer markets, a minor language, etc., must, in order to 
compete, have a more favorable climate for industrial activity 
compared to those countries which have better preconditions 
because of size and geographic location. Five especially 
important climate factors for the development of energy 
technology have been identified: 


    -  Basic research and education 
  -  long-range stability in government regulations 
  -  the interest rate level 
  -  energy taxes and fees 
  -  general economic policy (inflation, tax burden) 

    Of these, the first and last ones are likely to be important 
in general, while the three in the middle are of special 
significance for the energy sector. This is due to the 
dependence on the long perspective in investments and the high 
capital intensity. 
  A great deal of know-how in basic research and education is 
essential, partly because of the research results as such, but 
perhaps to at least as large a degree as a source of good 
personnel for the companies. Competency in academic institutions 
is satisfactory in principle. However, there are areas in which 
society should try to strengthen the expertise. The fields most 
important to industry to which this applies is electric power 
technology and nuclear technology, fields which tend to be 
neglected in the government's major concentration on energy 
research. Previously, commerce and industry to some extent tried 
to compensate for this through its own efforts in academic 
institutions, which turned out not to be easy, in part because 
of the management forms of the institutions. 
  It is necessary for the political decisions of importance 
for 
the industry to be stable and have long-range credibility. In a 
situation where decisive factors affecting decisions cannot be 
predicted at all, the companies increase their concentration on 
the short-term perspective. Measures which offer extremely high 
flexibility will also be prioritized. Overall, these flexible 
solutions are not always the ones which would be most rational 
in a more stable environment. Long-range activities, 
particularly those which involve considerable commitments for 
the future, are shelved while waiting for the ability to have a 
better overview of the conditions. 
  As was mentioned in Chapter 2, the development of operating 
costs has often turned out to have a fundamental effect on 
profitability, because of the price development for energy raw 
materials and for the fiscal and fee policy. The market 
fluctuations in the raw material markets have been difficult to 
predict, particularly since 1973. By introducing yet another 
uncertainty in the form of variations in taxes and fees, the 
problems have become nearly insurmountable. During the 1980's 
the municipal energy companies, above all, operated in a very 
difficult environment in this respect, and the investments made 
in coal technology, for instance, during the first half of the 
1980's, supported by the government, turned out to be less 
successful after the state, within the course of a few years, 
raised the coal tax from zero to a level approximately three 
times higher than the coal price. 
  In one important respect, tax changes introduce an even 
greater assessment difficulty than normal market changes. Market 
changes are cyclical in nature. At the same time, investment 
decisions often have a lifetime spanning several market cycles. 
The result is that investment decisions contrary to the market 
development, if one succeeds in "overwintering" the downturn 
phase, often still turn out to be fortunate in the long term. 
Government regulations do not have this cyclical nature, which 
is why a decision that is "wrong," because future changes in 
government regulations were misjudged, rarely turn out to be 
fortunate. 
  The varying taxes on energy have not only increased market 
uncertainty, but have also had an immediate negative impact on 
the technical development by reducing the incentives for 
technical development. This effect can also be exemplified with 
the situation regarding the tax on coal. The proportion of tax 
of the total cost for coal mentioned above has varied greatly 
over a short time period. I today's situation coal can be 
converted to electric power using the most efficient and best 
environmentally adapted technology, with an efficiency of more 
than 40 percent. The hope for the new coal gasification 
technology is to be able to achieve an increase in efficiency of 
about 5-7 percent over a 10-20-year time frame. No matter how 
essential this improvement is, it is insignificant compared to 
the tax changes. Incentives to start a lengthy R&amp;D project to 
improve a process by some percentage point, while the rules may 
suddenly alter the cost by perhaps 10-20 percent, will be 
extremely limited. Instead, the businessman is likely to 
perceive that resources should be concentrated either to getting 
the decision pointed in a direction which favors his own 
interests, or not to do anything at all, while waiting and 
hoping for the situation to be clarified. 
  As was mentioned earlier, the interest level is of crucial 
importance for the profitability of the energy project, and thus 
for the opportunities for bringing about technical development. 
This applies especially to development of capital-intensive 
systems. The development under way in EEA/EC agreements has 
already resulted in an equalization of the interest level in 
various countries, a tendency which can be expected to continue. 
The interest level can thus not be influenced nationally as much 
as before, but in a small country such as Sweden it is primarily 
internationally determined and only slightly affected by the 
general economic climate. 
<H5>  4.2 Motives and Means of Innovation Support </H5>
[.sup]6[/] 
  Society's interest in the development of energy technology, 
just as in all other technical development, is, of course, to 
see to it that technical development progresses with good speed 
and that it gets an orientation which coincides with the general 
good. Doing so potentially involves three different types of 
influence: 


    -  Accelerating technical development 
  -  limiting the use of technology with consequences negative for 
society 
  -  guiding technical development toward the direction desirable 
for society. 

    In most areas of technology, society's interest has mainly 
involved the first aspect. In areas of technology where the 
activity has potentially negative consequences for people and 
environment, which concerns many types of processing industries 
including energy, society also has an interest in reducing or 
completely eliminating the use of certain types of technology. 
In the field of energy, the third type of influence has also 
been of significance, for example in the form of society's 
selectively having tried to stimulate certain technology such as 
wind power, bioenergy, etc. 
  It is not obvious that society needs to take any 
responsibility for technology development by businesses. In a 
functioning market, the technology needed will be produced and 
is economically defensible. The fundamental reason why society 
really has to stimulate technical development is therefore that 
there are said to be "market failures," which makes the motive 
for technical development by private organizations too weak from 
a socioeconomic aspect. Below, we list four arguments which have 
been brought up as to why this should be the case. 
  1. "R&amp;D results are of a collective nature, which is 
why the 
social benefits are greater than that of the individual company. 
Thus, projects exist which should be undertaken from a 
socioeconomic aspect, but which have no business-economic 
profitability and should therefore not be undertaken without 
subsidies." 
  2. "Companies and financiers avoid particularly risky 
activities if they can. It is usually said that they have a high 
aversion to risk. Since R&amp;D projects often carry unusually 
high 
risk, this results in few R&amp;D projects being started. This 
risk 
profile of technical development projects further causes the 
capital market to be unwilling to provide resources for this 
type of project. If it does, it is on particularly unfavorable 
terms." 
  3. "The costs of developing and, above all, investing in new 
technology of an infrastructure character are often of such 
extent that the capital market cannot cope with such large 
projects. If it does manage it, the terms will be particularly 
unfavorable, so the government must help." 
  4. "The assessment by the market of the usefulness and costs 
of technology can differ from that of society, for example by 
not fully including the environmental hazards from various types 
of technology in the companies' financial evaluation. Technology 
of major benefit to society must therefore be stimulated so that 
it becomes competitive." 
  These are thus fundamental reasons and, as is shown in 
sections 4.4 and 4.5, there is no lack of arguments against 
several of the reasons given above. 
  Means of Supporting Innovation 
  In principle there are three basic methods to formulate the 
means of controlling innovation: 


    -  Regulation 
  -  financial means of control 
  -  education and information 

    Regulation has traditionally been society's most important 
method for limiting negative environmental effects[.sup]7[/] 
in the energy sector. 
  The financial means of control can be of many kinds and 
include "carrots" (subsidies) and "whips" (fees) for 
development. Various categories of financial means of control 
are shown below. 
  Figure 4.1. Financial Means of Control in the Innovation 
Field 


    -  Subsidies (see below) 
  -  Taxes and fees 
  -  Government purchasing of technology 
  -  R&amp;D carried out or purchased by the state Source: 
According to 
Folster (1991) 

    Subsidies, in turn, can be provided in a number of different 
ways, according to the table below. 
  Figure 4.2. Innovation-Supporting Subsidies 


    -  General subsidies 
  -  R&amp;D tax deductions 
  -  General support for R&amp;D in specific industries 



      -  Selective Subsidies 
  -  Direct project grants 
  -  Subsidized loans 
  -  Loans with favorable terms 
  -  Loan guarantees 
  -  Honors Source: According to Folster (1991) 

    In order to accelerate the development, direct project 
grants 
to the energy field has been the principal method, while taxes 
and fees have obviously been the method for reducing the 
negative effects of technology application.[.sup]8[/] 
  Education and information are a third type of 
control.[.sup]9[/] By providing information about what is 
possible and how to go about it, a response is expected from the 
users. In general, information has not been used as much as a 
means of controlling innovation as the other two methods. That 
is because it is not known in advance to the same extent what 
the result of this type of measure will be. From this 
perspective, regulations are the most appealing, of course. 
<H3>  4.3 Experience of Swedish and Foreign Support for Energy 
Innovations </H3>
  In this section certain observations are made regarding the 
effects of supporting innovation. The material is based on both 
Swedish and foreign experiences, with a certain dominance for 
Swedish experiences. It is, of course, extremely difficult 
unambiguously to comment on the overall effects of a number of 
different measures. However, we outline a few principal 
directions regarding the experience. 
  The most successful role of Swedish society as a developer 
of 
new energy technology has been as owner of the former National 
Waterfall Agency, which, within the framework of the owner's 
political priorities, acted with integrity based on relevant 
technical and economic principles, and in this way greatly 
contributed to the development of energy technology in the 
country. Several of the most significant new products which 
originated in Sweden were developed for the needs of the 
Waterfall Agency. This has been a consequence of the 
enterprise's business activity and is therefore something 
different than government innovation support. It is thus not 
possible to draw any conclusions about the form of support which 
involves government technology purchasing based on the results 
achieved by the government's public service enterprises, a 
generalization which is sometimes done. 
  As for the innovation support, society's environmental 
regulations appear to be the most successful area. The measures 
have often led to the intended result. This is true in Sweden as 
well as abroad. In general, the support for innovation in order 
to guide the use of technology toward more environmentally 
friendly technology seems to be more or less without objection. 
However, in some cases application of these regulations has 
represented an obstacle to new technology. New technology always 
leads to certain breakin problems. The fact that in some cases 
temporary exemptions for emission regulations were not granted 
has caused the choice of more traditional solutions, which in 
the long run were probably poorer. 
  In several cases it is obvious that the financial support 
moved up the projects somewhat, which was not always good for 
the development process but led to the results having been 
forced out and immature products being presented to the market. 
  Among equipment manufacturers it is most striking how small 
the effect of the support has been for the companies' activity, 
and it is rarely that the support measures in themselves have 
initiated new projects. This relative disinterest should be 
viewed in the light of the R&amp;D function's strategic character 
for the long-term survival of the industrial enterprise. It is 
through the results for which the development function is 
responsible that survival is assured. The fact that the 
development costs are paid for is not enough of an incentive to 
put the company's best resources into development, but it 
requires a firm conviction that the projects will lead to 
products which in turn can generate a profit in a commercial 
market. 
  That does not always mean, however, that the companies are 
disinterested in support if such is available. Given that it has 
been decided to invest in a certain development, all 
opportunities for financing are welcome. This means that as long 
as economic support in various forms is given to companies, the 
companies will concentrate on obtaining these funds for projects 
which the company wants to undertake. The company will also, as 
long as it has a chance of getting the funds, stubbornly insist 
that the support is needed. 
  Among energy enterprises it has been more common that the 
opportunities for getting support have also affected the choice 
of which projects to carry out. This is probably because the 
development function is not the company's life blood in the same 
sense, and that covering the costs is therefore a stronger 
incentive. Another reason is that since support in various forms 
has been given for such a long time, the companies and their 
owners have in some cases "gotten used to" the fact that 
technical development is undertaken with partial government 
funding, and a lack of support means that the projects will not 
be undertaken. 
<H5>  4.4 The Principal Problems of Energy Innovation Support </H5>
  The following section deals with the problems which have 
emerged regarding financial innovation support, in particular, 
in which we also include subsidies such as taxation, aimed at 
prioritizing certain technology. These difficulties have 
primarily been of three kinds: social time frames, opportunities 
for successful project selection and the negative effects which 
can ensue from support. Experiences are based mainly on Swedish 
innovation support during the 1970's and 1980's. 
  The Project Selection 
  One reason for the problem with development support is that 
the government has had a difficult time making early, good 
assessments of development projects, which is why the very 
important project start rarely becomes very effective. The 
reasons for these problems are, in part, that it is complex to 
select the "right" projects to support, and partly that 
innovation programs must also take various political 
considerations, for example regional and energy-political ones, 
into account. 
  It is difficult to make a sensible choice of which 
technology 
to back. What is "a good project" signifies both that the 
project itself is promising and that it fits into the 
organization's overall strategy. It is thus difficult for an 
outsider to make these evaluations, even if he is professionally 
competent. 
  There are also reasons to assume that the selection will be 
"poorer" than would have been necessary, since an innovation 
support program is usually designed with regard for things other 
than finding "exactly the right" projects. Even if a political 
decision is right, there will soon be an election, which could 
mean that a new group with other priorities will come to power 
and that new projects will be given priority, before the old 
ones have "gotten there." Often, regional considerations are 
taken into account and other types of considerations, which in 
themselves could be justified, for example based on regional 
policy, but which could lead to certain other types of projects 
with less ability to compete being prioritized. 
  The Short Time Frames of Social Support 
  As was mentioned in Chapter 2, commercial technical 
development usually has a time frame of perhaps 10 years from 
idea to marketing. During this entire period the financial 
backers must, if needed, be prepared to come up with new 
resources in order to bring the project forward. Direct 
financial social support for the development of energy 
technology has been paid over an entirely different time scale, 
often encompassing no more than a three-year-period. A 
development project which stands and falls with the granting of 
a lot of support throughout the entire development period, is 
thus running a very large risk of failure. 
  The fact that funding is available for a normally limited 
period of time risks increasing the companies' shortsightedness 
and increase the market uncertainty. When support is given as a 
one-time contribution, for example in the form of an investment 
subsidy for a demonstration facility, it risks leading to an 
investment hump, followed by a drop when the support disappears. 
When the support is given in the form of running subsidies, the 
additional cost must be calculated over the relatively short 
period which the support can be assumed to span. During the 
1980's several companies made dubious investment decisions, in 
retrospect, as a result of not having anticipated that the 
regulations would change so quickly. Today, the enterprises have 
learned from this and in general practice greater caution in 
undertaking investments which depend on long-term contributions 
and subsidies for their profitability. 
  The awareness of the need for stable rules for industrial 
development has increased in society in recent years. To a 
certain extent this is a result of experiences in the field of 
energy technology in particular. The greater 
internationalization also has the result that more stability can 
be predicted for the future. At the same time, it must be 
concluded that there are hardly any chances of getting back to 
the stability which marked the development of the postwar 
period, because of an increasingly turbulent world. 
  Negative Effects of the Innovation Support 
  One motive for society's innovation support is also to 
influence the market-based incentives for development and 
application of technology. Of course, there are certain risks 
that the natural tendency toward innovation may be affected. In 
the energy field the following negative effects have been 
observed. 
  By "forcing" a development, for instance through a 
combination of development and introduction supports, one risks 
bringing a product to market which is actually not finished. 
This results in the early customers getting a negative view of 
the technology, which leads to a cool reception for mature 
products that have been further developed. 
  The most negative effect is of a psychological nature. The 
long-term subsidies have led to a not uncommon view among owners 
of energy companies that technical development should take place 
with society's support. This results in projects sometimes 
tending to be ranked according to wherever support is available, 
and that intrinsically promising projects are not followed up 
because no support can be obtained. 
<H3>  4.5 Is Continued Economic Support for Commercial Development 
of Technology Necessary? </H3>
  The motives for society to provide support for energy 
innovations have been of four different types, as was mentioned: 


    -  that R&amp;D is a collective product 
  -  that the companies have a high aversion to risk 
  -  that the capital market cannot cope with financing large 
projects, and 
  -  that negative environmental effects are not taken into 
consideration in the evaluation by the marketplace. 

    The Collective Nature of R&amp;D 
  On the average, R&amp;D projects undoubtedly provide a large 
amount of socioeconomic benefit. Within the energy sector, 
however, this is primarily due to a few projects which are very 
profitable both for the enterprise and for society. Few projects 
are not profitable from a business-economic point of view but 
should still be carried out from the aspect of society. In 
connection with the deregulation which is now under way in the 
energy markets, there is some risk that the great openness which 
has characterized the energy companies, with jointly owned 
development companies and projects, could decline somewhat. It 
is essential for the tradition of joint industrial projects and 
companies concerning research, education and evaluation of new 
technology to be able to continue, since these activities 
facilitate the spreading of knowledge within the industry, which 
ought possibly to be stimulated by a certain social support. 
  The Companies' Aversion to Risk 
  The companies within the energy sector have previously not 
generally avoided becoming involved in long-term development 
projects with technical and economic risks, if the potential 
gains from the development project were found to be sufficiently 
large. During the 1980's, tendencies toward a certain aversion 
to risk could be glimpsed. This is to some extent a result of 
the general economic development during the 1980's. But it is 
chiefly a result of the plentiful supply of government funding 
available for the "right" projects. Since the energy industry is 
marked by large, financially secure, companies, there are also 
no major financial difficulties in undertaking development 
projects. We thus looked only at the special need to support 
companies for energy technology development. To the extent 
general commercial subsidies are available, for instance in 
order to facilitate obtaining risk capital by small and 
medium-sized companies, energy companies should of course have 
the same opportunities as others. 
  The Capacity of the Capital Market 
  With the internationalized capital market, the financing of 
new energy technology infrastructures at reasonable cost is 
managed without direct government help. A reason for the 
government to support this can only occur as a result of rapid 
abolition of nuclear power. This could conceivably lead to a new 
wave of investments, which would have enormous consequences for 
the electric power market, unless a part of the financing is 
passed onto society. 
  External Market Factors 
  Reducing environmental effects by means of internalizing 
environmental costs will continue to be an important field for 
society, preferably in international cooperation. It should be 
noted in this connection that in the majority of cases 
regulations are the method which has been used for successful 
contributions, despite the fact that fees are regarded as 
preferable from a strictly economic aspect. This is because it 
is much easier to "know what you get" with a regulation, and 
that a regulation can be a clearer signal to the market about 
what is needed. Environmental fees have often turned out to be a 
blunt instrument. A contributing cause for this is that it can 
be easy to confuse fees as a means of stimulating technology 
development with the fiscal nature of fees. In principle, IVA is 
not opposed to economic means of control if handled correctly, 
that is to say as a means of control and not as a means of 
taxation, and if the field is suitable for this type of control. 
<H3>  5. Recommendations Regarding Society's Role in Commercial 
Development of Energy Technology </H3>
  In Chapter 2 the success factors for technical development 
projects were analyzed and the extent to which the energy field 
differs in this respect from other fields of technology. Chapter 
3 dealt with development patterns for technical development in 
the energy sector, and Chapter 4 analyzed society's means of 
influencing the companies' technical development, as well as 
Swedish and foreign experiences of the measures employed. 
  Society's most important task, in order to facilitate the 
development of energy technology, is to create an industrial and 
innovation climate which leads to good profitability development 
in the businesses and thus to investments in industrial activity 
being more profitable than investments in property, for example. 
  One condition for a well-functioning business community is a 
functioning research system, which is capable of supplying 
business and industry with new knowledge and new carriers of 
knowledge. This requires high-quality research at universities 
and academic institutions in fields of technology relevant to 
business and industry. In order to assure this relevance, 
expanded cooperation between business and academic institution 
is needed. This concerns above all the opportunities for 
universities and academic institutions to obtain stimuli and 
signals from business and industry regarding essential research 
fields. Within the framework for this, there should be much 
greater academic freedom regarding the research field. 
  A the same time society should bear primary responsibility 
for financing basic research and education. In today's situation 
society takes too little responsibility for this in some areas 
which are of major importance for the energy sector. In some 
cases the result was that industry had to come in and help 
finance such activity, for example regarding the Electric Power 
Center at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). In other 
cases, altogether too little activity is being carried out, for 
example in reactor technology. Simultaneously, the energy 
industry is facing major changes from having been a national 
industry with service character to greatly increased 
internationalization. Because we are a small country, it is 
particularly important that we are capable of participating in 
the international cooperation and exchange of experience. It is 
therefore essential for academic research to be given greater 
ability to exchange experiences and time for adjustment to the 
R&amp;D programs which exist within the EC, above all. 
  Society should therefore increase its funding of direct 
academic research within consumer-specific fields, help expand 
the contact surfaces between academic institutions and the 
business community, and create more resources for participating 
in international programs. One should also strive for more 
international exchanges and active participation in planning and 
undertaking international research cooperations, in order to 
increase international influence on Swedish energy research. 
  The energy sector has been characterized by major 
uncertainty 
during the 1970's and 1980's. This is in part a result of market 
fluctuations, in part a result of major turbulence regarding the 
fiscal and fee policy as well as regarding the future of nuclear 
power. Energy taxes are of fundamental importance for the 
profitability of investments. In the future, regulatory and fee 
systems must be designed in a more consistent, more credible and 
more durable way, so that preconditions are created for a stable 
market and, consequently, opportunities for the companies to 
develop and invest in new, more efficient and, for the 
environment, more acceptable products and systems. 
  Within the energy sector society not only has an interest in 
technical development proceeding rapidly, but also in the 
application of technology being shifted over toward technology 
which has minor, or preferably no, impact on the environment. In 
remarkably many instances the market forces have been able to 
produce this greater environmental adaptation. One example is 
the development of technology for bleaching cellulose. Society 
has a self-evident responsibility to monitor that this is the 
case, and, where that does not happen, society's largely 
successful work in the environmental sector must go on. 
  However, measures in this area must to an increasing degree 
be announced in advance or at least be foreseeable with a 
certain priority, since the measures could otherwise lead to 
reduced willingness to take risks. There must also be a certain 
flexibility in the regulations, so that during the introductory 
period there is some margin in the event the new technology 
cannot cope with the imposed standards. If not, the rules risk 
having a technology-preserving effect. To the extent economic 
means of control are used, they must be used as a means of 
improving the environment, for example, and not as a way to 
augment government revenue. Furthermore, economic means of 
control must not be used in combination with regulation, since 
they will then automatically get this fiscal character and not 
be technology-promoting. Measures should naturally be undertaken 
in such a manner and at such a pace that the opportunities for 
carrying out industrial activity in Sweden is not adversely 
affected. Measures should be undertaken in international 
cooperation or at least in coordination with the international 
development. 
  Other than means of control intended to internalize 
environmental costs, we believe that if the innovation climate 
for energy technology can be reinforced with the measures 
mentioned above there is no need for direct financial support 
for the development of energy technology directed toward 
individual companies or smaller groups of companies. New 
technology will mainly enter the energy system in connection 
with new investments. During the 1990's the need for new 
investments in the Swedish energy system appears to be of 
limited extent. The opportunities for broad distribution of new 
technology in Sweden in the short term is extremely limited, and 
contributions aimed at a rapid breakthrough of new supply 
technology will scarcely be successful. 
  Subsidies are also not the solution for supporting the 
technical development in the developmentally "weak" industries. 
A considerable portion of the subsidies have, particularly as 
regards multifamily dwellings and premises, been a poorly 
functioning market. Deregulation and increased competition can 
be expected to result in these markets functioning better in the 
future. This is indicated by the positive development involving 
energy management in small houses, a market which has worked 
much better as a result of tough competition and less extensive 
subsidies. 
  The situation among municipal energy plants is more 
difficult. The industry is developmentally weak, primarily as a 
result of its weak owners, who did not permit the companies to 
allocate resources for new technical development projects. The 
tendency has been reinforced by the ample support which has been 
given to this sector, since it permitted the strategy mentioned 
above. It is possible to speak of the development support having 
functioned as some sort of "drug" for the companies. If the 
support were not available it would be more obvious to owners 
that they have to make decisions to invest in technical 
development, and the incentives for development would thus be 
increased. 
  This negative view of the effectiveness of financial support 
also includes government purchasing of technology. To be sure, 
there are examples that the ongoing technology purchasing 
program has contributed to several successful development 
projects. IVA's assessment is, however, that these development 
processes would have come about anyway. Therefore, the program 
has instead been successful in catching on early to a 
development already established by the market, rather than 
establishing new development processes. It is also remarkable 
that in the area of making energy more efficient there have been 
several parallel activities initiated by various players, both 
government and private, something which may be questioned. 
  In sum, the conclusion of this reasoning is that direct 
government efforts directed toward supporting the companies' 
development of new energy technology will not be of decisive 
importance for the development of future energy 
technology.[.sup]10[/]. This applies to both support for new 
supply technology and new application technology. The more 
extensive subsidies for this orientation given at present are 
the Energy Technology Fund, the Experimental Construction 
Support and the Technology Purchasing Support for more efficient 
energy technology. We propose a cancellation of these subsidies. 
The Energy Technology Fund and the Technology Purchasing Program 
each have a budget of about 150-200 million kronor a year up to 
1996, and the Experimental Construction Program about 10 million 
a year. 
  In connection with the increased market orientation and 
internationalization which the energy industry is undergoing, it 
is particularly important to retain the valuable Swedish 
tradition of extensive cooperation within the energy industry. 
Joint research by a specific industry is an important method for 
this. It is reasonable that some of the funds released above 
should be shifted to stimulating these jointly owned development 
projects and development companies. It is essential for this 
activity to be managed under its own responsibility. With a view 
to the greater internationalization and the need for greater 
international influences within the sector, it would be 
especially desirable if society could also contribute to joint 
industrial research in which international players are 
participating and thus be able to share the results. 
Strengthening joint research in an industry need not mean 
establishing new institutes, which risk becoming rigid and in 
the long term less flexible, a problem often indicated for 
certain joint industrial research. The activity should therefore 
mainly be conducted by the member companies.

<H5>  1. Introduction and Summary </H5>
  The following represented the foundation material for a 
discussion meeting at IVA on 5 December 1991 on mechanisms for 
successful commercial technical development in the energy 
sector. The foundation material consists of seven case 
descriptions of technical development projects. The cases were 
chosen partly to illuminate development projects of major 
significance for Swedish industry, partly to illustrate various 
particularly important, critical factors in connection with 
commercial technology development. 
  The main question which is to be illustrated is what 
determines the direction and speed of technical development. The 
main issue can be divided into the following questions: 


    -  Where do ideas for new products and processes come from? 
  -  When does an idea become a major project? 
  -  What determines the resources and requirements allocated to a 
project? 
  -  What determines the buyer's choice of technology? 
  -  Why is spreading new technology time-consuming? 

    The following cases are described: 


    -  High-voltage direct current transmission, HVDC 
  -  Thermo-mechanical pulp production, TMP 
  -  Casting technology 
  -  Pressurized fluidized bed combustion of coal, PFBC 
  -  The Stirling engine 
  -  Fiberoptic technology 
  -  Mobile telephones 

    The HVDC case illustrates, among other things, the need for 
mutually trustful cooperation between seller and buyer of 
technology. The case also shows that successful 
commercialization of new technology, particularly the kind 
connected with very large investments, is also a result of 
"successful circumstances" which can be more or less influenced, 
in this case a reference facility of "suitable" size. 
  The TMP case shows, among other things, the effect of 
cooperation between research and industry in order achieve a 
joint goal. The project also demonstrates the complicated 
interplay when energy aspects are only one of a number of 
different considerations which are involved in a decision to 
invest in new process technology, but that new energy technology 
in a considerable way can further reinforce the breakthrough of 
the new technology in the market. 
  The "casting technology" case demonstrates that even mature 
industries can undergo rapid technical change when a number of 
different factors are present at the same time. The case also 
shows that such changes are often connected with major new 
investments and thus cannot be viewed independently from 
investment cycles. 
  The PFBC case stresses, among other things, the long run-in 
for many technical development projects, that several different 
interested parties can be present in a development project and 
how the direction of a large and complicated project can change 
over the course of the development process. 
  The Stirling engine case demonstrates how important and 
difficult the market evaluation for new technology is. 
Technology can be generally applicable while only being 
competitive within a narrow segment. Which these segments are 
can also change relatively rapidly. 
  Two of the cases, fiberoptic technology and mobile 
telephones, lie outside the energy sector, in order to provide 
an opportunity to compare the technical development processes in 
various fields of technology. These two technologies belong to a 
field which is normally regarded as less "mature," at the same 
time as it still involves technology of an infrastructure 
nature, which is why the differences are not judged to be as 
large and comparisons therefore become meaningful. 
  In principle, technical development projects can be 
classified at three different levels, and it is important to 
make this distinction clear: 
  1. Rationalizations 
  Rationalizations mean minor changes of an existing product. 
This type of product is often very important for raising the 
performance of a product or reducing its manufacturing cost. 
These projects are normally connected with small technical and 
commercial risks. 
  2. New Industrial Development 
  By this is meant projects of considerable size, aimed at 
developing a product based on new technology or fulfilling an 
entirely new market demand. This type of project is usually 
linked with extensive technical and commercial risks. 
  3. National Power Drive 
  This type of project, which is common in the defense sector, 
means that no individual group of commercial players is able to 
cope with the task as a result of its technical complexity and 
risks and because of the major economic efforts that are 
required. Instead, this type of project demands extensive 
government guarantees, and perhaps government founding of new 
organs such as new research institutions, in order to be carried 
out. This also applies if the greater part of the development 
work is carried out within the business sector. 
  These seven cases may chiefly be said to belong to the 
second 
category of projects, new industrial development projects. 
<H5>  2. Power Transmission With High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) </H5>
  The idea of using direct current for long power 
transmissions 
existed as early as the 1800s, in the infancy of electrical 
engineering. There are advantages of direct current systems for 
use with long power lines. 
  At the end of the 1800's the three-phase system arrived, in 
which Jonas Wenstrom, who founded ASEA, was one of the pioneers. 
The advantage with alternating current was that it was possible 
to raise the voltage and thus expand the distribution area. The 
first major power transmissions with alternating current in 
Sweden were introduced in the early 1900's and were at 30 to 50 
kV. 
  In the 1910's Vattenfall began to pose demands on the 
Swedish 
market for higher voltages and larger transformers, such as for 
the first 130-Kv Trollhattan-Vasteras-Alvkarleby trunk line. In 
the mid-1920's ASEA had also succeeded in its effort to raise 
transformer manufacture to an internationally competitive level. 
  In the 1920's the eyes once again turned toward high-voltage 
direct current transmission at ASEA. If the big problems around 
direct and alternating high-voltage current were to be solved, 
direct-current systems could become cheaper for large power 
transmissions over long distances and long-distance transmission 
under water could also be possible. 
  A quarter of a century of laborious technical development 
work was initiated at ASEA, with Vattenfall as a patient 
customer willing to assume the risk. 
  At ASEA Uno Lamm was given the task of beginning to study 
current direction principles and rectifier elements at the end 
of the 1920's. Both at ASEA and internationally the effort 
centered on a gas-filled rectifier with an arc burning in 
mercury vapor, with properties for letting the current flow in 
only one direction. Uno Lamm and his coworkers tested gas-filled 
rectifiers at low voltages, but thought they saw the principles 
for how to increase the voltages. 
  Each year Uno Lamm got new funds for continued development 
of 
the ideas from ASEA' management. There were no fat budgets for 
the project and it was difficult to make a profitability 
calculation. Nevertheless, Uno Lamm got new money each year. 
  During the 1920's and 1930's Vattenfall was in a very 
expansive phase. The total electricity consumption in Sweden 
doubled every 10 years. Between 1923 and 1955 the use of 
electric power in industry increased about 7.5 times, within the 
transportation sector more than 20 times and in retail 
consumption 18 times. At Vattenfall, mainly represented by the 
technical manager Waldemar Borgquist, later director general, 
one realized that high-voltage direct current transmission would 
offer advantages for the Swedish electric power grid, in which 
the principal energy resources in the form of hydroelectric 
power resources were found in the thinly populated northern 
parts, while the center of consumption lay in the southern parts 
of the country. Large quantities of energy would soon need to be 
transported across approximately 1,000 kilometers. The cost of 
the power line in a high-voltage direct current system is lower 
than in a conventional alternating current system. The costs for 
end stations is higher for direct current, however. In order to 
offer an economically competitive alternative, the transmission 
distances must therefore be long for the direct current 
alternative, which what was also the case in the country. 
  Borgquist's strongly expressed interest in an introduction 
of 
high-voltage direct current is likely to have contributed to 
ASEA's decision to continue to expand the long-range and costly 
development work, which included a large proportion of basic 
physical and electrical research and development. 
  The contacts between Uno Lamm and Waldemar Borgquist go back 
to the end of the 1930's and their relationship was good. In 
1943 ASEA and Vattenfall agreed on a test facility for 
high-voltage direct current. In Trollhattan a so-called ion 
valve laboratory was built, where ASEA constructed, manufactured 
and delivered experimental rectifiers with associated equipment 
and measurement devices. Vattenfall also made available a 55-Kv 
line between Trollhattan and Mellerud. Tests continued for 
several years, up to the early 1960's. Since the physical and 
electrical principles for a rectifier could not entirely be 
mathematically described, the testing of various constructions 
was of decisive importance. Long-term testing under realistic 
conditions also provided experience with the wear of the 
rectifiers. Studies of the power line between the conversion 
stations were undertaken. 
  In the 1940's Vattenfall resumed projections for Harspranget 
which had been initiated during the 1910's. The original 
intention was to use high-voltage direct current for 
transmission of energy from Harspranget to Hallsberg. Waldemar 
Borgquist was passionate about it. At ASEA one was more unsure. 
The project was too big to dare invest in the technology, since 
the voltages were high. Tests carried out at Vattenfall showed 
that the direct current alternative was a passable route, but 
too risk-filled. 
  Since the power production from Harspranget would be of 
crucial importance for the total power production in the 
country, one did not dare take the step. It was necessary for 
Harspranget not to be delayed. Harspranget was readied for 
direct current, however; the generators, for example, were 
prepared for alternative use of both alternating and direct 
current. 
  For Harspranget a 400-Kv alternating current transmission 
was 
chosen, the highest voltage at that time for long distances. 
Even this solution was risk-filled, to be sure. Harspranget was 
put into operation in 1951. 
  In 1950 the Riksdag decided to use high-voltage direct 
current transmission for an underwater cable between the 
mainland and Gotland. Waldemar Borgquist personally had a major 
part in the decision. On Gotland electric power was generated by 
small diesel turbines and steam turbines. Electric power 
production on Gotland was twice as expensive as hydroelectric 
power. Transmitting power from the mainland was a way to lower 
the cost of power for Gotland. The state contributed with 
investment and projection costs for the transmission links. 
  The project was ideal for ASEA, since it was of a relatively 
modest size. ASEA would be able manage without major problems 
even if the project failed; all the problems had not been solved 
at that time, but the opportunities for solving them within the 
delivery period were judged favorable. Gotland would also not be 
without electricity, since some power production existed on the 
island. 
  Operation began in 1954 and, after some initial problems, 
Vattenfall was able to take over the facility before the end of 
the test operation period written in the contract. The world's 
first HVDC link (High Voltage Direct Current) had been 
installed. Its length was 100 kilometers and it carried 20 MW at 
100 Kv. 
  The costs for Gotland's power subscribers were 
simultaneously 
cut in half. 
  The Gotland link provided evidence that the technology was 
feasible. Further, it was an important demonstration facility, 
which in the long term would make a commercial breakthrough 
possible. 
  After the project, however, ASEA demobilized large parts of 
the project group. 
  The system had been under development for about 25 years. 
Among other things, 140 different variants of gas rectifiers had 
been tested. The system technology, combination of tubes and 
more conventional components for entire static converters must 
be stressed as advanced new design. 
  During the spring of 1957 the British Central Electricity 
Generating Board and the French Electricite de France ordered 
tubes, control equipment, etc. from ASEA for an HVDC 
transmission across the English Channel. The power was 160 MW at 
200 kV. ASEA took responsibility for the technical coordination. 
The facility began operation in 1961. 
  During 1965 other HVDC links were put into operation: New 
Zealand, Japan and between Sweden and Denmark. The commercial 
breakthrough had occurred. 
  ASEA had become a world leader in this technology. Licenses 
were sold to manufacturers in both Great Britain and the United 
States. 
  In 1959 ASEA signed a licensing agreement with U.S. General 
Electric, which provided patent rights regarding semiconductors 
and thyristors. However, ASEA's goal was quickly to disengage 
from the licensing agreement, at which it also succeeded by 
means of a major internal development effort. 
  When the thyristors came, people at ASEA were relatively 
doubtful of the thyristor technology for HVDC and they did not 
believe that the technology would break through as quickly as 
some other competitors. ASEA did not dare do anything other than 
invest in thyristors for HVDC, however. 
  In 1965 ASEA began the construction and calculation 
principles for HVDC equipped with thyristors. The development 
was headed by Gunnar Engstrom. Vattenfall was a partner in this 
development phase as well. The goal of the project was to have a 
test rectifier in operation within two years in the Gotland 
transmission. Experiences from this project lead to the first 
commercial thyristor rectifiers for HVDC being installed in 
1970, when the Gotland transmission was supplemented by a full 
set of rectifiers and the voltage raised to 150 kV and the 
transmitted power to 30 MW. 
  At the end of the 1960's ASEA was forced for political 
reasons to withdraw from the Cabora Bassa project in Mozambique, 
where ASEA had offered an gas rectifier solution. The order went 
to the AEG, BBC and Siemens consortium, which offered a 
thyristor alternative. The competitors therefore obtained a 
valuable reference object for their thyristor technology: 
  ASEA, which worked with both technologies, could see that 
the 
thyristor alternative gradually strengthened its competitive 
ability. In 1971 the decision was made to close down all 
development of gas-filled rectifiers and concentrate on the 
thyristor alternative. 
  ASEA has created and retained a leading position in the 
world 
even with the thyristor alternative. One example of a large and 
important order was Itaipu in Brazil, 1983-85, where the 
transmission power is 6,300 MW over a distance of 900 kilometers. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  The theoretical and economic advantages of high-voltage 
direct current transmission for certain types of transmission 
were known early on. One therefore had a goal, but in some 
periods it appeared distant. 
  In the early part of the development ASEA's management 
showed 
great determination and daring by its support for such a 
long-range and economically risky project. In certain parts the 
results obtained were not regarded as passable routes for future 
commercialization. 
  A financier/customer willing to take risks appeared at one 
point, Vattenfall, which also turned out to be long-lasting. No 
immediate results were demanded. They also saw the long-range 
economy of the HVDC solution. The extensive technical 
development primarily of gas-filled rectifiers required full- 
scale tests over long periods. 
  The relationship between seller and customer was 
long-lasting 
and very good. Individual persons must also be pointed out, 
although many persons and large organizations were involved. 
Waldemar Borgquist represents the technically competent 
customer/financier, willing to take risks, and Uno Lamm the 
indefatigable technician. 
  A potential reference project emerges (Harspranget). One 
believes in an HVDC solution, at least in the future, but the 
risks are deemed too great. Economic risks, but also a third 
partner, the country's power consumers, would have been affected 
in the event of failure. A short time afterwards a more 
appealing alternative was presented; a project of just the right 
size (the Gotland link). Certainly, a failure would have been 
felt from a purely financial point of view, but that would have 
been manageable. The third partner, the power consumers on 
Gotland, would also not have been affected, since power 
generation already existed on the island. 
  The reference project then provided a lead which could not 
be 
bridged by the competitors. Final commercialization did not 
occur until 10 years later, however. 
  A number of factors were required for cooperation, in which 
the various steps took place in the right order, in order for 
commercialization to become a fact. 
<H3>  3. Thermo-Mechanical Pulp and Energy Recovery in 
Thermo-Mechanical Pulp Production </H3>
  Wood consists basically of two different components. 
Cellulose and other carbohydrates, which are the essential 
components of the fiber, and lignin, which keeps the fiber 
together. In order to make paper, the fiber must be separated 
out. In principle, there are two different ways to create this 
separation, chemical or mechanical. 
  In a chemical pulp process the fiber is separated by 
dissolving the lignin by boiling in a boiling fluid consisting 
of a sulfate solution, the sulfate method, or of a sulfite 
solution, the sulfite method. Since the lignin represents a 
large part of the wood substance and this is dissolved together 
with a large part of the soluble carbohydrates, the pulp yield 
is only 45 percent for sulfate pulp and 55 percent for sulfite 
pulp, compared to 95 percent for mechanical pulps. In mechanical 
pulp production the fibers of the wood are released by using 
mechanical force to tear the components apart. In this procedure 
the lignin fragments remain on the fibers, which explains the 
considerably higher pulp yield. The fibers of the wood are 
released by grinding with a stone, stone groundwood (SGW), or by 
"milling" (refining) of wood chips between grinding disks, 
refiner mechanical pulp (RMP). 
  Chemical and mechanical pulp have widely different 
properties. The chemical pulp has great strength, because the 
fibers are relatively undamaged, and is therefore used for those 
types of paper where this is essential, for example in packaging 
paper. Chemical pulp is also very suitable for bleaching, which 
is why this type of pulp is also used for various types of fine 
paper. It also ages relatively well as regard light sensitivity 
and fragility. 
  Mechanical pulp, which is much cheaper to manufacture than 
chemical pulp, is weaker but provides a good foundation for 
printing. Paper from mechanical pulp also has a very low 
permeability for light, it is opaque, which is why the paper can 
be made thin and printed on both sides without it showing 
through. Mechanical pulp ages very quickly, however. As a result 
of the lower cost and the good printing properties, mechanical 
pulp is the only one used for newsprint production. Mechanical 
pulp is also an important component in cardboard and sanitary 
paper. 
  The grinding method was completely predominant until the 
early 1960s, when chip refining began to be used. The grinding 
method requires dry wood, in the Nordic countries in the form of 
spruce, of not too small dimensions. Refiners were able to use 
chips and therefore had greater freedom in selecting their 
assortment of wood. The development from stone groundwood to 
refiner mechanical pulp was a result of an abundance of saw mill 
chips in the majority of timber-producing nations, primarily in 
Canada. In order to utilize this surplus, it was desirable for 
the chips not just to be used for chemical pulp, but also for 
production of mechanical pulp. The principle involved pumping 
the wood chips through the refiner. In this way mechanical pulp 
of relatively low quality was obtained. With this process the 
fiber was damaged just as much as in the stone groundwood 
process. In addition, the pulp got darker and often more impure. 
  When releasing the fiber mechanically the fiber is more or 
less damaged, which is why the bond between the fibers is weaker 
than in chemical pulp. In order for the paper web to stay 
together on the machine and in the printing presses, it must be 
reinforced with chemical pulp. Previously, sulfite pulp was 
usually employed for this purpose. A common ratio for newsprint 
production was 75 percent groundwood and 25 percent sulfite 
pulp. Many newsprint mills thus had both a pulp grinding mill 
and a sulfite factory. 
  In paper manufacture there is a natural balance between 
increased strength on the one hand, in order to increase the 
speed of the paper machine and printing presses, which requires 
a higher proportion of chemical pulp, and the printing quality, 
which is improved by a high admixture of mechanical pulp. Since 
the birth of the industry, the width and speed of the paper 
machines have constantly increased, as shown in the table below 
[not included]. 
  At the North American mills, often using a poorer mechanical 
pulp than in the Nordic countries, the development led to such 
width and speed for the paper machine that the necessary 
admixture of chemical pulp increased considerably. In addition 
to higher costs, this larger proportion led to the printing 
quality becoming too poor. In many factories one therefore 
switched to the use of semi-bleached sulfate pulp, which was a 
stronger pulp than the sulfite pulp and which made it possible 
to reduce the admixture. But the sulfate pulp was even more 
expensive. 
  A supplementary reason for this transition was the difficult 
environmental problems which the sulfite factories often had, 
which resulted in demands that they be remodeled or closed. 
  At the same time there were wishes from the printing 
factories for better printing properties, as a result, for 
instance, of the introduction of four-color printing into the 
market. The paper producers therefore to some extent competed to 
offer as good a foundation for printing as possible. 
  Defibrator was founded by Arne Asplund partly to exploit his 
method for producing wood fiber boards by treating wood chips 
with steam at 170-190C and refining the chips in a 
defibrator at the same temperature under pressure. The coarse 
wood pulp was formed into boards. The apparatus became known as 
the Defibrator Boiler. 
  In the mid-1960's Asplund and the development engineers at 
Defibrator found that the Defibrator boiler could be used to 
modify the RMP process, so that the steam that formed during the 
chip refining could flow backward through the Defibrator boiler 
against the stream of chips being fed to the refiner. This made 
the lignin in the wood more plastic. The refining then became 
gentler, which resulted in a stronger pulp despite the 
considerably higher electric power consumption in comparison 
with to the groundwood process. Similar development work was 
under way more or less in parallel in several places, in North 
America, Sweden and in Finland. 
  Asplund succeeded in interesting Rockhammars Bruk in 
installing a large facility, which began operation in 1968. 
Rockhammars foremost reason for this cooperation was that it was 
looking for a niche for its plant. There was no future in being 
a mechanical pulp factory in the old-fashioned way. The pulp was 
sold in the market in competition with SGW and RMP. 
  The good properties of the pulp caused Holmens Bruk to 
install a large facility at Hallstavik in 1973. A strongly 
driving force behind this development was Einar Klinga, then 
technical director at Holmen. Tests of a newly built paper 
machine in Hallstavik showed that the pulp, which was called 
thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP), was of high quality. The first 
mill to be based completely on TMP was Braviken in 1977. 
  The competitor Bauer-Sunds modified its RMP method according 
to similar principles, but for several years Defibrator had a 
lead, principally because there were mechanical difficulties 
with the double-disc refiners. Several Bauer-Sunds facilities 
were installed, at SCA's paper mill Ortviken, for example. 
  Both Defibrator[.sup]11[/] and Sunds conducted intensive 
development work in order to produce TMP for paper qualities 
other than newsprint. Both parties found, however, that there 
was a lack of more basic research involving thermo-mechanical 
pulp. 
  The industry's research institute, STFI, in 1974 devoted 
itself to undertaking a broadly based research and development 
project which was called the T-pulp project. Participants in 
this were, in addition to STFI's and KTH's researchers, both 
Defibrator and Sunds, together with leading technicians from the 
Forest Industry. The project's final report was submitted in 
1977. 
  The project included, among others, full-scale tests 
undertaken at Hallstavik, Ortviken and Kvarnsveden. By 
connection to the system (reutilization of water), water 
consumption and emissions were reduced. The internal environment 
was radically improved by the disappearance of the steam 
emissions. One also studied modifications in which chemicals 
were added to the refining, so-called chemi-thermo-mechanical 
pulps (CTMP), which would gradually acquire major importance for 
sanitary papers and cardboard. 
  With the T-pulp projects a TMP knowledge base was developed, 
and the knowledge spread very rapidly within the industry. A 
large number of new plants were built at the paper mills as 
replacements for the grinding mills. 
  Mechanical pulp production is extremely power-intensive. 
Stone groundwood for newsprint requires 1,500-1,700 Kwh per ton 
of pulp and TMP about 2,500 kWh for Nordic spruce, which is a 
particularly suitable raw material for this purpose, 1,500-1,700 
kWh of which are for refining. In addition, steam is needed for 
drying the paper. 
  An obvious next step in the development was therefore a 
radical energy saving. In TMP refining a large amount of 
secondary heat is generated in the form of water vapor with low 
pressure. As long as the refining takes place under atmospheric 
pressure, the steam can only be used for heating hot water, or, 
alternatively, it must be compressed with a compressor. Both of 
these methods were tried. At the Braviken plant the hot water 
and the steam with atmospheric pressure were reserved, and at 
Hallstavik heat pumps were installed. 
  As an alternate method one had tried to put the whole 
process 
under pressure, the result of which would be that with the help 
of a pressure cyclone it would be possible to extract the steam 
under such pressure that it could be used as replacement for 
fresh steam in the drying portion of the paper machine. 
  The work with this process went on simultaneously in several 
different places. The first supplier who showed that this 
pressurized process functioned in a satisfactory way was 
Jylhavaara, which at its own mill in Jansenkoski operated a 
pilot facility where steam under three bars of pressure was 
extracted and at the same time a good TMP pulp was produced. It 
was also the first to offer such equipment on the market. The 
breakthrough into the market for this technology took place in 
approximately 1979-1980. Other equipment suppliers rapidly 
followed. The measure achieved a very rapid breakthrough and 
resulted in a dramatic reduction in the fuel requirements for 
drying paper pulp. 
  Today the technology is well developed and practiced at all 
mills of any significance. Up to 70 percent of the electrical 
energy added during refining is recycled and replaces new steam 
during paper drying which would otherwise have been generated 
with a suitable fuel. 
  Since the TMP pulp is considerably stronger than the 
groundwood, it is possible to make do with a considerably lower 
admixture of chemical pulp. Accordingly, today's "standard 
newsprint" (46 g/[.sup]2[/]) is run without any kind of 
chemical pulp for reinforcement, at speeds of 1,400 meters/min. 
Here, the TMP process has had enormous importance economically 
and from the aspect of energy, while the printing properties 
have also improved considerably. The work environment aspect is 
also an important advantage with this technology, since the 
grinding method required manual monitoring of the grinding 
equipment. 
  At a newsprint mill with TMP as its only pulp, it is 
possible 
in today's situation to meet nearly the entire need for heat by 
burning the bark and by using the steam as above. The amount of 
additional fuel is almost negligible, possibly about 10 percent. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  Over approximately a decade, the forest industry replaced 
centuries-old technology with a new one, TMP, which involved 
radical changes of technology, product quality, manufacturing 
economy, working environment and energy use.[.sup]12[/] 
  The case shows that technology sometimes takes a leap in 
development and that afterwards a continuous "maturity process" 
takes place, which cures the problems caused by the leap in 
technology. In this case the "leap" was a mixture of demand, the 
effects of productivity increases and demands for higher product 
quality. The case is also a fine example of the effect of 
cooperation between research and industry in order to reach a 
common goal. 
  In Sweden, Rockhammar was the first to install a TMP 
facility. The big industrial breakthrough came when the large 
paper mills, primarily Holmen/Hallsta, rapidly followed by its 
competitors SCA and STORA, built TMP facilities. The recycling 
of steam was important here in order to improve the economy of 
the process and was consequently an important factor in the 
rapid distribution of the technology. The development in Sweden 
occurred at approximately the same time as the corresponding 
development in the large competing countries. 
<H5>  4. Casting Technology in the Steel Industry </H5>
  Over the most recent 20-year period continuous casting has 
become an increasingly predominant casting process in the steel 
industry. As early as the mid-1980's, all commercial steel and 
about 40 percent of all special steel was continuous cast in 
Sweden. In tons, that means 85-90 percent of all steel in the 
country. The world development has also gone toward a higher 
proportion of continuous casting, although Sweden has a larger 
proportion of continuous casting than in other comparable 
countries. For the development of continuous casting in the 
world after 1980, see Figure 1 [not included]. 
  Henri Bessemer as early as 1856 demonstrated a continuous 
casting process for steel. Bessemer proposed casting molten 
metal between two water-cooled rollers. The process soon turned 
out to be difficult to control, however. At the beginning of the 
1900's Bessemer's ideas were again taken up. They were primarily 
applied to nonferrous metals. During the 1930's and 1940's 
continuous casting for nonferrous metals became an operational 
method. In the 1940's German Mannesmann Huettenwerke, among 
others, demonstrated a continuous casting process for steel. In 
the 1950's the industrial development of the continuous casting 
process then took place. The first Swedish continuous casting 
machine was put into operation at Nyby Bruk in 1954 and 
operational experiences were of significance in the work with 
continuous casting in Europe, where one was doubtful about the 
opportunities of the technology. Other than that, no major 
development of the technology took place in this country during 
this period. In the early 1960's the first prototypes of 
continuous casting facilities were built in Sweden. In 1966 the 
first large continuous casting facility in the country was put 
into operation, at the Domnarvet ironworks in Borlange. After 
that followed Oxelosunds ironworks. Up to the mid-1980's most 
block casting was done as continuous casting. 
  The driving forces for switching to continuous casting in 
the 
steel industry were primarily: 


    -  higher yield 
  -  energy savings 
  -  automation of the casting work/personnel savings 
  -  improvement of the material quality 
  -  the material was closer to the finished dimension. 

    The higher material yield, together with the energy savings, 
was the principal reason for the breakthrough. The material 
savings have increased by 10-15 percent with continuous casting. 
Due to the higher material yield, there was particular interest 
at the beginning of the method development in high-alloy 
materials, for which an increase in yield was economically 
significant. But the breakthrough came first on the commercial 
steel side, which was because the special steel manufacturers 
were more uncertain of the quality of the material. The total 
energy saving to produce a substance by continuous casting in 
comparison with block casting is also considerable. The energy 
consumption for block casting with subsequent heating and block 
rolling is about 1,500 kWh/ton. For continuous casting, about 
500 kWh/ton are needed. In continuous casting some processing 
steps, such as heating the ingot in a pit furnace (which is 
oil-fired), are eliminated. 
  Once the technology was well accepted the emphasis was also 
on improving the material quality. More even material 
composition is obtained both lengthwise and crosswise. At the 
beginning of the period there was uncertainty as to whether the 
material quality could be retained. It was not until it was 
possible to prove that the quality of the material could be 
kept, or even improved, that the real breakthrough came. Today, 
this improvement in quality is highly valued. 
  The oil crises of 1974 and 1979 accelerated the development 
of the continuous casting technology. The energy costs, 
primarily the cost of oil, increased their share of the total 
operating costs. It was necessary to save energy. The oil price 
increased by a factor of three in real terms from the early 
1970's to the early 1980's. Every cut in oil consumption was 
valuable. 
  The payoff time for a continuous casting facility could be 
as 
short as two years. For Sweden the structural rationalization in 
the Swedish steel industry, where action was taken early on, was 
a contributing reason for the rapid penetration of the 
technology; continuous casting achieved a more rapid 
breakthrough in Sweden than in many comparable countries. In 
connection with rationalizations, production was concentrated to 
fewer and bigger units. In many cases that meant new 
investments; some of them involved continuous casting facilities. 
  The following statistic [not included] shows the structural 
changes in the industry in Sweden between the years 1975 and 
1988. 
  The capacity for raw iron production dropped between 1975 
and 
1988 from about 4.1 million tons to 2.5 million tons/year. The 
capacity for raw steel production dropped from about 7.54 
million tons/year to 2.5 million tons/year during the same 
period of time. Production was concentrated to a few places. 
Instead, the units became larger. 
  The actual production of raw steel has remained at a stable 
level from 1975 until today. The annual production of raw steel 
lies between 4 and 5 million tons. 
  The next step in casting technology is thin "slabs," that is 
to say a nearly finished form, or direct casting of strips. With 
this the power consumption can be considerably reduced. A 
decrease of up to 50 percent in comparison with continuous 
casting can be achieved, but does not mean very much in absolute 
numbers, see Figure 2 [not included]. The energy aspects are 
also not the driving force. However, considerable cost savings 
can be achieved for investments (smaller plants, certain 
production steps are eliminated) and in production, in the form 
of reduced personnel requirements. 
  The technology is beginning to be commercialized. The first 
facility began operating in 1990 in the United States (Nucor). A 
plant is projected in Italy (Arweri). In Japan and Germany this 
technology is also regarded with major interest. 
  Other energy-saving projects in the steel industry are 
basically "warm flows," meaning minimization of the number of 
reheating steps of the substance until the finished product. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  It can be concluded that the period from the first major 
installation to nearly complete penetration was about 15 years, 
a relatively short period in this context. The technology had 
been known since the 1950's, that is to say about 20 years. In 
spite of that, the technology was not interesting from a 
commercial point of view. The reason was mainly that there was a 
lack of operating experience and full-scale experiments had to 
be done, which required reference objects. 
  That the yield would increase and the energy consumption 
drop 
was an accepted insight. On the other hand, there was doubt that 
the quality of the continuously cast material could be kept. 
  Beginning with the period of World War II and up to 1975 the 
steel industry had stable growth in the quantity of steel of 
about five percent a year. New production units could be made to 
pay off relatively quickly and investments were mainly made in 
conventional and proven technology, that is to say ingot 
casting. The real breakthrough came in connection with the 
necessary restructuring of the industry in the latter part of 
the 1970's. Fewer and larger production units required new 
investments. 
  During this period of the restructuring the continuous 
casting technology was relatively completed, and the advantages 
of the technology made it natural to introduce it on a large 
scale, which caused it to be installed over a rather short 
period of time. 
  It is possible to determine that stimulating programs, such 
as government ones, were largely absent in Sweden, as well as in 
the rest of the world. The continuous casting technique was 
developed on a strict commercial basis. This means that the 
introduction took place on its own technical and economic 
merits, which required a number of concurrent factors for the 
commercial breakthrough to occur. 
<H5>  5. Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion of Coal (PFBC) </H5>
  A fluidized bed is, simply stated, a bed of particles raised 
by a gas flowing through, which makes the bed behave as a fluid. 
  The fluidized bed began to be developed in the 1920's in 
Germany. In the 1940's the petroleum industry used fluidized 
beds to crack crude oil. During the 1960's, primarily in Great 
Britain, interest awakened in combustion of coal in pressurized 
fluidized beds (PFBC). Government funds had been invested in it, 
for example. There were few entrepreneurs who were interested in 
developing the idea industrially, however. 
  The ideas came to Stal Laval[.sup]13[/] in Finspang by way 
of Great Britain during the late 1960's. At Stal Laval this 
idea was being worked on. No major resources were invested, but 
the idea was brought forward to basic system concepts. 
  There were several reasons for the interest. 


    -  Coal had the future ahead of it: It has a more stable 
price picture than oil, and there will be enough for about 200 
years. But coal had the image of being dirty and obsolete. It 
was a matter of finding a modern way to burn coal. 
  -  Within the company, which at that time produced nuclear 
turbines and turbines and turbine systems for ships, for 
example, a change was seen in the market for these. The 
objective was to enter new markets, to some extent. 
  -  The environmental aspects of combustion, primarily the sulfur 
fallout, were beginning to be debated and this debate was likely 
to intensify. The pressurized fluidized bed could be a solution, 
environmentally speaking. 

    It was believed that there was a market, and the interest 
shown by potential customers was studied in the early 1970's. 
Both Vattenfall and Sydkraft, as well as some foreign companies 
were contacted. But in Sweden it was nuclear power as well as 
hydroelectric power that were being expanded, and no one saw any 
need to generate power with coal. Simultaneously, oil prices 
were low and the oil crises had not yet hit the western world. 
  The pressurized fluidized bed (PFBC) was known within the 
company and therefore by the management as well. 
  In 1976 Curt Nicolin, who was managing director of ASEA, of 
which Stal Laval was a subsidiary, dedicated a facility 
delivered to American Electric Power (AEP) by ASEA. In this 
connection the PFBC concept was discussed. AEP became 
interested. AEP is the largest coal-burning power company in the 
western world and produced as much power as is used in Sweden. 
Nearly all of AEP's production is based on coal and based on 
high-sulfuric (4-5 percent) coal in the Ohio region. One had 
begun to notice a certain criticism of coal burning, with the 
attendant pollution and sulfur emissions. The company was forced 
to alter the prevailing image of high-sulfur coal and its 
environmental effects or utilize low-sulfur coal, which was not 
available in the company's own mines. In broad outlines the PFBC 
concept met AEP's requirements for modern coal combustion. 
  The PFBC project at Stal Laval began in 1976. With AEP as a 
potential customer and partner, one dared invest on a large 
scale. 
  The first project was a feasibility study at AEP. One 
proceeded from there. Toward the end of the 1970's Stal Laval 
spent large resources on the PFBC project. In cooperation with 
AEP a major test program was carried out in Great Britain. In 
the early 1980's discussions were held regarding a full-scale 
facility in Ohio. AEP wanted additional tests, however, with 
their own coal, among other things. A 15-MW test plant was built 
at the Oresund plant in Malmo. The facility was ready in 1983 
and had in principle been financed by Stal Laval. The first 
tests with American coal were carried out in 1983/84. At the end 
of 1986 AEP received support from both the Department of Energy 
(DoE) and the State of Ohio Coal Development Office, which is 
likely to have been of significance for the order. The plant was 
put into operation in early 1991. 
  In connection with ASEA's 100th anniversary in 1983, 
lectures 
were given about PFBC. The technical director of the 
semi-state-owned Spanish energy producer Endesa who listened to 
one of these lectures became interested in the idea. The problem 
in Spain is that coal with a high ash content and extremely high 
sulfur content is burned, in short poor-quality coal. In order 
to compensate for this, the world's tallest chimneys until now 
had been built in Spain. But this method was no longer accepted 
in Spain or by the neighboring countries. A major need for 
expansion was anticipated in the 1990's. As early as 1984 the 
first Spanish coal was tested in the test facility in Malmo. The 
result was positive. In 1986 it was decided to build an 80-MW 
test facility. The Spanish project has received subsidies from 
the EC. But that was not the deciding factor in the choice of 
technology. The facility was put into operation in early 1991. 
  Within the ASEA group it was in the early 1980's believed 
that thee was a market in Sweden as well. Important factors were 
that one was being forced to replace the expensive oil and that 
the environmental demands for "pure" combustion technology had 
grown stronger. A political decision had been made to abolish 
nuclear power. It was not a powerful reason, but it was surely 
used as an argument in some circles. Vattenfall planned a 
coal-based power plant in Oxelosund, but that was too far into 
the future to be of any interest. 
  In 1982 Stockholm Energi began to work out a proposal for 
coal conversion at the Vartan facility. The alternative, which 
was developed within the energy company, involved using the 
existing turbine and the existing furnace. A covered coal depot 
was to be built, as well as a desulfurization facility. But the 
permit application was pulled back before it was considered by 
the Concession Board. It would probably not have passed because 
it would not have received a site permit for the facility. In 
order to burn coal, the "most recently available technology" was 
a requirement, which conventional coal conversion could not be 
said to equate. 
  At about the same time the Oil Replacement Delegation had 
begun to belabor the big cities on issues involving conversion 
from heating with oil to other fuels. There was pressure to 
shift to coal combustion, which could be utilized for marketing 
the PFBC. 
  The decision-making process, which lasted from 1983 to 1987 
when the management of Stockholm Energi decided to build a PFBC 
facility for 130 MW electricity and 210 MW heat, was long, and 
many alternatives were discussed. Discussions were also held at 
the ministerial level. The decision came to be regarded by many 
as a political decision. 
  The studies around a PFBC facility in Vartan or Hasselby 
were 
initiated in 1984. Various groups were appointed to oversee the 
technology and economy. Representatives of Stockholm Energi, 
ASEA, Vattenfall and Sydkraft, among others, participated in the 
groups. 
  Several different alternatives were brought up against each 
other: pulverized coal, CFB (circulating fluidized bed) and 
PFBC. The final choice was a PFBC facility at Vartan with two 
modules, each with 200 MW fuel effect. 
  However, Stockholm Energi and ASEA did not agree on a number 
of questions regarding the technology, which was untested on a 
large scale. During 1985/86 verifications were undertaken which 
provided answers to several of the questions about the 
technology. 
  In early 1986 ASEA proposed a turn-key solution, in which 
ASEA assumed the principal risks. The crucial decision in favor 
of a PFBC solution was then made at the beginning of 1987. 
  The dialogue in the technical development and projection 
phase has been relatively successful. There was not always 
agreement, but the problems were solved. 
  Today, availability and performance tests are under way at 
the facility. 
  Final payment has not yet been made. Today the costs, based 
on the cost of living, etc., amount to over 2 billion kronor. No 
development support has been given to the customer, except for a 
general environmental contribution. 
  In 1990 ABB Carbon signed an agreement with Japanese 
Ishikawajima Harima Heavy Industry (IHI), which includes the 
transfer of PFBC technology to Japan. IHI is one of Japan's 
largest energy producers. The Japanese cooperation is seen as 
very important today. A PFBC 200 is projected (the same as the 
one at Vartan, which is to be completed in 1993). 
  There have not yet been any additional contracts from AEP or 
Endesa. They are expected within one or a couple of years, 
however. Discussions concerning PFBC plants are under way with 
many potential customers today. After the mid-1990's and for the 
next 10 years facilities have been planned for coal technology 
with 360,000 MW output. The dominant portion is expected to 
involve "pure" coal technology. 
  Competitors in this field are Mitsubishi, Deutsche Babcock 
and, to some extent, Pyro Power, which is a subsidiary of 
Ahlstrom. But ABB is ahead of its competitors today, thanks to 
the pilot and reference facilities it has. 
  ABB has not yet received any major government contribution 
to 
develop the technology. About 50 million kronor were obtained in 
various development subsidies. The total development budget is 
on the order of 1 billion kronor. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  A system concept for the principle, based on a potential 
future technology, had been developed. The advantages of the 
system were: 


    -  high degree of efficiency and high electric power/heat 
ratio 
  -  environmentally friendly 
  -  the facilities are physically smaller than conventional 
pulverized coal facilities. 

    AEP and Endesa saw the advantages of the technology. Both 
had 
high-sulfur coal in their own region and this technology would 
enable continued utilization of these high-sulfur coals. 
  On the part of AEP, federal funds can have been significant 
in daring to invest in this new technology; in the United States 
funding of this type is very common. On the part of Endesa, the 
technology was viewed as having a future in Spain, where large 
amounts of low-quality coal are available. 
  Political control factors were of relatively major 
importance 
for the Vartan project. From an environmental point of view the 
framework conditions were fixed at an early stage. PFBC was 
represented as the alternative which would best meet the 
environmental requirements. If the plans for coal conversion at 
Vartan had been completed, and the permit obtained, and if no 
influence had been exerted from official authorities and organs 
regarding the environmental aspects, for example, which the 
energy producers in the early 1980's often viewed with less 
interest than today, it is likely that PFBC would not have been 
chosen. With conventional technology it is possible today to get 
just as "pure" technology as with PFBC. But PFBC has a higher 
degree of efficiency, which was not always evident in the 
process concerning Vartan. The PFBC alternative was probably 
also favored from the aspect of industrial policy, where the 
future export potentials were stressed. 
  Commercialization of the technology came with Vartan as a 
demonstration facility, and this is definitely of crucial 
importance for the continued success of the technology, but 
mainly outside Sweden. 
  Without a large reference facility, the technology would not 
have been commercialized this quickly. 
<H5>  6. The Stirling Engine </H5>
  The Stirling engine is not a new type of engine. It was 
invented by a Scottish priest, Robert Stirling, who in 1816 drew 
up the principles for a heat engine with combustion outside the 
cylinder. Stirling's engine was clumsy, however, and the 
development had a minor effect. 
  In 1938 Dutch Philips took up the idea of the Stirling 
engine. The reason for Philips' interest was that the engine 
could be used to generate electric power for radio and other 
electrical equipment in unexploited areas where kerosene and oil 
were available, primarily the Dutch colonies at that time in 
Asia. As a result of the development of the electronics, 
however, primarily the transistor, interest in the Stirling 
engine subsided. 
  At the end of the 1960's several Swedish companies were 
interested in the Stirling engine. This culminated in 1968 in 
the founding of United Stirling AB in Malmo. Owners of the 
company were FFV, Husqvarna and Kockums. A licensing agreement 
for the Philips- developed Stirling engine was bought, I-98, an 
engine which developed 10-20 KW power, varying somewhat 
depending on the version. This model represented the basis for 
the development at United Stirling. 
  FFV felt political pressure to begin looking at civilian 
applications; there were, for example, proposals for FFV to 
begin developing materials and systems for health care. The 
Stirling engine concept appeared to be a potential solution for 
the future. It was environmentally friendly, fuel-saving, could 
be used with many different fuels and the number of possible 
applications was large. 
  Husqvarna wanted to supplement its production of small 
engines and was interested in engines for electricity and heat 
generation in housing. The Stirling engine was regarded as 
interesting for the future. 
  Both FFV and Husqvarna had mechanical engineering plants 
which were potential units for large-scale industrial production 
of Stirling engines. Furthermore, FFV had materials laboratories 
where work on heat-resistant materials and processing of these 
was carried out. Know-how in this field is of significance for 
Stirling engines. 
  Kockums' idea was originally to utilize the Stirling engine 
in submarines. 
  The automobile industry had also participated in the 
discussion, but it was really not very interested. 
  United Stirling's first externally financed project started 
in 1968/69 and included a budget of 6 million kronor. The 
project involved Stirling engines in submarines. The customer 
was the Swedish Navy. 
  Since the potential applications for the Stirling engine 
were 
many and interest in this type of engine had begun to awaken, 
the technicians were to a large extent the ones who decided. 
They foresaw the following applications, for example: 


    -  in submarines 
  -  in cars, trucks and buses 
  -  for stationary power generation 
  -  for heat pumps. 

    Husqvarna pulled out before any actual development had 
begun, 
and that was chiefly for financial reasons. 
  Once the shipyard crisis occurred, United Stirling was 
transferred to Svenska Varv and later Celsius. In 1988 United 
Stirling merged with Kockums and became a part of Kockums. 
Kockums had been reorganized in the mid-1980's. In the 1970's 
FFV had its own unit for development of the Stirling engine in 
Linkoping, FFV Industriprodukter AB, which did not belong to 
United Stirling. At the end of the 1970's, this activity was 
absorbed into United Stirling, however. Certain parts of the FFV 
branch were sold in the mid-1980's to McDonnell Douglas. 
  After the first oil crisis in 1974, the Stirling projects 
were not affected to any major extent. The most tangible change 
was that the potential market, primarily the United States, for 
Stirling engines in motor homes for heat and power generation, 
disappeared. After the second oil crisis, 1978, however, the 
eyes turned to the Stirling engine. Large government subsidies 
were granted internationally for development of the concept. The 
U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) and NASA supported many Stirling 
projects. The total financial support amounted to hundreds of 
millions of dollars each year. Government subsidies were also 
provided in Great Britain, Germany, France, etc. 
  There were about 10 companies worldwide which developed 
Stirling engines for various applications. United Stirling was 
one of them. Most were found in the United States and Germany. 
  The end of the 1970's and early 1980's must be regarded as 
the days of glory for development of the Stirling engine for 
various applications. The public funds which had been allocated 
to the projects all over the world were beginning to show 
results. Many conferences and seminars were arranged about the 
Stirling engine and its various applications. The entire field 
was marked by openness and optimism for the future. 
  At the end of the 1970's and the early 1980's prototypes for 
Stirling applications in cars, buses, trucks, heat pumps, 
solar-powered systems, etc. were presented. The opinion was that 
some of these would become commercially viable within a 
five-year period. A world production of 50,000-100,000 units a 
year was discussed. 
  The prognoses were largely based on continued high fuel 
prices, chiefly diesel, but also gasoline, and generally high 
energy costs. 
  In principle, United Stirling had two large, international, 
development projects, both of which were financed with federal 
U.S. funds. 
  One involved a car concept (financed by DoE) and was aimed 
at 
transferring the technology of the Stirling engine to the United 
States and the development of prototypes. United Stirling's 
annual budgets for the project were 20 million kronor a year for 
nine years. The result of the project was that it was not 
possible to verify that operation of this type of engine was as 
reliable as that of an Otto engine. The tests with the 
prototypes yielded good results, to be sure, but had not been 
carried out for sufficiently long periods. The cost of gasoline 
was not decisive. 
  The second large project involved a solar concentrator, a 
Stirling engine and a generator. The system delivered a 28 
percent yield of produced electric power from incident solar 
energy, which was totally superior to competing solar energy 
converters. The project had a total budget of several hundred 
million kronor and was partly financed by DoE. In 1981 the first 
prototype was built in the Mojave desert in California. In 
1982/83 cooperation with McDonnell Douglas was initiated and the 
federal U.S. funding disappeared. McDonnell Douglas invested 
large amounts in additional development of the concept. A large 
number of units were distributed for testing in desert regions 
in the United States during the period 1983-1985. During this 
period of time the energy prices were so high that this concept, 
despite being relatively expensive to install, was a financially 
good alternative. 
  A market introduction of the solar concentrator in sunny 
regions was regarded as very likely within a few years. At 
United Stirling it was believed that there was a market for up 
to 100 units in the United States alone. When the price of oil 
dropped in 1985, there was no incentive to continue with the 
solar concentrator, and United Stirling sold its rights to the 
United States. 
  Volvo and Saab followed the development during the late 
1970's, above all for large Stirling engine concepts, primarily 
for trucks and buses. However, there were no major government 
subsidies in Sweden in order for Volvo and Saab to participate 
in the development projects. Volvo Penta also held discussions 
involving Stirling engines for use in boats, both as propulsion 
engines and as power and heat generators. But Volvo Penta was 
more interested in being a component supplier. 
  At the beginning of the 1980's, the Swedish Navy resumed its 
ideas about Stirling engines in submarines. The Stirling engine 
is nearly ideal for submarines: 


    -  Independent air supply; combustion of pure oxygen, 
which is stored in liquid form 
  -  combustion takes place at high pressure, with the result that 
emissions can be released without using additional energy 
  -  long operating life 
  -  quiet operation, low vibration level. 

    In 1988/89 Kockums tested a Stirling engine in a submarine, 
the Nacken. Today, the Nacken is in service. The Swedish Navy 
has ordered three submarines of the Gotland series, in which 
Stirling engines are to be used. 
  The Australian Navy has ordered six submarines from Kockums, 
with options for another two. The contract also includes options 
for Stirling engines, but these have not yet been utilized. A 
prototype Stirling engine has been ordered and delivered, 
however. 
  Discussions are now being held with Canada and Malaysia for 
submarines which also include the Stirling engine. Further, 
there are cooperation projects with Kawasaki Heavy Industries on 
Stirling engines for Japanese submarines. 
  Kockums is today the world leader in Stirling engines in 
submarines. 
  Kockums' submarine concept becomes more interesting when it 
is able to offer a solution (Stirling engine) which the 
competitors do not have. 
  The technical breakthrough for this very special application 
has taken more than 20 years and the development budget, at 
United Stirling alone, amounted to more than 1 billion kronor 
over the period at today's prices. Today, about 30 persons at 
Kockums work with Stirling engines. At the end of the 1970's it 
was about 140 persons. 
  United Stirling, together with FFV, has sold approximately 
190 engines up to and including 1991. These were mainly 
prototypes for cars, buses and diverse energy applications, such 
as engines for submarines, etc. 
  The intensive basic development carried out at United 
Stirling in the 1970's had major significance for the technical 
breakthrough for Stirling engines in submarines. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  Theoretically, the Stirling engine is a good concept. The 
number of potential applications are also many. With these 
starting points and with large development budgets, financed 
primarily with government funding, worldwide development was 
begun. Worldwide, nearly 10 billion kronor have been invested to 
try to commercialize the technology. When access to funding for 
development projects was good, increasingly more people became 
interested in the Stirling engine development and the quality of 
certain companies may be questioned. 
  The submarine concept was included early on, but other 
potential applications took over, primarily applications for 
vehicles and the generation of energy, because this was where 
the largest subsidies were. Few development projects were able 
to demonstrate technical-economic gains with the Stirling engine. 
  One potential commercial application existed in the energy 
field, the solar concentrator. Here there were financial 
incentives for continuation: a high degree of efficiency for the 
solar concentrator, combined with high energy costs. With 
continued high energy prices in the United States this system 
would likely have been commercialized on a large scale within a 
few years. Calculations showed that it was financially 
defensible if large-scale engine production were started. At 
this time there was also a certain market pressure in the United 
States. 
  As for submarines, the Stirling engine offers major 
advantages. In the large high-technology systems which 
submarines represent, cost is of lower-ranking importance. 
Kockums' interest in Stirling engines is principally in the 
opportunities to offer more unique solutions for submarines than 
those of its competitors. 
  The technical breakthrough for the Stirling engine within a 
very special field, submarines, has arrived. But to use this to 
state that the technology has been commercialized is going to 
far. 
  Commercial use of the technology for other applications is 
possible under very specific framework conditions, namely high 
energy prices or unique technical requirements/needs. It was 
these framework conditions which were not taken into account 
when the development was at its most intense, during the 1970's. 
Potential applications areas were envisioned and the idea of the 
technology was appealing. The framework conditions were 
relatively static and a change, such as the energy price level, 
altered the picture completely over a short period. 
  Marketing the concept on a large scale is likely to require 
the fulfillment of one or more of the following factors: 


    -  New production technology, which enables more rational 
and thus cheaper production 
  -  New, cheaper materials, which in a better way can cope with 
high temperatures and the complex transfer and conduction of heat 
  -  Large production volume, which in turn requires a market, of 
course. 

  7. Fiberoptic Technology in the Telecommunications 
Network 
  The principle for conducting light with fiberoptics was 
described as early as the beginning of the 1900's. However, the 
basis of fiberoptic communication is considered to be an article 
in the PROCEEDINGS OF IEE, 1966. Two British researchers, C. K. 
Kao and G. A. Hockham, both active at ITT, analyzed the reasons 
for the high attenuation at that time in optical fibers for 
image transmission, about 1,000 dB/km and predicted that one 
should be able to achieve a value of about 20 dB/km, if 
sufficiently pure glass could be produced. Fibers with 
attenuation values at this low level should then also become 
interesting for communication purposes. The U.S. fiberglass 
manufacturer Corning took up the idea, and in 1970 fibers with 
attenuation below 20 dB/km were produced. 
  Corning's successes were the beginning of fibers with ever 
decreasing attenuation. Today, normal attenuation values are 
below 0.25 dB/km with a wavelength of 1,550 nm. 
  There was relative agreement in the telecommunications 
industry in the early 1970's that this new technology would have 
the possibility of drastically changing the telecommunications 
of the future. It was believed that the technology had the 
following potential advantages, among others: 


    -  Large bandwidth and many channels per fiber 
  -  low transmission losses, which results in the possibility of 
bridging large distances without intermediate repeaters 
  -  lower weight and volume compared to other types of 
telecommunications cables, which results in easier installation 
  -  lower installation costs per kilometer, compared to other 
cable 
installation. 

    In the early 1970's it was still difficult to produce 
fiberoptics with low attenuation industrially. The development 
on the fiber side went relatively quickly, however. A few large 
companies such as AT&amp;T, Corning and ITT further developed and 
improved the production technology and the quality of the 
optical fiber. 
  At LM Ericsson activity was begun in the mid-1970's in the 
field of fiberoptics, partly in a group which worked with system 
studies, and partly in a group at the materials laboratory which 
developed the technology for manufacturing fiberoptics. Sieverts 
Kabelverk[.sup]14[/] began to produce optical cable during 
the late 1970's. 
  The Telecommunications Agency has monitored the field 
extensively since the early 1970's, and a large number of future 
possibilities for the technology were seen for Sweden and the 
Swedish telecommunications grid. Commercially, however, the 
technology was not mature. A relatively rapid development of 
fibers took place, and there was continuous improvement in the 
fiber development. Not until the end of the 1970's, however, was 
there a breakthrough for relatively cheap fibers with good 
quality. 
  In the mid-1970's Sweden was a world leader in the field of 
coaxial cable. At the end of the 1950's, as the first 
installation in the world, came a 12-MHz system (2,700 channels 
per coaxial pair) and in the early 1970's came the last analog 
system, 60 MHz (10,800 channels per coaxial pair), also the 
first in the world. The coaxial expansion, combined with 
supplementation by radio link, had provided a certain 
overcapacity in the network. 
  Traffic prognoses during the 1970's were also relatively 
uncertain, and the network was anticipated to grow at only a 
moderate pace. At the Telecommunications Agency no need was seen 
to introduce optical technology on a large scale, at least not 
within the near future. There was, however, long-range planning 
for modernization of the telecommunications network at the 
Telecommunications Agency. Investment plans up to the year 2010 
were available. These plans included optical installations. 
  Tests with optical technology were carried out for strategic 
reasons. Planning for the tests was undertaken as early as 1977 
and in 1979 the Telecommunications Agency carried out tests with 
fiberoptics between, for example, the telephone stations at 
Fredhall and Appelviken in Stockholm. Sieverts Kabelwerk was one 
of the suppliers of cable. At the system level, the 
Telecommunications Agency and Ericsson cooperated. The 
Telecommunications Agency itself took care of the installation. 
  Seen from an international perspective, Sweden was far from 
first. The first tests in the telecommunications field were done 
as early as 1976/77. 
  The Telecommunications Agency began installing optical cable 
in 1982. To begin with, fiberoptics of the "multimode" type were 
installed, with certain physical characteristics. It was 
principally the grids between the local stations in Stockholm, 
Goteborg and, to some extent, Malmo which were upgraded and 
modernized with fiberoptics. Since 1984/85, the 
Telecommunications Agency has installed about 2,500 kilometers 
of optical cable[.sup]15[/] per year. After 1984/85 the 
installations encompassed mainly the long-distance network. 
After 1985 only fibers of the "single mode" type were installed, 
with different physical characteristics than multimode fibers, 
among them higher signal transmission capability. 
  Today, in 1991, about 16,000 kilometers of fiberoptics have 
been installed in the Swedish grid. 
  The next step in the development will be optical cable in 
the 
local networks. Modernizations and upgrading of the local 
metropolitan grids today take place to a large extent using 
fiberoptics. 
  Fiberoptic systems for industrial applications have never 
attracted the same attention, however. The reason for this is 
that it is expensive. Sometimes it can be justified, however, 
for instance if unique requirements such as resistance to 
interference exist or if large volumes of data must be 
transmitted. 
  In the energy field, it may be mentioned that fiberoptics 
can 
be used in the ground lines in power cables. Fiberoptics can 
then be used for rapid transmission of information such as 
controlling the network. Such a power line has been installed in 
Sweden in the vicinity of Forsmark for an overhead cable portion 
of the power connection between Sweden and Finland. 
  Fiberoptic development has also been of importance for 
digitizing telecommunications systems. The introduction of 
digital transmission systems began in Sweden in the early 
1970's. This was also not a field in which Sweden was an 
international pioneer. Toward the end of the 1970's, digital 
switching equipment and stations were introduced, while the 
links were still largely analog. In the early 1980's the 
connections also began to be digitized, first by equipping free 
coaxial pairs in existing coaxial cables, then with newly 
installed optical cables. The Telecommunications Agency and 
Ericsson undertook partially joint development of the digital 
systems for public telecommunications, primarily in the 
switching area (the AXE development). The Telecommunications 
Agency and Ericsson cooperated intimately for a long time. Among 
other things, they jointly own the Ellemtel development 
corporation. 
  Around 1983/84 came a break in the trend in the 
telecommunications field in Sweden. From an annual growth in 
traffic of 1-2 percent, it increased to 5-6 percent. The reasons 
were many. 


    -  A strong increase in the data traffic. It grew by 30 
percent annually, which in turn was due to the definitive 
breakthrough of computers in business and administration. 
  -  The international and long-distance traffic increased. In the 
1980's business and industry became highly internationalized. 
The "service society" was also strengthened, which increases 
telephone traffic. 
  -  An altered attitude toward telephoning has been perceived 
during the 1980's. Younger generations regard the telephone as 
something natural and thus use the telephone to a larger extent. 
The rate of increase in telephone traffic has been about four 
percent a year after 1984/85, which represents a major increase 
in absolute numbers. 
  -  In recent years new telephone services, as well as the fax, 
have also undergone a strong expansion. 

    The break with the trend in 1983/84 was relatively 
unexpected. The prognoses indicated an increase, but not as fast 
and sudden. 
  At the same time demands were raised for more reliability 
and 
accessibility in the telecommunications systems, which resulted 
in reserve capacity having to be built into the system. It was 
realized quite soon that the overcapacity in the grid from the 
late 1970's had been used up. Plans were therefore made for 
continuing high traffic growth for the rest of the 1980's and in 
order to assure high accessibility and security in the network. 
  This had the result that the joint line grid was expanded by 
12-15 percent annually. Optical technology was economically 
superior to other technology in cost per channel. In the 
mid-1980's a digital channel with fiberoptics cost only 
one-fourth of what an analog coaxial channel cost in the 
mid-1970's. 
  The Telecommunications Agency began marketing the Digitalen 
87 project, which involved introduction of a nationwide digital 
network in 1987. It was inaugurated at the end of 1987, as the 
first in the world. Sums corresponding to 7-8 billion kronor a 
year at current prices were invested by the Telecommunications 
Agency in the network. Part of it was fiberoptic. 
  According to the Riksdag decision on new financial rules, 
etc. for the Telecommunications Agency and its subsidiaries, 
after 1985 all external capital acquisition by the group, 
exclusive of its broadcast activity, was financed through 
borrowing in the general credit market. This has also influenced 
the size of the investments, because it became easier for the 
agency to get financing. Investments could be undertaken at a 
more rapid pace. The large investments for a few years in the 
1980's, which involved digitizing the long-distance network, 
caused Sweden to have an early lead internationally. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  The theoretical insights that fiberoptic technology is a 
superior technology for telecommunications came late, not until 
the 1960's, with researchers at ITT and Corning, one of the 
major fiberglass manufacturers, that is to say a company which 
did not at that time have the profile of a telecommunications 
enterprise. 
  When fiber technology became commercially available, at the 
end of the 1970's, many communications administrations had 
"overinvested" and saw no need for new capacity in the near 
future. Test activity with fiberoptics was carried out on a 
small scale, however, as a kind of strategic monitoring. 
  During the 1970's the digitizing of the public 
telecommunications systems also began, on a relatively small 
scale, starting with the switching equipment and later with 
transmission as well. Digital technology was particularly suited 
for use in optical systems. 
  During the first half of the 1980's there occurred a change 
in the growth trend all over the world: Sweden, for example, had 
had growth of 1-2 percent a year, which grew to 5-6 percent a 
year. Major investments in the network were required in order to 
cope with this growth and to achieve a high level with regard to 
availability and operational reliability. 
  Digital technology and optical technology had become 
commercially available during that period. With these 
technologies it was possible to achieve higher capacity and 
quality per invested amount. 
  Digital technology and optical technology met the 
requirements of the market for modern telecommunications during 
a period when new investments in communications networks were 
necessary, which resulted in a rapid breakthrough. 
  Today, the optical technology represents the de facto 
standard for long-distance telecommunication. 
  The development of fiberoptics is taking place at the major 
cable and fiber manufacturers. There are only a few in the world 
today. Fiberoptics itself has become a "standard component." 
Today, it is more correct to regard fiberoptic technology as a 
complete systems technology, of which fiberoptics is only a part. 
  It may be noted that the ideas around fiberoptics are not 
Swedish, and that the early development of fiberoptics was not 
to any major extent done in Sweden. When the fiber became 
commercially available, a major effort was undertaken in this 
country, however, and Sweden became a leading nation as regards 
fiberoptics in the network. This shows that it is possible to 
adopt technology developed elsewhere and become a leader by 
means of major investments. 
<H5>  8. Mobile Telephones </H5>
  The development of mobile telephones, or more correctly 
cellular, analog mobile telephones, took place during the 1980's 
at a rate which exceeded all prognoses and caused a strong 
expansion of the capacity of the networks. At least from a 
historical perspective, mobile telephones will be regarded as 
"one of the most successful technologies of the 1980's." 
  Commercial cellular mobile telephone networks opened in 
Japan 
in 1979, in the Nordic countries in 1981, in Australia in 1981, 
in the United States in 1984 and in Great Britain in 1985. Today 
(August 1991) there are 13.3 million subscribers in the world, 
1.2 million of whom are in the Nordic countries and 550,000 in 
Sweden. 
  The Telecommunications Agency's prognoses for the 
penetration 
of mobile telephones in Sweden was 50,000 subscribers after 10 
years. Sweden and the Nordic countries are today world leaders 
in cellular mobile telephone technology, with players such as 
Ericsson and Nokia as system suppliers and terminal 
manufacturers, and the Telecommunications Agency and its Nordic 
counterparts as operators. 
  Tests of radio reception in cars were initiated as early as 
the 1920's. The police forces in the United States used this 
method to direct police cars. An accelerating factor is likely 
to have been the gangster chases of the 1920's. 
  In the 1930's tests with land-mobile radio began in Sweden 
as 
well. Here as well the police were the first. 
  During the years immediately after World War II, the use of 
land-mobile radio spread rapidly. This was to a large extent 
because of the technical development during the war. 
  At the end of the 1940's, the then Telegraph Administration 
decided to undertake test activity with car telephones. Some 
calculations showed that manual traffic involved considerable 
personnel costs, and the development work was aimed at an 
automatic network. This network came to be the first completely 
automated mobile telephone network in the world. The radio 
equipment was delivered by Svenska Radio AB, a subsidiary of LM 
Ericsson. The system stayed in service until 1969 and had 
slightly more than 100 subscribers at that time. It had local 
coverage in Stockholm and Goteborg. In the mid-1950's the 
development of yet another system began. The official start of 
this system was in 1965, but tests had been under way for some 
years. This system had coverage areas in Stockholm, Goteborg and 
Malmo. 
  In the 1950's and 1960's the know-how about radio telephones 
grew at the Telecommunications Agency and at the radio 
laboratory. 
  At the same rate as the increasing automobile traffic, a 
need 
was perceived in the late 1960's for a mobile telephone system 
with greater range, which even made communication possible 
between the Nordic countries. In 1969 the Telecommunications 
Agency informed its Nordic counterparts that it was beginning to 
work with the next generation of mobile telephone systems. It 
was long-range work, and a complete system could hardly be 
finished before the end of the 1970's. Further, it would be of 
major advantage if a similar service could be achieved in the 
other Nordic countries. A working group, with representatives of 
the telecommunications administrations of Sweden, Denmark, 
Finland and Norway, was appointed with the task of working out 
joint specifications for a future automated mobile telephone 
system. The working group was given the name of NMT, the Nordic 
Mobile Telephone group. The leading part of the NMT group was 
the Swedish Telecommunications Agency. The cost sharing by the 
NMT group was based on the number of telephones in each country, 
which caused the Telecommunications Agency to be responsible for 
half of the costs. Another aspect that should be mentioned is 
that the cost for specification and subsequent development could 
be reduced, if more parties were involved. This part was not 
insignificant. The NMT group began to specify an automatic 
mobile telephone system which was to operate in the 450 MHz band. 
  At the same time demands began to be raised for an interim 
solution, in the form of a manual system, before the automatic 
NMT system had been completely specified, developed and tested. 
In the early 1970's an interim, manual mobile telephone system 
was therefore put into operation. This system became known as 
MTD and also operated in the 450 MHz band. One reasons for this 
was that there was a certain amount of customer pressure for 
mobile telephones, primarily outside the large metropolitan 
regions. Another was that marketing the manual system was good 
for becoming accustomed to mobile telephones, which could 
provide the automatic system with a flying start. At its 
largest, the MTD system had 19,000 subscribers. The system was 
gradually abolished during the 1980's. 
  The NMT group was providing continuous information to the 
Nordic industry about its work. The industry also had 
opportunities to comment on the NMT group's work and to submit 
viewpoints. In 1975 a system specification draft was ready. That 
same year the Nordic telecommunications administrations decided 
to develop the system. By their work with the system, the NMT 
group had acquired detailed knowledge, which could be 
transferred, although not without considerable work, to the 
industry in the form of specifications. 
  The starting point for the construction was determined to be 
a number of basic requirements which were believed to meet the 
future subscribers' demands adequately, and the technical and 
economic preconditions. 
  The special function which permits calling up a mobile 
subscriber without the need to know where he is is called 
"roaming" and is made possible by the fact that a mobile station 
which leaves a covered area for a base radio station and enters 
a new one automatically reports this to the switching station. 
Further, during a conversation it may happen that a mobile 
subscriber gets outside the area of coverage for the base 
station in which the conversation is taking place. The move 
results in poorer conversation quality. The quality is checked 
by means of a monitoring signal. These special functions were 
technically complicated. 
  In the mid-1970's the AXE-13 exchange from LM Ericsson was a 
potential alternative. As early as a year or so later, the first 
AXE exchange was put into operation, and this type of exchange 
can be equipped with modules which can execute the exchange 
functions of the mobile telephone. The choice of exchange 
therefore fell to AXE. This exchange was not intended, in its 
original function, to be used for radio telephones. Because of 
the modular composition, it was possible to equip AXE with a 
radio portion with certain modifications. In 1977 a test system 
was installed in the Stockholm region in order to verify that 
the relatively complicated signalling functioned reliably. 
Extensive tests were carried out with this system for a few 
years. 
  The specifications were adjusted a number of times, and not 
until 1978 was the contract signed for purchase of exchanges and 
base radio stations. 
  The NMT system was put into service in the four Nordic 
countries in 1981. In Sweden NMT achieved more or less national 
coverage as early as the end of 1983. The same applies to 
Denmark. In Finland and Norway only the southern parts of the 
countries had been covered by the end of 1983, but on the other 
hand these parts are the most populated. 
  All development prognoses for the number of subscribers were 
exceeded, and as early as 1983/84 capacity problems began to 
occur in the major cities, primarily Stockholm. As a means of 
increasing the capacity, the introduction of small cellular 
technology began, which makes it possible for each frequency to 
be utilized more efficiently. In Stockholm such a system was put 
into operation in 1985. It was only a temporary solution, 
however. Capacity problems occurred relatively soon again. 
Small cellular technology was a part of the system description 
at an early stage, however. 
  At the end of 1986 a new system was put into operation, 
which 
was based on the same technical principles but worked in the 900 
MHz band, which meant shorter range but more channels per 
frequency compared to the NMT 450 system. Just a few years later 
the rate of increase was higher in NMT 900 than in NMT 450. The 
area of coverage for NMT 900 was limited to the major cities and 
principal roads. The area of coverage has gradually increased 
and today the greater part of Sweden is covered. NMT 900 has not 
received the same breakthrough in the other Nordic countries, 
however. 
  Up to 1988 most of the mobile telephones sold were mounted 
in 
vehicles. After 1988 more and more non-vehicle-mounted terminals 
have been sold, so-called pocket telephones, or more commonly 
"yuppie teddy bears." The real expansion came with the arrival 
of the pocket telephones. In 1990 more than 130,000 telephones 
were sold in Sweden, half of which were pocket telephones. The 
pocket telephones can only be used with NMT 900. The price for 
them has dropped from about 25,000 kronor in 1988 to 
12,000-15,000 kronor today and are still dropping. 
  The development of the number of mobile telephones in Sweden 
is shown in Figure 1 [not included]. 
  It should also be mentioned in this connection that 
Kinnevik-owned Comvik has been operating a cellular mobile 
telephone network in the 450-MHz band since 1981. Today it has 
about 15,000 subscribers in its system, which is the number for 
which there is space in the frequency range Comvik has been 
allocated. 
  Today, the mobile telephone systems are also in the 
beginnings of digitization. Agreement has been reached in Europe 
on a common standard, GSM (Groupe System Mobile). GSM operates 
in the 900 MHz band. Large development sums have been spent on 
GSM projects in Europe. Test activity is under way today in most 
European countries. Development of digital systems is also under 
way in the United States and Japan, but not according to the GSM 
standard. 
  As for GSM, the Nordic countries are not likely to become 
the 
leading ones. Large amounts are being invested in countries such 
as Germany, Great Britain and France, where there is a lack of 
well-developed analog systems. In the Nordic countries there are 
well-functioning analog systems and demands for digital systems 
will not be made by the market, at least not within the next few 
years. 
  On the supplier side, Ericsson is today the leader in the 
market, with about 40 percent of the world's subscribers using 
systems delivered by Ericsson. Throughout the 1980's Ericsson 
succeeded in holding on to this market share although the 
development has been explosive. Since the mid-1980's the number 
of subscribers has more or less doubled each year. It is even 
more remarkable that in the United States Ericsson is bigger 
than Motorola, if one counts the number of subscribers coupled 
to the respective suppliers' systems. 
  The know-how in the radio field existed early on at Svenska 
Radio AB, which at that time was a subsidiary of LM Ericsson. 
  The NMT group's choice of LM Ericsson as a supplier of 
exchanges for the NMT system gave the company a few years' lead 
over its competitors and is likely to have been a contributing 
factor for Ericsson's position as world leader today. Some 
development of the radio modules for AXE also took place at the 
development corporation Ellemtel, jointly owned by Ericsson and 
the Telecommunications Agency. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  From the aspect of the future system, there was a customer 
willing to take risks, the Telecommunications Agency, which 
started a large project with a relatively poor foundation for 
the way the future market might develop. The agency's prognoses 
for the NMT system were not made until the early 1980's and 
indicated 50,000 subscribers after 10 years, which turned out to 
be a major prognosis failure. These prognoses were based on the 
increase, when it was as it largest, of the MTD system, and no 
in-depth analyses of market demands were made. 
  There were ideas about how it would function technically. It 
should be pointed out here that the expertise at the radio 
laboratory was the foundation for the technical principles. A 
well-developed technical specification was then worked out, in 
which several parties participated. 
  There was, further, at least one major supplier which 
dominated both the radio and telephone technology of the 
country, Ericsson. The cooperation between the 
Telecommunications Agency and Ericsson goes far back in time and 
has been good. 
  The extensive activity involving the specification and 
development of the systems during the 1970's then gave the 
Nordic countries advantages and the Nordic companies, above all, 
a lead in comparison with their competitors, and this is one of 
the reasons for Ericsson's successes in the field. 
  It turned out that there was clearly a need for mobile 
telephones in the country. The reasons for this are many, but 
the ones to be stressed are that the system was user-friendly 
and that it could largely be used the same way as ordinary 
telephones. In addition, access is increased with mobile 
telephone, which is also shown in that most mobile telephones 
are found among small and medium-sized enterprises. It may be 
mentioned that mechanics, repairmen, electricians, etc. are a 
major user group. Seen from an international perspective, this 
is likely to be quite unique. In other countries the mobile 
telephone has mostly, at least so far, been used at the 
"executive" level in companies and organizations. 
  The fact that the system is national and not local, as most 
of the systems in the United States, makes it possible further 
to increase access. There is no need to worry about where the 
subscriber is. 
  In the late 1980's the number of subscribers grew sharply, 
although the increase was higher in percent during the first 
years of the 1980's. Factors which might have affected the 
increase have been that the personal cost to the individual has 
been so low and to some extent could be regarded as a wage 
benefit. Owning a pocket telephone in the late 1980's may also 
have been regarded as a status symbol, in many cases. 
  The increase in the number of new subscribers dropped at the 
end of 1990 and 1991. The decrease has not been as sharp as 
other activity in the country. From 12,000-15,000 new 
subscribers a month at the end of 1989 and early 1990, a 
decrease has occurred to about 10,000 new subscribers each 
month. The reasons for this are partly the economy, partly that 
the market is beginning to be saturated. Telecommunications in 
general turn out to be less sensitive to economic fluctuations 
than other activities, which is also demonstrated by the mobile 
telephone development over the most recent year. 
  Finally, the price of services has been stable. Connection 
fees, subscriber charges and rates have dropped in real terms 
over the 10 years the systems have been in operation. The cost 
of terminals has also declined sharply, from about 25,000 kronor 
for an NMT 450 terminal in the early 1980's to about 5,000-8,000 
kronor today at current prices. As for pocket telephones, they 
have dropped from about 25,000 kronor in 1988 to 12,000-15,000 
kronor today at current prices. Although the cost sensitivity is 
relatively low, it is likely to have influenced the development 
in a positive manner.

<H5>  1. Introduction and Summary </H5>
  The following represented foundation material for a 
discussion meeting at IVA on 11 February 1992 on mechanisms for 
successful, commercially operated, technical development in the 
energy sector, Energy for Future Generations. 
  The foundation material consists of seven case descriptions 
of mainly technical development projects, in which public 
influence in some form governed the direction and volume of the 
development. 
  The principal question which will be discussed is what 
opportunities the state, or public organs, have of influencing 
and facilitating commercial technical development. The main 
question can then be broken down into the following questions: 


    -  What technology-driving effect do various types of 
means of control have? 
  -  What impact on investment decisions do these means of control 
have? 
  -  Which parts of the innovation process should the state 
support? 
  -  What are the limitations and problems with government 
intervention? 

    One possible breakdown of public means of control which can 
be used for achieving specific goals is: 


    -  Legislation and regulation 
  -  Financing 
  -  Education and information 
  -  Taxes and fees 
  -  Government purchasing 
  -  Government-financed companies and government-financed R&amp;D 

    The usefulness and purpose of these means vary. Within the 
field of energy technology, in which the state has a major 
influence and investments are extensive, the processes are 
likely to be particularly large and several of the above means 
of control could be usable. 
  In the following, several of the means of control mentioned 
above are exemplified. Two of the cases refer to descriptions of 
developments in countries other than Sweden. 
  The following cases are described: 


    -  The adjustment of the German power industry to new 
regulations for SO[.sup]x[/]/NO[.sub]x[/]emissions 
  -  Bioenergy in Sweden 
  -  Swedish nuclear waste technology 
  -  The heat pump development in Sweden 
  -  Energy consulting by the regional development funds 
  -  Efficient use of electric power in the United States 
  -  The adjustment of the pulp and paper industry to AOX 
regulations for organochlorine compounds. 

    The case of the "German power industry" deals with 
tightening 
the legislation for SO[.sup]2[/] and NO[.sub]x[/] emission 
which have taken place during the 1980's. This resulted in the 
undertaking of a gigantic investment program, which has cost on 
the order of 75 billion kronor. Over the 1980's the 
SO[.sup]2[/] and NO[.sub]x[/] emissions have dropped by 80 
and 75 percent, respectively. 
  The "bioenergy" case exemplifies government steering of 
economic parameters. The rapid expansion of the bioenergy 
industry in the early 1980's was based on, among other things, 
calculations in which certain parts could be regarded as 
"political promises." These "political promises" could not be 
kept, and many calculations failed. 
  The "nuclear waste technology" case shows the linkage 
between 
the strict legislation in the waste area and the massive 
development effort undertaken in the late 1970's and early 
1980's. The powerful effort was of major importance for the 
continued development of waste treatment technology both in 
Sweden and abroad. 
  The "heat pump" case describes how government measures, 
primarily in the form of investment support and higher taxes on 
oil, strengthened the competitive ability of the heat pump, and 
a strong market growth occurred. When the price of oil then 
dropped sharply in 1985-86, the market nearly collapsed in some 
segments. 
  The "energy consulting" case exemplifies information as a 
means of control. The case also shows the difficulties of 
measuring the effects of contributions of this type. 
  The "efficient power use" case describes the efforts made by 
the U.S. power companies to reduce energy use and peak 
consumption and the results achieved. The costs to reduce energy 
consumption and peak use have been high, although in percent the 
cuts have been modest. It has often been possible to justify the 
reduction by using a "least cost planning" model, meaning how 
much the power saved would have cost if one were forced to 
invest in the corresponding amount of new power. 
  The "adjustment to AOX regulations" case demonstrates how 
the 
Swedish forest industry introduced known technology, although 
untested on a full scale, in order to achieve the government's 
strict environmental goals. By so doing it has also been 
possible to acquire market advantages quite rapidly. 
<H5>  2. The Adjustment of the German </H5>
[.sup]16[/] Power Industry 
to New Regulations for SO[.sup]x[/]/NO[.sub]x[/] Emissions 
  The Energy Situation 
  The western German gross production of electric power in 
1989 
amounted to 440 TWh, in which nuclear power produced 34 percent 
and hard coal and soft coal nearly 50 percent. Oil and natural 
gas account for another few percent of the power production. The 
total western German fossil-fuelled power capacity is about 
38,000 MW. 
  In the 1960's the share of oil in the production of electric 
power grew. After the first oil crisis in 1973-74, however, the 
proportion of oil decreased. In the 1970's nuclear power was 
also introduced, and today it produces a considerable part of 
the power. Natural gas also began to be used for electricity 
production during the 1970's; natural gas is mainly used for 
heating, however. Power production based on hard coal has also 
grown since the 1970's, which was chiefly due to the means of 
control utilized by the state. 
  The domestic hard coal is expensive to mine. One way of 
protecting the domestic hard coal industry has been for the 
power producers to receive cash compensation for their higher 
costs when using domestic hard coal. The cash is taken from 
special funds which have been established by adding a certain 
percentage to the cost of electricity, called "Kohlepfennig" 
[coal pfennig], which represents an average of eight percent of 
the price of power; the size of the surcharge varies somewhat 
between the various laender. 
  In 1980 the power producers[.sup]17[/] and the hard coal 
industry signed a 15-year business agreement which is known as 
the "Jahrhundertvertrag" [century agreement]. In practice, the 
result of the agreement has been that further expansion of all 
other types of power production has ceased at the expense of 
power production based on hard coal. In the latter part of the 
1980's, the installed capacity of the hard coal plants has been 
expanded, or is expected to expand in the next few years, by 
about 5,000 MW. 
  When the agreement was made, the annual increase in gross 
electric power consumption was 3-5 percent, while the increase 
in the late 1980's was about one percent a year and is expected 
to stay at an average of one percent a year until the year 2000. 
Today there is no room for either oil- or gas-fired power 
plants, the construction of which furthermore requires special 
permission in accordance with the law on electric power 
production. Nuclear power is not going to be added to, either. 
There is also some doubt about nuclear power. For example, the 
Social Democratic party congress (SPD) in 1986 decided to 
abolish nuclear power within 10 years if the party comes into 
power. 
  The importance of coal, in particular hard coal, for the 
energy system is important to stress. 
  The Entry of the Environmental Issues and the 
Environmental Legislation 
  The environmental debate got under way in earnest at the end 
of the 1970's. In a relatively short time it achieved a firm 
anchoring in the country. The Greens (die Gruenen) entered 
several of the laender parliaments as well as the Bundestag in 
1983. Increasingly more frequent and threatening reports about 
the increasing "forest death" were presented. The principal 
blame was initially laid on sulfur emissions and "acid rain." 
Somewhat later the nitrogen oxides (NO[.sup]x[/]) became the 
object of debate, which has caused automobile traffic to be 
criticized as well. What triggered the tightening and revisions 
of the federal laws that has taken place in the 1980's was 
mainly the debate about forest damage. In the early 1980's 
studies were undertaken which showed that up to 50 percent of 
the forest was damaged and about half of the damaged forest 
displayed serious damage. Although there was a lack of strict 
scientific proof in some situations, most experts agreed that 
the emissions did play a major role. 
  In western Germany all air quality issues are regulated by a 
framework law called the Bundes-Immissions-Schutzgesetz 
(BImSchG) of 1974. The framework law then includes a number of 
ordinances (Verordnungen) which have been continuously expanded, 
tightened and revised during the 1970's and 1980's. Furthermore, 
there are additional directives and recommendations at the 
laender level, which in many cases involve further tightening of 
the federal legislation. In North Rhine-Westphalia, for example, 
air quality matters are regulated in a considerably stricter 
manner than in other laender. The articles which regulate 
emissions into the air include hundreds of pages, and even 
experts believe that it is difficult to acquire complete 
understanding of the entire system. 
  The ordinance which has been of major importance for the 
development during the 1980's is GFAVO 
(Grossfeueranlagenverordnung) or 13. BImSchV, originally from 
1983, but further tightened after 1983. This ordinance regulates 
limits[.sup]18[/] for emissions of SO[.sup]2[/] and 
NO[.sup]x[/] from combustion in facilities with more than 50 
MW thermal output. 
  After July 1983 the standards for SO[.sup]2[/] emissions 
were set at 400 mg per m[.sup]3[/] dry stack gas volume at 5 
percent O[.sup]2[/] content for a coal-fired facility with 
300 MW thermal output. In addition, measures must have been 
undertaken for a stack gas desulfurization of at least 85 
percent. The standards for NO[.sup]x[/] emissions were set in 
July 1983 at 800 mg per m[.sup]3[/] for facilities in 
operation. In November 1983 the NO[.sup]x[/] levels were 
reduced to 400 mg per m[.sup]3[/] and in April 1984 to 200 mg 
per m[.sup]3[/] for all facilities. The reason for this sharp 
cutback was primarily that there were functioning techniques in 
Japan which could work at these levels. 
  Yet another ordinance which has been revised in the 1980's 
and has influenced the situation is TA Luft (Technische 
Anleitung zur Reinhaltung der Luft) or a supplement to 1. 
BImSchV, from 1986. It regulates emissions of NO[.sup]x[/] 
from combustion in plants with an output of between 1 and 50 MW. 
The standards are between 300 and 500 mg per m[.sup]3[/]. 
Ordinances also exist which regulate emissions from facilities 
up to 1 MW. 
  A gradual plan for meeting the limits according to GFAVO and 
its supplements was also established. The limits for 
SO[.sup]2[/] and NO[.sub]x[/] were to be met no later than 
1 July 1988. After possibilities of exemption, all power plants 
must meet the demands no later than 1 April 1993 or be closed 
down. 
  The environmental goals of the Umweltbundesamt (UBA), the 
German equivalent of the Nature Conservancy Board, were that 
between the years 1982 and 1993 the SO[.sup]2[/] emissions 
from power plants should be reduced by 75 percent, and 
NO[.sup]x[/] emissions should have dropped by 70 percent by 
the early 1990's. 
  Furthermore, western Germany was one of the members of the 
so-called "30-percent club," meaning the nations which signed a 
convention involving a cutback of SO[.sup]2[/] emissions by 
30 percent by 1993. The reference year was 1980. Western Germany 
went further than that, however, and promised a reduction of 60 
percent. 
  GFAVO regulates emission levels for a total of about 1,500 
furnaces (both thermal and electric power) and TA Luft regulates 
emission levels for a total of 50,000 furnaces (mainly heat). 
  The Technology Development of Gas Purification 
  In general may be said that publicly funded research and 
development in this field has been considerable. The organ which 
early on supported research and development of desulfurization 
was the UBA. Publicly funded pilot facilities for partial 
desulfurization had already been built in the late 1960's. 
  Investment-supporting measures have also been utilized. 
Since 
1975 it has been possible to write off "environmental 
investments" more advantageously than other investments. In the 
late 1970's investment support programs for modernizing old 
plants were also initiated (Altanlagensanierungsprogram). The 
program had a budget of 560 billion German marks [DM] from 
1979-87 and a large part of allocated funds were used for 
SO[.sup]2[/]purification. The burners were also further 
developed in the 1970's, and lower emission values could be 
achieved, primarily for NO[.sup]x[/], with modification of 
the burners. 
  In the following it is important to distinguish between the 
development of SO[.sup]2[/] purification and NO[.sub]x[/] 
purification, since their technological development has been 
different. 
<H5>  SO </H5>
[.sup]2[/] 
  The original techniques for SO[.sup]2[/] purification are 
both German and foreign, primarily U.S., but the techniques have 
been further developed in western Germany. Public funding was 
clearly of significance. 
  In the legislation the concept "Stand der Technik" is used. 
By that is meant that the technology available at each point in 
time is to be used. 
  It takes more than five years from receipt of an order by a 
supplier until the facility is in operation, approved and 
transferred. After that time, the "Stand der Technik" is at a 
different level. This has had the result, for example, that 
since the 1970's the power plant industry has required the 
suppliers of new or added facilities not to emit more than half 
the amount of SO[.sup]2[/] prescribed in the permit agreement. 
  The result of applying the "Stand der Technik" was that the 
reference facilities built in West Germany in the 1970's met the 
GFAVO's 1983 standards for SO[.sup]2[/] even when put into 
service. The technology for SO[.sup]2[/]was largely developed 
even when the GFAVO's regulations began to take effect. This is 
shown in Figure 1 [not included]. About 15 percent of the 
capacity of fossil-fuelled plants in fact had desulfurization 
devices as early as the end of 1983. 
  By the end of 1988 165 stack gas desulfurization facilities 
had been installed and put into operation at 72 different power 
plants. 
  Nearly 90 percent of the facilities are a type of wet 
scrubber with lime or limestone as absorbent and with gypsum as 
end product. About seven percent are of the dry type or 
spray-absorption type, which produce calcium sulfate, sulfite or 
other substances. The others, that is to say a very small 
proportion, operate with regenerative processes. 
  The fact that wet scrubbers dominate is because the 
technology is well developed, operation reliable and the degree 
of efficiency high. Absorbency is cheap, and the byproduct 
gypsum has many areas of application. At present about 3 million 
tons of gypsum a year are produced, which corresponds roughly to 
the annual consumption in western Germany. The gypsum is largely 
exported, however, primarily to Poland. The power companies and 
the gypsum industry cooperate regarding the gypsum production by 
the power plants and sales are normally regulated in contracts. 
  During the 1983-88 period, the emission level for generating 
power with respect to SO[.sup]2[/] declined by 80 percent to 
400,000 tons/year. 
<H5>  NO </H5>
[.sup]x[/] 
  As for techniques to purify NO[.sup]x[/], these were 
further developed from licensing agreements acquired from Japan 
in 1983, as a direct result of GFAVO. The first reference 
facilities were put into operation in 1985-86, their number 
being about 15. The technological development and verification 
took place mainly in 1985 and 1986. The technological 
development and the strong expansion (see Figure 2 [not 
included]) thus occurred mostly in parallel. Operational 
experience over longer time frames were lacking when the 
technology was introduced on a large scale. 
  After 1986 the expansion went rapidly, and at the turn of 
the 
year 1989/90 more than 20,000 MW were equipped with de- 
NO[.sup]x[/] equipment for stack gas cleaning. In 1991 the 
retrofitting program was concluded and today it encompasses 
33,000 MW[.sup]e[/] which translated to more than 130 
facilities at 60 power plants. The emission requirements for 
existing, larger facilities are 200 mg 
NO[.sup]x[/]/m[.sup]3[/] for coal-fired, 150 mg 
NO[.sup]x[/]/m[.sup]3[/] for oil-fired and 100 mg 
NO[.sup]x[/]/m[.sup]3[/] for gas-fired plants. 
  Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia is the most 
common method. The equipment can be placed either directly after 
the furnace (so-called high-dust system) or after the equipment 
for stack gas desulfurization (tail-gas system). 
  During the period from 1985 to 1991 the emission level for 
NO[.sup]x[/] in power production dropped by 75 percent to 
250,000 tons/year. 
  Achieved Results and Costs 
  A common statement regarding West Germany's environmental 
investments in the 1980's was that no country has over such a 
short time accomplished such major environmental improvements. 
On the other hand, no country has invested so much in 
environmental improvement measures as West Germany. 
  Investments for SO[.sup]2[/] purification between the 
years 1983 and 1988 amounted to DM 14 billion at current prices 
and for NO[.sup]x[/] purification between 1985 and 1991 to DM 
7 billion at current prices. The total investments converted 
into Swedish currency, at an exchange rate of 3.6 kronor, are 75 
billion kronor. The cost for the desulfurization program 
totalled the equivalent of 1.3 million kronor per installed MW 
and the de-NO[.sup]x[/] program has cost the equivalent of 
0.8 million kronor per installed MW. 
  From 1983 to 1988, SO[.sup]2[/] emissions from power 
plants dropped by 80 percent and from 1985 to 1991 
NO[.sup]x[/] emissions fell 75 percent, which must be 
regarded as very remarkable cuts. 
  Since government investment contributions have been given to 
a relatively minor extent, the German power consumers have 
mostly had to pay for these environmental improvements by way of 
their electric bills. 
  According to a study conducted by the VDEW (Vereinigte 
Deutsche Elektrizitaets Werke) organization, the specific cost 


    -  of SO[.sup]2[/] purification is 1.3 Pf[ennigs]/kWh 
(4.7 ore/kWh), 
  -  of NO[.sup]x[/] purification 0.8 Pf/kWh (2.9 ore/kWh), 
  -  of dust cleaning 0.4 Pf/kWh (1.4 ore/kWh) and 
  -  of other cleaning 0.4 Pf/kWh (1.4 ore/kWh). 

    The total production cost, according to the example in 
Figure 
3 [not included] (550 MWe, 4,500 h/year) is 13 Pf/kWh (47 
ore/kWh). The total cost for purification, in the above example, 
is 2.9 Pf/kWh (10.4 ore/kWh), but in practice it varies between 
1.5 and 3.5 Pf/kWh (5.4 -12.6 ore/kWh). 
  Since up to 60 percent of the country's production of 
electric power is based on fossil fuels, the additional cost for 
power can be estimated at between 1 and 2 Pf/kWh (3/6-7.2 
ore/kWh). 
  The cost of electricity in western Germany was considerably 
higher than in Sweden even before the strict emission 
regulations were introduced. Today, the households pay 27 Pf/kWh 
(98 ore/kWh) for household electricity and 14 Pf/kWh (50 
ore/kWh) for industrial power, including value-added tax. 
However, the power-intensive industry has special, non-public, 
agreements with a long period of validity. The cost of electric 
power in such agreements is on the order of 10-11 Pf/kWh (35-40 
ore/kWh). (Compare with the price of household electricity in 
Stockholm, which in 1992 is not quite 60 ore/kWh, including 
value-added tax but exclusive of fixed surcharges.) 
  In Western Germany the additional cost for an improved 
environment approaches 10 percent of the cost of electric power 
for ordinary consumers. The "Kohlepfenning" is about eight 
percent of the price of electricity. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  From 1983 to 1991 the equivalent of 75 billion kronor were 
invested in desulfurization and de-NO[.sup]x[/] equipment. 
Over the same period the SO[.sup]2[/] emissions dropped by 80 
percent and NO[.sup]x[/] emissions by 75 percent. The results 
achieved exceeded even the goals established by the authorities. 
This gigantic investment program was controlled by tightening 
the legislation, principally the GFAVO ordinance, which took 
effect in 1983-84. 
  Even before GFAVO took effect, about 15 percent of the 
fossil-fuelled power production had modern desulfurization 
technology, however. The technological development of 
desulfurization technology occurred largely in the 1970's, 
partly with government funding. The technology was therefore up 
to date and there was also no lack of reference facilities. 
Then, when the desulfurization program was initiated on a large 
scale, already known technology was utilized. 
  The development of NO[.sup]x[/] purification looked 
different. NO[.sup]x[/] entered the environmental debate 
later and its introduction has been much more rapid. The first 
reference facilities were put into operation in 1985-86. Over 
this period the technology was further developed and verified. 
During the period 1988-89 NO[.sup]x[/] purification 
facilities corresponding to 14,000 MW[.sup]e[/] were 
installed. Japanese licensing agreements were used. The 
development of and investments in the technology have been quite 
parallel processes. In principle, the technology existed but was 
untested on a large scale. 
  The investments were mainly financed through higher 
electricity prices. Up to 10 percent of the price of electricity 
is related to the environment. The ordinary citizens have 
accepted this, partly because the environmental awareness in 
country grew during the 1980's, and partly because the prices 
for electricity, despite being high, nevertheless represent a 
small part of the total household costs. Electricity prices in 
Germany have further, seen from a historical perspective, always 
been higher than in the rest of the world. 
  Industry has not be hit as hard, perhaps. The 
electricity-intensive industry has special agreements valid for 
long periods and the electricity tariffs have probably not been 
influenced to any major extent by this. The large German 
mechanical engineering industry is also not particularly 
sensitive to the price level for electric power, since it only 
amounts to a few percent of the processing value. 
  It should also be added that the requirement by the 
authorities have been strict and that industry has had to adapt. 
  The public influence during the 1980's, in this case by way 
of legislation, did not bring the technology much further as 
regards desulfurization technology. The techniques were known 
and verified. The legislation forced the investments, however. 
  As for de-NO[.sup]x[/] techniques, there were Japanese 
licensing agreements which had been bought, to be sure, but 
verification of the technology on a large scale (30,000 
MW[.sup]e[/]) was certainly filled with risk. The legislation 
must be regarded as having accelerated the technology of de- 
NO[.sup]x[/] techniques. 
  This case shows a targeted steering which has turned out to 
be very successful. The goals that were established were 
achieved and even exceeded. 
  In some situations the legislation had the opposite effect, 
however, meaning it was an obstacle to new energy technology. 
The legislation, which implies that the "best possible 
technique" must be used, means that one is forced to install the 
new technology in several places. This could in some situations 
have inhibited the development. The German model has also to a 
major extent been to "attach" purification equipment, not to 
improve the combustion process. 
  But one should bear in mind the serious environmental 
situation in which West Germany found itself in the early 
1980's. The strong measures ultimately taken by the government 
were perhaps the only correct way to deal with, or at least 
improve, a serious environmental situation over a relatively 
short period. 
<H5>  3. Bioenergy in Sweden </H5>
  Background 
  In 1973 dramatic price increases and disturbances of the 
international oil trade occurred. The situation was felt in 
Sweden as well, because of the country's major dependence on oil 
and because rationing was undertaken. The first oil crisis was a 
fact. 
  The oil crisis became the starting point for an extensive 
energy research program which was begun in 1975. When the second 
oil crisis occurred, in 1979, the allocation of funds to the 
energy program was intensified. Financial subsidies of 
investments in energy technology aimed at rapidly reducing the 
dependence on oil were introduced. The Oil Replacement Fund, 
established in 1981, acquired a central role. 
  Part of the oil replacement program was the intention to 
convert from oil to biofuels[.sup]19[/]. 
  The oil replacement policy with special emphasis on 
biofuels: 
  In 1974 the Energy Program Committee (EPK) was of the 
opinion 
that biofuels would play a very limited role in the future. Its 
position was that wood and timber waste products are not an 
attractive fuel under normal conditions, since forest products 
have a far higher value as a raw material for fiber. Energy 
forest cultivation could be undertaken on a limited scale, 
however, so that the interests of the forest industry would not 
be threatened. The need for research was evaluated as minor and 
research in the field was given 3 million kronor annually over a 
three-year period. 
  In the first energy policy program of 1975, bioenergy is 
regarded as one alternative among many in the new energy sector. 
Here as well it was believed that bioenergy would have little 
significance. 
  After the nonsocialist government came to power in 1976, the 
importance of bioenergy was clearly marked. Bioenergy was given 
greater importance in the 1977/78 energy draft bill, and the 
funds allocated for research were more than doubled. Then Energy 
Minister Olof Johansson said at the time: "Biomass is, in my 
opinion, one of the most interesting alternatives. Against that 
background, I believe that considerable research and development 
efforts involving energy extraction from biomass are justified. 
The goal of these efforts should be to develop foundations for 
evaluating the opportunities to increase the proportion of 
biomass in the Swedish energy system, and for supporting the 
development of such new technology as is necessary in order to 
utilize the energy content of biomass." It was not only the 
replacement of oil which was the reason for this major interest 
in biofuels. It was also important for the Center Party to find 
credible alternatives to nuclear power. 
  In the 1978/79 energy bill, submitted by the Liberal 
minority 
government, but generally based on the nonsocialist three-party 
government's foundation materials, new guidelines for the energy 
policy are presented. It says here: "Forest waste and hardwood 
qualities which are not needed for the forest industry are a 
domestic and renewable source of energy, which should be 
seriously taken into account when planning the future energy 
supply. It should be possible to introduce the technology on a 
large scale even during the 1980s." 
  New guidelines for energy policy were presented in the 
1980/81 energy bill. There was still major uncertainty about the 
bioenergy field, but the goals/prognoses had been adjusted 
upward compared to earlier prognoses and corresponded to 25-30 
TWh per year for forest fuels, exclusive of forest energy use of 
lyes, bark, etc. Additional increases were expected after 1990, 
when the energy forest program would begin to take effect. A 
large number of efforts were aimed at the development of methods 
and technology for the production and use of biofuels. The 
energy policy did not take just oil replacement into account, 
however. The decision to abolish nuclear power by 2010 was also 
included. 
  One of the preconditions for the 1980/81 energy policy 
decision was the assumption that oil prices would continue to 
climb in real terms by two percent a year for all of the 1980's. 
This could be perceived as a prognosis for the most likely 
development of the oil price, which in turn generates a certain 
volume for the oil replacement. It could also be seen as a 
necessary price development for the oil replacement to achieve 
the planned volume. The assumption of increasing oil prices in 
real terms had the result that comparative calculations for 
various fuels favored the latter. 
  An additional measure which reinforced the introduction of 
biofuels was the solid fuel law, which meant that facilities 
that burned the equivalent of 5,000 m[.sup]3[/] of thick fuel 
oil annually, must be designed so that without major remodeling 
work or supplementation they can burn domestic solid fuel (does 
not apply to areas where distribution of natural gas was 
planned, however). 
  Subsidies for investments in oil-replacement technology were 
provided through the Oil Replacement Fund. Subsidies could also 
be given for establishing marketing organizations for domestic 
fuels. The fund was financed by a surcharge on oil and had about 
600 million kronor a year available. Between 1981 and 1984 the 
fund in various forms subsidized oil replacement at a cost of 
about 1.7 billion kronor. 
  The financial need for expansion of solid-fuel-fired plants 
was also met by the so-called district heating loans. An 
expansion of the district heating grid was expected to take 
place at the rate of 1,000 MW a year throughout the 1980's. 
  Projects Within the Bioenergy Field 
  During the period from 1974 to 1977 the "Whole Tree 
Utilization" project was carried out. Its purpose was to develop 
methods for using weak trees, waste from cutting and stumps. The 
focus was both on greater utilization of forest raw material and 
opportunities to use the forest raw materials in energy 
production. A certain rivalry thus existed between the forest 
industry on the one hand, and those who wanted to use the forest 
as raw material for energy on the other. The contribution from 
research during this period was considerable with regard to 
forest maintenance and cutting, but more limited with regard to 
refining fuel. The project had a budget of about 20 million 
kronor, half of which was government funding and half from the 
forest industry. 
  When the second oil crisis occurred in 1979, the price 
relationship changed rapidly in favor of domestic fuels, not 
just by calculation but also in real terms. There was also no 
conflict with the forest industry concerning raw material, 
partly due to the fact that it was mostly forest waste that was 
to be utilized, and partly because the forest industry had been 
hit by a slump. That the government was more interested in 
establishing a market, among other things, therefore came to be 
an accelerating factor. 
  The view of biofuels, particularly forest fuels, as an 
economically reasonable alternative and supplement became more 
favorable and the use of biofuels for heating purposes increased 
rapidly. However, no commercial link had had time to develop, 
and the use of forest fuels outside the forest industry was thus 
limited up to this period. 
  When the appropriations for bioenergy increased after the 
nonsocialist three-party government came to power, a base of 
knowledge had accumulated with the "Whole Tree Utilization" 
project. Further, resources were available for research and 
study. The appropriations received for the period 1978/79 - 
1980/81 were the equivalent for forest fuels (exclusive of 
energy forest) of about 75 million kronor[.sup]20[/]. A 
number of projects were initiated over the period. They were 
often of a production and development nature. A relatively large 
part of the government support was used to develop organizations 
for production, distribution and commerce with biofuels. 
  In 1976 certain research efforts for an energy forest were 
also initiated. The result of the early efforts indicated a 
considerable cultivation potential for energy forest. In 1978 a 
program was formulated with the goal of having developed 
sufficient knowledge by 1985 to evaluate the production 
capability, economics and possibilities of introduction. The 
costs amounted to 120 million kronor at current prices up to 
1985. Evaluations available in 1985 indicated that the potential 
surface area for energy forest cultivation totals not quite 1 
million hectares. Cultivation tests showed that a production of 
about 15 tons of dry substance per hectare and year would be 
possible in southern Sweden, which would be the equivalent of 
six tons of oil per hectare and year. Since 1985, when the oil 
prices fell, no major efforts have been made in the field of 
energy forest, and commercial introduction has not yet taken 
place. Today there are about 700 hectares of energy forest in 
the country which are still at the experimental stage. 
  In the period 1981/82 to 1983/84, the forest fuel area 
(exclusive of energy forest) was given 145 million kronor, 40 
million kronor of which were for large-scale experiments and 
another 40 million kronor for combustion technology, which also 
included burning other solid fuels (peat, waste, etc.). The 
objective of this program was to eliminate the obstacles which 
existed for the introduction of forest fuels on a large scale. 
What was seen was a beginning "commercialization" of biofuels. 
  The goal of the oil replacement program which was 
established 
in the early 1980s was for coal, domestic fuels and conversion 
to electricity to be responsible for replacing about 9 MToe [not 
further identified] in 1990. As early as 1985 the oil 
replacement would amount to 3.5 Mtoe. 
  During the period 1981-84 the Oil Replacement Fund granted 
investment support, in the form of subsidies for various types 
of loans, for combustion facilities for solid fuel and fuel 
production and refining of biofuels, of approximately 400 
million kronor. The total investment costs in these projects 
were about 1.2 billion kronor. The number of projects amounted 
to nearly 100, of which about half involved "prototype and 
demonstration facilities." As early as the 1970's, however, 
investment funding was provided for biofuel facilities. The 
activity was financed by SIND [State Industry Administration]. 
It merged with the Oil Replacement Fund in 1981. 
  During this period a number of companies and projects were 
established. Some examples are pellets production in Mora, Nydo, 
originally owned by Nynas (later by the Swedish Forest Service) 
and whose purpose was to establish a commercial link for 
biofuels, and Ebenol in Vastergotland, which produced pulverized 
wood. The forest industry was also involved in projects. SCA 
built a forest fuel terminal in Hissmofors and Sodra Skogsagarna 
built one in Vaxjo. During that period furnaces were also 
constructed which could easily be converted to various fuels. In 
1983 about 60 major forest-fuel-fired group centers or 
facilities for district heat production were in existence. About 
15 of them utilized refined forest fuels, such as pulverized 
wood, pellets or briquettes. 
  During that period the Swedish Biofuel Association (SVEBIO) 
was also founded, which has exercised pressure to promote the 
development of the bioenergy field. 
  When the oil price dropped sharply in 1985, despite an 
increase in taxes and surcharges on oil, the previously made 
calculations were complete failures. Many of the "new" companies 
did not have established markets and were not sufficiently 
strong financially to cope with the new situation. What at one 
moment appeared to be foresighted and innovative, appeared to be 
the most expensive alternative the next. 
  The industry's development has definitely been affected by 
the energy policy, not merely by the oil price prognoses but 
also by competition from other forms of energy which were 
government-supported. Electric conversion is one of them and 
other solid fuels, primarily coal, is another. Yet another is 
large heat pumps. 
  One more aspect, which in some cases may have been 
inhibiting 
for the biofuel development, but which should not be unduly 
stressed, is the wood fiber law from the early 1970's. According 
to it, a large combustion plant for wood fuels must be specially 
examined before receiving permission for establishment. The wood 
fiber law ceases to apply in 1993, however. 
  It is interesting to note that the bioenergy industry has 
recovered after the oil price drop and has even grown for heat 
production in municipal thermal power plants. The reason for 
this is that the solid fuel furnaces which were installed in 
recent years have mostly been used for biofuels or were 
converted from other solid fuels to biofuels. The government's 
investment support for the facilities has decreased since 1985, 
however. 
  Biofuels are likely to be the object of debate in the future 
as well, however. Today, a government "biostudy" is under way, 
whose task is to see how the application of biofuels can be 
increased and their competitive ability strengthened without 
conflicting with the forest industry. The study is to be 
completed on 1 July 1991. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  The Swedish energy programs from 1975 to 1985 must be 
regarded as integrated. Bioenergy was only one of several "new" 
sources of energy under consideration. It appeared suitable from 
a political point of view, however, since it was both domestic 
and renewable. 
  When the oil price increased sharply in 1979 and 1980, the 
oil replacement program became the dominant one. The Oil 
Replacement Fund, which began its activity in 1981 facilitated 
the financing of introducing solid fuels, among them biofuels, 
and acquired a central role in biofuel use. 
  At the same time as biofuels became interesting primarily 
from the aspect of replacing oil, the forest industry met with 
worse economic conditions. This had the result that the forest 
industry was more able to accept the use of forest raw materials 
as fuel. In addition, the material removed, at least to begin 
with, involved mainly forest waste, shavings, etc. At the end of 
the 1980's a conflict between the forest industry and the 
biofuel industry once again developed regarding the raw 
material. It should be clear, however, that the material removed 
from the forest which is to be "burned up" is relatively 
limited. The annual growth of the Swedish forest is much greater 
than the annually removed substance, and in the past 20 years 
the biofuel industry has in fact not competed with the forest 
industry for the raw material. 
  A very important component in oil replacement was the 
government's prognoses for the future development of oil prices. 
The assumption was that the oil prices would grow by two percent 
a year in real terms for all of the 1980's. These prognoses were 
produced and, accordingly, interpreted, as political promises. 
The calculations made were based on these "political promises," 
which said that converting from oil to solid fuels, among them 
biofuels, would be profitable within a period of 5-6 years, with 
expectations for a commercial link for biofuels when they were 
established. 
  When the oil price fell sharply in 1985, despite an increase 
in taxes and surcharges on oil, the previously made calculations 
collapsed completely. The price sensitivity of the fuels was too 
great. 
  This case shows that political steering of economic 
parameters can have tremendous consequences if the "free market" 
goes in the direction opposite to the political-economic 
steering. 
  Other aspects which have made introduction of biofuels more 
difficult have been the competition from other forms of energy 
which were also subsidized. For large facilities conversion to 
coal has been an alternative. Another competitor was electric 
conversion, particularly of electricity that could be switched 
off. In absolute numbers, conversion to electricity that could 
be switched off was relatively moderate, but it was concentrated 
to the size of facilities where biofuels are common. 
  The government's efforts in this field, including subsidies 
and financial support for facilities, have totalled 875 million 
kronor at current prices for the period 1975-90, about 700 
million kronor of which was for the period 1975-85. Whether 
these sums are justified or not cannot be unequivocally 
answered. It is likely that a development of know-how took place 
in the field of forest research and in the field of combustion, 
which is worth something. On the other hand, the subsidies for 
"prototype and demonstration facilities" were often based on 
calculations of higher oil prices in real terms and a 
well-functioning market and would probably not have been built 
if the "calculations" had looked different. 
  It is interesting to note that the use of biofuels for heat 
production in municipal thermal power plants grew in the late 
1980's, despite the industry losing strength in the mid-1980's. 
Several factors may explain this. The main reason is, however, 
that many thermal plants with combination furnaces believe it 
makes good economic sense to burn biofuels. This applies 
particularly where there is plenty of forest raw material. 
Indirectly, it is due to the government's means of control, in 
which biofuels receive favorable tax treatment compared with 
fossil fuels. 
  One fact which is likely to be of significance in the future 
is that there is a large surplus of forest and this surplus is 
growing from year to year. The differences between annual growth 
and the annual amount removed is on the order of 30 million 
m[.sup]3[/]. "Burning" some of the surplus ought to be 
correct from a national economic point of view. 
Swedish Nuclear Waste Technology 
  Background 
  The role of nuclear power in the Swedish energy system was a 
very big political issue during the 1970's and represented one 
of the big controversial issues in the 1976 election movement. 
  In particular the nuclear waste issue was discussed, and not 
only in Sweden but in most of the Western nations where nuclear 
power programs were under way. The strict legislation which was 
enacted in the late 1970's was in many respects a reflection of 
the social debate and the political debate conducted regarding 
nuclear waste. 
  Legislation Involving Waste Issues 
  The nonsocialist three-party government, which was formed 
after the 1976 election and dissolved in 1978 due to 
disagreement over the nuclear power issue, in 1977 submitted 
proposals for special permission to add nuclear fuel to a 
nuclear reactor. In April 1977 the Riksdag adopted this law, the 
so-called Law of Conditions [Nuclear Power Plant Law]. The law 
imposes demands for special permission from the government for 
adding nuclear fuel to a reactor for the first time so that 
nuclear fission can take place. Permission is only granted if 
the reactor's owner has presented an agreement which in a safe 
manner meets the requirement for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel 
and, further, has shown each and every way to permanently store 
both reprocessed and non-reprocessed nuclear fuel in complete 
safety. In connection with the origination of the law of 
conditions, the Swedish nuclear power companies organized the 
so-called KBS (nuclear fuel safety) project, with the task of 
studying and reporting on how to meet the requirements of the 
law. 
  In 1981 the so-called Financing Law came into being, which 
meant that the sharing of responsibility between the nuclear 
power companies and the authorities was fixed as regarded 
planning and implementation and financing of the measures 
required for the safe handling of radioactive waste. The nuclear 
power companies are required to submit plans annually for how 
they intend to implement the required measures. 
  In the Nuclear Technology Law from 1984 the owners of the 
Swedish nuclear power plants are obligated to establish a joint, 
versatile program for the research and development activity and 
other measures which are needed to deal with nuclear waste in a 
safe manner, including the future measures to abolish nuclear 
power. The nuclear power companies pay an annual fee based on 
the electric power delivered. 
  The size of this amount is 1.8-2.0 ore per kWh of produced 
nuclear power, which is the equivalent of 10 percent of 
production costs. A total of more than 15 billion kronor have 
been paid into this fund so far. The balance is today 7 billion 
kronor. These funds are administered by the government, in 
addition to a minor portion intended for waste with low and 
medium radioactivity, which is paid by the nuclear power 
companies. The funds receive additional monies, amounting to 
about 1.5 billion kronor a year. The rate of growth in the funds 
is high. 
  Program for Handling and Storing the Nuclear Waste 
  Research on the handling and storage of nuclear waste began 
in Sweden in 1975, in connection with the establishment of the 
Program Council for Radioactive Waste (Prav). 
  The research was intensified in connection with the law of 
conditions. The KBS project was started by the nuclear power 
companies. The project work was administratively tied to Svensk 
Karnbranslehantering AB (SKB), a company owned by Forsmarks 
Kraftgrupp, Oskarshamns Kraftgrupp, Sydsvenska Varmekraft (owned 
by Sydkraft) and Vattenfall. The KBS project developed two 
permanent storage methods, KBS-1 for vitrified, highly 
radioactive waste from reprocessing (1977) and KBS-2 for 
permanent storage of non-reprocessed nuclear fuel (1978). Both 
of these were presented in the form of reports. 
  The KBS-1 report formed the foundation for applications for 
permits to fuel the Ringhals 3 and 4 reactors and Forsmark 1 and 
2. The government granted permission for fueling in 1979 and 
1980, respectively. The KBS-2 report has not been used in any 
application for permit to fuel. 
  The high cost of reprocessing in combination with low 
uranium 
prices reduced the motive for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel in 
both the short and the medium term. For countries such as 
Sweden, with relatively limited nuclear power programs, an 
"open" nuclear fuel cycle with direct permanent storage, without 
previous reprocessing, therefore seemed the best alternative 
from an economic aspect. 
  In 1983 SKB presented a new report on permanent storage of 
spent nuclear fuel. The report was based on the same method as 
was described in KBS-2, but the new report, KBS-3, is based on 
broader and deeper knowledge bases. 
  The KBS-3 report was the basis for the fuel permissions for 
the Forsmark 3 and Oskarshamn 3 reactors. The government granted 
such permissions according to the new nuclear technology law of 
June 1984. The permission was also founded on a research program 
worked out by SKB in February 1984. 
  The KBS-3 report describes how a system for safe, permanent 
dealing with Swedish nuclear fuel can be designed based on the 
level of knowledge in 1982/83. The report deals with all 
handling, transportation, storage and treatment which is 
necessary for creating safe permanent storage of spent nuclear 
fuel. The government accepted the report after extensive 
opinions had been sought in Sweden and internationally in 1984, 
which meant that it believed the accounting met the safety 
requirements of the nuclear technology law. Since then, SKB has 
conducted broad research on conceivable questions tied to 
geological storage in Sweden. No decision has been made as yet 
about where and precisely how permanent storage of spent nuclear 
fuel is to take place. SKB's planning presumes that the required 
material for making the decision about the most suitable method 
and sites will be available in 1993. The necessary studies are 
calculated to take 2-3 years and will be followed by detailed 
studies up to the turn of the century. After that, the 
suitability of the final site will be confirmed. 
  An important element of this work is the studies and 
analyses 
which have been done since 1986 at a research station built into 
the mountain in the vicinity of the Oskarshamn plant on the 
Simpevarp peninsula, for the purpose of demonstrating 
technology, of studying mountains and describing in calculations 
the various protective functions. 
  The Swedish system is based on intermediate storage of the 
spent fuel for 30-40 years. The advantage of this is that its 
temperature and radioactivity decrease considerably. Today, this 
is done at an intermediate storage facility for spent fuel in 
Oskarshamn, CLAB (Central Storage for Spent Fuel). CLAB consists 
of a protected subterranean site excavated into the mountain, in 
which the spent fuel is handled and stored in water-filled 
basins. The facility has been in operation since 1985 and more 
than 1,500 tons of fuel are stored there today. CLAB has cost 
1.7 billion kronor at today's prices. 
  Operating waste from the nuclear power plants is even today 
permanently stored in a facility for low and medium radioactive 
waste at Forsmark, SFR (Permanent Storage of Radioactive Waste). 
SFR was inaugurated in 1988 and was built under the sea about 60 
meters below the bottom of the sea. The facility consists of a 
number of rock caverns shaped to fit various types of waste. SFR 
has cost 750 million kronor at today's prices. 
  The costs of building CLAB were taken from the money in the 
funds, while SFR has mainly been paid for by the nuclear power 
companies. 
  SKB has developed, planned and built the facilities and 
today 
has the main responsibility for operating them, which is carried 
out under contract by OKG for CLAB and by Vattenfall at Forsmark 
for SFR. 
  SKB is also in charge of the research and development 
activity on permanent storage of the spent fuel. 
  The Nuclear Technology Law obligates the nuclear power 
companies to establish a joint, versatile program for research 
and development involving nuclear waste. SKB has worked out the 
programs which are submitted to the Government Nuclear Fuel 
Board (SKN) and the government every third year beginning in 
1986. 
  SKN originated from PRAV, which was abolished in connection 
with adoption of the financing law in 1981. Further, SKN is the 
authority which is charged with overseeing and monitoring SKB's 
activity in the nuclear waste field. SKB's, and thus the nuclear 
power companies', R&amp;D in the nuclear waste field annually 
amounts to more than 150 million kronor. 
  Today's R&amp;D activity in the waste sector is partly 
aimed at a 
final supplementation of the data base for evaluation of 
long-range safety before choosing the protective system and 
site, partly at a practical reevaluation of the methods for 
detailed studies of the chosen site under realistic conditions. 
The development of methods and access to data for evaluating the 
long-range safety of deep geological storage and data access has 
been brought to a level which enables the start of a 
site-finding process during the 1990's. 
  The Nordic authorities for nuclear safety and radiation 
protection are presently working on developing joint 
recommendations for the design of specific acceptance criteria 
for deep storage for permanent storage of long-lived waste. 
  Internationally, Sweden is well placed as regards handling 
nuclear waste. The completed activities, including projection 
and construction of CLAB, SFR and the transportation system, 
have totalled 8 billion kronor at today's prices since the 
mid-1970's. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  The nuclear waste issue became a major political 
controversial issue during the 1970's. Seen from this 
perspective, the creation of the Law of Conditions was logical. 
  The Law of Conditions, with its demands for absolute safety, 
led to a concentration on redundantly safe systems. From a 
technical and economic aspect it may be discussed whether such a 
development was justified. On the other hand, it was necessary 
to invest in techniques and systems which one believed had the 
confidence of the general public and the politicians. The 
efforts in the area of waste in the late-1970's and 1980's were 
made in this spirit, although there were occasionally loud 
protests among the technicians. 
  Compared to the values involved in the political 
considerations, the costs of investing in extremely high safety 
in the nuclear waste sector have nevertheless been reasonable. 
  Internationally, Sweden has come a long way as regards the 
technology of nuclear waste handling. This is a result, among 
others, of the nation's rigorous legislation, which led to 
intensive research and technology development in the field of 
nuclear waste from 1977 and on, and well-functioning cooperation 
and express willingness to solve problems among the nuclear 
power companies responsible. 
  In the general debate it is often said that the "highest 
possible safety" must be ensured. Strict application of such an 
objective could result in the protective systems never being 
built, since each solution presented can always be made even 
safer. In the nuclear technology law the government has never 
quantified any risk level that could be regarded as acceptable, 
but indicates that storage should take place in a way that is 
acceptable with regard to safety and radiation protection. 
  At present not quite two ore per nuclear kWh produced is set 
aside, which corresponds with a total of about 1.5 billion 
kronor a year. Of these funds, about 1 billion are kept in the 
fund, and the money in the funds will increase rapidly in future 
years. The money is earmarked for its purpose in a detailed 
manner by the financing law. 
  Thus, it is possible to state that technical solutions for 
the permanent storage of nuclear waste have been presented, that 
the establishment of the data material for the choice of site 
and system is almost complete, and that methods for evaluating 
the long-range safety of buried storage are available. It can 
also be stated that society's acceptance requirements are in the 
process of being formalized, so that a process for choice of 
system and site selection can be started during the 1990's. The 
money for this has been set aside in a fund and is added to 
annually in order to pay for the future permanent expansion of 
the necessary facilities. 
<H5>  5. The Development of Heat Pumps in Sweden </H5>
  Introduction and Summary 
  The heat pump had a breakthrough in the late 1970's and 
since 
then has enjoyed rapid spreading across a broad application 
field [.sup]21[/]. The distribution was particularly fast in 
the early 1980's, when certain sub-markets, such as heat pumps 
in large district heating systems, were developed from 
introduction to saturation in just a few years. The majority of 
market segments underwent a very sharp decline in 1985-86. A 
certain recovery, above all in the absolutely lowest efficiency 
segment, has taken place over the last 3-4 years. 
  Heat pumps can be divided into three categories: 


    -  Small heat pumps, mainly for heating homes, 
  -  medium-sized heat pumps for multifamily dwellings, and 
  -  large heat pumps in district heating systems or industry. 

    The largest number of heat pumps is of the small 
type. Large heat pumps are responsible for the completely 
dominating part of the energy production and energy 
saving. 
  The development of various partial markets has differed. 
Small home heat pumps consist of two partial markets, the 
conversion market and the new construction market. The 
conversion market took off in 1979, was at its largest in 1984 
and then disappeared almost completely. The new construction 
market took off in 1980 and since then has had a rather stable 
position of about 50 percent of new production, with a certain 
slump during the period 1986-88. Medium-sized heat pumps never 
achieved the same market penetration, but the market development 
has been relatively stable, with the exception of a slump in the 
mid-1980s. The market for large heat pumps emerged and developed 
strongly during the period 1982-85. Sales peaked in 1986, after 
which the market was in principle saturated, and few large heat 
pumps have been sold since then. 
  Subsidies for R&amp;D on heat pumps has been provided, 
partly by 
way of the energy research program since 1978, and partly 
through Vattenfall's Solar Project during the period 1979-1987. 
The government's and Vattenfall's efforts, respectively, have 
been about equally large (300-400 million kronor each at the 
1989 monetary value). Furthermore, up to and including 1984 
there was a direct government market introduction and investment 
subsidy of a total of 1,202 billion kronor[.sup]22[/] (at 
today's monetary value). The heat pump has also been indirectly 
favored since for new construction it was included in the basic 
loan amount for government loans.[.sup]23[/] 
  The predominant part of the above funding went to small heat 
pumps. Medium-sized heat pumps were mostly covered by the same 
subsidy regulations as small ones, but due to the low market 
penetration the payments were relatively small. Large heat pumps 
did not, with a few exceptions, receive government subsidies. 
  The R&amp;D support which has been given, by the government 
and 
by Vattenfall, has been of limited importance for the 
development of technology. On the other hand, the subsidies were 
important in order to develop know-how, evaluation materials and 
interest in heat pump technology. Vattenfall's solar project, in 
particular, was held up by many experts as important in this 
respect. 
  The investment support is likely to have been of major 
importance for the rapid spread of fluid/water heat pumps in the 
conversion market until 1984. The elimination of the support in 
1985 was also, together with the drop in oil prices and the 
beginnings of market saturation, of crucial importance for the 
very fast decline of the market. 
  In the new construction market for small heat pumps the 
government loans have been of major significance for the 
penetration. This has, in combination with the housing 
manufacturers' desire to reduce the number of housing types, 
been a decisive factor in the equipment of all newly constructed 
small homes with air-to-air heat pumps. 
  For medium-sized heat pumps, the government contributions 
have been of considerably less importance. The information and 
education programs which were developed are likely to have had 
some importance for the quality of installations and maintenance. 
  The breakthrough of large heat pumps was essentially 
market-driven, and government involvement had a marginal 
importance on the development. 
  The Development of the Market 
  Heat pumps can be divided into three size classes, and the 
market development is described in Figures 1-3 [not included]. 
  Since the market development has differed between various 
segments, the four principal segments are discussed here: small 
heat pumps--conversion as well as new production, medium-sized 
heat pumps and large heat pumps. 
<H5>  The Market for Small Heat Pumps: </H5>
  The market for small heat pumps is divided into two segments 
with completely different opportunities, the conversion market 
and the new production market. 
  Up to 1985 the conversion market was most important. Typical 
installations were ground heating facilities for older houses 
with water-based heating systems and relatively large heating 
requirements. After 1985 installations of air-to-air heat pumps 
of up to 3 kW in newly constructed small homes have dominated 
completely until 1989. Thus, about half of all small homes are 
today built with air-to-air heat pumps as standard equipment. In 
individual cases somewhat larger heat pumps of the stone or 
surface earth heating type are also installed. Figure 4 shows 
the number of heat pump installations from 1983 to 1990.

  The manufacture and sale of home heat pumps in Sweden was 
established at the end of the 1970's. In the conversion segment 
sales grew slowly in the last years of the 1970's, and in 1979 a 
drastic increase occurred in connection with the second oil 
crisis. The boom continued, stimulated by various types of 
government loans and subsidies, up to and including 1984. 
  The market upturn in some cases led to problems which gave 
the heat pump a bad reputation. Technically, the pumps were 
usually of good quality. The mistakes which were made involved 
chiefly the connection to and cooperation with existing systems 
in small and medium-sized facilities, and with respect to 
maintenance and operation of these installations. 
  The "gold fever" and the subsequent free fall led to may 
players emerging and then disappearing. The companies which were 
the first manufacturers of home heat pumps in Sweden were 
development-oriented large companies in the heating, ventilation 
and sanitary industry [VVS]. Later, businesses oriented toward 
electrical equipment and cooling also got involved in heat 
pumps. They were more intent on assembly and sales. When the 
sales were at their peak and profitability high, there were also 
a number of businesses, such as auto dealers, which did not have 
a past in a related industry. According to estimates by the 
Swedish Heat Pump Association, the industry employed 3,000 
persons in 1983. A year later more than 5,000 persons were 
employed, while at the end of 1985 employment was down to 1,900 
persons. 
  In the new construction market sales took off a year later 
with the 1980 building standard which provided financial 
advantages for energy-saving construction. The market upturn as 
well as the slump in the mid-1980's was less strong. The same 
problems also did not occur with the installations as in the 
conversion segment. This is probably due in part to the easier 
installation, in part to the more professional buyer category. 
<H5>  Medium-Sized Heat Pumps </H5>
  The potential for medium-sized heat pumps in multifamily 
dwellings and premises is larger, in terms of output, than the 
market for small heat pumps; there is the potential for between 
5,000 and 10,000 installations alone outside the district 
heating regions. On the whole, the development within the 
segment has been considerably slower and more stable than in the 
home segment, and neither a crucial breakthrough nor a drastic 
decline have occurred.[.sup]25[/] 
  The customer category in this segment is, unlike the home 
segment, professional building managers. They have had a more 
cautious attitude toward the heat pump. The installation costs 
were regarded as high in comparison with normal building 
maintenance. The economic competitiveness of the heat pumps 
compared with the alternatives was not convincing; there was not 
enough know-how to maintain the heat pumps, and less serious 
suppliers in the mid-1980's gave the heat pump a bad reputation 
among building managers. Also, a direct ban on heat pumps exists 
in some district heating areas. 
  There was no overestablishment on the manufacturing side 
either, such as the one for small heat pumps. One important 
reason for many manufacturers avoiding this segment of the 
market could be that it is split, meaning that a large number of 
sizes are involved, from series-manufactured facilities to 
larger custom-built ones. 
  The future market potential in this segment is still large 
and the development is nowadays, when the technology has 
"matured," likely to rest on the future development of oil 
prices. 
<H5>  Large Heat Pumps </H5>
  The large heat pumps are an example of a very rapid and 
effective introduction and establishment of a technology. Today, 
about 100 large heat pumps have been installed. The majority of 
these were built in the years 1982-1986. After 1986 only a few 
facilities were built. This is in part due to the sharply 
decreasing oil price, but is primarily because the majority of 
potential heat sources have already been exploited. These heat 
pumps provide an important addition to the country's energy 
supply and are responsible for approximately 15 percent of the 
district heat in the country. 
  The rapid introduction of large heat pumps is a result of 
the 
high price of oil, the relatively low price of electricity, well 
developed district heating, good access to lake water and 
purified waste water, and, above all, a highly industrial 
network on the side of both the seller and the buyer. 
Development, manufacture and purchasing have been demanded and 
undertaken by players with a great deal of expertise. 
  There have been few equipment manufacturers. The development 
of the technology took place in cooperation between Sulzer in 
Switzerland and ASEA STAL. The turbo compressor was developed by 
Sulzer, while Stal arranged the greater part of the remaining 
components. In all, ASEA STAL[.sup]26[/] was responsible for 
about 75 percent of the market. From the beginning the 
manufacturers had the know-how to deliver turnkey technology 
with operating guarantees, which is why no significant 
difficulties occurred with the installations, such as those for 
small and medium-sized facilities. 
  On the technology buyer side were municipalities, which 
controlled the heat basis and waste water systems and with a 
professional corps of technicians was rapidly able to see the 
potential of the technology. In several cases there were 
predictions, which turned out to be correct, of repayment 
periods of approximately two years for the facilities. The 
investment decisions were further facilitated by the fact that 
the technology was perceived by local politicians as 
environmentally friendly and energy-saving and in line with the 
national energy policy. 
  The biggest problem with getting the development under way 
seems to have been to demonstrate that the technology functioned 
in practice and was reliable. ASEA STAL undertook this task by 
building a test facility under its own direction in Finspang and 
then a lake-water heat pump for ASEA Ludvika. The next step was 
a full-scale facility in Vasteras, after which ASEA began to 
offer facilities with guarantees to the municipalities and they 
dared put in the orders. 
  The Government Subsidies to the Heat Pump Field 
  Government subsidies for heat pumps have been given in 
various forms since 1975. The main interest in the technology 
field came after the 1979 oil crisis. The subsidy can be divided 
into three parts, one, traditional R&amp;D support, two, the 
occasionally very extensive market introduction and investment 
support, and, three, the major information and education 
activity which existed at times. 
  R&amp;D Support: 
  Altogether, during the period 1975-1990 about 300 million 
kronor (in 1989 prices) from the energy research program was 
invested in R&amp;D involving heat pumps. This can be compared 
with, 
for example, solar energy during the corresponding period, which 
received 1.15 billion kronor. The direct government R&amp;D 
support 
within the framework of the energy research program was thus 
remarkably extensive. The comparison will be wrong, however, 
unless it is also taken into account that during the 1979-1987 
period Vattenfall invested a total of 350 million kronor (475 
million kronor at 1979 prices) in its so-called Solar Project. 
About 80 percent of these funds was spent on heat pump projects. 
The emphasis of the solar project was on building demonstration 
facilities. 
  Vattenfall's effort should be viewed against the background 
of the 1979 parliamentary decision for a strong focus on R&amp;D 
in 
order to make solar energy commercially available for heating 
purposes[.sup]27[/], whereby the state authorities presumed 
that Vattenfall took an active part in the work. 
  Investment Support: 
  The majority of the direct government contributions to the 
heat pump field have been for market introduction and investment 
support. From 1979 to 1983 investment subsidies were granted 
within the so-called energy budgeting program amounting to about 
950 million kronor, administered by the Housing Administration. 
During 1984 STEV [not further identified] and the Housing 
Administration were jointly in charge of the so-called 1984 
Investment Program, Contributions to the Installation of 
Heating, etc., in which 252 million kronor was for heat pump 
installations. 
  The greater part of the government's help to the heat pump 
sector went to small heat pumps. In 1979 the first subsidy for 
installations of home heat pumps was given. It was a maximum of 
3,000 kronor and was replaced in 1981 by the Energy Loan 
Ordinance, which involved a five-year exemption from interest 
for one-third of the overall cost of a heat pump. One year later 
the terms were improved to a 10-year interest-free loan. This 
was in effect until 1984, when it was replaced by a 15 percent 
contribution to installations. After 1985, all direct support 
for installation of home heat pumps was eliminated. 
  Air-to-air heat pumps were not included in the above 
support, 
since they were regarded as competitive anyway. Indirectly, 
however, the new production was supported by the fact that the 
1980 building standard provides advantages for construction with 
low energy requirements, so that heat pumps could be financed 
with interest-guaranteed government loans. 
  Medium-sized heat pumps were largely included in the same 
type of subsidies as the small. Since relatively few such pumps 
were installed, despite the subsidy, only a small proportion of 
the total contribution was for this market segment. 
  Large heat pump installations have mainly been undertaken 
without subsidies. From 1983 to 1984, however, some 
installations received investment contributions from the State 
Energy Board and Vattenfall. 
  Information Activity: 
  In parallel with the R&amp;D and investment support which 
was 
granted, above all BFR, Vattenfall and the VVS- [heating, 
ventilation and sanitary industry] Technical Association took 
initiatives for an education program on the installation and 
maintenance of heat pump systems. The purpose of these programs 
was partly to provide information about the heat pump and partly 
to improve the quality of installations and maintenance, where 
several problems had occurred with small and medium-sized heat 
pumps. 
  These education programs were significant in raising the 
level of know-how in the industry. Unfortunately, a large part 
of the market disappeared at the same time as one began to 
master the technology commercially, which is why it was not 
possible to derive full benefit from these education efforts. 
  During the first half of the 1980's there were also 
municipal 
so-called energy advisers. Providing information about the heat 
pump became a principal task for them, since the investment 
contributions for installation of a heat pump was one of the 
very few concrete measures available. 
  Effects of the Government Support 
  On the technology development side, the government's R&amp;D 
support had a limited impact, according to several studies. It 
was essentially market-driven, although the government's support 
(including Vattenfall's Solar Project) is likely to have further 
accelerated the market introduction. 
  On the other hand, the investment support and information 
activity about heat pumps have been important for the market 
development. This applies particularly to the small heat pumps. 
<H5>  Small Heat Pumps--The Conversion Market </H5>
  In the conversion market the state support has been of 
crucial importance for the rapid breakthrough in the early 
1980's. The support naturally meant that more facilities were 
profitable. Further, the calculations were often based on 
prognoses of an official nature which indicated that the oil 
price would continue to rise by about two percent a year, 
calculated in terms of real monetary value, for the foreseeable 
future. The subsidy also meant that some of the investments were 
moved up (above all in 1984), so that it was possible to take 
advantage of it before it ceased. 
  During the 1970's there were also rapid shifts in attitudes. 
Thus, for some years wood furnaces were sold in large amounts, 
after which came electric cartridges and electric cassettes and 
then gradually heat pumps. These fluctuations were largely due 
to the form of the government's contributions and subsidies. The 
state support meant an approval for private persons that society 
had confidence in the technology. The same happened when the 
subsidy stopped. Many felt that this was because society 
regretted its investment in heat pumps, which is why the 1975 
slump was very steep. 
  The municipal advisers were also important for the major 
success of the heat pump in the conversion market. Through this 
investment support, they had something concrete to offer 
property owners beyond good advice and inspection protocols. 
<H5>  Small Heat Pumps--New Production: </H5>
  In this field as well the government efforts, primarily the 
1980 building standard, have had influence on the market 
penetration. It has been about 50 percent for close to a decade 
now. That the development has been relatively stable can be 
explained by the fact that the market space in the new 
construction segment is not as much as the conversion segment 
governed by the relationship between electricity and oil prices, 
but also by variations in new production and by the interest of 
the professional customer group in standardizing its production. 
The fact that government subsidies were more stable during this 
period, in the form of the state loans, probably also 
contributed to the more stable development. 
<H5>  Medium-Sized Heat Pumps: </H5>
  In general, the same types of support were granted to 
medium-sized heat pumps as to small heat pumps. But this support 
had a considerably lower impact on the development. The 
incentives for the intended customers were usually so minor that 
they were not reinforced by subsidy measures to any significant 
extent. 
  The more professional customer group, compared to the 
conversion market, probably imposed greater economic and 
functional demands on the installations, with the result that 
the state support did not create a corresponding "boom" in this 
segment. When the technology was completed and tested in 
practice, the favorable contributions were no longer available. 
  The government impact which occurred in this segment can 
instead mainly be traced to the education and information 
efforts which were undertaken. These are likely to have had a 
positive influence[.sup]28[/] on both the number of 
installations and the quality of the installations. 
<H5>  Large Heat Pumps: </H5>
  As was mentioned earlier, the market introduction in this 
segment was primarily market-driven. Government efforts 
(including Vattenfall's Solar Project) therefore had no decisive 
effect on the development, other than possibly to speed up the 
introduction somewhat. 
  The government's greatest impact on this development is 
likely to have been through its influence on the oil price 
development. On the international market, the oil price began to 
fall in 1982-83. The effects of this price drop were not noticed 
on the Swedish market until 1985, however, because higher taxes 
and the rising dollar exchange rate compensated for the drop in 
world market price. At the same time the Swedish price of 
electricity fell further during these years in connection with 
more nuclear power reactors entering production. This 
development, in which the state was a principal player, further 
reinforced the competitiveness of big heat pumps, of course, and 
accelerated their market introduction. 
<H5>  6. Energy Consulting at the Regional Development Funds </H5>
  When the government's efforts in the field of energy were 
initiated after the first oil crisis in 1973/74, they were 
intended to reduce the country's dependence on oil. Parts of the 
responsibility for reducing industrial energy consumption fell 
to the National Industry Administration (SIND). To begin with, 
the efforts involved information and advice on energy 
conservation measures to small and medium-sized companies, which 
are a very heterogeneous group. The group includes the nations' 
small enterprises, and it was thought that there was relatively 
little knowledge of rational energy use within the group, which 
is why it was considered essential to inform about energy 
conservation opportunities. 
  The energy consulting began in 1977 and was concluded in 
1987. During this period about 6,500 companies were visited, and 
for more than 3,500 of them a large survey was undertaken, a so- 
called preliminary inventory. SIND's total appropriations during 
the period amounted to 74 million kronor in today's prices. 
Furthermore, Vattenfall contributed 3 million kronor for the 
1986/87 fiscal year. The large allocation of funds took place 
over the period 1981/82 to 1985/86, an average of 12 million 
kronor per fiscal year. 
  The orientation of the activity varied somewhat over this 
period. From having had the character of information-carrier, 
the activity in part changed to include consultation and advice 
aimed at the companies' undertaking energy saving measures and 
thereby becoming more profitable in the long run. After that 
followed a period when the companies were helped to achieve 
energy savings, establish know-how and improve operation and 
maintenance, etc. Toward the end of the period the activity was 
aimed at developing decision materials for energy savings which 
the enterprises themselves can continue. From 1977 to 1984 the 
efforts were mostly aimed at saving oil, and in recent years 
more toward greater electricity efficiency. 
  SIND's participation was of a coordinating nature. The 
actual 
energy consulting was carried out in part by the energy 
consultants of the development funds themselves, in part by 
hired consultants, whereby the efforts were roughly evenly 
distributed between the fund's own energy consultants and hired 
consultants. 
  The activity was primarily free of charge. Certain attempts 
at paying for it with fees were made but did not turn out very 
well, which was mostly because utilization of consultants is low 
within the group of small and medium-sized firms and the cost of 
consulting is considered high. 
  Energy Consultants at the Regional Development 
Funds 
  In 1975 SIND was given the task of providing information 
about energy saving contributions by way of the enterprise 
associations, a predecessor for the regional development funds. 
Funding was allocated for education, information and courses in 
the field of heating. The goal was to reduce oil consumption. 
Over the next two years SIND was charged with providing 
information on the potential for saving energy, principally for 
heating but also process-oriented measures, which could save 
energy. The activity was undertaken in the form of seeking-out 
activity. An actual target group was not defined. The companies 
which were interested got help. 
  In 1977 the enterprise associations' personnel, which often 
consists of energy-and VVS-trained civil engineers, was trained 
in the subject of energy for three days. After that, the right 
to decide applications for energy conservation subsidies of up 
to 50,000 kronor was delegated to the enterprise associations. 
The idea was to achieve smoother handling of energy conservation 
funding. Further, in 1977 tests were started with a "free energy 
consultant" in three provinces. About 1,000 companies in the 
three provinces were given energy consultations of half or one 
day each. The activity was primarily to seek them out. The 
intent was for these firms then to apply for energy conservation 
subsidies and thus carry out energy-saving measures. But only 
about eight percent of the companies visited applied for energy 
conservation subsidies within a year. In 1978 the "free energy 
consultant" activity was expanded to include all provinces. 
  In 1978 an industry-specific energy consultant activity was 
also begun. There was cooperation with STU [Administration for 
Technical Development] and Linkoping Technical College, among 
others. The wood product, rubber and foundry industry were also 
targets, among others. Relatively few companies were visited, 
and the potential for saving energy at the firms visited was 
judged at an average of 20 percent. 
  After 1980 a gradual addition of energy consultants took 
place in all provinces. In this phase the activity was developed 
to include an annual budget of 10-15 million kronor. The 
seeking-out activity continued. Visits were undertaken which 
changed into preliminary inventories as to whether a 
sufficiently large energy saving potential could be found. 
Visits to individual firms were usually carried out at the 
initiative of the individual company. On the other hand, the 
industry-specific surveys were active efforts. 
  The energy consultants also undertook a number of so-called 
special projects, in which it may be questioned in some cases 
whether their tasks were not outside the field. Among other 
things, they participated in introducing solid fuel combustion 
and worked with issues involving mini-power plants and wind 
power. In one example the energy consultant was involved in 
development and installation of a new type of wind power 
generator. 
  Together with external consultants, PC-based program 
software 
has been developed for profitability calculations of energy 
budget measures and the development of certain measuring 
equipment, such as energy data meter for storage of measurement 
data and an air flow meter for low air speeds. 
  It was determined in the 1983/84 budget bill that the 
activity should continue to the same extent as over the past two 
years, but that the appropriations must be reduced. Attempts at 
financing with fees were once again made, which worked poorly, 
in accordance with the previous evaluation. In 1986 the 
appropriations were sharply cut back from 13 million kronor for 
the 1985/86 fiscal year to 4 million kronor for the 1986/87 
fiscal year. Vattenfall contributed 3 million kronor for the 
1986/87 fiscal year within the framework of its Task 2000 
project, which is aimed at making electricity use more efficient 
and reduce the demand for electric power. After that, the 
activity ceased. 
  When the subsidies were removed, the activity largely 
disappeared, and today energy consultants remain only in 
Jonkoping province. Another few are left but they also work with 
other issues. The fact that the activity disappeared so quickly 
was mainly due to two factors: There was no actual market for 
these services, and the energy savings that can be undertaken 
today are primarily for greater efficiency, so that considerably 
larger resources are needed both to survey them and to change 
them. 
  Two independent evaluations of the activity have been made: 
by SIAR [Foundation for Research on Enterprise Administration] 
in 1984 and by AF [Steam Boiler Association] in 1988. Both of 
them are of the opinion that the project was relatively 
successful, but that one should have concentrated on fewer 
companies in a few industries which would have been interesting 
from the aspect of energy. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  The original idea was to provide small and medium-sized 
companies with information about energy-saving measures, 
primarily oil savings. With information at hand, one would then 
act rationally, that is to say undertake measures to save 
energy. This did not happen. The reasons are many. One of them 
is that many small and medium-sized firms regard the cost of 
energy as a "fixed" cost and it rarely exceeds two percent of 
turnover, at a mechanical engineering industry, for example. 
Another aspect is that smaller companies are not always 
organized or receptive to detect and undertake potential 
savings. Further, in many cases these firms have no experience 
with consultants, and a service whose value cannot be 
demonstrated without being able to show concrete proof of 
potential savings must be marketed and sold. 
  Information alone was not sufficient to get the industry to 
save energy, although the information in itself was good. The 
information, combined with a visit or preliminary inventory 
would achieve a good result. It also turned out that simple 
measures with regard to insulation, ventilation, industrial 
gates, etc. achieved considerable savings, primarily oil 
savings. In those cases where larger and more costly measures 
were to be carried out, the result was poorer. 
  The independent evaluation which was made in 1984 judged the 
energy conservation potential in small and medium-sized 
enterprises to be 15-20 percent for measures with a payoff time 
shorter than three years. For the entire target group, it would 
give a possible profitability potential of 5-7 TWh/year. 
Investments with payoff times of up to three years are probably 
too big, if the energy costs are only a few percent of the total 
expenses in a company. 
  A problem with projects of this type is that it is more 
difficult to evaluate them in economic terms, because it is hard 
to measure the effects of undertaken measures. As an information 
campaign for energy-saving, however, the project is likely to 
have been of significance and must be regarded as successful. 
  If this project was merely a link in the government's 
information campaign for energy conservation, the project 
succeeded well. 
  If, on the other hand, the objectives were to achieve 
certain 
results, one should have aimed more at relatively energy- 
intensive industries, which is also the opinion of the 
independent evaluations. The campaigns that were aimed at 
energy-intensive industries showed good results. 
  The accepted view of the energy sector was that the efforts 
were effective. Whether or not the effects corresponded to the 
resources spent cannot be unequivocally answered. On this point 
opinions differ. 
<H5>  7. Efficient Electricity Consumption in the United States </H5>
  Background 
  As early as the 1970's certain U.S. power companies on the 
west coast were forced to rethink their plans for electric power 
production. Increases in demand had previously been met by 
expanding production capacity. In the future, this would not be 
quite as easy. New investments could often become so expensive 
that in the long term it would not be possible to get back the 
actual costs of producing electricity. The future uncertainty in 
the fuel market, primarily the oil market, further reinforced 
that picture. During the period 1975-82 the price of electricity 
grew very sharply, by an average of 15 percent a year in real 
terms. Opinions opposed to new construction of facilities also 
began to grow, and it could be difficult to receive permits for 
new construction. The legislation in the energy-producing field 
in the United States is complex and the market is thus tightly 
regulated. It has also taken a long time to complete and put 
into operation certain of the nuclear power plants, which began 
to be built in the United States in the 1970's. 
  With these assumptions, the power companies asked themselves 
whether it were not possible to influence the demand for 
electric power. This is how the Demand-Side Management concept 
or DSM was born. In Swedish one could translate DSM as 
regulating the demand for electric power. 
  In the 1980's DSM has been further developed and spread to 
the east coast as well. Today there are hundreds of DSM programs 
all across the United States, which in various ways try to 
affect the demand for electric power according to the desired 
profile. The DSM concept is also being developed toward a 
unified view of energy production, in which both economic and 
environmental aspects are illuminated. This further development 
is often called Integrated Resource Planning (IRP). DSM has 
today become generally accepted in the United States and is 
expected to be needed in most states during the 1990's. 
  The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), a research 
organization financed by the private power companies in the 
United States, is of the opinion that DSM programs can reduce 
the need for electricity by up to five percent by the year 2000 
and, consequently, carbon dioxide emissions by up to 5-7 
percent. One reason for continued implementation of DMS programs 
in the 1990's is environmental, such as carbon dioxide emissions 
and other emissions with environmental impact. Another reason is 
that many power companies are expected to reach, or have already 
reached, maximum output during peak load, and by reducing the 
peaks there is no need to invest in new power. One thinks in 
terms of "avoided cost." The value of a saved kW in a peak load 
situation can then be great. Yet another aspect is that in many 
cases DSM has turned out to involve lower power costs for the 
customers and it has therefore worked out favorably for 
continued activities. 
  In the 1980's the DSM programs mostly included for example 
energy-saving measures, discounts of various kinds, which are 
aimed at utilizing energy-saving equipment, load control, 
information, marketing and, in certain cases, even more 
far-reaching cooperation between manufacturer and supplier 
regarding energy-efficient equipment and technology. DSM 
programs have occurred in both the housing sector and the 
industrial sector. There has been great inventiveness. 
  The profitability of the DMS projects has varied due, among 
other things, to the fact that they were often undertaken for 
experimental purposes. Figure 1 [not included] shows the 
development of DSM programs from 1977 to 1988. 
  At the end of the 1980's, however, the DSM efforts slackened 
in some states, above all on the west coast. One of the reasons 
was that it has been advantageous to build smaller power plants 
and sell electricity to the regulated power companies, and 
therefore there did not seem to be the same need for greater 
efficiency as before. On the east coast, however, the DSM 
efforts have remained at a high level, since a lack of power has 
threatened the whole time. 
  In the last few years DSM has once again become interesting. 
From 1989 to 1991 the power companies' spending on DSM has grown 
from an average of 1.6 to 2.3 percent of total sales. The 
foremost cause of this is, as was mentioned earlier, 
environmental reasons, the possibility of not having to invest 
in new power and acceptance from the customers. 
  Examples of DSM Programs in the United States 
  Below are given some examples of DSM programs undertaken in 
the United States during the 1970's and 1980's. 
<H5>  Seattle City Light </H5>
  Seattle City Light (SCL) is a "municipal" company, which is 
responsible for the production of electric power and electric 
power distribution in the Seattle area. Its capacity is about 
2,100 MW and sales are about 260 million dollars annually. 
  In the early 1970's, after many years of continuously 
growing 
power consumption, one began to realize that the capacity for 
electricity production would not suffice in the long run. An 
extensive energy planning was begun, with the result, among 
others, that the company declined to participate in a consortium 
for two nuclear reactors. Energy conservation would instead 
replace new power. The target is for 177 MW to be saved by the 
year 2002, which is the equivalent of about eight percent of the 
maximum output. The DSM programs undertaken during the period 
from 1977 to 1988 involved both the housing sector and the 
industrial sector. 
  In the housing sector, nine programs have been implemented 
involving information, energy loans and discounts on 
energy-saving hot water heaters. The load has thereby decreased 
by an average of 12 MW (a drop of about 0.6 percent). The total 
cost amounted to 58 million dollars at today's prices. 
  The programs in the commercial property sector and in the 
industrial sector began later, about 1982-83. A total of 10 
programs have been carried out, mostly involving information. 
The output has dropped by an average of 10 MW (a reduction of 
about 0.5 percent). In all, the cost amounted to 11 million 
dollars at today's prices. 
<H5>  Bonneville Power Administration </H5>
  Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is a federal 
organization and belongs to the DoE. BPA is in charge of 
electric production and distribution in the states of 
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, parts of Montana and neighboring 
portions of California, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. Its capacity 
is 23,700 MW and it is largely hydroelectric. 
  In 1980 the BPA was given the task by Congress of using 
energy conservation as a resource. In the 1980's the BPS 
developed several savings programs, covering many sectors, such 
as: 


    -  more effective energy use in industry 
  -  energy-efficient buildings 
  -  demonstration and prototype facilities. 

    In 1989 the energy consumption had dropped nearly two 
percent 
through DSM programs. In the 1980's about 800 million dollars in 
today's prices were spent on energy savings. 
  The cost of a saved kWh was an average of 4 cents/kWh. 
<H5>  New England Electric System </H5>
  New England Electric System (NEES) is responsible for power 
production in certain parts of the New England region and is the 
mother company of three power distribution companies 
(Massachusetts, Narragansett and Granite State Electric). Its 
capacity is about 5,000 MW. 
  In 1987 NEES started DSM programs which were aimed at 
reducing the load by 230 MW by 1992, at a cost of 87 million 
dollars. In 1990 the savings at high load were about 200 MW, a 
cut of about four percent. At NEES as well, it was because the 
capacity began to approach the maximum limit at peak load that 
the DSM programs began to be implemented. In the New England 
area the increase in energy consumption has been strong 
throughout all of the 1980's. This was mainly because of the 
strong expansion of business and industry which has occurred in 
the area. 
  NEES has utilized "least cost planning" to a large extent, 
that is to say the amount that can be saved compared with the 
cost of generating new power. 
  The NEES's 20-year planning, up to the year 2008, includes 
new power production as well as savings according to the least 
cost planning method. The potential for saving is estimated at 
nearly 1,000 MW in 2008, which is the equivalent of about 12 
percent of the total power production. 
  Within the industrial sector, eight programs have been 
carried out, whose primary purpose is energy efficiency with 
better design and construction and more energy-efficient 
buildings, products and systems. Load control has also been 
utilized. 
  In the housing sector, one has primarily aimed for hot water 
heating and electrically heated housing. 
<H5>  Taunton Municipal Lighting Plant </H5>
  The Taunton Municipal Lighting Plant (TMLP) is the 
"municipal" power company in Taunton, Massachusetts. 
  The TMLP's DSM program, which has been under way for a few 
years, is aimed at marketing low-energy light bulbs to the 
household sector which utilize 76 percent less energy and have 
13 times longer life than conventional light bulbs. 
  The consumer rents the low-energy bulbs from TMPL and the 
rent is included in the electric bill. TMPL replaces burned-out 
light bulbs for free. 
  The rent for the low-energy light bulb is set so that an 
average consumer receives a lower monthly electric bill, 
including the rent for the light bulb, compared to the 
electricity cost for a conventional light bulb. 
<H5>  Central Maine Power Company </H5>
  The Central Maine Power Company (CMP) is responsible for 
electricity production and distribution in Maine. 
  The CMP's DSM program is called "Power Partners" and is 
aimed 
at bidding for electric energy. The bidding must save at least 
100,000 kWh/year or reduce the load by 100 kW. The payoff time 
for the bid projects must be at least one year, calculated 
according to a "least cost planning" model. The program has been 
in effect since 1988, and at the end of 1989 there were six 
ongoing "Power Partners," projects that were planned to save 
96,000 MWh/year, which is the equivalent of more than 1 percent 
of the CMP's annual energy sales. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  Since the number of DSM programs in effect in the United 
States in the 1970's and 1980's is very large, it is not always 
possible to find both successful and unsuccessful programs. Many 
of the DSM programs have also been undertaken for experimental 
purposes and are therefore not always relevant to evaluate, at 
least not in terms of profitability. 
  A common denominator for many of the programs undertaken 
during the 1980's, above all, is that the drop in energy use is 
about 1-2 percent and that the peak output can be reduced by 2-3 
percent. The power consumers have also to a large extent 
accepted DSM. The reason for this could be that DSM is marketed 
as a way to reduce costs for the customers, which it has also 
turned out to do in many cases. DSM has also been used as an 
argument in the environmental debate and this has further 
reinforced the acceptance by electricity consumers. The question 
to ask from a Swedish point of view is why there has been so 
relatively little saving, when the expenses for these savings 
have been so large. 
  It should be understood, however, that the U.S. power 
production system is highly limited in output and by trimming 
the output peaks there is no need to invest in new power. By 
applying the "least cost planning" concept the value of a saved 
kWh or a trimmed kW at high load can be relatively large. In 
this way the purpose of the DSM program has probably had an 
impact, at least for some power companies. The equivalent 
calculations could not simply be transferred to the Swedish 
power production system, where maximum output is very rarely 
reached. In Sweden the value of a saved kWh or a trimmed kW at 
high load is thus not worth very much. 
  In general, there is a great deal of wasted energy in the 
United States, and the cuts in energy use which were achieved 
were often relatively simple savings measures, above all in the 
housing sector. Many programs have also been purely information 
campaigns. The customers have also been won over by effective 
"marketing." For the 2000's, savings potentials (or goals) have 
been discussed which far surpass the levels achieved so far. It 
is likely that more radical changes will have to be made then 
than until now, if the stated potentials are to be achieved. 
  In conclusion should be noted that it is not obvious who has 
controlled the development of DSM. Is it the power companies 
themselves who pushed it forward? Is it the complex legislation 
in the country, for which ultimately the politicians are 
responsible, which completely forced DMS onto the power 
companies? What has been the role of the consumers? 
<H3>  8. The Adjustment of the Pulp and Paper Industry to AOX 
Regulations for Organochlorine Compounds </H3>
  Background 
  Ever since the early 1970's there has been awareness in the 
pulp and paper industry of the problem of emission of 
organochlorine compounds from chlorine bleaching at sulfate 
factories. Even the Concession Administration knew about these 
emissions. In the 1970s it was difficult to quantify the 
emission levels, however, partly because there was too little 
knowledge about the actual emissions, and partly because there 
were no good measuring methods. Organochlorine compounds were 
often called just "color." However, the forest industry was 
forced, primarily by the Concession Administration, to work with 
these issues. 
  Since 1957 the forest industry has worked with environmental 
issues within the Forest Industry Foundation for Water and Air 
Protection Research (SSVL), and extensive environmental research 
has been carried out since 1970. The work involved primarily 
specification questions for emissions, biological and ecological 
effects of emission and technology development toward techniques 
with less environmental impact. Questions involving waste water 
from bleaching plants were of central importance during the 
entire period. The forest industry's joint environmental 
research project for the period 1970-1990 involved 445 million 
kronor at today's prices. 
  Measuring Methods for Organochlorine Compounds 
  In the 1970's the emission levels for biochemical and 
chemical oxygen demand (BOD[.sup]7[/], Biological Oxygen 
Demand and COD, Chemical Oxygen Demand) were established. But 
BOD[.sup]7[/] and COD provide no information about which 
individual compounds are included. 
  In the 1980s the focus was on organochlorine compounds. In 
1986 the variable TOCl (Totally Organically Bound Chlorine [Cl]) 
was used for the first time in a permit decision. The TOCl 
method, which is Swedish-developed, does not provide information 
about which individual organochlorine compounds are involved, 
however. 
  In Germany a technique was developed in the 1960's which 
adsorbs chlorinated organic substances on active carbon. The 
method was called AOX (Adsorbable Organic Halogens). AOX 
gradually replaced TOCl in permit decisions in the late 1980s. 
Today, organochlorine compounds are measured, such as kilogram 
of organically bound halogen per ton of bleached pulp (AOX). 
TOCl and AOX have often been treated as equivalent magnitudes. 
However, the AOX method gives 20-30 percent higher values than 
the TOCl method, due to the content of volatile compounds, among 
others. 
  The Development in the Forest Industry With Regard to 
Emissions From Chlorine Bleaching Plants 
  In the 1970's the emission level for conventional chlorine 
gas bleaching could reach 10 kg AOX per ton of pulp. 
  In the early 1970's oxygen bleaching was introduced as an 
entirely new process step. This reduced the chlorine gas 
consumption of the process and also the emission levels of 
organochlorine compounds. Oxygen bleaching was developed as 
early as the 1960s, primarily at MoDo. The technology was 
developed entirely without any government subsidies or other 
means of control. In the 1960's, however, aspects such as energy 
consumption and emissions with impact on the environment played 
a relatively minor role, and there was no major market for this 
process. 
  The Nature Conservancy Board in the early 1970's imposed 
stricter requirements for purification of waste water, but did 
not expressly require the use of oxygen bleaching. One way to 
clean the waste water, although with certain shortcomings, was 
aerated ponds. Initially, the Nature Conservancy Board often 
required aerated ponds. The industry itself came up with the 
counter-proposal of oxygen bleaching. Oxygen bleaching is a part 
of the process and, in addition to reducing the emissions of 
organochlorine compounds, it also cuts operating costs and is 
preferable for this reason. Today, all sulfate factories in the 
country use oxygen bleaching, which is quite unique, from an 
international perspective. Figure 1 [not included] shows 
chlorine consumption from 1970 and on. 
  This has declined after the 1970's, although production of 
bleached pulp has continuously grown. The primary reason for 
this is the introduction of oxygen bleaching. Other process 
improvements and additional purification steps have also 
contributed to a reduction of the emission levels. 
  In the mid-1980's the emission level from a conventional 
chlorine bleaching plant (without oxygen bleaching) was 5-8 kg 
AOX per ton of pulp. With oxygen bleaching, it was reduced to 
3-4 kg AOX per ton of pulp. 
  A continuous reduction of emissions of organochlorine 
compounds, measured in AOX, has taken place over the entire 
period since 1970, see Figure 2 [not included]. 
  In 1987 the forest industry believed that another reduction 
to a level on the order of 2.5 kg AOX per ton of pulp would be 
technically possible in the early 1990's. 
  The government went even further in the 1988 environmental 
bill, however. Here the targets for emissions from bleaching 
plants are stated. The forest industry is to have begun measures 
to reduce the emission levels to 1.5 kg AOX per ton of pulp no 
later than 1992. The goal is then to achieve 0.5 kg of AOX per 
ton of pulp in the early 2000's. 
  The Swedish forest industry agreed with the government and 
authorities that in the long term the emissions must be further 
reduced. What they did not agree on was the rate of reduction 
and the opportunities for influencing the competitor nations. 
The problems of reducing emissions of organochlorine compounds 
are considerable from the aspect of both investments and 
technology. 
  The development has gone faster than what the forest 
industry 
believed in 1987, however. In principle, the technology is ready 
but untested on a large scale. Against that background the 
forest industry did not dare promise to reduce the emission 
levels so drastically over such a short period. 
  In the mid-1980's the environmental debate in society 
intensified. The environmental debate about the forest industry 
in Sweden largely came to involve organochlorine compounds. The 
reason for this was, among other things, the alarming reports 
from the United States about traces of chlorinated dioxins and 
furans from waste dumps. Similar traces were also found in 
connection with pulp factories. It was modern analytic 
technology which made the discovery of this possible. A debate 
about chlorine-bleached pulp products developed. It was possible 
to determine dioxin traces in diapers, for example. The 
so-called "diaper debate" was conducted primarily in the United 
States and Western Europe. When the dioxin debate reached 
Sweden, the forest industry's environmental problems were 
focused on organochlorine compounds. 
  In Sweden there were also traces of chlorinated dioxins 
found 
in some places, for example in crabs outside Varo mill in 
Kattegat. 
  The dioxin debate was one reason to formulate the target for 
sharp reductions of AOX compounds in the 1988 environmental 
bill. The intensified environmental debate also to a large 
extent influenced the content of the environmental bill. 
  In connection with expansion and new investments, 
investments 
have been made in modern environmental equipment and technology, 
or the permits would not have been approved. Due to the rapid 
rate of expansion in the industry throughout the 1980's, it has 
been possible to introduce new technology with less 
environmental impact. The total environment-related investments 
since 1968 amount to more than 12 billion kronor at today's 
prices, which is the equivalent of between 10 and 20 percent of 
total investments. 
  Until today, all the sulfate factories with bleaching 
facilities have been obligated by the Concession Administration 
to reduce their emissions to a level of about 1.5 kg AOX per ton 
of pulp; in some permits the emission levels were somewhat 
higher, in others somewhat lower. Most of the mills today are 
already below, or have proposed measures for reaching levels 
below, 1.5 kg AOX per ton of pulp. 
  Today the forest industry has succeeded, in a very favorable 
way, in reducing the emission level, even below the requirements 
imposed by the authorities. 
  Technological Development of Bleaching Processes 
  The forest industry in principle had two ways to choose in 
order to reduce the environmental impact of the bleaching 
process: keeping the chlorine gas bleaching but rendering the 
organochlorine compounds in the subsequent cleaning step 
harmless, or developing other bleaching and production processes 
in order to eliminate the residual lignin. Combinations of these 
two principles have also occurred. 
  The strategy has primarily been to alter the process itself. 
Some examples of this is the introduction of oxygen bleaching, 
greater use of chlorine dioxide instead of chlorine gas, 
extended delignification in the boiling and the use of 
oxygen/hydrogen peroxide in the alkali stage of the bleaching. 
All of these modifications reduce chlorine gas consumption and 
thus the amount as well as the composition of the emissions. It 
is primarily the chlorinated phenolic compounds with three or 
four chlorine atoms which have disappeared, as well as dioxins. 
Technological breakthroughs have occurred in several fields. 
  In general, the conversion of the bleaching technique has 
had 
a major impact on the energy consumption for producing bleaching 
chemicals. Oxygen, for example, requires less electrical energy, 
while chlorine dioxide requires considerably more electrical 
energy than chlorine gas. 
  Most of the above techniques were in principle ready in the 
late 1980's, but full-scale tests had not been done. The 
industry's joint environmental research intensified in the 
1980's. This work was coordinated and controlled by SSVL. A 
great deal of research and development work was undertaken by 
equipment suppliers and chemical producers in connection with 
the industry. From 1985 to 1990 the SSVL project Environment 90 
was under way. All the environmental programs within the SSVL 
have, since 1970, to a greater or lesser extent, involved bleach 
emissions. Studies of bleaching plant waste occupied a central 
role in Environment 90. 
  Another, not inconsiderable, part is the accumulated 
operational experience which has enabled the processes to 
improve further with respect to emission levels. When the new 
technology has been consolidated, emissions are likely to be yet 
further reduced. 
  Today, AOX levels below 1.5 kg per ton of pulp are not 
considered relevant from an environmental aspect, but must be 
regarded as technology parameters. The remaining chlorine 
compounds contain few chlorine atoms, are broken down relatively 
rapidly and are not regarded as equally dangerous from an 
environmental point of view. Other measurement methods must be 
developed in the 1990's. 
  Summarizing Analysis 
  Strict measures for reducing emissions of organochlorine 
compounds were started as early as the 1970's with the 
introduction of oxygen bleaching on a large scale. The main 
reason for this was the environmental requirements by the 
authorities. A major reduction in organochlorine compounds came 
with the introduction of oxygen bleaching, a decrease of about 
50 percent in comparison with conventional chlorine bleaching. 
  It is interesting to note that out of several different 
possibilities to reduce emissions, the Swedish industry itself 
chose oxygen bleaching. In the case of oxygen bleaching, it was 
also possible to refer to economic reasons. 
  Environmental issues grew in importance in the 1980's. The 
government also established strict environmental goals and set 
up strict environmental requirements. 
  Consequently, the forest industry was forced to introduce 
relatively untested technology on a large scale. The technical 
solutions existed, in principle. In the 1980's the forest 
industry expanded and the mills have made new investments. The 
fact the industry experienced an economic boom has helped the 
forest industry meet the strict requirements imposed on it. When 
they were expanding and making new investments anyway, the 
environment-improving investments were even more justified. 
  The market advantages, which in many cases it has been 
possible to exploit by offering the market non-chlorine 
(ClM[.sup]2[/]) bleached pulp products, have in several cases 
been a motor for the technology and justified the investment in 
new technology. 
  Sweden is far ahead from an international perspective. 
Today, 
this could mean market advantages, both for the paper 
manufacturers and for machine and chemical suppliers and 
consultants. 
  The level of demands in the permit decisions were one reason 
for the introduction of new technology, which was known but 
untested on a large scale. But public influence did not force 
the technology as such. The technology existed. The strict 
environmental goals which were established, and the market's 
demands for alternative, bleached, "environmentally friendly" 
products, were the reasons behind the rapid introduction of the 
technology, however. Aspects which may have reinforced the 
investment in the new technology were that the industry was 
experiencing a boom in which strong expansion was taking place, 
and that was a better justification for environmental 
investments. The conversion has cost a great deal of money, 
however, which it has been difficult to get back in the form of 
higher product prices.

  1. Just as interesting as studying successful commercial 
projects is to study failed commercial projects. Here concepts 
such as stop factors (or failure factors) are used. There are 
few documented failed projects, however, primarily because 
technology developers or their companies do not want to 
advertise failed projects officially. A study which makes paired 
comparisons between successful and unsuccessful projects is the 
SAPPHO study (Freeman, 1982). 
  2. The direct development cooperation between a technology 
developer and a government buyer in the form of a state-owned 
corporation or such has been very successful historically. As 
examples of such cooperations outside the energy field may be 
mentioned ABB-SJ (trains), Ericsson-Telecommunications Agency 
(telephones), Saab-FMV (aircraft) and Bofors--FMV (weapons). 
  3. This did not mean that they acted as "technical patrons" 
for the industry, which has sometimes been inaccurately 
indicated. The development has been to the advantage of both 
parties. 
  4. Something which, however, was mostly a result of the 
vague 
manner of Swedish energy statistics in comparing electrical and 
thermal energy. 
  5. This trend is thus not limited to energy technology. 
  6. By innovation support in this text we mean all types of 
measures to support the development and use of certain new 
technology. This can also take place for example through 
information campaigns, etc. Support should thus not be 
interpreted as just financial subsidies. 
  7. In Supplement 2 three cases of such public influence are 
described: the German power industry's adjustment to 
SO[.sup]x[/]/NO[.sub]x[/] rules, Swedish nuclear waste 
technology and the adjustment of the pulp and paper industry to 
regulations for emission of organochlorine compounds. 
  8. In our collection of examples there are three cases of 
the 
latter type of means of control: the Swedish development in the 
bioenergy field and the heat pump field, and activities for 
efficient use of electric power in the United States. 
  9. Experiences are given in the collection of examples of 
the 
effort with energy advisers which was undertaken in the early 
1980's. 
  10. This should not be interpreted as criticism of the way 
these activities were conducted by responsible officials. On the 
contrary; these activities were carried out in a professional 
manner. 
  11. In 1979 Defibrator was absorbed into Sunds and Sunds 
changed the name to Sunds Defibrator. 
  12. It should be mentioned that the groundwood process as 
well has developed gradually. By also putting this process under 
pressure, so-called pressure grinding, lignins are plasticized, 
from which a stronger pulp is obtained than in the original 
atmospheric process. The process, developed by Tampella, gives a 
pulp which is used for higher qualities, such as journal paper. 
  13. Stal Laval was a wholly owned subsidiary of ASEA. In 
1984 
it changed its name to ASEA STAL. The development of PFBC was 
done at Stal Laval up to 1983 and after that at the ASEA PFBC 
company, which changed its name to ABB Carbon in 1988. PFBC is 
today carried out at ABB Carbon, which now is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of ABB. 
  14. In 1985 Ericsson's activity was reorganized and Ericsson 
Cables was formed, of which Sieverts Kabelverk was a part. 
Sieverts Kabelverk had long been a wholly owned subsidiary of LM 
Ericsson. 
  15. Each cable usually includes 12 fibers, but up to 36 
fibers can be found today. 
  16. By Germany in this case description is meant the Federal 
Republic, since the description generally deals with the period 
before unification with the GDR. 
  17. More than 80 percent of the nation's power supply is the 
so-called public electricity supply (Oeffentliche 
Elektrizitaetsversorgung). This group includes all enterprises 
which according to the Law on Promotion of the Power Industry 
(Gesetz zur Foerderung der Energiewirtschaft) are obligated to 
deliver power to a third party. Today there are about 1,000 such 
enterprises. The capital funding for the public power industry 
is mainly public (municipal, land or federal). 
  18. The emission limits are based on half-hourly levels, in 
which the limits may never exceed more than 100 percent. In 
Sweden the emission quantities are compared to the amount of 
added fuel. Further, the Swedish limits are average annual 
values. A fair comparison between Swedish and German measurement 
requirements can therefore not be made. Also, power plants with 
an added thermal output of 300 MW are given sealed equipment for 
continuous measurement of emissions. The measurement data are 
monitored and stored by independent monitoring organizations. 
  19. By biofuels are here meant forest fuels, including 
forest 
waste, and cultivated energy forest. Hay and reeds are also 
included, but the addition of these fuels is so limited that 
they are not discussed here. The forest industry's utilization 
of lyes, barks, sawdust, etc. in energy production will also not 
be discussed here, since this deals mainly with conversion from 
oil undertaken without any major government measures. It should 
be noted that the area "bioenergy" also included peat at the 
beginning of the period. When the field of "peat" received its 
own funding in the energy programs, the concept of "biofuels" 
began to apply more to forest fuels. The peat support has been 
about 400 million kronor during the period from 1975 to 1990, a 
large part of which was intended for investment support for 
facilities. Today, however, biofuels and forest fuels are 
equated. 
  20. Of these funds 40 million kronor were for 
production-related projects and 35 million kronor for combustion 
technology, both for forest fuels and peat. 
  21. Heat pumps are not intrinsically new. The first 
medium-sized heat pump was installed as early as 1858 in 
Salzkammergut in Austria in order to reduce the costs of the 
heat needed for salt production. The concept is in principle the 
same as is still used. 
  22. In addition to these funds, a certain amount of 
additional support was given to installation of heat pumps in 
multifamily dwellings, the so-called ROT program. 
  23. The volume of these indirect subsidies is difficult to 
estimate. 
  24. After 1989 a considerable number (10,000 units in 1990) 
of cheap, so-called comfort heat pumps, were sold to homes with 
direct-working electric radiators. Since it provides a very 
small energy saving, but is primarily being bought for reasons 
of comfort, it is doubtful to compare it with the other types of 
heat pumps. The relevance of the figure for 1990 may therefore 
be questioned. 
  25. The development has instead approximately followed the 
development of the price relationship between oil and 
electricity. 
  26. ASEA entered the market by way of an accentuated need 
for 
diversification at the end of the 1970's. The market for 
turbines was eliminated with the collapse of the shipyard 
industry and the limitation of the nuclear power program to 12 
reactors. 
  27. The interest should be viewed in connection with the 
fact 
that the Oil Replacement Delegation, OED, for example, at this 
time estimated the potential for heat pumps to be 55 TWh/year. 
  28. The effect of this type of effort is very difficult to 
evaluate, of course. In the majority of cases it is impossible 
to determine to what extent a certain type of information 
influences the attitude.

  [Text] The Small and Medium Enterprise Agency of the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is designing 
a new vision for the 21st century for technology policies for 
small- and medium-sized businesses. The Technology Policy 
Committee to be established as a part of the Small and Medium 
Sized Enterprise Modernization Council (an advisory organ of the 
Minister of MITI) will begin deliberations this fall. While 
developing a successor law to the Law on Extraordinary Measures 
for the Technology Development Promotion for Small and Medium 
Enterprises, which will expire at the deadline of July 1995, the 
Council will carry out support for restructuring and find uses 
of regional public research institutes (kohsetsushi labs) by 
regional industries. 
  Almost 10 years have passed since the Small and Medium 
Enterprise Agency endeavored to devise a new vision for 
technology policy based on a report completed in February 1985 
by committee of the Small and Medium Sized Enterprise 
Modernization Council. This committee recognized the need for 
new objectives given the changing economic and technological 
environments. 
  The Law on Extraordinary Measures for the Technology 
Development Promotion for Small and Medium Enterprises which 
currently forms the basis for technology policies for small- and 
medium-sized enterprises is based on the 1985 report. Support 
policies like loans for advanced capital, tax reduction 
measures, and exceptions for extra credit for companies 
implementing development plans authorized by the prefecture are 
organized under this law. Since this law has a 10-year limit, 
this system will discontinue as of July 1995. 
  The purpose of the new vision is to design a successor law. 
The report of the Basic Policy Study Group of the Small and 
Medium Enterprises Policy Council sought clarification of the 
vision for technology policy for the country. To address this, a 
study will begin. The Technology Policy Committee to be 
established this fall in the Small and Medium Enterprise 
Modernization Council will try to respond before the end of 
fiscal year 1993. 
  In concert with the new vision, about 170 kohsetsushi in 
prefectures throughout the country will begin to develop a 
system to facilitate the activities of small- and medium-sized 
enterprises like local manufacturing industries. Support for 
restructuring will also be included.

<H5>  Move To Field Specialization with the Closing of 100 Labs </H5>
  Fujitsu Ltd. (Tadashi Sekigawa, president) will completely 
revamp its 30 year old research and development system. In 
addition to reassessing the structure and function of Fujitsu 
Laboratories (Mikio Ootsuki, president; Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki; 
(044) 777-1111) and eliminating the two pillars of Kawasaki 
Laboratory (Kawasaki) and Atsugi Laboratory (Atsugi) five 
research laboratories will be re-established for specific fields 
such as multimedia and personal systems. Furthermore, about 100 
laboratories will be eliminated and a group system will be 
adopted where each group is built around a theme. This system 
will take effect on the 29th. For the last two years, Fujitsu 
has focused on the research and development system in 
affiliation with the Business Division at headquarters. 
Shortening the time between research and development and 
commercialization, and improving the effectiveness of 
investments are planned in this large-scale restructuring. 
<H5>  Shortening the Time to Market </H5>
  The purpose of the new system at Fujitsu Laboratories is to 
move from the former region-based research system to a 
function-based research and development system which is closely 
affiliated with commercial activities. The time-to-market system 
for decreasing the time from development to product 
commercialization, which has already been introduced, will be 
strengthened. The objective is a technical development system 
with a high level of competitive strength. 
  The new organization is centered around five laboratories 
for 
multimedia systems, personal systems, electronic devices, basic 
technology, and information society sciences. In addition, four 
new project divisions will be established under the direct 
control of the president. 
  Each laboratory will promote research on technologies 
related 
to next generation information systems related to the 
commercialization of personal information devices, software, 
ultra large-scale integration (ULSI), and electronic devices. A 
research field individualized to each region will expand in an 
interdisciplinary and a commercial manner. 
  With the themes of processors, optical technology, mobile 
communication devices, and next generation mainframes, the 
project division plans to shorten the time to commercialization 
by interacting with the Business Division at headquarters. 
  A total of about 100 laboratories suitable as the 
departments 
of the Business Division will be eliminated and changed into a 
fluid organization that gathers a staff in a research department 
for each theme. Although the total number of 1,700 employees 
will not change, about 10%, 110 people, will be 
transferred to 
the Business Division. 
  Previously, Fujitsu strove for research and development with 
autonomy that was not bound to the vertical organizational 
structure of the Business Division, thus, established Fujitsu 
Laboratories as a separate corporation in 1962. 
  With the acceleration of technological innovations in 
high-tech areas and the fierce competition in development, over 
the past two years since Vice President Ootsuki was promoted to 
president of Fujitsu Laboratories, the creation of an 
environment able to reflect rapid commercialization of research 
results has been studied.

<H3>  Eliminate Duplicate Research Through Rationalization and 
Specialization by Field </H3>
  To strengthen basic, creative research, the Agency of 
Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) has begun to restructure 
Government Industrial Research Institutes located in regional 
areas. The plan is to change from the conventional multifaceted 
research and development program to specialization by field 
founded on regional characteristics. AIST initiated a 
large-scale restructuring in January of this year by 
reorganizing its Tsukuba laboratories. This undertaking will 
spread to other regions. The objectives are to eliminate 
duplicate research as much as possible throughout AIST, to 
rationalize research activities while advancing the priority 
allocation of research appropriations, and to further strengthen 
basic, creative research. 
  According to AIST, the plan is to establish future research 
pillars for specialized fields by having Hokkaido GIRI use the 
research resources at its Microgravity Laboratory and perform 
research on cold region biotechnology; Tohoku GIRI, research 
metals; Nagoya GIRI, fine ceramics; Osaka GIRI, functional 
materials; Chugoku GIRI, ocean environment research; Shikoku 
GIRI, marine resources; and Kyushu GIRI, natural resources. 
  Each region has unique characteristics and an established 
research base. For example, in Kamisunagawa, Hokkaido, the 
invention of materials for use in a microgravity environment is 
being tackled based at the only microgravity research facility 
in Japan. Also, in the Chugoku region, the closed marine region 
of Japan's Inland Sea is used for research on marine 
environments. In Kyushu, natural resources like coal and clay 
are used to advance research on environmentally friendly 
materials. 
  AIST will revise its administrative rules and change the 
name 
``Government Industrial Research Institute'' to ``Government 
Industrial Research Laboratory,'' effective October 1 of this 
year. It was decided that the change to an appropriate name was 
important given the true state of research. With the shift 
towards basic, creative research, in addition to advancing 
multifaceted research, for instance, in biotechnology, new 
materials, and mechatronics, specialization in specific fields 
was planned for each research laboratory. 
  This restructuring will not take place over a short period 
of 
time, but will proceed over the next five to 10 years at AIST. 
The policy is to further the appointment, placement, and 
transfer of researchers, and the provision of facilities.

  [Excerpt] 
<H5>  June -- Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) </H5>
  The Industrial Science and Technological Development Section 
of the Industrial Technology Council (chaired by Hiroyuki 
Yoshigawa, president of the University of Tokyo) held its first 
meeting on June 10, 1993, in the annex to the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI). The main details are 
described below. 
<H3>  The Structure of the Industrial Technology Council's 
Industrial Science and Technology Development Section's Meeting </H3>
  The establishment of a section for each project in the 
meeting was agreed to. Since a comprehensive evaluation of the 
advanced material processing program, and mid-term evaluations 
of advanced chemical processing technology and manufacturing 
methods for high performance chemicals (for marine life 
activity) are to be performed, an evaluation committee was 
established for this purpose. 
<H5>  The Industrial Science and Technology Frontier Program (ISTF) </H5>
  The purpose of the program was explained and the details of 
the research and development were reviewed. It was decided to 
extend the research and development period for basic research 
and development in the propulsion program for supersonic 
transport by two years. 
<H5>  Note: </H5>
  (1) The Industrial Technology Council was established as an 
organization affiliated with MITI on July 25, 1973, with the 
task of examining crucial issues related to science and 
technology for the mining and manufacturing industry in response 
to an inquiry from the Minister of MITI. The head of the Council 
is Hiroshi Inose, director of the Japan Information Center for 
Science and Technology (JICST). 
  (2) The Industrial Science and Technology Section, which is 
organized as one divisional section, will review the ISTF 
Program, which began in 1993. 
<H5>  The ISTF Program </H5>
<H5>  ISTF Office </H5>
<H5>  1. Background </H5>
  In order to contribute to the advance of fundamental and 
original research and development that will contribute to the 
future development of industry and society as well as provide 
measures to address the quickening pace of society and the aging 
society, the former National Research and Development Program 
(Large-Scale Project), the Research and Development of Basic 
Technologies for Future Industries Project, and the Medical and 
Welfare Equipment Technology Development Project were 
consolidated in 1993, and a new R&amp;D system, the ISTF Program, 
begun. 
<H5>  2. System Overview </H5>
  The consolidation and revision of the former National 
Research and Development Program, the Research and Development 
of Basic Technologies for Future Industries Project, and the 
Medical and Welfare Equipment Technology Development Project 
mainly covered each of the following areas: 

  -  Fundamental and Original Research and Development 

    This is fundamental and original research and development to 
contribute to new social and economic developments by 
constructing and fostering new technological systems, or 
implementing technical breakthroughs. 

  -  Research and Development in the Public Interest 

    This research and development is needed to address societal 
tasks such as providing the foundation needed to improve the 
lives of the citizens, to guarantee the stable supply of 
resources, and to promote science and technology. 
  Exploratory research which provides preliminary basic 
research and investigation in the preproject stage is carried 
out in order to systematically and efficiently advance projects.

  [Text] The Japan Technology Transfer Association (JTTAS) 
will establish a research forum for exchanges between industry 
and academia on super fine particles. Focusing on the unique 
characteristics possessed by particles on the order of several 
nanometers (10[.sup]-9[/] m), the possible uses of these 
particles in industry are being sought. After collecting 
contributions the participating industries, periodic research 
forums scheduled to begin in October will be sponsored. 
  The Commission on Nano Structure Material Function and 
Applied Research, established as an executive office by JTTAS, 
is chaired by Yuichiro Nishina, professor in the Research 
Institute for Iron, Steel, and Other Materials, Tohoku 
University, and draws its working members from researchers in 
industry, government, and industry, such as the University of 
Tokyo, Kyushu University, Tsukuba University, Tokyo City 
University, Keio University, the Agency of Industrial Science 
and Technology (AIST), and private industry. 
  Compared to typical fine particles, super fine particles 
with 
dimensions of several nanometers have a higher ratio of atoms 
and molecules that constitute the particle's surface. By 
slightly changing the number of atoms and molecules, the 
physical and chemical nature of the particles changes 
dramatically. As a result, this research field has attracted 
attention in recent years. So in addition to being adopted in 
the Ministry of Education's Basic Research Program, AIST also 
began a project which has the aim of establishing technology 
that manipulates individual atoms and molecules. Information on 
the goal of developing new materials using super fine particles 
will be exchanged between industry and academia at the research 
forum. 
  In advance of the forum, a public seminar (admission 
charged) 
will be held in Tokyo on July 7, and the participating 
industries are invited. JTTAS, a corporation authorized by AIST, 
manages, for example, exchanges between industry and academia 
and the services of talented people that accompany each kind of 
technical issue. 
  For information about the research forum, contact the 
executive office by telephone at (03)-3597-8200.

<H3>  International Agreement and New Standards for Software and 
Genetics Targeted </H3>
  On 21 June, the Patent Office announced the revised 
examination standard for patents which, for the first time, 
includes guidance on evaluating the novelty of an invention. The 
objective is to seek international agreement in the application 
of the patent system. New standards were also set forth 
concerning ideas on protecting computer software and genetic 
engineering. The importance of the ``embodiment'' in the 
interpretation of the claims (scope of the patent) which has 
been strongly criticized by the United States and European 
countries, will be revised; patents will be flexibly judged with 
claims given priority and broad rights will be recognized. This 
standard will apply to applications dating from 1988. 
  In the guidelines for guaranteeing the fairness and 
reliability of the examination, the patent examination procedure 
consists of industry-specific standards and a general standard 
common to all technical fields. 
  The first standard was developed 30 years ago. The 
initiation 
in recent years of trilateral meetings involving Japan, the 
United States, and Europe had the objective of agreeing on a 
system, its operation and revision, and accumulating precedents 
involving patents. This time, this situation is taken into 
consideration and a full-scale revision was made. 
  The novelty of an invention is decided based on the standard 
of whether a skilled person having ordinary knowledge of a 
technical field would easily think of the invention. While in 
the new standard, the examiner does not reject novelty when the 
idea of ``easily comes to mind'' based on documents in similar 
technical fields cannot be demonstrated. 
  As for computer software, the conditions of using natural 
laws in information processing based on software and the 
inseparable link with the hardware were clarified. 
  Accordingly, program trading of stocks and game software 
that 
simply substitute the brain activity of humans in a computer are 
not the objects of patents. In addition, an invention of the 
recording medium that stores a program is not applicable to 
patents. 
  In contrast, in genetic engineering, the standard prepared 
concerning the novelty of inventions related to DNA 
(deoxyribonucleic acid) that contains specific base sequence 
that form protein are: 
  (1) When the protein is original and advanced, it is novel. 
  (2) When a protein is known, but the sequence of amino acids 
is not common knowledge, the sequence of amino acids that forms 
the protein is not novel if a skilled worker, a person 
possessing ordinary knowledge of the same technical field, can 
easily determine the sequence. 
  (3) When the amino acid sequence is common knowledge, if the 
effect is exceptional for DNA that forms a protein compared to 
DNA that has another base sequence, the novelty is recognized. 
  Concerning the interpretation of claims, since it is nearly 
impossible for the applicant to prove the realization of the 
invention in the section for the detailed explanation of the 
invention in the specifications by describing every important 
embodiment, the judgment is not based only on the embodiments, 
the invention is understood centered on the claims. As a result, 
even if the embodiment is not described in the section for the 
detailed explanation of the invention, the completion of the 
invention by the applicant is recognized from the description of 
the claims, and rights are granted. 
  In addition to announcing the revised examination standard 
in 
a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) report, it 
has been published by the Invention Society.

  [Text] To strengthen the research program in basic and 
creative areas, the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology 
(AIST) of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) will establish an evaluation committee that brings 
together Nobel laureates in research at the Industrial 
Technology Fusion Regional Laboratory in September. The goal is 
for a prestigious third party to evaluate the results and 
progress of joint research at that research laboratory where 
researchers from Japan and overseas, and from industry, the 
government, and academia have gathered and tackled problems. In 
addition, the employment of Russian researchers as public 
research employees will also be studied. 
  The evaluation committee will consist of people with 
well-known achievements both as researchers and as research 
managers. The members are currently being selected. Beginning 
with Japanese scientists who have won the Nobel Prize, 14 
candidates are being appointed. Two or three heads of research 
institutes in the United States and Germany are expected to 
participate. 
  The content and management system of ongoing research at the 
same research laboratory will be discussed every one or two 
years. The evaluations of the evaluation committee will be 
received as outside opinions; however, the independence of the 
laboratory will be respected concerning the progress of research. 
  AIST will reorganize its national laboratories at Tsukuba. 
As 
one link, the laboratory was set up in January to undertake 
basic research that intersects fields like materials and 
information. 
  To promote joint research with, for instance, foreign or 
private corporations, in 1993, 14 foreign researchers have 
already been employed as public researchers in 15 national 
research laboratories throughout Japan. Currently, one 
researcher from Russia has been accepted at the Hokkaido 
Government Industrial Research Institute (GIRI). The employment 
of a second person in fusion research is being studied.

  [Text] ``If the technological developments of the 
industrial world and fundamental research from academia were in 
close league, there would be nothing in the world to fear.'' 
  This opened the first Technology Industry-Academia 
Cooperation Conference with leaders from academia and industry 
held at a Tokyo hotel on May 31. With these words, Yotaro Iida, 
chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, who chaired the 
industry side, emphasized the great expectations on forming new 
cooperative relationships between industry and academia. This 
conference was organized as a forum to discuss ways for industry 
and academia to cooperate. The participants were 15 of the best 
people from representative technical industries and 12 
engineering department heads from seven national universities in 
Japan. Although the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) proposed and mediated the conference, both sides 
demonstrated a strong interest. According to the Agency of 
Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of MITI, in less than 
one month after approaching the participants, the conference 
became a reality. 
  Previous industry-academia cooperation was limited to the 
range of individual research themes. In addition to having 
problems in training, there was little opportunity to have a 
dialogue on the structural and basic issues that stretched 
between both sides. Therefore, Hiroyuki Yoshigawa, president of 
the University of Tokyo and chair of the academic side, stressed 
the meaning of this conference by stating, ``I was convinced 
that the industrial world had no intention of changing its view 
of universities. However, the economic environment is undergoing 
major changes. Therefore, the time has come for industrial and 
academic organizations to think about a new cooperation 
mechanism.'' 
  The motto shared by industry and academia is ``the nurturing 
of creative people.'' The engineer's experience of a 
high-powered growth period is a necessary condition for 
developing high quality products and mastering mass production 
technology. But, President Yoshigawa reasoned, ``From now on, 
the people who will revive the new industry are important. That 
is, the engineer of the industrial revolution is being sought.'' 
<H5>  Related Legislation Prepared </H5>
  The report on the roundtable discussion sponsored by AIST, 
which was held three days before this conference, concluded that 
international joint research is an effective means for avoiding 
trade friction and contributing internationally. Based on the 
problem Japan faces with the criticisms of getting a free ride 
in basic research and the excess import of technology, the 
necessity for international cooperation in industrial research 
is indicated. 
  For this reason, a government policy was also proposed that 
begins by enlarging the budget for expanding national research 
organizations and institutes at universities, and promoting 
personnel exchanges. This policy crosses many areas, including 
the provision of related legislation to improve the procedure 
for the public and private use of patents. According to AIST, 
these proposals will be ``implemented in the government policies 
created next year.'' 
<H5>  The Antimonopoly Act Eyed </H5>
  On April 20, the Fair Trade Commission announced guidelines 
on antimonopoly laws related to joint research and development. 
An environment that promotes joint R&amp;D was provided from the 
perspective of the application of the Antimonopoly Act. The 
contents included, for example: 
  (1) No problem exists when the market share of a 
participating enterprise is less than 20%. 
  (2) When the market share exceeds 20%, a judgment is 
made by 
considering the research objective as a whole. 
  Hidekatsu Hirabayashi, regulation manager at the Fair Trade 
Commission, explained the objective as the ``desire to further 
promote fair joint research for industry by clarifying the 
decision standards concerning the application of the 
Antimonopoly Act.'' This kind of guidance has already been 
provided in developed countries and planning for international 
coordination is necessary. 
  In response, MITI feels constrained because ``the Fair Trade 
Commission itself decides whether antimonopoly laws have been 
broken. But, it is better, perhaps, if technological development 
by industry is not shackled.'' There is concern in joint 
research as well since competitive restraints that emphasize 
preventative restrictions like merger regulations were 
introduced. 
  However, there either hasn't yet been a case that had this 
problem or the concern from important private industries is 
slight. 
  From the perspective of industry, academia, and the 
government, the opportunity to build an environment to promote 
joint research should lead to a broader debate on competition 
policies for joint research.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] As director of the Fukuoka Prefecture Industrial 
Technology Center for two years until last April, I would like 
to describe my experience in participating in the promotion of 
regional technology from the perspective of the prefecture. 
  As you well know, all the urban and rural prefectures and 
one 
tenth of the cities have a kohsetsushi (Technology Upgrading 
Center) located in it. The total number of researchers is about 
15,000. This number is 1.5 times the number at national research 
institutes, excluding universities, and is in no way a small 
number. Also, in contrast to the high concentration of the 
researchers of private, national, and special corporations in 
the Tokyo metropolitan district, naturally, these researchers 
are distributed throughout the regional areas. 
  In kohsetsushi, 4,200 to 4,300 people, a little less than 
30% of the total, are in the so-called industrial system 
that 
belongs to a commercial and industrial department. The number of 
researchers at the kohsetsushi in the Chugoku region is about 
320 people, 7 to 8% of the national total. Even when 
looked at 
in terms of the percentage of the total population and 
industrial shipping nationwide, this is an adequate number. 
  Industrial kohsetsushi centers were positioned as 
organizations to provide technical support primarily to small- 
and medium-sized enterprises in regional areas. When support of 
the advance of Japan's industrial modernization is considered 
historically, they have played a major role in the introduction 
of advanced technology primarily from Europe and the United 
States to regional small- and medium-sized enterprises and 
support industrial modernization in Japan. The kohsetsushi 
center which has developed throughout the country is a uniquely 
Japanese institution. In the past they were closely studied by 
developing countries, primarily in Asia, but recently, advanced 
countries in Europe and the United States have shown a 
heightened interest in them. Even the difficult to pronounce 
Japanese word ``kohsetsushi,'' which is how they are generally 
referred to in Japan, is used unchanged in English; it even 
appeared in the campaign promise of President Clinton for a 
policy of industrial support. This seems to be the result of the 
recent economic development in Japan being viewed with amazement 
by other countries and its source being carefully investigated. 
When something like this is heard, the view of foreign countries 
will truly continue to change. 
  Recently, the promotion of science and technology in 
regional 
areas throughout the country has been stressed. Technology in 
the prefectures is being advocated and the Government Industrial 
Research Institutes are continuing to be transformed into 
industrial technology centers in many prefectures. The 
kohsetsushi is also in a transition period. To summarize this 
trend, it is research directed and research centered. The work 
of the kohsetsushi is roughly classified into the three pillars 
of research and development, technological leadership, and 
requested testing; now, the shift is towards research and 
development. 
  This demonstrates that within the move in Japan towards more 
advanced industrial technology, the major switch is from the 
technical guidance support of the past by the kohsetsushi 
centers to support for research and development; that is, the 
objective is to nurture small- and medium-sized enterprises that 
have technical development strength. In order to do this, 
various reforms such as cultivating human resources that have a 
high research potential and improving the research content are 
moving forward. 
  Let me introduce some characteristic cases from Fukuoka 
prefecture where I used to work. 
  (1) Along with converting four research institutes that all 
had regional names into research laboratories that carry the 
names of technical fields in 1990, a planning and control 
department was established to conduct overall planning and 
coordination. In addition, an industrial technology center that 
integrates the organization was started. As an organization with 
a degree of independence and self-reliance from the main office, 
the center's head was ranked at the assistant director level in 
the administration. 
  (2) For the past several years, many people have been 
retiring so six new people were hired in 1991, and six to seven 
new people are being employed each year. On average, the 
retirees graduated from technical high schools, while the people 
entering were trained at national universities like Kyushu 
Technical University, and two have received doctorates. Most of 
the applicants are skilled and about half have business 
experience. Academic credentials are improving rapidly. 
  (3) As for the research content, support for the 
commercialization of products is hidden in the shadows. 
Fundamental and advanced themes related to food allergies, 
synthetic bimolecular films, clathrate compounds, and new glass 
are becoming prevalent. These themes are being actively pushed 
forward by young researchers primarily in regional universities 
and national institutes in cooperation with very enthusiastic 
small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
  The shift to research in Fukuoka prefecture is occurring 
smoothly overall, but administratively, priority hardware like 
buildings and equipment, and software like academic trip 
expenses and libraries for the research environment are 
remarkably scant. Moreover, a major problem is inexperienced 
research management that includes a lack of research leaders in 
the labs. Although many problems abound, at least compared to 
five years ago, the people and the substance has changed. For 
the two years I was there, dynamic changes were realized. 
  These kinds of changes at the kohsetsushi centers have a 
difference in degree but are occurring throughout the country. 
The form in 10 years will probably have a completely different 
image than it has today. This is one part of the restructuring 
throughout Japanese society in the continuing move from a 
developing country to an advanced country that leads. We would 
like the national institutes in regional areas to look carefully 
at the changing kohsetsushi and develop close ties in order to 
contribute to the industrial activities of the regions and carry 
out creative research exchanges.

  [Text] The Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. 
(SJAC, Chairman Isamu Kawai) has proposed to the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) that it start basic 
research on supersonic passenger aircraft in January 1994. Their 
ultimate goal is to develop the technology required to produce 
lighter airframes for non-stop flights between Tokyo and the 
east coast of the United States. According to the mid-term 
report submitted at the end of 1993 by the Next Generation 
Aircraft Investigation Committee of SJAC, the future demand for 
supersonic aircraft between the years 2005 and 2015 is estimated 
to reach a maximum of 1,000 aircraft worldwide. The project, 
which can realize the dream of connecting Tokyo and New York in 
about 4 hours, is about to draw considerable public attention. 
  Noise is a major problem during supersonic flight. Shock 
waves, or sonic booms, could reach the ground in an intensity 
adequate to break windows. In order to minimize this problem, 
SJAC plans to establish a route between Tokyo and the U.S. east 
coast that detours out over the Atlantic Ocean rather than 
flying the shorter Great Circle route over Canada. Planes 
traveling this route will require a cruising range of more than 
12,000 kilometers. U.S. Boeing, UK British Airways, and French 
Aerospeciale are all carrying out projects on supersonic 
aircraft with cruising ranges of about 10,000 kilometers, 
considerably shorter than that planned by SJAC. 
  Lighter airframes are essential for longer cruising 
distances. SJAC plans to propose government/industry joint 
research on the development of heat-resistant composite 
materials. 
  The Engineering Research Association for Super/Hyper-Sonic 
Transport Propulsion System, a consortium of 
Japan/U.S./UK/French manufacturers, has already produced a 
prototype engine for supersonic aircraft. Successful operational 
tests were made in November 1993. 
  Success in airframe development, in addition to this 
successful engine test, is likely to propel supersonic aircraft 
development into a mega project for the 21st century.

  [Text] The government will introduce a permit system 
beginning 16 July for the export of biotech-related equipment 
and pathogenic organisms, which can be converted to the 
manufacture of biological weapons. 
  The goal is to prevent the proliferation of weapons to 
volatile regions of the world. Under this system, seven types of 
equipment such as freeze dryers and ultracentrifuges, and 63 
types of pathogens and toxins such as the Japan encephalitis 
virus will be restricted. The system will require exporters to 
report to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry the 
destination, user, intended use, etc., and export will be denied 
if there is a chance that these items might be used to make 
biological weapons. The Diet will revise the Export Trade 
Control Ordinance on 15 June. 
  It was decided to place restrictions on biotech-related 
equipment and pathogenic organisms at the meeting of the 
Australia Group (currently comprised of 25 nations including 
Japan, the U.S. and Europe) held in December 1992 in Paris.

  [Text] A group led by professor Toyohisa Kokubu and 
assistant professor Tadashi Hamachi have succeeded in 
immobilizing the enzyme myoglobin without denaturation inside a 
layered film of polysiloxane, which is cast using synthetic 
bimolecular membranes as a molecular mold. It is expected that 
new functions will emerge through high-order gathering of enzyme 
proteins, and we can now expect research to move in the 
direction of greater efficiency and higher functions in 
immobilized enzymes, biochips, and the like thanks to the 
establishment of this method. 
  The group led by professor Kokubu has been conducting 
research to synthesize molecular ceramics. Researchers have 
combined enzyme immobilization with gel-sol techniques by making 
use of the fact that synthetic bimolecular membranes form 
precise gathering sites on the molecular level. This development 
originated in research that uses these gathering sites as 
molecular molds where the myoglobin is immobilized in a 
polysiloxane film. 
  More specifically, an amphipathic compound with a phosphate 
group (Fig. 1) is dispersed by ultrasonication in solution and a 
specified amount of an alkoxysilane compound (Fig. 2) dispersed 
in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid is added. After 
additional ultrasonication, an aqueous solution of myoglobin is 
added, and the mixture is cast to form a film containing 
immobilized protein. The researchers then immerse the film in 
chloroform to extract and remove the bimolecular membrane, and 
they have studied the resulting siloxane polymer containing 
immobilized myoglobin (Fig. 3) by X-ray diffraction, etc. 


  The researchers determined that protein plays a decisive 
role 
in memory formation because imprinting does not occur if protein 
synthesis inhibitors are injected. Then the Tsukada group 
focused on messenger RNA, which carries the blueprint for 
protein structure, and searched for mRNA that was present in 
particularly large amounts in the imprinted group. 
  As a result they found two mRNAs. When they analyzed the 
base 
sequences, the researchers discovered that these substances were 
a kainic acid binding protein that strongly binds to glutamic 
acid, which plays a role in nerve signal transmission in the 
brain, and a calcium binding protein (calmodulin) that is 
closely related to nerve cell metabolism. 
  Mr. Tsukada says, ``We cannot say definitively that the 
proteins we identified are the substance of memory, but at least 
we are certain that they are essential for the establishment of 
long-term memory.''

  [Text]A group including professor Go Endo and assistant 
professor Tomiki Ikeda, Resource Chemistry Laboratory, Tokyo 
Institute of Technology, and Akihiko Kanezawa, Japan Chemical 
Industry Association, have synthesized a new cation type 
antibacterial agent. The new antibacterial agent is a 
phosphonium salt polymer with long alkyl group side chains. 
Researchers have confirmed that it is more potent than the 
quaternary ammonium salt polymers that are currently in use, it 
kills bacteria rapidly, and it has high heat resistance. Because 
cation antibacterial agents are also effective against MRSA 
(methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus), the 
group will proceed with applied research for use of this polymer 
as an antibacterial material. 
  Cation antibacterial agents have received attention in 
recent 
years because of problems with infections spreading inside 
hospitals. Currently quaternary ammonium salt compounds are 
widely used because of their effective antibacterial action, 
etc. The structures of these compounds feature a dimethyl or 
trimethyl core with long alkyl group side chains, and it is 
believed that the long chain alkyl groups play an important role 
in antibacterial activity. 
  Professor Endo's group began research on the antibacterial 
action of phosphonium salt polymers with structures containing 
trialkyl phosphonium salts as their side chains. They based 
their study on their knowledge of phosphorus from research on 
epoxy hardening agents and on assistant professor Ikeda's 
research on antibacterial action. Their experiments confirmed 
antibacterial action of phosphonium salts. 
  They synthesized phosphonium salts (see diagram) by taking a 
long chain alkyl dimethylphosphine, which was formed by a new 
method, as a starting material and synthesizing a methyl 
chloride (1), by using chloromethylstyrene and ethylbenzyl 
chloride monomers to form a polymer (2), and by synthesizing a 
model compound (3). 


  In the CD software market for home use, a wide range of 
applications is seen not only in simple full motion playback but 
also in music software combining FMV and still pictures, 
education, and electronic publishing. In order to interface with 
this software group, the 704x480 pixel high resolution still 
picture playback specification, and playback control were added 
to the playback menu.

  Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the CD player. The 
complicated OS part is eliminated, and by adding a MPEG chip and 
RAM to the CD player, the hardware was organized so as to make 
it possible to create an inexpensive player including various 
models such as a radio-cassette player. 


  Since the purpose of Video CD is to explore the home market, 
it is important for it to be compatible with existing CD-I FMV. 
Continuity and compatibility with existing products is 
maintained by bridging the regulations and enabling playback on 
a CD-I FMV player. 
  Furthermore, the Video CD regulation is different from that 
of CD-I. Since the OS is not specified, a personal computer or 
game computer with an MPEG animation board can be used. 
  Video CD disks can be manufactured at existing CD factories. 
The manufacturing cost is less than that of tape, and large 
scale duplication is easy. Business functions have already been 
established and range from a rich resource of video software, 
disk manufacturing, and sales, to distribution. By preparing for 
an MPEG encoder necessary for the production of software, new 
disk media for video playback with music software will become 
feasible. 
<H5>  Establish Memory Area For Disk Information </H5>
  The CD organization for Video CD, is based on the form 1 
specification of CD-ROM XA. File management follows the ISO 9660 
format. 
  The disk memory area roughly consists of read-in block, data 
block (track 1-99), and read-out block. The video CD information 
block (INF VCD), which is new, was added at this time. In this 
block disk information is recorded. Full motion and still 
picture IDs recorded on the disk are stored in the list, which 
is the ID offset table (LOT) located in that block. The playback 
procedure is recorded with a list of descriptive forms in 
playback control (PBC). It became possible to write data in the 
segment play area for still pictures used for the screen menu. 



  CD-I application software is also established. When the disk 
regulated by the Video CD is played back by a CD-I FMV player, 
the player first reads this part, and playback is processed 
according to the procedure specified by the application. If 
directory management is necessary as in the case of a personal 
computer, the file is managed according to the file structure 
shown in figure 4. 



  Usual MPEG data is recorded in track 2 or a later track. A 
maximum of 99 tracks can be used. However, in the case of Video 
CD, it is possible to playback high resolution still pictures 
using only track 1, rather than using simple interactive 
software utilizing playback control. 
<H5>  FMV And Voice Recording Based On MPEG 1 </H5>
  Full motion Video CD and audio signal recording formats are 
based on MPEG 1; 1.2M bit/second for video and 0.2 M bit/second 
for audio were assigned. Screen dimensions are: 352x240 pixels 
in the case of NTSC (30 Hz), and film (24 Hz); and 352 x 288 
pixels for PAL (25 Hz). Image quality will be almost the same as 
the home VHS video. 



  If a player with NTSC specification is used to playback a 
Video CD disk with PAL specification, then about 20 lines are 
lost. If an NTSC disk is played back with a PAL player then a 
black band will appear on the top and bottom of the screen. 
Also, in the specification this time, the ratio of horizontal to 
vertical lines is 4 : 3, suitable for regular TV reception, and 
it is hard to say if it will be suitable for 16 : 9 wide screen 
TV. This problem will be a future topic to study. 
  The audio format of Video CD uses MPEG1 layer II. MPEG audio 
can interface with a wide range of high speed encoding from 32 k 
bit/second to 448 k bit/second. Considering simple software 
production and high quality sound, the speed is limited to 224k 
bit/second. Playback mode is stereo (2 channels). It is also 
suitable for Karaoke software enabling Channel 0 for music 
recording, and channel 1 for music and songs. 
  Figure 6 shows the organization of the Video CD tracks. The 
MPEG video MPEG and audio data are stored with interleave on the 
disk, and set with a ratio of 6 : 1 on average. Assuming a 
search by track number just like existing CD players, there is a 
front and rear margin of 15 sectors and a pause margin of 150 
sectors. This is done so to reduce the influence of the bit 
stream when searching. 



  As seen in figure 7, the MPEG video sector format consists 
of a pack header and pack data. One pack is 2324 bytes which is 
1 sector of a user data block in a CD-ROM. 



  The MPEG audio sector format is basically the same as that 
of video. However 12 bytes are a pack header, 13 bytes are a 
packet header, and 2279 bytes are allocated to data and with the 
left over 20 bytes (record 0) added make 2324 bytes as one pack. 
<H5>  Simple Interactive Software Realized </H5>
  Interactive playback of FMV and still pictures on the Video 
CD is realized by a function called playback control. Figure 8 
shows an example of playback using this feature. The example 
shows the possibility of simple branch playback by preparing 
several menus of still pictures in the segment play area of 
track 1 and combining the MPEG FMV and still pictures stored on 
or after track 2. 



  [Text] Playback control is also called play sequence 
descriptor, 
and branching playback procedures are listed descriptively. 
There are play lists and selection lists in playback control. 
The full motion playback procedure is described in the section 
list, and the menu playback procedure is described in the 
selection list. Access the desired full motion or still picture 
data by following the playback control function here, the 
address of the full motion and still picture stored in the list 
ID offset table (LOT) should be referenced. The size of the 
control data necessary to realize the playback control function 
is about 512K bytes maximum. 
<H5>  Toward ``General Video'' Era </H5>
  The best characteristic of the Video CD regulation this time 
is to be able to provide consumers with an inexpensive playback 
function as well as rich video software in form of CD by 
utilizing the existing huge CD industrial base. If a real time 
encoder is available, then production of video software using 
CD-R, which can add descriptions and can record once, will be 
possible. The era of ``General Video'' in which people enjoy 
digital video comfortably and easily will have arrived. 
  The CD Video is expected to be used in various fields once 
the market is penetrated successfully, which will be in 1994. 
The contribution of those people who helped to establish the 
Video CD regulations is appreciated.

<H5>  Special Issue: Security, LAN, Network OS, and Open Systems </H5>
  The trend toward open systems should be welcomed by 
users. However, these kinds of open networks can also expose 
important business information to danger. This is because LAN 
hosts and servers can be easily accessed from outside the 
company. 
  Security can be guaranteed for the most part by using 
the built-in functions of network operating systems and by using 
techniques at the operational level. Products which supplement 
the areas of weakness are coming onto the market. However, when 
security is strengthened, there is concern that the original 
flexibility of an open system may be lost. 
<H5>  Part 1: The Rapid Increase of Dangerous Networks </H5>
  ``Linking'' techniques, which center on LANs such as 
TCP/IP, NetWare, and LAN Manager, etc., are bringing about the 
construction of a truly user-friendly environment. However, the 
down side to increasing the degree of freedom is that this 
so-called openness is creating security problems. 
  A variety of programs and databases on personal 
computer LAN servers, UNIX machines and mainframes can be 
accessed through LANs. However, there is a growing danger that 
sensitive and confidential information may be leaked by 
unauthorized people accessing and viewing it. 
  Mr. Hajime Iwasawa, chief inspector of the Kyowa Hakko 
Industrial Company's Information Systems Department, says 
``There continue to be about 10 instances of access by unknown 
parties.'' At Kyowa, employees can access the internal company 
system from outside locations through a subscriber phone 
network. A VAX, which is linked to a LAN and dedicated-use 
lines, distributes and coordinates calls, and it can be accessed 
from personal computers via TELNET of TCP/IP, etc. The VAX is 
used as a communications server for connecting to public 
networks. When we were randomly viewing the VAX surveillance 
terminal, a log-in showing a connection log-in failure was 
displayed. 
  Mr. Iwasawa said, ``As a result, we do not know who that 
person was.'' It may have been an employee who actually failed 
to get on, but there is no guarantee of that. Because it was 
randomly viewed on the surveillance terminal, who it was could 
be discovered. Because they are not always checking the logging 
operations, there may be other times when access is gained by 
unknown parties. 
  There was a recent incident of a computer virus infection at 
the National Cancer Center. The virus invaded nearly 200 
machines including NEC PC-9800s, Apple Macintoshes and IBM PCs. 
The tip of the arrow began with the use of reference searches 
and electronic mail by a NetWare personal computer LAN. 
Fortunately, the virus was simply one that made a sound, and 
losses were minimal. 
  Later, the source was found out because it was from a 
personal computer infected by a virus that had recorded its ID, 
etc. A virus that invades because of a little carelessness and 
spreads throughout an entire company is not that rare. 
  Both of these examples involve a process that occurs in an 
``open'' information system, and this makes it necessary to 
reconsider security measures. ``In conventional host-terminal 
systems, who can enter is determined naturally. However, in open 
systems, it is easy to connect with the network. We must be able 
to determine who may not enter,'' says Mr. Iwasawa of Kyowa 
Hakko. The number of businesses connected to networks is growing. 
<H5>  Security Is Compromised by Creating an Open System </H5>
  With downsizing and the creation of opening systems, 
information is expected to be liberated from a closed world. An 
environment is growing in which it is easy to connect to 
everything from personal computers to mainframes. Personal 
personal computer LAN network operating systems (NOS) such as 
NetWare from Novell and LAN Manager from Microsoft are 
reinforcing this openness, and standard protocols represented by 
TCP/IP are being supported. Mainframes also permit TCP/IP 
connection, and this sets up an environment that can be 
connected from top to bottom. 
  The number of personal computer terminals which can link up 
to networks is growing, and information resources such as access 
programs and databases are expanding and diversifying. A 
personal computer linked to a LAN creates an environment in 
which it is possible to access information that can be 
physically located anywhere. 
  On the other hand, network infrastructures which have this 
kind of flexibility and exapandability carry with them the 
weakness of being vulnerable to external enemies. They are easy 
to use, but they are fragile in relation to unauthorized access 
and acquisition of information. Nearly the entire structure is 
open to the outside, and this creates an environment that falls 
easy prey to unauthorized activities. 
<H5>  Guaranteeing That a User Is Authorized Is Difficult </H5>
  For a long time, systems have tried to verify who the user 
is 
when the host system is accessed. In the log-in procedure, the 
host side verifies that it is the correct user by having the 
user input an ID name and password. The procedure for confirming 
the user by ID name and password is the same in the world of 
personal computers, LANs, and UNIX. 
  In almost all cases of confirming whether or not a user is 
authorized, the ID and password are all there is. In a typical 
LAN system, if an ID and password are used, the program and 
database can be accessed from virtually anywhere. This practice 
receives high marks from the point of view of convenience. 
  However, if the ID and password are leaked, that's all there 
is. There have even been extreme examples when the ID and 
password were written on a memo pasted on the personal computer. 
That kind of loose management permits unauthorized use, and easy 
intrusion into the system. It is also possible to make a program 
that tries to gain access by substituting the passwords. 
  With PC LAN servers, access control functions are provided 
which can stipulate the range of programs or databases that can 
be accessed from the terminal of each user. The place where the 
control range is determined, however, is the user ID. If the ID 
and password are stolen, the control loses all meaning. 
<H3>  By Opening a System, Mainframe Utilities Are One Just Step 
Away </H3>
  Once a mainframe is opened up, security checks become a 
whole 
level softer. Conventionally, independent addresses were set to 
each individual terminal, and the connection between the host 
and the terminal was made by built-in coaxial cable or by a 
dedicated-use line. Specifically, a one-to-one correspondence 
was established between the communication port of the host and 
the terminal. Even in public network relays, such as subscriber 
telephone networks, terminal addresses are incorporated into 
independent procedures. Thus, these could not be called the 
world of easy access by ID and password alone. For example, even 
if the ID and password are found out, access cannot be made 
through a different terminal. There are also instances when the 
menu itself is varied. 
  As the protocol moves from individual to open, the 
circumstances change. A gateway is offered by which mainframes 
and third parties can access the host by TCP/IP from PCs, etc. 
However, when TCP/IP is used, unless special techniques are 
employed, the host cannot discriminate between terminals. 
  The connectivity of the TCP/IP open protocol implies that a 
terminal address for individual manufacturers cannot be 
implanted. All that can be requested is an ID and a password, 
and seen from the conventional vantage point, security is lax. 
<H5>  Data Can Be Easily Stolen </H5>
  There is the possibility of stealing data. In a LAN system, 
all data run on cables between nodes that are linked by 
segments. ``Even if access rights are restricted by ID and 
password, this information can be viewed and stolen,'' says Kazu 
Sugiyama, team leader of the Technology Development Department, 
Systems Business Department, Catena. 
  For example, by taking the electrical signals out from the 
cable at the circuit board and converting them to data, the data 
can be viewed on the monitor. If a LAN management analyzer is 
used, it is even more simple. LAN analyzers are convenient 
systems when analyzing traffic conditions and breakdowns, but in 
fact, data can be seen. If an analyzer system is installed in a 
PC which is connected to the LAN, data can be stolen right from 
there. Some information, such as personnel information, should 
not even be seen by people within the company. With an analyzer, 
this also is not difficult to see. 
  Furthermore, if the ID and password that are necessary to 
verify the user are stolen, the consequences can be grave. There 
is therefore a function to scramble password data in the NOS of 
such systems as NetWare and LAN Manager so the password cannot 
be easily stolen. UNIX systems do not have this function, 
however. 
<H3>  It Is Easy To Have Unauthorized Access Without Leaving 
Evidence Behind </H3>
  An issue that must be raised in PC LAN and UNIX systems is 
that ``no evidence of operation and processing remain behind,'' 
indicates Jiju Tabuchi, manager of the Software Business 
Division, Information Systems Business Department, Fujitsu. 
  After an incident has occurred, a mainframe can follow who 
did what operation. This technique can be used to stop 
unauthorized access. The logging functions are weak, however, in 
a PC LAN or UNIX system in which a supervisor (super-user) can 
easily do anything. If no logging has been done, then no prior 
cause can be specified. 
<H5>  Unprotected Networks Are Hotbeds for Viruses </H5>
  According to the numbers of reported cases of virus damage 
tabulated by the IPA [Information Processing Association], the 
number of cases jumped from 57 in 1991 to 229 in 1992. ``These 
numbers probably represent just the tip of the iceberg'' 
believes Norio Yuto, director of the IPA Technology Center, 
Computer Virus Technology Survey Laboratory. 
  Businesses are appearing that will provide general security 
services against the kind of virus that Konica suffered. This is 
because it is expected that the number of damaging viruses will 
increase in the future. 
  As networks become more widespread, they will become hotbeds 
for computer viruses. Viruses are destructive programs that 
become incorporated into ordinary programs, and the entrance 
ways for viruses increase with the spread of networks. There is 
the fear that once they invade, they can be transmitted to the 
entire system before anyone realizes it. 
  If a virus enters a jointly used program on the server, then 
it is immediately extended to the entire network. If a virus 
contaminates a program that must be executed whenever any LAN 
user logs in, for example, the LOGIN.EXE on the server, it is 
very serious. Moreover, it may be possible for a virus to invade 
a program in the commonly used region of the database engine. 
  Because programs like LOGIN.EXE are write-protected so that 
only users having supervisor rights can access them, it is 
difficult for viruses to invade them. On the other hand, the 
supervisors themselves must be extremely careful in the daily 
use of the LAN. If the PC that the supervisor uses becomes 
contaminated, the entire system may become contaminated. 
  In addition, network-type viruses have recently come on the 
scene. There are viruses that spread throughout the server by 
breaking the access privileges of such systems as NetWare. The 
feeling of safety with the security measures for yesterday's 
problems can be eaten away in surprising new counterassaults. 
<H5>  Users Have Little Feeling of Danger </H5>
  The numerous dangers reported so far are heightening more 
and 
more in the LAN-WAN connection environment. There is a great 
need and desire to be able to access and use databases from 
outside companies. If their traffic becomes too great, both 
branch stores and business offices want to use public networks 
such as subscriber telephone networks because of communication 
costs. Businessmen also desire to be able to search client 
databases from outside locations using portable PCs. 
  The other side of WAN connection, however, is that security 
countermeasures become more difficult. If the network is closed 
with a dedicated-use line in the same building, access is 
limited to physically connected terminals inside the company. 
However, the moment a port is used to connect the system to a 
public network, there is the possibility of access by numerous 
undesignated parties. 
  In this regard, there are few users who lend a hand in 
improving security. Generally, they have only a dilute sense of 
danger. There are data to suggest that 23% of companies 
do not 
use even the most basic of security countermeasures, the 
password. In June of 1992, the Japan Information Processing 
Development Committee (JIPDEC) conducted a survey of 4,649 user 
companies regarding security, and this was one of the results 
obtained in the responses from 1,894 companies. 
  Even if the need for security is recognized, ``it is a pain 
when it comes to the budget'', and it is a headache for most 
information system managers. Security countermeasures do not 
produce a result that could be called ``increasing the 
efficiency of business.'' Rather, security increases management 
activities, and it cannot help but increase the number of 
employees in the information systems department. 
  As a result, the issue becomes one of how to convert the 
value of information into money. According to Kiyoshi Ono, 
manager of the Network Technology Section, Open Systems 
Technology Division, Nomura General Research Institute, it is 
probably natural that we hear, ``Spending &yen;1,000 to protect 
&yen;100 is not good business.'' However, the situation 
continues to be a matter not of &yen;100 but of &yen;10,000 
worth of information being dropped into the open system from the 
host. This information is being immediately exposed to danger. 
<H5>  Part II: Checkpoints for Security Countermeasures </H5>
  Security countermeasures can be brought about without 
any particular custom products. How aware users are of such 
things as company rules and operating procedures plays a big 
role. There are companies that actually put a great deal of 
effort into security. 
  However, security and convenience are inversely 
related. Even with vital information, if you think about 
security exclusively and make access too tricky, it loses 
meaning to speak of an 'open' system. 
  Generally, although users do not have much of a sense of 
danger, there are already quite a few businesses that have taken 
up measures to guarantee security. 
  Showa Shell Oil has made a PC LAN and host connection with 
NetWare and TCP/IP, but they have taken their own measures to 
``keep security tight,'' says Kazuhiko Arai, manager of the 
Information Systems Laboratory. 
  At Citibank, the password for the PC LAN supervisor is split 
in half and controlled by separate people. The supervisorial 
functions of the system cannot be touched unless both are 
parties present. As represented by this, Citibank has built a 
network with strict supervision and tight security. 
  The mainstream attitudes still seem to be ``connection comes 
first'', and ``the system that is closed within the company is 
safe,'' reflects Kiyoshi Ono, Manager of the Network Technology 
Section, Open Systems Technology Division, Nomura General 
Research Institute). However, it is the opinion of Hajime 
Iwasawa, chief inspector of the Kyowa Hakko Industrial Co. 
Information Systems Department, that ``security must be studied 
from the design stage of the network on up.'' 
  While revising its business system and network in January 
1993, Kyowa Hakko initiated an eight-member environment 
management group within the Information Systems Department. It 
is a group set up to study network supervision, management 
systems, and tools -- including security countermeasures -- from 
the design stage up. If the information carried on the LAN is 
important, then security countermeasures will be necessary. 
Rather than struggle with security at that point in time, it is 
better to consider the possibilities from the beginning and 
include the countermeasures in the system. 
  Whenever there are security issues, however, ``there will be 
users who won't know what to do,'' according to Jiju Tabuchi, 
manager of Fujitsu Information Systems Business Department, 
Software Business Division. In that situation, one should 
consider the ``Security Evaluation Standards'' that were studied 
by the Japan Electronic Information Development Association 
(JEIDA).

  This is meant to be a scale by which security functions can 
be objectively evaluated, and it was put together in August of 
1992 by JEIDA as a proposal for security functions and 
requirements. ``Functions and requirements'' means making 
adjustments to meet security needs. These functions and 
requirements are currently under review, and they are scheduled 
to be formally published in January 1994. Furthermore, the 
security requirements needed to evaluate and implement these 
functions are standardized in the following steps. 
<H5>  Point 1: Regulating the Permissible Access Range </H5>
  A PC LAN utilizing NetWare was introduced at Ajinomoto, and 
intracompany standards on the use of NetWare were drafted in 
January 1993. Included among these standards were adjustments in 
user access control. Determinations were made for permissible 
data access by allotting disk space and classifying directory 
systems and users. ``If the users and applications increase, 
they will just fit into the pattern,'' says Mamoru Umino, 
section manager of the Information Processing Business 
Department, Ajinomoto. Because the directories have been 
systematized in it, ``when anything happens, it can be checked'' 
(Mr. Umino). 
  Connection is made by the proper use of NetWare, LAN 
Manager, 
or TCP/IP. Then, access is controlled by determining which users 
are permitted access to which programs and databases on the 
server. If these access controls are correctly implemented, then 
unauthorized access will be prevented. 
<H5>  Use of NOS Access Controls </H5>
  Both NetWare and LAN Manager have network OS (NOS) functions 
that provide the capability of restricting directory and file 
access privileges (Table 2-2). Basically, these programs utilize 
user-level controls that set rights for each user or each user 
group regarding such processing functions as read/write and 
create/delete. In NetWare there are eight kinds of controls, and 
in LAN Manager there are seven kinds. Both programs can set 
detailed access privileges. In actuality, many users are set up 
to have only such basic access privileges as reading and writing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  In NetWare, it is possible to set attributes, that is, to 
set 
directory or file units to erase prohibit. Attributes are given 
priority over user-level access rights. For example, even a user 
who can erase files cannot erase a given file if that file has 
an erase protect attribute. When someone wishes to erase that 
file, a request must be made to the specified user who can 
modify the attribute. 
  On the other hand, in LAN Manager, a ``share-level security 
function'' is provided. A password is allotted for each 
directory and file. A log-in must be performed for each of those 
resources. 
  There are also many access controls at the application level 
above the NOS, but they cannot override the access privileges 
set by the NOS. 
  Access control ``is not a difficult thing, but the 
combination of functions can be complicated'' according to 
Hajime Sugiyama, team leader of the SI Development Department, 
SI Business Main Division, Catena. Therefore, if the kind of 
systematization that Ajinomoto has done is implemented, the 
system structure is made more efficient, and when there is 
trouble, maintenance operations can be promoted more expediently. 
<H5>  Router Filter Functions Are Also Effective </H5>
  Citibank uses a router packet filtering function, and this 
can control access. Ten BASE-Ts were introduced on each floor, 
and an FDDI of these branch line LANs is linked into a trunk 
line LAN by using a router. ``The determination of which places 
can or cannot be linked with which other places is set by a 
router access list, '' says Kentaro Tachiiri, assistant 
vice-president of the Systems Main Department. 
  What Citibank has introduced is a ``AGS'' system, and a 
multiprotocol router can generally filter data by using a 
variety of conditions. Routers can filter not only by IP 
address, but also by discriminating higher ranking protocols and 
applications. At Citibank, in addition to IP addresses, the 
router restricts passes between networks that can communicate by 
such protocols and applications as DECnet, NetWare, and 
Apple-Talk. Mr. Tachiiri says that a system was adopted so that 
``when it is necessary to modify or add passes, approval of the 
security manager must be obtained.'' 
  In addition to security functions, router filtering has 
significance in that data that do not have relation to that 
segment does not flow there, thus making it effective in 
reducing unnecessary traffic. However, ``when too may filtering 
conditions are set, the processing for routing causes delays'' 
according to Takehiko Higashi, business department manager of 
Network Systems. 
<H3>  Point 2: Increasing Checkpoints Corresponding to the 
Importance of the Information </H3>
<H5>  Strengthening Confirmation of the Authorized User </H5>
  At Showa Shell Oil, security has been strengthened, and 
strict conditions for identification of an authorized user have 
been set to the extent that ``vital information can only be 
accessed from the PC of that user,'' claims Kazuhiko Arai, 
manager of the Information Systems Lab, Showa Shell Oil. A 
management code has been installed on the PC FMR LAN board that 
is in the LAN terminals. When information of importance is 
accessed, in addition to the user ID and password, the 
management code is simultaneously checked. For this reason, even 
if another's ID and password are known, access from a different 
PC is not possible. 
  Even if restrictions are placed on resources that can be 
used 
by each user through the control of access, is the user making 
access truly the person indicated in the ID? How do we know 
whether this is not some other person making unauthorized use of 
the ID and password? At Showa Shell, depending on the 
information, if it is not the right PC, the conditions to deny 
access have increased, and the probability that it is an 
authorized user have been heightened. 
  In addition to this, Showa Shell is also using the technique 
of ``displaying the name of the user on the upper right part of 
the screen.'' This is also a method of discovering right away 
with a glance at the screen whether another user's ID and 
password is being used. 
<H3>  Strict Checks or Restricted Functions Placed on the Public 
Network That Make It Easy for External Enemies To Gain Entrance </H3>
  Currently Showa Shell is studying the possibility of 
connecting to a public network in order to allow access from the 
outside by support businessmen, etc. However, ``this is a threat 
to security'' (Kazuhiko Arai), and there are many users who are 
nervous about connecting with a public network. 
  For users connecting with public networks, there have 
already 
been restrictions placed on functions, and the check items for 
logging in have increased. 
  The Kumatani Group is restricting the use of subscriber 
telephone network routes so that ``the only possible use is for 
electronic mail'' (Akira Doi, Information Systems Lab, Third 
Division, Development Section). The mainframe and the PC LAN 
server are connected by an intracompany LAN, and this is mainly 
coordinated by TCP/IP; and there are also SUN workstations that 
are equipped to connect with subscriber telephone networks. 
There are IDs and passwords required specifically at the level 
of accessing these workstations. After that, the ID and password 
of the original user are input. Attention is paid to double 
passwords and restricting use to electronic mail. 
  This is also a technique for safely using a VAN. When 
communicating through a VAN, because the ID and password for 
entering the VAN must be checked, the ID/password check is 
doubled. Showa Hakko has evaluated this VAN security function, 
and has connected business locations that have low traffic by 
using a VAN. 
  In addition to VANs, Ajinomoto is using ``call back.'' In 
call back, access to the host is made from the terminal side, 
the ID and password are input, and the circuit is disconnected; 
afterwards, the circuit connection is made from the host side. 
The telephone number of the business location or home must 
already be recorded, and security is provided by denying access 
from any location other than the one recorded. 
  Ajinomoto uses an internal modem call back function, but 
custom equipment is also being marketed. For example, there is 
Defender, which is made by the American firm Digital PassWare 
and which is being handled by Chiyoda Information Machines. The 
ID, password, and password period of validity can be set and 
processed independently, and ``it places no burden on the host'' 
(Mr. Yoshihiko Kamimori, Sales Department Section 2, Eastern 
Japan Information Communications Business Department, Chiyoda 
Information Machines). 
<H5>  Verification of the User by Cards </H5>
  Defender offers one solution to the problem of restricted 
call back locations by using the SecureNet Key. This is a card 
with an input key that resembles a credit card-sized calculator, 
and the premise is that authorized users have this card. 
  How the card works and how it reports to the host side are 
shown in Figure 2-3 (not reproduced). When accessed, the host 
responds with a number that is called a challenge number. When 
the user inputs this to the card, the password is displayed. 
This password is input from the terminal. Because the challenge 
number is modified at each instance of access, the password 
changes every time. Every card is equipped with a special 
mathematical algorithm, and even if the same challenge number is 
input to a different card, a different value is returned. 
  Metro is scheduled to market the product ``SafeWord'' which 
uses the same technique on NetWare. It will be offered in the 
form of an NLM (NetWare-loadable module), which is a NetWare 
server application. Before the user logs on to the server, the 
SafeWord password is calculated by using the card. ``Because the 
password changes every time, it is safe even if monitored by an 
analyzer'' (Akio Araki, manager of the Business Technology 
Department, Information Security Systems Business Department, 
Metro). 
  SafeWord was developed by the American company Enigma Logic, 
and Metro is already marketing products for mainframes and 
minicomputers. 
<H5>  Point 3: Do Not Create Weak Spots </H5>
  It is particularly important not to create weak spots within 
open system security countermeasures. ``If a thief sneaks into 
one person's house, from there he will sneak into another's 
house'' says Hirofumi Katase, assistant section manager of the 
Data Processing Promotion Division, Machinery and Information 
Industries Bureau, MITI. 
  For example, even if techniques are created so that only 
specified users are permitted access to important data, when 
important data are downloaded into the client PC's hard disk, 
the effectiveness of countermeasures is reduced in half. Anybody 
can see the contents of PC's hard disk just by powering up. It 
data are downloaded to a floppy disk, it is also important to 
manage that floppy disk. 
  Moreover, computer viruses can spread injury throughout a 
company as a result of a little inattention from an individual. 
There are many companies that require that permission be 
obtained from their information systems department when users 
want to use software on their own. Use is confirmed by the 
information systems department after it has evaluated the 
software itself (this includes checking it for viruses). 
<H5>  Management Down to the Contents of the Individual PC </H5>
  They are very strict on this particular point at Showa Shell 
Oil. ``It is a company rule that neither downloading data onto a 
PC nor incorporating a program is permitted'' according to 
Kazuhiko Arai, manager of the Information Systems Lab. 
  At Showa Shell Oil, basically all company PCs have the same 
software installed by the Information Systems Lab, and a unified 
menu has been created. When it comes time for a new version of 
the software, they are all reinstalled. ``Even if the data 
stored in the PC are destroyed, there will be no complaints,'' 
says Mr. Arai. 
  When the end user wishes to use special applications, a 
request must be made to the Information Systems Lab. They are so 
thorough that when a special application has been approved, a 
seal is pasted on the PC saying that a special application is in 
use. 
  In any event, it is very important that security 
countermeasures are provided at the same level throughout the 
network. For example, even if access control is very tight for 
each user, ``it has no meaning if there is a ``guest'' ID that 
can enter without a password,'' says Shinichi Fukuda, manager of 
the PC First Technology Section 1, Personal Information Business 
Main Office, Technology Department, Sony. 
<H3>  Point 4. Consider the Balance Between Security and 
Flexibility </H3>
  When security countermeasures are promoted, freedom is lost. 
As with Citibank, when a router filtering function is run, 
freedom is restricted so that access from the PCs on another 
floor is not possible. As with Showa Shell, when a management 
code is embedded in the PCs, ``employees on assignment cannot 
access the host'' (Kazuhiko Arai). It cannot be denied that the 
ease of use has been diminished. 
  Meanwhile, the burden on the Information Systems Department 
has increased. It is necessary to create an access control list 
and manage IDs and passwords. Furthermore, if safety is a 
consideration, it is necessary to pay attention to periodically 
changing passwords. 
<H3>  Encrypting is Bothersome to Use in Terms of CPU Burden and 
Key Management </H3>
  Moreover, although encryption is an effective means of 
countering theft, it is not becoming very widespread because it 
increases costs and places a burden on the CPU as a result of 
the encryption processing. It also entails such problems as the 
need to manage the key which that goes along with encryption. 
  Generally, encryption involves the use of a secret key 
encryption method such as DES (Data Encryption Standard) or FEAL 
(fast data encipherment algorithm) developed by NTT. In these 
secret key encryption methods, it is necessary for both the 
transmitter and the receiver to maintain the same secret key 
data. 
  If there is a one-to-one relationship of communication 
partners, there is very little problem with this. However, when 
there is N-to-N communications as with LANs, it is very 
difficult to have common keys. It is possible to have a method 
in which there are key data in relation to all of the client PC 
partners, but it is dangerous to store secret key data on the 
hard disks of DOS machines. 
  Because of encryption processing, the burden placed on the 
CPU is increased. There are also LSIs being offered for 
encryption processing, but costs are prohibitive when it comes 
to installing them into all of the PCs, and even then, several 
problems remain. Currently, these LSIs are most often used in 
limited areas such as in transmitting encrypted files between 
specified partners. 
  Security countermeasures require expense and man hours, and 
they carry with them the fear of losing the freedom of the open 
system. A balance must be struck between security and 
flexibility. Efforts to study this should be made as early as 
possible. 
<H5>  Key Management and Electronic Seals in the Use of Encryption </H5>
  Encryption is a powerful means of guaranteeing secrecy, but 
somehow having joint use of the same key is a problem. KPS (key 
predistribution system) is being developed as a means of solving 
this problem. Also, electronic seal systems which utilize 
encryption technology are being commercialized. 
<H5>  KPS Allows Joint Use of the Key by Input of the Partner's ID </H5>
  KPS is a system developed by Professor Hideki Imai of Tokyo 
University. The assumption is that individual cards will be 
issued for each user, at which time the ID is set. During 
transmission by encryption, joint use of the key is possible by 
simply entering the partner's ID. Because the IDs can be 
publicly known, management is simple without making mistakes 
about the encryption key data. 
  Currently, Advance markets a system that encrypts and 
decodes 
PC files using KPS. In this system, the DES method has been 
adopted for encryption processing. Because key production and 
DES encryption processing are all done within an IC card, the 
safety is very high. 
<H5>  Electronic Seal Uses ESIGN by NTT </H5>
  NTT Advanced Technology is commercializing an electronic 
seal 
systems. This is a system that uses ESIGN, which is an 
encryption method developed by NTT. It is a system called a 
digital signature, and it applies secret key data as a seal. 
  As with ordinary seals, 1) only the person having that seal 
data can seal the document (it cannot be forged by other people, 
and even the authorized person cannot deny it afterwards), and 
2) if there is tampering in the process of delivering it to the 
partner, there is an electronic means for the receiver side to 
find out if there was tampering. EDI (electronic data 
interchange) is becoming popular, and it will be a very 
important technology for transactions of data, such as vouchers, 
between companies. 
  Although the functional roles of KPS and ESIGN vary, IC card 
systems are used. For this reason, they are expensive when there 
are numerous users using them on a LAN. Because they are not 
matched to the NOS and applications when used on a LAN, KPS and 
ESIGN are not good in terms of processing file units and the 
ease of use.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] For years, the company that manufactured the Zero 
fighter plane and the battleship Musashi enjoyed 
almost-uninterrupted growth, courtesy of Japanese defense 
contracts. 
  Churning out F15 fighters and ground-to-air Patriot missiles 
for the Defense Agency, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rarely had 
to worry about revenue sources or economic downturns. Not only 
were fixed profits guaranteed, the company also knew that it 
would receive a host of new contracts every time the Defense 
Agency's budget rose. 
  But Japan's largest comprehensive heavy-machinery 
manufacturer has found out the hard way that all good things 
must come to an end. With the Cold War over, this behemoth 
corporation, one of the symbols of Japanese industrial prowess, 
is facing similar problems to those besetting arms contractors 
in the U.S. and Russia. 
  For the last three years, annual sales of &yen;2.3-2.4 
trillion ($20-21 billion) have been flat while annual net 
profits have gradually fallen -- to an estimated &yen;70 billion 
in fiscal 1993 through March this year. 
  To reverse the fall, Mitsubishi Heavy's military 
manufacturing sectors are under the gun to find new non-defense 
revenue sources. Given the recession, that's a tough order to 
fill. 
  The company's recipe: cut costs, promote competition within 
the firm, start research on new private-sector products and 
inculcate a sense of urgency in complacent arms-manufacturing 
employees. 


  The results so far: mixed. 
  ``We've got to use our brains harder to expand new business 
opportunities,'' company President Kentaro Aikawa told managers 
last September during a visit to Mitsubishi Heavy's two 
principal arms-manufacturing centers in Nagoya, which rely on 
Defense Agency contracts for 70-80% of all orders. The 
Defense 
Agency's fiscal 1994 budget, set to be determined later this 
month, is likely to be flat. 
  With the endorsement of Aikawa, known within the company as 
``Mr. Cost-down,'' a new deputy chief, Shiro Goda, was appointed 
at the company's guided-propulsion-systems center to shake up 
the staff. 
  ``Goda's appointment was designed to equip the center for 
survival in the private sector by infusing traditional technical 
skills with a new commercial awareness,'' explained a senior 
official. 
  The goal is to develop high-quality products such as 
commercial airplanes at competitive prices, a new concept at a 
center used to having almost unlimited funds with which to build 
ships and planes at taxpayers' expense. 
  As one of his first acts, Goda reduced the center's nine 
divisions to six and slimmed down its 45 sections to 38, giving 
impetus to the decision-making process and to the 
commercialization of new products. 
  ``I was surprised to find that most of the 2,000 staff who 
work here at the Nagoya center are really quiet,'' said Goda. 
``They are not challenging, not aggressive; they are more like 
government officials.'' 
  Indeed, according to analysts, many Mitsubishi Heavy 
executives view themselves as quasi-government officials, so 
closely is the company tied to the government teat. 
  As a whole, about half of the company's orders come from the 
central and local governments or from semi-governmental 
institutions such as public utilities. About half of its 
&yen;120 billion annual research and development budget is also 
derived from governmental institutions. Mitsubishi Heavy's 
corporate slogan -- ``To walk with the nation'' -- also reflects 
the close ties. 
<H5>  Divisional Changes </H5>
  The company's electronics division reflects the new emphasis 
on private-sector business. 
  The division was long operated as an R&amp;D division but 
was 
transformed a year ago into a marketing and sales division. All 
300 engineers in the division are expected to work as sales 
engineers, responding to customers' demands and requests. 
  This fiscal year, the division expects to receive some 
&yen;5 
billion worth of orders. While that's only a fraction of total 
annual sales, division General Manager Kenzo Noguchi said he's 
happy that the division is gradually combining the three 
functions of research, production and sales. 
  For one of the company's core divisions, shipbuilding, the 
transition has been rougher. Twenty years ago, the division 
accounted for half the value of all company orders. By last 
year, that had fallen to less than 18% of orders, with 
little 
hope for improvement in the near future. 
  In contrast, the company's power-systems division, which 
makes power plants, has gradually increased its sales, profits 
and corporate influence by promoting intense internal 
competition between factories. 
  The company's past three presidents, including Aikawa, all 
belonged at one time to this division, which last year generated 
27% of total sales. 
  Among contracts the power-systems division won last year 
were 
for a &yen;60 billion integrated electric-power generating plant 
in Syria, a &yen;20 billion coal-fired power plant in Chile and 
contracts for thermal power stations in the Philippines and 
Saudi Arabia. 
  Much of the credit for the power-systems division's 
profitability goes to Yotaro Iida, now the company's chairman. 
  ``Mitsubishi Heavy can survive even if the yen surges to 100 
to the dollar,'' Iida said recently. 
  The secret of the division's competitiveness lies in 
management's decision to allow related sections and factories to 
compete with each other for outside orders, explained Tomozuchi 
Kawamura, the division's general manager. ``Such tough in-house 
competition has enabled the division to grow stronger and more 
powerful on the international bidding scene,'' he said. 
  For Mitsubishi Heavy, the quality of technology is less a 
problem than how to apply it to new products. 
  Worldwide, the company's reputation for developing excellent 
products dates to the late 19th century when the firm's 
predecessor made most of Japan's fleet. 
  As the core of the heavy industry division of the prewar 
Mitsubishi zaibatsu, the company was a leading 
munitions maker until its dissolution in 1950. It regrouped in 
its current form in 1964. 
  Among the company's latest technological accomplishments is 
the Yamato 1, the world's first ship to use superconducting 
magneto-hydrodynamic direct drives. In June 1992, the vessel 
successfully completed a test voyage in Kobe Bay. 
  ``The key to R&amp;D is the ability to go beyond the problem 
barrier,'' said Hiroshi Sakai, chief engineer at the company's 
Kobe Shipyard. 
<H5>  Risks as Challenges </H5>
  For Kuniichi Kanda, project manager on the FSX, the 
next-generation fighter being developed by Japan and the U.S., 
the greatest task is keeping development costs down. 
  Kanda, who works at the company's Nagoya aerospace systems 
factory, said he has managed to do this in part by using data 
from tests already carried out on similar fighters already in 
existence. 
  ``Without such savings, development costs would have been 
three times as high as they are now,'' Kanda said. 
  To President Aikawa, knowledge of what it takes to succeed 
in 
technical fields is what's needed to succeed in business as well. 
  ``The ability to see risks as challenges is what stops the 
technical manager from being a mere administrator,'' said Aikawa. 
  He said he hoped that completion this spring of a new 
R&amp;D 
center in Yokohama would enable different kinds of engineers 
from different divisions to brainstorm and to come up with new 
ideas from basic research that can be commercialized. The center 
will absorb 2,600 engineers from different divisions, a large 
percentage of the company's R&amp;D staff. About 10% of 
the 
company's more than 45,000 employees are assigned to R&amp;D 
activities.

<F P=106> [Article by Noboru Ikeda, editor, JAPAN 21ST] </F>
  [Text] The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development 
Organization (NEDO) participated in ``POLLUTEC '93 + Energies 
'93,'' held for four days from October 12 at the Porte de 
Versailles Trade Fair Ground in Paris. This was the first time 
that NEDO took part in an overseas exposition. 
  As a public organization taking charge of national 
technology 
development projects, NEDO had refrained, as far as possible 
until then, from carrying out any form of PR activity akin to a 
private sector company's publicity. Its recent participation in 
the Paris event was aimed at breaking the fetters of convention 
and contributing to the creation of opportunities for 
international technology exchanges by widely publicizing its 
activities at home and abroad, in view of the need of its 
expanding international contributions in recent years in the 
midst of growing worldwide expectations for Japan's 
contributions to the world community. 
  POLLUTEC, one of the largest environmental equipment 
expositions in Europe, has traditionally been held in a local 
French city. 
  However, POLLUTEC '93 took place in the French capital 
because concern about environmental problems is growing to an 
unprecedentedly high degree in Europe against backdrop 
developments such as progressive formulation of common 
environment control plans for the European Community and the 
enhancement of environmental protection consciousness following 
the Earth Summit in Brazil and EC integration. Another 
remarkable fact about this event was that for the first time it 
combined with ``Energies '93,'' an energy-saving 
technology-related exposition hosted by ADEME (Environmental and 
Energy Management Agency), a French government-affiliated 
organization, to become a new comprehensive environmental 
protection technology exposition. This was one of the reasons 
why NEDO chose POLLUTEC '93 for its first overseas show. 
  NEDO this April launched the ``New Sunshine Project'' with 
energy-saving technology development and global environment 
conservation technology added, as new research themes, to the 
hitherto development of new energy technology. As a result, 
energy technology was given a more important position in 
POLLUTEC '93 through the participation of ADEME, with which NEDO 
has had exchanges for years as a similar governmental 
organization. This created an optimum climate for NEDO's 
participation in the event. 
  Partly because of its debut, NEDO confined its participation 
to a display of panels showing the technology research efforts 
it has exerted in the past and the results, and the distribution 
of pamphlets. For all this, the NEDO booth attracted many 
visitors. It was, for example, the only foreign booth, except 
for the booth run by Tunisia, with which France has 
traditionally maintained close relations, visited on the opening 
day by Michel Barnier, French Minister for the Environment. 
Given this, NEDO's first-time participation may well be 
described as a success. 
  ``It was very lucky that a French minister visited our 
booth, 
but we are sorry to learn that people abroad knew less about 
NEDO than we had imagined,'' said people associated with NEDO 
after the show. 
  This is not just the case with NEDO. 
  Japan is a world-leader in international contributions in 
terms of technological assistance and international research 
exchanges, as well as ODA, but the contents of such activities 
are not generally known overseas. This is because the Japanese 
government has not in the past vigorously conducted PR 
activities. At present, there are still voices abroad claiming 
Japan's contributions to the world community are inadequate. 
Therefore, the government recently decided to put a great deal 
of effort into PR activities. 
  In this context, it is extremely significant that NEDO 
participated in ``POLLUTEC '93 + Energies '93.'' The steady 
accumulation of such activities will certainly produce the 
desired results. It is, therefore, ardently hoped that NEDO will 
continue to avail itself of overseas events to demonstrate its 
activities.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Motors has spent years developing 
internal combustion engines and electric vehicles in the pursuit 
of technology that achieves a balance among energy savings, 
cleanliness, and mobility. With the ESR, we have developed an 
advanced experimental research vehicle that, through the 
implementation of revolutionary new technology, realizes a 
superior combination of these factors. 
  The ESR uses a high-efficiency compact electric generating 
plant -- composed of batteries, an electric motor, an engine, 
and an electricity generator. This system gives the ESR an 
energy consumption rate superior to either combustion engines or 
conventional electric vehicles. 
  ESR employs the Series Hybrid Electric system, with which 
the 
vehicle is always driven by an electric motor. The Series Hybrid 
Electric system is known as the most efficient among hybrid 
systems with two driving modes. The first is battery-operated 
mode, in which batteries supply energy to an electric motor. 
This driving mode has zero emissions. Second is hybrid mode, in 
which an on-board electric generating plant supplies power to 
the electric motor when the batteries run low. 
<H5>  Energy Savings &amp; Clean Air </H5>
  -- A compact, lightweight AC induction motor and motor 
controllers assure highly efficient motor operation with 
excellent response at low and high speeds. 
  -- The 1.5-litre petrol engine developed specifically for 
generating electricity incorporates the optimized inner cylinder 
gas flow technology that is the base of our MVV (Mitsubishi 
Vertical Vortex) engine. This water-cooled in-line 4-cylinder 
engine has a high expansion-ratio cycle. The engine runs at a 
constant speed to achieve both high efficiency and the cleanest 
possible exhaust emissions. 
  -- A highly-efficient, light, and compact AC generator has 
been adopted. Also, a turbo generator has been employed to 
convert exhaust energy into electricity. 
  -- An energy regenerative brake system is available to 
convert the vehicle's kinetic energy into electricity to charge 
the batteries. In addition, solar cells are built into the roof 
to generate electricity from sunlight. 
  -- Assisted by Mitsubishi Motors' proprietary navigation 
system, ESR will always operate in Battery-operated Mode in 
areas near hospitals and schools to achieve zero exhaust 
emissions. The electrically heated catalyst system achieves 
ultra-low exhaust emissions even in Hybrid Mode. 

<H5>    Mobility </H5>
  -- The adoption of highly efficient alkaline batteries, a 
lightweight body design, and reduction of drag and rolling 
resistance make a range of 500 km or more possible in 
Battery-operated Mode. (At 40 km/h constant speed on a flat 
road) Hybrid Mode provides a far greater driving range. 
  -- ESR is equipped with a fuzzy logic control automatic 
transmission with three driving positions. 
<H5>  Recycling </H5>
  -- During the development of ESR, we gave consideration to 
the recovery of used batteries, while also researching possible 
ways of recycling the motor and controller.

<F P=106> [Article by Takeo Matsuoka, staff writer, JAPAN 21ST] </F>
  [Text] The Tokyo Motor Show, the auto industry's biggest 
event, got under way on 23 October at the Nippon Convention 
Center (Makuhari Messe) in Chiba Prefecture. Reflecting the 
persisting recession, there is no festive mood in this year's 
show, like past events; this year's event feels just like a mere 
exhibition of new cars. 
  This is apparently because all participating automakers are 
emphasizing the promotion of their ``sales strategies'' in a 
frantic attempt to get visitors to buy by displaying a wide 
array of new models that fully meet the practical needs of 
today's drivers. 
  Despite such calculations, however, response to exhibits 
remains low. 
  Can the show really help revitalize the recession-hit auto 
industry? 
  Indications are that sales of new-model cars in 1993 
(excepting registered cars and light motor vehicles) will fall 
to an estimated 5 million units -- the 1988 level. This means 
that the industry will suffer a sales setback below the previous 
year's level for three years in a row. 
  Prospects for an early demand recovery are, therefore, dim 
and the makers' ``sense of crisis'' is duly reflected in the 
motor show. 
  This is eloquently endorsed by the remarks of the industry's 
top management. ``The business climate surrounding our industry 
is so severe that we have been forced to revise domestic demand 
to about 5 million units. We, therefore, want the show to give a 
shot in the arm to the industry,'' said Tatsuro Toyoda, 
president of Toyota Motor Corp. 
  In the same vein, Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor 
Co., Ltd., observed, ``We had expected sales to rebounce from 
the second half of this year, but there is still no sign of 
sales improving. In such circumstances, we must do our utmost to 
promote demand recovery through participation in the motor 
show.'' 
  They, therefore, expect much from this year's show, which 
they hope will be the catalyst that stimulates demand. 
  The exhibition halls are fender-to-fender with new models, 
including Toyota's ``Celica,'' Nissan's ``Skyline'' and Honda's 
``Accord.'' The remarkable fact about this year's show is that 
there is not one luxurious ``futuristic'' model on display. 
  Approaches to the event carry according to maker. Toshihiro 
Wada, president of Mazda Motor Corp., for example, emphasized, 
``Public concern with problems directly related to everyday 
life, such as the environment, safety and energy, continues to 
assume serious proportions. We, therefore, designed our concept 
cars for exhibition with these concerns in mind.'' 
  Osamu Suzuki, president of Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., said, 
``Electric cars are our concept vehicles. We have exhibited new 
models we are currently selling.'' 
  Concept cars are invariably designed using state-of-the-art 
technology, with concern for the environment and safety 
uppermost in designers' minds. These cars are in themselves a 
reflection on makers' strategies to stimulate sales. 
  No doubt, for the recession-plagued auto industry, the motor 
show is a golden opportunity to promote sales. 
  ``The event is extremely significant in that all makers 
participate. It is an opportunity to have the public take a 
fresh look at their products, principally the latest models,'' 
stressed a top automaker executive. 
  Meanwhile, the Toyota president pointed out, ``There is a 
definite need to make the most of the event in finding a way out 
of the current recession by stimulating consumer confidence. 
This is why we have our new models at the show.'' 
  Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association and also chairman of Japan Motor Industrial 
Federation, Inc. (JMIF), which hosts the Tokyo Motor Show, said, 
``There are at present few signs that suggest an early recovery 
in car sales. I, therefore, hope that new cars at the show will 
appeal to the visiting public.'' 
  Automakers hope this year's show will help jumpstart the 
industry out of the lingering recession and get it back on the 
road to stable growth in and after next year.

  [Text] The liquid crystal industry is rushing into a new 
era. Color TFT, the leader, has abruptly changed the market, 
panel technology, and materials and components technologies. If 
the last four to five years were the start-up phase of the first 
generation, the next few years will be second generation which 
will be an active period. In the market, the spread of new 
useful situations like mobile computing and green personal 
computers has a strong affect on the spread of liquid crystal. 
Liquid crystals will also be widely spread by the full-scale 
realization of small-sized video games and car navigation. To 
respond to these demands, there will be rapid progress in 
lowering the power consumption, widening the visual field, and 
lowering the reflectance of the panels. Power consumption will 
be 1W per VGA panel, wide viewing angle technology will become 
mass production technology, and products with vertical viewing 
angles of 80 will become common. A 2% surface 
reflectance 
has been achieved. Term 2 lines bet on by leading major panel 
manufacturers will begin operation in 1994 with the goal of 
three times the productivity as term 1 lines. Components and 
materials will move towards lower prices and get into full gear. 
New technologies like unpolished glass substrates will appear 
one after another.

  LCD production is rushing headlong into the new phase called 
the second generation. The applications market, the panel 
technology, and the components and materials technologies have 
all changed dramatically. In addition to conventional notebook 
computers in the applications market, the performance of TFT 
color LCDs matches the new trends of mobile computing and green 
PCs. Moreover, the market base for the full-scale realization of 
car navigation will expand. Therefore, the development of panel 
technology for these applications is very active. Low power 
consumption, wide viewing angle, and low reflectance 
technologies are beginning to be applied to mass-produced 
panels. In order to expand the market, price reductions will 
continue for components and materials to reach &yen;50,000 for 
10-inch models by 1995. 
  According to Isamu Washizuka, Sharp's executive director, 
LCD 
production is ``at the brink of rushing headlong into the second 
generation.'' The formation of a business base centered on TFT 
LCDs was completed in 1993. Hiroshi Shiba, NEC's executive 
director, believes the ``period of rapid progress'' will finally 
arrive in 1994. The production line for the second generation is 
starting and will, according to Koichi Suzuki, manager of 
Toshiba's Liquid Crystal Department, ``give form to new 
applications'' that will certainly reach one billion yen in 
production. 
  LCD production began a few years before 1993.[.sup]1[/] If 
those years are designated the first generation of TFT color 
LCDs, the next few years beginning in 1994 will be the era of 
the second generation. The reason is the abrupt change in the 
applications market, panel technology, and components and 
materials technologies. 
<H3>  Dramatic change in the market, panel technology, and 
components and materials technologies </H3>
  In the applications market, in addition to laptop and 
notebook personal computers and compact portable televisions, 
the core of the TFT color LCD market in the first generation, 
the market is strongly advancing with products that incorporate 
new ideas about mobile computing in the second generation (Figs. 
1 and 2). The market will expand for TFT LCD camera video and 
portable game devices, as well as for vehicle-installed market 
through the realization of car navigation. 






  In order to provide energy savings in offices and to avoid 
the spread of electromagnetic radiation that is becoming a 
problem of CRTs, desktop personal computers that use TFT LCDs 
have appeared in accordance with the Energy Star Program in the 
United States. Even in the desktop world where CRTs are 
unrivaled, the conversion to color TFTs will gain headway in the 
future. 
  According to a survey conducted by the Japan Electronic 
Machinery Manufacturer's Association, if the price of color TFTs 
for 10-inch VGA (640x480 pixels) becomes &yen;60,000, the scale 
of that year's demand will approach &yen;800 
billion.[.sup]2[/] Only TFT color LCDs will reach one 
trillion yen in 1996. 
  In addition to advancing towards mobility, panel technology 
will improve the visibility and enhance the portability, then it 
will be applied to mass production (Fig. 3). Advances in low 
power consumption are continuing to realize portability and in 
wider viewing angles and lower reflectance for better visibility. 



  To expand the market, panel manufacturers will start term 2 
lines which are full-scale mass production lines in 1994 (Table 
1). To lower the costs of the panels to be produced, in addition 
to improving line productivity and yield, lowering the prices of 
parts and materials will become decisive. These hard to decrease 
prices will finally begin to fall in 1994 (Fig. 4).

<H5>  The LCD market opened up by mobile and green PCs </H5>
  In the future, information devices that can be used 
``anytime, anywhere, by anyone'' will open up a large market 
directed at individuals. A concrete image of the mobile 
computing to accomplish this has appeared. Regardless of whether 
thinness, light weight, low consumption power, and rich 
expressive power for implementing portability are obtained, 
there will be no expansion without color LCD panels. 
  Improving the portability of conventional personal computers 
was clearly shown in the marketing of subnotebook computers 
which are more compact than notebook computers. IBM Japan began 
to manufacture ThinkPad 220 last May. It uses a 7.7-inch, 
VGA-compatible STN-monochrome LCD manufactured by Kyocera. As a 
result, Chikara Maruyama, executive director of the Personal 
Systems Division of IBM Japan Information Systems, stated the 
true meaning is the move into high-level personal computers that 
can be carried around. 
  Of course, the Windows operating system and applications 
used 
on desktop personal computers will be used unchanged and the 
office environment can be reproduced anywhere. LCD panels 
somewhat smaller than conventional 10-inch class are used. In 
the 10-inch class, the 8.4-inch panel from Sharp can be diverted 
unchanged for use in subnotebooks. 
  On the other hand, personal digital assistants (PDA), the 
electronic notebooks, also were beginning to appear on the 
market in 1993. MessagePad from Apple Computer, Inc. in the US 
seems to be getting underway favorably with orders for several 
thousand a week since they went on sale in August.[.sup]3[/] 
Sharp's PI-3000 is a portable information device for everyday 
use. The &yen;65,000 price will be cheaper than those of 
conventional products and enter the same price range as advanced 
system notebooks.[.sup]4[/] Although it can be only used as 
at close distances, an infrared data communication function is 
also supplied. 
  Still, STN-monochrome displays are the only displays used in 
the PDA field. If viewed by eyes accustomed to the office 
environment that is moving towards color, Katsuichi Tomida, 
sales promotion manager at NEC Personal Computer Sales 
Promotion, feels it is obvious that ``these monochrome displays 
will become unsatisfactory within the next one to two years.'' 
Even with price concessions, Sharp's Mr. Washizuka believes 
``the wave towards color TFTs will even advance into portable 
information devices.'' 
  The trend of green computers that considers energy savings 
in 
offices and improved environmental conservation is strong 
motivation for converting the CRTs in desktop computers to TFT 
color LCDs.[.sup]5[/] In the future, Mr. Maruyama of IBM 
Japan's Information Systems sees these trends ``gradually 
expanding and permeating'' throughout the world under government 
direction. This is a model market example capable of 
demonstrating the true value of LCD panels. In addition, new 
proposals are also appearing where LCDs will eat into the 
desktop market but not as replacements (see pp. 74-75 for 
details). 
<H5>  Outdoor measures that adopt new technologies </H5>
  Even in the amusement field, the demand for carrying 
displays 
outdoors has become strong. The demand for color was strong from 
the beginning. In contrast to character-based PDAs that transmit 
information, the objective is to enjoy images and graphics. In 
addition to portability, moving images and full-color screens 
are demanded. TFT color LCDs are being advanced by PDAs at this 
time. 
  New technologies were installed in the LCD ViewCam made by 
Sharp for full-scale outdoor use. One technology is 
antireflective processing of the screen's surface by multilayer 
film to prevent the reflection of external light.[.sup]6[/] 
According to Yoshio Okano, Sharp's A1176 Project team leader, 
anti-flare processing in conventional OA ``cannot handle strong 
sunlight.''[.sup]7[/] Also, a semihot tube with low power 
consumption was used in the backlight lamp for high luminance; 
an Ushio Denki product is used. 
  The realization of the car navigation market was apparent. 
The market scale was 150,000 to 160,000 units/year in 1993; this 
will rapidly expand to about 500,000 units/year in 1995 and one 
million units/year in 2000 (Matsushita Communications 
Industries). Since a prerequisite of navigation systems is use 
will be in narrow vehicles and highly accurate color is required 
in displays of map information, TFT color LCDs will be used. 
  Although today the only function available confirms the 
position of the vehicle on a screen, in addition to the 
infrastructure provisions of traffic information like vehicle 
information and communication systems (VICS), more varied 
service can be provided.[.sup]8[/] Based on this, market 
expansion can be expected by opening the market beyond the 
conventional navigation function. 
  Furthermore, by combining with the cellular phone network, 
individual data communication becomes possible and the car 
becomes a ``moving office'' (Susumu Nakata, business manager of 
Automotive Devices Division of Matsushita Communications). 
Because the developments for information systems that accomplish 
the uses of personal computers can be expected, the market 
expansion effect will be huge for TFT color LCDs. 
<H5>  Advances in portable technology and lower costs </H5>
  In panel technology aimed at these markets, low power 
consumption that reached 1W in VGA-compatible panels and a 
2% 
screen reflectance made outdoor use possible (for details see 
``Rapid Advances of TFT in the Second Generation: Reflective 
Color To Be Marketed by 1996,'' pp. 76-82). 
  Term 2 lines of major panel manufacturers will finally start 
up one after another beginning in 1994 (see the article on pp. 
71-73). In these lines, productivity will be three times better 
than term 1 lines. In addition, the mother glass will be larger 
and the processing capacity of the production equipment will be 
increased substantially. 
  In order to achieve the &yen;50,000 goal for 10-inch panels 
in 1995, the prices of materials and components which were 
difficult to decrease from 1991 to 1993 will finally begin to 
decrease by 20% annually. The material manufacturers will 
introduce new technology that can decrease costs in each field 
(see ``Successive Technologies Like Unpolished Glass Target 
&yen;50,000 Panels'' on pp. 83-87). The application to mass 
production will begin sometime in 1994. 
Footnotes 
  1. After the triumph of TFT color LCDs over the various 
types 
of flat-panel displays in 1990, investments were made to begin 
operating large-scale mass production factories. The ability to 
obtain over 50% yield in large-scale lines was confirmed 
by 
1992. The market rapidly expanded in 1993 primarily because of 
notebook personal computers. The 1993 production costs for TFT 
LCDs at Sharp, the largest LCD maker, are &yen;100 billion. This 
was the first sign of a reversal from simple matrix models 
centered for STNs costing on 75 billion yen. 
  2. ``R&amp;D Report on the Year 2000 Vision for Electronic 
Display Production,'' Japan Electronic Machinery 
Manufacturers Association, pp. 1-26, July 1993. 
  3. Manufactured by Sharp. The same product is marketed in 
the 
United States under the name ExpertPad. 
  4. The Bible-sized advanced system notebook from Philo Fax 
Ltd. in the UK is prices at &yen;150,000. The usual price range 
for advanced products is from &yen;50,000 to &yen;60,000. 
Popular products are &yen;10,000 to &yen;30,000. 
  5. This is the name of the series of low-power consumption 
personal computers developed at IBM Co. in the US in accordance 
with the Energy Star Program of the US Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
  6. This method prevents reflection by forming multiple films 
on a polarizer of the liquid crystal module by vapor deposition 
and lowers the reflection of external light. 
  7. Although this method prevents the reflection of external 
light as in antireflective processing, the unevenness on the 
surface of the screen in this method and scatters reflected 
light. Therefore, production is less costly, but there are the 
problems of a decrease in the effect of decreasing reflected 
light, lower panel transmittance, and lower resolution of the 
screen. 
  8. This system supplies in real-time traffic information to 
drivers and is promoted by the National Police Agency, Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of 
Construction. Traffic congestion information, accident 
information, regulation information, and parking information are 
included in the data. Information is supplied by radio by 
beacons, multiplexed FM transmission, and tele-terminals. A 
navigation system equipped with a communication terminal is 
required at the receiver. With the objective of full-scale 
operation in 1995, the related ministries and agencies are 
consulting with each other. 
<H3>  Rapid Advances of TFT in the Second Generation: Reflective 
Color To Be Marketed by 1996 </H3>
<H5>  Isamu Washizuka, Executive Director at Sharp </H5>
  LCDs have entered the second generation. During the first 
generation which began in 1988, TFT color LCDs matured while 
contributing to STN LCDs. In the future, TFTs will advance 
rapidly not as simple parts, but for widespread use as important 
components in products (Fig. A). 



  In 1996, the TFT market will exceed &yen;700 billion. 
Seventy 
percent will be VGA or half VGA (320x240 pixels) screens. The 
price of 10-inch models will without a doubt become &yen;50,000 
by the end of 1995 to 1996, and a total of 10 million units will 
be sold annually. 
  There are two major sources of energy at work in the LCD 
industry as we move towards this 1996 market. The first is 
development to replace CRT monitors larger than 10.4 inches. 
Because of activity to promote energy conservation by office 
automation equipment in Europe and in the United States, using 
LCDs in desktop monitors has become important. Since it is 
possible both VGA and XGA will be required, the preparation of 
XGA panels must be guaranteed. 
  The second source is the development of reflective color for 
portable information terminals, like PDAs. To ensure 
portability, backlights must not be used and power consumption 
must be on the order of milliwatts. The development of internal 
drivers by low temperature polycrystalline Si is indispensable. 
Even in areas where 6- or 7-inch VGA or half VGA panels are 
used, TFTs are likely winners. 
<H3>  Reviving LSI Technology Supporting Both High Image Quality 
and Low Cost </H3>
<H5>  Hiroshi Shiba, Executive Director at NEC </H5>
  TFT color LCDs will become a major product for the next 
dozen 
years and the future is truly looked forward to. While laying 
the foundation of the business lasted through 1993, the plan is 
to launch stabilization and expansion in 1994 (Fig. B). Since 
personal computers are steadily becoming notebook sized and 
gaining color, the urgency is great. The term 2 line at 
Kagoshima was settled in three months and operations began in 
December 1993. Investment up to 1996 will total 110 billion yen 
and a system will be established for a monthly production of 170 
to 180 thousand panels at the shipping base. 



  Next, effort will be made to develop audio visual equipment 
using analog full-color technology. Since polishing is performed 
in conventional LCD technology, the business of panels for OA 
equipment has shrunk. In the future, the image field including 
multimedia will be reclaimed. For example, 6.5-inch VGA panels 
for use in subnotebooks can also be used in high-resolution 
personal televisions. 
  Basically, LSI technology that has been fostered is used 
freely and will coexist with lowering costs while pursuing 
highest image quality. Therefore, when the panel has as simple a 
structure as possible, the burden of improving the images is on 
LSI. Since the price of an LSI is determined by its chip area, 
no matter how good the circuitry's performance is, costs can be 
reduced if size is reduced. Although the reliance on parts is 
the same at other companies, LSI is a unique field where as much 
invention as possible occurs. 
<H3>  Three Times the Productivity Confirmed for the Term 2 Line: 
Largest Panel Size with 4 Bevels </H3>
<H5>  Koichi Suzuki, Manager in Toshiba's LCD Division </H5>
  In 1994, LCD panels will begin to directly respond to new 
demands. The second generation line will start and a new market 
will be created (Fig. C). 



  The established goal was to realize three times the 
productivity in the term 2 line. Verification took place in the 
prototype line at the Fukaya Works. By improving productivity, 
1.5 million 9.4-inch panels can be shipped annually by DTI's 
term 2 line. The term 3 line will have larger glass substrates 
and five times the productivity of the term 1 line is expected. 
However, the operating period will probably be 1997 at the 
earliest. Equipment development will not catch up. The term 2.5 
line is designed to fill the gap. Glass substrate dimensions are 
not changed from the term 2 line. 
  The 1995 target of &yen;50,000 for only the 10-inch class 
has 
the productivity of the term 2 line. Moreover, its realization 
is possible with the added condition of a decrease in the price 
of color filters. In fact, the prices of color filters are not 
decreasing at all. Therefore, purchasing from outside is also 
expected in the future. 
  As expected, 9.4-inch VGA panels for notebook personal 
computers will continue to be the royal road. But users demand 
large panels like the 10.4-inch panel in IBM's ThinkPad. In 
order to have panels that are as large as possible within an 
A4-sized frame, the largest panel size having 4 bevels from 
360x465 mm[.sup]2[/] is also being studied. 
<H3>  The Multiple Display System: Proposal for a New Use of LCD 
Panels </H3>
<H5>  Norihiko Naono </H5>
  A display system is proposed that is flexibly expandable by 
software. The objective is to satisfy the demands of the users 
of operating system with multitasking environments like Windows. 
  Multiple applications can be used simultaneously in multiple 
windows in a multitasking environment. However, a large area, 
high resolution display is required and the price of this kind 
of CRT monitor remains high. 
  We come to only think of the form of one display in one 
computer. This display is suited to the desk in a GUI 
environment. If many documents are opened on a narrow desk, work 
efficiency drops. Buying a large desk as a replacement is good, 
however, a high price must be tolerated. The fundamental idea 
behind this system is to provide a winged desk corresponding to 
the task. Thin, lightweight LCDs are suited to this task. 
  Fig. D shows a specific product conception. In this system, 
work is possible while simultaneously looking at displays of 
different windows. The program manager, calculator, and schedule 
management is normally displayed on a small display. The 
wordprocessor and spreadsheet can be displayed in separate 
windows, and a both can be referenced when documents and graphs 
are created. By buying a large monitor, new area can be obtained 
inexpensively. 



  This system does not require particularly new technology. An 
interface card equipped with multiple display controllers and 
Windows display drivers is acceptable. Only board design and 
building drivers are required. The huge desktop PC AT market 
will immediately become a new application market for LCD panels. 
Memory and hard disks can be expanded in response to need, only 
excluding the display is unreasonable. If this system is 
accepted, I believe an extremely large market can be cultivated. 
Note. 
  This proposal is currently being investigated. For a 
detailed 
discussion, see Flat Panel Displays 1994 (Nikkei BP) 
and the report from the Nomura Research Institute to be 
published in February. 
<H5>  Part 2. Panel Technology </H5>
<H3>  The Push to 1W Power Consumption and Wide Viewing Angles in 
Mass-Produced Products </H3>
<H5>  Term 2 line targets three times the productivity </H5>
<H5>  Hiroshi Asakura </H5>

  By combining TFT color LCDs with the second generation 
application environment that stresses portability and high 
visibility, lower power consumption, wider viewing angles, and 
lower reflection are rapidly advancing. VGA panels with a low 
1.5W power consumption have been implemented and is entering the 
stage where portable use is possible. Wide viewing angle 
technology that achieves about twice the conventional viewing 
angle is increasingly being installed in mass-produced panels. 
Low reflectance reached 2%, one-tenth the conventional 
reflectance. The objective was to achieve the goal of increasing 
the productivity of the mass production line to three times that 
of the term 1 line. The evaluation of the wafer processing 
equipment that handles the 4-beveled glass substrate has ended 
and an 80% yield seems possible. 
  TFT color LCD panel technology will be dramatically 
different 
in the second generation. With the appearance of mobile 
computing, the use environment is changing from the fixed 
environment on a desk to the mobile environment that is carried 
outdoors. TFT panels are spurring portability and improved 
visibility (Fig. 1). 
  To improve portability, lower power consumption is being 
advanced to extend the battery drive time in particular. The 
power consumption of TFT panels is cut in half by using one 
backlight instead of two. Cuts of 2W in VGA panels are appearing. 



  The technology revolution in wider viewing angles and lower 
reflectance for improving visual confirmation is remarkable. 
Since a wider viewing angle is ``required in portable devices 
where the viewing angle differs with the use,'' asserts Seiya 
Hijikawa, a director at Sharp, each company is quickly moving to 
the mass production of panels. Without accelerating the process, 
mass production of technology that doubles the visual angle will 
follow in 1994. Lowering the reflectance will be indispensable 
technology particularly for use in an outdoor environment. The 
technology to lower the surface reflectance to 1/10 is suited to 
products. 
  The term 2 lines of major panel manufacturers that include 
these technologies will finally be operating in 1994 (Fig. 2). 
The industry objective of &yen;50,000 10-inch VGA panels in 1995 
will be achieved and productivity will improve significantly. 
The aim was a three-fold improvement in productivity over the 
term 1 lines. 



<H5>  From one backlight to reflective color </H5>
  The TFT panel's backlight is being converted to one 
fluorescent light; this will cut power consumption in half in 
second generation panels. By pursuing better image quality, 
luminance is sacrificed, but designs that stress low power 
consumption are encouraged. 
  Sharp has a 6.4-inch, VGA-compatible color panel with a 
converging lens film that produces an image luminance of 70 
cd/m[.sup]2[/] using only 1.5W. The vignetting factor of a 
TFT panel is 35%. Mass production will begin in the 
middle of 
1994. In the future, Sharp will increase the vignetting factor 
to 40%. Given the objective of a less than 1W reflective 
STN-monochrome that can be driven by a genuine dry cell battery 
drive, Isamu Washizuka, Sharp's executive director, has handed 
down the order to ``quickly develop a reflective color panel 
that does not use backlights.'' He expressed the desire ``to see 
its realization using the TFT method by 1996.'' 
  Casio Computer attracted attention by exhibiting a 
reflective 
color panel at Electronics Show '93. Since the reverse of the 
coloring effect is used by the double diffraction effect of an 
STN LCD, colors are changed by the magnitude of the voltage. 
According to Susumu Mineo, executive director of Casio Computer, 
a 64x64 dot matrix display has already been implemented (Fig. 3) 
and will be marketed in the fall of 1994. Its power consumption 
is that same as that of reflective STN-monochrome. 



<H3>  Mass production at each company moves towards wide viewing 
angle panels </H3>
  After 1994, the mass production of wide viewing angle panels 
will follow. Until now, techniques where the production process 
becomes complex were applied to a portion of high quality 
panels. However, processes that are not processes added in the 
second generation have been developed for mass-produced panels 
(Table 1).

When the viewing angle is not specified, the contrast condition is 5:1. *1 indicates the range where there is no intensity level reversal. *2 means the product specifications do not 
entirely match. *3 is the contrast condition of 10:1. *4 is a joint development by Tokyo Noko University and Stanley Electric. *5 indicates the premise of the edges of opposite poles 
are patterned by an exposure process. *6 is the contrast condition of 30:1. *7 indicated the same specifications announced by Tektronix in the US. 


  Both Sharp and Sanyo Denki used conventional equipment 
unchanged and developed technology to widen the viewing angle 
without expanding the process. Sharp only changed the molding 
process conditions for oriented film and increased the vertical 
viewing angle to 80. Beginning in the spring of 1994, this 
process will be adopted in products (see article on p. 79). 
Sanyo Denki uses a method to expand the vertical viewing angle 
to 100 by only changing the opposing poles' mask patterns. 
  Panel reflectance will be instantly lowered to 1/10 in the 
second generation. Processing was developed to prevent 
reflection by the black matrix that produced the largest 
reflectance so far and by the polarizer. The black matrix was 
one layer of conventional chromium (Cr), but has a lower 
reflectance in a two-layered structure with Cr oxidized film. 
Reflection prevention for the polarizer is an effective method 
where an inorganic film is formed by multilayered vapor 
deposition. A method to remove the protective layer on the front 
surface was also fabricated (see article on p. 80). Since the 
multilayered vapor deposition process is a batch process, the 
manufacturing cost of the polarizer jumps up three- to ten-fold 
depending on the production quantity. Future development of the 
coating method for the multilayered film will be active from the 
cost side. 
<H5>  Three-fold productivity improvement realized in term 2 line </H5>
  Term 2 lines for TFT panels that will operate in 1994 will 
immediately improve productivity by three fold. The evaluation 
of equipment where the 9.4-inch panel has 4 bevels is almost 
finished. Koichi Suzuki, manager in Toshiba's Liquid Crystal 
Department, is confident that the three-fold improvement in 
productivity can be proven in the prototype line. Then, in the 
term 3 lines, the objectives will be for each company to make 
larger substrates and line fabrication with 6 to 9 bevels for 
the 10-inch class (see pp. 81-82 for details). 
<H3>  Technology To Widen Viewing Angle Stressed Productivity and 
Multi Domain Model Doubled the Vertical Viewing Angle </H3>
<H3>  Shigemitsu Mizushima, Sharp Liquid Crystal Division, TFT 
Development Center </H3>
  Technology is being developed to widen the viewing angle of 
TFT color LCD panels that maintain exceptional productivity with 
the goal of implementing them by the spring of 1994. A vertical 
viewing angle of 80, which is twice the conventional angle, 
was achieved. 
  Specifically, the method developed this time uses the 
conventional TN display mode. The viewing angle characteristic 
was improved by nonuniformly orienting the liquid crystal 
molecules that had been uniformly oriented. Since fluctuations 
in the electro-optical characteristics that arise by the 
nonuniform orientation of liquid crystal molecules are visually 
averaged in one pixel, the viewing angle characteristic can be 
improved. By designing this kind of nonuniform liquid crystal 
molecule orientation, a wide viewing angle characteristic is 
obtained. 
  In the actual process, the coating process for a 
conventional 
oriented film is used and only the material preparation for the 
preceding and following processes and the process conditions are 
changed. In this method, an oriented film with a nonuniform 
orientation direction is fabricated and the orientation of the 
liquid crystal molecules are nonuniform. There is no additional 
processing like exposure and the rubbing process is performed 
once. Since the wait process which is the source of impurities 
is not needed, the increase in production cost is small and the 
reliability does not decrease. Moreover, since existing 
production facilities can be used with almost no changes and the 
process is slightly changed, the effect is small on the 
production process that has been mastered. 
  The display performance obtained by this process does not 
deteriorate the basic electro-optical characteristics compared 
to previous products, but only the viewing angle characteristics 
can be improved (Fig. 4, Table 2). In addition, the design 
specifications for the module power consumption and driving 
voltage are not affected. The data in Table 2 are examples of 
the TFT panel characteristics used in this method. By changing 
the orientation design of the liquid crystal, a viewing angle 
characteristic suited to the use can be obtained.

  Technology for wider viewing angles is basically considered 
to be technology that must be installed in all TFT panels. This 
technology does not expand the full-scale process, use special 
materials, lower quality, or lower reliability. A wide viewing 
angle technology is desired in the basic specification that 
doesn't require a major revision of existing lines constructed 
with substantial investments. Of the various proposed methods 
that are advancing development towards realization, which will 
be the one to take the lead depends on future research and 
development. Currently, this method has advantages over other 
methods. 
<H3>  Surface Reflectance Lowered to 1/10 by AR Processing, Making 
Outdoor Use of TFT Panels Possible </H3>
<H3>  Hideki Yakushigawa, Sharp Liquid Crystal Division, TFT 
Development Center </H3>
  By lowering the reflectance and increasing the luminance of 
TFT color LCD panels, their visibility outdoors will improve 
markedly. They can be used outdoors even without a hood. The 
liquid crystal ViewCam would probably never have been born 
without this technology. 
  In a conventional TFT color LCD, incident light is reflected 
at the interface between the front protective layer and the air 
layer and at the surface of the polarizer (Fig. 5). In terms of 
the transmittance of the polarizer, light that reaches the glass 
on the color filter side becomes about 44% of all the 
incident 
light on the panel. Since the reflectance is about 30% 
because 
of the black matrix, the reflected light is again returned to 
the display's surface. The total amount of reflected light that 
reaches the display's surface that included the light reflected 
at each interface reaches 23.3% of the incident light. 



  The characteristics of low reflectance panel (Fig. 6) 
developed here are lower reflectance of the black matrix and a 
polarizer processed with low reflectance coating, and the 
elimination of the air layer interface where reflectance takes 
place by removing the front protective layer. 



  The low reflectance coating is called antireflective (AR) 
processing. The principle used is reflected light is absorbed by 
interference of the light in multiple layers of film. The 
antireflective process is widely used in panels intended for OA 
to prevent reflections. The antireflective process simply 
scatters the incident light and reduces reflection by directly 
decreasing the reflection of the illumination and sunlight. 
  By using these antireflective processing in the liquid 
crystal ViewCam, the reflectance of the whole display was 
reduced to 2.6%. The current reflectance which is close 
to 10% 
made using TFT LCDs outdoors possible. However, this is 
considered to be unsatisfactory with the reflections of direct 
sunlight on clear days. The goal is reflectance below 1%. 
<H3>  300% Productivity Achieved in Term 2 Line with Larger 
Substrates and Equipment with Improved Processing Performance </H3>
<H5>  Yoshiaki Kobayashi, Toshiba LCD Technology Division </H5>
  Productivity in term 2 mass production line for TFT color 
LCDs improved 300% over the term 1 line (Fig. 7). 



  There were a number of indications of the many problems 
found 
in the term 1 line. The TFT array process in particular is a 
process that created one million transistors in the 10-inch LCD 
panel and that process equipment is significantly inferior to 
LSI (Table 3).

|Equipment in the term 1 line has problems with yield, productivity, energy  | 
|consumption, and space. Growing equipment, especially, had to be drasticall-| 
|y improved. Through joint development with the equipment manufacturers, the | 
|small-scale wafer equipment for the term 2 line achieved resource conservat-| 
|ion, energy savings, and space savings.                                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 


<H5>  Productivity in term 2 line increased 300% </H5>
  Along with expanding the market for TFT color LCDs, 
positioning the term 2 line can be viewed as the production line 
on which hangs the survival of each company. By pursuing 
performance and costs in color CRTs that already exist, the 
market for TFT color LCDs will be more certain. 
  The construction of a line with 300% improved 
productivity 
was the aim of the term 2 line. First, the productivity index 
per equipment investment increased 300% in the array 
process 
that commanded a large investment (Fig. 8). Next, in the cell 
process that advances the development of the line, the 
productivity index per hour increased 300%. In module 
processes 
requiring many workers, the productivity index per worker 
increased 300%. 



  Here, the productivity index represents the product of the 
number of panel bevels per mother glass substrate, the number of 
glass substrates processed per hour, the operating rate, and the 
yield. This equals the product of the number of processed panels 
per hour and the yield. 
<H5>  Making larger glass substrates and saving space </H5>
  The specific measure to improve to 300% began by 
first 
increasing the size of the glass substrate that can double the 
number of bevels from 2 bevels in the conventional 9.4-inch to 4 
bevels. Second, the equipment for growing film represented by 
CVD equipment and sputter equipment is replaced by more compact 
wafer equipment with improved operating rates, more stable 
performance, particle suppression, improved maintenance, and 
decreased running costs. The result enabled resource 
conservation, energy savings, and space savings. 
  Third, the focus of the lithography process is the 
importance 
of improving the transport method and the line duct with 
revamped processing. Fourth, various inline inspection devices, 
such as optical pattern inspection devices and dust monitors, 
were developed and introduced. These are essential tools for the 
process to have auto-termination. 
  Fifth, CIM that includes monitoring the process conditions 
and lot tracking is active and the yield was improved. While the 
equipment still has a low degree of completion, it is crucial to 
suppress fluctuations in the process conditions. Sixth, in 
expanding the types of manufactured products, automation of the 
cell and module processes to improve productivity is critical. 
In order to handle a variety of products in the module process, 
in particular, equipment that takes plan changes into 
consideration was developed. 
<H5>  Larger substrates in the term 3 line </H5>
  The 500% improvement in productivity, which is 
target for 
the term 3 line will be achieved by (a) increasing the substrate 
size from the 2 bevels of the 9.4-inch panel to 6 bevels, (b) 
improving the throughput by increasing the tact time and 
improving equipment performance like improved yield, and (c) 
decreasing the number of process steps with the intent of 
decreasing the total investment. Specifically, the first result 
of (a) is over 300% productivity, and (b) and (c) each 
increase 
productivity by 130%, for a total improvement in 
productivity 
of 500%. To decrease the total production cost, the costs 
of 
components and materials will also decrease. 
  In the development of equipment for the term 2 line, the 
technology development for the term 3 line and the specific 
investigations have begun. The main points are (1) increasing 
productivity by using large-scale substrates, (2) decreasing 
initial investments and running costs by effectively using clean 
room, (3) decreasing the power, indirect materials, and chemical 
expenses, (4) decreasing the number of process steps and 
integrating the processes, (5) introducing low cost processes 
and decreasing equipment prices, (6) improving equipment 
reliability and maintaining a high operating rate, (7) overall 
development of CIM and AGV, and (8) application to a large 
variety of cell and module processes. 
  In the term 2 line, a 360x465 mm[.sup]2[/] glass substrate 
that has a 9.4-inch panel with 4 bevels was selected. The 
substrate size will be made larger in the term 3 line depending 
on which panel size is optimum. 
  After developing equipment using the 360x465 mm[.sup]2[/] 
for the term 2 line, the substrate size in the term 3 line will 
be determined based on when the equipment manufacturer can 
develop equipment for the substrate size. The problem is how 
will the panel manufacturers standardize the next term's 
substrate size. Although one candidate is 
500x600mm[.sup]2[/], recently, the change will probably be to 
360x465 mm[.sup]2[/], the size used in term 2. 
<H5>  Part 3. Parts and Materials Technologies </H5>
<H3>  Successive Technologies Like Unpolished Glass Target 
&yen;50,000 Panels </H3>
<H5>  Solving the problem of standardizing various specifications </H5>
<H5>  Katsuhiro Nozaki </H5>

  The prices of components and materials for TFT color panels, 
that were hard to bring down from 1991 to 1993, have started to 
move towards the goal of &yen;50,000 in 1995. Added to the 
effect of mass production by expanding the market, large price 
decreases can be expected by introducing new technology. The 
glass substrate is not subjected to polishing or annealing, for 
a target cost decrease of 40%. The color filter also 
introduces 
a printing process and electrodeposition to move towards a 
40% 
cost decrease and a productivity improvement. Now, one backlight 
with a brighter lamp improved the transmittance of the unit. 
Advances are being made in the direction of cutting &yen;2,000 
during 1994. On the other hand, the trail of high additional 
costs was discovered, for instance, the nonreflecting polarizer. 
  The prices of components and materials used to build the 
second generation TFT color LCD panels are moving the panel 
price to &yen;50,000 for 10-inch models in 1995 (Fig. 1). 
Starting in 1994, panel manufacturers will charge headlong into 
full-scale production. Parts manufacturers who are confident of 
an expanding market will finally begin to decrease costs. 



  However, &yen;50,000 cannot be reached only by the effect of 
mass production. New technologies must be developed in each 
field that will make price cuts possible. Many prototype 
components and materials introduced by new technologies in 1993 
will be incorporated into products during 1994. 
<H5>  Glass substrates that further no polishing </H5>
  First, the prices of glass substrates will start to move. 
The 
direction is towards shortening the process by eliminating 
polishing the glass in order to lower prices and to increase the 
melting and molding yield. While each company adopts both, the 
established targets are a price of &yen;3,000 for 10-inch models 
in 1992 and reach half that price, &yen;1,500, in 1994 and 1995. 
  Corning, Inc., the largest manufacturer, and NH Technoglass 
have put effort into eliminating polishing. At the beginning of 
1993, Corning already began to apply this technique to mass 
production. By improving the melting and molding processes, 
flat, clean surfaces were obtained immediately after molding. 
Koya Iwai, business and planning manager at Corning Japan 
believes the process that eliminated the annealing process will 
be applied to mass production at the end of 1994. Overall, costs 
can be decreased 40%. At the earliest, NH Technoglass 
will also 
use unpolished glass in mass production in the spring of 1994. 
  Takao Sakamoto, executive director of technology at NEC 
Glass, states that NEC Glass effectively decreased costs by 
improving glass melting and molding yield. The yield that was 
usually less than 50% will be increased to about 60 to 
70%. 
Therefore, a multihead furnace for melting and molding was 
developed. Since the large furnace can handle all models in 
contrast to the small furnace that differs with each 
conventional model, the contact area with the furnace wall 
becomes small and there are few defects. 
  Activity has begun to introduce a printing method (see p. 
85) 
and electrodeposition. The goal is to decrease production costs 
by 40%. Masatake Nagao, executive director of Dai Nippon 
Printing, would like to see the current cost of &yen;20,000 for 
a 10-inch model fall to &yen;7,000 sometime in 1995 or 1996. The 
application to mass production will proceed in 1994. According 
to the business division of Toppan Printing Electronics, another 
direction is towards decreasing the costs in the pigment 
dispersion process. The cost of materials and the quantity used 
will decrease. Also, by cleaning, the yield will be increased 
from 60% to 80%; this will be 10% of the 
panel's price in 
1995. 
<H5>  Backlight unit converts to one light </H5>
  The plan is to lower the &yen;3,000 price of the 10-inch 
model in the backlight unit to below &yen;2,000 sometime in 
1994. The whole unit will convert to one light. The effect of 
increasing the unit's transmittance and the lamp's luminance 
will be significant. Masahiro Tomatsu, deputy manager of 
technology at Fujitsu Kasei, states a 30% decrease in 
cost is 
possible by using one light. 
  The mainstream of light conducting planes is moving towards 
the molding process. This is already beginning to be applied to 
mass-produced products for small 4-inch panels. Koichi Matsui, 
deputy director at Meitaku Systems, states that 10-inch molded 
products will be rushed to market during 1994. However, because 
production efficiency is low, by standardizing the size and 
shape, according to Hiroshi Kikuchi, manager of the Backlight 
Department at Empress Optonics, the lot is collected and there 
is an effect on large-scale mass production. There is also a 
manufacturer who will eliminate the light conducting plate (see 
p. 86). 
  The polarizer which affects the transmittance of the whole 
panel is being increased in price by efforts to lower its 
reflectance (see p. 87). Since there is a 3- to 10-fold jump in 
unit cost, lower costs will be introduced into the coating 
process. 
<H3>  Reducing the Average Cost Targeting a 40% Production 
Cost 
Reduction by Introducing a Printing Process </H3>
<H3>  Takuya Hamaguchi, Micro Products Division, Dai Nippon 
Printing </H3>

  The goal is to reduce production costs by 40% by 
changing 
the manufacturing process for color filters to a printing method. 
  The characteristics and costs of the currently popular 
pigment dispersion method were compared to the printing method 
(Table 1). Although the printing method is inferior in terms of 
quality and precision than the pigment dispersion method, when 
productivity is considered, the possibility of lowering costs is 
highest. The currently popular offset method is made practical 
by planographic printing and engraved printing (Fig. 2).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|The pigment dispersion method which is currently popular as the color filt-| 
|er manufacturing method was compared in terms of features and cost. The pr-| 
|inting method is still worse than the pigment dispersion method in term of | 
|quality, but it possesses many advantages on the production side.          | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 





  In terms of precision, although the printing method can have 
a resolution of 15 to 30m patterns, problems remain in 
dimensional stability and linearity of patterns in each 
printing. If the line width is about 100m, precision below 
8% can be guaranteed. In addition, since a rubber blanket 
cylinder is introduced in offset printing, the transfer pattern 
expands and contracts. Because the pitch accuracy is changed 
from several tens of micrometers per 400mm. However, the 
application to fine patterns is still difficult. 
  A remaining problem is the cross-sectional shapes of striped 
patterns become semicylindrical. Therefore, after RGB printing, 
the processes of flattening with a roll, polishing, and applying 
an overcoat layer are performed. From the perspective of 
quality, exterior defects like bumps, unevenness, pin holes are 
problems. Since these originate in the printing process, 
materials, and operating precision of the printing machinery, 
they are handled by improving precision. 
<H5>  Dealing with lower material costs and standardization </H5>
  To lower costs, first, the number of process are increased 
to 
flatten the surface shape. However, this leads to concern about 
cost increases and lower yields. So the costs for leveling and 
processing of the ink material are lowered. Secondly, overall 
there are improvements in the precision of processes, materials, 
and printing machines with respect to defects that influence the 
yield. 
  Thirdly, an advance towards the standardization of glass 
plate sizes and characteristics is required. The substrate size 
in the term 2 line is moving in the direction of unification. 
However, the light distribution characteristics and film will 
differ with each manufacturer. Standardization by the main panel 
manufacturers are desired. Fourth, decreasing the cost of the 
black matrix will become important. Plans must be put into place 
to decrease the cost of the whole filter by combining with a low 
cost black matrix. 
<H3>  Decisive Development of a Thin, Lightweight, Low Cost 
Backlight with No Light Conductor </H3>
<H5>  Ken Kojima, SBC Business Division, Chatani Industries </H5>
  Because of the stringent demands for decreasing power, 
lowering costs, and making thinner and lighter TFT color LCD 
panels, the development of new backlight units is demanded. As a 
result, by developing a structure that eliminates the light 
conductor, the aim is to reduce costs by simplifying the 
structure and making it thinner and lighter. At the same time, 
the manufacturing process can be shortened since printing the 
dot pattern on the light conductor will be eliminated. 
  A backlight unit without the light conductor consists of a 
reflector that has a diffused reflector and a cold-cathode tube 
on the unit's side (Fig. 3). Light emitted from the cold-cathode 
tube is diffusely reflected in the air layer by the diffused 
reflective layer. Special ink which is uneven and has a high 
density is used by the embossing process on the inside surface 
of the reflector to form a diffuse reflective layer. 



  In the region near the cold-cathode tube, the luminance of 
the backlight surface by direct illumination is brighter than in 
other parts. This lessens the uniformity of the illumination on 
the surface and causes bright lines to appear. Therefore, a 
semi-transparent or nontransparent reflector is provided near 
the cold-cathode tube. 
  Light dispersed by the diffused reflective layer on the 
bottom is converged by a special converging lens on the top. The 
converging lens consists of one or two lenses. The lens used in 
the prototype has less directionality than conventional prisms, 
lenses, or films. Rather, it has light convergence and light 
diffusion close to those of current diffusers. 
  Together with making a thinner and lighter weight backlight 
unit that does not contain a conductor, there can be little 
attenuation of light by the light conductor. About one-tenth of 
light output by the cold-cathode tube can be obtained as the 
surface luminance of the backlight unit. This backlight unit is 
one-third the weight of a conventional unit and two-thirds its 
thickness. The luminance can be increased 20 to 40% and 
power 
consumption can be suppressed to a low 10 to 20% (Table 
2).

|When there is no light conductor, not only is the unit thinner and lighte-|

|he weight is one-third; the thickness, two-thirds; and the luminance is 20|

  When luminance is the same as current levels, power 
consumption can be decreased to below 1.5W in the TFT panel and 
2.5W in the STN panel. At this time, the transmittance of the 
TFT panel was assumed to be 6% and the transmittance of 
the STN 
panel to be 3%. The plan is to implement this kind of 
backlight 
unit without a conductor in the fall of 1994.

Vapor-Deposited Multi Coat </H3>

  By adding antireflective to the polarizer, the loss of the 
amount of light transmitted is decreased and scattering of the 
reflected light by external light reflection is prevented. In a 
typical glass plate and polarizer, about 4% surface 
reflection 
arises for each light that passes through the air interface. 
When external light multiplied by 4% of the amount of 
light is 
added to the image light, the visibility of the image is 
markedly decreased. The surface reflectance required for outdoor 
use will become one standard of less then 0.4% which 
corresponds to 1/10 the reflectance of a normal polarizer and 
the glass plate (Fig. 4). 



  Methods to grow the antireflective layer are roughly 
classified into vapor-deposited multi coats and applied coats. 
By performing vapor deposition in a vacuum for the 
vapor-deposited multi coating, materials that have different 
refractive indices are grown in layers on the film's surface. 
This method can suppress the lowest surface reflectance. 
  Established technology for molded products, primarily 
optical 
products, have problems with low productivity and high costs in 
batch processing. Inorganic compounds like SiO[.sup]2[/], 
TiO[.sup]2[/], or ZrO[.sub]2[/] with various refractive 
indices are each 0.1 to 0.2m thick which corresponds to 1/4 
the wavelength of visible light. 
  Applied coating coats a material with a low refractive index 
onto a polarizer and a supporting film. This technique suits the 
continuous roll film processing and is being adopted in mass 
production. Additionally, its cost is below that of the vapor 
deposition. On the other hand, the properties of surface 
reflectance and hardness are usually somewhat worse than the 
vapor deposition. Inorganic and organic fluoride compounds are 
used in the materials. 
  The two processes of indirect and direct methods are being 
developed as film growing processing. In the first process of 
indirect methods, an antireflective process treats a transparent 
hard coat support film. This forms the antireflective polarizer 
that is affixed to the polarizer with an adhesive. The direct 
method is an antireflective coating that is directly applied to 
the surface of the hard coat polarizer. In addition to a thinner 
shape, a shorter process is also advantageous in terms of cost. 
  Fingerprints on the surface are a problem in the 
antireflective process (Table 3). By including water repellant 
processing in the vapor deposition and the dipping process on 
the film's external side, an anti-soiling effect is produced. 
Currently, however, the level where absolutely no fingerprints 
remain has not been reached.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The 1993 White Paper on nuclear energy has been compiled. 
The 
unique features of this year's White Paper is that it focuses on 
``nuclear fuel recycling'' --the reuse of plutonium, etc., 
analyzes the situation in Japan and abroad, and expresses more 
clearly than before the significance of Japan's adoption of 
nuclear fuel recycling. Here, we will introduce trends in 
nuclear fuel recycling, using the White Paper as a guide. 
  This year's White Paper, as last year's, is composed of 
three 
sections: ``General Discussion,'' which summarizes the current 
status and future issues in the development and use of nuclear 
energy; ``Discussion of Individual Issues,'' which presents the 
state of progress made during the year on individual issues, and 
``Materials.'' The opening of the general discussion section 
addresses the internal and international status of nuclear fuel 
recycling and ``work toward revision of the long-term plan for 
development and use of nuclear energy.'' 
  In this White Paper, a new status was given to 
``international contribution to development of the future'' in 
the context of Japan's promotion of nuclear fuel recycling. It 
expresses the perception that nuclear fuel recycling is 
``technological energy made from the application of science and 
technology, and is the international obligation of Japan, a 
large consumer of energy that does not have its own energy 
resources and a country with advanced technological capability 
in the field of nuclear energy.'' 
  This is more explicit than last year's White Paper, which 
cites ``carrying out the role of a country that is a global 
driving force for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.'' This 
probably was the outcome of the judgement that in view of 
concerns about global nuclear proliferation and the slowdown of 
R&amp;D on nuclear fuel recycling in Germany and other advanced 
nuclear energy countries, it is necessary to re-clarify the 
significance of nuclear fuel recycling. 
  The Japan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) is working on 
revising the long-term plan for development and use of nuclear 
energy with a view toward the 21st Century, and the majority 
opinion of the commission is that emphasis should be given to 
nuclear fuel recycling from the position of Japan's 
international contribution. Along with this, someone involved 
with the JAEC indicated that ``promoting recycling from the 
viewpoint of waste processing'' may be stated as a reason for 
promoting nuclear fuel recycling. 
  What nuclear power proponents have in mind is not just 
plutonium use but also the promotion of ``actinide recycling,'' 
which entails using fast reactors to burn transuranic elements 
(TRU) that are in high-level radioactive waste (HLW). It may be 
possible to drastically reduce the burden of waste control 
through annihilation disposal of long-lived TRU that require 
long-term control in 10,000-year increments. 
  The mainstream of fast reactor research in the United States 
and France has shifted to actinide recycling, and the Power 
Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation has entered 
into full-scale research cooperation with each country. Although 
the white paper did not touch upon this matter, it is highly 
possible that the long-term plan will in some form incorporate a 
partial review of the idea of plutonium breeding. 
  In this White Paper, a distinction is made between the 
``nuclear fuel cycle,'' as the nuclear fuel flow that begins 
with uranium exploration and enrichment, and ``nuclear fuel 
recycling,'' as the reuse of fuel. Quite a few people think that 
``recycling'' is starting to be emphasized because it will be 
well-received by the public in these days of heightened interest 
in environmental problems.

focus on nuclear fuel recycling] 
  [Text] This year's White Paper states, with respect to an 
international environment conducive to promoting nuclear fuel 
recycling, that ``international circumstances concerning 
plutonium, from the viewpoint of non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, has changed greatly and is quite harsh,'' thus 
expressing a new sense of crisis. Concerned that tremors in the 
nuclear non-proliferation system will be an obstacle to the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy, the white paper stresses that 
Japan should take the lead in strengthening that system. 
  The White Paper raises issues such as (1) North Korea's 
declared intention to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), (2) suspicions about Iraq's 
development of nuclear weapons, and (3) Ukraine's possession of 
strategic nuclear weapons; and it warns that ``these cannot help 
but have a restraining effect on peaceful use of nuclear energy, 
and are reasons for serious concern.'' 
  The White Paper also expresses concern by stating that, as 
nuclear disarmament in the United States and the former Soviet 
Union advances, ``the problems of accumulation, storage, use and 
disposal of plutonium and other nuclear materials from 
dismantled nuclear weapons are expected to grow more serious.'' 
The White Paper cites an estimate of about 125 tons of plutonium 
extracted from the dismantling of Russian nuclear weapons alone. 
  Based on this international situation, the White Paper 
states 
that ``It is crucial to get the full understanding of all 
countries concerned about the use of plutonium,'' thereby 
advocating full openness of information about Japan's plutonium 
use policy. It also stresses that ``It is important for Japan to 
contribute actively to strengthening the global nuclear 
non-proliferation system.'' 
  As a way of strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation 
system, Japan is doing a full-scale study of the creation of a 
framework for international control of plutonium. Science and 
Technology Agency (STA) Director General Eda proposed the 
concept of international control at the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) general session at the end of September. 
The concept basically called for each country to reveal the 
status of planning and use of plutonium for commercial purposes 
and the status of the plutonium from the dismantling of nuclear 
weapons. and for verification of this information by an 
international organization. 
  Moreover, in October, Japan and Russia signed an agreement 
concerning assistance to Russia in the fields of storage and 
peaceful use of nuclear materials created from the dismantling 
of nuclear weapons. Preparations are underway for the 
establishment of an ``international science and technology 
center'' by Japan, the United States, the European Community and 
Russia aimed at preventing a brain drain of scientists and 
technicians from Russia. 
  The White Paper states that the estimated amount of the 
world's plutonium as of 1990, was about 257 tons for military 
use and about 654 tons for civilian use. Of the plutonium for 
civilian use, about 532 tons is in spent nuclear fuel, about 72 
tons has been separated and stored, and the rest exists in the 
nuclear fuel cycle. As of June 1993, Japan had about 1.6 tons of 
crude plutonium.

focus on nuclear fuel recycling] 
  [Text] The trend of R&amp;D policies of foreign countries 
is a 
matter of concern in relation to Japan's work on development of 
nuclear fuel recycling. This year's White Paper analyzes in 
greater detail than in normal years the trends in other 
countries, and acknowledges that there are adverse factors 
affecting development all over the world, stating that ``In some 
countries, nuclear fuel recycling activities are tending to slow 
down due to loose supply and demand of uranium or fiscal 
circumstances.'' 
  In the midst of this, Japan is counting on France to be the 
leader in development of nuclear fuel recycling. The French 
demonstration fast breeder reactor (FBR) ``Super Phoenix'' 
ceased operation in 1990 because of problems, but in September 
1993, the public hearing committee, which has been studying the 
safety or the reactor, issued a report that supported 
recommencing operation with the proviso that new countermeasures 
be taken to prevent the danger of natrium fires. 
  Therefore, procedures have begun to resume operation around 
next summer. The emphasis of research is expected to shift from 
plutonium breeding to plutonium and TRU annihilation disposal, 
and this is likely to affect Japan's FBR development. 
  R&amp;D in Great Britain and Germany, influential 
proponents of 
nuclear fuel recycling, has slowed down markedly. In December 
1992, Great Britain decided to terminate operation of the 
``PFR'' prototype FBR in 1994 for economic reasons. Germany cut 
short its ``SNR-300'' prototype FBR project just before it 
became operational for political reasons. 
  The White Paper's analysis of these events was that ``These 
countries already have accumulated the results of developing FBR 
technology and are holding back on further investment of 
funding.'' It seems to want to say that there still is a gap 
between Japan and Europe in FBR technology and continuing to 
pursue FBR development would by no means put Japan far ahead of 
Europe. 
  In Great Britain, the Thorpe Reprocessing Plant, which has 
been contracted by Japanese electric power companies to 
reprocess spent fuel, still is unable to begin operation because 
of opposition by the environmental protection group Greenpeace. 
In Germany as well, the Siemens uranium-plutonium mixed oxide 
(MOX) fuel plant cannot operate because of political reasons. 
  On the other hand, although the United States abandoned 
commercial reprocessing and other forms of nuclear fuel 
recycling when the Carter Administration strengthened the U.S. 
non-proliferation policy in the 1970s, it has continued 
technological development of ``ALMR,'' a fast reactor that uses 
metallic fuel. 
  However, the U.S. non-proliferation policy statement that 
was 
issued in September clearly states that ``The United States will 
not promote civilian use of plutonium.'' The White Paper also 
concludes that the United States is ``negative about FBRs, 
judging from its budgetary measures.''

<F P=106> [Part 4 of 4-part article on Nuclear Power White Paper's </F>
focus on nuclear fuel recycling] 
  [Text] One of the unique features of this year's White 
Paper is that it emphasizes openness of information in the 
nuclear energy sector. With regard to information control, while 
stating that ``cautious handling is needed'' from the viewpoint 
of protection of nuclear materials, it advocates ``as much 
openness as possible,'' and maintains that ``excessive 
non-disclosure in the name of protecting information that is 
sensitive for reasons of protection of nuclear materials, 
nuclear non-proliferation, and protection of property rights 
should be avoided.'' 
  The immediate reason why the White Paper makes a big issue 
of 
information disclosure is because United Socialist Democratic 
Party representative Satsuki Eda, who was appointed STA director 
general with the changeover in government, favors openness of 
information. The working level white paper draft did not cite 
openness of information in great detail, but on instructions 
from the director general, phrasing was changed substantially, 
such as by the addition of an independent paragraph on this 
issue. 
  A great debate arose over openness of information in the 
nuclear energy field because the authorities declared that most 
information relating to the transporting of plutonium from 
France by the transport vessel Akatsuki-Maru, which took place 
from November 1992 to January 1993, was secret due to the need 
to protect nuclear materials. 
  Moreover, in connection with the safety of nuclear fuel 
recycling facilities, anti-nuclear groups are vociferous about 
openness of design information. Although Director General Eda 
says, ``I have instructed working level authorities to study 
what additional information can be disclosed,'' the propensity 
to take a wary attitude about openness of information is 
deep-rooted at the facilities themselves, and there are many 
uncertainties about what the content of that additional 
information will be. 
  With progress in the development of nuclear fuel recycling, 
the need to provide information to other countries also will 
increase. At the time of the plutonium transport by the 
Akatsuki-Maru, there was marked increase in international 
interest about Japan's plutonium use policy as well. The White 
Paper states that ``Provision of information internationally is 
extremely important'' in order to gain international 
understanding and cooperation for Japan's policies. 
  STA leaders stress that ``Basically, the United States is 
uncomfortable with the idea of commercial use of plutonium, and 
Japan needs to send messages constantly about its nuclear 
non-proliferation efforts.'' The idea of creating a new forum 
for nuclear energy cooperation with Asian countries and to seek 
their understanding for Japan's policies also is being studied. 
  There is criticism that the work of reviewing the long-term 
plan for development and use of nuclear energy, which is in 
full-swing, is being carried out mostly through studies by 
nuclear experts and is not necessarily an open debate. These are 
individual arguments about what information should be disclosed, 
and this white paper may be the beginning of that process.

  [Text] Prospects now are good that the ``international 
science and technology (S&amp;T) center'', a joint project 
advanced 
by Japan, the United States, the European Community (EC) and 
Russia to prevent the outflow of nuclear related technology from 
the former Soviet Union, will be established in Moscow within 
the year. This is due to the fact that the Russian government is 
taking steps that can take the place of ratification by the 
Russian parliament of the agreement concerning establishment of 
the center, which has been delayed by a conflict between the 
reformist and conservative factions. These steps will be 
completed in November and the agreement is expected to become 
effective 1 month after that. Once the center begins operation, 
it is expected to spur conversion of Russia from a military to 
civil state and contribute greatly to global security. Research 
themes for the center already are being studied by 
representatives of all the countries, and the center finally is 
about to be realized, 1 year and 8 months after it was 
conceptualized. The international S&amp;T center will be 
established 
with the goal of preventing the proliferation of nuclear related 
technology that would result if scientists and technicians that 
were involved in weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear, 
biological and chemical weapons and their delivery were to pour 
out to other countries because of the domestic economic and 
social chaos caused by the breakup of the former Soviet Union. 
These scientists and technicians will be given research projects 
and there will be joint research and technology and knowhow 
sharing. 
  The concept of the center was proposed by the United States, 
Germany and Russia in February 1992. Japan decided to 
participate in March of the same year. Germany's participation 
evolved into EC participation, and the center became a 
quadrilateral joint project. Also, in April, Japan announced 
that it would contribute $20 million over 2 years; the United 
States will contribute $25 million, the EC 20 million European 
currency units (ECU; equal to $24 million), and Russia will 
provide the facilities. In November, the four parties signed the 
agreement to establish the center; Japan and the United States 
ratified the agreement on the same day, and EC ratification came 
thereafter. 
  As for Japan, the Foreign Ministry, MITI and the Science and 
Technology Agency (STA) each has been allocated $3 million from 
the FY93 budget to support research at the center to convert 
nuclear related technology to power generation technology. Also, 
if the center is established, the Foreign Ministry's deputy

  [Text] The Nuclear Power Generation Technology 
Organization, a foundation, recently began three new projects: 
  (1) demonstration testing of fluid excitation vibration, 
which caused the rupture of steam generator heat transfer pipes 
in the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant of the Kansai Electric Power 
Company; 
  (2) research using a supercomputer to analyze nuclear power 
plant safety during accidents; 
  (3) installation of a full scope simulator to support safe 
operation of nuclear power plants in Russia. These will be 
carried out, along with continuation of projects such as 
earthquake-proofing reliability testing, with a budget of 
&yen;25.9 billion, a 14.6% increase from the previous 
fiscal 
year. 
  In the case of Kansai Electric's Mihama Number 2 power plant 
accident, the flow speed of the water-steam two-phase flow 
around the heat transfer pipe exceeded the critical velocity 
that excites flow strength elastic vibration, and that vibration 
caused fretting fatigue which ruptured the pipe. Due to this 
accident, it was proposed that methods for evaluating flow 
excitation vibration and hydrothermal behavior be upgraded 
through experiments. This research will be carried out as a 
4-year project starting this fiscal year as ``demonstration 
tests concerning steam generator flow excitation vibration.'' 
  The research will reveal the mechanism that creates flow 
excitation vibration in the steam generator under conditions 
(dimensions and heat flow) close to that of the actual 
equipment, and will upgrade evaluation methods to clearly show 
degree of reliability of the steam generator during operation. 
The project calls for designing and manufacturing the testing 
equipment by FY95, conducting tests for about a year from 
mid-FY95, and finishing up in FY96. 
  The ``testing to demonstrate reliability of accident 
escalation prevention functions using margin of safety'' will 
demonstrate, through simulation analysis, that there is an 
adequate safety margin in the safety functions of existing 
equipment even if accidents occur at nuclear power plants and 
that comprehensive application of these functions will ensure 
safety. These accidents are composite phenomena, in which 
various types of elements interact in a complex manner, and 
analysis of such composite phenomena requires upgrading of 
analytical technology to enable simultaneous consideration of 
complex elements. Computer technology will be applied to link up 
all the elements of the composite phenomena, provide a 
simulation, and do analysis of the composite phenomena that 
could only have been done through large-scale demonstration 
tests in the past. The project also will make it possible to 
confirm results visually; for example, the status of fuel will 
be displayed in color (showing temperature) and shapes so that 
anyone can visually comprehend its status. During this fiscal 
year, a super-high speed large-scale computer will be used for 
surveys of severe accident analysis codes that are needed to 
demonstrate safety margin, and specific development themes will 
be set for the next fiscal year and thereafter. 
  The content of ``nuclear power plant operational technology 
center maintenance project (aid to improve safe operation of 
Russian nuclear power plants)'' will provide cooperation on two 
points: 
  (1) a full scope simulator targeting the VVER-1000 type 
reactor will be built in the operational training center in 
Novovolonej [phonetic], Russia; 
  (2) the new full scope simulator will be used to improve 
educational programs concerning nuclear power plant operational 
safety.

  [Text] On 2 November, the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan 
(JAEC; chaired by Science and Technology Agency (STA) Director 
General Satsuki Eda) decided to change the existing policy of 
disposing of low level radioactive waste from nuclear power 
plants basically by burial underground or ocean dumping so that 
the latter, ocean dumping, will not be used in the future. This 
measure was taken out of consideration for the fact that ocean 
dumping of radioactive waste by Russia has rapidly strengthened 
sentiment for a total ban on ocean dumping. 
  The government has expressed the plan to vote in favor of a 
total ban on ocean dumping at a conference of London Treaty 
signatories, which will convene in London on 8 November, and the 
JAEC's decision confirms this. STA says that ``this will not 
affect Japan's nuclear energy policy immediately'' because Japan 
is not dumping in the ocean at this time. 
  The JAEC maintains that ocean dumping of low level 
radioactive nuclear waste has no special effect on public health 
according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
standards. However, judging from the Japanese and international 
reaction to ocean dumping by Russia, it believes that ``from a 
political and social viewpoint, it would be extremely difficult 
to carry out ocean dumping.'' It says that hereafter, 
``underground burial will be used,'' and it is seeking to expand 
those facilities.

  [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC) has completed the loading of internal core 
fuel assemblies (108 units) in the prototype fast breeder 
reactor (FBR) ``Monju'' (rated output 280,000 kilowatts), which 
started on 13 October, and it began evaluation tests on flow 
distribution in the core on 4 November. In these tests, 
instruments to measure flow will be installed in the reactor and 
the flow of natrium circulating among the fuel assemblies will 
be measured and evaluated. 
  To cool the ``Monju's'' core efficiently, the coolant 
natrium 
is circulated in response to the amount of heat generated by 
core fuel assemblies and blanket fuel assemblies, important 
components of the core. Evaluation testing will continue until 
around the beginning of February 1994.

  [Text] The Japan Atomic Power Company (JAPCO) and the U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) will conclude a contract for joint 
development of an electromagnetic pump for use in fast breeder 
reactors (FBRs). FBRs use molten natrium to extract heat from 
the reactor core. At present, this natrium is circulated by a 
mechanical pump that uses a propeller, but since an 
electromagnetic pump would not generate vibrations, it is 
expected to reduce the probability of breakdowns. The 
electromagnetic pump will be an important element technology for 
the commercial FBR that will follow the demonstration reactor. 
  Natrium is a metal, and in accordance with the Fleming rule, 
it will start to move when a magnetic field is created and 
electricity is passed. JAPCO and DOE will co-develop the 
electromagnetic pump based on this principle. Natrium is 
extremely reactive, and will cause serious accidents if it leaks 
out and comes into contact with moisture. Problems with natrium 
have been a weak point of FBRs in other countries as well. 
Breakdowns will be rare with the electromagnetic pump because 
there will be no mechanical drive system and vibrations will not 
occur. 
  The prototype FBR ``Monju,'' in which the Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) plans to achieve 
criticality in 1994, as well as FBRs under research in other 
countries use mechanical pumps with propellers to circulate 
natrium. Development of an electromagnetic pump will encourage 
the development of commercial FBRs. 
  FBRs operate the same as light water reactors (LWRs) used 
commercially in nuclear power plants that use heat created by 
nuclear fission to make steam, which turns turbines to generate 
electricity. They were called breeder reactors because they 
produce plutonium, which can be used as a nuclear fuel, at the 
same time as they produce heat. 
  While the LWR uses water to extract heat from the core, 
however, the FBR uses 580C molten natrium. If it used 
water, it would slow down neutron speed created by fission,and 
this would not be suitable for plutonium breeding. That is why 
the FBR uses natrium, which does not slow down neutrons.

  [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have 
agreed to cooperate in research on next-generation technology 
concerning the reuse of spent nuclear fuel. This is ``actinide 
recycling'' technology, the use of use fast breeder reactors to 
burn plutonium and radioactive waste that is extracted from 
spent fuel from nuclear power generation. Because the plutonium 
and waste can be burned together, the plutonium will be used in 
a form that is difficult to convert to military use. This also 
will reduce the amount of long-lived waste which is a disposal 
problem. The research cooperation is aimed at establishing 
nuclear fuel technology that is sensitive to non-proliferation 
of nuclear weapons and conservation of the environment. 
  U.S.-Japan cooperation concerning actinide recycling already 
was discussed during talks in Vienna between Science and 
Technology (STA) Director General Eda and U.S. Energy Secretary 
O'Leary in September. The decision to proceed was made at the 
end of October, when prospects looked good that about $37.3 
million would be budgeted by the U.S. Congress. PNC and DOE will 
conclude a cooperation agreement at the beginning of 1994. 
  Forms of cooperation being studied include the use of DOE 
research facilities by both U.S. and Japanese researchers and 
provision of test data using PNC's fast breeder reactors (FBRs) 
``Joyo'' and ``Monju.'' 
  PNC has become more convinced that in the current atmosphere 
of concerns about nuclear proliferation and a trend of excess 
supply of plutonium, it would not be realistic in the short term 
to pursue the development plan of extracting high-purity 
plutonium from spent fuel and increasing it in FBRs. That was 
why, only recently, it had decided independently on full-scale 
development of actinide recycling as a technology with high 
resistance to nuclear proliferation. 
  On the other hand, the United States stopped commercial 
reuse 
of spent fuel and development of FBRs after the Carter 
Administration strengthened the U.S. policy on nuclear 
non-proliferation in the latter half of the 1970s. Even after 
that, however, DOE promoted the project to develop an advanced 
liquid metal cooled reactor (ALMR), a type of fast reactor. 
Under the Clinton Administration, it was decided to continue an 
actinide recycling project in which spent fuel would be reused 
in the form of metallic fuel. 
  France, the world leader in FBR development, has decided to 
change its FBR research policy goal from plutonium breeding to 
actinide burning. PNC already has strengthened research 
cooperation in this field with France's Atomic Energy Agency. 
The PNC-DOE agreement has provided a clear picture of 
cooperation among Japan, the United States and France on using 
fast reactors for actinide recycling. 
<H3>  Editorial Comment: Makes Conversion to Weapons Difficult and 
Lightens U.S. Disposal Burden </H3>
  Actinides is the general name for 14 elements from thorium, 
with an atomic number of 90, to lawrencium, with an atomic 
number of 103. Sometimes actinium, with an atomic number of 89, 
is included. All are radioactive elements, and long-lived 
transuranic elements (TRU) that are created by nuclear fission 
reaction in a nuclear reactor, such as neptunium, plutonium and 
americium, are typical of actinides. 
  The nuclear fuel cycle -- the reprocessing and reuse of 
spent 
fuel from nuclear power generation -- so far has focused on 
plutonium and unburned uranium, and high-purity plutonium is 
being extracted at reprocessing plants. In contrast, actinide 
recycling is a new method in which various types of TRU that 
were unburned and were treated as waste would be burned along 
with plutonium. 
  The United States is disposing of spent fuel directly 
without 
reprocessing, but it is facing the problem of inadequate storage 
facilities. DOE is stressing that if actinide recycling can 
reduce the amount of waste with a half-life calculated in 
increments of tens of thousands of years, only waste with a 
half-life in increments of several hundred years will need to be 
controlled, thus lightening the burden of disposal. 
  PNC, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that actinide 
recycling will extract plutonium along with ``impurities'' and 
make it difficult to convert the plutonium to use in nuclear 
weapons, and that, moreover, it will make annihilation disposal 
of excess plutonium possible. In these days of heightened 
opposition to plutonium breeding, PNC sees actinide recycling as 
``the ultimate nuclear fuel cycle technology'' that cuts the tie 
to military technology and that will have international appeal.

  [Text] During this fiscal year, development of the 
technology for the use of wire saws in decommissioning, which is 
being advanced by the Nuclear Facility Decommissioning Research 
Association under consignment by the Science and Technology 
Agency, will enter the stage of test manufacturing of equipment 
and testing of performance on large-scale specimens. 
  Development of the technology started in the previous fiscal 
year, and so far, basic cutting tests using a 1 square meter 
(sqm) concrete specimen were carried out and they confirmed good 
cutting capability. During this fiscal year, additional 
performance tests using a 2 sqm specimen will be carried out and 
test manufacturing of a cutting system will begin. 
  The performance tests are scheduled to be advanced by using 
increasingly larger specimens. The final technical goal is doing 
a good job of cutting a 5 sqm concrete piece. 


  The blade of the wire saw is a wire made of pressed diamond 
powder. It is rotated for cutting by a drive mechanism. It is 
said to be useful for cutting thick concrete structural 
material, for example, and is being used in the construction 
industry. 
  In the cutting process, a hole is drilled in the material to 
be cut and the wire is passed through it. Two cutting methods 
are being considered; one in which the wire is connected to the 
drive mechanism through a guide pulley, and cutting is done by 
pulling the wire back, and the other is in which guide pulleys 
are installed at both ends and cutting is done by pushing the 
wire through the material. 
  Although there are limits to the wire's capability, in 
principle, it can deal flexibly with the target object's 
thickness as long as the wire length is extended and it has the 
merit of little secondary waste material. 
  To apply this to nuclear energy related facilities, the 
cutting system, in addition to the basic composition of wire saw 
and drive mechanism, must be able to deal with radioactive 
materials, so the external side of the cutting equipment has to 
be shielded, there must be equipment to cool the wire during 
cutting, and a device to collect cuttings must be provided. 
  The type of coolant used is related to the amount of 
secondary waste generation, and is being studied as a major 
problem. Water or gas are being studied as possible wire 
coolants. 
  The plan is to continue to study such problems as well as 
remoting technology, and build an optimum system.

  [Text] The fast breeder reactor (FBR) development program 
experts' subcommittee is working on final compilation of future 
FBR development policy, and Subgroup Two (chaired by Hiroshi 
Murata, executive director of the Japan Atomic Energy Relations 
Organization) of the long-term plan experts' subcommittee, which 
has been deliberating on the fuel cycle, will meet on 29 
September 1993 to move quickly to wrap up the work of the 
subgroup by the end of the year. 
  Future work on the fuel cycle will be determined greatly by 
the demonstration FBR program. In the FBR experts' subcommittee, 
selection of type of the first demonstration reactor was 
narrowed down to the top entry type, and the feasibility of the 
technology has been studied mainly by this subcommittee's basic 
survey subgroup. Results of this study are to be reported at the 
FBR subcommittee on 22 September. If work on the draft of the 
subcommittee's interim wrap-up has advanced sufficiently, a 
draft report of the interim wrap-up may be presented as well. 
  With regard to the demonstration FBR program, the current 
long-term plan for development and use of nuclear energy says 
that construction will begin in the latter half of the 1990s, 
but no concrete policy has been set. Finalization of the report 
will depend on the degree of specificity of the plans presented 
by the electric power companies, who will be the main entities 
involved in the building and operation of the demonstration FBR. 
Although the construction date will become clear in the course 
of coordination of the plans, it appears that the intention is 
to leave construction cost as an issue for future deliberation. 
As for R&amp;D, prospects are good that the roles of the 
government 
and the private sector, including technological development at 
the large-scale research facility in the Oarai Engineering 
Center of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC), will be decided. Subcommittee wrap-up is 
expected to be around October or November. 
  Paralleling this work by the FBR experts' subcommittee, 
Subgroup Two of the long-term plan experts' subcommittee also is 
hurrying to complete its work. Subgroup Two is to review the 
plutonium supply and demand balance that was released 2 years 
ago, based on the demonstration FBR development program 
presented by the FBR subcommittee, and already has presented a 
table of estimates at the August meeting of the subgroup. 
  According to that table of estimates, there will be a delay 
in commencement of operation of the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant 
if demonstration FBR development proceeds according to the 
current long-term plan for development and use of nuclear 
energy, but plutonium supply and demand will be balanced because 
of delays in construction of the ``Monju'' and the demonstration 
advanced thermal reactor (ATR). This will be reestimated in the 
future when operation of the demonstration FBR begins. 
Incidentally, the majority view is that the date of commencement 
of operation of the demonstration FBR will be somewhat later 
than given in the current long-term plan. The wrap-up of 
Subgroup Two is expected to be done within the year.

  [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC), which will carry out R&amp;D aimed at 
completing 
a future plutonium use technological system that will provide 
high resistance to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and work 
harmoniously with the environment, plans to begin a concept 
survey from next fiscal year in order to promote development of 
the ``recycling system experimental fast reactor (tentative 
name),'' which will be the core of R&amp;D on a system for 
recycling 
transuranic elements (TRU), including plutonium. 
  In Japan, which is promoting plutonium recycling as its 
policy, an issue for the future is to develop a system with high 
social acceptance by reducing the burden of radioactive waste 
processing and disposal and raising the degree of 
non-proliferation, and one effective method would be a plutonium 
and TRU recycling system. The advantage of making TRU into fuel 
is not only its effective use as a heat source, but also the 
fact that it will make it possible to avoid recovering highly 
concentrated plutonium in unmixed form, thus heightening 
resistance to proliferation of nuclear weapons. Also, combustion 
of TRU will reduce the accumulation of long half-life nuclides 
and simplify disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW). 
  According to PNC, the experimental reactor development 
program will confirm the possibility of establishing 
technologies for the following: 
  (1) system that applies the features of a fast reactor that 
can make quantitative adjustments, from breeding to consumption 
stages; 
  (2) system that is harmonious with the environment because 
it 
minimizes TRU combustion and the amount of generated waste; 
  (3) system that can be easily accepted by society, such as 
one that has safety features that are easy to understand; 
  (4) system that is high in nuclear non-proliferation, from 
fuel fabrication to reprocessing. 
  PNC intends to develop this through international 
cooperation, not just in Japan. 
  Toward this end, PNC wants to use the experimental reactor 
to 
carry out core performance tests, focusing on verification of 
core passive safety features, and make this into an experimental 
reactor with more advanced instrumentation for the core and 
other areas. Also, with a view toward practical use, 
revolutionary technology will be incorporated into the test 
facility for testing and demonstration. After core feature 
tests, the plan is to confirm the TRU recycling system as a 
whole by means of a TRU fuel core structure, with the goal of 
verifying consistent performance of the TRU recycling system. 
  To further the development of TRU annihilation, the 
development of nitride fuel and other new fuels and the 
development of fuel in preparation for the evolvement of the 
current experimental fast breeder reactor (``Joyo'') into a 
practical model, PNC is developing the MK-III project to 
heighten neutron flux, expand irradiation area and upgrade 
irradiation technology. This experimental reactor program is a 
continuation of that project. 
  The experimental reactor program timetable starts with a 
study of technology selection and appropriateness of experiment 
content in FY94. This will be followed by a survey of technology 
outlook and facility concept and a survey study of core 
concepts. The budget for FY94 will be about &yen;100 million. 
Research on conceptual design will start in FY95.

  [Text] On 1 October, the Hokkaido Electric Power Company 
began operating the ``nuclear power training center'' at the 
Tomari Nuclear Power Plant. The center combines a training 
facility already in operation and just completed new equipment 
for maintenance training. 
  An operational training facility already exists at the 
Tomari 
Nuclear Power Plant. It shares the central control panel with 
the power plant and is equipped with an educational and training 
simulator. The facility's total floor space is about 1,400 
square meters (sqm), and it has four floors above ground. So 
far, 4,500 people have received training at this facility, and 
it has played a role in raising the capability of nuclear power 
plant operators. 
  New equipment was added to the facility for maintenance 
training and to provide comprehensive education and training in 
nuclear technology. Construction began in April 1992, and was 
completed in September 1993. 
  The facility has a simulated steam generator water chamber, 
a 
steam generator heat transfer pipe inspection device, 
tank-pump-valves-pipes system training equipment, and electric 
motor equipment. The facility's total floor space is 3,000 sqm, 
and it has three floors above ground and one below ground level. 
The building area is about 800 sqm. Total construction cost was 
about &yen;4 billion. 
  The Hokkaido Electric Power Company plans to use the 
facility 
about 50 times per year to train a total of around 250 people.

  [Text] The fourth nuclear power siting promotion panel 
discussion was held on 20 October at a hotel in Tokyo. Since it 
was the first meeting after the formation of the coalition 
administration, MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and the heads of 
the electric power industry met to discuss future issues 
concerning nuclear power facility siting. In addition to 
Minister Kumagai, attending from the MITI side were both 
parliamentary vice-ministers (Sadao Wada and Motohiko Endo), 
Agency of Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) Director General 
Tomio Tsutsumi and Deputy Director General Yasuo Hayashi. The 
electric power industry side was led by Kohei Abe, chairman of 
the Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPCO), and included 
presidents of all the electric power companies from Hokkaido to 
Okinawa as well as the Japan Atomic Power Company and the 
Electric Power Development Company. 
  In his opening statement, Minister Kumagai emphasized the 
importance of environmental and other problems and, maintaining 
that the coalition administration will continue the fundamental 
policy, stressed that ``Promotion of nuclear power generation is 
extremely important.'' Minister Kumagai also asked the electric 
power industry to make ``even greater efforts to ensure safety 
and to gain the understanding of the local population in the 
work of promoting nuclear energy.'' He also expressed the 
thinking that ``It is important to promote the nuclear fuel 
cycle on the basic premises of peaceful use of nuclear energy 
and the ensuring of safety.'' 
  In response, FEPCO Chairman Abe stated that the industry 
side 
would ``work on the best mix of electric power resources,'' and 
explained the status of progress on the nuclear fuel cycle. 
  The electric power company presidents individually reported 
on the status of electric power resource sitings, especially for 
nuclear power generation, and requested more support for 
regional promotion.

  [Text] The Radioactive Waste Specialist Sub-Committee of 
the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan has gathered information 
concerning progress of research and development of high level 
radioactive waste underground disposal. In order for our country 
to get people to understand and go along with further 
development of safe nuclear energy, it is highly essential to 
obtain the public's trust in advanced technical establishment of 
radioactive waste underground disposal treatment. The basic 
points to view are: 1) investigation of the geological 
surrounding conditions, 2) disposal techniques, and 3) 
performance evaluation. A confirmation of the updated results of 
these three important research issues and in addition, emphasis 
on the necessity of future technical progress is being made. The 
general contents of the investigation are being reported in 
series. 
  The goal of our country's underground disposal research and 
development has been to concretely demonstrate the possibility 
of long term safety of the underground disposal for high level 
radioactive waste. At present, no specifications are being made 
on the type of rocks or designated areas but a wide range of 
geological surrounding conditions have been assumed. The 
disposal techniques that will cope with these environments are 
being studied and developed together, and generalized analysis 
and evaluation on the capability of the treatment system which 
has been based on the concept of the multiple barrier system has 
been in progress. For this reason, under the ``Important 
Subjects and Ways To Proceed,'' the important listings for 
research and developments have been decided on the three areas 
of: 1) survey study of geological surrounding conditions, 2) 
research and development of disposal techniques, and 3) the 
study of performance evaluation. The idea has been followed also 
in the ``Technical Report'' and the results of each study area 
have been organized respectively. The following articles report 
on the validity and progress made by the various studies 
together with the overall evaluation of its justification. 
<H5>  Systematic, Comprehensive, Organized and Useful </H5>
  Survey Study of Geological Surrounding Conditions. 
In the study of the geological surrounding conditions, the first 
objective is to look into what is considered one of the most 
important items in relation to the disposal system. That would 
mean a survey of a wide range area of our country's surface to 
the deep underground and extract its characteristics concerning 
the geological environment. The systematization should be 
measured and the data should be applied to the study on 
performance evaluation. Secondly, in preparing for the future, 
when the time comes to evaluate a specific underground site in 
detail for its geological environment, it would be necessary to 
be ready with the utmost accuracy and reliable data that has 
been inspected and accumulated efficiently. In addition, the 
goal is to have necessary technical developments available for 
analyzing and evaluating the accumulated data so it can be put 
into practical use. From the ``Technical Report,'' extraction 
was made from the accumulated report and data in the area of 
earth science, and reports that would be useful in the future 
concerning geological environments viewed from waste disposal 
interests were systemized and consolidated. At the same time, a 
survey of the development of techniques and tools so that 
precise geological environmental data can be collected is being 
pursued. Furthermore, on deep geological environmental data, the 
necessary reports for performance evaluation is being prepared 
but since the actual data is limited to a portion, it has been 
learned that collection of more data would be necessary. 
  At the present, the data concerned with geological 
environment of underground waste disposal, as far as collection 
is possible has been prepared systematically and comprehensively 
for a large area for the first time in our country. The data 
will be the basis for showing our country's characteristic 
geological surroundings and together it can be evaluated as 
useful for extracting subjects for survey studies in the future. 
<H5>  Selection of Applicable Material for Artificial Barrier </H5>
  Research and Development of Waste Disposal 
Techniques. The research and development of waste disposal 
techniques have to be a method where long term safety can be 
guaranteed. In order to clearly make this concrete, the 
essential techniques are dependent on the individual artificial 
barriers and based on it, the goal for disposal techniques 
related to site design, construction and operation must be of 
utmost trustworthy one. 
  In the ``Technical Report,'' the applicability of different 
types of material for structuring the artificial barrier have 
been compared and organized, and as a result, selections of 
example materials are displayed. Furthermore, a groundwork 
investigation of the technical feasibility of the design and 
execution of the disposal installation is being made together 
with a display of an example of a technically feasible system. 
The outlook has been that for the technical aspects necessary in 
building the artificial barrier, basically, existing technology 
will be applied for the design and the operation of the disposal 
installation. In addition, the topics for reliability 
improvements on individual essential techniques are shown and 
recommendations for future research and development are 
suggested. 
  The above shows clearly the topics necessary for research 
and 
development. It emphasizes attaining utmost technical 
reliability and establishing concrete directions for technical 
development in design, construction and execution for artificial 
barrier and for the disposal site. 
<H5>  Safety Security by Multiple Barrier System </H5>
  Performance Evaluation Studies. The study of 
performance evaluation first must begin with the possibility of 
high level radioactive waste directly affecting humans in the 
event of natural phenomena such as earthquakes and from other 
human causes and various activities. 
  Research and survey must be made on the possibility of such 
occurrence and the magnitude of its effect. In addition, an 
awareness of the notion that deep stratum underground disposal 
for high level radioactive waste is the appropriately stable 
burying ground needs to be clarified. Secondly, in the event 
that radioactive products from high level radioactive wastes 
elute into underground water, the possible effects on humans and 
the eluted quantity need to be evaluated. The goal is to use the 
basis of these results and evaluate a technically feasible 
multiple barrier system. 
  The possibilities of high level radioactive waste affecting 
humans directly caused by natural phenomena such as volcanic 
activities, upheavals and erosions have shown to be area 
dependent. Therefore, it is important to evaluate, concretely 
each individual area separately. However, according to the 
``Technical Report,'' our country's geological environment 
conditions have been already widely surveyed and studied without 
specifying designated areas. It has been shown according to such 
summarized investigation that the concept of using deep 
underground for waste disposal burial location as being stable 
has been valid in our country. At the same time, it has been 
pointed out the importance that in the event an area is 
designated, there is a need to develop technical skills and 
methods to evaluate the phenomena that may be characteristic for 
the area. 
  Next, on the technical feasibility of multiple artificial 
barrier systems, in the case of our country, the existence of 
the possibility of movement of radioactive products via 
underground water is an important consideration. Therefore, from 
this point of view, the geological surrounding conditions are 
being widely assumed and the underground water quality, its flow 
characteristics, the long term health of artificial barriers, 
and the control of the shifted radioactive products that have 
eluted through the artificial barriers etc. are being 
systematically constructed into a basic model so that the total 
multiple barrier system can be analyzed. By using this, the 
multiple barrier system's performance is being illustrated. As a 
result, when artificial barrier and disposal site can be matched 
with its geological surrounding conditions and when design and 
construction work are followed accordingly it has been shown 
that the performance of the multiple barriers can be maintained 
for a long term with safety assured. At the same time, in the 
event that appropriate design and construction work take place, 
the importance of accurate evaluation of the artificial barriers 
and its relative neighboring geological surroundings has been 
pointed out. 
  By this means, arguments concerning evaluation methods of 
multiple barrier system performances have been made clear and 
the basic model necessary for analysis is understood to have 
been built. Further, in the future, in order that a reliable 
analysis be performed, important influential elements have been 
pointed out, and also the direction to be taken for future 
performance evaluation study is being made clear. In addition, 
important knowledge of concrete techniques for safety security 
based on the multiple barrier system concept has been acquired 
and it can be assessed that the technical foundation for 
planning safety security for underground disposal treatment is 
being made very clear. 
<H3>  A Clear Statement of Concrete Know-How That is Generally 
Reasonable </H3>
  Summary of Evaluation. In the future, by 
performing further required research development and survey as 
needed, the geological environment can be grasped exquisitely 
and together, technical improvements and detailed analysis can 
be planned and it will be more and more necessary to attain high 
grade evaluation with confidence. The ``Technical Report'' 
states: 1) for the techniques necessary for designing and 
performing construction work for the artificial barriers and 
waste disposal installations, basically, existing technology can 
be applied, 2) concerning the performance of the multiple 
barrier systems, a comprehensive analytical method has been 
completed that has been centered around the performance 
evaluation of the new field (the area including artificial 
barrier and its neighboring underground), and 3) by taking into 
consideration the width of fluctuation, the results of analysis 
made on the assumed geological environmental conditions shown in 
examples indicate that if the artificial barrier and waste 
disposal installation are matched with the geological 
surroundings and the design and construction work is 
appropriate, the performance of a multiple barrier system can be 
maintained for a long duration. It clearly shows the safe and 
secure attainment in planning for an underground disposal 
treatment in our country as being technically possible. 
  Assessing the above, in summary, the underground waste 
disposal research and development contained in the ``Technical 
Report'' has followed appropriately the article ``Important 
Subjects and Ways to Proceed'' and has faithfully proceeded 
accordingly. Also, pertaining to the information on safety and 
security of underground waste disposal, the knowledge of the 
validity of multiple barrier system has been obtained. Together, 
when considering that concretely, technical methods are becoming 
distinct, and therefore, at the present stage, it can be 
concluded that, in general, the entire technology appears 
reasonable.

  [Text] With respect to future evolution of underground 
waste disposal research and development, it is based on the 
fruits of research and development mentioned in the ``Technical 
Report.'' The following are ideas to be used for enhancing the 
drive for further research and development. 
  Also, at the same time, surveys and studies in order to 
properly grasp the deep geological environment, the technical 
development of the highest level and validity for design and 
construction work of artificial barriers and disposal sites, the 
near field performance evaluation, and further advancement on 
the reliability of the multiple barrier system are considered 
especially important items. 
<H3>  Importance of Grasping the Concept of Reciprocal 
Relationship with Natural Phenomena </H3>
  Survey Studies of Geological Environment 
Conditions. With respect to geological environment 
condition survey studies, viewing from the point of underground 
waste disposal, further focus on geological environment 
condition is important in obtaining a long term safety security. 
It is necessary to develop and improve survey, measuring 
techniques and related instruments in order that highly reliable 
and substantial data of the deep underground geological 
structure, the distribution of rocks and strata, rock-bed 
materials, hydro-geology characteristics and the earth chemical 
characteristics of underground water can be accumulated. 
  On the other hand, historical records of activities created 
by natural phenomena such as volcanic activities, earthquakes, 
fault activities, upheavals and erosions, weather fluctuations, 
and changes in ocean surface should be made and together, it is 
important to evaluate the possibility of the influence these 
effects might have on the multiple barrier system. At this 
point, not only is the evaluation of individual natural 
phenomenon important but it should include into consideration 
the reciprocal relationship of each phenomenon in order to 
obtain a collective picture. Also, with natural phenomena such 
as volcanic activities which are thought to be area dependent, 
there exists the importance and necessity of appropriately 
evaluating the phenomena of the area by further developing 
evaluating methods and techniques. Furthermore, in addition to 
effects from natural phenomena, large scale human originated 
activities such as forestry conservation work and resource 
development can influence geological environment that should 
preferably be investigated. 
<H5>  Tests for Assumed Severest Conditions </H5>
  Research Development for Waste Disposal 
Techniques. With respect to research and development for 
waste disposal techniques concerning artificial barriers, upon 
clarifying the required businesses, it is necessary to perform 
research and development with strong emphasis on developing a 
highly reliable artificial barrier. In regards to overpack, a 
long term durability research and development should be 
continued for carbon steel and at the same time, it is desirable 
that materials other than carbon steel such as titanium should 
be investigated. Also, it is necessary to advance investigations 
of design and production including the soundness of welding of 
the overpack. As for the buffer, using clay (bentonite) as the 
main product should be of central concern, but other new 
material should be investigated widely on its individual 
characteristics and methods. In regards to operational methods, 
security in performance is of utmost importance and therefore, 
research and development for large scale testing is necessary. 
For the technical development of the waste disposal site design, 
construction and operation, it would be important to plan 
improvements on the basis of various elements in technology such 
that an overall combined technique composed of analytical, 
inspection and application be included. Furthermore, it is 
desirable that investigation on long term stability of caves and 
drifts be tested under assumed severe conditions for safety. 
<H5>  The Expansion of Radioactive Material Data Base </H5>
  Performance Evaluation Study. In the area of 
performance evaluation, presently, the most demanding ones are 
concerned with near field and the improvement in trust of the 
multiple barrier system. For the purpose, analytical models, 
technical skills on improvements and developments accompanied 
with reasonable confirmation, and the securing of confidence in 
the analytical data are thought to be especially important. 
  Also, by efficiently utilizing the research institution for 
performance evaluation run by Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation (PNC), a plan for a complete basic data 
and the expansion of data base that includes necessary data for 
analysis such as thermodynamics of radioactive material will be 
necessary. On the other hand, in order to grasp scientifically 
the long term phenomena, it is useful to understand natural 
phenomena. Therefore, the continued enforcement of natural 
analog study should be made together with the observation of 
kinetics pertaining to earth chemical reaction. 
<H5>  Further Raising the Level of Deep Underground Studies </H5>
  Mutual Subjects and Ways for Future Progress. In 
order to advance future research and development, the products 
yielded from the past shown in the ``Technical Reports'' should 
be further realized. The geological environmental conditions 
should be gasped even more in fineness, attainment of high level 
technology needs to be planned, and precision improvements in 
analytical skills are going to be needed. It will be pertinent 
that consideration in obtaining high level results that are 
trustworthy from all research areas is absolutely a requirement. 
In order to satisfy this, it is important to advance research 
institutions, substantiate facilities and proceed in educating 
human resources. 
  Especially, the deep underground study institution is the 
necessary base for the mutual research of survey studies of 
geological environment conditions, research and development of 
waste disposal techniques and for performance evaluation 
studies. Also, in combination, it is a useful research institute 
for educational contributions to our country's collective 
research on geology, hydrologic, earth chemistry, rock 
engineering etc. that relates to deep underground. In the case 
of PNC, it is now in progress of planning and establishing a 
research and development of underground waste disposal 
techniques that is in agreement with our country's geological 
surroundings. However, since the research and development will 
be long term, it will come under the number two overall 
collection planned by PNC prior to year 2000, and through 
federal evaluation, the progress of the research and development 
will be ascertained, and it would be necessary to further 
evaluate and examine future study policies. 
  Furthermore, in the future, in order to collectively and 
efficiently advance research and development, PNC, which is 
acting as the kernel and the propelling force, will be central 
for others such as Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, 
Geological Survey of Japan, and the federal testing and research 
system. Also cooperation from universities and active 
contributions from related civilian technical power together 
with international cooperation is going to be necessary for 
efficient advancement.

  [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC) has decided to introduce supercomputers this 
fiscal year and they will begin selecting early next year. 
  The ones planned to be introduced would be a Central 
Processing Unit (CPU) system incorporating over ten units of 
super row calculators combined with a graphic calculator and an 
operation work station. PNC already has introduced a Bechtel 
Computer System at the Information Center, at O-arai Engineer 
Center last year and this will be their second unit. The new 
unit will also be installed at the Center and it will be used 
for studies of underground waste disposal and severe event 
conditions for fast breeder reactors (FBRs). 
  At the Information Center, a CPU with one Bechtel calculator 
has already been installed and assimilation of complex phenomena 
are being treated. However, with only one CPU, it is not always 
effective for timely assimilation. For example, in research and 
development of underground waste disposal, many calculation 
codes must be combined and an event is assimilated while basic 
understanding and evaluation must be made repeatedly. At the 
same time, models are formed and systems are developed, and 
accuracy must be raised. In such cases, while trial and error is 
being repeated, tremendous number of parameter surveys are being 
made while the calculation process is being confirmed by visual 
reappearance and at the same time, it is important that 
conditions be changed during calculation in order that the best 
condition be found. In this way, while calculating, results are 
made real and visual at the work station, but with the Bechtel 
computer, it is not effective in using methods to change and 
evaluate established conditions in the midst of a calculation. 
  In contrast, with a CPU containing super rows of computers, 
it is possible to simultaneously process multiple calculation 
codes in rows at high speed. It is also possible to dynamically 
establish changes during operation and it has the advantage of 
being able to evaluate results realistically. 
  At PNC, the assimilation is to be used for real evaluation 
analysis such as for heat flow power of FBRs and also for 
various kinds of phenomena occurring in underground waste 
disposal. 
  The introduction will be decided within this fiscal year, 
installation is to be made next year, tests on the applicability 
of the existing software programs for row calculators will be 
investigated, and trial is planned for 1995. The present 
introduction has been approved under this year's revised budget 
and Science and Technology Agency has decided to introduce 
computers not only to PNC but to the Institute of Physical and 
Chemical Research and to National Aerospace Laboratory.

  [Text] The Japan Information Center for Science and 
Technology (JICST), which is the part of the Science and 
Technology Agency, and the Science and Information Center 
(NACSIS), a part of the Ministry of Education, will start to 
interconnect each of their own online networks in the beginning 
of November. JICST has 11,000 users (number of passwords issued) 
and NACSIS has 5,600 users (number of passwords issued). As a 
result of interconnecting the two networks, a giant science and 
technology information network will be realized. Although there 
are small problems of system design and user fees at present, 
the two centers have ``almost worked out the technical problems 
such as use of gateways (connectivity).'' 
  JICST is providing online information services to the 
private sector and universities with 22 of their own databases 
including a ``Science and Technology Reference File'' and a 
``Science and Technology Research Information File'' as well as 
files formed by external organizations, in which 27 million 
items of data have been collected. This will be the largest 
commercial science and technology database in Japan. 
  On the other hand, ``NACSIS - IR (Information Retrieval)'' 
provides data with 36 million items to universities, national 
joint organizations, and specialized schools with 35 kinds of 
database ranging from the natural sciences to the humanities and 
sociology, including several types of databases such as 
``Overview of Science Research Results By Supplementary Fund,'' 
``Academic Thesis and Dissertation Retrieval,'' and ``Academic 
Papers Presented.'' It is a closed circuit system in which use 
is limited to the academic institutions permitted by the 
Ministry of Education. 
  JOIS was established to meet the need for making joint 
university and national level research available to the private 
sector. From now on, the range of databases that both 
organizations will provide will be discussed, but by 
establishing a one year trial period, any problems that might 
occur can be studied. 
  Also since NACSIS is collecting fees from researchers at 
universities, the costs will decline. The approval of an 
academic discount for users of NACSIS-IR will be discussed with 
JICST. 
  Although a new password is needed if a user wants to access 
both systems, both organizations will take applications enabling 
users to access both by issuing all passwords at one time.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry and 
the Bureau of Small Businesses will form a local area technical 
network in order to improve technological development in small 
businesses. They plan to make leading-edge companies a core 
component of local area businesses. Led by prefectural public 
research institutions, a technical study will be conducted by 
uniting local manufacturing businesses, national research 
organizations, and universities. It was realized that local 
public research institutions, which play a key role in the 
technical support of local businesses, need to build a network 
in order to help effectively at the local level. In 1994, 
twenty-three prefectural institutions will participate in this 
project. They are requesting an estimated &yen;72.5 million. 
  The name of the organization is ``Foundation for the 
Formation of Local Area Technical Networks.'' At a concrete 
level, each prefecture has its own vision for the promotion of 
industrial growth. An ``Area Technical Network Committee'' will 
be established at each prefectural level. Topics to be studied 
will be determined from an educational point of view. The focus 
will be on future technical fields important for small 
businesses. At the same time the national manufacturing policy 
will be adjusted to conform with the study. 
  Furthermore, led by this committee, about five or so 
technical seminars will be held. These seminars will concentrate 
on the actual problems faced by local businesses. The technical 
power of the national level research institutions and public 
universities located in each prefecture will be harnessed. 
Exchange of ideas at local public institutions will take place, 
and the needs of local area businesses will be grasped. Solving 
technical problems and transferring the results to the 
businesses is also planned. 
  Through network exchange, the results of study will be 
transferred to businesses, and education of area businesses, 
which is the core of local vitalization, will occur, and 
stimulate the local economy. Also the activities of the study 
group conducted at a prefectural level will be integrated. MITI 
plans to support the education of competitive business ventures 
as a vital and fundamental activity in 1994, and the formation 
of area technical networks this time has the implication of 
active support from MITI.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
plans to form an information network for the material industries 
of tools and die, molding, and casting, using personal 
computers. Utilizing the capabilities of personal computer 
communication networks such as electronic bulletin boards, 
conferences, and e-mail, an information network will be 
established. At the same time, questions and demands from the 
businesses will be considered, and a system for information 
exchange will be built. Operation will be managed by the 
Material Manufacturing Center and plans call for start up in 
April, 1994. This is the first nationwide information network in 
Japan connecting the government and corporations 
bi-directionally. 
  Although materials manufacturing in Japan is an important 
pillar supporting the manufacturing sector, industrial reform is 
needed because of the protracted bad economy and the rising yen. 
For this reason, concerns over loan policies, taxation, and aids 
to fund employment, as well as the establishment of policies and 
suggestions for improvement have been increasing. However since 
the opinions are expressed to the government indirectly via the 
heads of organizations such as area business associations or 
industrial unions in each prefecture, it is difficult for the 
owner of a business to raise his voice and to be heard directly. 
  The network system based on personal computer communication 
establishes a ``Parts and Products Production Salon,'' to which 
public organizations of material related industries and 
associations will input necessary information. Electronic 
bulletin boards, electronic conferences, e-mail, and databases 
are planned for this network. For example, at an electronic 
conference, discussion of business concerns can occur. As a 
concrete plan, multiple corners including ``Opinions to MITI,'' 
``Requests to the Material Center,'' and a ``Technical PeopleUs 
Salon'' will be created. 
  Also, past question and answer sessions will be stored as 
examples, enabling small business owners to use them as a 
reference, helping them to prepare detailed steps that they can 
take for smooth action. 
  Although a personal computer communication network is 
provided by the ``MPT Online Public Announcement System,'' a 
bi-directional communication network between government and 
businesses is a first this time.

<H5>  Increasing Use on Mass Production Lines </H5>
  Uses for YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) laser industrial 
equipment are expanding. They have a wide range of uses from the 
precision welding of small parts, such as those found in 
electronics, to welding and opening holes in large parts such as 
those found in aircraft and automobile bodies. Recently, YAG 
lasers have been used to weld aluminum alloys, which had been 
considered nearly impossible to weld, and they are now beginning 
to appear on mass production lines. Moreover, there are now 
instances in which YAG lasers have been put to practical use not 
only to weld and drill holes, but also to modify the surfaces of 
materials. 
  The sales of YAG laser manufacturing equipment grew steadily 
from about 1200 units in 1989 to about 1450 units in 
1990.[.sup]1[/] In 1991, however, investments in equipment 
began to drop, and sales leveled off. Then in 1992, sales 
decreased to about 1300 units. 
  Although unit sales have fallen off, we can say that uses 
for 
YAG laser industrial equipment are expanding because that is the 
general feeling among manufacturers and users of YAG laser 
processing equipment. When we look at a rough breakdown of YAG 
laser equipment sold, welders and markers comprise about 
30% 
each, and the remaining 40% is made up of trimmers, cutoff 
machines, and hole drilling machines. The uses of YAG laser 
equipment are expanding in the fields of welding and drilling. 
<H3>  Auto, Electric Industries Look to YAG for More Precise, More 
Compact Products </H3>
  There is currently a strong move in the auto industry toward 
lightweight bodies. One effective means for making autos lighter 
is to use aluminum. However, aluminum has a high reflectance 
ratio and high heat conductance, so it has been considered 
unsuitable for laser processing. However, because the average 
output and functions of YAG lasers have improved, YAG lasers can 
now be used to weld aluminum alloys, and they have started to 
appear on mass production lines. 
  In the electric/electronics manufacturing and precision 
instrument fields, where compactness and light weight have 
already made great advances, YAG lasers are often used to make 
precision spot welds. The demand is growing stronger for high 
precision processing as the number of small parts increases. 
Noboru Taguchi (Chief of Engineering, Laser Equipment 
Operations, NEC) says, ``As parts become smaller and more 
precise, the value of using YAG lasers will become even 
greater.'' 
  The users of YAG lasers share the same view. Figure 1 shows 
a 
printer head spot welded with a YAG laser at Tosei Electrobeam 
(main office: Mizuho-cho, Tokyo), a major job shop that does the 
processing for the manufacturer. Mamoru Ueno (President, Tosei 
Electrobeam) says, ``YAG lasers, with the short wavelengths they 
emit, are best suited for this kind of microprocessing.'' Tosei 
Electrobeam currently has four YAG laser units in full operation. 



  Recently YAG lasers have found new applications in the 
modification of material surfaces. In the future they will 
surely be noted as a method for adding new functions to material 
surfaces. 
  Thus, the use of YAG laser processing has expanded into many 
areas. That is because there is growing recognition of the 
special features and excellence of YAG lasers for processing 
parts and products that require high precision, compactness, 
etc., (see boxed material, p 16). YAG laser processing is 
expanding its range in welding and hole drilling, and at the 
same time opening new territory in the field of surface 
modification. 
<H5>  Welding </H5>
  Aluminum is a difficult material to weld because of its high 
reflectance ratio. Moreover, it has 4-5 times the heat 
conductance of iron, so any absorbed heat immediately 
dissipates, making localized heating very difficult. Laser beams 
with very high output are effective in overcoming these 
problems. Therefore, when we consider the welding of aluminum 
from the standpoint of output, there is a good argument at this 
point for using CO[.sup]2[/] lasers, which can generate even 
higher output than YAG lasers. However, the YAG laser is a tool 
that is hard to give up on.[.sup]2[/] 
  First of all, there is a general trend for reflectance 
ratios 
in metals to decrease as the wavelength of the light grows 
shorter. Therefore, YAG lasers, which emit light at a wavelength 
of 1.06 m, have an advantage over CO[.sup]2[/] lasers with 
longer their wavelength of 10.6 m. In the case of aluminum, 
the reflectance ratio for a CO[.sup]2[/] laser is a high 
96%, but is 80% for a YAG laser. Or looking at 
this in terms 
of the rate of absorption, only 4% of CO[.sup]2[/] laser 
light is absorbed compared with 20% of YAG laser light. 
  Moreover, the output waveform emitted by YAG lasers can be 
varied, and this can be used to control the amount of heat gain 
to the material. By using this feature, it is possible to 
improve the welding of metal surfaces with high reflectance 
ratios such as aluminum alloys and copper, and mirror-like 
materials with smooth surfaces. 
  Although the continuous emission output of CO[.sup]2[/] 
lasers is greater than that of YAG lasers, YAG lasers are 
superior to CO[.sup]2[/] lasers because they can generate a 
peak output of several tens of kilowatts instantaneously by 
pulsed emission. 
  For these reasons, research both by manufacturers and users 
on aluminum alloy welding by YAG laser has advanced along with 
the development of high output YAG lasers (see boxed material, p 
18). 
<H3>  First Application of Aluminum Alloy Welding--Auto Hood 
Production Line </H3>
  As all this research on aluminum alloy welding proceeded, 
the 
Mazda Motor Corporation jumped ahead of the competition and 
became the first company to make a practical application of YAG 
lasers for aluminum alloy welding. Mazda installed YAG lasers on 
its aluminum hood production line, and they began operation in 
May 1992. The aluminum hoods welded by laser are used on the 
Efini RX-7, Efini MS-9 and Sentia models, and a monthly 
production amounts to 4000-5000 units each (Fig. 2 [not 
reproduced]). 
  The auto industry is striving to use more aluminum parts to 
increase fuel efficiency. The present condition, however, is 
that the high reflectance and heat conductance ratios of 
aluminum have hindered progress so much that adopting aluminum 
parts has been reduced mostly to lip service. 
  Mazda, however, moved aggressively to use aluminum for body 
parts, such as choosing to use an aluminum hood on its RX-7 for 
export to the U.S. in 1985. As far as the weight of the body is 
concerned, the hood is particularly important. Therefore, Mazda 
chose the hood as one of its targets for reducing the weight of 
the body and managed to cut the weight of the hood to 10 kg, 
roughly half the weight of previous steel hoods, by switching to 
aluminum in its Efini RX-7 that went on sale domestically in 
December 1991, for example. 
  Before Mazda introduced YAG lasers in May 1992, it assembled 
aluminum hoods with MIG welding. However, because the MIG 
welding was performed by hand, there was a small amount of 
variation depending on which employee did the welding, and there 
was a tendency for unevenness to appear in places where the 
surface of the hood was welded. Moreover, even when the same 
employee did the welding, it was difficult to maintain 
consistency in all the weld locations. 
  Therefore, to improve the appearance it was necessary to 
introduce a polishing step after the welding to smooth down the 
surface of the hood several micrometers. The polishing operation 
generated dust, which degraded the work environment and created 
another problem. 
  To overcome these problems, Mazda introduced YAG lasers by 
combining optical fiber and robotics technology to automate the 
welding process and eliminate the dust. 
<H3>  YAG Lasers To Be Used in Future To Reduce Weld Defects by 
Control of Output Waveform </H3>
  The maximum average output of these YAG lasers is 800 W, but 
the maximum peak output is 10 kW. The laser is combined with one 
robot and 10 meters of optical fiber (Fig. 3). Welding uses a 
pulsed laser beam. The time required to weld one hood, including 
the time to transport the part and the time used for the 
movement of the robot arm, is about 1 minute 50 seconds. 



  The hood consists of two sheets of 1 mm thick 5000-series 
(Al-Mg series) aluminum alloy welded together (Fig. 4). The 
perimeter of the outer metal sheet is folded over so that it 
encloses the inner sheet. If we look at a cross section of the 
edge of the hood, it appear to be constructed from three sheets 
of metal. 



  What is welded by YAG laser is the perimeter consisting of 
three sheets folded over each other: 15 locations on the RX-7 
and 18 on the Sentia. The depth of penetration at each weld is 
about 1.3-1.4 mm, and the length of each weld is about 20 mm. 
  During trials weld defects such as cracks and pinholes 
occurred in the aluminum alloy because of rapid cooling after 
exposure to the laser beam. However, Chinobu Iwashita (Manager, 
2nd Body Engineering Group, Mazda Engineering Division) 
explained, ``We reduced the number of weld defects by accurate 
control of the waveform generated by the laser.'' One strength 
of YAG lasers is the fact that heat gain can be controlled by 
controlling the output waveform. 
  Mr. Iwashita continued, ``We want to aggressively employ YAG 
lasers with the goal of using aluminum alloys for parts other 
than the hood such as the trunk and doors.'' Mazda also plans to 
study using YAG lasers to weld metals other than aluminum alloys 
such as iron and zinc galvanized steel sheet. 
<H3>  New Type of Motorcycle Exhaust Chamber Requiring Lighter 
Weight and Greater Precision </H3>
  The Yamaha Motor Company, with the cooperation of Sakura 
Industries (main office: Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture), 
introduced YAG lasers for the assembly of the collecting portion 
(exhaust chamber) of the exhaust pipe, which is part of their 
motorcycle mufflers.[.sup]3[/] The exhaust chamber Yamaha is 
assembling with YAG lasers has a brand new construction, and it 
is mounted on the sports models FZR400 and FZR250 (Fig. 5 [not 
reproduced]). 
  With high rpm engines, some parts of engine performance fall 
off as the engine's speed increases. This phenomenon occurs 
because there is a long period of overlap in which both intake 
and exhaust valves are open. 
  When the overlap period is long, it is hard for the fuel 
mixture to enter the cylinder if the exhaust valve is open 
because the exhaust is under positive pressure as the fuel 
mixture tries to enter the cylinder. This is because the exhaust 
is reflected by the chamber and silencer, and the pressure wave 
rebounding into the cylinder interferes with the fuel mixture's 
entering the cylinder. As a result, combustion falters and 
engine performance drops. 
  Therefore, Yamaha developed a new type of exhaust chamber 
that can control the exhaust gas pressure. A tapered rotating 
valve opens and shuts, and this design controls the pressure of 
the exhaust gas from idle through high speed (Fig. 6). 



  Because the chamber is the area where the exhaust gas 
converges, it gets very hot and vibrates severely, so it must 
have great strength. It must also be very precise. This is 
especially important for the tapered part of the chamber where 
the valve slides. If the radial precision is poor in this area, 
there is a chance that the valve will stick and fail to function 
properly. 
  During initial development Yamaha used a cast stainless 
steel 
chamber that had been machine processed. However, Naohisa 
Takahashi (Materials Research Manager, 2nd Research Department, 
Yamaha Engineering Headquarters) said, ``We found it difficult 
to process the tapered area with good precision and maintain 
thin walls for light weight.'' There were also problems because 
the casting and processing costs were high. 
<H3>  Welding 4 Pipes into Single Unit: Alternately Using 2 
Optical Fibers </H3>
  Therefore, Yamaha adopted a manufacturing method in which 
they stamp a 1.2mm thick stainless steel sheet into a body and 
four pipes, and then weld these together to form the chamber. 
The YAG laser is used to weld these four independent pipes into 
a single unit (Fig. 7). Yamaha chose a YAG laser because it was 
easy to add to the production line, and its welds have few 
distortions. 



  The YAG laser used by Yamaha is in the 400 W output class, 
and it uses two optical fibers 2 meters long. One optical fiber 
is used for welding the top and bottom of the chamber, and the 
other is used for welding the tapered area. The laser beam is 
switched between the two, and the two optical fibers are used 
one after the other. 
  The welding sequence is as follows: first the tapered areas 
of the four pipes are aligned and set in a jig. Then the top is 
welded in three locations by a pulsed laser beam from the 
optical fiber for welding the top and bottom faces (Fig. 8). The 
pulsed laser beam overlaps the beads to complete the welding. 
Next the workpiece is turned over and the bottom face is welded 
in three locations in the same manner. Finally, the laser beam 
is switched over to the optical fiber for welding the tapered 
area, and it welds the tapered area. 



  During this process, if the welding speed is too fast, the 
beads fail to overlap, and gaps form between them. If a chamber 
is mounted on a bike in this condition, air will leak into the 
tapered area through these gaps while the bike is running, 
causing afterburning. This produces loud noise, and in severe 
cases breaks the muffler. Therefore, it is dangerous to perform 
the welding too quickly. On the other hand, when it is 
impossible to install a lot of laser equipment from the cost 
standpoint, it is necessary to speed up the weld time as much as 
possible to increase production capacity. Taking these factors 
into consideration, Yamaha chose a weld speed of 3-5 mm/sec. 
  By installing the YAG lasers Yamaha was able to make the 
chamber 40% lighter than the original cast chamber and to 
cut 
processing costs by 30% as well. Yamaha is planning to 
use YAG 
lasers for welding other parts in the future. 
<H3>  YAG Lasers Used To Make Heat Sensor by Welding Thin 
Stainless Steel Sheet to Iron </H3>
  There are more and more cases where YAG lasers are used in 
the manufacture of electronic instrument parts. Matsushita 
Electric Works is making active use of YAG lasers in its 
manufacturing processes in a number of ways. One of these is a 
heat detector that is used to detect fires, etc. 
  The heat sensor consists of a stainless steel diaphragm 20 
m thick and a heat-sensing iron plate 200 m thick (Fig. 
9). The YAG laser is used to weld the diaphragm to the 
heat-sensing plate, and the welded area extends around the 
perimeter of the diaphragm. 



  Diaphragms on previous heat sensors were made of 
copper-based 
materials and were attached to the heat-sensing plate by solder. 
However, copper-based materials corrode easily, and there were 
questions about reliability. To overcome this problem, 
Matsushita chose to use stainless steel as a diaphragm material. 
  Stainless steel, however, cannot be soldered. Moreover, 
because the stainless steel sheet used as a diaphragm is very 
thin, according to Yoshimitsu Nakamura (Chief Engineer, 
Matsushita Electric Works Production Engineering Research 
Institute), ``It will become uncontrollably distorted,'' if a 
large amount of heat is conveyed to the surrounding area when it 
is attached to the heat-sensing plate. Therefore, Matsushita 
installed a pulse excitation YAG laser that enables localized 
heating to weld the stainless steel sheet. The time required to 
weld one diaphragm is about 5 seconds. 
  There is another area where Matsushita uses the YAG laser in 
addition to this welding. The detector must operate faithfully 
in case of fire, but it must not be activated by the gradually 
rising temperatures of midsummer. Therefore, a small hole is 
opened in the flange so that the flange expands only when the 
temperature rises rapidly. 
  When the temperature rises slowly, air escapes from the hole 
and the flange does not expand. On the other hand, the air 
inside the detector expands all at once in a fire, so even if 
some air escapes through the hole, the flange will expand and 
the detector will work. This is an extremely small hole with a 
diameter of 22 m, which is barely visible to the naked eye. 
Matsushita uses the YAG laser to drill this hole. 
<H5>  YAG Laser Built into Press To Weld Thin Laminated Sheets </H5>
  The magnetic head core used in audio equipment is a part 
consisting of several thin layered sheets. The thinner the 
sheets, the better the frequency properties, etc., so steps are 
being taken to make these sheets thinner. 
  Kuroda Precision Industries developed the Laser FASTEC 
System, which stamps out thin sheets about 0.1 mm thick, forms 
them into layers, and welds the layers together with a YAG laser 
to make the single unit. Kuroda began to use this system in the 
mass production of magnetic head cores in 1992 (Fig. 
10).[.sup]4[/] 



  The company originally had a die system called the FASTEC 
System. This system performed the functions of stamping out the 
thin sheets on a press and arranging them into layers. The 
method of joining the layered sheets on this system was to 
emboss the sheets and caulk them. 
  However, the sheets became so thin that it was no longer 
possible to add embossments on the press. To form embossments on 
a thin sheet, the press must be controlled to micrometer 
precision. According to Nobuaki Iguchi (Head of Development, 
Kuroda Precision Industries), ``Either you get no dimple or the 
press punches through the sheet and opens a hole,'' if this 
precision control is not possible. Moreover, the number of small 
parts that cannot accommodate embossments has increased. 
  Therefore, Kuroda build a YAG laser into the FASTEC system, 
and developed the Laser FASTEC System that welds the sheets 
together instead of caulking them. 
  The thin sheets cut by the press are stacked one after the 
other, and as each thin sheet is added, it is welded in place by 
the laser built into the die. The laser beam is conveyed into 
the die by a maximum of 8 optical fibers, and it can weld 8 
spots at the same time. The generation of the laser beam is 
synchronized with the movement of the die so that it fires when 
the moving platen of the die is raised. 
  The optical fibers used in this system are 5 meters long. 
There is a lot of vibration around the system because of the 
stamping operation, but because the laser generator is located a 
short distance away, it is not affected much by the vibration. 
Further, dies require routine maintenance such as removing dust, 
and the dies are often changed. These operations become 
difficult if the structure of the line is complex. However, a 
spokesman for Kuroda Precision Industries emphasizes the 
additional merits of the YAG laser system by saying, ``Because 
this system uses optical fiber, the line is not complex and 
these operations are not difficult to perform.'' 
<H5>  Drilling Holes </H5>
  In addition to welding, YAG lasers are used extensively to 
drill holes. This covers a wide range of products such as 
automobiles, aircraft, home appliances, etc., and the holes vary 
widely both in size and shape. 
<H3>  Lasers Used To Drill Variety of Holes in Auto Bodies: 
Reduces Number of Dies and Amount of Inventory </H3>
  There are cases in which the change from past processing 
methods to YAG laser processing has resulted in great 
advantages. One example comes from the Toyota Motor Corporation. 
  Toyota installed a YAG laser system to drill holes in 
exterior body panels, and it began operation in June 1990 (Fig. 
11 [not reproduced]). In the past Toyota stamped out the holes 
on presses, but switched to using YAG lasers to reduce the 
number of dies and the amount of inventory. 
  Toyota uses a YAG laser with a maximum average output of 200 
W, but the holes are drilled with a pulsed laser beam. The body 
panels are zinc galvanized steel 0.8-1.0 mm thick. The holes 
drilled by laser are for attaching the license plates, 
installing antennas, etc., and they include a variety of shapes 
such as round, square, and oblong and a size range of 4-20 mm in 
diameter. About 15 holes per vehicle are drilled by laser on ten 
models such as the Vista, Corolla, and Hi-Lux. 
  YAG lasers are installed on all six production lines in four 
plants such as those at Takaoka and Tsutsumi. The models they 
manufacture have various specifications. One example is the 
steering column specifications. Depending on whether the car is 
a right-hand or left-hand drive, the hole for the steering 
column must be opened on either the right or left side of the 
dashboard panel. To respond to these various specifications, it 
is necessary to install the YAG lasers on both sides of the 
line. Therefore, three of the six lines have only one YAG laser 
unit and the other three lines have two. There is one robot for 
each laser generator. 
  The hole drilling at Toyota is not merely a matter of 
opening 
a small hole by melting and evaporating the material. Some holes 
are cut out by moving the laser beam. This generates scrap as a 
result. Masao Kawase (Engineering Control Department, 2nd 
Production Engineering Division, Toyota Motor Corporation) said, 
``Getting rid of this scrap material presented a problem.'' 
  To keep the scrap from falling, a magnet was attached to the 
tip of the robot arm. The magnet directly picks up the scrap 
generated after the hole is opened and removes it from the line. 
The robot throws away a piece of scrap material each time a hole 
is opened. During this process, sensors located outside the line 
check each time to make sure that the robot has actually removed 
the piece of scrap. 
  In the past, body panel holes were opened by stamping, but 
there were two problems. One was that a different die was needed 
for each model and its specifications. As a result, it was 
necessary to build a lot more dies to correspond to the increase 
in model numbers. 
  Another problem was inventory. Among production processes, 
opening holes is a relatively fast operation. Once the holes 
have been made, the specifications for that body panel are set. 
Therefore, it was necessary to keep a large inventory for each 
different specification. To cut down on inventory, it was 
necessary to shift the hole opening process, which sets the 
specifications, as far down the production line as possible. 
  With YAG laser processing no dies are needed. Moreover, it 
is 
possible to place the hole opening process near the end of the 
production line, which provides processing flexibility since the 
holes can be drilled in response to the specifications needed at 
that time. Toyota plans to try YAG lasers in the processing of 
aluminum alloy material in the future. 
<H5>  YAG Laser Drills 630 Cooling Holes in Gas Turbine Blade </H5>
  YAG lasers were installed at the Takasago Plant of 
Mitsubishi 
Heavy Industries, which manufactures industrial gas turbines, in 
February 1991 to drill cooling holes in turbine blades, and they 
went on line in April 1991.[.sup]5[/] The material used in 
the turbine blades is a heat-resistant cobalt-based alloy. The 
YAG lasers have an maximum average output of 230-240 W, and a 
maximum peak output of 20 kW. 
  Users desire high gas temperatures at the turbine inlet in 
order to increase turbine efficiency, and in the case of high 
efficiency turbines the temperature may reach a maximum of 
1350C. Naturally, the harshest conditions fall on the first 
level of stationary blades located closest to the hot inlet 
gases. 
  Therefore, Mitsubishi is drilling a large number of holes in 
the stationary blades to keep the temperatures at their surface 
cooler (Fig. 12 [not reproduced]). Compressed air flows through 
the inside of blades and erupts through the holes to cover its 
surface and form a kind of protective barrier. This air cooling 
not only lowers the surface temperature of the stationary blades 
to 750-800C, but also extends blade life. 
  The number of holes the YAG laser drills in the stationary 
blades depends on the type of gas turbine. In types where the 
inlet temperature reaches 1250C, about 150 holes are 
needed, and in types where the temperature reaches 1350C, 
about 630 holes are needed. In the case of the 1350C type, 
the laser drills about 200 cooling holes in the stationary 
blades for the second row as well. 
  The hole diameters range from about 1.0-2.5 mm, and the 
parts 
of the blade where the holes are drilled range from 3-7 mm 
thick. These holes are not always perpendicular to the surface 
and sometimes fall at about 30-45 angles. Holes drilled at 
these angles are sometimes more than 10 mm long. 
  The spot of the laser beam is only about 0.5 mm in diameter, 
much smaller than the holes. Therefore, first the laser beam 
drills straight through, and then is moved in a circular motion 
to widen the hole by melting and evaporating the workpiece 
material. A protective plate is inserted into the blade to 
protect areas outside the processing site from laser beam damage. 
  In the past, these cooling holes were drilled by electric 
discharge processing equipment at the Takasago Plant. This 
method was not efficient, however, because it required changing 
jigs and electrodes to accommodate holes of different angles and 
locations. Early in 1991 there was an upsurge in turbine orders, 
and Mitsubishi had to find a more efficient way to produce them. 
They chose to install YAG lasers because of their high 
processing capability. 
  Hiroyuki Fukunishi (Blade Section Manager, Takasago Plant 
Manufacturing Department, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) says, 
``We increased our processing efficiency from 4 to 10 times,'' 
by installing YAG lasers while maintaining precision equal to 
that of electric discharge processing. Moreover, YAG lasers can 
be used on ceramic-coated stationary blades, which cannot be 
processed by electric discharge because of conductivity problems. 
  The Takasago Plant plans to install another YAG laser unit 
this summer, and will try to use YAG lasers for moving blades as 
well in the future. 
<H5>  YAG Lasers Also Used for High-Precision Aircraft Turbines </H5>
  For exactly the same reasons, cooling holes are drilled in 
the turbine blades of jet engines for aircraft. 
  Japan Turbine Technology (main office: Daiei Town, Chiba 
Prefecture) began using YAG lasers in 1991 for the repair and 
processing of cooling holes in turbine stationary blades for jet 
engines.[.sup]6[/] This company was established in 1988 as a 
joint venture between Japan Air Lines and Nippon Steel, mainly 
for the purpose of repairing jet engine turbines of large 
commercial aircraft. 
  The high pressure turbines in large jet engines operate in 
combustion gases at temperatures exceeding 1300C and 
pressures exceeding 2.5 MPa (25 atmospheres), and at the high 
speed of about 9000 rpm. Because the turbine blades are 
operating under such harsh conditions, they are repaired after 
every 10,000 hours of flying time. 
  Repair is performed on each blade after it is removed from 
the engine (Fig. 13 [not reproduced]). During repairs the 
cooling holes get plugged because of retouching performed on the 
whole surface of the blade such as brazing over areas where 
cracks have formed. The company uses YAG lasers to reopen the 
plugged holes. The YAG laser used by Japan Turbine Technology 
has a maximum average output of 400 W and a maximum peak output 
of 20 kW. 
  The thickness at the areas where the holes are opened in the 
stationary blade is about 2 mm, but just as in the case of the 
gas turbines, many holes lie at an angle to the surface, and 
some lie at an angle of only 6 with respect to the surface. 
The hole diameters are about 0.5-0.6 mm, and number 550-560 on 
each blade. The number of cooling holes is greater for engines 
of higher output. Just like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan 
Turbine Technology uses a method so that the laser beam will not 
damage other parts of the blade when it opens the holes. 
  High precision is required to control the flow volume of 
cooling air in jet engine turbine blades. Even a small error 
will badly affect efficiency and lead to blade damage. 
Therefore, the hole shape and surface smoothness must be 
controlled with high precision processing. Yoshimichi Moroi 
(Engineering Section Manager, Engineering Department, Japan 
Turbine Technology) says, ``The most important factor is to find 
optimal conditions that hold the heating effects to a minimum 
during processing.'' 
<H5>  Trimming Rotor Surfaces on Motors To Achieve Dynamic Balance </H5>
  All the hole processing we have discussed thus far has 
involved opening holes all the way through material. However, 
there is also processing that involves trimming away small areas 
and making indentations. 
  Hair dryers have a compact motor that revolves at a high 
speed of 10,000-20,000 rpm. Therefore, it is necessary to 
achieve dynamic balance in the rotors just as the tires on an 
auto need to be balanced. Poor dynamic balance results in 
vibration, noise and shortened lifetime. 
  In the past a drill was used to trim places that disrupted 
the balance. However, that method was not efficient because each 
time the rotor was trimmed, it had to be checked to see whether 
it was in balance or not. Therefore, Matsushita Electric Works 
installed a YAG laser to improve production efficiency. 
  Figure 14 shows the production line where dynamic balance is 
achieved with the YAG laser. The rotors that arrive are first 
mounted on a measuring device called a balancer and spun at 1500 
rpm. During this process the balancer base will begin to vibrate 
if the rotor is out of balance. Sensors mounted on the balancer 
detect the locations and amounts of imbalance. 



  After the amounts of imbalance and their locations are 
specifically determined, the rotor is moved directly below the 
laser while it is still spinning, and the laser beam fires as 
each location comes into alignment. The laser beam gradually 
trims away the imbalanced areas to correct the balance (Fig. 15 
[not reproduced]). 
  This corrective operation is performed on two separate 
stages 
on a single generator. While measurements are being taken on one 
stage, the laser beam is trimming the surface on the other 
stage. This is accomplished by changing the path of the laser 
beam by moving a prism inside the generator and alternately 
sending the beam to the two stages. 
  Norio Yoshida (Senior Engineer, High Energy Processing 
Development Lab, Production Engineering Research laboratory, 
Matsushita Electric Works) says, ``From measurement to 
correction, the time required to balance each rotor is only 
about 5 seconds,'' so the introduction of the YAG laser has 
increased operating efficiency. As many as 300,000 rotors a 
month are processed by this method. 
<H5>  Surface Modification </H5>
  YAG lasers are not only used for welding and opening holes. 
Recently the move to use YAG lasers as a means for modifying 
surfaces has attracted attention. 
  Surface modification is a method of providing the surface of 
a material with new functions by building up another substance 
on top of it (cladding). One example is adding metal powder to 
the surface of a material that must be corrosion and wear 
resistant, and then exposing that area to a YAG laser beam to 
melt the metal (Fig. 16). 



<H3>  Surface Modification of Inside Wall of Easily Corroded Thin 
Tube with 100 Meter Long Optical Fiber </H3>
  The Engineering Laboratory of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy 
Industries Company is one place using YAG lasers for surface 
modification. This lab has combined a YAG laser and a 100 meter 
long optical fiber to perform surface modifications on 
structural material requiring corrosion 
resistance.[.sup]7,8[/] 
  This technique is being used on the inside walls of 
stainless 
steel pipes in existing nuclear power plants. Stainless steel 
pipes suffer a localized loss of corrosion resistance when 
exposed to a large amount of heat such as welding. Moreover, the 
narrowest of these pipes has an inside diameter of only 40 mm. 
  Therefore, this is a preventive maintenance technique 
developed by Ishikawajima-Harima to fight corrosion in which an 
optical fiber is passed through the pipe and a YAG laser beam is 
used to form a cladding layer on areas with reduced corrosion 
resistance. For example, surface modification is possible on a 
site 10 cm wide at the tip of a pipe 5 meters long. 
  Welding is a method generally used in surface modification. 
Welding forms a protective layer by pounding the metal powder 
into the substrate. However, because the coating is not 
chemically bonded to the substrate, it has relatively poor 
adherence and easily becomes porous. Therefore welding is not 
suited for surface modification of structural material when the 
purpose is to increase corrosion resistance. 
  On the other hand, when a laser beam is used for surface 
modification the metal coating and the substrate are bonded 
metallurgically, so there is good adherence and the atoms in the 
structure are tightly packed. Moreover, the heating effects on 
the substrate are minimized since a small area can be 
selectively fused. 
  Currently high-output CO[.sup]2[/] lasers are often used 
for laser beam surface modification. However, because the 
equipment is large and optical fiber cannot be used, 
CO[.sup]2[/] lasers cannot be used in on-site operations 
where surface modifications must be performed inside existing 
plants. 
  Therefore, Ishikawajima-Harima researchers thought that if a 
YAG laser and optical fiber could be used, it would be possible 
to expose narrow spaces and the insides of pipes in existing 
facilities easily with a laser. Until now, there has been no 
method for forming a dense, highly adherent coating in narrow 
spaces such as the insides of pipes. 
<H3>  Expectations Grow for Low Output Laser Beam as Surface 
Modification Tool </H3>
  The actual procedure for surface modification is as follows: 
first the metal powder is mixed with an organic solvent binder 
to form a paste. In the case of the insides of stainless steel 
pipes it is effective to form a cladding layer with a high 
chrome-high nickel-molybdenum series metal for corrosion 
resistance, so the powder consists of a mixture of these metals. 
  Next a special device is used to form a uniform coating of 
this metal powder paste in the pipe. The thickness of the 
coating is roughly 0.2-1.0 mm. After coating is completed, a YAG 
laser beam is passed through the pipe via an optical fiber, and 
the metal powder coating is exposed. The direction of the beam 
is altered by a reflective mirror. The reflective mirror is 
rotated as the laser beam torch is withdrawn, and this creates a 
continuous bead [like a pipe thread] that forms the cladding 
layer. 
  The laser used in this process is a continuous wave type 
with 
an output of about 400 W and an exposure rate of about 0.2 
meters/minute. Norio Morishige (Specialist Manager, Bonding 
Research Department, Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Research 
Lab) says, ``For example, a YAG laser with about 500 W of output 
can perform surface modifications comparable to a 
CO[.sup]2[/] laser with a 2 kW output.'' The reason 
low-output YAG lasers can be used for surface modifications is 
because the YAG laser wavelength is shorter than the 
CO[.sup]2[/] laser wavelength, and it is absorbed more by the 
exposed material. 
  Researchers at Ishikawajima-Harima want to apply this YAG 
laser surface modification technique to exterior surfaces of 
structural materials requiring high temperature and wear 
resistance, and they are involved in developing a practical 
device. Mr. Morishige continues, ``The YAG laser is fully 
suitable for surface modification. We want to find uses for it 
in many places.'' 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The uses of YAG lasers have steadily grown. However, Mr. 
Nakamura from Matsushita Electric Works says, ``It will be a 
shame if we do not find new uses for YAG lasers. Not only 
production engineers, but also product designers and developers 
need to realize the advantages of YAG lasers and consider the 
uses of YAG lasers as tools during the design stages'' in order 
to expand the uses of YAG lasers even more. Using YAG lasers 
will contribute to the development of products with higher added 
value. 
  However, problems still remain for manufacturers and users 
of 
YAG lasers to solve if they are to find wider applications. For 
example, the biggest obstacle to the purchase of the processing 
equipment is high cost. Although costs have come down over the 
past two or three years, users still have a strong feeling that 
YAG lasers are expensive. They still seem expensive compared to 
the CO[.sup]2[/] lasers that cost &yen;10 million per 
kilowatt. 
  As Yoshio Kohara (Operations Manager, Laser Operations 
Center, Sumitomo Heavy Industries) says, ``The cost is 
approaching that of CO[.sup]2[/] lasers'' because advances in 
technology have made construction of the power source, etc., 
less expensive. Some users have said that if the cost comes down 
they will purchase more YAG lasers, so we can expect 
manufacturers to make attempts to lower the cost in the future. 
  Furthermore, in terms of the hardware, although it is now 
possible to control the output waveform with timing, it is not 
possible to control the laser beam intensity distribution 
electrically. There is an optimal intensity distribution for 
processing each type of material. Some users are requesting 
capability to freely change the distribution of the beam 
intensity such as an intensity with a Gaussian distribution or 
an intensity that shows a different distribution. 
  There are also problems with users. Developing products with 
high added value by using laser processing falls under the realm 
of industrial secrets, and there is a tendency for companies to 
hide the fact that they are using lasers. This also slows the 
spread of YAG lasers.

<H3>  Three-Dimensional Processing by Sending Laser Beam Through 
Optical Fiber and Combining with Robot </H3>
  YAG lasers have many different features, and the most 
appealing one is that the laser beam can be conveyed flexibly 
from the generator to the processing site via an optical fiber 
made of SiO[.sup]2[/] (quartz). 
  At the Takasago Laboratory of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, 
for example, researchers an send a laser beam about 225 meters 
through an optical fiber. They have developed and applied a 
method for making welding repairs of damaged areas in steam 
generator heat conducting tubes in nuclear power 
plants.[.sup]a[/] The wavelength from a YAG laser is a short 
1.06 m, which is almost entirely reflected by the 
SiO[.sup]2[/], so it can be sent through an optical fiber. 
  One advantage of using optical fiber is that 
three-dimensional processing can easily be performed when it is 
combined with a robot. If the laser beam emitted from a single 
generator is split among several optical fibers, it can be used 
in multiple lines (Fig. A) It is also possible to perform 
processing on the same workpiece at several locations at the 
same time. 



  On the other hand, the laser beam from a CO[.sup]2[/] 
laser with a wavelength of 10.6 m is absorbed by the 
SiO[.sup]2[/], so it cannot be passed through optical fiber. 
Therefore, the laser beam must be sent from the generator to the 
processing site by multiple mirrors, so the system tends to get 
rather complex. 
  Furthermore, most CO[.sup]2[/] laser processing devices 
are large structures that straddle the production line and are 
called gate-type devices. Therefore, if the production line 
needs to be changed around, it is a major task to move this huge 
piece of equipment. However, with YAG lasers there is no need to 
move the whole unit, but merely reroute the path of the optical 
fibers.[.sup]b[/]

<H3>  YAG Lasers Achieve High Output and New Makers Appear One 
After Another </H3>
  YAG lasers are achieving high levels of output. In the past, 
almost all YAG lasers had an average output of less than 1 kW, 
but beginning in 1989, YAG lasers with more than 1 kW of output 
began to appear. At present, the most powerful ones available 
commercially have reached 2.4 kW and are sold by Toshiba, etc. 
Moreover, various manufacturers are heavily involved in R&amp;D 
right now with the goal of achieving even higher output. 
  For example, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries developed 
a 
YAG laser with a maximum output of 3 kW in November 1992, and it 
is currently at the testing stage on its way to 
commercialization. In September 1992 Sumitomo Heavy Industries 
announced that it would sell a 2 kW YAG laser and is already 
receiving inquiries about it. Moreover, a 2.4 kW YAG laser 
developed by the Hobart Corporation in the U.S. went on sale in 
March in Japan from Indeko [phonetic] (main office: Tokyo). 
  The high output YAG lasers these companies are shooting for 
will be used for trimming and welding large parts. As the output 
increases, processing speed also increases. For example, they 
can be used for trimming and welding zinc galvanized steel 
sheets with large surface areas like those used in automobiles. 
Another target for these high output YAG lasers is trimming and 
welding aluminum alloys. 
  What has become conspicuous over the past few years as YAG 
lasers have achieved higher output is the increase in the number 
of Japanese companies forming affiliations with foreign laser 
equipment makers and those entering the YAG laser field anew. 
For example, in 1989 Sumitomo Heavy Industries purchased the 
Canadian company Lumonics, and entered the YAG laser field. 
  In 1991 Fanuc, Ltd. purchased a partial technical license 
from General Electric. Also in 1991 Hoya purchased the U.S. 
company Continuum Electrooptics and also invested capital in the 
German company MLS (Munich Laser Systems). These new arrivals 
have already put commercial products on the market. We can 
expect the competition in development and sales of YAG lasers to 
become even more intense in the future.
