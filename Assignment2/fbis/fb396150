and Industry] 
  [Text] Thanks to the progress made in international space 
development efforts in recent years, topics related to space 
technology are becoming increasingly familiar to the people. For 
example, the images of cloud patterns over and around Japan, 
which are sent by the meteorological satellite "Himawari," are 
shown on television every day. The number of households 
subscribing to satellite broadcasting service exceeds 4 million. 
In addition, we are communicating with people in foreign 
countries using the international telephone service offered via 
communications satellites. In recent years, the use of the 
global positioning system (GPS) satellite launched by the United 
States is expanding from use on ships to use in cars, as well as 
to portable use by individuals. 
  The space industry has been promoting the use of the space 
technology that makes it possible to offer these services. The 
industry comprises the space hardware production industry which 
manufactures satellites and rockets, etc.; the space utilization 
industry which offers broadcasting, communications, 
meteorological and earth observation services; and the 
space-related service industry which offers various services, 
including database services using satellites. As their markets 
continue to expand, these industries are beginning to experience 
increased competition on the international market. Under these 
circumstances, the Japanese space industry is experiencing a 
turning point that is expected to continue up to around the year 
2000. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has 
been promoting a number of programs aimed at encouraging the use 
of space technology and services in Japan. These programs have 
been promoted through increased cooperation with the 
organizations devoted to promoting the use of space technology 
and other space-related establishments in foreign countries. In 
promoting these programs, the ministry took into consideration 
the recent progress being made in global information exchange 
services and the urgency of tackling the problem of the earth's 
deteriorating environment. 
  Figure 1 [not reproduced] outlines the current system in 
Japan aimed at promoting space development and the use of space 
technology. Table 1 explains the contents of MITI's budgets for 
space development in FY91 and 92. This paper will outline MITI's 
policy for promoting domestic space industry.

<H3>  Promotion of Utilization of Satellite-Based Remote Sensing 
Technology </H3>
  Remote sensing technology, which involves earth observation 
from satellites, is one space technology in which the demand for 
the technology is expected to increase for applications not only 
involving meteorological observation, but also for natural 
resource exploration, environmental observation and geographical 
survey. Japan has launched a series of meteorological satellites 
(GMS: Himawari) and a series of marine observation satellites 
(MOS-1a and MOS-1b) to conduct space research and development 
and to promote the use of space satellites. In February 1992, 
Japan launched a natural resource exploration satellite (JERS-1) 
that went into commercial operation that September. Japan has 
exchanged memorandums for the joint operation of the satellite 
with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of 
the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA). In 
November 1992, data received from the satellite was initially 
supplied to researchers for AO verification. Talks are currently 
under way between MITI and the National Space Development Agency 
of Japan (NASDA) to make the data available to other customers. 
In the meantime, there are plans to launch advanced earth 
observation satellites (ADEOS-I and ADEOS-II) and a tropical 
rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) satellite. There is also a 
plan to participate in an international satellite launching 
program in which Japan will provide the sensing equipment for 
earth observation to be launched aboard a foreign-made 
satellite. To strengthen the efforts toward natural resource 
exploration and the observation of the natural environment to 
grasp the effects industrial activities have on the environment, 
MITI has been promoting the development of an optical sensor 
(OPS) and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to be launched by the 
JERS-1 satellite, the development of a 
greenhouse-effect-causing-gas sensor (IMG) to be launched by the 
ADEOS satellite, and the development of an advanced visible 
light/infrared radiation sensor (ASTER) to be launched by NASA's 
earth observation satellite (EOS-AM1). In addition, the ministry 
is promoting the development of a next-generation synthetic 
aperture radar (next-generation SAR) and a next-generation 
greenhouse effect-causing gas sensor (next-generation IMG). At 
the same time, the ministry is promoting the development of the 
technology for the processing, analysis and utilization of the 
data obtained from these satellites and sensors, and is 
improving the system for distributing this data. Efforts are 
also being made to construct a database of satellite observation 
data and to construct a database network. 
  1. Development of Earth Resource Exploration Satellite 
No 1 (JERS-1) JERS-1 is a satellite that was launched in 
February 1992 for natural resource exploration using remote 
sensing technology. The satellite was developed through joint 
cooperation between MITI and NASDA. MITI has overseen the 
development of the observation system, including the optical 
observation sensor and synthetic aperture radar. The actual 
development work has been commissioned to the Organization for 
the Development of Natural Resource Exploration Systems (JAROS). 
The development effort is now passing from the test operation 
stage to commercial operation. 
  The JERS-1 satellite, equipped with synthetic aperture 
radar, 
is capable of performing multi-dimensional observation and of 
conducting observation in short-wavelength infrared frequency 
bands. The satellite is superior to those launched by the United 
States and European countries, including LANDSAT and SPOT. 
JERS-1 has drawn high expectations from researchers around the 
world for its capabilities in natural resource exploration and 
earth environment monitoring. Efforts are currently being made 
by the Earth Resource Survey and Data Analysis Center (ERSDAC), 
an extragovernmental organization affiliated with MITI, and 
NASDA to improve the system to process, analyze and distribute 
the data obtained from the satellite. 
  The data from the satellite is being received through the 
cooperation of ground stations in the United States, Canada, 
Australia and Europe. By receiving data from a European earth 
resource survey satellite (EERS-1) for the ESA, Japan has 
entered into a mutual cooperation agreement regarding satellite 
data reception with those European countries. The European 
satellite was launched in July 1991. A memorandum was exchanged 
between ERSDAC and King Abdul Aziz City of Science and 
Technology (KACST) of Saudi Arabia for the joint reception of 
JERS-1 data and joint research between them. Research is 
currently under way. 
  With the operation of the JERS-1 satellite, this joint 
research is expected to produce useful results. 
  2. Development of Advanced Visible Light/Infrared 
Radiation Sensor (ASTER) 
  ASTER is an optical observation sensor that is being 
developed for a future launch aboard the JERS-1 satellite. A 
similar sensor is scheduled to be launched in 1998 aboard the 
U.S. satellite EOS-AM1 for earth observation. This satellite is 
being developed by NASA. ASTER is currently under development by 
JAROS, with the development commissioned to the establishment by 
MITI. This sensor is an advanced version of the observation 
sensor currently being used on the JERS-1 satellite. ASTER will 
make it possible to conduct observation in multi-band 
frequencies in the thermo-infrared frequency range for the first 
time ever. This sensor is expected to be used in diverse 
application fields, including natural resource exploration and 
earth environment observation. In the United States, too, the 
need to develop a sensor similar to ASTER has been voiced. The 
fact that ASTER has been picked by NASA for launching aboard the 
American satellite means that the Japanese sensor technology has 
reached international standards. Considering that the sensor 
will play an important role in the earth observation system 
(EOS) project being promoted by NASA with cooperation from 
Japan, Canada and European countries, the sensor has been 
drawing great international attention. This has prompted the 
formation of research teams not only in Japan, but also in the 
United States with assistance from NASA, for developing 
application fields for ASTER. MITI intends to promote the 
development of the application fields through cooperation with 
foreign researchers, including those from the United States and 
Europe. 
  3. Survey of Earth's Environment Using 
Satellite-Mounted Sensor (Wide-Area Environment Monitoring and 
Surveying) 
  In recent years, the deterioration of the earth's 
environment 
has grown into a major international issue. The prime target of 
the efforts to combat environmental pollution has been to 
restrain the levels of substances in the environment which are 
responsible for causing the so-called greenhouse effect. These 
substances include CO[.sup]2[/] and methane. It is not yet 
known in which part of the earth's environment these substances 
are concentrated and in what density. The effort to monitor and 
survey the earth's environment over a wide area will involve 
earth observation using a satellite-mounted sensor (IMG) that is 
capable of detecting these greenhouse effect-causing substances. 
The earth observation satellite ADEOS is scheduled to be 
launched by NASDA in 1995. The development of the sensor is 
being conducted by JAROS, the construction of the ground system 
for receiving IMG data is being conducted by ERSDAC, and the 
development of data analysis technology has been undertaken by 
the Central Research Institute of the Electric Power Industry. 
All of these projects have been commissioned to these 
establishments by MITI. The sensor is designed to measure the 
distribution of these substances in vertical and horizontal 
directions in the environment by detecting special types of 
light in infrared wavelength ranges which are emitted by these 
substances. This is the first time that an attempt to observe 
the earth's environment using this method has been made, and 
thus great attention is being paid by environmental specialists 
around the world. 
  4. Development of Utilization Technology in Field of 
Natural Resource Exploration 
  In the search for natural resources, including oil deposits, 
it is important to comprehend the geological structure of a 
particular region on the earth. The effort toward grasping the 
structure combines the surveying of the earth's surface features 
and boring. Until recent years, surveying was conducted by 
dispatching specialists to a designated region and having them 
conduct their tasks using exploration instruments. Recently, 
aerial exploration using aircraft has begun to be conducted to 
improve efficiency, enabling a larger area to be explored at one 
time. Exploration from a satellite in space makes it possible to 
cover an even greater area by scanning the earth's surface at 
regular intervals. This new method has raised expectations among 
those involved in such exploration. 
  MITI has been making an effort to make it possible to use 
the 
observation data obtained from LANDSAT and SPOT in the 
exploration of natural resources, including exploration for oil 
deposits. The development of the technology needed to promote 
this effort has been conducted by ERSDAC as part of a 
development task commissioned by MITI. So far, efforts have been 
made to verify the effectiveness of the remote sensing 
technology in exploring natural resource deposits by comparing 
the data obtained by these remote sensing satellites with the 
data obtained through ground exploration. In addition, the 
development of the technology to improve the data processing and 
analyzing techniques has been promoted to ensure the effective 
use of the data. The use of the remote-sensed data has already 
been started in the exploration of oil deposits and metal 
resources, as well as in the exploration of geothermal energy. 
The application field is expected to expand in the future with 
further progress in the R&amp;D of remote sensing technology. 
  In June 1992, JERS-1 began to be used for practical 
applications, and efforts are currently being made to adapt a 
data processing method for the satellite. At the same time, the 
development of the technology needed to process and analyze the 
data obtained from ASTER is under way in cooperation with the 
EOSDIS data processing and distribution system of the United 
States. ASTER will be put into commercial operation in 1998. 
  So far, Japan has lagged behind other 
technologically-advanced countries in developing the technology 
to use remote-sensed data. However, it is expected that the 
number of customers using the data will increase in the future 
as a result of the improvement of data utilization systems. 
Efforts to improve the system are currently under way in 
preparation for the reception of data from JERS-1 and ASTER. 
  5. Development of Data Utilization Technology in Field 
of Hydropower Development 
  In formulating a hydropower development plan, it is 
essential 
to grasp the available flow rate of water in a river. So far, 
data on flow rates has been obtained by measuring the flow rates 
at the measurement stations located along major rivers. Flow 
rate calculations have been conducted by taking the river 
surface area and other necessary elements into account. However, 
there are many rivers in which it has been difficult to grasp 
the flow rate due to a lack of measurement stations, as well as 
for other reasons. Under these circumstances, in 1991 MITI 
started to develop a method for calculating the flow rate in 
Japan's rivers using the data obtained from remote sensing 
satellites. 
<H3>  Promotion of Use of Microgravitational 
Experiment Environment </H3>
  A microgravitational environment prevents the convection 
resulting from the presence of temperature differences from 
occurring. Such an environment also prevents the separation of 
materials due to differences in the specific gravities of these 
materials. These advantages of a microgravitational environment 
are expected to offer a better environment for experimentation 
that will contribute to understanding physical phenomena better 
and to the development of new useful materials. To ensure the 
continued progress of space development, it is important to 
understand the effects on the human body of living in a 
microgravity environment for long periods of time. For the 
purpose of better understanding these effects, experiments 
within a microgravity environment must be stepped up in the 
future. Microgravity conditions lasting for a very short time, 
i.e., ranging from a few seconds to several minutes, can be 
created during free falls from high towers, during ballistic 
flights by airplanes, and by using a sounding rocket. However, 
the microgravity conditions created using these media are not 
sufficient for conducting experiments to develop new materials 
or for conducting experiments involving living creatures. This 
makes it essential for these experiments to be conducted in 
space. NASDA has conducted research aboard the space shuttle by 
seeking the cooperation of the United States. NASDA plans to 
conduct experiments aboard the space station projected for the 
future. In parallel with these efforts, MITI, in cooperation 
with other research organizations, has been promoting the 
development of an unmanned space experiment system (free flyer) 
and self-returning unmanned space experiment system. At the same 
time, the ministry is trying to make it easier for those 
involved in space research to use their free-fall tower facility. 
  The experiment conditions experienced under a microgravity 
differ greatly from the conditions encountered on the ground. In 
order to promote the development of space technology under 
microgravity, it is important to accumulate the sufficient basic 
data needed to conduct the experiments smoothly. With this 
understanding, MITI has been providing assistance to the Space 
Environment Utilization Research Corporation and other 
establishments engaged in the development of space technology. 
  1. Development of Free Flyer 
  In cooperation with the Education Ministry (Institute of 
Space and Astronautical Science) and the Science and Technology 
Agency (NASDA), MITI has been developing an unmanned free flyer 
for conducting earth observation and conducting experiments 
under microgravity conditions in space. The flyer is scheduled 
to be launched by the H-II rocket in early 1995. It will be 
recovered by the space shuttle that will be sent up to the 
flyer's orbit six months after the flyer's launch. During this 
period, various experiments will be conducted using the flyer, 
with the results of the experiments expected to make it possible 
for us to better use the microgravity space experiment 
environment. The space flyer will play an important role as a 
space experiment facility in preparation for the future 
construction of a space station. The experimental equipment to 
be installed on the flyer will have a modular design, which will 
make it easy to replace the equipment units and the specimens 
for reuse of the flyer. By employing the flyer for unmanned 
experiments, the experiment environment aboard the vehicle will 
be made free from the changes in gravity caused by crew 
movements. This will make it possible for the flyer to realize 
an experiment environment superior to that aboard the space 
station. Another advantage of the flyer is the availability of 
sufficient electric power to run the onboard instruments since 
it will be equipped with solar batteries. MITI plans to include 
experimental units involving three types of furnaces, i.e., a 
single heat-source furnace, a combination heat-source furnace 
and a focused-heat furnace, as an onboard experiment system to 
produce high-purity GaAs crystals. GaAs, as a composite 
semiconductor material, has a promising future for use in solar 
electric power generation. 
  The efforts to develop a free flyer are currently at the 
final stages of creating a flight model. 
  2. Development of Self-Returning Unmanned Space 
Experiment Vehicle 
  The free flyer will provide an ideal microgravity experiment 
environment. However, its disadvantages include inflexibility of 
operation since it must be recovered by launching a space 
shuttle, and safety requirements since the orbiting flyer must 
be pulled into the cargo bay of the space shuttle by the crew 
for recovery. Taking these disadvantages into consideration, 
MITI plans to develop a self-returning unmanned space experiment 
vehicle by seeking cooperation from the Education Ministry 
(Institute of Space and Astronautical Science) and the German 
government. With the self-returning vehicle, it will be possible 
for Japan to launch and recover the vehicle for reuse without 
requiring the help of other countries. The vehicle will provide 
a solution to the problems encountered in the unmanned free 
flyer. Considering the cloudy future of the space shuttle 
operation, it will be necessary for Japan to develop such a 
self-returning experiment vehicle. The disadvantages of the 
self-returning vehicle are the limited supply of electric power 
and the shorter experimental period during a single flight. 
  With the development of the self-returning vehicle, it will 
become possible to launch experimental equipment with a total 
weight of approximately 160 kg for conducting various 
experiments under microgravity conditions for about a week. 
Using the vehicle, it will also become possible to conduct 
experiments to produce catalysts with better performance and to 
evaluate the performance of carbon materials by exposing them to 
the heat generated by the vehicle's re-entry into the earth's 
atmosphere. Japan has yet to master the skills for recovering a 
flying object from orbit. Success in the recovery will 
contribute greatly to Japan's efforts in developing space 
technology. 
  3. Positive Use of Free-Fall Experiment Tower 
  A free-fall tower for realizing microgravity conditions on 
the ground, offering the greatest free-fall distance in the 
world and which was constructed at a former coal mine in 
Kamisunagawa Town on Japan's northernmost main island of 
Hokkaido, was first used for experiments in September 1991. 
Construction began in 1988, with the project undertaken by the 
Underground Weightless Experimentation Center, a consortium of 
the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO), local 
governments and private companies. A free-fall tower makes it 
possible for microgravity conditions to be realized repeatedly 
on the ground relatively easily. Such a facility has been very 
useful in conducting experiments in preparation for the 
full-scale experiments to be conducted in space. For this 
reason, free-fall towers are being used by space research 
centers in many countries, including Bremen University in 
Germany and NASA's (Louis) Research Center. 
  The Kamisunagawa free-fall tower has a free-fall distance of 
approximately 500 meters and can produce a microgravity of 
10[.sup]-4[/] lasting for 10 seconds. The availability of the 
tower is expected to greatly boost Japanese research on the use 
of the microgravity experiment environment. 
  Study is currently being conducted to promote joint space 
research using the Kamisunagawa facility. Regarding one such 
projected research project, MITI is considering conducting joint 
research with Germany and France to develop the technology for 
controlling furnace combustion under microgravity conditions, 
aimed at applying the technology to the development of a 
high-performance industrial furnace. As for another such 
research project, the ministry is considering conducting joint 
research with the United States to develop the technology for 
controlling fuel combustion under microgravity conditions for 
possible application to aircraft and space transport systems. 
  4. Activity of Space Technology Corporation 
  The Space Technology Corporation (STC) was founded in 1986 
to 
promote research and tests for creating and processing the 
crystals for producing composite semiconductors under 
microgravity conditions, and, consequently, to promote the 
development of an advanced electronic technology. STC, an R&amp;D 
company, is capitalized 70 percent by the Japan Key Technology 
Center, with the rest handled by private companies. The company 
has been conducting research under microgravity conditions by 
launching small TEXUS rockets produced in Germany. STC's 
research has focused on obtaining basic data that can only be 
obtained under microgravity conditions. In the research 
conducted by launching the small rockets, many useful data items 
have been obtained. In particular, a feat in which the thermal 
conductivity of InSb fluid was measured accurately drew 
international attention. It had been impossible to obtain such 
accurate thermal conductivity measurements on the ground due to 
thermal convection and other effects. Considering the fact that 
this kind of data is essential for growing the crystals used in 
producing composite semiconductors and for the processing of the 
crystals, systematic efforts must be made to accumulate such 
data. 
  When the space shuttle Columbia was launched in 1993, STC 
conducted experiments to develop new materials by participating 
in the D-2 program. (The D-2 program involved experiments 
conducted under microgravity conditions in the quarters aboard 
the space shuttle that had been hired by Germany.) The 
experiments conducted by STC involved obtaining the basic data 
that will become necessary when developing new semiconductor 
materials. The results of the experiments are expected to be 
published in autumn 1993. 
  STC is the first Japanese company established to develop the 
utilization of the microgravity environment of space. In this 
sense, STC must assume a leadership role in the effort to 
develop Japan's space industry. 
  5. Activities of Other Related Organizations in 
Promoting Use of Space Environment 
  The Japan Society for the Promotion of Machine Systems 
(JSPMS) has been developing small experiment systems to be used 
aboard the space shuttle by taking advantage of the microgravity 
conditions lasting six to seven minutes that were made available 
during the launching of the small Swedish MASER rockets and 
NASDA's small TR-IA rockets. In March 1989, with the cooperation 
of the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. (SJAC), 
JSPMS conducted experiments on molded oxide semiconductor 
materials and conducted on-the-spot observation of this 
material's crystallization process aboard these rockets. In 
April 1992, the JSPMS conducted a second series of experiments. 
JSPMS is scheduled to conduct experiments during the September 
1993 flight of a TR-IA rocket to unravel the mechanism of the 
fluid phenomenon accompanying the boundary phenomenon. 
  On the other hand, SJAC has been involved in conducting 
experiments to grow zeolite crystals aboard a German satellite, 
in addition to extending its cooperation to JSPMS in the 
experiments described above. 
  In May 1993, SJAC conducted experiments aboard the Russian 
space ship Mir in which they grew crystals of proteins. These 
experiments have been conducted under limited weightless 
conditions. However, MITI wants the publication of the results 
of these experiments to lead to recognition by the industries 
and researchers concerned of the importance of promoting the 
utilization of microgravity conditions. 
  In the meantime, the Japan Space Utilization Promotion 
Center 
(JSUP) has been actively introducing the results of research on 
the utilization of microgravity environments conducted in Japan 
and abroad, as well as research trends. 
<H3>  Promotion of the Development of Space Plane-Related 
Technology </H3>
  In order to promote space development, it is important to 
substantially cut the costs of ferrying men and equipment 
between the ground and space. To realize this, it is necessary 
to step up the development of a space plane (space shuttle) that 
can be used repeatedly. Current efforts are centered around the 
development of space shuttle-type transport systems launched by 
nonreusable rockets. A number of countries are currently 
developing space plane-type vehicles, including Hermes being 
developed by the European Space Agency and Home being developed 
by Japan. In the United States, the development of a completely 
reusable space plane that will take off and land just like an 
ordinary aircraft is already underway. 
  The most difficult part of developing the space plane is the 
development of the materials for use in the engines and fuselage 
that must withstand temperatures approaching 1,800ÎC. In 
preparation for the development of such materials, MITI has 
conducted a series of investigations of developments occurring 
between 1987 and 1990. In addition, MITI has promoted such 
development through the R&amp;D Project of Basic Technologies for 
Future Industries ("Next Generation Project") being undertaken 
by the government's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, 
and by promoting efforts through its program for the Improvement 
of R&amp;D Infrastructures being launched by the New Energy 
Development Organization (NEDO). 
  1. Development of Advanced Super-High 
Temperature-Withstanding Materials 
  The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology kicked off 
an 
eight-year project in 1989 to develop advanced super-high 
temperature-withstanding materials as part of the agency's 
endeavors in the Next Generation Project. The interdisciplinary 
project involves researchers from the agency's laboratories, the 
nation's universities, and private companies who are developing 
materials with super-high temperature-withstanding and good 
antioxidation capabilities suitable for use in constructing the 
space plane. The materials under development include Ti-Al and 
Nl-Al intermetallics, as well as composite materials reinforced 
with carbon or silicon carbide fibers. 
  This project has attracted considerable interest from 
foreign 
companies. So far, a number of foreign companies, including 
Rolls-Royce, have participated in the project by extending 
cooperation to the Research and Development Institute of Metals 
and Composites for Future Industries (RIMCOF), an organization 
representing the private sector that is responsible for 
promoting the project. 
  2. Activities of Japan Ultra-High Temperature Materials 
Research Center (JUTEM) 
  As part of the project of Improvement of R&amp;D 
Infrastructures, 
JUTEM was established to help NEDO with the development of 
super-high temperature-withstanding materials. The center is 
responsible for making the facilities needed to produce 
super-high temperature-withstanding materials and to evaluate 
the materials developed that are available to Japanese and 
foreign researchers. 
  The center has two regional centers--one in Ube City, 
Yamaguchi Prefecture, and the other in Tajimi City, Gifu 
Prefecture. The former is mainly equipped with production 
facilities, while the latter mainly holds evaluation facilities. 
The operation of these regional centers is being subsidized by 
local governments and the companies using the centers. A portion 
of the facilities at these centers became operational and 
available for R&amp;D use in April 1991. It is expected that 
these 
centers will serve as the nucleus of regional activities for the 
developing advanced technology industries. 
  The facilities installed at these centers have drawn 
considerable attention from foreign researchers. So far, many 
researchers from foreign countries have visited these centers. 
<H5>  Promotion of Development of Space Robot Technology </H5>
  The effort directed toward space development so far has 
relied mainly on manned space programs, including the Apollo 
space program and programs involving the use of the space 
shuttle and Mir spaceships. In order to promote space 
development further, it will be essential to develop space 
robots. The robots will make it possible to perform various 
hazardous space tasks for the astronauts, including satellite 
maintenance in orbit and constructing a large-scale space 
station at comparatively low cost. 
  In fact, it has been found that the space station program 
(preparation for it is under way, aiming at starting space 
station operation in the late 1990s) will involve vast amounts 
of construction and maintenance work that will be more than the 
astronauts can handle. This has caused the program to be 
completely reviewed. 
  The need for the introduction of space robots will become 
more important in the larger-scale space station programs needed 
in the future for the exploration of the moon and Mars. 
  In the meantime, Japan lags behind Canada in the development 
of space robot technology. (Canada developed the robot arms 
currently being operated from the space shuttle.) However, Japan 
has a reached the top level of industrial robot technology, and 
its potential ability in robotics has been highly evaluated 
internationally. In 1990, the United States and France each sent 
fact-finding missions to Japan to investigate the Japanese 
situation regarding the development of space robot technology. 
As described above, international cooperation in the field of 
space robot technology has begun to be promoted in recent years. 
  Under these circumstances, MITI plans to start research on 
space robot technology so that it can evaluate the fundamental 
technology needed to create space robots by taking advantage of 
the launch of technology evaluation satellite No 7 (EST-VII), 
scheduled to be launched by NASDA in 1997. 
  Joint research by Japan and the United States on a technique 
for mutual manipulation of a telerobot installed a very long 
distance away was scheduled to start in 1993. 
<H5>  Study of Electric Power Generation System in Space </H5>
  Amid the mounting concern in recent years about the 
deterioration of the earth's environment, the Japanese 
government has announced that it will make an effort to 
formulate a plan to save the earth from aggravating 
environmental pollution, that it will promote the transfer of 
environment-related technologies to developing countries, and 
that it will promote the development of new energy-related 
technologies that may prevent environmental pollution from 
causing further aggravation. The space electric power generation 
scheme involves generating electric power using solar energy, 
and transmitting the electric power thus generated to ground 
stations in the form of microwave energy. This energy generation 
system represents one of those new energy generation methods 
being studied for possible introduction in the future in our 
effort to save the earth from environmental destruction. In 
order to realize electric power generation from space, a number 
of problems must be resolved. These problems include the 
development of a technology for constructing a large-scale 
electric power generation system in space, grasping the effects 
on the earth's environment of using microwaves to send the 
electric power generated, and reducing the cost of constructing 
such a system. Technologically, however, a major hurdle has 
almost been cleared, and it is highly possible that electric 
power generation from space will be realized. Since 1991, MITI 
has been conducting surveys on space electric power generation 
system development in Japan and abroad, on the technological 
possibilities of constructing such systems, and on their 
economic viability. 
<H5>  Study of Launching Rockets on Commercial Basis </H5>
  As a result of the progress being made in recent years in 
the 
commercial utilization of communications and broadcasting 
satellites worldwide, rockets for placing these satellites in 
orbit are beginning to be launched on a commercial basis by 
Ariane Space Corporation and other companies. In the meantime, 
with the appearance of a company established to procure rockets 
and launch them for its customers, it will become possible to 
launch rockets on a commercial basis in Japan. The company was 
founded by setting sights on the launch of the H-II rocket that 
is under development by NASDA. 
  However, in order to make it possible to launch rockets on a 
commercial basis in Japan, a number of problems must first be 
solved. These problems include revising the space law with 
respect to clauses defining the responsibility of third parties, 
improving the rocket launch center utilization system, 
transferring rocket-related technologies currently held by 
governmental organizations, adjusting interests with fishermen, 
and developing the demand to ensure that rocket launching will 
continue on a commercial basis. 
  Since 1993, MITI has been making an effort to realize the 
launching of domestically-developed rockets on a commercial 
basis. 
<H3>  Survey of Situation of Development of Next-Generation 
Commercial Satellites and Their Utilization </H3>
  The need for developing next-generation commercial 
satellites 
has been mounting in recent years. For example, in the case of 
satellites for observing the earth's environment, disaster areas 
and conditions on the ground, the next-generation satellites 
will make it possible to establish more sophisticated earth 
observation systems that will allow observation to be realized 
at greater frequencies. However, many problems must still be 
solved before development can proceed. These problems include 
who will develop and operate the satellites, how the satellite 
services will be operated, and other problems expected to be 
encountered in promoting international cooperation in the 
development and utilization efforts. 
  In preparation for such development, MITI has been 
conducting 
surveys since 1991 on the situation in Japan and abroad with 
respect to the development of advanced commercial satellites, 
focusing on ones to be used in earth observation. Parallel to 
this, the ministry has been studying the measures it will 
introduce to promote the development and use of the satellites 
on a commercial basis. 
<H5>  Problems MITI Must Tackle To Promote Space Development </H5>
  So far, this report has introduced the current situation in 
the Japanese space industry that is experiencing a turning point 
in various respects, and the efforts MITI has been making to 
promote space development. There are still many problems that 
must be tackled in promoting the commercial utilization of space 
technology and international cooperation. 
  These problems include: 
  1. Improvement of the Industrial Infrastructure for 
Better Market Competitiveness 
  The space industry depends heavily on government subsidies. 
The Japanese space industry has not had sufficient 
commercial-base experiences in its activities. Taking these 
things into consideration, it is important for the industry to 
promote the use of parts and hardware systems in actual space 
applications, and to accumulate data on the results of actual 
use. Improvement must also be made in the production and test 
systems necessary to produce satellites and rockets. In 
addition, the industry must formulate a corporate strategy that 
will take international cooperation and the international 
division of space development tasks into account. 
  2. Promotion of Utilization of Space Technology 
  An urgent task involves developing a technology that will 
promote the use of the data obtained from the remote-sensing 
satellites in industrial applications, and reforming the 
administrative system to facilitate the commercial use of the 
data. It is important to promote experiments in microgravity 
conditions, including experiments using free-fall towers. 
Efforts must be made to develop the demand for ground-use as 
well as space-use equipment and systems. 
  3. Establishment of Framework for Commercial Use of 
Space 
  The industry must strengthen competitiveness in the 
international market. At the same time, the Japanese government 
must take measures to promote space development and the 
utilization of space technology in the private sector. Such 
measures would include the legislation of laws governing the 
commercial launching of rockets in compliance with the space 
treaty and ensuring the availability of rocket launch centers 
that can be used year-round.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  During the four years since the last Report on the Prospects 
of the Space Industry in Japan was published in 1988, the 
environment surrounding the international space industry has 
changed drastically with the great changes in the international 
situation, including the unification of the two Germanys and the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. With these changes, international 
efforts toward the development of space seem to be shifting from 
competition between the two superpowers of the United States and 
the former Soviet Union to joint efforts for the development of 
scientific technology for peaceful applications. The technology 
will be used for the preservation of the earth's environment and 
for other purposes that will benefit international society. 
These four years also witnessed the entry of the People's 
Republic of China into the international satellite launching 
business using their rockets. 
  By taking these changes into account, the Society of 
Japanese 
Aerospace Companies, Inc. (SJAC) has compiled a report on the 
Prospects of the Space Industry in Japan for FY92. The work of 
compiling the latest report was subsidized by the Japan 
Auto-Race Association, a special public organization. 
  The report summarizes the changes that have taken place in 
international society in connection with the endeavors in space 
development and the measures taken by the Japanese government to 
promote the domestic space industry. The report describes the 
current situation with respect to the development of rockets and 
other space transport systems, and the problems with promoting 
these endeavors. The report also refers to the importance of 
nurturing the space industry to promote space development, to 
the importance of expanding the market for the industry, and to 
the necessity of promoting international cooperation and 
contributions. Following is an outline of the latest report. 
<H5>  Environment Surrounding Japanese Space Industry </H5>
  1. Changes in International Situation 
  The international environment surrounding Japan has changed 
drastically in the last few years. Because of the need to 
promote the commercialization of space development by 
alleviating financial burdens, and because of the need to 
promote the development of space technology to enable better 
observation of the earth, e.g., for monitoring the earth's 
environment, the trend is toward promoting international 
cooperation and dividing the burden, with those countries able 
to afford it assuming a greater burden. 
  In the United States, the Clinton administration has placed 
top priority on the reconstruction of the domestic economy. As 
for his administration's space development policy, there are 
some analysts who expect that the emphasis will shift to 
smaller-scale scientific efforts, such as the development of 
earth environment-related technologies, by drastically cutting 
the budget for the construction of a permanent space base as 
well as a space station and for preparations for a journey to 
Mars. 
  In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the 
commercialization of space development efforts has progressed 
under the freer economic policy introduced by the new 
government. These days it is becoming a popular practice for 
other countries to access the space technologies accumulated by 
the former communist state through various means. The country's 
space policy and other space-related activities, including 
negotiations with foreign countries, is guided by the Russian 
Space Bureau, founded in 1992. The relationships between CIS and 
neighboring countries are still unstable. 
  In Europe, the budget for space development has been 
curtailed due to the economic recessions in the member countries 
of the European Space Agency (ESA). This has been aggravated by 
cuts in the monetary contributions to the ESA by unified 
Germany. Germany has been forced to cut contributions due to the 
deteriorating domestic economy, which was caused mainly by the 
merger of the two Germanys. Under the circumstances, European 
countries are reviewing their space development policies by 
placing greater emphasis on promoting international cooperation. 
  In other parts of the globe, civil war broke out over racial 
or territorial confrontations in a number of countries and 
regions after they had been freed from the restraints of the 
superpowers following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In 
the meantime, the Gulf War demonstrated the usefulness and 
effectiveness of space technology, as represented by the 
reconnaissance and communications satellites. 
  The Arche and Munich summits confirmed the importance of 
tackling the deterioration of the earth's environment and other 
global problems by promoting the use of earth observation and 
remote sensing technologies. The importance of environmental 
observation from space will continue to increase in the future. 
  2. Recent Developments in Japanese Space Industry 
  Sales in the Japanese space industry in 1991 stood at 
approximately &yen;294.5 billion, an increase of 9.2 percent 
over the preceding year. The number of people working in the 
industry and related industries was 11,060 as of the end of 
March 1992, a gain of 7.2 percent over the year before. 
  The major events and developments that have taken place in 
the space industry in recent years include: 
  (1) Agreement in the trade negotiations between Japan and 
the 
United States to settle the issues covered by the Super 301 
Article requires that Japan remove import barriers on satellites 
which the Japanese government or domestic organizations directly 
or indirectly under government supervision procure for purposes 
other than R&amp;D. This will expose the domestic space industry 
to 
greater international competition. 
  (2) With the success of the experiments conducted by the 
Japanese astronaut Mamoru Mori in September 1992 aboard an 
American space shuttle, the fundamental material creation 
experiment (FMPT) was completed. Experiments in a weightless 
environment were also conducted aboard the Russian spaceship Mir 
in January 1992 and by launching NASDA's small TR-IA rocket in 
August 1992. In 1991, the construction of the world's highest 
free-fall experimental tower was completed in Kamisunagawa Town 
on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido. 
  (3) Until recently, the demand for channels from 
broadcasting 
and communications satellites was brisk for several years. 
However, the demand for additional channels by communications 
satellite has declined sharply in recent years due to the 
economic recession. Private broadcasting companies, which are 
using the communications satellite, are losing money because of 
higher operating costs, including higher program production 
costs, and they are now trying to reconstruct their businesses. 
  (4) Tokyo and Washington concluded an agreement in 1989 
about 
mutual cooperation in the construction of a space station. 
However, a delay of the space station program seems inevitable 
due to the budgetary constraints in the United States in recent 
years. We must continue to monitor the developments regarding 
budgetary matters in the United States. 
  (5) In general, the commercial use of satellites will 
continue to expand in the coming years. The GPS navigation 
system for passenger car drivers is an example of such a service 
being offered using satellites. 
  3. Developments in Space Industries of Other 
Countries 
  The space development budgets in Japan, the United States 
and 
European ESA member countries in 1991 totaled &yen;2.5309 
trillion, a gain of 66.6 percent over 1988 when the last report 
was compiled. Of the total, Japan accounted for 7 percent and 
the United States for 77 percent. The following are the major 
events and developments that have taken place in the space 
industries of a number of foreign countries. 
  (1) Cooperation between the United States and Russia 
progressed in the field of space-related matters. In 1991 the 
two countries signed the START agreement. In 1992 they announced 
an agreement to launch a joint space program. In addition, they 
launched a joint business to be operated on a commercial basis. 
  (2) The Clinton administration, which came to power in 
January 1993, expressed its intention the following month to cut 
the space project budget substantially in an effort to 
reconstruct the domestic economy. 
  (3) Russia has been promoting the commercial utilization of 
space technology to reconstruct its deteriorating domestic 
economy. The People's Republic of China, armed with its Long 
March rockets, has entered the international satellite launching 
business. 
  (4) The ESA ministerial conference held in November 1992 
decided to put off some of its space programs, including the 
development of the Hermes space shuttle. Instead, the conference 
decided to promote an earth environment monitoring program and 
some other space endeavors in which it will be easier to produce 
tangible results. 
  (5) In October 1990, INTELSAT modified part of its agreement 
to promote liberalization of the international video data 
communications and VSAT service. 
  (6) Ariane Space Corporation has captured 60 percent of the 
international satellite launching business market in terms of 
the number of satellites scheduled for launching by offering low 
launching prices. The company has cut launch costs by mass 
producing rockets. Ariane Space is developing more powerful 
rockets. 
  (7) The formation of a larger company by merger has been a 
popular trend among European companies in recent years. 
  (8) The method of launching a satellite from a B-52 plane, 
which was employed by private companies in the United States in 
1990, is drawing attention as an economical way of launching 
satellites. 
  4. Current Situation in Japan's Space Industry 
  (1) The following is a list of the major space development 
projects being undertaken by the Japanese government: 
  (a) The Science and Technology Agency is developing 
technology testing satellites, systems for use in space 
experiments (space station experiment module JEM, etc.) and 
space transport systems (H-II rocket, etc.). 
  (b) The Education Ministry is promoting the development of a 
number of types of scientific satellites and the rockets to 
launch them. 
  (c) The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
is developing remote sensing satellites (earth resource 
exploration satellite No 1 (ERS-1), etc.), space environment 
utilization satellites (SFU, etc.) and some other types of 
satellites. 
  (d) The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is 
developing communications/broadcast technology satellites 
(COMETS) and tropic rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) satellites. 
  (e) The Transport Ministry is operating the geostationary 
meteorological observation satellite No 4 (GMS-4). 
  (f) The Environment Agency is developing various types of 
sensors for installation on earth environment observation 
satellites. 
  (2) The following are the major projects in which the 
Japanese government is involved that will promote the 
utilization of space: 
  (a) MITI is a member of D-2, promoting international 
contributions to space endeavors. 
  (b) The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is studying 
the construction of an Asia-Pacific satellite communications 
system as part of its international cooperation efforts. 
  (c) The Home Affairs Ministry has been promoting a plan to 
improve regional satellite communications networks since 1990. 
The plan is mainly being carried out by the Local Autonomy 
Satellite Communication Organization to improve the 
communications system for fire fighting, disaster prevention and 
administrative information. 
  (d) The National Police Agency is using CS-3 [communications 
satellite] service for obtaining image information regarding 
accidents and disasters. 
  (e) The National Land Agency is using satellites for 
disaster 
prevention communications and to obtain data on the utilization 
conditions of land using remote sensing technology. 
  (3) Financial Assistance 
  Private companies have been playing an increasingly 
important 
role in space development efforts. The government policy 
guidelines on space development recommend the introduction of 
financial and tax measures to promote space development by 
private companies. In line with this, financial assistance is 
being extended by the Japan Development Bank and other 
establishments. 
  Specifically, low interest loans are available for those 
companies investing money for the introduction of machines to 
produce, test, inspect and transport space-related equipment or 
systems. The loans are also available to encourage the 
construction of facilities for storing the hardware manufactured. 
  In addition, there is a tax relief system (high-tech tax 
system), under which a company which acquired equipment or 
machines for use in the research and development of key 
technology for space development, such as a psuedo-space 
environment test system, is entitled to a tax reduction. 
<H5>  Guidelines for Developing Space Industry </H5>
  1. Industrial Scale 
  The scale of the Japanese space industry is far smaller than 
that of the United States and some other countries. Further 
development of the Japanese space industry hinges on our efforts 
in the coming years. The following can be considered as factors 
hindering the expansion of the industry. 
  (1) The effort to expand the industry's activity calls for 
long-term collaboration among scientists and engineers 
specializing in many technological fields. Under the current 
circumstances in which the scale of the industry is small with 
few projects being undertaken, it is impossible for a single 
R&amp;D 
establishment to secure many able specialists on its own. 
  (2) The fact that space development in Japan is being led by 
the government and public establishments causes the demand from 
the private sector to be lacking. Even if an increase in demand 
from the private sector is seen, some uneasiness over the fact 
that the industry must continue to rely heavily on government 
assistance will remain. 
  The percentage of the budget for developing and launching 
satellites, both in Japan and abroad, is still low compared to 
that of the total space industry. In Japan, all satellites 
launched to date have been newly developed. In order to continue 
developing new satellites, it will be necessary for the domestic 
industry to keep many engineers for a long time. This will be 
impossible for the industry, which is still unable to get along 
on its own. To promote investment in R&amp;D resources, it is 
particularly important for the government to continue fostering 
the industry. It will also be important for Japan to participate 
more actively in the future in the programs being promoted by 
the consortiums of European and U.S. establishments. 
  In the meantime, of those satellites launched between 1990 
and 1993, 55 percent were launched by the United States, 26 
percent by European countries, and 9 percent by Japan. The 
average per annum launching costs worldwide are expected to 
reach $4.5 billion for the century. For Japan, the average is 
expected to stand at approximately &yen;50 billion at the most, 
even if unreserved efforts against the restraining factors, as 
described above, are exerted. This will make it even more 
critical for Japan to promote the international division of 
burdens encountered in launching satellites. 
  The space industry can produce demands for completely new 
goods and services among the related industries, such as the 
cases seen in the communications and broadcasting industries. 
For the communications and satellite broadcasting industries, in 
particular, the space industry has generated great economic 
benefits that have led to the growth of other related domestic 
industries. To promote the growth further, the communications 
and broadcasting industries must step up their efforts to that 
end. However, government assistance is also needed to nurture 
these and other related industries. 
  2. Space Industry as a Strategic Industry, and Budget 
for the Industry 
  One strategically important thing if Japan is going to 
promote the growth of the space industry in the coming years is 
how to promote international cooperation by maintaining 
flexibility in space endeavors. 
  The political environment in the world has changed greatly 
in 
recent years, as has the international space development 
environment in terms of mounting competition and the increasing 
need to promote international cooperation. Historically, space 
development has been promoted: (1) to secure international 
leadership, (2) to ensure security in the economic and defense 
fields, (3) to promote the development of services and 
technology, and (4) to deal with matters of global interest. 
Under these changing international situations surrounding the 
space industry, Japan must promote the formation of a more 
comprehensive national space policy that will not be confined to 
the development of science and technology. 
  In satellite development, the global interest factor assumes 
particular significance. As evidenced by the operation of WEDOS, 
it is important for Japan to use its money and technology to 
promote projects that will bring benefits to the world through 
environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, and other 
satellite services. 
  As for the development of space transport systems, it is 
important to go ahead with it flexibly to ensure continued 
progress in the development effort. The issues Japan must tackle 
in this effort include: (1) securing competitiveness in 
production costs, (2) keeping the technology up-to-date, and (3) 
establishing a new frame of international cooperation. 
  It is expected that the building of an infrastructure in the 
space industry will become the main target of Japan's space 
development efforts. Taking this into consideration, it will be 
important for Japan to define its intentions in promoting such 
development, to set goals, and to work out a long-term vision 
for development. 
  The government's budget for space development has recorded 
an 
annual increase of approximately 10 percent in the past few 
years. The expenditures for development must be increased to 
promote space development programs, including satellite 
launching for environmental monitoring. Japan lags far behind 
the United States and some European countries in terms of the 
amount of money allocated for space development. 
  3. Need for Development of Private-Sector Demand 
  Japan's space industry currently has very few demands from 
private companies. To promote the growth of the space industry, 
it is essential that the government expand the space program and 
introduce measures that will lead to an increase in the demand 
from private companies. These efforts will generate quality 
through mass production, improved reliability, and better 
customer service. These improvements, in turn, will lead to 
contact with a larger number of customers, which could help the 
space industry better understand the customers' needs and 
develop more demand--resulting in the strengthening of the 
industrial infrastructure. The development tasks that private 
companies can perform well should be commissioned to them. By so 
doing, more private-sector money will flow into the space 
industry. This will then make it possible for the government to 
channel more money to new space projects. 
  The privatization of the satellite communications business 
can be thought of as a method for expanding the demand generated 
by the private sector. However, taking into consideration the 
fact that the satellites that have been used by satellite 
business concerns have been imported from the United States, 
privatization has not benefited much from them. Rather, economic 
benefits have been extended to related industries. Since the 
increase in the number of customers will lead to the growth of 
the satellite market, the government should consider not only 
extending assistance to private concerns, but also to stimulate 
the private sector demand by, for example, the government itself 
acting as a major user. 
  The demand for space transport systems from the private 
sector in Japan is still very small, and little effort has been 
made to increase this demand. However, an organization designed 
to develop the private-sector market has been set up, and 
positive results are expected to be forthcoming in the near 
future. To increase the private-sector demand for space 
transport systems, it will be necessary to (1) develop a variety 
of low-cost rockets, (2) promote the transfer of space 
technology to the private sector and make it easier to use a 
rocket firing center by taking legislative measures, (3) create 
an environment which will enable low-cost rockets to be 
developed, (4) study the possibility of using rocket firing 
centers in foreign countries, and (5) expand the launch window. 
  Under the current situation in the space industry, tangible 
benefits will not be forthcoming by promoting the development of 
the space industry infrastructure. However, it is expected that 
indirect benefits will be brought about by promoting research on 
the instruments and other measurement/observation systems that 
will be used on satellites. 
  4. International Cooperation and Contributions 
  In order for Japan to contribute to international space 
endeavors, it is important for her to be equipped with the 
ability to participate actively in international projects by 
maintaining her subjectivity. As for international cooperation, 
Japan must promote the development of a key technology by 
focusing on a specific field. Japan can contribute to the 
international endeavor by generating useful results in this 
development effort. 
  In the fields of space science research and space 
development, international cooperation has been actively 
promoted in past years, and will continue to be promoted in the 
future. 
  The launching of satellites for environmental monitoring and 
disaster prevention will benefit, in particular, the peoples of 
the Asian and Pacific regions. In the meantime, the low-altitude 
satellite communications project to aid in the navigation of 
earth-surface transport systems is a vast, costly undertaking 
and, thus, will offer a good opportunity for Japanese private 
companies to participate in international cooperation. 
  If Japan is to be able to contribute to international space 
endeavors and to produce tangible results in international 
cooperation, it is vital that she have commercially-usable 
rockets. 
  In the effort to improve the space industry infrastructure, 
too, it is important for Japan to be able to present 
constructive proposals and extend support to 
technologically-developing countries. 
  For the time being, Japan must make an effort to equip 
itself 
with the ability required to actively participate in the 
international projects currently being promoted jointly by the 
United States, Russia and Europe in order to improve the space 
industry infrastructure. As for the on-going space station 
program, any shift in U.S. space development policy will affect 
Japan. In preparation for such a shift, it is important for 
Japan (1) to take the necessary precautionary measures to 
minimize the adverse effects of such a policy change on Japan's 
space program, (2) to determine the appropriate level of burden 
it can afford when the burden of promoting an international 
project is divided among the countries concerned, and (3) to 
secure separate operating funds. 
  In order to promote international cooperation, it is 
essential that Japan establish its own technology and clarify 
the R&amp;D resources it can offer, then expand the range of 
resources it can offer in all fields involving satellites, space 
transport systems and the space industry infrastructure. At the 
same time, it is also important to clarify its policy and the 
role it will be able to play in the internationalization of 
space development efforts. In addition, it is necessary to 
expand the market for the domestic space industry. 
  Japan must make an effort to contribute to the Asian-Pacific 
regions by making the ideas and technologies developed by Japan 
available to the peoples of these regions to help them in space 
development and the utilization of space technology. 
  At the same time, Japan must explore the possibility of 
accepting cooperation and contributions from foreign countries. 
  When a private company in Japan introduces a technology 
being 
developed by a foreign company, it will become necessary for the 
Japanese government to extend financial assistance or assistance 
in other forms to the development effort. 
  5. Removal of Development-Impeding Factors and 
Introduction of Development-Promoting Measures 
  The following are the principal factors believed to be 
hindering progress in the Japanese space industry: 
  (1) Research for space development has been confined to 
comparatively narrow scientific fields, such as space science. 
  (2) In fields in which the space industry can get along on 
its own, the industry has been exposed to tough competition from 
similar fields in existing industries. 
  (3) The fact that the government budget and contracting 
method employed by governmental organizations in procuring 
hardware has not been sufficient to cover the development risks 
involved when investing huge amounts of money has discouraged 
private companies from offering their R&amp;D resources to space 
development. 
  (4) The demand for satellites and rockets has been very 
small, making it impossible to use volume production to cut 
launch costs. 
  (5) The agreement reached in the Super 301 trade 
negotiations 
between Japan and the United States has resulted in exposing the 
domestic space industry to tougher international competition. 
  (6) The lack of rocket firing centers, the narrow launch 
window, and the insufficient conditions of the satellite 
tracking ground station network have limited the number of 
satellites and rockets launched. These limitations have impeded 
the development of the domestic market, particularly the 
private-sector market, for Japan's space industry. 
  In tackling these problems, the following measures can be 
considered: 
  (1) Promoting the space industry as a national strategy by 
linking it with Japan's international cooperation program. 
Encouraging the private sector to extend stronger support. 
  (2) Promoting the participation of private companies in 
international space operation-related consortiums to make them 
more competitive internationally. Promoting cost cutting through 
volume production and other means. 
  (3) Realizing an administrative system in which it is 
possible to meet changes in domestic as well as international 
situations promptly. The introduction of governmental measures, 
including financial assistance and tax breaks, to promote the 
commercialization of the space industry and private-sector 
demand. It is necessary to introduce a budgetary and contract 
system that will be appropriate for promoting long-term 
development projects. 
  (4) Making it possible for private companies to use the 
R&amp;D 
facilities held by governmental establishments at reasonable 
prices, just like in the United States and Europe. 
  (5) The serialized development of satellites, and promotion 
of medium- and long-term projects. In particular, the promotion 
of such development by having the bus instrument related to the 
mission instrument. 
  (6) Securing an international consensus prior to going ahead 
with an international project which will benefit the world 
through cooperative efforts. The prompt implementation of an 
international project. 
  (7) Facilitating satellite launching by using rocket firing 
centers abroad and by launching from aircraft. 
  (8) Cutting the production costs of rockets. 
  (9) Introducing measures designed to reduce the investment 
risks for private companies. 
  (10) The introduction of legislative measures to protect 
satellite launching concerns from financial liabilities 
resulting from launch-related accidents. 
  (11) Standardizing the instruments and machines used in the 
space industry. Improving and automating orbital maintenance 
services and introducing robots. 
  (12) Securing able manpower and training. Stepping up 
publicity for space industry activities to help secure 
researchers and engineers. 
<H5>  Epilogue </H5>
  These 12 measures must be introduced or taken by Japan in 
order to promote space development. 
  To ensure the continued progress of the Japanese space 
industry, it is important for the government and private 
companies to cooperate with each other in promoting their 
endeavors by introducing the necessary measures, including the 
promotion of international cooperation. 
  The author concludes this article by hoping that the 
proposals made in this report will lead to Japan's making 
greater contributions to benefit the world by promoting the 
development of science and space technology, and that this, in 
turn, will contribute to further progress being made in Japan's 
space industry.

  [Excerpt] 
<H5>  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., as Industry Leader </H5>
  The development and manufacturing of the large 
domestically-developed H-II rocket have been undertaken by a 
number of companies mainly located in Aichi and Gifu prefectures 
in western Japan. The ground combustion testing of the rocket 
engine was conducted successfully in June 1993. 
  Among these companies, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the 
largest in scale with respect to the development and 
manufacturing work undertaken and the number of personnel 
involved, has assumed the leadership role. In July 1989, 
Mitsubishi changed the names of its Ohe factory located in the 
coastal area of Nagoya City and its Komaki-Minami factory 
located next to the Nagoya airport and to the Nagoya Airport 
Space System Works. These name changes were designed so that 
these factories could engage in assembling Boeing 767 and 777 
aircraft and devote time to research on space-related technology 
and production work. At the same time, the Komaki-Kita factory 
was renamed Nagoya Guiding and Propulsion Works to serve as 
Mitsubishi's center for rocket engine testing and production. 
  So far, the factory has manufactured 24 rockets, i.e., seven 
N-I rockets, eight N-II rockets and nine H-I rockets. Recently 
the factory began producing the LE-7, i.e., the main engine for 
the H-II rocket. In August 1991, an accident involving an 
explosion of the fuel injection unit occurred at the factory 
during a pressure test, causing a delay in the launch of the 
H-II rocket. The final combustion test and engine operation 
check were under way in May 1993 at the Tanegashima Space Center. 
  As for the H-II rocket, the plan is for seven of them to be 
launched in the coming years. According to a Mitsubishi 
official, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, expecting to produce the 
H-II rocket at the rate of one or two a year, is beefing up 
manpower at the Nagoya Guided and Propulsion System Works. 
  In June 1989, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries set up a space 
station engineering team (JEMET) by recruiting approximately 40 
engineers from the company's Space Station Design Section. 
However, the team was disbanded at the end of March 1992. The 
detailed design of the space station is currently being promoted 
by a number of the companies involved in the space station 
project. 
  As for the project to develop the Japanese space shuttle 
HOPE 
being promoted by the National Space Development Agency of Japan 
(NASDA), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has been engaged in the 
development of the basic technology, such as that of high 
temperature-resistant ceramic tiles. The company has finished 
the construction of an experimental model of an orbit-to-earth 
re-entry vehicle (OREX) which is scheduled to be launched by the 
H-II rocket. 
  Nagoya Airport Space System Works has 4,600 employees, while 
Nagoya Guiding and Propulsion Works employs 2,200 workers. 
<H3>  Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.--Another Major Space 
Developer </H3>
  Kawasaki Heavy Industries is one of Japan's major aircraft 
manufacturing companies. The firm has accumulated technologies 
in space-related industrial fields. The products being 
manufactured by the company include parts for use in the H-II 
rocket. 
  The southern part of Gifu Prefecture, centering around 
Kakamigahara City, boasts about 70 companies, including the 
aerospace division of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which are 
engaged in space-related endeavors. In recent years, Kawasaki 
Heavy Industries has constructed new factories for producing 
aircraft and space-related equipment and machines near Nagoya 
port and on the coastal area of Ise Bay where an interchange of 
the Tomei-Meishin Highway No. 2 is scheduled to be built in the 
future. 
  In May 1992, Kawasaki Heavy Industries constructed the first 
such factory, with a floor space of approximately 70,000 square 
meters, in Yatomi Town, Aichi Prefecture, a region adjoining 
Nagoya City. In April 1993, the company built the second 
factory, with a floor space of approximately 18,000 square 
meters, on a plot of land along Ise Bay in Tobishima Village, 
Aichi Prefecture. The number of people working in space and 
aircraft production fields at these factories exceeds 4,000. 
  In the project to develop the Japanese space experiment 
module, JEM, which will be attached to the projected space 
station, Kawasaki Heavy Industries is responsible for developing 
a number of types of systems, including a system for removing 
carbon dioxide from the experiment quarters within the module. 
The R&amp;D resources at Kawasaki's Gifu Technology Research 
Center 
and the Space Technology Center have been improved to develop 
the advanced technologies needed to produce aerospace and 
defense systems. The company is also engaged in the development 
of astronaut training systems and robots designed to perform 
various tasks in space. 
  Other products Kawasaki Heavy Industries is developing 
include a fairing cover which, when installed on the tip of the 
H-II rocket, is designed to protect a satellite from the 
physical shock of the launch. 
  In the meantime, Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd., has a space 
industry division in its factory in Utsunomiya City in the 
central Japan prefecture of Tochigi. The company has been 
assembling wings for the B777 since early 1993 at its 
newly-constructed factory. The factory, with a floor space of 
approximately 49,000 square meters, is situated in Handa City on 
the Chita peninsula, Aichi Prefecture. 
  At the Utsunomiya factory, Fuji Heavy Industries is 
developing circuit breakers for use in the H-II rocket's engine. 
The breakers are being delivered to Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Fuji 
Heavy Industries is also producing test pieces of the tiles to 
be used to protect the surface of future space shuttles from 
heat. Officials at the Handa factory say that their company has 
no intention, for the time being, of starting the production of 
space-related equipment or machines in Aichi Prefecture. From 
the start, the establishment of Fuji Heavy Industries' 
facilities in the prefecture has been welcomed by the local 
community, which intends for Handa City to develop into a major 
industrial center for the space and aircraft industries. 
<H5>  Other Companies Operating in Aichi Prefecture </H5>
  There are many other companies which are operating in Aichi 
Prefecture. 
  Nippon Oils and Fats Co., Ltd., is manufacturing the solid 
fuel for the H-II rocket. The company's original establishment 
was in the Chita Peninsula area in 1919. The company's Taketoyo 
factory in Taketoyo Town, Aichi Prefecture, is currently 
delivering the solid fuel to Nissan Motors, which is in charge 
of procuring solid fuel for the H-II rocket. The factory is also 
producing the fuel for the booster-stage auxiliary rockets of 
the H-II rocket, scheduled to be launched in spring 1994, as 
well as the fuel used for separating the rocket's second and 
third stages. The ground test using similar fuel has been 
conducted successfully at the Tanegashima test range in 
Kagoshima Prefecture. The H-II rocket will carry two auxiliary 
rockets, each weighing 55 kg, which will be bonded to the 
booster. Officials at Nippon Oils' Aichi operation, to which the 
Taketoyo factory belongs, seem confident about the success of 
next spring's launch, saying, "We have also achieved great 
progress in bonding technology in recent years." 
  One company affiliated with Fuji Heavy Industries and 
operating in Aichi Prefecture is Yusoki Kogyo. Headquartered in 
Handa City, the company has actively invested in aircraft part 
production facilities, including automatic riveters, in recent 
years. According to Akira Soejima, president of the company, 
"Yusoki Kogyo will try to actively develop new fields of 
business, including space development, in the coming years." 
  The B777 marks the first time in the history of aircraft 
development that a three-dimensional CAD technique has been used 
to design an aircraft. In the effort to develop the aircraft, 
Computer Technology Integrator (CTI), a company headquartered in 
Nagoya City, has served as the data center. 
  The CAD network connects Boeing's headquarters in Seattle, 
five private Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries which is responsible for the assembly work, and Japan 
Aircraft Development Corp., headquartered in Otemachi, Tokyo, an 
establishment representing these Japanese concerns in the 
development effort, using exclusive communications lines. The 
three-dimensional data is filed into the database using IBM's 
general-purpose computers connected via the network. Referring 
to the possibility of using the data in the space industry, 
Takenari Wani, managing director of CTI, said, "For the data to 
be used in the industry, three-dimensional CAD software must be 
developed. However, it would not be difficult to develop such a 
program if sufficient time and money were available." 
<H3>  Efforts by Chubu Regional Bureau of International Trade and 
Industry and Chubu Business Community </H3>
  In the past several years, a move has been mounting among 
the 
business community in the Chubu region to actively promote the 
development of the space and aircraft manufacturing industry in 
the region to help develop the regional economy. In August 1993, 
the Chubu Council for the Promotion of Aerospace Technology 
(C-ASTEC), an organization composed of representatives from the 
Chubu business world, academia and the three Chubu region 
prefectural governments of Aichi, Gifu and Mie, as well as the 
Nagoya municipal government, and headed by Kamesaburo Matsunaga, 
chairman of the Chubu Economic Federation, was to be promoted to 
the status of a corporation. With the promotion, C-ASTEC could 
step up its efforts to invite state research establishments into 
Nagoya and the surrounding areas in an effort to form a major 
space industrial center in Japan. 
  This move was triggered by an idea included in the "Sophia 
Plan," a long-term industrial promotion plan with sights set on 
the 21st century, which was compiled and publicized by the Chubu 
Regional Bureau of International Trade and Industry (CRBITI) in 
June 1989. The plan envisaged the construction of a Chubu 
aerospace technology center equipped with a wind tunnel facility 
to make it possible to conduct the evaluations and experiments 
required to develop a supersonic transport (SST) and hypersonic 
transport (HST). In October 1989, C-ASTEC was organized with the 
intention of establishing an aerospace technology center in the 
Chubu region. 
  Following the above compilation, the plan for constructing 
the center was furthered with the establishment of the Committee 
for the Realization of the Idea (chairman: Shigeo Uchida, 
professor emeritus at Nagoya University). The results of the 
committee's study were announced in June 1990. The study 
results, entitled "Aerospace Technology for the 21st Century," 
were published by the Tsusho Sangyo Chosa-kai, an organization 
affiliated with MITI. 
<H5>  Aerospace Technology Plan </H5>
  The plan comprises projects to construct seven major 
facilities: (1) a large-scale testing and evaluation center, (2) 
a space technology development center, (3) an earth observation 
center, (4) a national aerospace research center, (5) an 
aerospace information center, (6) a flight experiment center and 
(7) a recreational arena of aircraft-space science and 
technology. 
  One problem encountered in promoting this plan is that it 
will be difficult to accommodate all these facilities within the 
Chubu region. In addition, the construction sites for these 
facilities have yet to be secured. With respect to this, 
Tadataka Kinoshita, head of the Secretariat, C-ASTEC, said, "The 
projects will be implemented by starting with the one that is 
the easiest to implement." As such a project, he singled out the 
large-scale testing and evaluation center which would involve 
the construction of a high-Reynold's number wind tunnel facility. 
  The facility will make it possible to simulate, on the 
ground, the flow of air around the fuselage when a plane is 
flying. In order to realize the conditions which a supersonic 
plane experiences during flight, the facility will be designed 
so that wind of a very high Reynold's number will be created by 
blowing liquid nitrogen into the tunnel at the highest-possible 
pressure to lower the temperature within the wind tunnel. The 
operation of such a wind tunnel facility will consume much 
electricity and natural gas, and will require a great volume of 
cooling water. The facility will produce much noise and, thus, 
sites where such a facility can be constructed are quite 
limited. The current candidate site for the building of the 
center is a 440-hectare reclaimed land plot located on the 
border of Aichi and Mie prefectures. The Kisozaki site faces Ise 
Bay. There is a plan to construct an interchange of the 
Tomei-Meishin Expressway No. 2 near the candidate site. One 
problem is that these two prefectures are contesting how to draw 
the border line on the reclaimed land. Arbitration efforts by 
the Home Affairs Ministry and the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries, the ministries which promoted the 
reclamation project, are currently under way, aiming at 
resolving the dispute by the end of 1993. 
<H5>  Agreeable Distribution of Space-Related Industrial Facilities </H5>
  Active efforts are being made by people across Japan to 
invite space-related industrial facilities into their regions. 
In September 1985, Hokkaido established a regional council to 
promote a plan for improving the facilities required for the 
construction of rocket launching and space plane takeoff-landing 
bases. A similar council was then set up in the Tohoku region in 
September 1989, with a Kyushu council organized by the 
Kyushu-Yamaguchi Economic Federation in December of the same 
year. A Kagoshima council has been active since July 1987, 
inviting more space-related industrial establishments into 
southern Kyushu Prefecture, in addition to the Tanegashima Space 
Center. 
  Under the mounting attention being directed toward the space 
industry, which is expected to grow into a major industry in the 
21st century, the Chubu Economic Federation played an important 
role in inviting the high-Reynold's number wind tunnel facility 
into the Chubu region. In July 1992, the federation proposed an 
idea for dividing Japan into several segments, with each 
engaging in different types of space development endeavors. 
According to the proposal, the capital sphere where the Tsukuba 
Space Center is located is to be devoted to research on basic 
technology, the Tohoku district where the Kakuta Rocket 
Development Center is situated (Miyagi Prefecture) should be 
devoted to the development of rocket engines, Kyushu should 
continue to specialize in rocket launching and control, as well 
as satellite tracking, and the Chubu district would engage in 
development and production using large R&amp;D facilities. The 
proposal is aimed at preventing many space-related facilities 
from being concentrated in a limited number of regions by 
ensuring the effective utilization of existing facilities. The 
proposal also takes the regional factors of the districts 
concerned into account. 
  The Chubu district is active in its efforts to have as many 
of the new space-related facilities built there as possible. In 
April 1990, the Nagoya Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
dispatched a mission to France to inspect the space-related 
industrial facilities located there. The mission toured Toulouse 
City, where the major facilities of the French National Space 
Development Center (CNES) are located, and other towns having 
space-related facilities. In September 1992, another mission was 
dispatched to the United States to inspect NASA's Marshall Space 
Flight Center in Alabama. Takashi Morita, head of the Nagoya 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Industry Section, points out 
the importance of concentrating not only the facilities for 
developing production technology, but also the facilities for 
researching software. According to Morita, "We should make an 
effort to have Nagoya and the surrounding areas develop 
industrially, with aerospace technology serving as the nucleus 
of the development effort." 
<H5>  Growing Activities of Space-Related Establishments </H5>
  Numerous space-related companies and research established 
are 
concentrated in the Chubu region. It is urgent that a network be 
established to connect these R&amp;D establishments. 
  On 29 May 1993, the construction of a free-fall experiment 
facility for creating a weightless experiment environment for 
the Microgravity Laboratory of Japan (MGLAB) was started in Toki 
City, Gifu Prefecture. The 150-meter free fall tower is being 
constructed using an abandoned mine shaft. When completed, the 
facility will be able to produce an approximately 
4.5-second-long weightless environment within a falling capsule. 
It will be used to develop new industrial materials. 
  In May 1991, the construction of a material research center 
at which materials can be tested at super-high temperatures was 
completed in Tajimi City, Gifu Prefecture. Material testing and 
evaluation is currently being conducted under simulated space 
plane flight conditions using the facility. 
  Tokyo University's Cosmic Ray Laboratory's Kamioka 
underground observation station has been used to observe the 
supernova explosions and to explore black holes by trapping 
neutrinos, i.e., particles that are far smaller than atoms. The 
technology for creating a virtual reality (VR) environment could 
be used in the space industry in the future. Having received the 
government's permission to construct a VR technology center in 
Kakamigahara City, Gifu Prefecture, preparations are under way 
for the completion of research center construction, scheduled 
for 1995. 
  The Japan Fine Ceramics Center in Atsuta Ward, Nagoya City, 
headed by Masaaki Ohashi, president of Aichi Steel Works, Ltd., 
secured MITI's permission [to engage in research] in May 1985. 
In 1993, the center started research on a "higher 
order-structure-controlled and fusion-produced inorganic 
material," a "flexible" ceramic that can be used at 1,350ÎC 
and has the ability to repair itself. This ceramic is a 
promising material for future use in the space industry. 
  In March 1991, the Artificial Intelligence Research 
Promotion 
Foundation, headed by Kunio Senda, chairman of Toho Gas Co., 
Ltd., was established to extend financial assistance mainly for 
research in artificial intelligence, an element vital in 
computer and space industry applications. 
  A behind-the-scenes effort is afoot to expand the 
Aeronautical Department of Nagoya University's Faculty of 
Engineering to the Aerospace Department. 
  C-ASTEC is purchasing technological information from the 
National Technology Information Service (NTIS), an organization 
attached to the U.S. State Department, in the form of microfilm 
sheets. So far, 70,000 items of information have been 
accumulated by C-ASTEC, one of the largest Japanese databases 
specializing in aerospace technology. The information in the 
database is offered to researchers and research organizations 
free of charge. 
  C-ASTEC will be required to play a larger role in promoting 
the creation of an information communication network, linking 
private companies, R&amp;D establishments and universities, and 
in 
promoting the development of a space industry which, in turn, 
will lead to the development of the local economy. 
<H3>  Spin-Offs 
of Space Technology </H3>
  The domestic space industry is still far smaller in scale 
than the auto industry--approximately one-fiftieth the size. 
Despite this, space technology has already been used in a number 
of daily life businesses, just as in the case of the United 
States where many of the space technologies developed by NASA 
are being used by private companies. The players in the effort 
to develop space technology are the state and a handful of 
private companies, with the general public ignored with respect 
to endeavors in space development. Under these circumstances, it 
would be appreciated if these space developers were to pay a 
little more attention to translating the technology they develop 
into the production of consumer goods. After all, it is the 
"consumer" who pays the taxes that are used to fund space 
development efforts. This effort to divert space technology to 
consumer industrial applications could lead to the generation of 
more space-related industries in Japan. 
  For example, the system introduced by Meika, a vegetable and 
fruit wholesaler headquartered in Hozan Town, Aichi Prefecture, 
to control the ropiness of imported bananas was developed and 
manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd., by taking a hint from the space 
exploration technology developed by NASA. The system makes it 
possible to tell the best time to eat bananas that, under 
Japan's Food Control Law, must be imported when green. The 
technology involved in this system combines a computer with 
light spectrum analysis. The NASA-developed advanced technology 
is being used for mineral resource exploration in space. 
<H5>  Romance of Space </H5>
  The Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc., is 
considering creating an aerospace industry museum--one that can 
be regarded as a Japanese version of the Smithsonian in the 
United States. As for the Chubu region, a theme park, i.e., Blue 
Sky Park, which will exhibit the short takeoff and landing 
(STOL) plane Asuka and display articles introducing the progress 
made in space development, will be completed in Kakamigahara 
City, Gifu Prefecture, in summer 1995. A 1.33-meter 5.8-kg 
rocket, Satsuki No. 1, which was successfully launched by the 
Kakamigahara branch of the Japanese Association of Space-Loving 
Children at an international rocket launching competition in 
France in 1992, will be exhibited and preserved in the park. The 
competition marked the 1992 observation of International Space 
Year. 
  Haneda Airport in Tokyo is the most likely candidate as the 
site for the aerospace industry museum. However, officials at 
the Kakamigahara municipal office in charge of promoting the 
Blue Sky Park project are being aggressive by saying, "During 
the second phase of our project, we intend to launch a drive to 
have the museum located in our city." 
  The era in which we live makes it possible for us to hear 
voices directly from the astronauts aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavor or Columbia. 
  Approximately 2,000 people attending a talk show held in 
Gifu 
City in April 1993 to which Japan's first astronaut, Mamoru 
Mori, had been invited were enthralled by the experiences he 
recounted, using slides in giving his explanation, with respect 
to conducting experiments in space. Entitled "A Journey to Space 
and Talk with Mori," the program was sponsored jointly by the 
Gifu prefectural government and the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper 
company. Earlier, in December 1992, Mori attended an 
international aerospace symposium in Nagoya City sponsored by 
the Chubu Aerospace Industrial Technology Promotion Institute. 
Mori's descriptions of his space experiences at these gatherings 
made people perceive space-related matters as being more 
familiar and intimate. 
  The experiments conducted aboard the Endeavor included an 
experiment on space sickness employing a carp. The experiment 
was proposed by Shigeo Mori, assistant professor at the 
Environmental Medicine Research Institute, Nagoya University. 
The carp was raised in Yatomi Town, Aichi Prefecture, and the 
selection of a carp raised in the town made the local mass media 
highlight the news throughout the Endeavor mission. A carp from 
the same town will be used in the next flight of the space 
shuttle Columbia, scheduled to be launched in July 1994. Female 
astronaut Chiaki Mukai will board the space shuttle as the 
second Japanese to fly in space. With the Yatomi Goldfish 
Fishery Cooperative supplying carp for the second time, the 
cooperative will feel that it has joined the ranks of 
space-related industries in Japan. 
<H3>  Administration of Space Development and Regional, as Well as 
Corporate, Efforts To Propagate Information </H3>
  As already described in this article, many space-related 
companies and other establishments are concentrated in the Chubu 
region. However, the region's ability to transmit space-related 
industrial information to the capital sphere and other areas 
across Japan is still poor. As part of the sixth phase of an 
airport construction project, boring is being conducted in the 
sea off the Chita Peninsula in Aichi Prefecture in preparation 
for the construction of the New Chubu International Airport. 
However, it is regrettable that more urgency is being placed on 
the construction of a third airport in the capital sphere than 
on the construction of the new Chubu airport. 
  Taichi Sakaiya, economic critic, in a speech at a meeting of 
the new airport research society held in Nagoya and sponsored by 
the Mitsui group of companies, made an interesting observation 
on the differences in the interest of the mass media in 
reporting on the new Kansai airport. In January 1986, Sakaiya 
counted the number of news items concerning the projected Kansai 
airport that were carried in Japan's five major dailies. The 
Osaka editions of these papers carried a total of 64 news items 
concerning the airport, the Nagoya editions ran a total of 17 
news items, and the Fukuoka editions published 13 items. 
However, the Tokyo editions carried news on the airport only one 
time, and this was done by the YOMIURI SHIMBUN, according to 
Sakaiya. This may have resulted from the fact that the head 
offices of these dailies are located in Tokyo. However, more 
than that, this indicates the difficulty of transmitting from a 
region that is far away from the capital. 
  To promote the effective propagation of information from the 
Chubu region, it will be necessary to resort to the inclusion of 
something that appeals to a wider segment of the population, 
such as mobilizing the Kin-san and Gin-san sisters [centenarian 
twins turned celebrities]. In order to have the Chubu region 
recognized as the center of the space industry in Japan, it will 
be necessary to internationalize the space development effort by 
opening the region more widely to the world, i.e., not confining 
the players to local companies and other local establishments. 
Inviting researchers and engineers from abroad will be one 
measure that must be taken for internationalization. The term 
"space" conjures up something romantic in people's minds. This 
something romantic must not be oppressed by "a regional egoism," 
since the Japanese sometimes tend to resort to such practices. 
  There are some who believe that the aerospace industry has 
something to do with the defense industry. This is partly 
because the aerospace industry is less familiar to the general 
public than are other domestic industries, since the former has 
contributed less to the growth of the local economy. Another 
reason for this is the failure of the private companies involved 
in space development to publicize their activities and the 
results of such activities that are able to be cited. With the 
Cold War now over, it is expected that the demand for space 
technology from consumer industries will begin to increase. This 
will make it important for these companies to better publicize 
their efforts toward peaceful applications of space technology. 
  As for the high-Reynold's number wind tunnel facility, it 
has 
been reported that the Science and Technology Agency's National 
Aerospace Laboratory in Tokyo's Mitaka area and the Defense 
Agency are separately studying the construction of similar wind 
tunnel facilities. It would not be wise for the government to 
construct such costly high-Reynold's number facilities 
separately by the two related government agencies. The United 
States and the EC are currently the only countries in the world 
that have high-Reynold's number wind tunnels. 
  Shigeo Uchida, professor emeritus at Nagoya University and a 
specialist in aerospace engineering, emphasized the importance 
of promoting the construction of the wind tunnel as a national 
project. "Now it has become more important to promote 
international cooperation in space development. We intend to 
promote international cooperation as early on as the stage of 
rocket development, not confining such cooperation to research 
purposes. To promote this, the high-Reynold's number wind tunnel 
must be constructed in Japan as soon as possible," he said. 
  Space has almost infinite possibilities. To realize our 
dreams in space it is necessary (1) for the business world, in 
its efforts to promote space development, to avoid being 
preoccupied with practicing regional egoism, (2) for private 
companies to try to publicize the information they have as much 
as possible so that the information can be used to promote the 
application of space technology in nonmilitary fields, and (3) 
for the government to nurture the space industry by playing the 
positive role of a "space agency."

  [Text] Islamabad (MASHRIQ Panel): Federal Minister of the 
Interior Nasirullah Babar has announced that, after the court 
proceedings relating to the [drug] dealers on the wanted list, 
have been completed in Pakistan, these individuals would be 
handed over to the U.S.. In an interview with the MASHRIQ panel 
held in the interior minister's office in Islamabad, the 
minister said that the government was determined to establish 
the supremacy of the law at any cost. He said that the "big 
fish" of the drug dealing business, who were facing legal 
charges in the U. S. or other countries, would first have to 
complete all legal procedures in Pakistani courts, and, if found 
guilty as charged, these individuals would then be handed over 
to face court trials in other countries. He said that Pakistan 
had bilateral agreements with other countries under which 
Pakistan would have to extradite to these countries individuals 
who had committed crimes there. He said that the present 
government had no intention of shirking its international 
responsibilities. In answer to a question regarding Murtaza 
Bhutto, the minister of the interior said that under the policy 
of ensuring that the law was implemented, any individual charged 
with a crime, whether the individual was Murtaza Bhutto or Altaf 
Hussain, would receive the same treatment under the law. He said 
that the sentences pronounced against Murtaza Bhutto by the 
military courts in his absence became null and void under a 
former, general amnesty declared by the People's Party. The 
minister added that certain charges against Murtaza Bhjutto, 
including the PIA [Pakistan International Airlines] hijacking 
and the Shah Bandar case, were still pending, and that Murtaza 
Bhutto would be given every opportunity to clear himself in a 
court of law. The minister said that all Pakistanis residing in 
foreign countries, including MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] leader 
Altaf Hussain, would be free to return to Pakistan, but those 
who were facing criminal charges would not be able to escape 
legal proceedings. In answer to a question regarding the 
increased smuggling of foreign products into Pakistan, the 
minister agreed that no Pakistani government so far had 
succeeded in stopping this pernicious practice. He said that, in 
view of the fact that markets in smuggled goods existed all over 
the country and thousands of individuals depended on them for 
their livlihood, it would not be practicable to shut down this 
activity entirely. He said that he had proposed that, after the 
payment of customs duties on foreign goods at the sale centers, 
these goods should be allowed free passage. In this way the 
checkpoints set up on the GT road, which subjected Pakistanis to 
humiliating searches and resulted in illegal goods being left 
behind [not clear; or allowed to go free?] could be abolished. 
In answer to a question regarding the unrestricted entry of 
foreigners into Pakistan and the presence of foreign spies 
pretending to be sailors, Babar criticized the actions of past 
governments, which he said had adopted a generous policy of 
issuing visas for free travel between Pakistan and India and 
which had ended the restriction on obtaining a confirmation from 
the police before granting visas. The minister said that, 
whereas in the past hardly eight or ten visas daily were granted 
to individuals wishing to come to Pakistan from India, the [new] 
policy had given rise to the undesirable practice of granting up 
to 800 visas daily. The minister said that the present 
government had reviewed the policy, and it was hoped that the 
situation would gradually return to normal.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "American Minister's Visit to Pakistan"] </F>
  [Text] Ms. Robin Raphael, the U. S. assistant secretary for 
South Asian affairs, has arrived in Pakistan to start 
negotiations with Pakistani government officials and political 
leaders. On her arrival in Pakistan on Sunday, she met with the 
acting President Mr. Wasim Sajjad, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto, and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif. Ms. Raphael's 
meeting with Benazir Bhutto is considered very important, and U. 
S. Ambassador John Minjo and Pakistani Foreign Secretary 
Sheharyar Khan were also present at the meeting. It was learned 
that these talks began with discussion of India-Pakistan 
relations and the Kashmir problem. The United States had assured 
that it would support efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue in 
the United Nations. Ms. Raphael said that the Kashmir issue 
would be resolved according to the UN resolutions. The United 
States had advised that the nuclear programs in South Asian 
countries be frozen, rolled back, and then destroyed. It was 
assured that no pressure would be put on any country 
unilaterally to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. If 
what Ms. Raphael has said represents the Clinton 
administration's policy, then we should understand that U. S. 
policy on Pakistan is changing. 
  Pakistan and America have very old relations, and Pakistan 
still desires good relations. However, we cannot deny that it 
was the United States that brought about the coolness in the 
bilateral relations. It has always tried to take advantage of 
Pakistan's friendships through some agreements, and has never 
considered Pakistan's needs and interests. It is especially true 
when we had problems with India, and during trying times, the 
United States not only left Pakistan alone, but also took steps 
to benefit India. 
  In the context of the nuclear program, the U. S. policy 
seems 
to want to make India a powerful country in this region. Under 
the Pressler Amendment, military and economic aid to Pakistan 
has remained suspended. A few months ago, the United States 
threatened that it would declare Pakistan a terrorist nation 
just to please India. Therefore, believing that the United 
States has changed its policy over Kashmir's nuclear program and 
other issues could be premature. Since the United States itself 
is responsible for the tension and cool relations between the 
two countries, it should take the initiative in improving this 
relationship, and must provide facts to support its intentions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Robin Raphael's Visit and Pakistan's Principled </F>
Stand"] 
  [Text] The specific situation under which Ms. Robin 
Raphael, the U. S. assistant secretary for South Asian affairs, 
has visited Pakistan include such important points as political 
and economic restrictions, the sensitive situation of the 
Kashmir issue, Pakistan's role in it, nuclear policy, and 
China's supply of missiles to Pakistan. All of these were 
included to give the impression that newly elected government 
under the leadership of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto will be 
able to take care of this pressure. It was also hinted that the 
present tension between the United States and Pakistan may not 
end. By the end of the U. S. assistant secretary's trip, and 
until her last speech, many incidents surfaced; however, Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto demonstrated a high level of political 
savvy and did not compromise our national interests and policies 
in any agreements. Instead, she presented the interests of the 
people of Pakistan in a better light. One proof of this is the 
request to review the Pressler Amendment and reinstate economic 
and military aid to Pakistan. 
  It is a fact that the United States has always considered 
Kashmir a contested issue. However, in the present situation, 
the way it has mentioned it openly and has hinted about 
negotiations between India and Pakistan, as well as hinting to 
Pakistan that it review its peaceful nuclear program, the United 
States will not only resolve the Kashmir issue, but will also 
create a positive atmosphere for reinstating economic and 
military aid. The United States will also give political support 
at the international level. In this context, the United States 
has declared the presence of nuclear weapons in this region a 
danger to world peace. It was also announced that if Pakistan 
stopped its nuclear program, the United States would then also 
pressure India to do so. The fact is that this strategy is being 
used just to make Pakistan stop its peaceful nuclear program, 
because India is not willing to review its nuclear program at 
all. It has not accepted any restrictions or expressed any 
willingness to sign an international pact. The whole world knows 
that India's nuclear power is far ahead of Pakistan's peaceful 
atomic program. India is working continuously for its military 
use, and it also has a large number of atomic bombs. In 
contrast, Pakistan wants to use its program just to alleviate 
its energy problem. However, international propaganda is against 
it. A specific international lobby is propagating that 
Pakistan's program is for military goals, even though the 
Pakistani government has denied it repeatedly. It has declared 
its intention to participate in any agreement for establishing 
peace in the subcontinent in which India is also involved. In 
this context, Pakistan has also hinted at its willingness to 
sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]; however, India has 
opposed such an agreement because of its malicious designs. It 
does not support any plan that could result in peace in this 
region. 
  The recent visit by the U. S. assistant secretary was part 
of 
the effort to pressure Pakistan again; however, Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto refused to accept any pressure in this context. 
She instead welcomed any concrete efforts to stop nuclear 
proliferation in south Asia. This was also reflected in the U. 
S. assistant secretary's statement, in which she clearly said, 
"Pakistan has presented its stand about its national security, 
which will not change until India changes its attitude." 
  The Pakistan People's Party's [PPP] president and Pakistan's 
prime minister have always taken a principled stand, according 
to patriotic feelings. The U. S. assistant secretary expressed 
her feelings in her statement. However, it is unfortunate that 
our opposition leader, who, until yesterday, talked about a 
third option for Kashmir, hinted about rolling back the nuclear 
program, and has opposed the idea of negotiations with India, is 
talking about starting a "campaign" over the Kashmir issue and 
the nuclear program. This is a character flaw, and the people 
see and understand everything. A decision about it will be made 
in the people's court in the future. The fact is that the PPP 
and its leader, Madam Benazir Bhutto, have never made a decision 
that has been detrimental to national security, and they never 
will.

<F P=106> [News Report: "Uzbekistan Revokes Lenient Visa Policy"] </F>
  [Text] Karachi (Staff Reporter) -- The former Soviet Union 
republic and Central Asian country of Uzbekistan have abandoned 
its lenient policies to issue visas to Pakistanis. According to 
informed sources, the Central Asian countries have formed a 
policy of control for issuing visas to foreigners. This policy 
has several aspects. Some of these steps were taken to prevent 
the Central Asian republics from influence of foreign political 
ideologies and political instability. In addition, because of 
fear of the spread of epidemics such as cholera, the visas are 
being issued following strict criteria. The sources revealed 
that because of the strict rules about issuing visas, the number 
of tourists visiting Central Asian republics has decreased 
significantly. The number of passengers on the two weekly PIA 
[Pakistan International Airlines] flights from Islamabad has 
decreased considerably. PIA sources have expressed concerns that 
if Uzbekistan does not adopt liberal policies for issuing visas, 
then there is the possibility of reduction of the present two 
flights to one flight a week. The sources said that at present, 
PIA officials are trying to get support for issuing visas to 
Tashkent for their passengers, so that Islamabad-Tashkent 
traffic is maintained. The sources revealed that PIA is starting 
a new route from Islamabad to Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan's capital, 
via Tashkent on 20 November. The necessary arrangements are 
being made.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Cold Attitude Toward Close Allies?"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Aasif Ahmed Ali, soon after 
taking over his office, called a press conference and said that 
relations with China, Iran, and the Gulf countries are becoming 
cooler, and that India is making a place for itself among 
Pakistan's friendly nations. At the same time, he promised to 
improve foreign policy. He also made it clear, however, that no 
basic changes would be made in it. 
  India has been working very hard and diligently during the 
last two and one-half years to improve its relationship with 
China. It not only resolved many of its border disputes with 
China, but also improved relations by exchanging visits by the 
leaders of both countries. The situation is not like it was in 
the past; both countries have become quite warm to each other. 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao recently visited Iran and not only 
discussed political affairs with the leaders there, but also 
signed an agreement to increase trade between Iran and India. An 
almost similar situation exists with the Gulf countries. India 
is making room for itself in these countries by offering 
thousands of workers at very low wages. Pakistan has very close 
and friendly relations with China, and China will never 
establish a close relationship with India at the cost of its 
relationship with Pakistan, because it knows well that the 
United States and its allies are preparing India to confront it. 
Pakistan has similar relations with Iran and the Gulf countries. 
It also has a religious and cultural relationship with these 
countries, which have a centuries-old tradition. India, by 
increasing trade with these countries, is trying to weaken their 
relations with Pakistan. In the present era, the importance of 
economic relations cannot be ignored. In our beloved country, 
because of political instability over the last few years, we did 
not pay much attention to our relations with other countries. We 
should expect that the present government should not only 
eliminate the reasons behind this coolness in our relations, but 
also make efforts to strengthen Pakistan's relations with these 
countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Nuclear Program--Need for Caution"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan 
will not roll back its nuclear program unilaterally at any cost. 
Pakistan's nuclear program has been suspended since July 1990; 
however, as to the question of it being rolled back, Pakistan 
will not do so unilaterally. We have told our American friends 
not to punish us under the Pressler Amendment, because this will 
not help limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This issue 
cannot be resolved when India learns that only Pakistan will be 
punished, and that it will not. The United States should 
understand that the present attitude toward Pakistan is extreme 
in nature, that it must be changed, and that it is not meeting 
its goal of stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons this 
way. 
  Our differences with the United States over Pakistan's 
nuclear program are very old. During Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's 
time, the United States had opposed when Pakistan had signed an 
agreement with France to purchase a nuclear reprocessing plant. 
Then U. S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger threatened 
Pakistan that if it did not abandon its nuclear program, "it 
would be punished in such a way that it would be a lesson to all 
other countries." Mr. Bhutto's supporters say that he took a 
great risk and continued the program, and that he was dismissed 
and later hanged as punishment. General Ziaul Haq continued this 
program; however, because of the Afghanistan situation, the 
United States did not object. When the Afghanistan war was over, 
the United States intensified its objections again, and, 
finally, in October 1990 it stopped all military and economic 
aid to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment. At present, 
Pakistan is trying to explain to the United States of America 
that the unilateral implementation of the Pressler Amendment is 
not helping it achieve its goal of stopping the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons in South Asia, and that it should review this 
legislation again. Many informed American experts have also 
admitted that the Pressler Amendment has not helped in the 
attainment of the goals it was supposed to reach, and that there 
is no use in retaining it. However, the U. S. government has not 
agreed to review this legislation. 
  Since the establishment of Benazir Bhutto's government, she 
has tried to convince the United States that its policy on 
nuclear weapons in South Asia is incorrect. Ms. Robin Raphael, 
assistant secretary for South Asian affairs, has also been 
informed of Pakistan's position on it. Madam Bhutto has 
explained Pakistan's stand again. As the prime minister has 
said, Pakistan has proposed different strategies to limit the 
spread of nuclear weapons in South Asia. Because of a lack of 
cooperation from India, however, none of these could be 
implemented. If the United States really wants to stop the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Asia, then, instead of 
putting pressure on Pakistan only, it should pressure both 
countries equally. Its present policy is resulting in an 
increased nuclear race in this region. It should realize the 
importance of Pakistan's positive and proper stand, and should 
be willing to review its decision to stop aid to Pakistan. 
  Mian Nawaz Sharif, leader of the opposition, has said that 
Madam Bhutto froze the nuclear program in July 1990, and has 
admitted that it was frozen during her administration. Thus, she 
had proven herself to be an enemy of her own country. The 
inference that Mr. Sharif has made from Madam Bhutto's statement 
is a very strong and unreasonable one. However, Madam Bhutto 
should also clarify her statement; if the program was frozen in 
July 1990, then who ordered it? Was this decision made with her 
knowledge, while she was the prime minister? Similarly, Mr. 
Sharif should also make it clear why, during his 30-month prime 
ministership, he did not try to correct this decision, and why 
he did not reactivate that program. It is said that, during Mr. 
Sharif's rule, the Senate chairman, during his trip to the 
United States of America, assured the American authorities that 
Pakistan's nuclear program was frozen and had been stopped where 
it was. If this information is correct, then it should also be 
explained. We request that both leaders, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto and opposition leader Mr. Sharif, to stop issuing 
statements about Pakistan's nuclear program just to hurt each 
other's position. It would be wise not to make this issue a 
political football. This program is related to our national 
defense, and political motives should not be given priority over 
our national interests.

Sarhad"] 
  [Text] Peshawar (MASHRIQ Correspondent) -- According to 
informed sources, the minister of internal affairs has started 
action against the illegal aliens from Egypt, Algeria, Syria, 
and Tunisia who are living in Pakistan. The sources revealed 
that the hundreds of families from these four countries that are 
living in Peshawar have been instructed to leave by 26 November. 
If they remain, action will be taken against them. Most of these 
people came here in connection with the Afghanistan jihad. The 
sources revealed that the government has instructed them to 
obtain a visa in Pakistan before 26 November and go to any 
country they wish to. It is believed that, if these people are 
sent directly to their country of origin, they will be arrested 
on arrival there. After the Home Ministry's decision, the Arab 
residents of Peshawar were in a tumult because of their fear of 
being arrested. Meanwhile, the citizens of these four countries 
and their leaders met with the officials of the Home Ministry, 
and they were told that the citizens of these countries, who are 
legally working in government offices, are exempt from this 
operation.

<F P=106> [Article by Zahid Hanif: "Why Is the U.S. Worried Over </F>
Pakistan's Defense Preparations?"] 
  [Text] Pakistan has been independent for 46 years now. 
Pakistan was not discovered by a Columbus; it was established 
after two million Muslims had sacrificed their lives. They left 
their ancestral homes, sacrificed their forefathers' memories, 
and left their graves just to attain the goal of establishing 
Pakistan. They irrigated Pakistan with their blood. However, 
reading or hearing about the U.S. attitude gives the impression 
that Pakistan was leased to us for 50 years only and this lease 
is about to expire. The United States appears to be watching 
Pakistan all the time. What are all these pranks about `do not 
do this' or `do not do that'? The United States sometimes 
imposes economic restrictions on us and other times stops the 
sale of F-16 planes to block our defense program. Is not 
Pakistan an independent nation? Does not this nation have its 
borders? Do not humans live here? Our neighbor India waged 
surprise wars on us three times. Cannot we make preparations to 
defend ourselves from a country five times bigger than us? India 
has openly blasted a nuclear bomb in 1974, and even today it is 
making weapons round the clock in its four ordinance factories 
to burn Pakistan; however, the United States cannot see this 
all. Instead, it is ready to declare Pakistan a terrorist nation. 
  Whenever the United States provided aid to Pakistan, it took 
full advantage of it. It used Pakistani shoulders and Afghani 
guns to destroy the superpower that was the Soviet Union. The 
Soviet Union was a country with expansionist designs. It wanted 
to destroy Afghanistan to reach warm water ports and the oil 
wells in the Gulf. At the same time, it could have become equal 
to the United States in Asia. It could have aimed at New York 
and Washington easily from here. Even today, the United States 
is very interested in Siachen and China, and the protection of 
its interests are behind these efforts. It can keep a close eye 
on the Central Asian (Muslim) nations and on China from here. 
The whole world is aware of the U.S. dichotomous policies. If it 
is sympathetic to humanity, then it should put out the fires in 
Bosnia. It should punish Hindu imperialism for its ugly crimes 
against humanity just like it attacked Iraq. When Pakistan was 
helping it stop the progress of its greatest enemy, the Soviet 
Union, the United States viewed Pakistan as a principled nation. 
Now that we are trying to stop the progress of our enemy, it is 
looking at us suspiciously and calling us a terrorist nation. 
  However, thank Allah, Pakistan was able to survive without 
U.S. help in the past and will continue to survive proudly 
without it until the end of the world. A new problem has started 
now. They [the U.S. Government] say that drugs are smuggled from 
Pakistan to the United States. According to it, 156 important 
Pakistani people are involved in this trade. It is asking for 
their extradition as criminals. Pakistan is an independent and 
respectable nation. It also has courts and jails, as well as a 
justice system. Therefore, we can try people right here. 
  Now the question is who is protecting this ugly and 
abominable trade? In which countries is heroin manufactured? How 
is it smuggled into an alert country like the United States? 
  The truth is that every country in the world has its own 
jails. It proves that every country has its share of rotten 
eggs. Pakistan also has some people like that. New York is 
considered top most on the list of cities in the world with a 
high rate of crime. The latest example is the loss of hundreds 
of thousands of dollars worth of equipment by a deputation led 
by Philippines President Fidel Ramos during its five-day trip to 
the United States. A television camera worth $74,000 belonging 
to the state television network was stolen in a motel lobby. 
Later a large bag containing the guests' wireless equipment and 
batteries for the cameras also disappeared. It was not the fault 
of the United States, and we are not blaming it because these 
vile acts were committed by some criminals. Similarly, Pakistan 
has some stupid and poor people. They open suitcases full of 
dollars and are dazed. They dream about becoming rich overnight, 
and join this ugly trade. This epidemic is hurting our nation. 
How can we like this trade? The government arrested hundreds and 
sentenced them to be flailed. The Americans, however, come here 
and tempt them again to become involved in this trade. The 
Government of Pakistan is fully focused on this problem, 
therefore, the United States need not worry about it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "the U.S. and the Kashmir Issue" </F>
  [Text] The 170-member Human Rights Committee of the U. S. 
Congress has asked Foreign Secretary Warren Christopher to play 
an effective role in finding a peaceful resolution to the 
Kashmir crisis. A letter this group sent to the secretary of 
state stated that there was great concern about human rights 
violations by the Indian armed forces and militant groups. They 
have concluded that the Indian Army is committing atrocities 
against the Kashmiri people according to an organized plan. 
Therefore, the Indian government should be asked to explain the 
situation, and should take to task the people involved in 
violating human rights. 
  The situation surrounding the Indian government's violations 
of human rights has become so serious that even the United 
States has been forced to take notice. However, in order to be 
"fair," the U. S. Congress has also accused Pakistan of 
supplying weapons to the "terrorists." The fact is that Kashmiri 
freedom fighters are not terrorists, and Pakistan is not 
supplying them with any weapons. Pakistan is giving moral 
support to these freedom fighters; however, talks about 
providing them with weapons are totally wrong. This accusation 
is coming from India. If the members of the U. S. Congress pay 
attention to India's violations of human rights, they would not 
spoil the issue by declaring the freedom fighters terrorists. 
Nor should they recognize the Indian accusation of Pakistan 
supplying the weapons in order to try to lighten India's weight 
of crime. The Kashmiri freedom fighters are struggling to free 
their country from the Indian tyrants, and they have the support 
of the whole free world including Pakistan. 
  Since Pakistan is an important partner in the Kashmir issue, 
it has a moral responsibility to help the Kashmiris. It seems 
that the United States does not want a just solution to the 
Kashmir issue. Instead, it has some secret plans about Kashmir. 
Under this plan it is trying to involve China in this matter. An 
important State Department official has announced that the area 
given to China under the Pakistan-China border agreement was 
part of Jammu-Kashmir. The United States is making this issue 
even more complicated, and it could even hurt Indian interests. 
Therefore, India should start meaningful talks with Pakistan 
over Kashmir in order to keep international powers out of the 
subcontinent. If an American military base is established in 
Kashmir, it will prove a headache to India also.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A U.S. Foreign Minister' in Pakistani Cabinet"] </F>
  [Excerpt] A precious jewel, Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali of the 
Muslim League Junejo Groups, has been appointed the foreign 
minister. This is Madam Benazir's first major blunder, and, if 
she does not rectify it soon, she will not have to wait long to 
suffer from its horrible results. Dozens of other ministers were 
appointed. However, no appointment was objected to in such a way 
as Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's appointment. 
  This precious jewel was a minister in former Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif's cabinet. It was his misdeeds and slanderous 
activities that made Nawaz Sharif lose his seat of power. Mr. 
Nawaz Sharif gave him full freedom to make statements, and 
religious circles were greatly agitated because of his absurd 
talks. Mr. Nawaz Sharif demonstrated deplorable laziness and 
evasiveness in understanding the reality behind it. His sole 
remark in the cabinet was enough to show which lobby had 
nourished this plant. He had taken the oath to be faithful to 
Pakistan and its constitution which recognizes the Koran as the 
source of laws. However, he took pot shots at the decision on 
the interest system, based on the Koran and supported by the 
religious court. He did not hesitate from making harsh and 
aggressive statements against religious scholars, and Mr. Nawaz 
Sharif remained quiet about his attitude. This was the time when 
confrontation between Mr. Nawaz Sharif and religious leaders had 
first started. However, Nawaz Sharif did not even sense Asif 
Ahmed Ali's perversion. Meanwhile, his precious jewel gave 
Pakistan the ugly label of terrorist nation. Nawaz Sharif woke 
up when the whole nation objected to Ali's actions. However, the 
water had risen above his head by that time, and, despite Nawaz 
Sharif's issuing a warrant for his arrest and his voluntary 
resignation from the cabinet, Nawaz Sharif could not make it 
good and lost his bid for power. 
  Begum Benazir Bhutto was aware of this whole background, but 
included Asif Ahmed Ali in her cabinet under Junejo's Group's 
pressure. The pressure was not just from the Junejo Group; it 
also came from Washington. We can understand Begum Benazir's 
helplessness against this pressure and her appointment of a 
notorious person like Asif Ahmed Ali to her cabinet. This is an 
open act of blackmail in front of our eyes, and she claims that 
she would not be blackmailed by anyone. [As the poet said] Who 
would not fall in love with such simplicity! 
  Begum Benazir's helplessness is her own; however, the nation 
is not in the same position. Soon after this appointment, a 
Muslim League spokesman reacted with a statement condemning 
Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's appointment by the PPP [Pakistan 
People's Party]. The fact that this minister had jeopardized 
Pakistan's safety and security last April is known to everyone. 
The person who was actively trying to have Pakistan declared a 
terrorist nation should not be involved in the government at 
all, and, giving him such an important position as that of 
foreign minister, is out of the question. We have got the hint 
as to the kind of foreign policy Benazir's government wants. We 
can assume that its foreign policy will be based on efforts to 
make India happy, to end our nuclear program, and to adopt an 
apologizing attitude about Pakistan's Islamic character. This 
was Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's mission, and this will now be the 
PPP mission which he will follow as the foreign minister. 
  General Senator Hafiz Hussein Ahmed, secretary general of 
the 
Islami Jamhoori Muhaz, was surprised that Begum Benazir has 
appointed a person foreign minister, who a few months ago was 
trying to accuse his own country of being involved in terrorism. 
In his opinion, such an irresponsible person should not be 
appointed to such a responsible position. His becoming the 
minister will mean he will finish what he had started to do 
(Daily NAWA-I-WAQT 17 November 1993). 
  Maulana Alrouf, president of Jamiat-i Ittehad-i Ulema of 
Karachi, said in reaction to Sardar Asif's speech that he had 
played an important role in the fall of the former government 
and has distanced the religious groups from Nawaz Sharif. That 
is why the religious groups were against the Muslim League 
during the 1993 elections and the PPP had benefitted from it. 
Now the PPP's appointment of such a person, who issued an 
antireligious statement against condemnation of the interest 
system, who had insulted the religious leaders, and who was 
involved in a conspiracy to declare our country a terrorist 
nation, is equivalent to inviting Allah's wrath on us. If this 
man is not removed from the cabinet, the apprehension felt by 
the religious circles will not be removed (Daily JASARAT Karachi 
19 Nov 93). 
  These reactions indicate that Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's 
appointment has sowed the seeds of confrontation between 
religious groups, the opposition, and the Benazir government. It 
is a proven fact that no Pakistani government has been 
successful after alienating the religious groups. Therefore, we 
had said in the beginning of this article that the appointment 
of Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali to the foreign ministry was Benazir's 
first blunder, and, if she does not rectify this mistake, she 
will not have to wait long to suffer consequences . 
  The new foreign minister announced the day after his 
appointment that he was going to end Pakistan's isolation at the 
international level. Someone should ask this foolish person when 
was Pakistan alone? During Nawaz Sharif's era, Pakistan led the 
Group-77 nations. Last year Pakistan become a member of the 
Security Council with the international vote in its support. In 
addition to the Security Council, Pakistan was appointed a 
member to another important UN agency, the Social and Economic 
Council. These honors were received with the support of majority 
of the countries in the world. How does it indicate that 
Pakistan was alone? The truth is that his eyes are masked by 
U.S. interests. He sees Pakistan alone in the whole world just 
because the United States has stopped aid to it for the last two 
years. Nawaz Sharif received huge amounts of aid from Japan and 
Korea after the United States stopped its aid, and Pakistan 
started such large projects as motorways to prove that it did 
not care for U.S. aid and could make do without it. The success 
Pakistan had in building planes and missiles without U.S. help 
has worried the United States about losing an important customer 
for its defense and economic markets. Therefore, it is not 
Pakistan that is alone; it is the United States. Asif Ali is 
trying to get the United States, and not Pakistan, out of this 
economic isolation. He will work in the Pakistani cabinet as the 
American foreign minister. The whole nation objects to his 
speech.

<F P=106> [Article Jebul Rehman: "U.S. Demanding To Inspect Pakistani </F>
Nuclear Installations"] 
  [Text] The Sikhs leaders of the Azad Khalistan [Sikh state] 
campaign threw in the towel after fighting for about 10 years. 
During their unsuccessful campaign, thousands of young Sikhs 
were killed by the Indian Army, the Border Security force, and 
the police. Most of those killed were young people who lived 
near the Indo-Pakistani border. These young men were killed 
because it was suspected that they had or could have some kind 
of relationship with Pakistan. During this campaign, the Indian 
Army had to raid the holy shrine of the Golden Temple because 
the terrorist Sikhs had made this place of worship the center of 
their activities. The decision to raid the Golden Temple was 
definitely a very difficult decision for the New Delhi 
government. It required a lot of courage, which they had. The 
Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi became a prey of the Sikhs' 
revenge. However, the Sikhs had to pay a very heavy price for 
this vindicative action. Thousands of Sikhs were killed by the 
Hindus in New Delhi and other large cities. The Sikh terrorists 
started a rampage of killing when the campaign for the Azad 
Khalistan appeared to be dying. This series of actions gave a 
very bad name to the Sikh movement. The negative reaction to the 
killing of innocent women and children further weakened this 
campaign. The number of Sikhs who became tired and began to 
oppose this campaign increased gradually. The terrorists were 
forced to leave their areas of operation and the state. The Azad 
Khalistan campaign died when they dispersed. The Indian 
Government has also accused Pakistan of helping these separatist 
elements. At one time, the United States had warned Pakistan 
that if it did not stop helping the fighters in East Pakistan 
and Kashmir then it would be included on the list of nations 
that sponsor terrorism. General Ziaul Haq doubtlessly 
sympathized with the Khalistan campaign. He felt that the 
establishment of Azad Khalistan would encourage separatist 
movements in other Indian states and would weaken India. This 
would then ensure Pakistan's safety and security. Additionally, 
the establishment of Azad Khalistan would also help resolve the 
Jammu-Kashmir problem according to Pakistan's wishes. General 
Ziaul Haq's plan was based on sincere desires; however, it was 
not very practical. Had India felt a need to start a war with 
Pakistan in order to crush the Azad Khalistan campaign, it would 
not have avoided it. Moscow, Washington, and New Delhi were 
equally relieved at General Ziaul Haq's death in the airplane 
accident in Bahawalpur. Moscow and Washington were relieved 
because General Ziaul Haq was thinking about establishing a 
government according to his own desires in Afghanistan, being 
called the conqueror of Afghanistan,' and becoming a Caliph in 
this region against their wishes. The former Soviet Union and 
the United States did not like Ziaul Haq's plans; they were 
afraid of his designs. President Zia's death also satisfied New 
Delhi because he was considered a zealous and sincere supporter 
of the Azad Khalistan movement. U.S. pressure increased after 
President Zia's death and the Azad Khalistan campaigners were 
gradually disappointed. This movement became totally weak in the 
end, and the accusation that Pakistan was helping the Sikhs was 
also taken back to an extent. U.S. government spokesmen have 
admitted that the help being given to the freedom fighters 
across the Control Line has also been curtailed considerably or 
is almost nominal. The fact is that Pakistan and India have made 
such arrangements on the Control Line that entry of armed 
persons into Kashmir is extremely difficult if not impossible. 
Caravans of refugees from occupied Kashmir are coming into Azad 
Kashmir. This has been made possible because India wants this 
course of exodus to continue. No movement for independence can 
survive long without the resources needed. The Afghans were able 
to fight the U.S. war in the name of their jihad against the 
former Soviet Union for eight years because large scale 
assistance from the United States and its allies via Pakistan 
was filtered in to them continuously. Modern American weapons 
were supplied to the Afghans in huge quantities. Money was spent 
like water and food was provided regularly. The former Soviet 
Union was forced to retreat from Afghanistan, not only because 
the Afghan war proved to be too expensive for Moscow, but 
because it was spending much beyond its means on its space war 
(Star War) program in order to keep up with the United States. 
The Soviet Union went bankrupt because of the combined demands 
of the space war technology and the Afghanistan war. 
  The Kashmir freedom fighters have been confronting the 
Indian 
Armed Forces for more than three years. Their courage is 
commendable and their sacrifices should be venerated. However, 
when they do not receive any help from abroad and the number of 
Indian soldiers fighting them continues to increase, it would 
not be fair to expect these freedom fighters to continue their 
struggle for a long time. Fifty-five Kashmiri had gathered in 
the Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar and Indian soldiers had 
surrounded them. They could not endure this siege for more than 
one month. There were 12 freedom fighters among these 55 
persons, and they had all kinds of weapons. Had they broken the 
siege to face the Indian troops, all of them would have been 
killed, and the armed freedom fighters would also have been 
accused of killing innocent citizens. The besieged people in 
Hazratbal decided to surrender and the Indian government 
released the unarmed Kashmiris. Prudence dictated that the armed 
freedom fighters who had surrendered should not be treated 
inhumanly. The Indian record on human rights violations is very 
bad. Even the United States and Europe have started to criticize 
India about it. Pakistan is not mollified by the condemnation of 
India over human rights. It is worried about increased loss of 
life among the freedom fighters. It is clear from the news that 
the repeated strikes in trade centers in Srinagar and other 
places in the valley have caused scarcity of food and medicine. 
Even more distressing is the news about fighting between the 
pro-Pakistani group and those who want an independent Kashmir. 
The elements who want an independent Kashmir are trying to put 
pressure on those who want Kashmir to join Pakistan. No 
thoughtful Pakistani would criticize the Pakistani Government 
for not providing assistance to the freedom fighters. It would 
be difficult to provide reinforcement with weapons even when 
Pakistan is willing to do that. India has taken effective 
measures to close almost all routes. If Pakistan decides to 
cross the Control Line to help the freedom fighters, it would 
definitely lead to a war with India and Pakistan would be blamed 
for it. The United States will join the accusers and Pakistan 
will be severely punished for starting a war. Pakistan will not 
be able to bear the burden if the United States and India decide 
to punish Pakistan for helping the Kashmiris. In light of the 
imposing presence of the United States and its allies' air and 
naval forces in the Gulf after the war against Iraq, we can 
expect the United States to use its full force against Pakistan 
if it is necessary. 
  Although Pakistan has frozen its nuclear program, and, 
according to opposition leader Nawaz Sharif's claim, the present 
government has also rolled the program back, the United States 
and Japan are still not satisfied. The way Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto had repudiated Nawaz Sharif's claim has also 
complicated the issue. A few days ago, when it was confirmed 
that Pakistan's nuclear program has been frozen, there was also 
the good news that the countries helping Pakistan were going to 
provide it about $3.5 billion in aid. However, the United States 
officially announced on 19 November 1993 that all USAID offices 
in Pakistan will be closed by the end of 1995. Mr. Brian Edward, 
the chief of USAID has openly announced that the USAID offices 
in Pakistan are being closed as a punishment for Pakistan's 
nuclear program. Mr. S. Katajima, who heads the agency that 
decides Japanese government's policy on economic and technical 
aid, visited Islamabad last week. After talks with top level 
representative of Pakistani government, he said at a news 
conference that the Japanese government is concerned about 
Pakistan's nuclear program. He also mentioned that Japan will 
provide economic and technical aid to Pakistan only on condition 
that it stop plans to build weapons and missiles for mass 
destruction, reduce its defense budget, adopt policies to spread 
peace, increase plans to reduce environmental pollution, 
stabilize the democratic process, and continue to implement the 
economic policies started by Dr. Mayeen Qureshi. The U.S. and 
Japanese attitude shows that freezing our nuclear program is not 
considered enough for reinstating aid to Pakistan. Instead, we 
are being asked to do much more. I have written in this column 
that the United States has requested that Pakistan's roll back 
its nuclear program to a level where it is incapable of making 
nuclear weapons, and, in the third and the last phase, the 
program that represents our nuclear preparations should be 
totally disintegrated. The United States wants to do all this 
not only because it fears that Pakistani nuclear weapons can be 
used against India, but also because other Islamic countries 
might get this technology and these weapons could be used 
against Israel. In this context, Libya was mentioned in the 
beginning, and now they are mentioning Iran. Pakistan has 
repeatedly assured them that in spite of the availability of 
technical knowledge, it has no desire to make nuclear weapons. 
However, they do not believe Pakistan's assurance because the 
impression that Pakistan has a nuclear bomb was widely 
circulated during Ziaul Haq's time. In this context, it is 
important to mention that a senior Indian journalist visiting 
Pakistan met with Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan. Dr. Khan stressed 
during this visit that Pakistan had made an atomic bomb. It is 
said that the visit of the Indian journalist with Dr. Qadeer 
Khan was arranged at President Ziaul Haq's instruction, and Dr. 
Khan had said things as advised by President Haq. After this 
alleged admission by Dr. Qadeer Khan, the CIA made a secret 
documentary film about the Kahuta laboratories using spy planes. 
The CIA director showed this film to President Ziaul Haq in the 
While House during his visit to the United States. The United 
States claimed that it has tangible proof of Pakistan's 
involvement in providing aid to Sikhs and freedom fighters in 
Kashmir. However, it had always ignored evidence presented by 
Pakistani governments proving the U.S. accusations to be false. 
Now the United States is demanding that Pakistan allow it to 
inspect its nuclear installations to satisfy the United States. 
  Our opposition has demanded calling a special session of the 
National Assembly which will begin on 28 November. The 
opposition wants to discuss all issues related to the nuclear 
program. Mr. Yusuf Reza Gelani, the assembly speaker, has said 
that because of the sensitive nature of the issue, all 
discussion must be held in a closed session. Political observers 
who do not agree with the speaker say that a closed session will 
deprive the Pakistani people of the right to know the facts. The 
government should not have closed sessions because Madam Bhutto 
had openly said that Pakistan has no nuclear weapon and its 
whole program is geared to peaceful uses. In order to have the 
world believe this fact, it is important that not only there be 
open discussions in the National Assembly, but also that there 
should be no delay in giving permission to inspect the nuclear 
installations. These steps will help Pakistan get out of the 
clutches of the Pressler Amendment, and the U.S. economic and 
military aid will be restored. Japan and the European nations 
will also show their understanding and make good their promises 
to provide economic aid. 
  In the context of permission to inspect the nuclear 
installation, Pakistan can expect the United States, European 
nations, and Japan to show more interest in resolving the 
Kashmir issue. If the Kashmir issue is resolved peacefully, the 
question of nuclear weapons will lose its importance. Pakistan 
can make an agreement with India in such a way that it does not 
have to worry about its security. India and Pakistan can 
increase economic cooperation and improve joint capital 
investments to strengthen their mutual trust. The U.S. policy 
also asks for cooperation between the two nations to the extent 
that the situation is stabilized in South Asia. If the United 
States and its allies continued to have concern about Pakistan's 
nuclear policy, Pakistan cannot be expected to receive favorable 
treatment from these powers. Pakistan's demand for equal 
treatment of India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue is 
reasonable; however, the United States forms its policies 
according to its own needs. Our problem is that the United 
States is in a position to follow its policies while our 
resources to oppose it are limited. We cannot ignore the fact 
that India is much larger than Pakistan both from population and 
geographic perspectives. It can become a major market for U.S. 
products. The United States wants to keep its eye on the Indian 
market because of its own economic interests, and wants to get 
various benefits from India during this decade. The U.S. 
economic experts have observed the emergence of the middle class 
in India, and its purchasing power is expect to rise. The U.S. 
statisticians estimate that the number of middle class members 
will increase to 150 million during the next 10 years, and the 
there will be a significant increase in the buyers of U.S. 
products and technology. The U.S. economic interests are the 
cornerstones of its foreign policy. These interests forced it to 
go to war against Iraq, and it benefitted a lot from it. It is 
giving India a preferential status because of the economic 
issues, and has made a policy to keep it happy. All these facts 
should be understood and remembered. If we ignore the facts, we 
will be making the biggest mistake in history. If Madam Bhutto 
is trying to find a safe place in the U.S. proposed new world 
order, we should cooperate with her in this effort. Madam Bhutto 
had announced before she came to power again that Pakistan had 
to establish a place in the new world order.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Chinese Defense Loans for Pakistan"] </F>
  [Text] A defense agreement was signed between China and 
Pakistan. According to this agreement China will provide 
Pakistan loans for purchasing defense equipment. There is no 
doubt that China is Pakistan's brother and friend. No agreement 
with such a great friend should surprise us. In the present 
situation, no two countries can be friendly or get angry at each 
other without the prior approval of world powers. Therefore, 
Pakistan's agreement with China is a good omen for us. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has been in office for about 
one and a half months. This is a major and significant 
achievement during this brief period and shows that the foreign 
office of the present government is active. China is an 
important country for supplying weapons to third world countries 
at reduced rates. The United States and other international 
powers are putting pressure on China to supply weapons only to 
the countries that are on the U.S. approved list, and not to the 
countries that the United States does not like. Still, China 
follows its own foreign policy despite suffering problems and 
losses in this context. He is trying to improve friendship with 
other counties, especially Pakistan, by offering them new 
defense agreements. No doubt this is a brave step on China's 
part and we cannot praise it enough. 
  The United States accused China recently of supplying 
missiles and related technology to Pakistan, although both China 
and Pakistan have denied this accusation by saying that they had 
not violated any Missile Technology Contract (MTC). Similarly, 
the United States forced a Chinese commercial ship to stop in 
the Gulf while it was on its way to Iran loaded with commercial 
goods. The United States accused China of carrying defense 
equipment on this ship that came under international agreements. 
China agreed to let them inspect the ship to prevent the 
situation from becoming dangerous. This inspection proved that 
there was nothing objectionable in the Chinese ship; it carried 
general commercial goods. The United States also imposed 
restrictions on Chinese purchase of computers and other defense 
equipment. 
  To ensure the success of their policies, the international 
powers not only put pressure on countries that supply defense 
equipment, but also put pressure on countries that purchase 
them. All agreements are successful or unsuccessful only after 
international powers have checked them using their dichotomous 
policies. Against this international background, this defense 
agreement will prove to be a glorious chapter in China-Pakistan 
friendship. The importance of this defense pact can be 
understood by the fact that General Ziang, commander-in-chief of 
Chinese armed forces, was present there. This agreement 
strengthens cooperation and friendship between the armed forces 
of two countries. We hope that during Benazir Bhutto's rule this 
great brotherly and friendly relationship between Pakistan and 
China at the levels of government and the people will continue 
to get stronger and stronger.

<F P=106> [Article by Zaffar Mehmood Sheikh: "Nuclear Program Sold to </F>
the United States"] 
  [Text] The government, after making excuses to the 
opposition for one week, has decided to debate the nuclear 
program in the National Assembly, and the opposition has been 
satisfied. This is the fifth regular meeting of the present 
session of the National Assembly after it was formed. It is the 
first regular meeting being called at the request of the 
opposition. According to the opposition, the purpose of the 
session that began on 28 November was to open debate on nuclear 
policy, but the government did not allow any discussion during 
the first two days of the session. The opposition had staged a 
walkout in protest. It was clear even on 28 November that the 
government did not want to hold any debate before the internal 
elections in December, and it succeeded in its goal. The 
opposition objected to it strongly and caused a lot of 
commotion. It walked out of the meetings held on 28 November and 
1 December. The fact is that the opposition itself did not want 
to hold the debate on the nuclear issue before the election, it 
just wanted to gain some momentum which the law minister 
provided very well. Interestingly, the only thing the PPP 
[Pakistan People's Party] government did after it took office 
was to let the nation know that the Taj Mahal of desires, the 
dream of the atomic bomb or nuclear capability, had 
disintegrated three years ago. There is no example of such an 
insult to the desires of the people as was done by our rulers by 
making deals with the United States over the nuclear program. 
The governments of the PPP and the Muslim League have taken 
turns in ruling the nation since 1995, and both are equally 
guilty of selling the nuclear program to the United States. That 
is why both the parties were scared that some "truths" might be 
spilled during the debate in the assembly, and they suffered 
losses. Still, the opposition or the Muslim League had to raise 
the nuclear issue in the National Assembly because the PPP had 
accused the Muslim League of the whole fiasco by saying that 
"Nawaz Sharif sold the atomic bomb during his government." Now 
the PPP also wants to get rid of the allegation that it was 
alone in this crime. Anyhow, only time will tell what 
discussions will take place and what facts will be brought to 
light during the debate in the National Assembly. One thing is 
clear, any more information than what has already been shared 
will not come to light. Our government has sold the atomic bomb 
to Senator Larry Pressler instead of selling it to Iran. There 
are two important aspects of this deal. First, U.S. aid was 
bought in exchange for the sale of the atomic bomb. Second, a 
second hushed agreement was to help us get rid of the Kashmir 
problem and to help rid our leaders of the nuclear problem. The 
fact is that every Pakistani government was not in a position to 
open up to the people over such important issues as the nuclear 
program. Every government and every party has made some deal 
with the United States over these issues, especially the nuclear 
issue. That is why the former and the present ruling parties, 
the Muslim League and the PPP, do not want to talk about it at 
least until the internal elections. It should also be mentioned 
is that it is good idea to discuss sensitive and important 
issues in the Parliament. We should go a bit further and discuss 
topics of national importance at the national level so that all 
opinions are shared with the people and the people can feel 
involved in formation of these policies. Unfortunately, however, 
the atmosphere in the present Parliament is disgraceful. 
  It would be useless to expect any concrete results from this 
exercise since this debate is taking place in an atmosphere of 
doubt about our rulers. It would not be inappropriate to say 
that those who will be talking loudly about it do not even have 
the right information about this issue. Most of them did not 
even know what the former chief of the Navy, Aslam Baig, got in 
return for selling the nuclear program to the United States. No 
one will be able to tell us if we have to sell the "atom" why 
was it sold to the United States, and not to Iran. If nothing 
else, some dignity could have been salvaged from this insult. 
Anyhow, the situation has deteriorated so much and our social 
system has fallen so low that no one is disturbed by this issue. 
Whatever the United States wants is happening now, had happened, 
and we are afraid will happen in the future. 
  Our rulers and leaders have dragged the people in the 
streets 
into every problem and every issue so many times that the people 
have no faith in them nor do they have any energy left to be 
insulted. Now the people of this nation will just watch this 
drama of insults and embarrassments from afar. The rulers 
sitting in the capital have begun to understand it because they 
have seen the actual demonstration of this attitude during the 
long marches. They are trying to take advantage of this attitude 
now. By looking at the expression on the faces of the rulers, 
sitting in the capital and ruling the 120 million people, and 
their "bosses," we can tell without any mistake that they are 
preparing the people for something else by telling them about 
the death of the nuclear program at this time. What is that? We 
cannot even imagine it. However, we will have an idea during the 
next few days. The indications do not look good.

<F P=106> [Article by Nusrat Mirza: "The Kashmir Issue and the United </F>
States and China"] 
  [Text] The U.S. State Department's demand that "China 
should also leave Kashmir" has surprised many people. This has 
made the situation even more complicated, and it also shows that 
the United States is taking a keen interest in this issue. The 
question is, why? However, the first question is: Is China 
really occupying a part of Kashmir? Both Pakistan and China have 
declared that China has not taken over any part of Kashmir. The 
Americans say that Pakistan had given this part of Kashmir to 
China according to an agreement between the two countries. 
Although, there was an agreement over border between Pakistan 
and China, it is not clear if Pakistan did ([word missing]). 
Then what do these words of the U.S. spokesman mean? There is no 
proof of Gilgit and Hunza being part of Kashmir for the last 100 
years. 
  One thing, however, is clear. The United States is 
increasingly interested in the Kashmir issue. Does it: 
  1. Want to complicate the issue or is it increasing pressure 
on China to make this issue a defense topic? 
  2. Talk about the third option or Kashmir's independence so 
that it can control this region later [for the following 
reasons]? 
  i. it can keep eyes on Pakistan, China and India. It can, 
at least, control India and Pakistan this way. 
  ii. it wants to establish its control over this beautiful 
region so it can be used as a "recreation" and "rest" area in 
Asia for the Americans. iii. perhaps it wants to 
keep its eyes on Central Asia and Russia and add the northern 
region presently under Pakistan to it. The borders of Pakistan 
and China meet here and the Americans have mentioned it. 
  iv. it is possible that there are special minerals in this 
region and only the United States knows about it and wants to 
mine them. 
  v. As the only superpower in the world, it wants to control 
the Himalayas, the greatest mountain range in the world, and has 
the control of the roof of the world, Siachen. 
  vi. There might be another reason which we do not know. 
  Kashmir is definitely beautiful and is known as the heaven 
on 
earth. There are many other regions and areas in the world which 
are unique in their beauty, but one cannot take over all the 
beautiful regions. Its beauty is an additional asset. The most 
important issue could be its strategic location. It can become a 
central place to control Pakistan, India, China, Russia, Central 
Asia, Afghanistan, and Iran or at least can be used to keep an 
eye on all these countries. Pakistan had, after all, allowed the 
United States to establish its military base at Badpir in this 
region which the United States used to keep an eye on Russia and 
China. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, it has got 
some time to make preparations before Russia is ready again. God 
has given the United States this opportunity to become the only 
superpower in the world. It will use it to scare other 
countries, especially Pakistan, and also convince India since it 
is sure of its success. Additionally, the United States is very 
interested in China and Japan. Japan, because of its economic 
growth, poses a challenge to the United States and it is trying 
to end its "economic superpower" status. It appears that the 
United States is implementing its plans now. It is possible 
that, at a time when it has no danger from anywhere and is not 
very busy, it will freeze Japanese assets to make it helpless or 
take Japanese economic affairs in its own hands. Similarly, 
China is also on its list because it has not submitted to it 
like Russia did. At present it is making China go through the 
same phase as Pakistan and is providing it American equipment, 
weapons, computers, and loans among other things. The United 
States has put it, just like Pakistan, in the favored nation 
clause, and is pressuring it over the human rights issue. It 
appears to be ready to close its options ([blank]) and curtail 
its rights. In the past when China was behind the Iron Curtain, 
or the United States was after China or it was busy in the war 
between North and South Korea and China was surrounded from all 
sides, Pakistan was the only route that China could use to 
contact other countries in the world. 
  Pakistan has started the PIA [Pakistan International 
Airlines] flights between Beijing and Islamabad or Karachi and 
introduced China to the United States. Pakistan had to face 
great pressure and problems in this effort. China has always 
stood by Pakistan in difficult times. That is why the friendship 
between China and Pakistan is still very strong. All kinds of 
conspiracies are afoot to weaken it. The construction of the 
Silk Highway between Pakistan and China has connected the two 
countries and made ground travel between them possible in all 
seasons. It has been commonly argued in Pakistan that the United 
States considers this connection by ground a block in its 
efforts and wants to remove it. Now that the State Department 
spokesman has involved China in the Kashmir issue, it is 
definite that the United States wants to break up this ground 
connection between China and Pakistan, and wants to separate 
these two countries. Many other efforts are also being made in 
this connection. For example, Chinese engineers working in 
Pakistan were abducted many times. There was a lot of unrest in 
Xianjiang over religious awakening there, and efforts were made 
to blame Pakistan for this unrest. The Chinese were told that 
the Kashmiri freedom struggle will affect the Muslim-majority 
province of Xianjiang. 
  There are also proofs of U.S. efforts encouraging the 
Kashmiris to form a separate country. In 1989, Robert Oakley, 
then U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, asked Kashmir Premier Mumtaz 
Rathore why a third option on Kashmir was considered. Similarly, 
the French ambassador talked about it to Nawabzada Nasruallah 
Khan. These days, CNN and other news media are airing news about 
Kashmir prominently, which is good because it would attract 
world attention to atrocities being committed in Kashmir, and 
would leave India alone. However, this does not seem to be 
happening. The situation is moving in another direction. Fears 
have increased now that the United States has started to mention 
China in the context of Kashmir. 
  In addition, we can assume that the United States is 
interested in either Kashmir's strategic location or resources, 
for example, there are plenty of minerals which the nature had 
given to Kashmir for centuries. The reason for this fear is that 
it has happened in the past. Africa was ravaged in the 19th 
century because of minerals there. The white people made the 
black natives their slaves and took, and still are taking, the 
minerals from there. It is not of the past but a fact of 
yesterday when they made elaborate plans to control the oil 
wells in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and to make Japan depend on 
them. It had Iran and Iraq fight, and later encouraged Iraq to 
invade Kuwait. Then it quickly sent troops there and 
established its control over the oil wells in Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, and other Arab nations under the pretext of defending 
Saudi Arabia. Before that they tried to get Pakistan's support 
to control these oil wells by letting the United States 
establish military bases here so it could control oil routes in 
the Arabian Sea. Pakistan managed to keep itself out of it. The 
United States benefitted from the Iraq war in one way. Smaller 
nations find themselves helpless against modern U.S. weapons. 
They have accepted defeat without fighting and have knelt down 
in front of the United States. We used to praise the United 
States, the open mindedness of its people, and its help to free 
world nations. We considered it to be a nation of high caliber 
and champion of the free world nations. The situation has 
changed now and fear has replaced the feeling of respect which 
is not good for the Americans themselves. The United States is 
losing good friends. I would like to request that the United 
States be admonished about it and that history be explained to 
it. It must be told that its attitude is not correct. It has not 
seen the destructiveness of war on its land for centuries. We 
know that it is moving toward a major crisis. That is why I 
presented the idea that we protect ourselves while the United 
States is focused on other issues. I want to say now that we 
should organize a nongovernment movement which can play a role 
in the future when something happens that we do not want. We 
must express official reaction to it and not bow our head down 
totally.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Formula on Kashmir"] </F>
  [Text] The JANG has been informed through its Lahore 
correspondent that Pakistan and India have agreed on the 
three-point formula that the United States proposed on Kashmir. 
According to this formula both countries will recall their armed 
forces from Siachen in the first phase and from Azad Kashmir and 
occupied Kashmir in the second phase. In the third phase, an 
interim government in Jammu-Kashmir will be established to hold 
a plebiscite. According to high-level U.S. sources, the United 
States wants to implement this plan before September 1994, and 
Pakistan and India will reduce their defense expenditures after 
it. 
  Ostensibly, this U.S. formula appears to be harmless and 
promising. However, it is being kept a secret as to who in 
Pakistan agreed to this formula. If the present government has 
agreed to it, then who gave it the right to secretly and quietly 
make an agreement over this extremely important national issue? 
The Kashmir issue is unlike electing a party chairperson where 
they call a meeting of the executive committee and make a 
decision. This issue involves not only the Pakistani people but 
also the question of the life and death of 10 million Kashmiris. 
At present, we are not concerned with the formula itself. The 
question is why were the Pakistani people and the Kashmiris not 
taken into confidence over it? It is a proven fact that any 
project done stealthily always has some flaws in it. We already 
have found problems with this formula. According to our 
information, this formula was not created in one day; the U.S. 
representative has been coming and going here for it. Deputy 
Secretary of State Clifton Wharton and Assistant Secretary for 
South Asia Robin Raphael played very important roles in its 
formation. They had the Indian Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit come 
to Washington in August 1993 to inform him about this formula. 
Later, General Hoover, an important American official, had 
informed the Pakistani caretaker government about this formula. 
It was decided that this formula would be implemented after the 
"elected" government in Pakistan was established. As soon as 
this "elected government" was established, Robin Raphael arrived 
in Pakistan and, after settling all the details, started moving 
things around to pave way for its implementation. Muyeen Qureshi 
was asked to present himself at the U.S. behest and details were 
settled with his help. However, he did not open his mouth for 
three months, and decided with the United States that the plan 
will be carried out when the elected government is in office. 
  Madam Rafael arrived here with the formula a few days before 
the new government took over. If this is true then why did the 
elected government not present it to the elected National 
Assembly? What was the reason for keeping quiet about it? There 
is no doubt that something is wrong? 
  As for the formula itself, its third phase especially calls 
for some attention. According to it, Jammu-Kashmir will either 
be under UN custody or India and Pakistan will find a way for 
joint administration. An interim government with India and 
Pakistan's agreement and Kashmiri leaders' involvement will be 
established in Kashmir. This interim government will hold a 
plebiscite within a short period. Obviously, Azad Kashmir is 
included in this formula. A third option will be included in the 
plebiscite. As for the question of placing the whole of Kashmir 
under the United Nations supervision, we have stated in these 
columns in the past that this idea was also presented during 
Nawaz Sharif's government. According to one source, the former 
prime minister had agreed to this formula. He had mentioned 
support for the third option himself after it. This is not a new 
idea. However, the most dangerous aspect of this formula is 
putting Kashmir under the United Nations for a long period. We 
can easily imagine what would happen during that time. After it, 
the possibility of the third option will become stronger. 
Perhaps, this is the real formula and India would have agreed to 
it. It would be safer this way. Anyhow, whatever the issue is, 
it must be presented in the National Assembly for open 
discussions. It is difficult to eat rice pudding if you cook it 
quietly.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Prime Minister's Rightful Stand"] </F>
  [Text] India is trying to become a permanent member of the 
Security Council. Perhaps some major powers appear to be 
supporting India on this issue. India and its supporting nations 
believe that it should get this seat because it is a large 
country and has substantial military resources. India will be 
able to get the veto right if it becomes a permanent member of 
the Security Council. At present, the five permanent 
members--the United States of America, Russia, China, Great 
Britain, and France--have this right. 
  There are not one or two, but several examples of how the 
major powers have abused the veto right at will. Whenever the 
Security Council approved a disciplinary action against Israel, 
the United States made it ineffective using its veto power. The 
Soviet Union also showed similar inclination in the past. It 
also used the veto without paying attention to justice and 
fairness. Therefore, making India a member of the Security 
Council and giving it the veto right would be hurting the 
prestige of this international organization. Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto is justified and right in her stand that India 
should not be allowed to become a member of the Security 
Council. Benazir Bhutto openly told in a press conference in 
Turkey's capital Ankara last Saturday that Pakistani people are 
strongly opposed to India's becoming a permanent member of the 
UN Security Council since it has been continuously ignoring the 
resolutions about Kashmir. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's objection has considerable 
weight. A government that has been neglecting UN resolutions and 
refusing self-government to Kashmiris cannot be given membership 
to the Security Council. Additionally, India's attitude toward 
Pakistan and other countries in this region has never been good. 
It has always tried to take advantage of its being a large 
country. If India still is made a permanent member of the 
Security Council, it will increase its atrocities in Kashmir and 
its negative activities in this region will also increase. The 
United States and other countries know India's character very 
well. The proposal to make India a permanent Security Council 
member is just to make India a likely opponent of China in Asia. 
Still, this proposal should be opposed with full force.

<F P=106> [Article by Abdullah Malik: "Nuclear Program, Kashmir </F>
Problem, and Benazir Bhutto"] 
  [Text] At the time the United States was arranging its 
priorities regarding Pakistan, it actually had its finger on the 
right nerve. It knew that the most popular leader and 
organization in Pakistan was Benazir Bhutto and her Pakistan 
People's Party [PPP]. In any case, be it the U.S. government or 
any other Western government, Benazir Bhutto would be their 
first preference, because Benazir's philosophy and beliefs fit 
perfectly into the framework of their international policies and 
the new world order. For example, Benazir is the political 
heiress to a family and a father who had impressed the Western 
countries by their education, insight, diplomacy, and 
cosmopolitan viewpoint. Her father had made the whole third 
world his supporter by raising the slogan of a new international 
order on the other side. Then, with the discussions about the 
nuclear bomb, he had made a soft spot for himself in the whole 
Arab world. Now there is a fight. The sister, brother, and the 
mother had been benefitting from the soft spot in the heart of 
the Arab world for many years. They are still benefitting one 
way or the other. It is true that the Arab nations could not 
save Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto from hanging, but that was because of 
General Ziaul Haq had no other alternative. Both of them were 
close to the hangman's noose at that time. Had Ziaul Haq saved 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto from hanging and sent him abroad, he would 
have been hanged himself sooner or later. Freeing Bhutto for Zia 
meant inviting his own death. 
  Anyhow, General Zia made a deal that was less harmful to 
him. 
He knew well that Bhutto's hanging would make him a martyr, and 
he also knew that this martyrdom would make the PPP and the 
Bhutto family triumphant. General Ziaul Haq was safe behind the 
international atmosphere, the flare-up in Afghanistan, and the 
swirl of the revolution there. The world powers were forced to 
cajole him. Interestingly enough, when the Afghan revolution 
after the first phase began to appear pro-Soviet Union and 
anti-United States, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto began to give the 
impression from jail that communism was spreading and Southeast 
Asia was being taken over by communism, and that it was only 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who could save this communist invasion. 
  We tend to forget history, may it be old or recent. In 1978, 
when Afghanistan and the Soviet Union signed their 20-year 
friendship agreement, the central executive of the PPP expressed 
grave concern over it and passed a resolution at Zulfiqar Ali 
Bhutto's insistence. The purpose of this resolution was to 
convince the United States that the situation created by the 
changes and the revolution in Afghanistan might hurt U.S. 
interests, and that if there was anyone who had the fortitude 
and courage to stop this process it was Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. 
Therefore, his release was in the U.S. interest. Bhutto's brain 
was working fully even when he was in jail fighting to stay 
alive. He was analyzing the foreign politics and changes there 
very carefully and wanted the United States to use pressure for 
his release. The efforts that Bhutto made all by himself in his 
jail cell during that period can be important subject of 
research and analysis. However, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was just 
unlucky as detailed in the diaries kept by the British High 
Commissioner Sir Marlese James. These diaries were published 
recently under the title Pakistan Chronicle. The fact is that 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had lost trust at the diplomatic level. The 
United States understood well that if it helped Bhutto's release 
it would be creating an enemy of America who was very popular. 
That is the same fact that has convinced not only Benazir Bhutto 
but most of our politicians that the first condition to rule 
Pakistan is to get approval from the military and the United 
States of America. The United States also needed a popular 
leader to help meet its own goals in this region. This need, 
according to it, could be best filled by Benazir Bhutto. Thus, 
the drama of elections was staged to achieve this goal. The U.S. 
administration started to hint about holding elections a year 
and a half ago. As soon as armed confrontation started in 
Kashmir, the United States got worried about the situation in 
this region. For the last two or three years, the way Pakistani 
government's under Nawaz Sharif's leadership was trying to make 
Kashmir an international issue had forced the United States to 
be serious about this issue or at least give the impression of 
its being serious to the Pakistani people. At the same time, the 
Nawaz Sharif government joined the nuclear issue with the 
regional and international politics. Nawaz Sharif's greatest 
achievement was to propose the five-nation conference to resolve 
the nuclear issue in Pakistan and India. It left India alone and 
friendless at international level because four countries were 
supporting this conference and only India was against it. 
  This was the international situation in which the elections 
were held. The U.S. government and nonaligned and aligned people 
assumed that Benazir Bhutto would emerge as the power. However, 
as the adage goes, "I was bathing and the fly was washed away." 
It was the most prominent misconception in Pakistani politics 
that the PPP has the largest vote bank and Benazir Bhutto is the 
most popular leader. However, when the elections were held, 
Nawaz Sharif also joined the race. He presented his charismatic 
personality ahead of his inexperience and neglectful deeds on 
the political chess board. This development has changed the 
whole political framework. This situation has puzzled the U.S. 
administration and has surrounded Benazir with whirlpool of 
problems. Benazir Bhutto and the PPP had thought that they would 
be able to force the U.S. point of view on the people using 
their popularity. It has begun to appear difficult now. Nawaz 
Sharif and his opposition group is fully aware of Benazir and 
PPP's helplessness. That is why Nawaz Sharif is talking about 
Kashmir and the nuclear program in every breath he takes. 
  Meanwhile the United States had shown some flexibility and 
had tried to convince the people that the U.S. attitude was 
changing after Benazir's arrival, and Benazir had also tried to 
use this to her advantage. However, when the U.S. government 
observed the reaction of the opposition party and the people, it 
changed its approach, and began to repeat its old stand of 
depriving Pakistan of aid as long as it was suspected of making 
nuclear weapons. Although Benazir is emphasizing that she will 
not accept any pressure over the nuclear program, her refusal to 
open debate on this issue in the National Assembly only 
intensifies many suspicions. Saying that the nuclear program 
cannot be made a topic of discussion in every street and corner 
is childish. There have been demonstrations in Japan against the 
nuclear program for months. Why cannot we discuss this issue in 
our assembly?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Goals Will Fulfill Goals"] </F>
  [Text] It is generally believed that the real reason for 
tension with the United States is Pakistan's nuclear program. 
The United States does not believe that this program is for 
peaceful uses and suspects that Pakistan wants to make atomic 
bombs. Because of this suspicion, it stopped military and 
economic aid to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment. The 
United States is not satisfied with Pakistan even after the 
nuclear program was frozen. It is pressing us to roll back the 
nuclear program, to permit the inspection of nuclear 
installations, and to unilaterally sign the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty]. However, this is plain blackmail. 
Actually the United states wants to make Pakistan dependent on 
it. Since Pakistan is not willing to become dependent, the 
United States at times accuses it of making nuclear weapons, and 
at other times threatens to declares it a terrorist nation. What 
the United States wants is clear from the U.S. Ambassador John 
Minzo's speech at the American Association of Pakistani Doctors 
last Saturday. 
  The U.S. ambassador said that relations between the two 
countries would be very good if Pakistan agreed with the United 
States. He said in his speech that relations between the two 
countries have improved compared to the past, and there is the 
possibility that these relations will become more stable if 
Pakistan supports U.S. international policies. What the U.S. 
ambassador has said is very true. If Pakistan was dependent on 
the United States, and had become its ally, the United States 
would have no complaints or accusations against Pakistan. U.S. 
international policies are not hidden from any one. 
  The United States cannot tolerate the idea of Pakistan's 
friendly relations with China. It does not like Pakistan's 
brotherly relations with Iran, Iraq, Libya, and other Muslim 
nations either. It also wants Pakistan to recognize Israel and 
to establish diplomatic relations with it. However, the U.S. 
ambassador should fully understand that Pakistan is an 
independent nation. The Pakistani people are Muslims with a firm 
faith in their religion. They cannot break up their traditional 
friendship with these countries for U.S. happiness and aid. 
Opportunistic and cowardly nations change their ideologies and 
policies. The Pakistani people are not cowards and will not 
compromise their principles under pressure or for greed. 
Pakistan's relations with China can become more stable. Pakistan 
will continue its efforts toward unity and cooperation among 
Muslim nations. Israel will not be recognized at all. Similarly, 
Pakistan will not roll back its nuclear program under any 
pressure or for any greed. The United States is indeed a 
superpower, and it can blackmail and harass Pakistan. However, 
it cannot force us to cooperate with it. No Pakistani government 
can compromise national prestige and pride. Pakistan also has 
courageous and patriotic leaders like Imam Khomeini, Saddam 
Hussein, Colonel Gaddafi, and Farah Adid who are capable of 
being firm with the time of test.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Not Induct OIC"] </F>
  [Text] What had begun as a humanitarian mission in 
Somalia, by now has turned into a military quagmire seething 
with all foreign participants' desperate effort to get out. 
Apart from over 10,000 Somalis killed during the UN military 
operations, about 70 foreign peacekeepers have died. Amongst the 
UN peacekeepers' casualties, 30 are of soldiers from the United 
States. Technologically the strongest military machine in the 
world as represented by the 9000 servicemen on US ships off the 
Somalian coast, has been supporting some 30,000 UN soldiers 
drawn from 28 countries. 
  This did not reassure most of the contributors to the UN 
expedition. The American public that has yet to recover from the 
Vietnam syndrome, could not stomach the sight of the dead bodies 
of US soldiers dragged about in Mogadishu's streets. Elected 
representatives of the American people rightly raised two basic 
questions. One, what the US servicemen were doing in Somalia in 
the first place. Two, which aspect of the US security was 
involved in Somalia to provide constitutional justification to 
President Clinton to deploy US troops in that remote African 
country. Faced with mounting domestic hostility to its military 
involvement in the African country, Washington had no option but 
to call it a day. Some of the Europeans were smart enough to 
jump ship well in time. Especially noteworthy were the Italians 
who amongst all westerners knew their Somalia because of their 
past colonial role in that country. 
  Forced by its laws and an increasingly hostile public 
opinion 
at home, Washington has resorted to the familiar subterfuge of 
trying to achieve its objective through proxies. But the 
dimensions of the conceptual flaw in the Somalian misadventure 
is becoming glaring enough for the United States to wash its 
hands off and shift the entire blame to UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali. Left holding the baby, it is Ghali now who is 
designated as the conceiver of the Somalian operation. 
  Transferring the blame elsewhere, the United States is doing 
the same to its Somalian military role and in this respect, 
Pakistan is willing to carry most of the burden. With 5,000 
soldiers, Islamabad already has the largest representation in 
the UN Somalian contingent and this is increasing steadily. With 
32 of its soldiers dead, Pakistan's loss is the largest amongst 
all contributors to the force. Although the life of a Pakistani 
is not considered as valuable as that of an American, Islamabad 
should ponder over some crucial aspects of its willingness to 
shoulder US burden. 
  It is widely known that wherever Langley House finds its 
style cramped by domestic legislative restrictions, it inducts 
Saudi or any other intelligence agency which collaborates with 
the CIA. But by their very nature, the clandestine operations 
remain hidden and have vast room for wriggling out of a tight 
corner. But in any military involvement, it is not that easy to 
disclaim responsibility. The UN operations around the world by 
now are widely perceived as another means of furthering US 
objectives. Pakistan needs to guard against emerging eventually 
as what the Americans call the fall guy. 
  If Pakistan believes that it is doing a service to brother 
Muslims in Somalia, the correct authority for the Pakistani 
contingent's operations in Somalia should be the Organisation of 
the Islamic Conference [OIC]. Irrespective of the OIC's 
credibility as a forum of all Muslim countries operating 
independent of any non- Muslim decisive influence, its 
nomenclature demands action on important issues that entail 
supreme sacrifice by a Muslim soldier.

<F P=106> [Article: "Pakistan-U.S. Relations--United States Never Was </F>
Faithful"] 
  [Text] Our American "friends" first took the ships back 
from the Navy, then refused to supply F-16 planes to Pakistan, 
even though the price of these planes was already paid. The 
situation is such that our coast is undefended, and the absence 
of the F-16 in our space shows that we cannot defend our land 
and sea. Mr. Pressler declared Pakistan a hostile nation three 
years ago. Perhaps he does not know the difference between 
gunpowder and atomic bombs. The American policy shows that they 
want to make Pakistan a sacrificial lamb or goat and throw it in 
front of the bloodthirsty wolves. 
  If we review relations between the United States and 
Pakistan, it is clear that the United States has not been 
faithful even to its good friends. There is an old adage used by 
the soldiers in the West: If you are faithful to your friend, 
then you are unfaithful to God. The Americans follow this adage 
perfectly. In the Gulf War, it started Operation Desert Storm to 
help its friends. It then demanded billions of dollars to meet 
its war expenses. First it emphasized the need for nuclear power 
in Pakistan, and when Pakistan reached its goal of producing 
nuclear power, it then began to make noise and asked it to stop. 
  When India exploded a nuclear bomb in May 1974, it was 
commended, even though India had fought wars with both China and 
Pakistan. America is extremely powerful, but because of its 
biased nature, its foreign policy has been very ineffective. It 
is falling in the eyes of the free world. The United States had 
no desire for Pakistan to reduce its defense budget. The 
Americans praised their agents for this goal, and then had them 
raise the slogan that Pakistan must reduce its defense expenses. 
Why should we reduce defense expenses? No logical reason was 
given for this. 
  Pakistan has had an open stand, that militarily weak 
Pakistan 
had always been a "delicious morsel" for India to devour. India 
had always suppressed the weak, be it in the Kashmir issue, Goa, 
Nepal, Bhutan, Hyderabad (Deccan), Junagarh, Manavdar, Mangrol, 
Naxalbari, the Nagas, Mizo tribals, or former East Pakistan. 
India always forced itself into any place where it saw weakness. 
The Americans always supported India in Asia and have ignored 
India's belligerence, war craze, and expansionist designs. 
  The balance of military power is essential for a stable, 
peaceful environment, especially in Asian and African nations; 
however, the United States of America has also tried to 
establish India's supremacy in Asia. A good air, land, and sea 
army is important for any country. If Pakistan wants to 
strengthen and stabilize its defense forces, that is its natural 
and legal right. 
  The United States, because of its erroneous policy, or to 
gain specific goals, wants to impose restrictions on its 
"weapons." If it does not change this attitude, there is the 
strong possibility that Pakistan will get its military needs 
from Western nations and China. 
  The United States believes that Pakistan cannot function 
without its technology. The Americans are wrong. They are not 
fully aware of the skills of the Pakistani people. The question 
arises: Since the United States is a trading nation, is it 
backing away from its agreement in order to put pressure on 
Pakistan to close its nuclear plant? Can the nuclear plant be 
closed? 
  The way the United States wants to disarm Pakistan in the 
name of peace in Asia is causing negative results. Just because 
of U.S. stubbornness, the whole nation agrees on the point that 
Pakistan should make a nuclear bomb, and should talk to other 
countries in order to meet its needs. 
  The Americans should think about it all since they have 
themselves made thousands of nuclear bombs and stored them in 
safe places, they have spent billions of dollars and established 
two "secure places" underground, where nuclear radiation cannot 
reach. The Pakistani army is not a police force; it also has to 
protect and defend the nation. It also is endangered by India's 
expansionist designs. Of course, the armed forces keep the 
Pakistani government informed about its needs. The Pakistani 
army cannot expect internal and external pressures. 
  The present Pakistani government, led by Madam Benazir 
Bhutto, who represents a strong and flawless political heritage, 
is expected to keep in mind the needs of military Pakistan. 
Madam Benazir Bhutto surely considers Pakistan more important 
than her own life, and she is aware of the needs of our armed 
forces. If the Americans do not review their attitude, they will 
soon lose their good friends. It is also possible that Benazir 
Bhutto will make changes in her new social contract and will 
order military training for all men and women under the age 45. 
Perhaps the Americans want a peaceful nation to become a 
belligerent one; however, the Pakistani people want to benefit 
from peaceful but modern technology. The United States should 
participate in the effort to make Pakistan a peaceful area, one 
that is strong in defense. Every U. S. president has said during 
the last half century that a strong, stable America is important 
for world peace. Will not a strong Pakistan assure peace in Asia?

<F P=106> [News Report: "U.S. Wants To Destroy Muslims Through Our </F>
Government--Munawwar Hussein"] 
  [Text] Jhang (Special Correspondent)--The United States 
wants to exterminate Muslims through our rulers because all 
these rulers are its obedient followers and pay homage at its 
doors. Sayyed Munawwar Hussein, secretary general of 
Jamaat-i-Islami, stated this in a meeting here today. He said 
that our rulers ignore the problems faced by our people just to 
make the United States happy. This way these rulers are used to 
keep the people away from Islamic movements. There is a spread 
baseless propaganda against these movements. Movements to help 
establish Islamic identity are accused of terrorism and 
fundamentalism. While commenting on the international situation, 
he said that the United States has recognized its target. It 
considers Islam a danger to it. Secularism cannot tolerate 
Muslims, and secularism, be it Western or Eastern, commits 
atrocities against the people. Its proof is the abominations 
committed day and night against the Muslims in Bosnia. About 
Afghanistan, he said that pro-Soviet intellectuals had advised 
us that this issue should be taken care of through negotiations 
with the Soviet Union. However, the Afghans not only embarrassed 
it in Afghanistan but in the whole world. It proved that the 
only superpower there is Allah who can make one great or little. 
All honors and humiliations are in His hands. Commenting on the 
new world order, he said the United States wants to do whatever 
it desires and no one should question it. That is why it makes 
all these plans, and that is why it sent its armed forces to 
Somalia. However, when its troops were being killed, it announce 
their recall and thus Allah made its plans fail. Those who say 
that Islam could not be implemented with jihad in Afghanistan 
and with democracy in Algeria should know that the world is 
changing now. The Kashmiri people are offering their lives and 
the Muslims in Palestine and Bosnia are bravely standing against 
kafirs. The Islamic laws have been implemented in Sudan and 
there is new awakening in Malaysia. All these point to the 
bright future of Islam. Hafiz Mohammed Idris, leader of the 
Jamaat-i Islami of Punjab; Mian Maqsud Ahmed, secretary general; 
and Chowdhery MPA [Member of Provincial Assembly] also addressed 
the meeting.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Islamic Bomb--the Real U.S. Fear"] </F>
  [Text] Three U.S. Senators addressed a press conference 
together in Islamabad. The famous Senator Larry Pressler, whose 
amendment is being used mercilessly in Pakistan for the last two 
years and who is a living example of U.S. narrow mindedness, 
unfairness, anti-Muslim attitude, and swindles, was also there. 
The peculiarity of this law is that while dozens of countries in 
the world have nuclear bombs, it is implemented only against 
Pakistan. India has nuclear weapons as does Israel. Russia has 
nuclear weapons as do many European countries. However, the 
United States did stop economic or military aid to any of these 
countries while demanding that they roll back their nuclear 
programs, open up their nuclear installations for inspection, 
and sign a unilateral agreement on nuclear nonproliferation. All 
these conditions under the Pressler Amendment apply to Pakistan 
only. Why? Just because Pakistan is a Muslim country! Since 
Israel, Russia, and India are not Islamic nations, the United 
States does not impose these strict rules on them. Does not this 
create enmity toward Muslims and, according to the favorite U.S. 
definition, make the United States a fundamentalist itself? 
However, the United States stubbornly continues to accuse 
Pakistan and other Islamic countries of fundamentalism. These 
countries just love their national independence and want the 
world to respect them. 
  Mr. Larry Pressler was asked at the Islamabad press 
conference why the Pressler Amendment was implemented only 
against Pakistan. Is it not unfair to single out one nation in 
the world and accuse it? Mr. Larry Pressler spat out the truth 
in his response. This is part of the usual U.S. policy which is 
not admitted to at the diplomatic level. Mr. Pressler said that 
during the 1980s there was information in the media that an 
`Islamic bomb' was being made and its technical knowledge could 
be transferred from one nation to another. 
  Yes! This is the real fear and all these efforts are being 
made to stop it. Campaigns are launched against Muslim 
countries. They are surrounded after being accused of 
fundamentalism, and they are being deprived of their rights in 
the international brotherhood like second-class members. Their 
national autonomy is challenged at every step. At times, Iran is 
accused of terrorism and at other times the Sudanese government 
is censured by calling it a military dictatorship. They ask why 
General Abdul Bashir is experimenting with establishing an 
Islamic form of government? Plans to divide up Sudan and create 
a Christian country from within it are approved so that 
anti-Islamic forces could use this place as their base. The 
establishment of Muslim rule following the democratic process in 
Algeria is being objected to because the Islamic Salvation Front 
might come to power using the slogan of an Islamic form of 
government. The United States, which opposes military 
dictatorship in Sudan on principle, becomes a champion and 
supporter of a military dictatorship that is against democracy 
there. When Pakistan takes the path of self-dependence in 
defense, its efforts at self-dependence are opposed and labeled 
as efforts to make the Islamic bomb. It is threatened with being 
called a terrorist nation, its elected government is overthrown 
under a conspiracy, and a government headed by persons of its 
own liking is installed there. The Islamic world never called 
these actions Christian fundamentalism. Instead, we used 
political definitions and called it American colonialism. We did 
not denounce it using some religious terms. 
  As soon as Larry Pressler told the truth and explained the 
real reason behind the Pressler Amendment, Senator Brown, the 
other senator present in that press conference, denied the idea 
of an Islamic bomb by saying that there is no such thing as the 
Islamic bomb. The United States is just trying to stop the 
spread of nuclear weapons, and is not doing that because of a 
preference for any religion. It is not focusing on Pakistan; it 
tries to check nuclear weapons anywhere in the world where it 
knows they exist. 
  In our opinion, Mr. Brown's explanation was an effort to 
cover up. The U.S. policy is not what Mr. Brown tells us; it is 
what Mr. Pressler has explained to us. Pakistan has to accept 
Mr. Pressler's definition of U.S. policy because the law is 
based on Mr. Pressler's definition, and not on the one that 
follows the policy explained by Mr. Brown. If Mr. Brown's 
definition was correct and the United States is not just trying 
to stop the Islamic bomb, it would have put similar pressure on 
dozens of non-Muslim countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and 
South America that have become nuclear powers during the last 
two decades. No restrictions were imposed even on India under 
the Pressler Amendment. Israel, South Africa, Brazil, and 
European nations have the full freedom; pressure is being put 
only on Pakistan. 
  Mr. Pressler argues that Pakistan's bomb could get into the 
hands of Iraq or Libya any time. This is a product of a 
prejudiced Jewish or Christian mind. They are worried about 
proliferation of weapons from one country to another, but they 
do not remember that it was the United States itself that had 
installed those missiles loaded with nuclear weapons in many 
places in Europe under the NATO agreement. These missiles are 
capable of putting more than half the world to the sleep of 
death in one second. The senator, from a country that has been 
planning this dangerous game of weapons of massacre for the last 
40 years and is credited with dropping the only two atomic bombs 
deployed in history on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, killing hundreds 
of thousands of people, should be embarrassed when he states 
that Pakistani bombs could reach Iraq or Libya and cause world's 
destruction. The United States should first wipe out the stigma 
of the largest massacre of human life in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 
This U.S. attitude is making the Muslims angry. The results will 
not be good. No country remains victorious or vanquished forever.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan-China Cooperation"] </F>
  [Text] Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng has asked Chinese and 
Pakistani investors to visit each other's countries more and 
more, and to start some joint ventures so that economic 
cooperation between both countries is increased. He said that it 
is very important to increase cooperation between the two 
countries in the present international situation. This will pave 
the way for economic progress and regional cooperation. China 
also openly announced that it will continue selling weapons to 
Pakistan. Pakistan and China are trusted friends of each other, 
and both have helped one another at various forums and at the 
political level on various international and regional issues. At 
a time when the world is passing through rapid political and 
economic changes, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's visit to China 
will help improve cooperation between the two countries. This is 
evident from Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng's encouragement to 
investors in both countries to start new ventures and visit each 
other's countries, as well as continuance of selling weapons to 
Pakistan. China is an emerging economic and political power in 
the world. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the 
United States has tried to force its wishes on different parts 
of the world to meet its interests and goals. This has caused 
worry and concern among independent nations. The United States 
has started unilateral propaganda against China over human 
rights violations, breaking the missile technology agreement, 
and other issues, and has imposed restrictions on it. China has 
not only confronted all these tricks, but we can say that China 
is playing an important role in keeping the balance of power at 
international levels. Its economic progress during the twentieth 
century will leave many advanced countries behind. Therefore, 
its role at the international level will be very important in 
the future. Pakistan supported China during difficult times, and 
is its close friend. At present, when Pakistan is dealing with a 
hostile and troublesome country like India, and the United 
States of America is imposing restrictions on it on the pretext 
of a peaceful nuclear program, China's warmer friendship and 
close relationship are very important for Pakistan. Pakistan can 
not only attain self-sufficiency with China's cooperation and 
support, but can also get rid of the blackmail against it for 
defense weapons. We welcome Prime Minister Li Peng's 
announcement that he will continue selling weapons to Pakistan, 
and expect that the friendship between these two countries will 
remain on strong footing.

<F P=106> [Article by Nusrat Mirza: "Agreement on Siachen Will Be </F>
Against National Interest"] 
  [Text] According to a news report referring to a U.S. 
official, a decision has been made to keep Siachen a nonmilitary 
zone, and this agreement is being fine-tuned. I believe that any 
agreement with India over Siachen is detrimental to Pakistan. 
This will lead to our acceptance of India's supremacy, and will 
create reasons for decreasing our armed forces. Our government 
and the military would be shooting themselves in the foot if 
they did so. 
  The highest region in the world, Siachen, is also known as 
the roof of the world. It is the place where 20,000 Indian and 
Pakistani soldiers are fighting one another. It is being 
considered for an agreement, according to informal talks by 
American officials with senior journalists. We believe that such 
an agreement is not in Pakistan's interests, because battles and 
skirmishes are not fought just for winning or losing. There are 
many purposes. One purpose is military or economic. Other 
purpose is to maintain self-respect or for one's supremacy. A 
war fought for military and economic reasons, or to hurt the 
enemy's economic and military power, is fought to see how much 
harm is done to the enemy. In the present situation, this war, 
which was started by India, is proving to be very harmful to it. 
This is also showing India's weaknesses, because India is under 
great economic pressure because of this war. Some already knew 
it, and it is often being heard now that even grass does not 
grow in Siachen. If this is true, then why did India start this 
campaign? When it was planning to take over Siachen, then 
Pakistan knew that India was moving toward Siachen. Thus, 
Pakistan also started its preparations, and Pakistani and Indian 
deputations met face to face in some European countries. Both 
countries were looking to purchase special equipment to start a 
war in this cold region, where the temperature is 40 degrees 
below zero. One reason for this campaign could be that India 
wanted to surprise Pakistan and establish its supremacy over it, 
to demonstrate that it can attack Pakistan from a region which 
is extremely inaccessible. Perhaps there was a price for this 
campaign, and it has exceeded all the budgets that have been set 
for it. Therefore, for the past several years, India has shown 
interest in an agreement over Siachen. That is why the American 
officials are saying that it is easy to have an agreement on 
this issue, and that Pakistan should not give any opinion. At 
present, it seems that Pakistan is apparently willing to follow 
the policy of obeying U. S. orders. 
  India's Losses in Siachen -- From the information we have 
received from our national and international media, it appears 
that India has suffered losses ten times greater than has 
Pakistan. In other words, if ten Indians are killed, only one 
Pakistani is martyred. Economically, India's losses are many 
times greater. The prestigious magazine INDIA TODAY wrote in 
1990 about Siachen, "India's weaknesses are evident in economic 
and military movement in Siachen, because the Cheetah helicopter 
is overhauled in France, and not in India." The purpose for 
which the Cheetah is used indicates that India is not meeting 
all its military needs. Then, the number of Indian troops there 
is much greater than the number of our troops, according to 
military sources. Thus, India must be spending much more money 
there. It is also worried because of this. It is possible that 
we, too, are worried. However, it is a good strategy to keep the 
enemy occupied in such a way that it spends its energy and 
remains under economic pressure. Now, if there is an agreement 
over Siachen, it would mean that we cannot afford the expenses, 
even though they are much greater than what India is spending. 
This also means that we are in no position to protect our 
independence, because the enemy will later pressure us in other 
areas. It will also make sure that it benefits on the Kashmir 
issue, and will send these people to Kashmir. The troops that 
have been removed from the Chinese border after the agreement 
have also been sent to Kashmir. This could also mean that all 
the economic spending figures in Siachen were totally wrong, or 
that our leadership, which is "an ever-changing leadership," is 
tired. It sits down whenever it sees a shadow by a wall. Instead 
of aggravating Indian weakness, we are providing it a chance to 
breathe easy if we have an agreement over Siachen. 
  Challenge to India's Supremacy -- By opposing India in 
Siachen, Pakistan has negated the picture of India's supremacy, 
and has challenged it. That is why its supremacy was not 
accepted. Had we accepted it, we would not have been able to 
keep it occupied in Siachen. If we agree to an agreement, it 
will mean that we have accepted India's supremacy. Even if it is 
not inferred now, sooner or later, we will have to accept 
India's supremacy. 
  The fact is that challenging India in Siachen is equivalent 
to checking India's supremacy. I recognize that peace is very 
important; a peace agreement that causes additional problems is 
not a good strategy. A cease-fire that results in a greater war 
later is not appropriate. Only the tired people or those who 
refuse to learn from political and military events of the past 
do such things. The people should never give them any support. 
There is a lot of unrest in Pakistan at present, and the current 
military leadership's ability and competence are being 
questioned. 
  Reductions in the Military -- Our involvement in Siachen and 
the Kashmir issue are the major reasons for Pakistan's large 
army. If these problems are solved through American efforts, 
then Pakistan will have any reason to have a large army. This 
means that we do not ever want to resolve the problem. This is 
not true. We do want to resolve this issue, but without any 
restrictions. We cannot accept the condition of reducing our 
armed forces or rolling back our nuclear capabilities. In 
addition, we also want this issue to be resolved under a 
"package deal." It is India's need to get out of the Siachen 
problem. We will leave it there only if it agrees to resolve the 
Kashmir problem according to the UN resolutions. If we agree 
over Siachen, then India will fully benefit, and we will lose. 
It is possible that India gives the impression of giving 
something to Pakistan over Siachen. It will then take even more 
back over the Kashmir negotiations. India will benefit greatly 
by stopping military campaigns in Siachen. At the same time, it 
will heap loses for us when we discuss the Kashmir issue. If we 
have an agreement over Siachen, then we should insist on having 
a package deal without giving up our stand on reduction in the 
army or rolling back our nuclear program. The issue of reducing 
our army is being discussed by our intellectuals, politicians, 
and the people. They are talking about reducing our armed forces 
because the self-serving role of military generals in the past 
had resulted in increased interference in political affairs. 
Many efforts were made in the past to reduce our army; 
however, the people did not support these efforts, because they 
know the importance of the military for historic and 
psychological reasons. One reason is that the Hindus have not 
sincerely accepted Pakistan as a country of Muslims. They want 
to avenge the rule of Muslims over them for thousands of years 
by ruling the Muslims now. Therefore, the Hindus, through India, 
want to control Pakistan, the country of Muslims. 
  If the present military leadership, which is very 
knowledgeable about our country's affairs, makes a losing deal 
over Siachen, and shoots itself in the foot, then the people 
will have no reason to accept the additional economic pressure 
of maintaining a large army. They will sadly accept reductions 
in our armed forces. It is true that the United States is 
pressuring Pakistan to end its disagreement with India, and to 
roll back its nuclear technology. We have to remove this 
pressure by using some strategy. 
  Training of Pakistani Soldiers -- The training that our 
military troops and officers have received to fight in cold 
regions while remaining in Siachen will be of great benefit to 
us in the future. At a time when Pakistan, instead of looking 
for help inside, looks toward others, it will see many different 
kinds of scenarios that can interest it. The present era is not 
one of military campaigns; however, if there is a military 
campaign, we must be in a position to play our role actively. 
The money that is being spent for such training will prove to be 
a good investment in the future. For it, it is important that we 
keep our eye on the sky. The sky is the better place to fight 
than on land or on roofs. We can learn new things through new 
experiments. While I was living in Shangri-La Sakrud, I met a 
young military officer on 27 June 1987. He had returned from 
Siachen and was full of zeal. He explained to me an incident 
when they were all in a camp and saw a circle of light traveling 
from one site to another. They fired at it, but it was not 
affected. Slowly, the circle came close to their place of 
operation, and then disappeared. He thought there were some 
ghosts there. However, I said that someone was using a satellite 
for spying. Their experience in the Siachen war will be 
beneficial to us in the long run. If nothing else, our army can 
be part of a peacekeeping force in a cold region. 
  After presenting these arguments, I am stating again that 
any 
agreement with India over Siachen will not be in Pakistan's 
interests. This would lead to our acceptance of India's 
supremacy. India will create another opportunity to confront us, 
and it will also make India economically stronger. Also, it will 
be a cause for reducing Pakistan's military force in the future. 
India's economic weakness will be increased if it is involved in 
the Siachen war, and its dream of supremacy will remain a dream. 
The Pakistani military will gain more experience and training. 
There will be more problems for India, and it will remain 
economically backward.

<F P=106> [News Report: "Time for Sikhs' Independence Has </F>
Arrived--Gurucharan Singh"] 
  [Text] Lahore (Interview by Ahmed Nadim and Aqil 
Ahmed)--The day India attacks Pakistan will be the day Khalistan 
will be created. This was revealed by Gurucharan Singh, 
president of International Sikh Youth Federation of Norway and 
member of Council of Khalistan Advisory Committee, and Joga 
Singh, leader of the Khalistan movement in a talk with the daily 
MUSAWAT. They said that there has been no decrease in the 
intensity of the Khalistan movement. It was an Indian 
conspiracy. The government first infiltrated the organization 
with its agents posing as Sikhs and gave rise to the movement. 
Later, it pulled back its agents to sabotage the movement. 
However, the Indian government's conspiracy was unsuccessful and 
the campaign for an independent Khalistan is still going on. 
They expressed hope that Khalistan will be established after 
five years. They said that the Indian government always sends 
the Sikhs soldiers to the front in each battle so that the 
number of Sikhs is reduced. The government is afraid that these 
soldiers might form the Khalistan Army upon their discharge. 
They further said that Hindus dressed as Sikhs are in the 
forefront when Muslim shrines are debased so that Sikhs and 
Muslims would hate each other. The Indian government does not 
want to see Muslims and Sikhs united. They said that Sikhs and 
Muslims love each other. The Muslims and Sikhs took out joint 
procession in Norway to show their displeasure at the 
destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya and the siege of 
Hazratbal. They said that Indians raise the slogan of "Hindu, 
Hindi, Hindustan," which means that India is for the Hindus 
only, and those who want to live here must become Hindus. The 
Sikhs leaders said that India has the label of being a 
democracy, but there is no such thing as democracy there. In 
answer to a question, they said the issue of an independent 
nation can be raised in the United Nations. They added that they 
have no connection with terrorists and all terrorism is part of 
the Indian government's conspiracy. The Sikhs are working toward 
removing this accusation. They said that the Indian government 
put Pakistani weapons in police stations so that it can accuse 
Pakistan of helping the terrorists. They said that India will 
disintegrate just like the Soviet Union and Khalistan will be 
established. They said that the constitution and the map of 
Khalistan will be drawn after it is established. Is is certain 
that the East Punjab region of India where Punjabi is spoken 
will be part of Khalistan. Khalistan will be a democratic nation 
where the government will be established by elections and 
politics will be under religion. All minorities in Khalistan 
will have full rights and freedom to practice their religion. 
There will be the policy of open border and free trade between 
Khalistan and Pakistan. They said that their leaders were 
victims of Hindu conspiracies. Quaid-i Azam [Jinnah] was wise to 
get a separate country, Pakistan, for himself while we are still 
slaves. Now the war will continue until Khalistan is 
established. Sardar Gurucharan Singh said the minorities in 
India are treated unfairly and no one has religious freedom. The 
religious places of minorities are being violated, women are 
raped, and innocent children are killed. The Indian government 
does not follow secularism; it is also violating human and moral 
rights. Mentioning the Indian government's raid on the Golden 
Temple, he said that this attack was part of an international 
conspiracy. This attack was launched when the Sikhs were 
celebrating a religious day. More than 13,000 Sikh women and 
innocent children were killed in this raid. Similarly, the Babri 
Masjid was violated in December 1992, followed by killings of 
Muslims. Massacre of the minorities is a part of the Indian 
policy. Whenever the government wants to kill someone, it first 
declares him a terrorist. This way, it calls the freedom 
fighters in Kashmir terrorists. They declared their support for 
Kashmir's efforts for independence and said that the Muslims and 
Sikhs should unit to free Khalistan and Kashmir. Referring to 
the Indian government's atrocities, they said that raping women 
and killing young men in police confrontations have become a 
common occurrence in Punjab. Thousands of people in Kashmir and 
Punjab have been declared terrorists and then jailed. Their 
homes are attacked, the Indian police mass rapes young girls, 
and the young men who try to protest are killed. They said that 
during the British rule, Sikh, Muslim, and Hindu youth who 
opposed the police were labeled terrorists, similarly, the 
Indian government also calls anyone who supports freedom a 
terrorist. In answer to a question, they said that the Indian 
government prepared fake' Sikhs to gave a bad name to the 
freedom fighters. They are asked to commit atrocities and the 
people get the impression that the freedom fighters are involved 
in illegal activities. Similarly, [the Indian government] 
dresses its troops in Pakistani uniforms, carrying Pakistani 
weapons, and have them involved in various incidents to accuse 
Pakistan of them later. All this is done by Indian agents, 
however. They said that Quaid-i Azam did not fall prey to Hindu 
tricks in 1947, and established a separate nation, Pakistan. We 
were fooled by the Hindus and are still their slaves. However, 
we will not remain slaves for long. We will not repeat our 
leaders' mistakes. They said that when a Hindu assassinated 
Mahatma Gandhi, the whole nation was shocked, and when Indira 
Gandhi was assassinated by a Sikh, 25,000 Sikhs were killed in 
one day in Delhi only. They said that operations to control 
situations in Srinagar, Sri Lanka, and Babri Masjid are carried 
out by Sikhs troops to create hatred between Muslims and Sikhs. 
The Sikhs have risen now and will continue their struggles for 
freedom side-by-side with the Muslims. They said that the Indian 
Government had used Sikhs in the 1965 and 1971 wars, and tried 
to kill two birds with one stone--to reduce the Sikhs forces and 
to make the Muslims hate Sikhs. The Sikhs now understand this 
conspiracy. While answering a question, he expressed the hope 
that after Khalistan is established, its relations with Pakistan 
will be friendly. We share a common language and culture. They 
appealed to the Muslims all over the world to support the Sikhs 
in their struggle for freedom. They called for Sikh efforts in 
India to increase until freedom is won. The final victory will 
be ours and Khalistan will definitely be established.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Discussion and Reconciliation on the Kashmir </F>
Issue-Why?"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said in an interview 
with Iran's English newspaper, THE TEHRAN TIMES, that Pakistan 
would welcome Iran's efforts to end Indian atrocities in 
occupied Kashmir. THE TEHRAN TIMES informed that Iran is willing 
to try reconciliations between Pakistan and India in order to 
establish peace in South Asia. The Foreign Ministry 
representative, in his weekly report, gave a brief glimpse of 
the Indian atrocities in Kashmir. The spokesman said that even 
Indian newspapers and news agencies have reported that the 
Indian troops during the last few days have increased their 
atrocities against the Kashmiri people. During the night of 4 
and 5 December, the Indian troops killed 17 Kashmiris, and are 
now throwing even old Kashmiri leaders into jails. The Indian 
government just cannot justify its troops' bestial atrocities in 
Sopur. The fact is that India knows well that it cannot 
establish its rule even by allowing its hundreds of thousands of 
soldiers to commit atrocities against the people of Jammu and 
Kashmir. The Kashmiri people will get rid of the barbarous 
Indian occupation whenever they find an opportunity to do so, 
and they will succeed in their desire to join Pakistan. 
Therefore, in addition to trying to suppress their struggle 
through these abominable activities, it is also involved in 
their genocide in order to change the balance of the population 
so that it can establish its rule there. What is necessary in 
this situation is that Pakistan and other Islamic countries 
force India to stop its atrocities and give the Kashmiri people 
the right to autonomy according to UN resolutions. The Islamic 
world, however, is helpless, and Pakistan, without the support 
of the Islamic bloc, is not in a position to do anything. 
  India is aware of this weakness of Pakistan, and it is not 
willing to sway from its position of considering Kashmir an 
"integral part." Because of its open acts of inhumanity, the 
whole world has become concerned, and India's mask of secularism 
and peaceful designs have been removed. India stages its fake 
desire to hold talks just to fool the world and spoil the 
philosophical and ideological unity between Pakistanis and the 
Kashmiri people. It also raises slogans of decreasing tension 
between the two countries. Recently, when the Hazratbal shrine 
was taken over and the Kashmiri people succeeded in focusing the 
eyes of the world on the Kashmir issue, we expected that 
Pakistan, by presenting a resolution in the United Nations, 
would unmask India. There was a good possibility of this 
resolution being passed; however, India, through the United 
States, gave Pakistan the false hope of holding talks and 
stopped it from presenting the resolution. It also agreed to set 
aside 1 January for holding talks. However, India neither 
stopped the siege around the Hazrat Bal shrine nor did it stop 
committing atrocities against the Kashmiri people in order to 
establish atmosphere for bilateral talks. It did not decrease 
its propaganda against Pakistan, either; instead, it increased 
its activities against the Kashmiri people. The bloody incidents 
of Sopur also occurred after India's announcement that talks 
would be held. According to news reports, the Indian soldiers 
have started to drink alcohol in the Hazrat Bal shrine. 
  In such a situation, the people are not very hopeful, and 
the 
government will also lose hope for holding peace talks with 
India, keeping in mind India's record of backing out of its 
promises. The way India increased its atrocities in Kashmir 
after this announcement of talks was made, and Pakistan's 
decision to not introduce a resolution in the United Nations, 
causes us to expect an increase in tension between India and 
Pakistan after reconciliatory talks. That is what our experience 
tells us. According to some sources, India will also hold talks 
to discuss Wooler Barge and Siachen. It is true that Wooler 
Barge is situated in occupied Kashmir; however, both these 
issues are India's favorites, because a return of soldiers from 
Siachen would help reduce negative effects on India's economy. 
The construction of Wooler Barge is also beneficial to India. 
The talks that were held over Siachen at the secretary level 
have not produced anything. India has not followed up on its 
promises. We should make it clear that talks should be held over 
Kashmir first, and decisions should be made according to the UN 
resolution. Later, we can discuss Siachen and Wooler Barge. 
Therefore, the government, instead of being mislead, should be 
practical. It should not discourage the Kashmiri freedom 
fighters and the people by talking about peace discussions. A 
deputation of U. S. senators is coming to Pakistan under the 
leadership of Larry Pressler on 13 December. On the outside, 
they will be here to discuss the Pakistani nuclear program and 
the Pressler Amendment, however, the Kashmir issue will also be 
on their agenda. The change that occurred in the U.S. policy 
after Assistant Secretary of South Asia Robin Raphael's visit to 
this region recently calls for us to be on the alert. We hope it 
does not turn out that our "friend" pressures us again to make a 
decision in support of India. At present, in addition to India 
and the United States, our Foreign Ministry and the foreign 
minister are also "remembering" the Simla agreement. India's 
definition of the Simla agreement is not acceptable to Pakistan 
at all. Recently, by not introducing a resolution in the United 
Nations, we accepted the Indian definition. This means that the 
Kashmir issue cannot be raised in an international forum. We 
hope it does not happen that they make us sign some sort of 
Kashmir agreement at Camp David. By trusting our "friends," who 
have always been untrustworthy, we will lose again. Our friendly 
relations with Iran are above any suspicion. Iran's stand on the 
Kashmir issue is also very encouraging, but any talks about 
arbitration between the atrocious nation and the victim, and 
tyrants and the oppressed, are beyond our understanding. 
Therefore, our government, policy makers, and the bureaucrats in 
the Foreign Ministry should, instead of discussing any formulas 
for arbitration, increase their pressure for imposing economic 
restrictions against India and to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir. 
We should get the support of world opinion and awaken our 
Islamic brotherhood. We shall benefit from this, and that is our 
duty.

  [Text] Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Iranian 
spiritual leader Ayotallah Khamina met the other day and agreed 
that the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the UN 
resolution. In addition, they agreed that the Afghanistan, 
Palestine, and Bosnian issues should also be resolved according 
to the wishes of the people there. 
  The history of Pakistan and Iran's friendship is very old. 
In 
addition to Iran and Pakistan's social and religious 
relationship, they are good neighbors. Iran helped Pakistan in 
every difficult time. The people of Pakistan have not only 
praised their Iranian brothers, but have increased mutual 
relations with them. Especially after the Islamic revolution, 
led by religious leader Ayatollah Rohella Khomeini, Iran 
supported Pakistan on every critical occasion. Iran later had to 
fight a cold war after its revolution. The imperialist agents 
tried to throw obstructions in the path of Iran's revolution, 
and hurt Iran both politically and economically. Still, the 
Iranian government never hesitated to provide moral and material 
support to their Muslim brothers in Pakistan. Mr. Hoshemi 
Rafsanjani, the president of Iran, and spiritual leader 
Ayotallah Khamina have great love and respect for Pakistani 
Muslims, and have expressed it on several occasions. 
  Madam Benazir Bhutto said on arrival in Iran that it was her 
second home, and that she did not consider herself a foreigner 
there. That is why Madam Bhutto, in both her administrations, 
made visits to Iran her first priority. 
  During Madam Bhutto's recent visit to Iran, several 
agreements were signed between the Pakistani and Iranian 
governments. They also agreed to accelerate action on the 
agreements signed in the past. Iran has strongly condemned the 
Indian government over Kashmir, and has emphasized resolving 
this issue by providing self-government to the Muslims there. 
Iran expressed great concern over the atrocities being committed 
Muslims in India and other countries. The reaction that Iran's 
government expressed at the destruction of the Babri Masjid in 
India last year serves as a lesson to other Muslims. During the 
meeting between Benazir Bhutto and Ayatollah Khamina, the 
prayers delivered by the spiritual leader made the Pakistani 
people respect him and pray that the roots of the relationship 
between Pakistan and Iran become immortal in history.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Iran-Pakistan Declaration"] </F>
  [Text] Pakistan and Iran will increase defense cooperation. 
In addition, memoranda about the agreement for a joint gas 
pipeline between the two countries have also been signed. 
Members of the agreement expressed satisfaction at the 
cooperation between the two countries. In the joint communique 
released by the two countries, emphasis was placed on stopping 
the atrocities being committed on the people of Kashmir and on 
respecting human rights. They emphasized that the Kashmir issue 
be resolved according to the UN resolution. This communique 
strongly demanded that efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue be 
accelerated. The joint communique asked that the opposing groups 
in Afghanistan stop fighting. It accentuated the importance of 
lasting peace in the Middle East, as well as cooperation and 
agreement among Muslim religious leaders. 
  The joint communique from Iran and Pakistan is proof of past 
relations between the two countries. If we look at it within the 
framework of the present situation in the world it is very 
important, because the international situation at present shows 
a lot of unrest in the Islamic world because of the conspiracies 
of the Hindus and Jews against Muslims. The Indian atrocities in 
Kashmir, the massacre of Muslims in Bosnia, and the Jewish 
aggression against the Muslims in Palestine are problems which 
we can resolve by working together. 
  Wherever the Muslims live now, there are economic and social 
problems. The non-Muslims also have a monopoly over trade and 
commerce. From the perspective of resources, Muslims are not 
behind in any country; however, the disagreements and minor 
scuffles among the Pakistani nations, as well as the unnecessary 
confrontation, have stopped Islam from making an important place 
for itself in the world. Even today, if Muslim nations cooperate 
with each other in economic and social areas, no power in the 
world can insult them. 
  It is our misfortune that we have to depend on non-Muslims 
to 
obtain modern technology. If we sign mutual agreements for 
exchange of technology, then we will not have to look at anyone 
else. 
  Iran, after the 1979 Islamic revolution, started to use its 
own resources. Soon after this revolution, the imperialists 
forced a war on Iran. Still, after this long war, Iran managed 
to keep its economic and social conditions under control. All 
this happened because of its strong faith, which was helped by 
the grace of Allah. Imam Khomeini once said that neither the 
United States nor communism were superpowers; only God is the 
superpower. If we trust someone else, then our faith is weak. In 
light of Imam Khomeini's statement, Iran confronted a major 
superpower, which influenced politics worldwide. 
  It is a welcome development that the Muslim nations are also 
changing slowly, and that an atmosphere of mutual cooperation is 
increasing. This will help us to at least escape the control of 
foreigners. Relations between Pakistan and Iran for the last 
half century have prepared Pakistan to openly trust the Iranian 
Government and the people there. The people of Pakistan declare 
Iran their second home; similarly, our brothers in Iran consider 
Pakistan their second home. We pray the agreements made between 
the two countries will last until the end of the world, and that 
friendly relations between the governments and the people of 
Iran and Pakistan will never end.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Progress in Cooperation Among Pakistan, Iran, </F>
Turkey"] 
  [Text] When Madam Benazir Bhutto visited Turkey and Iran, 
she was very successful in achieving the goals for which she had 
come, according to observers. The joint communique issued by 
Iran and Pakistan before her departure for Turkey emphasized 
increasing cooperation between the two countries in areas of 
economics and the arts. The situation around Iran and Pakistan, 
including the Kashmir issue, the situation in Afghanistan, and 
the people's struggle in Azerbaijan, were also discussed in 
depth. Iran decided to offer special oil rates to Pakistan. 
Madam Bhutto started the second phase of her tour after this 
welcome support from Iranian leaders. Many agreements were 
signed during her stay in Turkey, and plans to increase 
cooperation in different areas were also discussed. Turkey 
agreed to open a bank in Pakistan for cooperation in economic 
areas. Relations between Pakistan and Turkey in commerce have 
always been good. Turkey has expressed a willingness to increase 
imports of rice and leather. Both countries have agreed to form 
a free zone for exports of goods to each other. Additionally, a 
joint committee will be established to discuss various plans. 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime Minister Madam 
Tansu Chahlar held bilateral talks about regional and 
international issues. The political cooperation between Turkey 
and Pakistan will help obtain Turkey's support for the struggle 
of Kashmiri Muslims. Madam Bhutto said in a statement that she 
was very impressed with the Turkish prime minister's 
decisiveness. She said that she considered the visit to Turkey a 
success because of the Turkish prime minister. The Turkish prime 
minister also said that she considered Benazir her sister. 
  Relations between Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey are based on 
several factors. In the past, these countries have had some 
agreements for regional development. The three countries have 
participated in communication and commerce agreements. Iran and 
Turkey have always helped their Pakistani brothers openly in war 
and peace. They have also supported Pakistan's principled stands 
in international forums. Even now, these three countries are 
cooperating with each other in religious, political, and 
economic areas. Pakistan was proud of its friendship with these 
two countries yesterday, is proud today, and will be proud 
tomorrow. The people of Pakistan have always been with their 
Iranian and Turkish brothers in good and bad times. The people 
of Pakistan are waiting for the response to the invitation given 
by the Pakistani prime minister to the Turkish prime minister 
and the Iranian president. We pray that relations among 
Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey improve day by day.

  [Text] Lahore (APP) -- Pakistan Muslim League (N) 
[PML-Nawaz] chief and leader of the opposition in the National 
Assembly Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif said here Wednesday [22 
December] that Pak-India talks in the prevailing situation would 
cause irreparable damage to the liberation struggle of Kashmiri 
mujahideen. 
  He said talks with New Delhi on the Kashmir issue could be 
meaningful only after the withdrawal of Indian forces from the 
held valley. 
  He pleaded that the Kashmiri mujahideen must be made a party 
in the dialogue. 
  Addressing a press conference here at his residence 
Wednesday 
evening, he said there was no justification for holding these 
talks at a time when Indian troops were shedding the blood of 
Kashmiris, their womenfolk were being gang-raped, houses were 
being burnt and their able bodied people were being put behind 
bars. 
  He said the secretary level talks with India was an attempt 
to sabotage the Kashmir Jehad. The Kashmiris were neither 
interested in these talks nor were they prepared to abide by the 
decision of such talks, he said. In such a situation, he said, 
this dialogue would be a futile attempt. 
  Nawaz said that while the Kashmiris were offering great 
sacrifices to liberate themselves from Indian slavery, the 
Pakistan government had withdrawn its resolution on Kashmir from 
the United Nations. 
  He alleged that the prime minister, Benazir Bhutto lacked 
commitment with the Kashmir issue and Pakistan's nuclear 
programme. He said the joint session of the parliament was held 
to discuss the Kashmir situation but during the week long 
session, the prime minister did not speak a single word on the 
issue nor was she present in the house during his (Nawaz's) 
speech. 
  He, however, said that no government could afford to ignore 
the sentiments of the masses on important national issues 
including that of Kashmir and the nuclear programme. 
  He said that whereas Pakistan was keen for these talks, 
Indian occupation troops in held Kashmir had stepped up their 
brutalities. He said the government must prevail upon New Delhi 
to stop the repression in held Kashmir before entering into 
dialogue. 
  Replying to a question, the PML chief said, any attempt to 
topple the present Azad Kashmir government at this juncture 
would be against the just cause of liberation of Kashmir. He 
said PML (N) would resist any such move with full force.

<F P=106> [Editorial: India-Pakistan Talks: The Atmosphere Is Not </F>
Improving; It Is Troubled"] 
  [Text] The Pakistani government has expressed grave concern 
about the increasing atrocities of the Indian troops in Kashmir 
and has asked friendly nations to help stop these atrocities and 
put pressure on India. It is important to create an atmosphere 
that is conducive to productive talks at the secretary's level, 
to start on 1 January. A spokesman of Pakistan's Foreign 
Ministry said during a routine briefing that the foreign 
secretary has informed diplomats from eastern Europe and Islamic 
countries about the situation in Kashmir and the Indian 
atrocities there. According to the spokesman, the government of 
Pakistan has warned India to stop the activities of RAW 
[Research and Analysis Wing (Intelligence Agency)] in Pakistan, 
because Pakistan and some neighboring nations have proof of its 
ugly activities. The spokesman further said that if India does 
not stop the campaign of disinformation against Pakistan, then 
Pakistan will unmask the activities of RAW. 
  India and Pakistan will have talks on Kashmir in Islamabad 
on 
1 January at the foreign secretary's level. The Pakistani 
government took back a resolution introduced in the United 
Nations about human rights violations in order to create a 
friendly atmosphere for these talks. According to the Pakistani 
government, some friendly nations have assured that India will 
be serious in these talks; however, the attitude the Indian 
government has taken does not give us much hope. India responded 
to Pakistan taking back the resolution from the United Nations 
with inhuman acts in Sopur and endless destruction in occupied 
Kashmir. Afterwards, India continued its shameful atrocities in 
occupied Kashmir. In Sopur alone, 150 people were killed and 20 
were wounded on 26 November. Over 400,000 Indian troops are 
already present in occupied Kashmir. Recently, East Punjab has 
sent fresh forces to the valley. The agents trained by the 
Israeli secret agency, Mosad, are creating havoc in Kashmir. 
  Pakistan has also taken notice of Indian intelligence agency 
RAW's instigative activities in Pakistan. The fact is that India 
is using RAW to spread chaos in Pakistan, especially in Sindh, 
in order to divert the attention of the world from the Kashmir 
issue and to spread fear and terrorism in Pakistan. Sindh is 
especially a target of RAW's activities. It is an open secret 
that some separatist elements in Sindh have a direct connection 
with RAW. The agents of RAW, dressed as robbers, encourage 
instigation and terrorism. India wants to create a situation 
similar to that of East Pakistan in Sindh. The communal and 
racial riots of Sindh were also encouraged by agents of RAW 
there. 
  Now the situation is such that the shameful atrocities in 
Kashmir are increased, the number of troops is augmented, help 
from Mosad is taken to crush the activities of Kashmiri freedom 
fighters, and India's intelligence agencies are active against 
Pakistan's freedom and unity. We cannot call all these 
activities sincere or the atmosphere friendly. Pakistan has 
informed the friendly nations about the atrocities being 
conducted against Kashmiris, especially those countries that 
have assured Pakistan that India will be serious in the next 
series of talks, has taken a very appropriate step. The 
government of Pakistan should also inform them about India's 
atrocities in Kashmir and RAW's activities in Pakistan, so that 
if no progress is made in these talks because of India's 
attitude, then India will not be able to accuse Pakistan. 
Instead, these countries will learn that it is India's attitude 
that is the major hindrance to making these negotiations 
successful.

  [Text] Islamabad -- The Kashmir issue was discussed Sunday 
in its exclusivity by the foreign secretaries of Pakistan and 
India during the first session of the seventh round of talks 
between the two countries. However, both sides hinted that no 
major progress was achieved and the differences remained wide 
even though the respective positions were made clear. 
  Pakistan and Indian diplomats remained tight-lipped about 
the 
first session of talks held on Sunday morning with Pakistan's 
Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan saying "no scores at half time" 
when asked for comments. His counterpart J N Dixit also parried 
questions telling newsmen that both the sides had presented 
their positions in a matter of fact style and that there were no 
acrimonious exchanges. More than that he would not say, he added. 
  Nearly all the participants of the talks from both sides 
were 
present at the reception hosted by the Indian High Commissioner 
S K Lamba in honour of Indian Foreign Secretary J N Dixit. 
Pakistani diplomats stressed that discussions with the Indian 
side were held with utmost seriousness in which their position 
was made crystal clear. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan, who 
avoided questions about the contents of the morning session, did 
say that the discussions were intensive and that Kashmir issue 
was the central point. Pakistani diplomats seemed happy that the 
Indians had discussed Kashmir issue thoroughly even though there 
were no indications that anything substantive had been achieved. 
  Some diplomats complained that media had hyped up the talks 
too much. And some hints were dropped that after Monday's 
session, the two sides may agree to hold more such rounds of 
talks without announcing specific dates. However, it was clear 
that side issues like Siachen, Sir Creek and Wullar Barrage were 
sidelined during the first session of talks. 
  The second session was held at 10 pm at the Foreign Office. 
Before that the Indian Foreign Secretary attended dinner hosted 
in his honour by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali. The 
third session will be held today at 9:10 am. 
  APP adds: Seventh round of Foreign Secretary-level talks 
between Pakistan and India, which began here on Sunday, focused 
on the Kashmir dispute with the two sides reiterating their 
stance on the issue. 
  Official sources here said that the negotiations started 
with 
a "note of seriousness." Pakistan called for creating requisite 
conditions for a peaceful solution of the Kashmir dispute. It 
emphasised the urgent need to end Indian repression in Occupied 
Kashmir to pave way for a peaceful settlement of the issue. 
  PPI adds: Calling upon India to create propitious conditions 
for finding out a peaceful Kashmir solution, Pakistan put across 
its known position on the issue during the first round of 
Foreign Secretary-level talks which began at 9:40 am and 
continued for 95 minutes. 
  The talks between the two countries at Foreign 
Secretary-level have resumed after a break of around 17 months 
for which both Islamabad and New Delhi have done a great deal of 
homework since the announcement in this respect during last week 
of November. 
  When contacted a Foreign Office spokesman told PPI that 
Pakistan also underlined the need for an end to repression in 
the Indian-held Kashmir to create propitious conditions for 
securing peaceful solution to the problem which is a sine qua 
non for the establishment of normal and cooperative relations 
between Pakistan and India. 
  The 7th round of talks between the two countries at the 
Foreign Secretary-level is of special significance for Pakistan 
mainly because of the fact that India has, for the first time, 
agreed to discuss the Kashmir question as a separate agenda item. 
  "The talks have so far focussed on the Kashmir issue," the 
spokesman said and added that during the first round, the two 
sides reiterated their known positions. 
  The Indian delegation is being led by Foreign Secretary J.N. 
Dixit and senior officials of Indian Ministry of External 
Affairs, including Joint Secretary M.K. Bhdra Kumar, Director 
Prakash Sood, Deputy Secretary Y.K. Sinha and Under-Secretary Ms 
Vijay Thakur Singh. The delegation was joined during the talks 
by officials of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad. 
  They include High Commissioner S.K. Lamba, Deputy High 
Commissioner Bal Anand, Francis Vaz and N. Parthasarthi. 
  The Pakistan delegation was headed by Foreign Secretary 
Shaharyar M. Khan. Additional Secretaries Munir Akram and 
Khalid Saleem, Director-General India Desk Shafqat Kakakhel, 
Directors Akberzeb and Jalil Abbas Jillani and Pakistan's High 
Commissioner in New Delhi Riaz Khokhar. 
  The spokesman said the talks started with a note of 
seriousness, adding that President of Pakistan and later the 
Foreign Secretary have both underlined Pakistan's desire for a 
peaceful solution of the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir on the 
basis of the United Nations resolutions. 
  Amidst hopes for constructive and meaningful talks, Pakistan 
has repeatedly announced during recent past that this is last 
chance for India. The Indian Foreign Secretary, however, 
disagreed with the announcement during his Saturday's Press 
talk, saying that he does not think this is a last chance. 
  PPI adds: The second round of Pak-India foreign secretary 
level talks was held here at the Foreign Office Sunday night, 
informed sources told PPI that during the second round which 
lasted half an hour, the two sides held indepth discussion 
focussing on all aspects of Jammu and Kashmir dispute. 
  Asked if the talks are heading towards a meaningful 
progress, 
the sources said, it would be premature to make any assessment 
with finality about the talks at this stage.

  [Article by Mariana Baahar] 
  [Text] Islamabad: Pakistan and India announced 
simultanously that there has been no breakthrough during talks 
on Kashmir at the conclusion of the seventh round of Foreign 
Secretary level meeting here on Monday afternoon. 
  The failure has led Islamabad to announced that as result it 
is not ready to schedule future talks with New Delhi though in 
principle it agrees that dialogue is the only answer to Kashmir. 
  This is indicated in the sketchy joint statement released to 
the media which appears as a mere formality but which Shaharyar 
M Khan described as a "step forward even though it was a small 
step". 
  "We are as far apart on the core issue (Kashmir) as we were 
earlier. Because of this divergence it is correct to say that on 
the central issue there has been no forward movement. We shall 
not schedule any talks at the Foreign Secretary or any other 
level unless there is a qualitative and visible change in 
Kashmir" commented a determined Shaharyar M Khan at the 
Islamabad Airport after seeing off his Indian counterpart J N 
Dixit. 
  The latter agreed when he said, "We are in the same position 
as we started. But it is not necessary to accomplish something 
for achievement. To say that there has been no accomplishment is 
a valued judgement". 
  In all nearly six hours were consumed in the four rounds 
between the two countries wherein both sides maintained their 
traditional stands. Official sources here described the talks as 
"those which in no way made any headway and nor did the Indian 
side give us andy assurances". They also maintained that 
Pakistan had a choice either to announce these parleys as a 
"failure" or to keep the option in its hand for the future. It 
opted for the latter which is indicated in the last paragraph of 
a joint statement which says that "the two sides will consult 
each other on the question of further talks at the Foreign 
Secretary or other level". 
  Earlier both Shaharyar and Dixit met with the media flanked 
by their two High Commissioners and senior officials of the 
Foreign Office, Shafqat Kakakhel and Munir Akram. 
  Dixit disclosed that he had held some preliminary discussion 
on some suggestions which both sides will now ponder over on how 
to proceed further with. 
  Shaharyar elaborated that in about two weeks time they 
(Indians) will come back to them on other outstanding issues 
like the Siachen Glacier, Wullar Barrage and Sir Creek. "We will 
look at the position papers but Pakistan's position is well 
known and we will now see the position adopted by India. We will 
take position after that", Shaharyar added. 
  The media was unprepared for the manner in which Dixit chose 
to reply to their queries. It is rare that the press is faced 
with such "diplomatic rudeness" in response to some very 
relevant questions. The Indian Foreign Secretary last his [words 
indistinct] when [words indistinct] Delhi's stand ond the UN 
Resolution on Kashmir. Earlier he had not elaborated on the 
issue except to say that: "Indian position on the relevance of 
the UN Resolution has been articulated more than once. The 
provocative question does not need an answer." 
  However Shaharyar made it a point to meet with the media 
once 
again after his Indian counterpart had left for home to 
elaborate Pakistan's point of view. Referring to the UN 
Resolution on Kashmir he said "I made it very clear that no 
matter how old the UN Resolutions are, they are as valid today 
as they were before. The same argument goes for the Simla 
Accord. If it has not led to any result one does not say that it 
cannot be applied. We are ready to discuss the modalities of the 
UN Resolution." 
  Dixit refused to come to terms with the conditions, that 
Pakistan insists are the Prerequisite for any meaningful 
dialogue on Kashmir. He felt. "We are aware of these four 
conditions. I conveyed to the Foreign Minister that when you are 
negotiating an intractabable problem you cannot do so without 
preconditions. "Source indicate that the Foreign Minister did 
not mince his words on his government's stand in his meeting 
with the visiting Secretary. 
  Shaharyar later said that for Pakistan the people of Kashmir 
are the "central players" and pointed out that Pakistan believed 
that everyone concerned at the Secretary level talks agreed with 
this. Dixit felt that "for any any political solution the people 
of Jammu and Kashmir would be taken into confidence." Shaharyar 
reiterated tht plebiscite was essential for the people of 
Kashmir. Dixit was informed that lowering of tensions meant that 
first the Kashmiri jailed leaders should be released. "People of 
Kashmir should be allowed to breathe and put across their point 
of view. We believe that as elsewhere the leadership should 
participate in their destiny", he said. 
  Shaharyar in the presence of Dixit maintained that Pakistan 
retained its option to table its resolution on human rights 
before UN which it had withheld so far. Dixit did not let this 
opportunity pass when he added, "the government and people of 
India are ready to live with the UN Resolution whether it is 
tabled or not." 
  Pakistan meanwhile still sees a silver lining in future 
talks 
as Shaharyar said, "as long as we can sit and talk the other 
dangers would recede."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Issue of Transit Facility for India"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told his 
Kazakh counterpart, Suleymanov, during a meeting that since we 
do not have any transit agreement with India, any caravan sent 
to India will not be allowed through Pakistan. These caravans 
only can go up to Karachi. India is Pakistan's eternal and 
ignoble enemy and it has never been lethargic or absentminded in 
harming Pakistan politically, economically, or diplomatically. 
Even now, it is punishing the Kashmiri Muslims only because they 
aspire for Pakistan and chant slogans of Long Live Pakistan. 
Given this situation, if Kazakhstan asks Pakistan for a transit 
facility to India, then we can only refuse it. The foreign 
minister rightly said that no such caravan can proceed to India 
through Pakistan. 
  The foreign minister and the present government may be asked 
to justify the agreement they signed with the Iranian Government 
for gas supply to India with a transit facility through 
Pakistan, which, according to reports received so far, was 
granted without any fee. How can an enemy country, and that too 
with which we do not have any transit agreement, be allowed to 
have a transit facility? We should reject any proposal, even if 
there is any possibility of earning some revenue by allowing the 
transit facility, because it is tantamount to helping the enemy. 
The nation justifiably is apprehensive and suspicious of this 
agreement. The opposition is creating an impression that there 
is something else [word indistinct] in the agreement. We do not 
think it wise to respect the wishes of a friendly country at the 
expense of our own interests. Will Iran allow Pakistan or any 
other country to use Iranian territory for providing any 
facility to an enemy? Why didn't the foreign minister adopt the 
same stand, which he did in the case of Kazakhstan, on Iran as 
well?

  [Text] Islamabad (PPI) -- A Foreign Office spokesman said 
here on Monday that the Pakistan-Afghanistan border has not been 
closed and it is open for those Afghan nationals, who are 
traveling on valid visas. Those people who want to come without 
any visa, however, will not be allowed to enter Pakistan. The 
spokesman added that seriously wounded persons have been allowed 
to enter Pakistan even without visas or other relevant documents. 
  The spokesman said Pakistan is cooperating with UN relief 
agencies to supply food and other relief materials to Afghan 
refugees in Jalalabad, and a big convoy carrying food and other 
materials will leave for Jalalabad on Tuesday. He disclosed 
that Pakistan will set up a hospital camp at Jalalabad to 
provide medical aid to those wounded in the battle. He added 
that Pakistan is providing every possible assistance to the 
Afghan refugees in Jalalabad. 
  The spokesman said that fighting is taking place only in 
Kabul; other areas are peaceful and, hence, the people wounded 
in Kabul can be moved to other areas for medical treatment. 
There is, therefore, no justification for opening the Pakistani 
border for Afghan nationals trying to enter the country without 
any visa. He said Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan has met 
the UN representative on Afghanistan and assured him of 
Pakistan's help in providing aid to Afghanistan. The foreign 
secretary has also met the high commissioner for Afghan refugees 
in this regard.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Sincere Call"] </F>
  [Text] The President of Pakistan Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan 
Leghari and King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia through a 
joint appeal have tried to invoke fear of God in the hearts of 
Afghan leaders who are locked in a senseless war against each 
other. Both the leaders have reminded Afghan leaders that the 
Islamabad accord was authenticated and reaffirmed in the 
precincts of holy Haram Sharif in the holy month of Ramadan and 
as such they should fear Allah for what they are doing to their 
own people. As a first step towards peace, both leaders have 
asked the Afghans to effect an immediate and unconditional 
ceasefire and then a allow the ICO [Islamic Conference 
Organization] and its secretary-general, as defined in the 
Makkah accord, to secure and monitor a permanent ceasefire 
leading to a comprehensive peace and stability in Afghanistan. 
The two leaders also discussed other issues and condemned 
atrocities being perpetrated in Kashmir and Bosnia. 
  The cry that in modern warfare no one is the winner does not 
seem to have reached Afghanistan where rival factions are still 
locked in bloody rocket-lobbing competition against each other 
-- former allies. One disturbing part of this warfare is that it 
is being repeated with religious punctuality. The Afghans who 
fought against the former Soviet Union in the name of religion 
are now hell bent upon damaging their religious credentials. The 
ground realities of Afghanistan do not leave much space for any 
optimistic hope. Today's Afghanistan resembles Lebanon with 
different forces controlling different parts of the country and 
no one ready to tolerate the other. Lacking democratic 
traditions, any difference of opinion among them quickly 
disintegrates into a bloody battle due to free availability of 
arms. The Afghans don't even accept the Loya Jirga because it 
would be a nominated one. They see the UN as a stooge of the 
United States. The ICO is being kept at bay by periodic battles. 
The only solution under the circumstances is continued dialogue 
among themselves in a congenial atmosphere. They have to shed 
their narrow, selfish motives and sectarian or ideological 
emotions. The Afghan leaders have to show special tolerance and 
stop feeding their followers on war-propaganda so that some 
common ground is found in a vertically polarised society. It is 
high time the Afghans realised the mistake they are committing 
by indulging in internecine warfare. Friendly countries are 
there to help them sort out their differences so that peace 
returns to their country. Let them heed the sincere call made by 
President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz 
and stop spilling each other's blood.

<F P=106> [Article by Khwaja Javed Ahmed: "Murtaza Bhutto's Arrival </F>
Can Vitalize Politics"] 
  [Text] In Sindh, especially the areas around river banks in 
outer districts such as Sakkhar, Larkana, Naushahroferoz, and 
Khairpur, robbers and organized kidnapping groups have created 
new problems for the farmers and other residents of villages 
around the national highways and near the jungles. If this 
problem is not rectified soon, then all the great goals set by 
the new government for its political, economic, and 
administrative areas will be left unfulfilled. Last week, as a 
result of the organized attacks by these robbers and antisocial 
elements, 15 people were killed, 30 were kidnapped, and over 20 
were wounded. In a face-to-face confrontation between the joint 
forces of the police and the military and the robbers in the 
Andal Sunderani jungle, a large amount of modern automatic 
weapons was recovered. One robber, Sidhauru, was killed in this 
confrontation. This robber carried a reward of one million 
rupees in Sindh and Punjab for his arrest. For the last few 
months it seems that such alertness was never seen among the 
police and the agencies responsible for maintaining law and 
order. In addition to taking immediate steps against robbers and 
instigators, the government must take action to make the 
administration and police more effective. The innocent people in 
the villages cannot face the robbers with their automatic 
weapons. In addition to an increase in the number of crimes, 
incidents of whole busloads of tourists being kidnapped are 
taking place, which are scaring the people. 
  The Elections Commission has declared the presidential 
elections, and the two prominent national parties have started a 
new campaign to elect a president for the next five years. This 
campaign will reach its climax on 13 November. Even though the 
names of prominent national leaders as possible candidates have 
already been published, we must remember that Air Marshal Asghar 
Khan, chairman of Tehriq-i Istiqlal (TI), announced at the 
beginning of the year his candidacy for this office. At that 
time, his party was part of the PDA [People's Democratic 
Alliance], and he was very friendly with the PPP [Pakistan 
People's Party]. The National Council of the TI had made this 
decision, which according to M.Y.R. Bhatti, member of the 
council and president of Sakkhar TI, was irrevocable. When this 
decision was made the TI had strongly expected that the PPP, 
because of its close relationship with it, would help it against 
Ghulam Ishaq Khan. At that time, Nawaz Sharif and Ghulam were 
together, and Benazir Bhutto was challenging them from afar. It 
does not take much time for politics to change, and now Asghar 
Khan and Benazir Bhutto are at "two different poles." It appears 
that the PPP will bring in a new presidential candidate, as per 
Ghulam Ishaq Khan's advice and help. It is also possible that 
the party brings in Ghulam Ishaq Khan as its candidate as its 
last trump card. According to political observers, since the 
general elections were held under a package deal with the armed 
forces, and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had agreed to 
dismiss the National Assembly just to meet the ceremonial 
requirement, and he had asked that Ghulam Ishaq Khan should also 
resign from his position along with him. Thus, when they both 
resigned, the former caretaker prime minister, Mueen Qureshi, 
was appointed to his position. 
  The way Nawaz Sharif assassinated Ghulam Ishaq Khan's 
character at the national and international levels referring to 
his service as a finance minister, chairman of the WAPDA [Water 
and Power Development Authority], secretary general of the 
Pakistani government, chairman of the Senate, and later, as 
president, has helped him a lot in Punjab and other areas during 
the election campaign. Even though many people had insisted that 
Ghulam Ishaq Khan provide ammunition to Benazir's election 
campaign with his exposures and statements, the former president 
refused to oblige. He believed that this would only hurt 
Benazir's campaign. Ghulam Ishaq Khan wanted to make sure that 
Nawaz Sharif did not get into power again. Thus, he must have 
noted that Benazir Bhutto, right after taking the oath of the 
position of prime minister, visited Peshawar the same night. She 
stayed at the governor's house, but did not visit Ghulam Ishaq 
Khan, who was staying in the government rest house just a few 
steps away. Only former caretaker Prime Minister Balakh Sher 
Mazari visited Ghulam Ishaq Khan alone. According to observers, 
Benazir Bhutto has emerged to power as a wiser and more tolerant 
politician, and she does not want to take the risk of nominating 
Ghulam Ishaq Khan as the president. 
  It is a welcome development that the prime minister and the 
opposition leader have assured solid and unconditional 
cooperation between their respective parliamentary groups. 
However, the persons who met with her in Peshawar on the night 
she took oath of her office, and advised her to vote for Aftab 
Ahmed Khan Sherpao, were responsible for a despicable action. 
Result of such an action will not be in favor of the PPP. 
  There have been negative effects of the boycott of the 
National Assembly by the MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement]. Sindh's 
chief minister, Sayyed Abdullah Shah, and the prime minister 
herself had promised the Urdu-speaking groups without 
identifying any ethnicity. Still, the MQM (Iltaf) leaders insist 
that election in urban areas of Sindh should be held all over 
again. They also want the operation against the MQM to be 
stopped. Mr. Naim Siddiqi, the MQM's Sakkhar zone organizer, has 
also challenged the elections held in Sakkhar P.S. 6. He lost 
here by 2,000 votes. Meanwhile, the Jamaat-i Islami Pakistan has 
started "to take turns" after the recent meeting of its central 
committee. One of its leaders, as well as former leader Mian 
Tufail Mohammed, has resigned from the central committee. Dr. 
Atahar Qureshi, secretary general of Sindh, told the journalists 
in Sakkhar that if a better candidate than Nawaz Sharif is 
available, then the Jamaat-i Islami will review its former 
policy and cooperate in the greater interest of the country. 
According to him, the country and Islam will never compromise on 
these two issues, and all parties can cooperate over it. 
  According to inner political circles, the PPP will have a 
very difficult time, both at the federal and state levels, in 
establishing its governments. The party leaders do not have to 
only keep their party members, but also independent members, 
with them. The arrival of Murtaza Bhutto in Sindh could also 
cause a lot of problems in a few days, because the ideological 
and serious workers of the party had a lot of reservations when 
deciding between Benazir Bhutto and Murtaza Bhutto. Even though 
Murtaza Bhutto ran for election from his father's platform, 
sooner or later, he will claim the party leadership, because, 
according to Sindh's culture and tradition, he is to inherit the 
political tradition of his father. It appears that his honorable 
mother is willing to relinquish her position to make him the 
party chairman, and to let Benazir be the prime minister. 
According to PPP bylaws, the party and government positions 
should be kept separate. The nationalist elements in Sindh and 
the hardliners (including Qadir Majsi, Mumtaz Bhutto, and G. M. 
Syed) need to be balanced. These group people and the agencies 
are paving the way for Murtaza Bhutto's return behind the 
scenes. They believe that Murtaza Bhutto can play a very 
important role in the country's politics in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Aftab Ali: "Murtaza Bhutto's Political Position </F>
and Public Support"] 
  [Text] Dear readers, there are workers of the PPP [Pakistan 
People's Party] among you, and there are those who support the 
People's Party. Some of you are followers, and some of you who 
oppose it are also readers of the daily MUSAWAT. Therefore, an 
issue that requires a lot of contemplation is being presented to 
you all men and women. You will remember that until the fall of 
the Nawaz Sharif government, for about 14 years, the late Mr. 
Bhutto's son, Murtaza Bhutto, was declared responsible for about 
90 percent of all terrorist activities, as the founder and 
leader of the al-Zulfiqar organization. All efforts were made to 
accuse Murtaza Bhutto and the al-Zulfiqar organization of every 
political assassination, relentless firing incident, and bomb 
blast. In this context, the so-called independent communications 
media also played a condemnable role, and declared Murtaza 
Bhutto, the founder of a terrorist organization, al-Zulfiqar, a 
dangerous traitor and enemy of society. Some of them tried to 
prove all this, and, at times, they accused Madam Benazir Bhutto 
of protecting al-Zulfiqar. Madam Bhutto has always denied this, 
and has expressed her contempt for violence in politics. The 
communications media always presented the activities of the 
so-called al-Zulfiqar with large headings and in several 
columns. When news about the denial of such efforts was made 
available, and those PPP members were honorably acquitted by the 
court, they were published in the newspaper in an obscure 
manner. Now this same communications media and bureaucracy are 
going through a revolutionary change. The communications media 
that was always in the forefront for assassinating Murtaza 
Bhutto's character is publishing news even when Murtaza Bhutto 
sneezes, as if it has been a heavy blow to the nation. After 
all, Murtaza Bhutto is the son of the martyred Bhutto. He is 
also Nusrat Bhutto's son and Madam Benazir Bhutto's brother. 
Now, even news about the laughing and crying of his wife, Ghanui 
Murtaza, and his son, Zulfiqar Murtaza, are being printed on the 
front page. We can say to the media about this sudden change: 
"Oh, camel, do you have any part of your body straight?" 
However, just presenting this proverb is not enough. This is a 
very deep and dangerous game, and many masked players are 
involved in it. These are the same elements that have always 
tried to destroy the PPP and have wanted to topple its national 
position, so that they could gain their group and personal 
interests. They wanted to destroy this party totally. At first, 
they targeted this party and its leaders using al-Zulfiqar, and 
when all their illegal efforts failed to end the party's unity 
and national status, they declared the party to be controlled by 
a dynasty. They still failed. They then declared this a party of 
Sindh and the Sindhi people. The unity of the party workers all 
over the country did not allow them to succeed in their efforts. 
Those same faces want to play the same dangerous game in the 
name of Murtaza Bhutto. The readers must remember that Nawaz 
Sharif used to target Murtaza Bhutto in his meetings in Punjab. 
He used to repeat the accusations levied against him, and try to 
prove that Benazir Bhutto was politically associated with 
Murtaza Bhutto, in order to hurt Benazir's position in Punjab. 
He also declared Murtaza Bhutto an enemy of the country. At the 
same time, when he would go to Sindh, he asked Murtaza Bhutto's 
uncle, Mumtaz Bhutto, for cooperation and agreement. He also 
announced starting of Murtaza Bhutto's election campaign. Even 
before the government had taken back its accusations against 
Mumtaz Bhutto, his identity card was issued, and at the same 
time, his nomination papers were approved. The late Mr. Bhutto's 
election symbol, "a fist," was also given to him. Dear readers, 
we do not mind Murtaza Bhutto's return to the country, his 
running for election, or the fact that he has formed a separate 
committee with a separate symbol. These are all good things. 
Murtaza Bhutto has the right to return to Pakistan, and as a 
Pakistani, he has the right to run for election. He also has the 
right to form a separate organization. However, Murtaza Bhutto 
has not decided how to use all these rights, and who will 
cooperate with him now. Have not these people opposed his 
father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, in the past? Have not they been 
involved in a dangerous conspiracy against Benazir Bhutto and 
his father's party? We are sure that this has happened 
continuously, and this is evident from Murtaza Bhutto's actions. 
For example, Mumtaz Bhutto has separated from his supporter, 
Sabak Majid, and entered the political arena. Sabak Majid was a 
spokesperson for the party's bitter enemy, Jam-i Sadiq Ali and 
was almost a "martyr" in his anti-Benazir efforts. He did not 
even get a taste of a false case against him, as Benazir Bhutto, 
her associates and supporters, and her husband, Aasif Zardari, 
did. Some of them had to suffer in jails and be separated from 
their children and wives. All these are important instruments 
for strengthening a nation's foundation. Let us think for a 
second. Mir Murtaza Bhutto is elected from two National Assembly 
election districts and six or seven state election districts. 
(This is not possible, though.) The first thing to note here is 
that he will have to give up either the national or the state 
assembly membership. He will have to resign from all the state 
assemblies he is elected to and keep one National Assembly seat. 
This way, by representing Murtaza, he will not only act against 
Benazir, but also fulfill his efforts of 14 years against 
Murtaza's late father's party. Second, Mumtaz Bhutto is a 
non-political person, whose non-political and irresponsible 
actions made the citizens of Sindh hate the PPP. Because of his 
non-political actions, the PNA [Pakistan National Alliance] 
campaign in Sindh emerged against the late Mr. Bhutto. In 
addition, after having Mr. Bhutto hanged, Mumtaz Bhutto showed 
his deplorable and condemnable cowardice by becoming quiet. In 
other words, he established a front to sabotage Bhuttoism. 
Finally, we would like to request that Mir Murtaza Bhutto, if he 
is elected or loses the election in his political effort, 
through the people's support or lack thereof, must do his 
political duty. Dear readers, you and I know that Murtaza Bhutto 
is the son of the late Mr. Bhutto and Mrs. Nusrat Bhutto, and is 
Benazir Bhutto's brother. He had been leading a life of 
self-imposed exile for a long time. His politics have been the 
politics of crooks. Therefore, instead of popular support, he 
has the support of a group only. Second, the former governments 
had always given him bad publicity. Therefore, he failed to get 
popular support. He had not done any public service. All he did 
was impose exile on himself, and had one member or another of 
his Shaheed Committee run for the National Assembly. In this 
situation, Murtaza Bhutto should consider that if he wins two 
seats, then he will either be a rolling stone in the National 
Assembly, will play the role of a second-class politician, or 
will become the victim of horse-trading. He will be unable to 
form an important role for himself. He will always have the 
opposition of the members of his late father's party, because he 
will be running against them. The second fact is that if he 
gives up his seat in the National Assembly and maintains a seat 
in the state assembly, even if six or seven other seats remain 
with his supporters, then Mir Murtaza Bhutto should ask himself: 
"In this large house, if the other party has the majority, will 
I sit with the opposition party?" Just like other pro-MQM 
[Muhajir Qaumi Movement] people, where every party has two or 
four members, will he also become a toy in the hands of the MQM 
or the Nawaz group with his seven members? That is what happened 
to Jam-i Sadiq, Muzaffer Shah, and the Jatoi groups in the past. 
He must think about all the facts and find out if he would be 
able to play a clear and important political role in this 
situation. In our opinion, first of all, whether or not he runs 
for election, and whether he wins or loses, he should request 
that the courts pardon all the cases against him. After he is 
excused from all these accusations, he should then come to the 
people. He should work toward providing stability to the 
government, and should serve the nation and the people, as his 
martyred father wanted. He should cooperate with his sister, 
Benazir Bhutto. He should free himself from such nonpolitical 
people as Mumtaz Bhutto and corrupt people like Sabaq Majid. If, 
after Benazir relinquishes politics, he wants to lead the party 
in the future, then he should first work as a party member. He 
should establish his place in the party. He should get out of 
corrupt politics, and should think about the nation, the people, 
and the world. He should adopt moderation and prudence in his 
politics. All this can be attained. He should attain it when he 
gives up the Shaheed Committee and joins the party of the 
martyr. He should give up the symbol of "fist" and take up the 
symbol of the "arrow," because an arrow has a much farther reach 
than a fist.

  [Text] According to a report published in a Lahore Urdu 
newspaper, General Termazi, the leader of the special task force 
appointed by the government, has sent to the prime minister a 
list of 160 international drug smugglers. The majority are 
individuals who play central roles in Pakistani politics. 
According to sources, the prime minister has instructed General 
Termazi to place these "big fish" under immediate arrest and 
bring them to trial in the high courts. Reportedly General 
Termazi has met with high officials and informed them of the 
situation. Meanwhile, as a result of the activities of the 
Special Task Force, the owners of heroin factories on the Toor 
Kham Kabul border are selling their heroin at cheap prices. Most 
well-known heroin dealers have moved their factories and 
themselves to Afghanistan in order to stay out of the reach of 
the Task Force. According to informed sources, Ayub Afridi, the 
king of drugs, is sending all his furniture to Switzerland, and 
has gone into hiding. Ayub Afridi is wanted by Interpol in 
several drug smuggling cases. Several other drug dealers, some 
of whom are women who observe purdah [veil], have ordered their 
agents to cease operations and to go underground temporarily. It 
has also been learned that, in its initial activity, the Task 
Force arrested a number of agents working for drug sellers, and 
is interrogating them in secret locations.

<F P=106> [Article by Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem: "Defeat of Religious </F>
Parties: Other Reasons"] 
  [Text] The defeat of religious parties in the October 1993 
election has given birth to a new debate. Some people are openly 
expressing the opinion that Islam is not an effective partner in 
our politics anymore. Some circles oppose this opinion, and 
various persons have expressed all kinds of reasonings about it. 
Those who want to see Pakistan a secular nation are inferring 
from the election results that since the people have not voted 
for the people that use the name of Islam, it is definite that 
the majority of the people are not willing to include religion 
in their political affairs. Therefore, our national and 
political party systems should be taken care of in such a way 
that religion is not involved in them. 
  The way the analysts in the newspaper are viewing the defeat 
of the religious parties clearly indicates their superficiality. 
A few days ago a prominent columnist in an English newspaper, in 
discussing the reasons for the Islamic Front's defeat, wrote 
that the election program Qazi Hussein Ahmed espoused in his 
campaign had strongly condemned the landlord system. Before it, 
the founder of the Jamaat-i Islami showed his support of the 
landlord system in his book, "The Problem of Land Ownership." 
Qazi Ahmed should have removed that book from his list of 
literature before he condemned the landlords. Since he did not 
do so, there were some conflicts present. The people were not 
willing to vote for the Islamic Front. Let us analyze this 
commentary. Ninety percent of the voters in this country are 
unaware that Maulana Maududi has written: "The Problem of Land 
Ownership." Even if some are aware of this book, very few have 
read it. Now let us set aside this book for a while, and say 
that Maulana Maududi wrote in this book what he wanted to write. 
Let us consider how much this commentary relates to the facts. 
It is the habit of commentators to only look at a few point and 
write page after page about it. They do not try to find facts 
that have been decisive in this country's politics. They saw 
that only seven percent of the people voted for the religious 
parties, and therefore, it means that we should exile Islam from 
Pakistan's politics. 
  In our opinion, this is the desire of only a few people. 
Islam is still present as an important force in this country, 
just as it has been in the past. In the October election, the 
people did not vote for the religious parties. There are some 
reasons for this, and I am trying to explain those in these 
lines. 
  It is a known fact that elections in Pakistan are not based 
on any ideology, philosophy, or system. If the people have 
elected a person or a party, then they have not done so because 
of their association with a specific ideology. They always had 
different reasons. For example, when the PPP [Pakistan People's 
Party] got a majority vote in the 1970 election, it was not 
because the people had supported socialism against Islam. Those 
who keep an eye on the country's social and economic conditions 
know that 80 percent of this country's population lives in rural 
areas. It is their opinion that is decisive in election results. 
Generally, politics is divided into two groups in rural areas. 
This politics is based on the police station and the court. 
Mutual misunderstandings and disagreement over land are the 
problems that top the list of the problems that the rural people 
usually face. If some people have a disagreement in a village, 
then the political bigwigs in the region stand behind them, and 
the person with more influence in the police station or the 
court succeeds in getting his way. In order to influence the 
government, these people need the support of the administration. 
Therefore, they always try to stay on the good side of the 
government. If we paid attention, we would know that this is the 
basic reason that our politics has been introduced to "lotaism" 
[a form of nepotism]. The leaders who had influence in their 
districts in the 1970s joined the PPP. When the PPP won the 
majority, a large number of independent candidates also joined 
the ruling party because it was important for their political 
survival. Those who opposed them became weak, because they did 
not have the support of the government. 
  When martial law was implemented in 1977, and General Ziaul 
Haq's administration was established, he needed political 
support to establish his credibility among the people. Thus, the 
politicians who opposed the PPP gathered under the umbrella of 
the new government. They joined the "shura" of Ziaul Haq and 
started to establish their political clout from that time. The 
police station and SHOs [Station House Officer (police)] who 
worked on the order of the PPP before began to obey them now. 
These people were elected in large numbers during the 1985 
nonparty elections. Later, they were put together and labeled 
the Muslim League Party. When the PPP government returned to the 
Center in 1988, it started to strengthen its members, because 
the state government in Punjab was headed by Nawaz Sharif. He 
was controlling the police stations there. Since the PPP had the 
government at the Center, the people associated with it survived 
politically. The balance of power was almost equal at that time. 
  In 1990, both groups received an almost equal number of 
votes. The Islami Jamhuri Ittehad (IJI) received 54 percent of 
the vote, and the situation in 1983 was almost the same. All in 
all, the Muslim League has a one percent majority. This was the 
situation in Punjab. In the rural and urban areas of Sindh, the 
situation remained the same as in the past. The tribal chiefs 
won in Balochistan. The people of Sarhad were always close to 
religion, or the political parties had some illusion about it. 
If we look at it in light of this analysis, it is clear that 
religion and ideology are not playing any part in the election. 
It is clear that our political tradition of the last half 
century, over which this country was established, is divided 
into two groups. It is true that the actions, foreign policy, 
and ideologies of the former governments play an important role 
in urban areas. The Jamaat-i Islami had a very good position in 
urban areas in the past; however, these majorities went to Iltaf 
Hussein in Karachi and to Nawaz Sharif in Punjab. In Karachi, 
the people are getting out of this habit to an extent; however, 
it will take some time in Punjab. People will learn after a 
while which ideology did the PPP subscribe to, and based on 
which they hated it. Nawaz Sharif and his political allies are 
not sincere enough about their ideology to make him their 
permanent leader. 
  Based on this analysis, I am of the opinion that Islam does 
not play any effective role in our politics, and the reason for 
this is not that our association with Islam is weak; it is 
because of the division of our politics into these two groups. 
This division is based on vested interests and mutual 
association. Qazi Hussein Ahmed tried, through the Islamic 
Front, to get people out of this division, and to make 
character, ideology, and relationship with the nation the basis 
for votes. However, even after admitting the truth about these 
qualities, it is difficult to destroy the statues of vested 
interests and mutual associations. Still, it is a fact that when 
a group accepts a specific ideology, no power in the world can 
stop it from realizing it. After the fall of communism, the 
world has divided into secular and religious blocs. I assume 
that the next election in Pakistan will be between two groups, 
but these groups will be different from today's. The next 
division will not be based on vested interests, brotherhood, 
land ownership, or capital; they will be based on ideology, 
character, political programs, and patriotism. It is important 
that the candidates who will base their politics in ideology, 
character, and political program should take part as actively as 
the politicians who run politics of brotherhood, vested 
interests, and landownership. If they threw in their towels 
after this defeat and retired to holy places and private rooms, 
then our hopes will not be fulfilled and our nation will suffer 
in this sham struggle.

<F P=106> [Article by Saeed Qaisar Rizvi: "Will the New Government Be </F>
Able To Take All-Out Action Against Drug Smugglers?"] 
  [Text] A major political assassination took place during 
the election campaign. God alone knows if the assassination was 
intended to postpone the elections or whether it was caused by 
personal enmity. At any rate, the general impression is that the 
individual who was murdered did not have bitter personal 
enemies, but, even so, he was not spared. It is hard to 
understand the merciless fashion in which he was shot. The 
government resorted to the usual phrases and comforted the 
family with the promise that the murderers would not be allowed 
to go free under any circumstances. The problem here is that the 
murderers will have to be caught first; otherwise, the question 
of letting them go free does not arise at all. In Peshawar 
memorial prayers were held for the late Ghulam Haidar Wain 
[though the funeral was held elsewhere] in which large numbers 
of people from various political parties took part. Black arm 
bands were worn, and the people expressed their dissatisfaction. 
But a few minutes later, life resumed its normal course as 
though nothing unusual had happened. This time one sees strange 
election scenes in Peshawar. In certain precincts, posters are 
being displayed against certain candidates telling them not to 
come to that locality because they had not carried out any of 
their campaign promises. Except for a few precincts where new 
candidates have entered the arena and created some activity, the 
election campaign generally has not been very animated in the 
Northwest Frontier Province. As regards election holidays, most 
people have decided to spend the time away from their homes. 
School and college vacations have started. To give the finishing 
touches to the election program, large meetings were held in 
Peshawar's Jinnah Park and political parties demonstrated their 
strength. Local residents did not take any major part in these 
meetings, but people were brought from outside in buses, 
trollies, and trucks. The first large meeting was held by Qazi 
Hussain Ahmad's Islamic Front followed by Benazir Bhutto and 
Mian Nawaz Sharif. The people were given time to think. A day 
earlier, Qazi Hussain Ahmad addressed a large gathering in 
Mardan in which he accused the People's Party and the Muslim 
League of being gangs of thieves and plunderers with identical 
aims. It should be remembered that when this same Qazi Hussain 
Ahmad joined the IJI [Islami Jamhoori Ittehad], he declared that 
the Urdu meaning of the Muslim League was Jamiat-I-Islami and 
that both parties had the same basic characteristics. At any 
rate, it cannot be denied even today that when the war for 
Pakistan was being fought, Jamaat-I-Islami was the largest 
opposing party [sic]. Qazi Hussain Ahmad said that both Nawaz 
Sharif and Benazir Bhutto were trying to outdo each other in 
currying favor with the U. S., that both supported the 
capitalist usury system under the aegis of the U. S., and that 
they had joined Moin Qureshi with the intention of mortgaging 
Pakistan totally to the U. S.. It should be remembered that Qazi 
Hussain Ahmad is running for election in Malakand, and he has 
made campaign speeches in various places there. He pointed out 
that disorder, murder, theft, and plunder were increasing daily 
and no one's life or property were safe which proved clearly 
that both the past two governments and the present caretaker 
government had failed. He said that corruption had continued to 
increase under the Benazir and Nawaz governments up to the 
present time and the reason was that the precepts of the Koran 
and the hadith were ignored. He said that the Islamic Front 
would end injustice, disorder, and oppression in the country and 
establish a beneficial social order under the leadership of 
honest individulas, and that, in order to put an end to 
oppression, the people should join the Islamic Front and 
confront plunderers and feudal landlords and thus prevent the 
old ruling class from regaining power and strengthening the 
Western system instead of Islam. Qazi Hussain Ahmad said that 
certain individuals accepted the United States as the sole 
superpower and tried to scare the Islamic Front, but that the 
latter was sure that soon the United States would suffer the 
same fate as the Soviet Union, a fate which everyone had 
witnessed. He said the struggle of the Islamic Front was not 
against Benazir, Nawaz Sharif or Wali Khan, but against the 
United States and its exploitative capitalist system and the 
supporters of that system. On the whole, the Islamic Front will 
not succeed in gaining more than five national assembly seats 
from the entire Northwest Frontier Province. 
  Meanwhile, the big fish of the drug business were suddenly 
arrested in three MPOs and put in the Frontier Province's large 
jails. Our readers have read about them here, and we have been 
informing them about the [activities] of these enemies of 
humanity. We have been receiving letters from inside and outside 
the country complaining that we were not writing enough against 
these elements. One of these letters is from Mr. Manzoor who has 
written us from Norway. While governments and officials now and 
then proclaim their strength, the fact remains that these 
elements [drug dealers] have set up shadow governments in almost 
every part of the world, and it is quite easy for them to wipe 
out humanity from the face of the earth. Even today, there are 
individuals including members of legislative bodies who are 
engaged in drug dealing, but the government is powerless to 
bring them to justice. A former minister and major drug dealer, 
Amanullah Kandi, was convicted in a Karachi court, but to this 
day it is not clear how he was transferred from Karachi jail to 
the central jail of Dera Ismail Khan, his native town, and who 
had a hand in helping him escape from that prison. Recently, a 
journalist went to interview him, but the journalist's camera 
and the tape of the interview were confiscated by government 
officials. In spite of strong reassurances by the government, 
[Kandi] has eluded capture. Meanwhile, Peshawar high court's 
full bench has thrown out the appeal entered against the 
disqualification of Rahnuma Nadir Khan Zaka Kheel running 
against National Assembly Speaker Gauhar Ayub Khan from Haripur 
precinct NA13, and the disqualification of Mehmand Agency's Haji 
Qadar Gul Mehmand (former MNA) accused of drug dealing, and of 
Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan. These individuals had been 
barred from participating in the elections by the returning 
officials and later by the election appellate tribunal. Haji 
Qadar Gul Mehmand and Haji Ibrahim Khan were arrested by the 
local police on charge of selling drugs and these two 
individuals are still in jail. The full bench consisted of 
justice Abdul Karim Kandi; justice Sayed Ibni Ali; justice Abdul 
Rahman Khan; justice Khiar Khan and justice Mian Mohammad Ajmal. 
The candidacy papers filed by petitioner Sayed Sultan Shah were 
rejected because he did not pay the money owed. 
  The [candidacy] papers of Nadir Khan Zakha Kheel who was a 
candidate for the national assembly from Khyber Agency were 
rejected on grounds that he had fought against government 
officials during construction of Qamar road in Tirah and had 
harmed national security; he was barred from running in the 
elections. National Assembly hopeful from Mehmand Agency, Haji 
Qadar Gul Mehmand and Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan, who 
were charged with drug dealing, had their papers rejected and 
were barred from participation in the elections. The two men 
were arrested by the local police, and they are still in jail. 
Following the rejection of their election petitions, these two 
individuals appealed to the election tribunal, but their appeal 
was also rejected. They entered four separate writs in the 
Peshawar high court against the tribunal's decision barring them 
from election participation. On Thursday, the high court's full 
bench rejected their writs. These candidates cannot take part in 
the elections. The attorney general of Pakistan, who prosecuted 
the case for the government, took the position that elections 
did not merely imply voting on a certain date but were a gradual 
process in which it was necessary to file candidacy papers, 
assign election symbols, qualify or disqualified candidates to 
run. The attorney general said that the election tribunal had 
decided as to whether these individuals were qualified or not. 
After elections took place under article 225 of the 
constitution, these individuals could challenge their 
disqualification in the next election tribunal. Consequently, it 
was not within the jurisdiction of the court to hear the 
petitions of these individuals. Referring to the 1989 Javid 
Hashemi case in the Pakistan Supreme Court, the attorney general 
said that the Supreme Court had rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal 
and instructed him to take his case to the election tribunal 
after elections were over. Lawyers for petitioners Haji Ibrahim 
Khan and Nadir Khan Zakha Kheel raised the point that at that 
time Supreme Court Justice Naseem Hasan Shah's decision was 
contrary to the decisions of the rest of the justices. At this 
juncture, the chief justice said that the majority of the 
Supreme Court justices had rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal. 
Justice Nasim Hasan Shah said if the majority agreed on a 
decision, he would go along with it. The attorney general 
pointed out that the Sindh High Court had made a similar 
decision in the Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi case and ruled that the 
high court did not have the jurisdiction to hear Jatoi's appeal 
and that the decision could be challenged in the election 
tribunal to be set up after the elections. Haji Qadar Gul's 
lawyer said that his client's langi had been revoked. Langi is 
an honor awarded to certain prominent individuals in the 
agencies and is usually given to those favored by the 
government.

<F P=106> [Article by Khalil Malik: "Changing Role of Minorities"] </F>
  [Text] From the perspective of maintaining airplanes, the 
Indian Air Force is considered the world's worst military unit. 
Its Soviet-made MIG planes are involved in so many accidents 
that the Indian pilots call them flying coffins. In contrast, 
the standards and safety of Pakistan's Air Force have long been 
regarded as one of the world's most efficient. During the last 
few years, the number of accidents in the Pakistan Air Force has 
also increased (The latest accident occurred a few days ago, 
when a Chinese-made airplane fell in a canal). When the series 
of accidents in our Air Force increased, I decided to do some 
reading as a part of my research and also discussed the issue 
with some experts. Why are accidents in the Pakistani Air Force 
increasing? This is an entirely separate issue, and suffice to 
say that during my investigation, I had the opportunity to read 
a voluminous book written on the Pakistani Air Force. It is 
about 600-700 pages long and contains the history of our Air 
Force. There were many photographs and other details in the 
book, and I was pleasantly surprised that Christian officers and 
Christian young men in other ranks have sacrificed their lives 
with a smile on their faces while serving in the Pakistan Air 
Force. Seeing the greatness and depth of their emotions, I felt 
my emotions were not as strong as theirs. 
  If my information is correct, I can fearlessly say that the 
people and the government have not done much for the Pakistani 
Christians who have done a lot for the Air Force. These 
Christians have been treated a little better than untouchables 
in Islamic society. They have demonstrated an admirable love for 
our nation. I wish we had paid attention to their love and, 
learning from our own religion, had done something to alleviate 
the problems faced by the mistreated Christian society. Now, if 
that had happened, a major part of these Christians would be 
leading better lives. There is no doubt that we have forgotten 
the teachings of our religious prophets. 
  Because of our neglect of the Christian population, the 
United States, Western intelligence agencies, and foreign 
Christian missions had the opportunity to work with the 
Christians here. Because of our 45 years of complacency, some 
vested interests have risen among the Christians. We do not have 
a dearth of such elements among Pakistani Muslims, who wait for 
signs from abroad. 
  At a time when the United States and other Western powers 
are 
jointly trying to ensure that none of the Islamic countries 
gives up its Western style of living and presents a challenge to 
them, we should think about the issue of our treatment of the 
minorities here. The minorities should also consider that they 
do not become instrumental in efforts to weaken Pakistan's 
Islamic character. 
  Basically there are three minorities in Pakistan. There are 
the Christians, which I have already mentioned. There are 
Hindus, who have some influence in Sindh. There are also the 
Qadianis, who are so much opposed to the majority religion of 
our country that it is impossible to expect any constructive 
relationship with them. 
  The reader may recall that the minorities have opposed the 
efforts to include religion on identity cards in the campaign to 
displace the Nawaz Sharif government. Some of these minorities 
have become very active. Let us ignore this debate over whether 
inclusion of religion on identity cards is appropriate or not. 
There were two major reasons for the minorities' efforts to 
oppose it: First, to keep the Pakistani government on a secular 
footing as much as possible; second, to weaken a government that 
tried to give itself the Islamic color. At present, some 
religious parties have held demonstrations in support of the 
inclusion of religion on identity cards. The diplomats from the 
United States and some other Western powers supported the stand 
of the minorities openly. Thus, the opposing groups that were 
formed included the United States of America, Western powers, 
the PPP [Pakistan People's Party], and minorities, all on one 
side, and some political parties on the other. 
  In which direction are our minorities headed? The latest 
indicator was the day when the leader of the House was elected. 
Two Senate members of minority groups refused to take the oath 
of allegiance according to Islamic ceremonies. The present 
federal government of Pakistan is riding on the shoulders of 
these minorities, who consider Pakistani ideology to be 
interfering in their religion. 
  The latest aspect of this retrogression is that, at a time 
when the minority members refused to take the oath of allegiance 
according to Islamic rites, the members of Pakistan's Islamic 
Front were leaving the House. They failed when they had to do 
something. May God bless Maulana Fazal-ul Rehman that he 
countered the argument offered by the minority members and 
finally convinced them. 
  I do not want to draw some "dangerous" conclusions from this 
analysis. If regression is not stopped, then dangerous results 
will emerge automatically. All I want to do is identify this 
scenario. Not only minorities, but also a major political party 
in Pakistan, are supporting a two-nation theory, and those who 
should defend it have disappeared. There should have been 
someone whose voice we could hear, so that it could give us some 
courage.

  [Text] Fasilabad (PPA) -- The minister of internal affairs 
has formed plans to start an operation against illegal 
foreigners living in Pakistan. According to informed sources, 
the federal government has given instructions to investigating 
agencies about it. At the instruction of the federal government, 
important steps are being taken to deport the illegal immigrants 
living in our country. The records of all major hotels in the 
country are being investigated, following a special directive. 
According to these sources, more than 500,000 foreigners are 
living in Pakistan illegally.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Is Nawaz Sharif Opposing Nuclear Policy?"] </F>
  [Text] The members of the major opposition party walked out 
after making a lot of noise on the first day of the National 
Assembly session when they found that the nuclear policy issue 
was not included in the agenda. The Islamic Front, JUI 
[Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam], Nawabzada Nasrulla Khan, Balakh Sheikh 
Mazari, and some FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] 
members did not take part in this walkout. The federal law 
minister had called this action of the prime opposition party to 
be deplorable. At the same time, to keep the parliamentary 
process in a healthy environment, he has expressed his 
determination to keep the opposition happy. Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto has also stressed to her parliamentary group to 
try to cooperate with the opposition at all times and follow the 
assembly rules strictly. At the same time, she also reminded the 
opposition to show cooperation in the parliamentary process. 
  In our opinion, the assemblies exist just to express 
difference in opinion. However, every democratic country has 
special rules and regulations to follow in the assemblies, and 
every member has equal responsibility to follow these 
procedures. The problem with the major opposition party at 
present is that it considers the success of the elected 
government on Kashmir and nuclear policy issues to be its own 
defeat. Thus, it wants to blame the government on these two 
issues without any reason. It is insisting on opening a debate 
on the nuclear policy in the National Assembly for this purpose. 
The prime minister, the foreign minister, and the law minister 
insist that nuclear policy is the nation's most sensitive issue, 
and, while full briefing on it can be given to the assembly 
members, no open debate can be allowed. The prime minister has 
also reminded them that the present government has not formed 
any new nuclear policy; it is following the same policy as was 
in force before. It is clear that this is a fundamental issue of 
national importance, and the whole nation has no difference on 
it. Therefore, no political party should make this an issue for 
debate. Instead, as the prime minister has said, the opposition 
should fully support her government's efforts of removing the 
Pressler Amendment. 
  The foreign minister has reminded us in this context that 
India had blasted a nuclear bomb in 1974, and there was a lot of 
clamor in the world about it. India still has not discussed its 
nuclear program in the parliament. She also reminded them of the 
Koranic advice to "protect your secrets." In our opinion, the 
opposition should show some responsibility at least on such a 
sensitive issue and for the sake of our nation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Making Nuclear Program a Political Football"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said while addressing 
a press conference at the Karachi airport that the politicians 
have badly hurt the nuclear program by making it a political 
issue, and the government will not allow this anymore. At the 
same time, she revealed that Pakistan's nuclear program has been 
frozen since July 1990. She forgot that it was her government 
that ruled Pakistan at that time. The next day a government 
spokesman clarified that the program is frozen at the July 1990 
level, but it was not frozen by the Benazir government. The 
government that followed her was responsible for this action. 
This government spokesman told a "group of newsmen" that Madam 
Bhutto did not say that the nuclear program was frozen in July 
1990, instead it is frozen at the level it was in July 1990. The 
caretaker government appointed by Ghulam Ishaq Khan was 
responsible for it. (It should be remembered that this 
government was led by Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, who is special 
assistant to Madam Bhutto). Nawaz Sharif left this issue as it 
was. Now the nuclear program will not be left frozen as the 
situation has changed. Now the U.S. pressure is decreasing and 
Pakistan will be freed from the Pressler Amendment restriction 
without rolling back the nuclear program. 
  At Madam Bhutto's statement, her main rival, Nawaz Sharif, 
reacted by saying that Madam Bhutto had admitted to her "crime" 
about freezing the program during her government. Now she was 
making compromises with the United States, and the nation will 
not allow her to do that. Nawaz Sharif said in a meeting in 
Lahore that, by appointing a man like Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali the 
foreign minister and a journalist like Maliha Lodhi the 
ambassador to the United States, Madam Bhutto had clearly hinted 
that she is ignoring Pakistan's interests. 
  The whole nation listened to and read the feelings expressed 
by the prime minister and the former prime minister with great 
interest. Interestingly enough, both slipped while trying to 
push each other. Madam Bhutto did not remember that she was in 
power in July 1990. Now Nawaz Sharif forgot that Benazir's 
government was dismissed after July 1990, new elections were 
held, a new party called the IJI [Islami Jamhoori Ittehad] 
(coalition of some parties) came to power getting two-third 
majority, and the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] had failed to 
form government in any state. The man who won the crown to the 
prime ministership after this election was Nawaz Sharif. He 
headed the government from 1990 to the middle of 1993. 
  The question arises: If Madam Bhutto had frozen the nuclear 
program, why did not Nawaz Sharif disclose this information when 
he was the prime minister? If this freeze was harmful, why did 
not he rectify the problem? Why did he not take the nation into 
confidence and expose all her actions at that time? 
  We should also ask Madam Bhutto if Ghulam Ishaq Khan and 
Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi had frozen the nuclear program, and it was 
an inauspicious act (that is why she hesitates in accepting 
responsibility for it), then why did she make agreements with 
Khan and Jatoi? Why did she cooperate with them? Why did she let 
her representatives to become cabinet members during the 
caretaker government appointed by Mr. Khan? Why did she go as 
far as to let her husband be a minister? Why is Ghulam Mustafa 
her confidant now? Why did she go to his home and ask him to 
join her caravan? Can or should those who play with the nuclear 
program be given such revered positions? 
  Madam Bhutto is saying that the nuclear program should not 
be 
made a political issue, and, at the same time, is using it as a 
staff to punish other people. She also wants to take the credit 
for protecting the nuclear program. At the same time, she is 
trying to convince the nation that the nuclear program is safer 
then ever in her hands. 
  Unfortunately, Madam Bhutto has changed her stand on this 
matter so many times that we are not willing to consider her 
word on this issue to be firm. She has once said that the 
nuclear program was under the supervision of the president and 
the Army, and she did not know anything about it. Nawaz Sharif 
never announced such lack of authority; however, various members 
of his government had made some inferences about this issue. 
Therefore, we cannot say what plans he had for protecting the 
nuclear program, and what he did achieve in this area. We can 
argue in his defense that the United States did not reinstate 
aid of Pakistan during his tenure. It also spread rumors about 
declaring Pakistan a terrorist nation during that time. This 
U.S. attitude indicates that Nawaz Sharif did not bow down to 
the United States and refused to obey it. 
  Some people even say that the United States has punished 
Nawaz Sharif for his arrogance, and did not stop until he was 
thrown out of the corridors of power at a time when he had the 
majority support in the National Assembly and the Supreme Court 
had decided that the presidential action against him was 
improper and illegal. Without discussing how much truth there is 
in this claim, we have to say that some mysterious circumstances 
surrounded Nawaz Sharif's fall from power. The nation has not 
found the reason for this action yet. 
  Even when we ignore Nawaz Sharif's and Benazir Bhutto's 
statements, claims, and assurances, we still feel instead of 
making the nuclear program an excuse to accuse each other, they 
should explain what "freezing the program" means and what was 
its purpose is. Who was responsible for it? How much was our 
nation hurt by this action? The time for if, but, and because is 
past now, and neither you or anyone else can be fooled. 
Therefore, these efforts to dupe the nation should be stopped. 
The leaders of the government and the opposition should sit down 
together (the military leadership that ended the long march and 
assured new elections can arrange this) and instead of playing 
gulli-danda [Indian/Pakistani game] with it, make joint 
statements and present facts to the nation.

<F P=106> [Article by Irshad Ahmed Haqani: "Can Madam Bhutto Roll Back </F>
Nuclear Program?"] 
  [Text] At a press conference, opposition leader Nawaz 
Sharif expressed his opinion about the deplorable incident that 
happened during the general elections in Lahore. Many 
conflicting reports were published about this conference. 
According to one report, he said that he did not want to 
unsettle the government, and that he wanted to support the 
present democratic process. Another report states that he said 
he wanted to establish a coalition of as many political parties 
as possible to establish a front against the present government, 
and will do anything to remove this government. According to 
this report, he also said that the government's invitation to 
him to hold talks is a deception and a spurious suggestion. He 
did not consider the government sincere about this. He further 
said that the alleged attack on him was part of the government's 
conspiracy against him. He mentioned Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto's name, accusing her of this attack. Mr. Sharif's younger 
brother, Shehbaz Sharif, also spoke in the same tone. He went as 
far as saying that Aasif Ali Zardari, the prime minister's 
husband, stayed at the Chamba House the last time he visited 
Lahore. At that time, plans were made to attack Nawaz Sharif. 
The Sharif brothers refused to accept the attack on Nawaz Sharif 
as an accident, and declared that there was a major conspiracy 
behind it. The fact is that Nawaz Sharif received some 
complaints from his election workers about the polling station 
at Dyal Singh College. He went to investigate the complaint on 
site. His supporters and bodyguards fired some shots in the air, 
and when Mr. Nawaz Sharif arrived, the workers associated with 
the MSF [Muslim Students Federation] and the Muslim League (J) 
fired some shots. There was an exchange of fire between them and 
Nawaz Sharif's bodyguards. As I mentioned in my column 
yesterday, the statement of a senior police officer present 
there is very important in this context. He said that this 
incident did not appear to be planned; it was an incident that 
turned into a crisis, and firing was exchanged. According to 
him, it was totally wrong and deplorable to call it a conspiracy 
to murder Nawaz Sharif. Trying to accuse Aasif Zardari or Madam 
Benazir Bhutto is making a mountain out of a molehill, and is an 
outrageous act. Nawaz Sharif was upset about the Thursday 
incident, which is understandable. However, saying that the 
proposal to hold talks, which was made before this incident, is 
a deception, a fraud, or a lure only shows that he has no 
intention of participating in the proposed talks. 
  Nawaz Sharif says that Madam Bhutto froze the nuclear 
program 
during her last administration, and he fears that she will roll 
back the program now. Can a well-informed man like Nawaz Sharif, 
who has been prime minister of this country for two and one-half 
years, say with confidence that a prime minister has ever been 
so powerful as to decide to freeze the nuclear program? During 
her last administration, the military and the president did not 
take Madam Bhutto into confidence, and she has complained 
herself that the nuclear program was accelerated one step in the 
spring of 1990 without her knowledge. Against this background, 
is it possible that Madam Bhutto could freeze the nuclear 
program on her own? Mian Nawaz Sharif knows well that this is 
not possible. The fact is that General Ziaul Haq and Ishaq Khan 
had been in total control of the nuclear program after Zulfikar 
Ali Bhutto. After the position of prime minister was recreated, 
it had no control over the nuclear program. All the major 
decisions made about the nuclear program were based on the 
military and the president's agreements. Madam Bhutto's mention 
of freezing the program at the July 1990 level means that the 
people who were in power made this decision. Benazir alone could 
not have made this decision. Nawaz Sharif and his advisers are 
still making noise about Madam Bhutto rolling back the nuclear 
program, or that she will do so. We would like to ask these 
esteemed persons if they honestly believe that Madam Bhutto, 
even if she wants to, can roll back the nuclear program. There 
is only one answer to this question, and that is in the 
negative. The nuclear program in Pakistan is controlled and 
supervised jointly by the top leaders. If the prime minister 
wants, she cannot make such a decision on her own. I would like 
to explain this issue a little further. No step can be taken on 
the nuclear program without the approval and satisfaction of the 
armed forces. Therefore, the propaganda and noise that Madam 
Bhutto is ignoring national interests and is rolling back the 
nuclear program is totally baseless, meaningless, and 
incomprehensible. The Pakistani people should ignore the noise 
and tumult raised by the opposition and should not worry. Any 
decision made about this will be made with everyone's advice and 
with the nation's interests in mind. The decision to freeze the 
program was also a joint one. That is why Nawaz Sharif could not 
inform the nation about it being frozen, and nor could he make a 
decision to reverse this freeze. In his press conference in 
Islamabad, he said that he received the program when it was 
already frozen, and that what he did was in the interests of the 
nation. It is clear that the statements issued by Special 
Assistant Chowdhery Nisar Ali, Chairman of the Senate Wasim 
Sajjad, Secretary General of Foreign Affairs Akram Zaki, and 
Secretary of Foreign Affairs Sheharyar Khan in the United 
States, and the assurances they gave, were all based on the 
collective decisions. Muin Qureshi has also mentioned putting a 
cap on the nuclear program, which also reflects cooperative 
decisions. Pakistan's nuclear program is presently where the 
joint decision of our leaders wanted it to be. Any future 
decisions will also reflect the agreement of all. Nawaz Sharif 
and his associates said during the 1988 and 1990 elections that 
Madam Bhutto will sacrifice national interests over the Kashmir 
and the nuclear program. They are repeating this again. But 
their claims are baseless and contrary to common sense. It is 
against the government of Pakistan's government, and their 
purpose is just to have some cheap propaganda. It does not 
reflect sagacity or a mature viewpoint. Continuing it is not in 
the interests of our country. The opposition has the right to 
criticize the government, but not at the cost of our national 
interests. They should, of course, criticize the internal 
policies of Madam Bhutto, make them look bad and unsuccessful. 
However, they should not try to make the issues that were 
decided by common agreement, suspect or questionable. This will 
not help our country, and it will not help them either.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Opposition Should Stop Creating Troubles on the </F>
Nuclear Issue"] 
  [Text] The government's refusal to discuss the nuclear 
issue in the National Assembly can be understood by the wise and 
patriotic circles in the nation. There seems to be reason to 
make this sensitive issue a subject of discussion after the 
statement issued by our foreign minister on the nuclear program. 
Even most of the opposition parties have expressed satisfaction 
over the government's stand that whatever happens the nuclear 
program will not be rolled back keeping in mind the greater 
interest of the nation. However, Mian Nawaz Sharif and his 
followers, just out of their old habit, have made the nuclear 
program a subject of controversy. According to one sources, the 
prime minister has directed the president's attention to this 
issue and told them that all of us have taken the oath to 
protect national secrets; therefore, we cannot allow open debate 
over the nuclear program. She added that the noise raised by the 
opposition is meaningless. The prime minister asked the 
president since he is the custodian of all national assets 
including the nuclear program. As the leader of the nation, he 
should officially remind the opposition leader of the oath which 
he has also taken. 
  In our opinion, the opposition leader is not a naughty child 
who should be admonished from unnecessary stubbornness. He knows 
well that nothing was done about the nuclear program that could 
have made our government's policy disputable. The present 
government if following the same policy as formed during Nawaz 
Sharif's government. The only difference is that the U.S. 
government has introduced a new amendment in the Congress. This 
proposed amendment will remove the clause in the Pressler 
Amendment that was used to stop aid to Pakistan. This amendment 
will also the give the right to the U.S. President to exempt 
specific nations from restrictions on U.S. aid that come under 
the Symington, Clayton, and Solarz amendments, if it is 
necessary to achieve his foreign policy goals. The U.S. 
President, however, will make sure that such countries are not 
involved in terrorism, violating human rights or nuclear 
proliferation before he grants exemption. This progress is 
positive from Pakistan's point of view. Perhaps, the opposition 
leader has concluded from this progress that the prime minister 
and the U.S. government has some secret agreement, and decided 
to challenge the government in his ritualistic attitude. He 
smells some conspiracy and threatens that rivers of blood will 
flow if the nuclear program is rolled back. Perhaps because of 
this noise raised by the opposition, it was necessary to warn 
Pakistan that it should not be deluded to believe that the new 
legislation will give it freedom to make nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Madam, You Too Will Be Rolled Back!"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, while addressing 
editors of national newspapers in Islamabad, said that the 
question of rolling back Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program 
does not arise, because the nation's defense depends on it. She 
said that the last four governments agreed fully on this issue, 
and that all were united on it. She also asked the United States 
to review its decision on the use of the Pressler Amendment 
against Pakistan, and the unfair treatment that was practiced 
over the last several years. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto made this announcement at a 
time when her statement, in which she had earlier admitted that 
Pakistan's nuclear program was frozen at the July 1990 level, 
was being discussed in political, journalistic, and intellectual 
circles. This happened during her previous administration. 
Later, however, even after an explanation by a federal 
spokesperson, Benazir Bhutto's comment became a subject of 
criticism and analysis. Now that she has very loudly and clearly 
told editors from around the country that the nuclear program 
will be continued, popular opinion will definitely be positively 
affected, and it will also help in correcting the records. 
Still, the opposition insists (actually accuses) that Madam 
Bhutto's earlier statement was not just a statement, but an 
admission. Still, this question is very important, and it 
requires an explanation: who committed the condemnable act of 
freezing the peaceful nuclear program, which symbolizes our 
nation's security and pride, at the July 1990 level? 
  We do not have to elaborate on the fact that the United 
States of America and European nations openly provide 
technology, advice, equipment, and other things to nuclear 
programs all over the world, earning billions of dollars in 
doing so. The nuclear programs of Israel, India, Japan, 
Argentina, and South Africa come under this category. But they 
do not object to these programs. If there are any objections in 
this context, they are limited to opposition to the Islamic 
world, and Pakistan is a chosen target, because Iraq's military 
and nuclear capabilities were destroyed in the Gulf war. The 
U.S. opposition to Pakistan has reached the point where it does 
not give permission to Pakistani students in the United States 
to register for classes in nuclear technology and related 
subjects. Military and economic aid to Pakistan was stopped 
three years ago under the notorious Pressler Amendment. The F-16 
planes, which were already paid for according to the agreement, 
were not supplied to us, and even some U.S. circles have 
admitted that Washington's unfair treatment of Pakistan has now 
reached extremes. 
  Soon after Benazir Bhutto's statements in July 1990 about 
freezing the nuclear program, we received news from Washington 
which clearly and simply indicated that the Pressler Amendment 
will end now. Michael McCurry, a U.S. State Department 
spokesman, went as far as implying that aid to Pakistan would be 
reinstated. Benazir herself has said, "We cannot get rid of the 
Pressler Amendment without rolling back our program." Against 
this background, a worrisome question emerges. How can the 
Pressler Amendment, which was very effective until a few days 
ago, suddenly become useless? Why has the White House decided to 
take it back? What are the circumstances that have forced the 
United States, even after seeing the Kahuta plant in operation, 
to reinstate aid to Pakistan? In this context, the concern of 
our fellow citizens that there is something suspicious about the 
present nuclear policy is valid (to an extent). 
  We believe that Madam Benazir Bhutto should complete her 
five-year term in the Prime Minister's house, because this is 
necessary to encourage democratic institutions and stability. We 
cannot help any effort to shake up her government without any 
reason. But it is the duty of Benazir Bhutto to remove all the 
doubts and skepticism about the present government's intention 
to make some agreement with the United States over the nuclear 
program, which has resulted in good will messages from 
Washington. We want to tell Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 
loud, clear, and direct words that if she rolls back our nuclear 
program, she herself will be rolled back!

<F P=106> [Article by Tehsimul Haq Haqi: "Need for Effective Steps To </F>
Control Drugs"] 
  [Text] A lot has been written about the abuse and ill 
effects of drugs. However, no effective steps have been taken to 
stop this curse. This has resulted in escalated abuse by the 
younger generation. According to a report issued by the director 
of intelligence, about 1.2 million people are addicted to this 
ugly habit. From among the 45,000 prisoners, 12,000 were 
arrested for crimes related to the drug trade. In some areas of 
Punjab as many as 40 percent of the population is involved in 
drug trade. According to the findings of a U.S. drug expert, 
drug traders are earning $1.22 billion from the heroin trade 
alone. The question arises: can we afford to spend that much 
money? The administration should consider how much money they 
spend to control the drug trade. The little work being done to 
control drug abuse in Pakistan is insufficient. Even now 200,000 
new persons fall prey to drug abuse each year. If people 
continued to become drug addicts at this rate, the time is not 
far off when 15 percent of Pakistan's population will be 
suffering from this addiction. The former caretaker prime 
minister, Mayueen Qureshi, had a list of drugs smugglers which 
included over 160 very influential persons from our country. 
Because of political considerations this list was neither made 
public nor were these smugglers arrested. Now after the removal 
of the caretaker government, this whole affair seems to have 
been totally ignored. It is not expected that a political 
government will touch influential persons. The second problem is 
that, because of the specific kind of government and life style 
in our tribal areas, the drug dealers move there to avoid 
arrests. Others get support from political leaders and move to 
Afghanistan which is famous for producing and smuggling drugs 
all over the world. 
  According to a report issued by an international narcotics 
control agency, Afghanistan is second after Burma for exporting 
opium. The figures included in this report show that poppy 
cultivation increased by 12 percent in Afghanistan last year 
(1992), and 1470.19 acre land was used for cultivating poppy. 
This will harvest 640 metric tons of heroin. In Langaryar and 
Halmand provinces of Afghanistan, 75 percent of the land is used 
for growing opium. If the Afghan people want, they could take 
concrete steps to stop drug abuse. Drug abuse is extremely 
dangerous for people, and they cannot adjust themselves to their 
environments. This reduces their judgment ability. The curse of 
drug abuse cannot be controlled by rhetoric and statements given 
to the press. This curse can be ended only when concrete steps 
are taken. Not only this, strict action is necessary against 
those who are involved in this trade. Our younger generation can 
play an important role in this context, if they unite and 
resolve to stop the rising tide of drug abuse and its negative 
effects. If they do that, there is no reason that we cannot rid 
the society of the evils of drug dealers and drug abuse.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Campaign Against Drug Smugglers"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken a stern 
notice of the increasing drug abuse in our country, and has 
instructed taking some steps against it. At the same time, she 
told the relevant government agencies to become fully active in 
this area. While chairing a high-level meeting of an 
antinarcotics task force in Islamabad on 30 November, she 
approved plans for a strong and effective operation against 
major smugglers and smuggling in this country. On this occasion, 
Madam Bhutto said that the drug smugglers must be arrested at 
any cost, and the government will not accept political pressure 
of any kind in this context so that this curse can be eradicated 
from our country. While addressing this special meeting, the 
prime minister instructed them to deal with the drug smugglers 
with an iron hand. The government cannot tolerate this ugly 
crime and curse under any circumstance because this curse has 
ruined thousands of people and their families. Who does not know 
that production and smuggling of drugs in our country has 
caused innumerable social and moral ills here and many people 
are losing their health and lives. Not only this, members of 
their family, after suffering from economic and social crisis, 
lead impoverished lives. If we briefly survey our recent past, 
we will learn that the drug abuse epidemic that has spread all 
over our country did not even exist 12-14 years earlier. There 
was not even one heroin addict in our whole country, and now 
they number in the hundreds of thousands. The number is 
increasing rapidly. In addition, we are getting a bad name 
abroad, and this is not a secret. Those who have travelled 
abroad well know that every Pakistani is considered to be a drug 
dealer in Western nations although most of these nations suffer 
from this curse themselves. It is our misfortune that many 
influential persons in our country are involved or they are 
protecting these criminals who are involved in this hated drug 
trade here or abroad. At times, this involvement enters into our 
politics because it is not possible to practice politics here 
without a lot of money, and there is no easier way to collect a 
lot of money than this trade. A review of the drug trade shows 
that it is destroying our society here and giving our country a 
bad name abroad. The previous governments had also announced 
plans of action against drug smugglers, and the leaders had 
expressed their determination to use an iron hand to arrest drug 
smugglers and punish them in order to rid the country of this 
curse. However, the spout continued to flow right there. The 
action of the present government to rid society of the curse of 
drugs and to take action against it is commendable. Still, we 
must study the reasons for the failure of previous governments 
in this area. Who are the people who protect these criminals? 
Why were not the operations launched in the past successful? 
Until these basic facts are analyzed, every campaign in this 
area will be unsuccessful.

  [Text] The director general of the Narcotics Control Board 
said in a speech that all efforts to control the drug trade in 
Pakistan have been unsuccessful because some elected officials, 
high-level government administrators, members of assemblies, 
industrialists, and even some members of the Narcotics Control 
Board itself are involved in this trade. He named one assembly 
member, who was sentenced in London, but is still a member of 
the assembly. He also mentioned apprehending drugs valued at 20 
million rupees belonging to a very important person in Karachi. 
  If the Narcotics Board first removes its own corrupt 
employees, it could be successful in its mission of catching the 
`big fish' with government cooperation. What is necessary is 
forming a solid plan and then asking for cooperation from all 
those countries that have made remarkable progress in 
controlling this evil.

<F P=106> [Article by Jebul Rehman: "Internal Conflict of the Ruling </F>
Party Can Affect the Nation"] 
  [Text] Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the PPP [Pakistan People's 
Party] founder, wrote a letter to his daughter from the Central 
Jail in Rawalpindi on 21 June 1978. He had given the party 
leadership to her through this letter. Her father had given 
Benazir advice about policy. Mr. Bhutto had written: "Since the 
slogans of days past are like old songs, they lost their quality 
of ravishing one's heart. Therefore, new slogans should be 
raised in each era; however, the principles should not be 
changed." The Central Committee of the PPP elected Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto as chairperson of the party instead of 
Begum Nusrat Bhutto and followed late Bhutto's 1978 decision. 
Rejecting this action, taken after 15 years, Begum Nusrat Bhutto 
said that the party's Central Committee had made her chairperson 
for life when the Supreme Court had rejected her late husband's 
request for bail. The kind mother of the prime minister said 
that no one else could become the chairperson or chairman of the 
party as long as she was alive. The Central Committee's 
resolution to appoint the new person to this position on 5 
December 1993 was unconstitutional and illegal. In light of the 
stand Begum Nusrat Bhutto's has taken, we can say that, if the 
mother and daughter did not make up their differences, the PPP 
will remain in two camps, and the daughter will have to compete 
against the mother. After Mr. Bhutto was hanged, Benazir Bhutto 
spent some time in jails, and was released on condition that she 
would leave the country. In 1986 she was not only given 
permission to return to Pakistan, but to participate in 
politics. The Americans had gotten assurance from then-Pakistani 
rulers that Benazir Bhutto would not be arrested, all possible 
arrangements would be made for her safety, and no restriction 
would be imposed on her public meetings and rallies. In 1986 she 
became the joint chairperson of her father's party. Her mother 
had agreed to her getting this new position in the party. Nusrat 
Bhutto was happy that her talented daughter with her high-level 
education, unique intelligence, and courage was successfully 
reinstating the popularity of the PPP. The mother, in her joy, 
had given her daughter free hand to run party affairs. After 
marrying Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, there some changes appeared in 
Madam Bhutto's policies that worried some senior party leaders. 
The mother began to get new complaints about her daughter's 
attitude almost daily. It is said that these complaints were not 
removed despite Begum Bhutto's efforts. As a result, many old 
associates of the late Mr. Bhutto began to leave the party one 
by one. Madam Bhutto had no regrets at losing her political 
uncles because she felt that these alleged uncles had not made 
any serious efforts to save her father from hanging. 
  In addition to her personal feelings, the late Ziaul Haq's 
supporting lobby had also effectively spread the rumors that 
some of these senior leaders had advised in favor of hanging 
Bhutto. According to Zia's lobby, some of these wanted to avenge 
Mr. Bhutto for his contemptuous attitude. Some of them were 
hoping that the leadership of the PPP would turn to them once 
the candle of Mr. Bhutto's life was extinguished. When these 
deluded leaders were disappointed, they not only said goodbye to 
the PPP but began to sow seeds of distrust in the mind of exiled 
brother Murtaza Bhutto against his sister and the 
brother-in-law. Murtaza Bhutto was told that Asif Zardari was 
trying to take over his ancestral rights and that Zardari's hold 
on the PPP affairs was also tightening. It is said that some 
officials of one of the Pakistani intelligence service were 
involved in efforts to persuade Murtaza to act against his 
sister. Murtaza Bhutto became very eager to return home. When 
Madam Bhutto became the prime minister, Nusrat Bhutto insisted 
that arrangements should be made for Murtaza Bhutto's return. 
When this was not done, both mother and the son had the 
misunderstanding that the prime minister did not want Murtaza 
Bhutto to return. When he returned, his arrest naturally was 
very unpleasant to his mother. Murtaza Bhutto was brought into 
the election arena and when he competed against PPP-nominated 
candidates, his mother openly supported him. Subordinates told 
the prime minister and her husband that Nusrat Bhutto and her 
son had started plans to take over the PPP. A plan to remove 
this danger was made. According to it the honorable mother was 
to be removed from the party chairperson's position, and a joint 
chairperson was to take over all responsibilities. This plan was 
approved and for simple display or out of respect the daughter 
appealed to the mother to relinquish the highest position of the 
party and become the chief patron. This appeal was rejected. 
Murtaza Bhutto's associates requested Begum Nusrat Bhutto to be 
adamant and declare that she was the permanent PPP chairperson. 
Begum Nusrat accepted the advice of her son's political advisors 
and supporters. 
  The party well-wishers who were upset at this 
mother-daughter 
conflict and who do not want the party to divide into two groups 
joined forces and decided to persuade Benazir Bhutto to meet 
with Nusrat Bhutto along with Asif Zardari and find a way to 
make her change her mind. It was decided that Murtaza Bhutto's 
cooperation was necessary for this effort. Thus, the prime 
minister is to be advised to start negotiations with her dear 
brother, and if necessary go visit him in jail. The party 
well-wishers feel that arrangements should be made to get 
Murtaza released on bail immediately and that efforts be made to 
take back all the cases against him in order to improve Nusrat 
and Murtaza Bhutto's mood. Former National Assembly Speaker 
Ma'raj Khalid, who is considered one of the party founders, is 
very active in these reconciliatory efforts. Ma'raj Khalid 
maintains that there are examples of recalling cases based on 
serious crimes when the greater national interest was involved. 
The present situation demands that political stability be 
established in Sindh. To attain this important national goal the 
present PPP government should not hesitate in taking the cases 
against Mir Murtaza Bhutto and MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] 
leader Iltaf Hussein. In this context if President Farooq 
Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto use their special 
privileges, all perceptive Pakistanis who know the need for 
political action to improve the situation in Sindh will be 
relieved. 
  The opponents of the PPP have a different opinion about the 
conflict between Nusrat Bhutto and her daughter. The Pakistan 
Muslim League (Nawaz) leaders declare it a major political drama 
to give the opposition the message not to start a campaign 
against Benazir's government. They should respect the prime 
minister's pro-federal politics and support her decisions on 
sensitive issues; otherwise, the extremist elements in Sindh 
might raise their head with full force. If we consider the point 
expressed by the Muslim League (N) observers to be wrong and 
dismiss this theory of staging drama, we still have to admit 
that it is necessary that the PPP leadership remains in 
Benazir's hands to strengthen Sindh's allegiance to the nation. 
Her position in Sindh should not become weaker, and the new 
efforts of cooperating between the MQM and the PPP should be 
successful. If the division within the PPP is not stopped and if 
it does not establish stable relations with the MQM, then 
deployment of soldiers for a long time in Sindh will become a 
necessity. Such measures will affect Sindh's developmental 
plans. As Sindhis feel the pinch of deprivation of basic 
amenities, the question about where aid from the central 
government to Sindh goes will arise painfully. It should be 
remembered that Sindh provides 60 percent of the central 
government's total revenue. Therefore, we can say that the 
welfare of Pakistan depends on Sindh's staying within Pakistan 
and on the fact that the anti-national and separatist elements 
do not flourish in the nerve center of this state, Karachi. The 
MQM representatives, while discussing the neglect of Karachi 
residents' basic needs and the result of this neglect, have 
advised prominent national leaders to establish a separate task 
force to study Karachi's economic problems and find solutions 
for them. This task force should be composed of representatives 
from the PPP, MQM, industrial organizations, commerce groups, 
and labor unions and should be asked to present its report 
within two months. This report should identify the problems and 
also suggest ways and means to resolve these problems. 
  Sindh had to spend about 2.5 billion rupees for the military 
operation last year. One Sindhi senator had appealed to the 
president, the prime minister, defense minister, and the high 
command of the armed forces against these charges. He asks what 
reasons there are for charging additional money for the 
Pakistani military service when it is doing its duty within 
Pakistan? According to the constitution, it is the duty of the 
Army to help the civilian government when need arises. The 
question raised by a Senate member is not the only one which 
needs attention, several questions related to defense expenses 
need be answered. The National Assembly does not have the 
constitutional right to audit defense expenses. At the same 
time, the feeling is becoming common that the fundamental reason 
for our nation's backwardness is the fact that our defense 
expenses are much more than our resources. After increasing our 
foreign debt to meet defense needs, the money left for meeting 
our people's basic needs is nominal. Governments increase taxes 
without reason to make up their monetary shortages. This sends 
the price of commodities up. As a result people with limited 
income are suffering. The number of psychological patients is 
increasing daily, the increase in crime and accident is ruining 
the society's piece of mind, and the rate of illiteracy is 
touching new heights. 
  According to a recent report issued by the education 
ministry, there are 121 countries in the world with very low 
literacy rates. Pakistan's position is 111 in that list. In 
other words, only 10 other countries have higher illiteracy 
rates than that of Pakistan. The situation in the area of food 
is so bad that we have to import wheat, pulses, and edible oils. 
The scarcity of electricity has forced us into the problem of 
load shedding. The nation was told on the television last week 
that we will need at least 60 billion rupees to enable us to 
generate enough electricity to meet our needs. Even when we get 
this huge amount, we still will have to wait a few years to get 
rid of the practice of load shedding. The spokesmen for the 
federal finance ministry are telling us the good news that the 
amount of our foreign exchange reserve has increased. However, 
they do not tell us how much foreign exchange will be left after 
the interest and the next installments of foreign debts are 
paid. It is not clear how we will repay the foreign exchange 
deposited by private individuals spent by our government. 
Instead of keeping the Pakistani people in the dark, it would be 
better to admit openly that our country is going through a 
serious economic crisis. In order to get out of it, we must 
change our foreign policy in such a way that our geographical 
borders are secure and we do not have to purchase new weapons 
costing us tens of millions of dollars, that the military and 
economic aid now suspended is reinstated, and that foreign 
investment in our country on large scale becomes a reality.

<F P=106> [News Report: "Number of Heroin Addicts in Pakistan 1.5 </F>
Million Now" 
  [Text] Karachi, 22 December (Staff Report)--The number of 
heroin addicts in Pakistan exceeds 1.5 million now. These heroin 
addicts spend 43.8 billion rupees to support this habit. This 
information was revealed by a voluntary organization based on 
findings in its latest survey. According to this survey, people 
got heroin free in 1979. In 1981 a small packet of heroin cost 
10 rupees. Now this same packet costs 30 rupees. Interestingly 
enough, the increase in price was accompanied by adulteration in 
heroin. This is indicated by the fact that in 1979 one could 
make seven-eight cigarettes from one packet of heroin. Now they 
cannot make even one loose cigarette from that. A heroin addict 
has to spent 80 to 200 rupees daily to support his habit. 
Another interesting fact learned from this survey is that the 
majority of heroin addicts are educated people. Only 17 percent 
of these addicts are illiterate. These addicts include those 
with masters degrees. The majority of these heroin addicts are 
between the ages of 21 and 30, and 25 percent of these addicts 
have been using heroin for more than 10 years. Seventy-five 
percent of these addicts go back to the habit because of bad 
company even after treatment.

<F P=106> [Article by Massud Sahir: "Benazir's Collaboration With U.S. </F>
Will Be Unmasked by Mid-1994"] 
  [Text] Exactly when they are fighting for bones in the 
ruling party, the prince, the princess, and the queen of the 
royal family of Larkana are fighting for power and privileges. 
Arguments are rampant over appointing heads of states just like 
in the Mogul era. The unfortunate historical event of a mother 
and daughter fighting for power is also happening within the 
People's Party. The scene of a mother being insulted by the 
daughter for power is emerging before us. This disgusting scene 
has made the ugliness of many struggles for power in history to 
be less grisly. Let us save the details of this fight and the 
identification of its script writer and directors for some other 
time. All this is happening at this very sensitive and dangerous 
time when Pakistan is entangled in two extremely important 
problems. Efforts to make a decision about Kashmir have been 
accelerated all over the world. Millions of Pakistanis and 
Kashmiris have been waiting for the resolution of the Kashmir 
issue for the last 40 years. Kashmir is the place where the 
humble servants of the Prophet are sacrificing their lives 
daily. They are occupied fully in working for their goal of 
gaining independence from India and joining Pakistan. Not a day 
passes without depressing and heartrending news from some corner 
of the world about the future of this Kashmir. 
  Many important people have visited Pakistan and India during 
the last few months to talk about it. First, U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Robin Rafael came to Pakistan, followed by a 
visit of a deputation led by Roger Godsave, chairman of the 
British Parliament's committee on Kashmir. They visited the 
United States for one month before coming to Pakistan. On 
Monday, Pakistan's worst enemy Senator Pressler arrived in 
Islamabad with some other senators. Pressler thought it 
important to visit India before coming here. His activities will 
be clear to us in a couple of days; however, diplomatic circles 
in the capital have firmly declared that whatever Benazir 
Bhutto, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and smooth-talking Mirza Aslam Baig 
could have done during the 90 days has been done. Now whatever 
is happening is just an occurrence behind the facade of which 
Benazir will do with Kashmir what she has done with the nuclear 
program. We can inquire later whether she had the support of all 
these powers that had blessed her when she had frozen the 
nuclear program. During the visit by Richard Godsave, who is 
considered the leading expert on Kashmir in Great Britain, the 
elements associated with those who militarily help the freedom 
fighters were very happy. The opinion he expressed about Kashmir 
while in Pakistan deserves our attention. He announced loudly 
that "this problems cannot be resolved with UN resolutions. 
Those who believe that the Kashmir issue can be resolved with UN 
resolutions should get out of the dream world. The world has 
changed a lot. We must accept facts and look for new ways. The 
United Nations cannot resolve this issue. Anyone who says that 
the Kashmir issue can be resolved by putting economic 
restrictions on India is living in fool's paradise. India's 
relations with Europe and the United States are very close. It 
is important to think with a cool head at this point." Roger 
Godsave threatened: "If Pakistan remained adamant on its 
emotional stand on this issue, it will get nothing." Commenting 
on his visit with the president and the prime minister, Roger 
said: "I feel that Pakistan needs to be flexible in its stand." 
Roger also said that the people of Kashmir are the ones who are 
actually affected by this problem, and, until they are involved, 
this issue cannot be resolved. 
  The proposal for a three-party discussion was presented by 
Sayyed Ali Gelani, an Azad Kashmir leader, at the beginning of 
this year. However, this proposal was first presented in the 
United States of America. It was organized by Dr. Ghulam Nabi 
Fai, the executive director of Kashmiri American Council. It is 
said that this proposal was just like the proposal Nawaz Sharif 
had presented for the nuclear program. The organizers also 
proposal were also sitting far away. 
  Roger Godsave had presented a formula for resolving the 
Kashmir issue during his trip to the United States. This formula 
in itself is a masterpiece. Godsave claims that the Kashmir 
issue can be resolved if this formula is followed. According to 
this formula: 
  1. The secretary general of the United Nations has to 
appoint 
a special emissary for Kashmir. This emissary will visit both 
sides of Kashmir in addition to visiting India and Pakistan to 
get a first-hand account of the situation. He is to present his 
report to the secretary general. This emissary will also be 
responsible for cooling the emotional attitude of both countries 
leaders on Kashmir to enable them to take further steps to 
resolve the Kashmir issue. This emissary also have to make both 
countries to agree to call back their armed forces out of 
Kashmir. 
  2. In the second phase, steps are necessary for India and 
Pakistan to recall their armed forces from the area of Kashmir 
under their control. 
  3. The UN peace force should be sent to Kashmir as soon as 
both countries recall their troops. 
  4. The peace force will stay in Kashmir for five or ten 
years 
and this whole region will remain under UN control. During this 
period, conditions will be made conducive to making a decision 
on Kashmir's future. An interim government under the UN 
supervision will be established there until the situation 
improves. 
  5. A referendum on both parts of Kashmir will be conducted 
during the fifth phase so that the people of Kashmir can decide 
on their future. 
  6. The most important aspect of this formula is that the 
representatives of the Kashmiri people will participate in every 
important discussions during this interim period. 
  This proposal is clear about its positive and negative 
aspects. The proposal also makes it clear what it means to keep 
the whole Kashmir under the United Nations for five to ten 
years. We also know what changes will happen when the United 
States, hiding behind the facade of the United Nations, 
establishes its feet in this region, and in what tone the United 
States will talk to Pakistan, India, and China to get them to 
agree to certain conditions. The United States will do whatever 
it wants during these five or ten years, and it is not difficult 
to guess what the result will be when the time for a referendum 
comes. The referendum, if it is held, will not be according to 
the UN resolutions. As is clear from Roger Godsave's statement, 
this referendum will be held in the light of the new 
developments and to look for a "new resolution" of the problem. 
It is not a hidden fact that many Pakistani politicians are also 
thinking in the same vein. 
  Those who know are saying with confidence that Benazir's 
dealings with the United States over resolving the Kashmir issue 
is the cat that will be out of the bag in the middle of 1994. 
This is not a new thing; this pressure was increasing since the 
beginning of Mohammed Nawaz Sharif's government. The path that 
Mohammed Nawaz Sharif took to get out of this pressure was to 
look for new friends around the world. He had found new friends 
in the form of Japan and Korea. However, the results of his 
efforts are in front of the nation. There is no one here to 
stand up to the U.S. pressure. The whole U.S. effort is to get 
India out of this appalling situation which it is in now in 
occupied Kashmir. One way to achieve it is to send a message of 
disappointment to those struggling in Kashmir by holding talks 
between India and Pakistan. It is a different story as to the 
kind of impression the Pakistan media will present of these 
talks. The main purpose of this exercise is how India uses these 
negotiations while they are in progress and later. If an 
agreement is reached to declare Siachen a nonmilitary zone 
during the first phase, it would be progress toward a solution 
that the Americans have been presenting to us for the last few 
years. Division of Kashmir is part of this agenda. What they are 
saying is: 
  1. A situation must be created for paving the way toward 
implementing Roger Godsave's formula. 
  2. Kashmir be divided over religion. 
  3. Line of Control be recognized as a permanent border. 
  4. By ignoring the UN resolutions, a situation would be 
created whereby Kashmir is neither under Pakistan nor under 
India. 
  It is not possible to implement solution number two as this 
might result in creating several "East Pakistans" within 
Kashmir. The Muslim population has spread into two or three 
parts of Jammu and Laddakh in addition to the Kashmir valley. 
Any division in this situation will result in additional riots 
and the situation will become worse. Similarly, there is no 
logic in accepting the Line of Control as the permanent border 
nor will it satisfy any side. Suggestions number one and four 
appear to be the same suggestion presented in two different 
ways, and efforts have been accelerated to implement them. It 
appears that some influential supporters for this proposal have 
been created in occupied Kashmir. At the same time, those who 
raise the slogan for Pakistan in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir have 
been so discouraged that the Azad Kashmir leaders are telling 
the volunteers that they are willing to accept a solution that 
the leadership of occupied Kashmir will approve. This news was 
published in the national papers; however, it was not given as 
much attention as should have been. No one tried to find out the 
purpose of it all. What kind of solution is the leadership in 
occupied Kashmir proposing? This is not limited to talks with 
India at the government level. Benazir Bhutto has been able to 
participate in those talks because of Nawaz Sharif's pressure. 
However, efforts are being made to make the U.S. solution 
acceptable. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is trying to convince herself 
that she has learned a lot in the past and will not repeat those 
mistakes that hurt her in the past. At the same time she is 
making all the arrangements to encourage the same kind of 
uncivil and criminal activities that had brought the people out 
in the streets in 1977. 
  How does the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] want to treat the 
institutions established according to the constitution and laws? 
One can guess from the incident which occurred last Monday at 
the Election Commission office. Three PPP assembly members are 
responsible for it. Chowdehry Ishfaq, Pir Mohammed Aslam Bodha, 
and Shahid Nazir wanted the Election Commission to issue 
notification about their winning the election immediately so 
that they could take the oath without waiting. When they arrived 
at the Election Commission office, neither the chief election 
commissioner nor the secretary of the Election Commission 
Humayun Khan was there. They ordered the personal assistants to 
the election commissioner and the secretary to issue these 
notifications at once. When these lowly workers explained that 
it was not within their authority, they went to see Joint 
Secretary Sardar Durani. They cursed him and threw a paper 
weight at him. The PPP lawmakers were told that these 
notifications cannot be issued until the official results are 
given by the returning officer and details of property ownership 
of newly elected candidates are received. Still, they demanded 
that all laws and regulations be suspended and notifications 
issued. For one hour S-Block, where the law ministry along with 
the Election Commission offices are located, was ruled by 
lawlessness. The police on duty joined the onlookers there. 
These people finally left after threatening the staff. The 
reason was that the National Assembly session was adjourning on 
Monday, and these people were going to miss their daily 
allowance for several days if they did not take the oath that 
day. 
  At 8:00 p.m. when Chief Election Commissioner Justice 
Naiumuddin and Secretary Humayun Khan reached the office, the 
staff informed them of the whole story. One government official 
told us that the personal assistant of Justice Naimuddin told 
him the whole story while weeping bitterly. The old retired 
justice could not do any thing except to give a day off to his 
staff so they could recover from this abuse. The PPP officials 
are the kind who do not respect even active judges. Earlier, 
Benazir Bhutto's law minister (he is gone now) Sher Afghan had 
put pressure on the Election Commission and had them change the 
date for the internal election. 
  The grisly part of this whole affair is that the newspapers 
did not take any notice of it, and only Daily PAKISTAN published 
this news item. It is said that the chief election commissioner 
called a long meeting with two other judges and high officials 
of the commission. It was also discussed if these PPP assembly 
members should be charged with the contempt of court as demanded 
by the staff. However, after the meeting, Justice Naimuddin 
advised his staff to be patient and not to stretch this affair 
too far. Allah will look after us. When the staff continued to 
insist, Justice Naimuddin told them that since he was the oldest 
of them all they should respect his age, and forget this 
incident. However, he did receive the written complaints of his 
staff. He told this reporter that he had decided not to take any 
action over this fiasco and that the case was closed. The 
leaders and the members of the PPP have abused every agency and 
the weak heads of these agencies are covering up to be commended 
for their loyalties.

<F P=106> [Article by Shahnawaz Farooqi: "Nawaz Sharif's Political </F>
Future"] 
  [Text] In politics trust sometime changes into mistrust. In 
Pakistan, that is what happened to General Ziaul Haq, to Ghulam 
Ishaq Khan and to Mohammed Nawaz Sharif. Nawaz Sharif is a 
classical example of this practice. All the assumptions he made 
about his power proved to be wrong. Opposed to all the talks 
about his being an iron man, he proved to be made of wax. 
Situations and events threw him wherever they wanted to. He is 
not a statue that can be kept in Madam Tassaud's Wax Works. His 
political personality has many potentials. However, these 
potentials will be realized only if it can proved that he is a 
man of bones and flesh, and not the one of steel nerves. What we 
mean is that we have to see how many changes he makes in his 
perceived personality. He will have to make a major overhaul in 
his personality and image. Without it, his political prospects 
could change into apprehension. 
  The major tendency in Pakistani politics until now was for 
various political parties and persons, especially those who had 
the potential to rise to power, to have considered the 
weaknesses of the opposition party or person as a cause of his 
strength. It rarely happened when a political party or 
personality gained strength in the real sense instead of 
depending on the weakness of the opponents. Madam Benazir 
Bhutto's lengthy political efforts have also hovered around this 
negative tendency. Mr. Nawaz Sharif has also done the same in 
the past and is doing so now. However, the polarization in our 
society has reached to such a level that the weakness of a 
political party will not benefit its opponents; it will, instead 
benefit several people. The campaign that Madam Bhutto had 
started against Nawaz Sharif was the last one. She will not be 
able to run a similar campaign again. 
  The greatest danger to Nawaz Sharif's political future is 
the 
lack of a "real problem" in his agenda. He does not have a 
separate identity either. Even Z. A. Saleiri, one of his 
sympathizers, admits that there is very little difference 
between Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto and the PPP [Pakistan 
People's Party] and Muslim League's Nawaz Group. He has said 
that in his recent article. Nawaz Sharif's lack of issues is 
also evident from his total focus on the problems of the Bhutto 
family. He was hurt instead of benefitting by starting talk on 
the nuclear issue. He makes statements on the Kashmir issue; 
however, he knows he cannot get much mileage from it. He will 
end up making the United States his adversary which he cannot 
afford. There are two reasons for it. One, it is not politically 
beneficial to him. Second, he does not see any possibility in 
this issue. His statements on economic issues are also hurting 
him. For example, when he says that Madam Bhutto has no economic 
agenda and she is following his government's economic policies, 
he appears to be criticizing Benazir Bhutto. At the same time, 
he is also confirming the opinion of people who say that there 
is no difference between him and Benazir Bhutto. Both of them 
are willing to follow the agenda prepared by the World Bank and 
the IMF. We do not know if Nawaz Sharif and his associates are 
aware of it. 
  Becoming a prisoner of one's political image is a common 
tendency in politics. Mr. Nawaz Sharif is imprisoned by his 
political image to a dangerous level. This could be perilous for 
his political future. It is true that his political image is his 
greatest political asset, however, this asset could push him 
towards political insolvency. This image is as bad as it looks 
good from the outside. However, he does not think it necessary 
to make any change in or addition to his image. Although, his 
political image does not have any elements of dictatorial 
practices, he is still showing dictatorial tendencies even after 
losing his seat of power. He has not admitted, not even hinted, 
that he has made mistakes in the past. He has disappointed his 
supporters by constantly saying that he was right and everyone 
else was wrong. It is not only difficult, but may be impossible 
for him to return to power with this frozen political image. 
  The fact that Benazir Bhutto is demonstrating political 
adaptability merits attention. Even her political opponents are 
forced to change their opinion of her. Opposed to her, Nawaz 
Sharif who is known for adaptability seems to be a prisoner of 
his frozen image and the conventions that go with it. This will 
be a major hurdle in his political mobility and efforts for 
political penetration. 
  Madam Bhutto's long campaign against Ghulam Ishaq Khan and 
later her compromise with him may have helped her to return to 
power, however, it hurt her total image very badly. This harm 
could not be measured correctly as she came to power soon after 
that. The campaign that Mr. Nawaz Sharif was running against 
Benazir Bhutto, instead of against the PPP, could harm him if 
there is an occasion where he may have to cooperate (even 
temporarily) with Benazir Bhutto. This could become a problem 
for Nawaz Sharif's image. 
  Mr. Mohammed Nawaz Sharif's political future depends on all 
these factors. Let us see how much attention will he give to 
these facts. At present, he does not seem to be attending to 
these.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan-China Nuclear Scandal"] </F>
  [Text] Dr. Sher Afghan, federal minister for social welfare 
and special education, has expressed concern about the nuclear 
power plant being built with the Chinese assistance at Chashma, 
including the fact that the new system of safety precautions 
that China is using here has never been tested before. 
Therefore, it is necessary to be extremely careful. He mentioned 
a nuclear accident in Russia. He revealed that the electricity 
produced at the power plant China will help built cost three 
rupees per unit. The prices of another power plant is lower and 
it can be built in shorter period. It will produce more 
electricity and will cost only 50 paise per unit. 
  What the honored minister has said appears to be 
unbelievable 
since electricity produced in nuclear plants is considered to be 
the cheapest in the world. At present the electricity provided 
for domestic use in Pakistan costs less than one rupee per unit. 
In the light of this information, how can we believe that the 
nuclear power plant that our government is purchasing from the 
Chinese government will produce electricity at three rupees per 
unit. Who will buy electricity at this rate since there is a lot 
of anger in the country over the present electricity rates. How 
will the people react when there will be a 400 percent increase? 
Who will be able to tolerate the change from 100 rupees to 400 
rupees in the electricity bill? 
  The federal social welfare minister said that the 
electricity 
plant being built at Hab will produce electricity at 50 paise 
per unit. If it is true then the question is why should not we 
built similar electricity generating plants. Why should we buy a 
power plant which will produce electricity at three rupees per 
unit and whose safety is also suspect? 
  Dr. Sher Afghan grants that Madam Benazir Bhutto had made 
the 
deal for the Chashma nuclear power plant during her previous 
administration. He also claims that during Mian Nawaz Sharif's 
government the original deal was changed in such a way that it 
is a losing deal for Pakistan now. He admits that this amended 
agreement was approved by a group of Pakistani officials which 
included some nuclear experts. This strange circumstance shows 
that China did not warn Pakistan about the harmful aspects of 
the amended agreement, although China is a kind of friend who 
would never advise us to go into a losing deal. 
  It appears that Dr. Sher Afghan is trying to create bad 
feeling about Pakistan's great friend China while Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto is there on her visit. Which power is it that our 
minister is trying to please and does she not want our trusted 
friendship with China to prosper? 
  Dr. Sher Afghan is the first minister from whom the law 
portfolio was taken a few days ago and then the present position 
was given to him. It appears that his political mind does not 
agree with the PPP government. Suspicions are being expressed 
that he receives instructions from a specific place, which is 
especially dear to him. Anyway, the facts that he has revealed 
about the Chinese nuclear power plant in his interview have 
created a nuclear scandal. Now the people want to know all the 
facts. If the Chinese nuclear electricity plant is unsafe and 
the electricity produced here is going to be very expensive, the 
prime minister should review this nuclear project during her 
visit to China. On her return she should explain the details to 
the nation so that the people know how much truth there is in 
what one of her ministers has said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Need To Control Inflation"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was elected one month 
ago. This short time is not enough to evaluate a newly elected 
government's efficiency. Even though during this short period 
Benazir Bhutto has achieved many things, the results of these 
achievements have not reached the people. Therefore, even 
knowing that not much can be achieved in one month, the people 
are dissatisfied and worried. Perhaps they are wondering if they 
will benefit from the change in the government. If there are 
benefits, when will they reach the people's level? 
  The People's Party was successful in the general elections 
in 
October, and was also successful in getting its party's people 
elected as the speaker and deputy speaker in the National 
Assembly. This was followed by the success of Mr. Farooq Laghari 
in the presidential election. All of these have important 
political ramifications. Because of these successes, the prime 
minister is in a position now to focus on implementing her 
election promises to work for the country's security and the 
welfare of the people. If we look at it in this context, we must 
say that these successes will benefit the people. That is why 
the People's Party members are expressing joy at these 
accomplishments. However, the people, who are already expressing 
joy at the success of the newly elected government, are also 
expressing some minor disappointments. Perhaps all of this is 
because the people have been stuck in the vortex of inflation 
and unemployment for a long time. They want to get out of it 
immediately. They have high hopes for Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto and her government. They are becoming restless about 
fulfilling their expectations as soon as possible. 
  The situation demands that the newly elected government, in 
addition to implementing additional parliamentary victories and 
plans, also take immediate steps that help the poor, the middle 
class, and salaried people. These steps should be clear and to 
the point, so that an average man can feel and understand their 
importance and benefits. 
  Prime Minister Bhutto called a meeting of economic experts 
soon after her election, and expressed concern over the 
continued increase in prices of essential items. She instructed 
them to find ways to control these prices. The results of the 
steps they took should have been felt by the people by now. The 
people will be satisfied with these results only when inflation 
is reduced. They will learn about them when they go to purchase 
their daily necessities in the market, and find that they do not 
have to pay more than they did yesterday. As a first step, there 
should be stability in prices. The next step should be 
reductions in the prices of necessary items. The people are not 
ready to listen to the government experts' excuses about the 
economy, unless it will result in the stabilization of prices in 
the first phase, and reduction in the second phase. 
  Those who earn a few hundred or a few thousand rupees a 
month 
understand their economy much better than any economic expert, 
because the experts earn heavy salaries and benefits. They 
discuss economic philosophies in fancy offices, furnished with 
expensive furniture and rugs, located in posh buildings. They 
are removed from the facts of life, and are unable to understand 
the real problems of the poor. 
  In addition to controlling inflation, employment 
opportunities should also be increased. To this end, the 
restrictions and the hiring freeze government and 
semi-government agencies and departments should be removed. 
People should be hired on the basis of their abilities and 
experience to fill the vacated positions. At the same time, mid- 
and long-range plans should be made to create new employment 
opportunities. These are the immediate steps that will result in 
people being satisfied, and they will feel that the change in 
the government is benefiting them.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Plans To Decrease Budget Deficit"] </F>
  [Text] In 1985, when the martial law leadership had to hold 
elections under national and international pressure, Ziaul Haq 
had rearranged his priorities all over again. Under it he made 
plans to have the 8th Amendment approved by the newly elected 
assembly members, who were actually the political version of the 
counselors. When the amendment reached the House, there was a 
check for 500,000 rupees in the files given to the members for 
developmental plans. In other words, the martial law regime had 
used national resources mercilessly just to get some political 
support. This practice did not stop here. It spread to allotment 
of land plots, the issuing of loans and then writing them off, 
and the distribution of land for the armed forces personnel. 
This way the bureaucracy becomes more powerful in nondemocratic 
governments and such governments depend on it. Their expenses 
include unnecessary luxuries. Now the situation is so bad that 
13 percent of the total budget is spent on administrative 
expenses while less than 2.5 percent of the budget is allocated 
for health and education. 
  After General Zia's death, his followers followed the same 
method to strengthen their nondemocratic governments. The fact 
that they could not save their governments and that our country 
could not escape from their abuses is a separate issue. Now the 
situation is that investors have 60 billion rupees in loans from 
the banks and it will require a major operation to make them pay 
those loans back. Anyhow, this system which the martial law 
regime had started was strengthened by the governments that 
followed it. The control of bureaucracy over the government 
continued to increase in a royal manner and the assembly members 
continued to receive funds for developmental plans in addition 
to loans and land plots. Government's unproductive expenses also 
continued to increase, inflation spiraled, currency notes were 
printed, the people sank deeper in the quicksand of rising 
prices, rulers become rich overnight, and the budget deficit 
went up to 120 billion rupees. The country, thus, is facing a 
serious crisis. 
  Keeping this situation in mind, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto's government has issued instructions to reduce the budget 
deficit and has made plans to reduce unnecessary expenses to 
bring down the deficit of 120 billion rupees to 42 billion 
rupees during the next two years. The prime minister has ordered 
V.A. Jaffery, minister for finance and trade affairs, to issue a 
report soon. According to the finance minister and the Planning 
Commission, a huge amount was taken from the State Bank, and 
unproductive expenses were increased during Nawaz Sharif's 
government. This has increased the budget deficit. Many agencies 
were given additional assistance which emptied the treasury. The 
government has instructed all ministries and departments to live 
within their budgets and not to request additional funds. At the 
same time, plans are made to make tax administration more 
effective and to get the loans back. During the former 
administration, businessmen were given various forms of support 
to get help from them. Finance Minister Jaffery will meet with 
the business community to inform them of government's problems 
and request their cooperation. 
  The PPP [Pakistan People's Party] government has always made 
progress in starting developmental projects for the people and 
providing stability to nation's economy. That is why whenever 
the government was under the PPP, not only did the standard of 
life improve, but the country's economy was also put on firm 
ground, and inflation and the budget deficit were reduced. Madam 
Bhutto's present steps are part of these efforts. However, the 
recovery will not be easy in the present situation, especially 
because of the innumerable problems in getting international 
assistance, and the actions of the previous administration which 
resulted in unproductive activities. The money received in aid 
was left with some favorite people to spend at their discretion 
instead of using it for the purpose it was given to us. This led 
to looting of these funds, affecting Pakistan's prestige at the 
international level, and the aid was stopped. The political 
changes also changed preference for livelihood. Pakistan was 
effected just like other countries. 
  In this situation, the prime minister's decision can 
definitely be called a significant step in establishing economic 
stability. However, it is important that we make sure that these 
plans are implemented. It should have a "check" system to 
rectify problems and pave the way for achieving this goal.

<F P=106> [Editorial" View From the State Bank"] </F>
  [Text] Economic deterioration had reached alarming 
proportions during the previous financial year. This has been 
confirmed by the latest State Bank annual report which cites 
fiscal policy as one of the weakest areas of economic 
management. To meet the widening budget deficit, the government 
borrowed for budgetary support Rs [rupees] 63 billion against 
the whole year's target of Rs 25 billion. If the borrowing by 
autonomous corporations is also included, this figure would go 
up to Rs 129 billion. It should, therefore, not come as a 
surprise that Pakistan's total GDP [Gross Domestic Product] is 
mortgaged by debts to the extent of 86 percent. Financial 
discipline has rarely been the strong point of economy but 
during the 1992-93 financial year it seems to have been totally 
discounted. It was only in the later half of the year that some 
demand management measures were initiated but the economy had 
already been subjected to serious strains. 
  With an economic growth at three percent, the same as the 
rate of growth of population, there was no increase in per 
capita income. The growth in the agriculture sector declined 
from 9.7 percent to minus 3.7 percent, and that of the 
manufacturing sector from 8.3 to 5.6 percent. Exports growth 
fell from 14.6 to 0.4 percent, but imports went up from 7.3 to 
9.9 percent. Trade account recorded a deficit of 3.1 billion 
dollars causing a sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves 
from 1,012 million dollars to 461 million dollars by the end of 
June last year. Heavy borrowing by the government and an 
excessive monetary expansion at 24 percent had a cripling effect 
on inflation whichs went into double digits and was recorded at 
10.3 percent. The State Bank feels that price indices suffer 
from technical deficiencies and inaccuracies which would suggest 
that price pressures have accentuated more than these indices 
reflect. The decline in national savings from 17 percent to 14.6 
percent is an inevitable consequence. 
  Against such dismal performance of the economy, the targets 
set for this year underscore the need for financial discipline 
and concerted efforts. It has been proposed to achieve an 
economic growth of 7.5 percent, bring down inflation to 8 
percent, build up foreign exchange reserves up to 1.3 billion 
dollars and reduce the budget deficit to 5.4 percent of the 
gross domestic product. Last year budgetary deficit was as high 
as 7.9 percent. Monetary expansion will be restricted to 14.5 
percent. Already the [passage indistinct] effort in the budget 
was its [words indistinct]. The report makes a special mention 
of the demand management and resource generation measures 
introduced during the term of the caretakers. The caretaker 
government had raised additional resources worth Rs.17 billion. 
For the current year, the nation has already been subjected to a 
heavy dose of taxation and any further burden on it is to be 
avoided. 
  The SBP [State Bank of Pakistan] report is of the view that 
it is too early to evaluate the outcome for the current 
financial year, but developments so far on the supply as well as 
on the demand side would indicate that the continuation of the 
reform measures and tight demand management policies pursued in 
the first half of the year will lead to higher growth, 
containment of inflation and improvement in the balance of 
payments. After having regained its autonomy, it is to be hoped 
that the State Bank will, through a balanced monetary policy, 
help to keep a lid on government borrowing, control monetary 
expansion within the target and contain inflation. The role of 
the central bank in keeping the economy on course is as 
important as that of the economic policy managers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "State Bank Report"] </F>
  [Text] The State Bank has called the preceding year a 
difficult year from the economic perspective in its annual 
report. According to this report, for the first time in many 
years, there has been no increase in per capita income in 
Pakistan. The export situation is also the same. Foreign 
exchange reserves have been reduced dramatically and prices have 
increased rapidly. The report further added that no increase was 
seen in collection of taxes as indicated by the GDP. The public 
sector established a record in borrowing. The State Bank also 
declared the present rate of inflation to be wrong. 
  The report issued by the State Bank presents to us a very 
serious picture of our country's economy. There are two major 
reasons for it. First is natural catastrophes and the second is 
political uncertainty and confrontations. There is no doubt that 
heavy rains and floods seriously damaged standing crops and 
harmed the basic structure and personal property in most areas. 
Cotton, rice, and sugar cane crops were ruined as the result of 
it. After continuous increase in our agriculture, this year we 
faced reduction for the first time. Thirty percent of our cotton 
production was destroyed by floods. Since exports depend on 
cotton and cotton products, there has been no increase in 
exports which Pakistan needs badly. Another major reason for 
decline in exports is the unsuitable situation abroad. Market 
slump around the world, change in trade rules, and the negative 
affects of stiff competition in the international market have 
all influenced the exports. It is important to pay immediate 
attention to these problems. Heavy rains and floods have 
affected our basic economic structure in addition to damaging 
crops, which in turn directly affect industrial production. 
Improved basic economic structure is important for establishing 
new industries. Unfortunately, the basic structure did not 
improve, instead, it hurt the present services. This also needs 
immediate attention. One major reason for our economic woes is 
said to be political uncertainty. The truth is that there was 
irreparable damage to our country because of the confrontation 
between the president and the prime minister. Not only were the 
plans already being implemented affected adversely, but foreign 
investors were also discouraged. Our politicians should learn 
from the bitter experiences of the past and give up the politics 
of confrontation. They should find solutions to all 
controversial issues through negotiation and understanding. As 
for the increase in inflation and prices, it appears the 
independent economic experts do not find it easy to agree with 
the figures released by the government. Repeatedly, we have also 
expressed concern about inflation and increasing prices in these 
columns. The main reasons for this are the wrong economic 
policies. The basic reasons for inflation and price increases 
are the unchecked spread of currency notes, decrease in cuts in 
government spending, budget deficit, unchecked increase in 
unproductive expenses, and the public sector's borrowing money 
from banks just to meet routine expenses. This is not only 
harming our economic system, but also affecting the rate of 
savings and investments. The State Bank has also proposed an 
action program to improve the economy in its report to the 
government. It asks to reduce inflation, federal budget deficit, 
and proliferation of currency. International economic 
organizations have been putting pressure on Pakistan in this 
area. It is a relief to know that the newly elected government 
is giving priority to it. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has more 
than once declared her plans to reduce inflation, budget 
deficit, and unproductive expenses. She had also made some 
progress in this respect during her first government. Let us 
hope that concrete steps will be taken to rectify the problems 
identified in the State Bank report and the suggested plans are 
implemented to speed up our economic development.

  [Text] The State Bank has recently advised the government 
to keep in mind the country's situation and be very careful in 
hiring new employees. The finance minister for the present 
government, who was also the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] 
finance minister in 1988, has given us the good news that the 
nation's foreign exchange reserves have doubled since the PPP 
government's rise to power because of its better economic 
policies. By following instruction to reduce the deficit from 
eight percent to three percent over the next three years, the 
rate of inflation at the time he took over the ministry has 
fallen from 15 percent, to nine percent through its efforts. It 
should be remembered that international financial organizations 
were hinting at reducing the deficit to five percent. Madam 
Bhutto, by ordering a reduction of the deficit to three percent, 
has made a strong decision to help the common people. Within a 
short period her government has decided to borrow money to a 
limited extent. According to V. V. Jaffery, the amount of 
government loans from the State Bank has been reduced, and this 
may help bring down the loans from 35 billion to 11 billion 
rupees. There is no doubt that during the previous government no 
prudence was practiced in the economic area. However, we should 
keep in mind that it was not only Nawaz Sharif's government that 
had ruined our economy. His teacher, Ziaul Haq, was so 
indecisive in financial issues that the dangerous results are 
still in front of the people now. The caretaker government had 
openly admitted that because of the actions of the previous 
government, the country was on the brink of insolvency. It is 
the responsibility of the present government, seeing the 
economic misappropriations that have happened, to work hard to 
put our economy on a strong footing. Their efforts will also 
help the country's work force. Not only the government, but 
every person in the nation must participate in this effort. They 
do not have to follow the example of the previous government and 
try to push the country's economy into a blind well. Instead, it 
must take steps to build a bright economic future. It is the 
responsibility of the Central Bank to maintain economic 
stability in the country. But Zia never understood this 
responsibility, because the Afghanistan war made Ziaul Haq a 
favorite of the United States. It gave foreign aid to Pakistan 
without any restrictions, and Ziaul Haq continued to increase 
internal and foreign debts because of his unskilled economic 
policies. The Nawaz group also followed this path, and control 
of the Central Bank remained in the government's hands. Because 
of this, prices, inflation, and the budget deficit continued to 
increase, and the Nawaz government tried to avoid the problem by 
printing additional currency notes. By keeping the State Bank 
under government control, he had the National Bank issue huge 
loans to his favorite people at nominal interest rates. He also 
caused an economic crisis in the country by allowing these 
people to open new banks without approval from the State Bank. 
  The caretaker government studied the whole situation and 
issued an ordinance to make the State Bank independent in 
October 1993. The present finance minister has followed this 
decision, saying that old loans must be returned to the banks, 
and that the process to collect taxes must be accelerated. This 
is a good, solid plan by the government, and, if its claims 
prove to be realistic, the people will see stability in 
Pakistan's economic system. Inflation and the budget deficit 
will also be controlled. Therefore, it is imperative for Madam 
Bhutto and her economic experts to follow the ordinance of the 
caretaker government, which had given autonomy to the State 
Bank, approved in the National Assembly, so that the country 
follows the path of economic discipline. This way our national 
economy will be able to stand on its own feet without depending 
on anyone else, and government workers will be able to take a 
sigh of relief and be proud that they are working for the 
government. This will reduce inflation. Madam Bhutto's goal is 
still far away because she wants to reduce inflation to below 
nine percent. However, these efforts are paving the way for 
attaining it. 
  The industrial sector could use various tricks to avoid 
paying taxes because they were close to Nawaz Sharif, and this 
hurt the country's economy very badly. They put the whole burden 
of their crime on the low-income salaried people. In 1977, the 
people that Ziaul Haq had gathered around him came mostly from 
industrial families. After 1985, new institutions emerged in 
front of the people, and the balance of power went in favor of 
the business and industrial sector after the army's priority. 
Money became more important than faith and religion in the 
country. These people used this power to gain important 
political clout. They played with the rules and declared some 
areas industrially frozen and tax-free zones. Investors 
purchased huge acreage there and then sold them for large 
profits. They earned huge amounts, but did not give one rupee to 
the treasury in taxes. They profited in many areas this way. The 
State Bank instructed banks and financial institutions that they 
must receive an OC for any loan over one million rupees. In 
addition, they are not to issue new loans until old ones are 
paid. If we follow these steps strictly, then the causes of 
unemployment will die their own death in our country. We should 
start plans that make it necessary for our government to take 
loans from inside or outside the country. Programs, as decided 
by President Leghari, should be started to develop the backward 
and underdeveloped areas of the country. In order to alleviate 
the problem of insufficient health services, we must make sure 
that every citizen has access to medical services. If the 
government takes strict action to take back the loans worth 59 
billion rupees from various industrial organizations, it would 
be a welcome development for the people, and the plans and 
projects started with this money would provide additional 
employment to the people. The previous government passed the 
limit of a 100 billion rupee budget deficit during its tenure. 
It will be reduced by the return of these debts.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Managing the debt problem"] </F>
  [Text] According to reports Pakistan repaid $508 million in 
principle and interest on foreign debt only during the first 
three months of the current fiscal year. This indicates the 
growing problem of our debt servicing liability at a time when 
not only our exports have begun to stagnate but remittances from 
overseas Pakistanis -- once a major redeeming feature of our 
external budget -- are also shrinking substantially. 
  Here is a problem which now requires special attention and 
careful handling. An update on the 1992-93 Economic Survey has 
recorded that debt service payments for that whole year totalled 
$1.645 billion of which $646 million were only interest 
payments. If total debt servicing liability is deducted from the 
year's disbursements in foreign assistance, that net external 
flow is around $800 million. Looked at from another angle, debt 
servicing was more than 24 percent of our export receipts, more 
than 15 percent of all foreign exchange earnings and more than 
three percent of our Gross National Product (GNP). Remittances, 
which in 1982-83 soared to more than $2.8 billion, have now 
slumped to about $1.5 billion. 
  In case of major donors like the US, Japan, Germany and two 
international financial institutions -- the World Bank and the 
Asian Development Bank -- repayments pre-empt a big portion of 
new inflows. In case of the US, which has suspended new loans or 
concessional credits, we are perhaps exporting capital rather 
than importing it. Annual repayments to the US in 1992-93 were 
around $350 million -- much more than what is still flowing from 
the pipeline as economic assistance. If repayments on military 
purchases are added, the scenario becomes more worrisome. 
  Pakistan has so far scrupulously avoided any default or 
sought any new debt relief or re-scheduling. But it is perhaps 
time to review the whole situation more comprehensively. It is 
unlikely that in the immediate future there will be any dramatic 
upturn in our exports. We seem to have good case for seeking 
rescheduling or debt relief of some kind to tide over the 
present situation. IMF assistance, now under negotiation, may 
not be adequate for a year or two. The forthcoming Donors 
meeting this spring may be the right forum to stimulate some 
dialogue on this issue. In the meantime, Pakistan should, in 
concert with other developing countries, press for a new 
North-South settlement on the debt problem for the third world 
as a whole.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Plans To Build Ships and Submarines"] </F>
  [Text] Admiral Sayyed M. Khan, commander-in-chief of the 
Pakistan Navy, said that Pakistan is planning to build war ships 
in cooperation with China within one year. He said that new 
submarines are being bought to replace the old ones. The country 
with which this agreement will be made will also be required to 
transfer the related technology to Pakistan. Pakistan is 
endangered by serious foreign threats now. Keeping this in mind, 
we cannot be negligent about out national defense. The Pakistani 
Navy especially needs naval war ships and submarines, because 
India has increased its naval power extraordinarily, much more 
than it really needs. This clearly indicates that India wants to 
establish its monopoly in the Indian Ocean and to change it to a 
"Hindu lake." In addition, India has made so much progress in 
this area that it can block all trade and naval routes to 
Pakistan if there is a war. In this era, the importance of 
technology and modern war equipment has increased considerably. 
Needs and demands change every few years. But it is deplorable 
that we have not paid full attention to the Pakistani Navy's 
needs for a long time. As a result, most of the ships and 
submarines in Pakistan's Navy are old and useless . The war 
ships that were leased from the United States of America have 
been returned. The war ships loaned by Great Britain to replace 
those do not have all the same capabilities and features. Thus, 
it is a welcome development that the Pakistan Navy is not only 
trying to purchase modern war ships and submarines from another 
country, but also is preparing to build these here under the 
technology transfer arrangement. In addition, naval war ships 
will be built with the cooperation of China, which will help 
Pakistan become self-sufficient in its defense. This will also 
rid Pakistan of any blackmail efforts for procuring military 
equipment in the case of a war.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pak-Sino Defense Cooperation"] </F>
  [Text] During the Pakistani defense minister's trip to 
China, discussions were held on the proposed plan to build 
Chinese MBD-2000 tanks in Pakistan. China and Pakistan are not 
only neighboring nations, but also have extended trade, 
cultural, and historical relations. China has helped Pakistan a 
lot in its effort for economic development. Pakistan should be 
especially proud about the dedication shown by Chinese engineers 
in building the Silk Road. This highway has helped connect both 
countries. Whenever there were bad times for Pakistan, China 
always extended a helping hand. Since U. S. military and 
economic aid to Pakistan has been stopped, Pakistan is looking 
for an alternate source of help, and China has never shown any 
hesitation in helping us. China is working on many plans with us 
to make Pakistan's defense stronger and more stable. Among 
these, the building of tanks tops the list. Despite U. S. anger 
and unhappiness, Pakistan has made important progress in 
building missiles with China's help. The HATF-1 and HATF-2 are 
worth mentioning here. The United States is also very angry at 
China for providing missile technology to Pakistan, and is 
threatening China every other day. The friendship and 
brotherhood of the Chinese are praiseworthy, because they were 
not affected by these threats. With the help of Chinese 
expertise and technical assistance, Pakistan can progress in 
every area. Though the United States is blocking these efforts 
at every occasion, Pakistan should keep the Chinese example in 
front of it and not accept any foreign pressure. The way China 
responded to the combined U. S. and former Soviet Union pressure 
can be a guiding principle for Pakistan. Because of the close 
relationship between Pakistan and China, a new series of 
conspiracies is being hatched at the international level. On one 
side, there are indications of new external interference in 
Pakistan's northern region, and on the other, a solution to the 
Kashmir problem is being worked out that would change Kashmir 
into an independent country and a United States military base. 
This way, the United States would use the base to carry out its 
conspiracies against Pakistan and China. After the 
disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the world's balance 
of power has been destroyed, and a new rivalries and power 
struggles have started. In order to protect ourselves from it, 
it is important that a new power bloc composed of China, 
Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Central Asian Muslim 
Republics be established. Pakistan can play an important role, 
because of its geographic location, in bringing China and other 
countries together. The government of Pakistan should take the 
necessary steps immediately to realize this goal. Only this way 
can we counter the challenge of the New World order.

<F P=106> [News Report: "Plans To Build Modern super-tank' With </F>
Chinese Help"] 
  [Text] Beijing (AFP) -- Pakistan and China have started 
negotiations over plans to build "super-tanks" for the Pakistani 
armed forces. Mr. Aftab Sh'aban Mirani, Pakistan's defense 
minister, is currently visiting China. Talks were held on the 
proposed plan of building MBT-2000 tanks. Pakistani Defense 
Minister Aftab Sh'aban Mirani, Chinese Defense Minister Chi 
Hutian, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Liu Ho 
Chiang participated in these discussions. Chinese technology 
will be used to build these tanks in Pakistan, and these tanks 
will be in the same class as Russian T-72 tanks, German 
Leopard-2 tanks, and the U. S. Abraham. This plan has been 
shelved for several years because of restrictions on Pakistan's 
nuclear program. 
  Mirani also visited a tank factory in Mongolia, where T-85 
tanks are built for Pakistan. The Pakistani defense minister is 
visiting China at a time when a Chinese military deputation is 
holding talks in Islamabad about providing aid to Pakistan. The 
Pakistani army is obtaining facts in order to counter 
neighboring India. Pakistan is expected to get 200 tanks; 
however, no talks have been finalized.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Large-scale production of indigenously 
built Al-Khalid tanks which was initially scheduled for year 
2000 will now begin from 1997, a well-placed army source 
confided to the PAKISTAN OBSERVER here Wednesday. 
  According to the source in the second phase during the year 
1994-95 prototype field exercises will take place for giving it 
final shape before its large-scale production for the induction 
in the Pakistan Army. 
  Defence observers believe that the induction of Al-Khalid 
tanks, which are being built in Heavy Industries, Taxila (HTT) 
in collaboration with China, would surely narrow the 
quantitative gap in armour between Pakistan and India. 
  It may be recalled that first phase of Al-Khalid project has 
already been completed and the prototype have undergone trials 
in Pakistan in various conditions. Experts from China and 
Pakistan are now exploring further methods for improving the 
tanks with more powerful engine, better fire control and 
electronic system, before its production, source added saying 
"production line would be expanded to manufacture in such a 
number that can meet the country's defence requirement 
adequately". 
  It is also worth mentioning here that the Chief of the Army 
Staff General Abdul Waheed after taking over as army chief in 
January this year is said to have directed the army authorities 
to also examine the possibility of buying other types of tanks 
including the Chinese T-85. Two-hundred T-85 Chinese tanks are 
already in the process of being inducted in the Pakistan Army as 
a part of Pak-Sino deal signed earlier. Pakistan Army has 
budgeted a total of 311 million dollars for the purchase of new 
tanks over the next three years. 
  A deal for buying T-691 IMP from China has also materialised 
which will further strengthen the defence line of Pakistan 
against any external threat.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Federal Defence Minister Aftab 
Shazban Mirani Wednesday informed the National Assembly that the 
defence production division had earned US 84,949,421.63 dollars 
during the last three years. 
  Replying to a question during question hour the minister 
said 
out of the total amount Pakistan Ordnance Factories, Wah, earned 
US75,785,800 dollars, while Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, 
Kamar, earned 9,163,621.63 dollars. 
  The parliamentary secretary for petroleum and natural 
resources, replying to a supplementary question from Chaudhry 
Nisar ali, said the plan approved during 1992-93 for providing 
natural gas to 120 odd towns would continue without any change. 
  To another supplementary from the PML(N) [Pakistan Muslim 
League (Nawaz)] leader, Iftikhar Hussain Gilani, the secretary 
said Kohat was included in the list of towns to be provided gas 
in the near future. 
  The defence minister, answering another question, said at 
present PLA [People's Liberation Army] was operating weekly 
Boeing 737 service on Karachi-Rahimyar Khan-Multan- Karachi 
route. He said PLA had no plans to introduce any other Boeing 
737 flight to Rahimyar Khan. 
  Answering a question from Raja Afzal, the minister in charge 
of communications, said the government had abolished the 
Islamabad- Peshawar motorway project. 
  He said the decision was taken due to lack of effective 
traffic demand for such a motorway, noninclusion of project in 
the master plan for road transportation and the 7th five year 
plan's lack of resources and existence of highways in the same 
traffic corridor, which were sufficient to cater traffic needs 
till the year 2005. He said it was thus a bad project which had 
created distortions in the economy and was therefore abandoned. 
  In another written reply the communication minister said 
according to the contract agreement work on Lahore-Islamabad 
motorway would be completed by July 30, 1955 and up to date 
progress on the motorway was 20 percent. 
  The minister in charge for education, answering a question 
from Yasin Wattoo, said it was decided by the government in 1989 
that English be taught as an additional language from class one 
in schools, where medium of instruction was Urdu or an approved 
provincial language. 
  To another question, he said 123 students were sent abroad 
during the tenure of the IJI [Islami Jamhoori Ittehad] 
government.

<F P=106> [Article by Yasar Rizvi: "Need To Stop Foreign Cultural </F>
Invasion"] 
  [Text] The Pakistani people, showing their full faith in 
the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] in a huge majority, have given 
this party its third opportunity in the nation's history to form 
a government. After taking over the government, it is its 
responsibility to make good on its election promises and focus 
on changing the condition of the people. It is a welcome 
development that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has issued an 
ordinance to fulfill her election promises. Pakistan is an 
Islamic nation. It was established on the Islamic principle. In 
addition to protecting the nation's physical boundaries, it is 
the foremost duty of the government to protect its ideological 
boundaries. A country that is ideologically weak suffers from 
internal strife; an example is the recent division in the Soviet 
Union. In contrast, an ideologically strong nation can overcome 
all difficult and testing problems. The latest example of this 
is Afghanistan, which defeated a superpower and is busy building 
a new country. After Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan, Pakistan is 
the strongest fort of Islam. All those satanic forces that want 
to hurt Muslims are focusing their ugly eyes on Pakistan. In 
these modern times, any country can be weakened without any 
military action by weakening it on the inside. Therefore, the 
easiest system for it is to affect any country's ideological 
perspective in the name of culture. This way, one can bring 
about a revolution according to their wishes. In Pakistan, under 
this cultural campaign, and in the name of cultural heritage, 
innocent minds are being made prey. The electronic media is 
airing programs which are opposed to our Islamic and cultural 
beliefs. These are nothing more than meaningless noise. They are 
using inconceivable language, strange clothing, jiggling bodies, 
and trying to put these ideas in the minds of the people, as if 
this is our culture. All this is done by the 
government-controlled electronic media. The hand that holds the 
pen and the mind that represents purity are both being eroded by 
shameless and wayward behavior. If we do not stop this spreading 
flood, then it will drown our traditional and cultural pride. 
This country was not made easily, and we will not let it become 
a victim of foreign conspiracies. It was not established by the 
sacrifices of some joker. The devout blood of innumerable young 
men was shed on this land. Its progress is the result of the 
hard work of thousands of young people. That is how the dawn of 
independence emerged finally to give light to the lightless 
eyes. We request of the federal cultural minister that he stop 
the spread of this flood with his wisdom and strategy. We hope 
that he will take some action immediately and will keep his 
promise.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Rajeshwari Prasad Singh: " Dunkel Proposal: A </F>
Conspiracy to Impoverish the Nation"] 
  [Text] Forty-six years after independence, when a series of 
events are taking place very rapidly around the world, India 
appears to be directionless and stuck in a whirlpool of problems 
trying to stay above water. India is standing there dumbfounded 
by these problems such as increasing population; reemergence of 
ethnic and caste-related prejudices in human relations; control 
over government, communication, education, and economic 
structure by one-fourth of the population; arrival of the 
American dragons--the multi-national companies--to devour our 
culture and national identity; the society stuck in the 
quicksand of myopia caused by the lose of self-confidence while 
battling the standards of consumerism; loss of selfhood because 
of self-doubts, indecisiveness; and helplessness of major 
leaders engrossed in power and divided among themselves. 
  The spineless people hiding behind their seats of power are 
giving very weak reasons in support of the GATT proposals. Even 
a scholarly member of the Parliament Manishanker Ayyer has gone 
to extremes and supported the signing of this agreement. He 
said, "Since India had signed the original GATT proposals in 
1948, it should sign those now." Mr. Ayyer and such ineffectual 
thinkers should see why France, European nations, Australia, and 
Japan are so interested in forwarding their interests in pacts 
signed in Brussels to Geneva. Many of these countries had sang 
the songs of praise when GATT was born in 1948. What special 
place did India get at the international platform? GATT is a 
sacrificial alter and the Dunkel is the sword. Geneva is the 
place where they sacrifice developing countries to satisfy the 
U.S. thirst for riches and for other developed nations, and 
Peter Southerland is Shiva. The only way to establish Ramrajya 
[ideal government] is to stop Meghnath's yagna. 
  The various varieties of carnivorous plants representing the 
U.S. ambitions born out of the rubble of communist regimes are 
dazzling us and pulling at us. The U.S. President, the secretary 
of state, and groups of senators and officials are roaming the 
world. The U.S. hunger for power has used the rungs of APAC, 
ASEAN, and NAFTA to reach the treasure of GATT. From among 116 
countries only 20 or 22 countries are involved in the nominal 
tug-of-war of vested interests against the United States. Mickey 
Cantor, the U.S. representative, and Sir Leo Briton, who is 
representing the 12 European nations, are moving the pawns of 
their interests very carefully. The United States is forced to 
make changes in the agreement for the European interests. Even a 
country like Belgium is proudly announcing that it can boot the 
American proposals and GATT out in the context of issues related 
to television and films, because protecting culture is more 
important than the business interests. The Cannes Trade Group, a 
group of 14 nations under the leadership of Australia, can 
create new problems. South Korea may be forced to open doors to 
import rice, but the Japanese Prime Minister Hata is keeping 
Geneva at bay from Tokyo. 
  Japan is in the process of taking a plebiscite over the GATT 
proposals. Dr. Mahatir, prime minster of Malaysia, has boycotted 
APAC and shown the courage to call it a vehicle to protect U.S. 
interests. France has got its stand on giving subsidy to the 
farmers approved, and still is arguing about the issues related 
to film and airplane industries. Some African nations have 
started to make noise about their products--coffee and 
cocoa--becoming cheaper. President Clinton himself sat on the 
negotiation table to show respect for China and with great 
respect offered the gift of supercomputers to China. Only then 
APAC could be formed. The central theme of the NAFTA is 
exploiting cheap Mexican labor. The strategy to tie down India 
with the same fate as Argentina, Brazil, Latin American 
countries, and the Philippines has been very important. 
  India is an untapped market. The warmth of over 100,000 
[rupees] per annum income earned by 200 million upper middle 
class people is pushing us towards consumerism and luxuries. The 
remaining 700 million people have no alternative but to carry 
these 200 million wealthy people on their shoulders. 
  The Indian government has neither a vision nor the ability 
to 
unite and nor the life-giving source of popular support. We 
should have our share in GATT based on our need to survive. The 
fate of every citizen is tied to signing the GATT proposals. 
Very fine points of the Trips (Trade Related intellectual rights 
and biotechnology], Trims [trade related investment measures]), 
questions over MFN [most favored nation], and patents laws 
should have been discussed at the levels of universities and 
vidhan sabhas [state aeemblies]. The government should have 
received a mandate from the people and kept the nation's 
philosophy in its mind. If the United States is stubbornly 
trying to keep the restrictions on garment imports for 15 years 
instead of for 10 years, then our government should kick that 
stubbornness away. Make these Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola and Colgate 
people scram from here. 
  The 900 million Indian people have tolerated a lot. The 
multi-national companies are showing up here to exploit India's 
cheap labor, ample energy sources, and abundant raw materials 
and efforts are being made to bind India into the GATT trap. The 
pitcher is fraught with the sins of conspiracies of foreigners, 
particularly Americans such as the trick of not organizing the 
G-7 nations meeting along with the G-15 nations meeting, Mallot, 
Clinton, and Robin Raphael's tactics over Kashmir, interference 
in the cryogenic engine deal, spewing poison over the humans 
rights issue, improper pressure to sign the "shylock-type" NPT, 
intrusion into the kitchens of the people to sell their 
products, and first offering the tent of economic incentives and 
then putting on a military umbrella to protect their interests. 
  Vodka and wine from Russia is obtained and sold here, and 
the 
Russian companies are minting money by sending food and even 
pumpkins to Russia in exchange. Many foreign companies are 
processing mushrooms and making sea food for export. Pepsi has 
taken the lead in making profit by increasing the production of 
tomatoes. A company called Coopen Ritgeld is making agreements 
with farmers to grow cucumbers. The ITC has made an agreement 
with Geneva about developing seeds. It is the major export 
hordes, in whose laps these politicians born of the poor 
peoples' votes prosper, who are in a hurry to have the GATT 
agreement signed. 
  Where can an average man stand in this equation of political 
leaders, stock brokers, black marketeers, corrupt officials, 
intellectuals who are the slaves of multi-national companies, 
the CIA, journalists, and experts? Unemployment and prices of 
necessary items, illiteracy, and poverty are on the rise, and 
the value of humans is decreasing. In this situation, stop and 
think about what GATT will give you! What will it take back in 
return? What is this open market? These are the efforts to steal 
our literature, tradition, sciences, herbs, living organisms, 
knowledge, and trying to loot us by making the patent laws. We 
have been using the neem tree for thousands of years before 
America was discovered. Now, in the name of patents and 
intellectual properties, the neem in our backyard will become a 
U.S. property. What worse form of slavery is there?

<F P=106> [Article by Om Prakash: "India Bowed Down to the Dunkel </F>
Proposals"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 19 December. The Permanent Parliamentary 
Committee has given details of when and how India's attitude of 
submission to the Dunkel proposals and GATT in its report 
yesterday. Appropriate responses to two comments made by the 
Congress (I) in the Parliament is also included in this report. 
One comment was that V.P. Singh had discussed the agreement 
positively when he was India's finance minister in 1986 just 
before the Uruguay conference. The comment was used in a wrong 
way. It was mentioned in a way to imply that V.P. Singh had 
endorsed it in the Uruguay session. The second comment was 
questioning why the V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar governments 
did not get out of GATT? Why is the Narasimha Rao government 
being asked to get out of GATT? 
  The Permanent Committee of the commerce ministry after 
reviewing the report has raised the same concerns over the 
Dunkel proposals that are bothering the people around the 
country. According to this report, this whole agreement is a 
device to make all the developing countries economic colonies. 
The Permanent Committee warned that if there is even a small 
understanding of the history of verbal assurances, we should not 
trust them. Even the officials of GATT have said after repeated 
analysis that GATT has become an instrument in the hands of 
developed countries to crush the developing countries through 
trade. V.P. Singh's comments on this agreement are included in 
this report, and these show that India had not bowed down in the 
beginning. The report says that this will affect our country's 
autonomy and the interests of the poor will be affected. The 
real compliance began in April 1989. Rajiv Gandhi's government 
agreed that talks can be held with GATT over intellectual 
endowment. The second important turn was taken in January 1992 
and a few months before it. Anvarul Huda, then special secretary 
in the commerce ministry and now the assistant director of GATT, 
said, "India did not think it important to make final decision 
over Dunkel in January 1992. In the January 1992 agreement, all 
the participating nations had to present their final decision." 
If we look at the history, at a time when the whole world was 
ready to present a clear stand, the Indian government did not 
even want to discuss Dunkel proposals with any one. The actions 
of the governments led by V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar are 
written in the history. No decision was made over GATT during 
either of these two governments. 
  The Permanent Committee had presented its preliminary report 
to the Parliament on 10 May 1992. It had tried to warn in that 
report also. The history of GATT and the Uruguay conference 
fully shows how India is helpless and alone on this last chance 
to approve the Dunkel draft and how much control the United 
States has. For more than four decades, the international trade 
followed GATT regulations in customs tariffs. It was felt after 
the World War ll that there should be a common agreement on 
international trade. This agreement combined with the World 
Bank and the IMF gave a new form to the international economic 
system. It was believed that this organization would function 
without any bias and will keep in mind each nation's 
developmental needs to avoid wars like the WWII caused by 
economic rivalries. The goal was the protection of humanity, 
fairness, and equality. Therefore, 23 nations started a general 
agreement over trade and tariffs. This agreement later evolved 
into GATT. 
  However, the United States and its allies started their 
games 
soon after GATT was formed. The race to make the international 
trade their personal property started. The United States refused 
to accept the Havana Charter in 1948 and stopped the formation 
of the international trade organization. The United States had 
its eyes on controlling world trade after WWII and did not wish 
for any international body to control trade. Only an ad hoc 
organization like GATT, which it could pressure into submission, 
could protect its interests. GATT has been in this format for 
the last four decades. Its rules change depending on the needs 
of the United States. 
  The first five meetings of GATT were called just to give an 
international color to the U.S. mutual trade laws of 1934. When 
its trade increased in 1962, the GATT meeting of Kennedy era 
(1962-67) was held to absorb this increase. The Tokyo meeting of 
1973 was held to facilitate the proposed 1974 U.S. trade law. 
The Uruguay conference in 1986 was held to give an international 
form to it all-encompassing trade and competition law of 1988. 
It was clear during the '50s that GATT did not belong to all and 
was not to protect everyone's interests. After one decade, GATT 
concluded that it was not fair to the third world countries. The 
Herbler Committee made it clear to all. It said that the 
developed nations block consumption of third world countries' 
products. It was against the GATT rules. The developing 
countries brought this issue in the United Nation to stop this 
monopoly in GATT. At that time this organization still had some 
clout and the UNCTAD (United Nations Committee for Trade and 
Development) was formed. Its first general secretary, Raul 
Prebish, investigated GATT and concluded that it could not 
relate trade with the development structure. GATT had to accept 
under the pressure of the developing countries that developed 
nations and developing countries are not equal where trade was 
concerned. Every nation has its own unique developmental needs 
and this should be kept in mind when discussing trade. 
  However, the UNCTAD efforts were limited to paper only. The 
developing countries brought up GATT again in the Tokyo meeting 
and called it a club of few rich nations. It does not help poor 
nations' trade as is proved by its trade figures. In 1966, the 
developing countries had 11.2 percent share in the world trade. 
Twenty years later, in 1986, this share increased to 13.8. Thus 
GATT did not help reduce the trade chasm between the poor and 
rich nations. This situation of status quo was until 1986. At 
that time GATT only decided customs and tariff rates. It was not 
used to interfere in other countries internal policies or put 
limitation on their economic autonomy. The richer nations, first 
stealthily and later openly, started to control economic space 
of other countries after the Uruguay conference. First the 
question of unrestricted exchange of services was brought up. 
Japan and other countries had beaten the United States in 
manufacturing. It felt that it can keep its autonomy on 
international trade only by controlling services. Then 
agriculture was brought up because the European Common Market 
countries had beaten the United States in this area. The idea of 
protecting intellectual property was introduced by the back door 
by saying that the things manufactured by copying should be 
restricted. Later, this was changed to autonomy over 
intellectual property. 
  It does not matter if Pranab Mukherji says that no other 
laws 
except patent laws will be changed. However, India has said many 
times in the Uruguay meeting that it has to change many of its 
laws if it agrees to the proposal. It is important to mention 
here that India received the Dunkel Draft in December 1991. 
However, for 9-10 months, the Indian government could not even 
say what amenities it wanted in this agreement. The report of 
the Permanent Committee clearly indicates that the perfunctionry 
act of getting information by the government was performed under 
pressure from the people.

<F P=106> [News Report: "BJP To Start Anti-Dunkel Campaign"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, 19 December--The BJP has decided to start 
a nationwide movement to protest the government's decision to 
approve the Dunkel draft. The BJP has appealed to the people to 
tell the world that the government had approved this proposal 
against their wishes. The BJP has also decided to introduce a 
resolution over this issue in the Parliament. It has also hinted 
about approaching other parties for cooperation on this issue. 
The Party said that the day the Narasimha Rao government will 
sign agreement over the Dunkel draft will be remembered as a 
black day' in this India's history. The national working 
committee of the BJP also passed a resolution about it on 
Saturday evening after a long meeting. 
  Atal Behari Vajpayee, the Lok Sabha opposition leader, said 
while issuing the resolution that India was expected to lead the 
developing countries in dealing with the dangers of the Dunkel 
draft. However, a weak government knelt down in front of the 
United States and the European union of nations. The BJP 
resolution said that it had repeatedly warned the government 
against the multi-national companies and their agents. He said 
that we had asked for fair trade and not open trade. What did we 
get? An agreement that has seriously hurt the interests of poor 
nations. The third world countries will have to live in the 
shadows of fear of a new kind of colonialism. 
  The BJP said that the Indian government had hurt the 
nation's 
interests by accepting the Dunkel draft. The damage to the 
agricultural area is extreme. Export of garments will also 
suffer badly. The Indian government bowed down both in Trips and 
Trims pacts. The resolution also referred to the commerce 
minister's statement make in the Parliament on 16 December in 
which he had admitted that other countries had started to defy 
the U.S. and European pressure while our government was helpless 
on this issue. The BJP expressed surprise that the commerce 
minister who was expected to protect the interests of the nation 
was not embarrassed when he announced this. 
  The resolution said that the commerce minister was telling 
proudly that India's export will increase by 1.5 to 2 billion 
dollars. The BJP asks if a country's autonomy can be sold or 
bought? The resolution reminds the commerce minister that China 
is not a member of GATT, did not participate in the Dunkel 
talks, and yet still managed to increase its exports by many 
times during the last few years. 
  Mr. Vajpayee said that whatever the government says, the 
truth is that multinational companies like Cargil will continue 
to twist our arms. Some companies have already started to do 
that over our neem trees. The resolution expressed concern that 
the price of grains will be controlled by international trends 
now and that this will adversely effect our economic autonomy. 
We have seen that happen in Africa. As the result of signing the 
Trips pact, drug prices have skyrocketed. The government said 
about Trips that it will decide on where the foreign investments 
will be. How can we expect a government that opens its markets 
to multinational companies to manufacture soda water and potato 
chips to stand boldly? 
  The BJP leader said that his party has been opposing several 
Dunkel issues related to agriculture for the last two years. Now 
it appears that this proposal is detrimental to our national 
interests in other areas also. Mr. Vajpayee said that the 
government has until 10 April of the next year. It should make 
necessary amendments to the Dunkel Draft to help our country and 
other developing countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Om Prakash: "Dunkel Will finish Off the Small </F>
and Marginal Farmers"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 20 December--If we consider our fears to 
be valid, the small and marginal farmers will be totally ruined 
when the Dunkel proposals are implemented. The prices of 
sugarcane, tobacco, and peanuts will fall on the first day. The 
practice of announcement of the approved price at the time of 
sowing will stop. Various types of agriculture will come to an 
end. It is necessary to consider these fears to be true because 
the statements made by the government's department secretary, 
Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji, and by U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore support these fears. 
  Pranab Mukherji said in the Parliament that it is not 
necessary to raise a fuss over the subsidy to the farmers and 
the cheap grains sold in the ration shops. It is important to 
consider how much help the government is able to provide. It 
should be remembered that the issue of subsidies over 
fertilizers, electricity, and water to the farmers is stuck in 
Manmohan Singh's economic policies. The efforts were to reduce 
these subsidies. It is said that the government is not in 
position to give these subsidies. The amount of grains provided 
to the ration shops was reduced by 25 percent last year. It is 
clear that the government is not able to increase the subsidies 
under these two plans. 
  The Dunkel proposals clearly ask for the grains kept for 
domestic use to be accounted for and records of it kept. The 
quantity needed must be declared in advance. Additional 
purchases or storage to this declared amount will not be 
permitted. The government will purchase and sell grains at the 
market rate. There is one exception here. Grains at reduced 
rates with government subsidy can be provided to a specific 
group. However, account of this subsidy must be kept and shared. 
This exception can be made only for feeding for survival. 
  Dr. S.K. Sinha, director of the Indian Agricultural 
Institute, says on the results of this system, "There will be no 
determined price for agricultural production. The open market 
rates will be followed. The government will not be able to levy 
any thing. It will have to purchase and sell at the open market 
rate. Even if the government keeps the present subsidies, the 
grain prices in the ration shops will be higher." The records of 
all these are required to check subsidies given by the 
government if it sees the prices in ration shops increasing. The 
GATT committee will meet to discuss it to discuss this subsidy 
and decide whether it should be approved. Why are all these 
restrictions being imposed on agriculture? Just to make sure 
that the third world countries do not grow more grains than are 
needed. It is being done because when the people began to 
migrate to cities after the World War II, these industrialized 
nations had to provide 200 percent subsidy to farmers in order 
to keep them there. This did save their agriculture, but they 
have had to destroy huge amount of grains in order to control 
the international market rates. They also have to make 
arrangements to sell this, therefore, they have determined that 
three percent of grains consumed must be imported in the first 
year, 3.5 percent during the next five years. This amount will 
increase to five percent in the sixth year. 
  India's future will depend on one exemption. It will not be 
required to import grains if the trade balance is not in its 
favor. India does not have the balance of payment problem now 
because of the money received in loans. We have been importing 
oil to keep the domestic prices low. Therefore, whether we will 
get this exemption or not, only the future will tell. What will 
happen during the next six years? Anwarul Huda, our former 
special commerce secretary and now assistant director of GATT, 
says that our balance of payments is not going to improve in six 
years, therefore, we will be protected from this required 
import. Commerce Secretary Tajender Khanna says, "Not now, but 
it is possible that after six years, we may be forced to 
import." J.C. Pant, special agriculture secretary, says, "the 
difference between three and five percent appears to be very 
small, however, keeping in mind India's population and domestic 
consumption, even this three percent is not a small amount. We 
should oppose it. Let us say, we have to negotiate again in six 
years, our opposition now will help us at that time." 
  Now let us hear what Al Gore said. He said, "At present we 
are trying to save the plants that are becoming rare. First, 
because of environmental pollution. Second, multinational 
companies are giving consistency to such plants for major sale 
in the world market." The patenting of genes and biotechnology 
is being done to benefit these multinational companies. How the 
farmer will have to depend on multinational companies for seeds 
every year is clear from Pranab's comment that there will be a 
law to stop farmers using his seeds a second time. However, the 
question is of the new hybrid seed. How will it work? Our 
Commerce Secretary Tajendar Khanna explains, "The multi-national 
companies can cause havoc here over producing and selling seeds. 
We should have a national policy stopping multi-national 
companies from coming here." We know that they are ignoring the 
issue of farmers and seeds because it is not easy to stop it. If 
the farmers get certain types of seeds in small quantities one 
year and they produce it in large quantities the next year, 
sharing it will not be a barter deal; it would be a sale and 
they must pay royalty on it. Let us look at India's Green 
Revolution for comparison. The seeds that our farmers use were 
procured from genes taken from Japan in 1963 and developed by 
our agricultural scientists. Genes for various rice varieties 
were brought from China. It was made possible because at that 
time the goal was to provide grains to everyone in the world. 
The goal now is to get royalty from every field. 
  There will be no campaigns to determine approved prices now. 
The campaign will be to reduce the prices of sugarcane, tobacco, 
and peanuts as much as is raised. The government says that the 
subsidy for these three crops is less than 10 percent. Those 
outside the government figure this subsidy to be about 30 
percent. The international prices of these three crops are lower 
than in our country. Thus, when all this is put together, it is 
clear that the days of agricultural subsidies are gone.

<F P=106> [Article by Krishna Dutt Paliwal: "Was Gandhi's Swadeshi </F>
Movement a Mistake?"] 
  [Text] One feels very depressed seeing our independence and 
swadeshi campaign at risk. If we look back at the decisions made 
during the last two years, we feel these to be very painful. We 
are beating the drum of progress and development by inviting 
multi-national companies here. India's modern history where the 
East India Company started the loot-oriented trade and made us 
slaves is not yet forgotten. Nor is how the British destroyed 
Indian crafts, arts, trade, and industry, and made this country 
depend on agriculture. Nor how the British loaded away raw 
materials and took over our markets. Now, we are opening our 
markets to the foreigners and are talking about progress. Were 
the decisions we had made during the earlier awakening of Indian 
society, and the swadesh movement on which our freedom campaign 
was depended, illogical, anti-national, and wrong? Can we 
determine a new direction and avoid our experience? The Indian 
campaigns of nineteenth-twentieth century were against 
imperialism, colonialism, neo-feudalism, capitalism, and 
westernization. We never felt worried and threatened at that 
time as we are now. 
  The main goal of our swadeshi campaign and boycott campaign 
was to gain independence. We wanted to be free in thinking, 
working, and in all spheres of life and wanted to reinstall 
those moral values that the British were destroying. The main 
call of awareness of these campaigns was to get rid of mental 
slavery and join the creative and independent currents. However, 
we forgot our promises after the independence during the Nehru 
era. The storms of westernized modernism labeled the Indian life 
style backward. All the blocks that dulled the Indian thought 
such as learning English, westernized education, universities 
organized on foreign models, desire for consumer culture, and 
neglect of Indian philosophy endangered the feeling of being 
Indian. Our independent thinking, which had been blocked for 200 
years, became more helpless after independence. The burden of 
the slaverish dependence on English increased for Hindi and 
other Indian languages. Every area of Indian creativity was 
operated upon, and its nerves were severed. No embarrassment was 
felt when our country was made a mimic of the West. The Nehru 
era continued to show us the dream that if we became 
industrialized like the West and expanded our development 
mechanism, all our caste-related problems would be resolved. Not 
only this, even India's left-wing politicians supported this 
economic model. However, the hollowness of this model was 
evident after 1970. This economic model made a few leaders, 
officials, and industrialists rich overnight, and tied the 
majority of our society in the knot of poverty. 
  It is difficult to estimate what price the Indian people 
have 
had to pay for it. The whole society reeks of stagnation. The 
philosophy of existence emerged in the area of creativity, and 
the Indian face of self-reproachment was formed. The average 
man, who had dreamed about happiness after independence, was 
covered with the thick sheet of disillusion. We learned that the 
assurance of self-respect we had earned during the independence 
movement was disappearing in darkness. The plans for development 
and progress became brutal and our villages were destroyed. 
Blind industrialization and the demonic structure of the 
mechanical age deprived Indian life of its natural atmosphere 
and tied the foreign blindfold on the eyes of Indian cultural 
values. All our cultural and religious symbols were seen to be 
useless and helped only the regressive kind of thought. The 
broad trust we had developed in creativity and thinking, despite 
our poverty, during the independence struggle was strangled by 
the westernized modern beliefs. The extraordinary era of 
creativity and thinking led by Dadabhai Nauroji, Tilak, Bipin 
Chander Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Arvind, Vivekananda, Gandhi, 
Ravinder Nath, Jai Shankar Prasad, Lohia, and Narender Dev is 
neglected now. The whole system got engrossed in the illusion of 
inhuman, barren, and parodoxical pandemonium of modernism. In 
Hindi literature, Bhartendu who had started the new literature 
and started the swadeshi movement, Mahavir Prasad Divavedi, Prem 
Chand, Ram Chander Shukla, Maithilisharan Gupta, Makhan Lal 
Chaturvedi, and Nirala who had followed him could not even 
imagine how the swadeshi movement would be destroyed on such a 
large scale under an organized plan after the independence. Our 
builders worked hard sacrificing their body, soul, and property 
for nationalism and worship to get rid of western slavery. They 
never once thought that their whole work could be ground to dust 
after independence. We remember a line from Jaya Shankar 
Prasad's KAMAYNI over this tragedy, "All the invaluable stars 
were decomposed in the dark gale." The situation is now that 
"this crazy society is running around in the dark." In our 
craziness, we had insulted Gandhi so much that he was ready to 
let a foreign company take over the job of making salt in Gujrat. 
  The crocodiles of international economic organizations and 
multi-national companies have surrounded us to devour India's 
swadeshi movement. Our government, in the name of economic 
liberalization and foreign investments, is conspiring to invite 
those notorious foreign companies that have been causing havoc 
by exploiting poor nations. The mask from the face of a 
government that chants the mantra of progress through 
development plans with foreign loans and economic slavery is 
easily lifted; it cannot be self-dependent and proud. "My great 
India" is not eager to accept the slavery of economic 
imperialism and be their agent, but is mentally preparing 
itself. The conspiracy to expand the open plan of looting by 
inviting the multi-national companies is being hatched. 
  The fact is that under the pressure of U.S. multi-national 
companies, natural seeds from all over the world are being 
researched and developed using biotechnology and "new artificial 
seeds" are being created and forced on all developing countries. 
U.S. companies have developed such seeds and they want markets 
for it. These markets are poor nations such as India where the 
swadeshi movement led by Nauroji, Tilak, and Gandhi has lost its 
direction. The United States imposes the right of intellectual 
property and India bows down. The life of these artificial seeds 
is not more than three or four years and after three or four 
years, they become useless. Thus, the farmers cannot make their 
own seeds. Obviously, these foreign companies want to control 
India's agricultural system, and we are raising the slogan of 
"Great India!" The greatest challenge we have now is to analyze 
this tragedy happening to our country, our language, our pride. 
We should think about Bhartendu's desire for India to understand 
itself and think about what kind of India are we making. Was our 
Indian pride in the struggle for independence a deception? Do 
not we love our nation now? What is the use of prosperity that 
depends on begging? Indian poet Rahim had said that begging 
makes even the greatest person inferior. Even Lord Narayan had 
to become a dwarf in one incarnation because of begging. Our 
repeated contemplation makes us hear one thing: Begging, be it 
by a person or a nation, makes one low and destroys one's 
self-respect. It distorts one's racial and cultural identity. 
This international begging is not appropriate just to make India 
modern. 
  Those who have the responsibility of protecting the esteem 
of 
even the most common person in the country should learn 
something from the proud tradition of India's freedom struggle. 
They should get out of the political chaos for a while and try 
to understand the thoughts of Tilak, Gandhi, and Ravinder Nath. 
They will learn that the 20th century began with the swadeshi 
movement in India. This movement strengthened India's 
independence campaign, and sowed the seeds of patriotism, unity, 
and sacrifice in the people in villages and cities. This 
movement also strengthened socialist movements. It was not just 
a political movement; it was a resolution to free the nation 
from economic and cultural imperialism in the areas of 
literature, art, philosophy, music, science, and industry. This 
movement awakened us with the call to boycott cloth from 
Manchester and salt from Liverpool. This movement also raised 
the slogan to boycott foreign goods. It was this movement for 
which Tilak, Bhagat Singh, and Lala Lajpat Rai sacrificed their 
lives. Gokhale and Arvind Ghosh also took softer steps. The 
women in enslaved India stopped using foreign-made bangles 
because of this movement. Even holy men stopped using foreign 
sugar for worship offerings. This movement spread much political 
awareness and created thousands of patriotic songs resulting in 
the shake- up of British imperialism. This movement helped open 
training centers for domestic industry. 
  Living during that period of wave must have been unique. The 
swadeshi movement had spread with the support of Indian 
festivals, auspicious days, traditions, fairs, folk music, and 
folk drama. The swadeshi movement had spread in every village in 
Bengal through the folk play tours. It was the first time that 
modern political thought had explained to the people the meaning 
of patriotic awakening. The swadeshi movement grew with 
self-dependence and inner strength, and sparkled as national 
pride. Ravinder Nath Tagore, Arvind, Avninder Nath and Nand Lal 
Bose got their inspiration from the swadeshi movement and blew 
the conch shell calling for cultural awakening. They taught the 
lessons of nationalism. independence, and united political 
struggle that revitalized Indian life. Today, we are trying to 
prove that this whole lesson was wrong!

<F P=106> [Article by R.C. Pandit: "Congress (I) is Fighting Over </F>
Dunkel Proposals"] 
  [Text] The Dunkel proposals have enveloped the government 
in such a way that the prime minister and the cabinet members 
are at their wits ends. The Lok Sabha chairman and the Rajya 
Sabha vice chairman have been waiting all week for the 
government to resolve this issue since the Parliament's 
activities could not be stopped indefinitely. Finally, on 
Friday, the opposition dissatisfied even after the statement 
issued by the Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji in the presence 
of the prime minister walked out of the Lok Sabha. In the Rajya 
Sabha, Vice Chairperson Nazma Heptullah very smartly announced 
adjourning the meeting until Monday as soon as the commerce 
minister had finished his speech. The opposition was still 
demanding that Prime Minister Narasimha Rao must clarify the 
whole issue himself. The opposition, however, did not even let 
the proceeding go as far as questions session. 
  Mr. Mukerhji says that the government's decision is 
appropriate because this will help improve the country's economy 
and this is the only way to improve our trade. In the Lok Sabha, 
he opened his mouth only once in the presence of the prime 
minister to say that the unity of the developing countries did 
not last long in the talks over international trade and tariff. 
In the Rajya Sabha, the prime minister stood up only for a 
second to deny an opposition accusation that the government did 
not want to discuss this international agreement in the House. 
Mr. Pranab Mukherji also clarified that government's approving 
the Dunkel proposals does not mean that we have mortgaged the 
autonomy of our country. Mr. Mukherji's clarification raised the 
question as to how 117 countries in the world have agreed to 
this proposal. The question is based on one point on which the 
whole opposition is arguing: How will the farmers benefit from 
it? Mr. Pranab Mukherji responded that it was true the farmer 
could use their own seeds but will not have the right to sell 
them. Similarly, Mr. Mukherji admitted that prices of some drugs 
will increase. However, he said, this will not cause much of a 
problem because controlled rate shops will be opened and special 
agreement made for distribution of fertilizers. The government 
subsidy policy will not be affected by this agreement. 
  The government assured us that if the business of a 
multi-national company proved to be against the nation's 
interests the government could always use its right to close 
that company's business here. Both houses of the Parliament were 
very active from Monday to Friday discussing the GATT and Dunkel 
issues. These discussions have been postponed until Monday after 
the clarifications made by the commerce minister and the prime 
minister on Friday. However, it seems that the Dunkel affair 
will quiet down in the Parliament and out of it. 
  It appears that Lok Sabha Chairperson Shivraj Patil must 
have 
pulled off a miracle, because it was hinted at the beginning of 
the discussion that only Mr. Mukherji would respond to the 
questions, and the prime minister could interrupt him if 
necessary. The commerce minister could not give satisfactory 
answers to questions posed by veteran opposition leaders such as 
Somnath Chaterji, Inderjit Gupta, Nitish Kumar, and George. This 
indicates that the strategy formed by the veteran opposition 
leaders on this issue has been suspended for a while. They will 
cause additional problems for the government, however, by 
raising this issue in a new format since the winter session of 
the Parliament will continue for one more week. 
  The BJP sent a letter to President Shankar Dayal Sharma the 
same day. It accused the government of signing the GATT 
agreement under international pressure and of tying down the 
future generation of the nation in the knots of unfair 
international trade system. In this letter, the BJP also said 
that the arrest of its leaders was motivated by the government's 
malicious and improper attitude.

<F P=106> [Article by Avinash Alok: "GATT: Indian Trade Would Gain, </F>
Except in Patents"] 
  [Text] The two most prominent trading partners of the 
world, European Community and the United States, have reached an 
agreement to liberalise trade. And 113 countries have consented 
to endorse it. 
  The agreement, which is likely to be signed in April 1994 in 
Marakash, Morocco, has been reached in face of stiff opposition 
from some quarters in the developed and the developing world. 
Textile lobbies of the US and Portugal, farming lobbies of 
France and Japan and different quarters of the developing world 
have severely opposed the new arrangement. 
  The mercantilist practice of maximising exports and 
minimising imports is no longer accepted. Trade benefits both 
exporters and importers. Specialisation in production according 
to the resource endowments leads to cost minimisation round the 
world. But in the short run, when the imported cheaper products 
displace domestic goods from the market, some problems crop up 
before the factors of production shift to better alternatives. 
  Thus, lifting of tariff or non-tariff barriers leads to 
problems for the inefficient producers and benefits the 
consumers. The cost-benefit analysis of liberalisation of 
foreign trade underlines that benefits overweigh costs. For the 
developed world, trade liberalisation has become a necessity as 
their domestic markets are becoming saturated. 
  On the other hand, for the developing world this analysis 
needs to be done more carefully. Their gains from trade are 
less, because of low value-added primary exports and higher 
percentage of export earnings in GDP. This latter fact means 
that the developing world's vulnerability to external factors is 
high. And there is an immediate loss of revenue, because of 
decrease in customs duty. But in the long run the gains from 
trade are likely to overweigh costs. 
  The opening of primary products market, which has so far 
been 
guarded by high tariff and subsidy walls, is expected to help 
the developing countries. The specialisation in the production 
of goods in their respective areas of advantage will help them 
capture the markets of the developed world. The other point to 
reckon with is that the developing world's bargaining power 
becomes very low in bilateral negotiations. 
  A number of issues, which were controversial, have been left 
out. Issues like entertainment, financial services, shipping and 
communication fall in that category. The US reluctantly agreed 
to phase out import quotas on Third World textiles and clothing 
in over 10 years rather than 15 years. 
  India is going to gain by this agreement in all spheres 
except the patents. In textiles, although 49 per cent of the 
quota is to be lifted only after the year 2005 AD, the Indian 
industry, which ranks amongst the best in the world, is going to 
get a big boost during the phased withdrawal of 51 per cent of 
the quota by the end of the period. 
  Indian exports of steel ropes, wires and rods have been the 
target of US anti-dumping authorities in the past. The new rule 
under the agreement is that the volume of dumped imports is to 
be treated as negligible, if from a particular country it works 
out to be less than one per cent of the market for similar 
products in the importing country. This stipulation is going to 
help Indian exports in a number of spheres, besides the 
specified ones, because of very low labour cost and subsequent 
lower costs of production by international standards. 
  Though Indian economy has not been able to generate enough 
surplus of foodgrains, farm and related products, poultry and 
dairy-based ones, will find a good market in the developed 
world. This section of exports (poultry and dairy) has a very 
high value-added content and a very good market in the developed 
countries. Although India produces very little of the Japonica 
variety of rice, the demand for which will rise with the opening 
of the Japanese and Korean rice markets, pressure on the 
Japonica variety will make the Indian variety more attractive. 
  India is a part of the developing world. It falls in the 
low-income bracket, but the size of its economy sets it apart 
from the other developing countries. Indian export earning in 
terms of the GDP is as low as 8.12 per cent. Manufactured goods 
constitute about two-thirds of the exports. 
  The factors which affect the developing world are not of 
concern to India and if its economy moulds itself according to 
the requirements of the developed world markets then the new 
agreement will help it tremendously.

<F P=106> [Article by R.C.B.: "Fraud on the Nation"] </F>
  [Text] Former Karnataka Chief Minister S. Bangarappa has 
accused the Prime Minister of lacking in scruples. If the PM 
lacks in scruples, and a congressman should know, the Government 
headed by him cannot have any. So when Pranab Mukherjee, 
Commerce Minister, says that because of the latest GATT accord 
climaxing the 7-year Uruguay Round our exports will increase by 
US$1.5 billion to 2 billion annually, one has to take the 
statement with a pinch of salt. Similarly when he says that 
India would benefit more from the expansion of world trade 
through the Uruguay Round agreement than by pursuing "any 
alternative course of action," the minister is only trying to 
hide beneath general terms the fraud the Government has played 
on the nation. 
  The government had assured the political parties that it 
would discuss the matter with them before taking a decision on 
the Government's position on the Dunkel Proposals. The 
Government had also promised to have a thorough discussion on 
the subject in Parliament. The Government has failed to keep its 
promise; instead it has quietly shown the green signal to a new 
trade regime imposed by USA, World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund. 
  Of course a formal signing and ratification of the Agreement 
will take some time. But that is just a formality. The fact is 
that the Government has caved in before the imperialist pressure 
and has virtually mortgaged its economic initiative in trade and 
trade-related fields, farming and medicines, patents and 
processes. 
  On its own admission, the Government was not in favour of 
inclusion of Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights in the 
scope of the Uruguay Round. However, it had to go along with the 
rest of the world community. To say the truth this so-called 
`world community' is represented by USA, the WB, IMF and a few 
western countries supporting USA. The latter has successfully 
sorted out its trading interests with them and they together 
have pushed the developing countries into the GATT fire. 
  Again the Government has conceded that they were unhappy 
with 
the extension of the textile quota regime by importing countries 
for another 10 years and unsatisfactory annual rate of 
enhancement of the import quotas; yet it has claimed that the 
commitment to finally phase out the quota regime after 10 years 
"is a positive gain" for textile exporting countries! 
  Shri Rao talked of `concessions' gained by the sustained 
efforts made by India and a few other countries without which 
the contents of the GATT agreement would have been much worse. 
The PM thus indirectly conceded that the GATT agreement is not 
all that good. But what the PM did not say is that the 
`concessions' will have only a cosmetic effect; there is no 
basic change in the Dunkel Proposals which have been accepted 
finally. 
  On the question of farm products the Government's beetle 
refrain has been that the upper limit of subsidies prescribed is 
far higher than the level of subsidies in India. The Dunkel 
Proposals on agriculture are not confined to subsidies. They 
extend to many other aspects of farm products, including 
compulsory imports. The farmers are up in arms against the 
proposals on account of the effect they will have on the total 
farming scene. 
  But even if one believes what Shri Rao and Shri Mukherjee 
contend, the quiet manner in which the Government has agreed to 
the Uruguay Round without getting the approval of Parliament on 
a matter so vital to our economic system indicates that the 
Government's credentials in this regard are not impeccable.

  [Text] The inevitable has happened. And as President 
Clinton succinctly remarked: America has succeeded in opening up 
the world market for its products. At least, the American 
President is being honest. 
  True, as GATT Chief Peter Sutherland said, "I am convinced 
that today will be seen as a defining moment in modern economic 
and political history which would mean more trade, more 
investment, more jobs and larger income growth for all." 
Economists believe all this trade liberalisation holds out the 
promise of expanding global output by $6 trillion over the next 
decade, $1 trillion of that in the United States. 
  It certainly is a defining moment in modern economic and 
political history. It is not difficult to see why. In developing 
countries, food security has become a central element of food 
and agricultural policy. But in none of these 132 countries 
agriculture is a commercial activity. Traditional agriculture, 
in which small and medium-sized farms still predominate would be 
washed away as if by a catastrophic flood. Consequently, large 
populations would be uprooted and swept into urban slums. 
Nowhere will this be more clearly evident than in an over 
populous country like India. 
  Despite the advances made in food production, it is 
estimated 
that over 200 million people living in poverty in India now 
suffer from chronic hunger. Whether an increase in export 
products would improve the pathetic living standards of poorer 
sections of the population is a question that has been 
conveniently avoided. The Commerce Ministry has taken pains to 
explain that India's trade is expected to go up by nearly $2 
million per annum due to the general expansion of the world 
trade. Some of the gains will certainly "trickle down" to the 
poor. 
  While the "trickle down" theory no longer holds any 
credibility, what has not been explained, and for obvious 
reasons, is what will happen to the remarkable famine-avoidance 
strategy that has been developed over the years. In the event of 
cheap food being dumped into India, the very first casualty will 
be the food security system. The GATT agenda, which when 
embodied into an international agreement, will subvert India's 
laws that protect national interests and promotes self-reliance. 
  A little known fact is that the Draft Final Text of the GATT 
contains a proposal to establish a new international 
institution--the Multilateral Trade Organisation--which will 
have powers to require national parliaments to alter legislation 
that is `GATT inconsistent'. Future laws must also pass this 
litmus test, thus requiring parliaments to seek approval of GATT 
headquarters before initiating legislations. And it is here that 
the people of India can exercise their franchise. They have done 
so in the past and will certainly not fail the nation again. 
  Ever since the Paddock brothers predicted in the '60s that 
at 
least half of India would be led to a slaughter house by the 
end of the '70s, India has successfully managed to prove the 
"prophets of doom" wrong. Take a look at history and you find 
that it was replete with drought, famine and hunger. Between 
1770 and 1880, as many as 27 famines and food scarcities were 
recorded. More than 20 million people had perished from hunger 
and malnutrition--in the 20 famines that struck India between 
1850 and 1943. 
  It is not as if the weather gods have been particularly 
benevolent after the colonial masters left the country's shores. 
Perhaps the widespread drought that struck the northern and 
central parts of the country in mid-80s was the severest in the 
20th century. And yet the country was able to tide over the 
crisis without seeking any foreign aid. For a nation, which only 
a few years ago was written off by Paddock brothers, this was no 
mean achievement. 
  Didn't Peter Sutherland say that the consensus on Uruguay 
Round is a defining moment in modern economic and political 
history. 
<H5>  Battleground </H5>
  Trade in food has been a battleground for competing 
interests. It never distinguished between protection of 
corporate and northern interests and protection of long-term 
interests. This is nothing new. Nor are the powerful nations of 
the North likely to desist from the pursuit of their interests. 
Governments of the developing countries have rarely risen to 
thwart the covert designs of the rich nations. They have failed 
us in the past and have betrayed us once again. 
  Only popular pressure has a hope of putting world trade 
discussions onto a different track, where global sustainability 
takes priority. GATT poses vital challenges to all who are 
dedicated to improving food quality and security, to defining 
the environment and to promoting public health and fair trade. 
  The additional 40 million hungry in India an aftermath of 
GATT trade liberalisation, is not merely a statistical data. It 
involves people who have no other means of existence. Unlike in 
the West, the poor in India will not be paid for keeping their 
marginal lands fallow. In the United Kingdom, for instance, some 
farmers are getting as much as pound 100,000 a year for not 
cultivating their lands. Over pound one billion is being paid to 
farmers in the European Community for what is popularly called 
as "Set-Aside." As if this is not enough exports estimate that 
the amount of "Set-Aside" in the UK could almost double under 
the GATT agreement. 
  The hope for survival rests with the people.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dunkel: Another Viewpoint"] </F>
  [Text] The opinion given out by some experts endorsing the 
Government's decision to accept the Dunkel proposals would 
certainly help calm the consternation caused in Parliament and 
in other circles describing the move as a sell-out that would 
seriously compromise India's sovereignty and independence. The 
bottomline by these experts too is that India could ill-afford 
to opt out to the multilateral trading system at a time when the 
rest of the world was acceding to such a global economic regime. 
That even a country like Japan with all its economic clout has 
thought it prudent to take the politically unsavoury decision of 
opening up its rice market speaks for itself. With the 
developing countries hardly in a position to present a common 
front against a global trade regime seen as favourable to the 
developed world, as also lacking the kind of economic muscle 
needed to negotiate from a position of strength at the Uruguay 
Round, India could have hardly been expected to swim against the 
tide. But even when India has no choice but to sign such a move, 
according to these experts, the Generalised Agreement on Trade 
and Tariffs would not necessarily be detrimental to India's 
interests. Thus former Union Food Minister C. Subramaniam has 
allayed fears expressed earlier that interests of the Indian 
farmers would be adversely affected by the probable increase in 
prices of inputs like seeds. Instead, he believes that the vast 
increase in productivity would more than compensate for any such 
losses. Similarly, he dismisses apprehensions expressed by 
Indian academics about being ill-prepared for competition with 
MNCs in research in genetics, and genetic engineering as being 
unfounded. His experience--and he should know, being the father 
of Green revolution in the country--has shown instead that 
Indian scientists are in no way inferior to those in the West. 
But while defending the government's decision to accept the 
Dunkel proposals and emphasising its benefits, these experts 
have not shied away from pinpointing its costs. Thus Dr Malcolm 
Adiseshiah has singled out issues relating to seeds patenting 
and the use of bio-resources of the Third World by the MNCs and 
their being brought back for sale to Third World as patented 
high-priced commodities as being some of the "very negative" 
features of the Dunkel Draft. Indeed in the light of what these 
experts have said, the government should educate the public 
about the hard realities of accepting the new global trade 
regime. Simply glossing over these unpleasant facts can hardly 
help the government to allay suspicions that it has become a 
party to the conspiracy hatched by the developed world to 
establish its hegemony over India.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Sethuraman: "`Super 301' To Stay Despite GATT </F>
Accord"] 
  [Text] The Clinton Administration, which subordinates the 
economic interests of other nations to its own, is confident 
that the Uruguay Round Final Accord in no way limits its ability 
to use its legislative "trade arsenal," especially Section 301 
and its own anti-dumping and counterveiling duty laws. 
  US undoubtedly stands to gain the most from the Final Accord 
for its agriculture, businesses, services other than financial, 
and the economy in general. It has enumerated the benefits for 
agriculture (with the phasing-in of global farm supports by way 
of reductions in tariffs for market access, export subsidies and 
internal supports) as well as gains for US pharmaceuticals, 
construction equipment and the electronics sector. 
  Yet, a US administration `Fact Sheet' claims that 
cross-retaliation, between sectors, would be possible if a 
settlement procedure in the Accord would also not weaken US 
trade laws or change the way it uses Section 301. "Our 
negotiators made sure of that," it contends. 
  In textiles and clothing, where the developing countries had 
merely to be satisfied with the phase integration of the 
restrictive quota-based multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) over a 
10-year period, with significant liberalisation back-loaded, US 
has given notice that exporting countries would not receive 
increased quota growth (in the intervening period) unless and 
until they submit schedules which would open their markets and 
bind their tariffs. 
  Although this approach is strongly opposed by several 
textile-exporting countries--and India stood its position till 
the end--US and the European Union propose to seek an amendment 
to the textile and clothing text to "directly link the phase-out 
of MFA with opening of markets by exporting countries." 
  While maintaining that several of its key objectives in the 
Uruguay Round have been met in areas like anti-dumping, 
procurement (to facilitate US bidding for goods and services 
contracts), and intellectual property besides agriculture, the 
Clinton Administration expects greater use of Section 301 in 
areas not covered but where countries "do not meet their Uruguay 
Round commitments." 
  Some American economists and trade analysts question the 
assumptions of the Administration in regard to the use of 
bilateral weapons after the Final Act of the Uruguay Round comes 
into effect from January 1, 1995 as scheduled at present. 
  In any case, trade tensions, already at a peak with 
countries 
like Japan and China, are not likely to lower in the near 
future, US is also likely to step up its anti-dumping actions. 
The Commerce Department has ruled that companies in India and 
Taiwan are dumping forged stainless steel flanges on the US 
market. 
  Earlier, US had imposed anti-dumping duty on imports of 
steel 
pipes and tubes and sulfanilic acid imports from India. Trade 
Commission has made a final determination of dumping involving 
levy of 48.8 per cent duty affecting over seven million dollars 
of imports from India. At the same time, US is pushing for more 
"tied aid" loans by the Export-Import Bank for subsidising US 
exports to Asian countries. 
  A major disappointment for US in the just-concluded Uruguay 
Round was the failure to include financial services, like 
banking and insurance, along with audiovisual and maritime 
services, in the Accord. Given its stake in the 900 billion 
dollar services market, the US Administration has decided to try 
bilateral negotiations over the next two years, and if 
unsuccessful by January 1, 1996, it would block firms of 
countries like Japan, Korea and many developing countries from 
expanding their services in US. 
  The hope is that though MFN exemptions would be obtained for 
banking and other financial services, including insurance, for 
an initial period, it would be able to pressure other countries 
to open financial markets and put in place a solid set of 
commitments in this vital area of interest to American services.

  [Text] By acquiscing to accept the Dunkel Treaty, the 
Narasimha Rao government has finally decided to sign the deed of 
mortgage of the nation's economy, independence and honour. It is 
not to say that any other government would have done better or 
anything different given the political illiteracy of most of the 
political parties about the fundamentals of India and its 
economy and its serious incompatibility with the Western 
assumptions. Added to this is the unfortunate drift in the 
debate in India on the Dunkel formulation. 
  The real issue is not whether the Dunkel Treaty is good or 
bad for India--there is no doubt that it is bad. It is not just 
an issue of India vs the rest or producers vs consumers, as some 
would like us to believe. It is far deeper and fundamental. It 
raises a far reaching question: whether all that is Western is 
to be accepted as the modern, and whether the Western view of 
life should have universal application and therefore acceptance. 
The Dunkel Regime is the continuation of the Western assumptions 
about the superiority of its thoughts, view of life-systems and 
institutions. It aims at homogenisation of the world based on 
Western experience. The experience of 10 per cent is being 
experimented on the rest by Dunkel. The Indian debate so far on 
Dunkel has missed precisely this point. It is the failure of 
intellectuals and intellectualism in India. 
  On the practical side, the Dunkel Regime seeks to instal a 
world government in trade, technology and services with its 
attendant bureaucracy and bureaucratisation. A world government 
in trade without a world currency, but dependent on the 
currencies of Group 7 nations, will be at the speculators' 
mercy. The Dunkel Regime is guaranteed to fail as any global 
level hegemony is bound to whether powered by a single nation, 
or a cartel of them or a multilateral system. The Indian 
government and the political parties have failed to explore the 
possibility of bilateral arrangements as an alternative for the 
multilateral Dunkel Regime where, given the players and 
deciders, India was genuinely a nobody and was rightly treated 
as such. So because of incompetence, the Indian political system 
has imposed the Dunkel Regime on India. 
  The Dunkel Regime castrates the government of India but 
cannot bind the people of India. The Dunkel Regime can be turned 
into a blessing in disguise. The people of India can be awakened 
to realise a real alternative lifestyle which is their true 
inheritance. For instance, Yoga, Ayurveda and Herbs can 
substantially dislodge antibiotics; [word missing] can keep away 
stress, heart breaks and psychiatrists. By social initiative we 
can revive our independent mind which will blend the modern with 
the traditional and discriminate between what we need from what 
the West offers. The nation needs to revive this swadeshi 
approach which will be symbolically a resistance against 
Colgates, Cokes and Pepsies and substantially a re-instatement 
of a native alternative as the substance and the Western as the 
additive, instead of the Western as the substance and the 
native an additive.

<F P=106> [Article by D.B. Thengadi: "Liberalization Under GATT and </F>
U.S. Is a Downright Fraud"] 
  [Text] In spite of all the propaganda in favour of `free 
trade' concept Ruigrok informs us that the pattern of global 
trade looks as follows: 
  --approximately 25 percent takes place inside global 
companies--(intra-company trade), 
  --approximately 25 percent is bilateral trade (by 
preferential agreements), 
  --approximately 25 percent is barter trade, 
  --approximately 25 percent can be considered `free trade' 
governed by GATT rules. 
  The author has quoted this from FAST (Forecasting and 
Assessment in Science and Technology). 
  While advocating the principle of free trade, the US has 
been 
following the policy of protectionism regarding textiles right 
from 1956 when the President was given the authority under the 
Agricultural Act to negotiate agreements for limiting "imports 
into the United States of Textiles or Textile products." In the 
1980s, the US administration employed non-tariff barriers to 
insulate the US automobile industry from the competitive threat 
that, as in the case of the textile industry, was posed by 
Japanese imports. (As James Dunn points out, post-war 
international trade in automobiles has always been a mixture of 
liberalising and protecting elements.) 
  Japan is, in many cases, a one-way trader, not importing any 
of the product categories it exports. The same is the case with 
the Japanese foreign investment imbalance. As at 31st March, 
1990, Japanese direct investments abroad amounted to seventeen 
times the value of FDI in Japan. Japanese competitiveness and 
huge trade and investment imbalances have contributed, according 
to experts, to the EC and US conflicts with Japan in industrial 
products. `Toyotism' of Japanese industry has given it a great 
advantage over `Fordism' of the US and EC industries. To cite a 
single example. In the 60s and 70s, the EC's ship-building 
industry could not stand a threat from Japanese ship-building 
companies' aggressive marketing strategies. 
  With the present growth of Japan's foreign direct 
investments 
in the EC and the US, the industries of the latter are demanding 
more trade barriers and greater protection (Though recently 
Japanese economy also is showing signs of decay). 
  It is interesting to note that criticism of free trade 
doctrine has been gaining ground as the EC and the US have been 
meeting with increasingly fierce competition in a number of 
industries. Many of the earlier champions of the doctine are 
today its critics. 
  This opportunism is not a new phenomenon. When German goods 
were dominating British markets, Britain was the worst critic of 
free trade principle. After industrial revolution, the equation 
changed and Britain became the best champion of free trade 
doctrine. 
  The current American concept of "fairness in trade" reminds 
Biswajit Dhar of Gladstone's remark made more than a century ago 
under similar situation: "It (fairness in trade) bears 
suspicious likeness to our old friend protection." 
  The decline in the economic strength of the United States 
started in the 1960s. The process of the end of its hegemony 
commenced around 1973. By the 1980s the United States had come 
to be established as the economic power going rapidly down hill. 
Several authors like Linder and others have predicted the end of 
the US hegemony in the international economy during the early 
period of the next century. With every new set-back, the US has 
been deviating progressively from the principle of free trade, 
and by this time it has completely abandoned that once-sacred 
doctrine. These recent developments and deviations in the US 
trade strategy have been aptly elaborated by Biswajit Dhar in 
his The Decline of Free Trade and US Trade Policy 
Today. 
  At the level of policy, the demise of `non-interventionist' 
mode can be seen clearly in the case of US where trade 
administration has adopted an "activist" trade policy, 
particularly during the last two decades. While the increased 
doses of protectionism formed the core of the nature of State 
intervention in the earlier years--seeking increased 
market--access for US products by compelling its partner 
countries to change their policies and become "more open." It, 
i.e., protectionism has now become the sole thrust of the 
policy--initiative in recent years. Trade legislation in US 
since 1974 indicates this trend. The Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988, particularly through its two new 
provisions, namely, Super 301 and Special 301, unfolds fully the 
intentions of the policy makers. 
  The protectionist measures adopted by the US have abrogated 
the basic principles of non-intervention in trade, underlying 
the post-war trading system governed by the GATT rules. Specific 
and systematic trade barriers have been raised by the US, in 
violation of the GATT rules. This has grossly undermined the 
multi-lateral trading system. In response to the competitive 
threats from Japan and other newly exporting countries, the US 
curbed imports by using increasing doses of protectionism 
achieved through imposition of the non-tariff barriers, and 
increased exports by forcing open foreign markets using the 
powers of trade retaliation that were assumed by the US 
President through the Trade Acts of 1974 and 1988. The first 
phase gave protection to domestic producers against imports. 
Quota restrictions on exports to the US were imposed. The US 
trade administration frequently imposed Voluntary Export 
Restraints (VERs) and Orderly Marketing Arrangements (OMAs) on 
several countries. 
  The more prominent industries that were provided 
import-protection were steels, automobiles, textiles, machine 
tools and semi-conductors. Section 301 of the 1974 Act was 
directed at the policies of foreign governments which did not 
provide free access to US products in their markets. In 1985, 
the insurance industry in Korea was targeted for this purpose, 
the action under section 301 of the 1974 Act was initiated. 
Between 1985 and 1988, when the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act was passed, Section 301 was used 26 times. 
  In the 1988 Act, two changes were made in Section 301. Super 
301 was introduced to deal with general and systematic trade 
barriers imposed by different countries, while Special 301 was 
introduced to deal with cases relating to insufficient 
protection of intellectual property rights of US origin. 
  Under Super 301, action could be initiated against the 
entire 
gamut of trade and trade related policies that the infringing 
partners were following in retaliation against a sector or an 
industry-specific infringement. In other words, Super 301 
provided for cross retaliation between sectors. 
  Secondly, Super 301 introduced a time-frame for identifiable 
specific cases of trade distortions, and initiating cases 
against countries which, according to US, were obstructing US 
exports. The cases under Super 301 were to be initiated in 1989 
and 1990, and the retaliatory action against the "identified" 
infringing countries were to be carried out within 180 days of 
establishing that trade distortions were liable for retaliation. 
  Special 301 covers infringement of intellectual property 
rights of US origin causing distortions in US exports. Special 
301 was to ensure that US exports could be increased by 
compelling countries to provide a stronger monopoly to US 
commercial interests in their markets through an appropriate 
system of intellectual property protection that the US trade 
administration deemed fit. 
  Unlike provisions under section 337, the Special 301 
provision did not put the onus on the complainant to "Prove" the 
injury. The US International Trade Commission was simply 
required to institute inquiry into the complaint and grant 
protection, all within 90 days of the registering of the 
complaint. 
  In May, 1989, the USTR identified three countries: India, 
Japan and Brazil and put them on the list of priority countries 
for action under Super 301; and six trade-distorting 
practices--the `priority practices'--of these countries were 
identified, India was found to restrict US exports from entering 
its markets through two "priority practices." 
  (a) Foreign investors in the country were required to export 
a part of the produce, and to use locally produced inputs, 
thereby causing trade distortions, and 
  (b) US service industries were prevented from competing in 
the Indian market. India's market was completely closed to 
foreign insurance companies. 
  A new list of `priority practices' under Super 301 was 
issued 
in April, 1990. The list had two cases and both involved India. 
The two priority practices of India listed in 1989 were again 
included in the 1990 list. Japan and Brazil were excluded. Trade 
barriers to insurance and investment in India were particularly 
irritating. 
  In 1989 and 1990, four countries--India, China, Thailand and 
Brazil, were put on the priority watch list. In April 1991, USTR 
decided to initiate proceedings under the Special 301 clause. 
India, China and Thailand were named as priority countries for 
action under Special 301. 
  The US is insisting upon free trade and the so-called 
`liberalisation'. The US experts have excelled Dr Goebels in the 
propaganda techniques. "Repeat a lie hundred times, and it 
becomes the truth," Dr Goebels said. Hitler went a step further. 
He said that if a lie is to be circulated, you should not give a 
simple lie, give a big bluff--so big that people will not be 
able, because of the magnitude of the given lie, to suspect that 
such a big news may be a lie. Because of the American propaganda 
the doctrine of economic liberalisation became popular in the 
last two decades. De-regulation and privatisation have acquired 
respectability and authenticity. The IMF and the World Bank 
have been striving to sell `liberatisation' doctrine to the 
third world countries by imposing on the debtor countries. 
Policy of economic liberalisation as a condition of further 
credit. The GATT and the US are preaching the free trade 
principle as a sacred gospel truth. But the US is itself 
violating this "sacred" principle. The US is also violating the 
standards evolved by the International Organisation for 
Standardisation. The US public procurement policies are not in 
confirmity with the GATT Government Procurement code. 
`Buy-American' restrictions cover vast area. There were 
thirty-one significant cases of special protection which covered 
four broad sectors--manufacturing, mining, agriculture and 
fisheries. Some other services also are being given protection. 
It is subsidising heavily its farm sector, while demanding that 
other countries should withdraw all subsidies to that sector. It 
is following double-standards in case of pharmaceutical sector 
also. 
  These are clearly the unprincipled bullying tactics. The 
culprits in this crime are the rulers and the big capitalists of 
the US--not its common masses who are themselves kept in the 
dark about developments on economic front. These bullying 
tactics are being employed not only against the southern, 
developing countries, but also against European community and 
North American peoples. The recent militant reaction of French 
farmers and the strong support given to their gesture by farmers 
of other European countries; the agitation of the working people 
of US against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); 
the effective protest registered by Canadian voters against the 
ruling party that became a signatory to the notorious NAFTA; the 
demonstration (on October 2) by 12 purely American organisations 
of environmentalists and humanitarians against the modus 
operandi of Cargill--all these indicate that the unholy alliance 
between the rulers and the big capitalists of US is operating 
not only against the third world countries, but also against 
other developed white countries, and even against the less 
privileged masses of US itself. 
  And these culprits are the champions of free trade, 
liberalisation and globalisation--a case of Satan Quoting the 
Bible. 
  To sum up: 
  In its present form-- 
  `Liberalisation' of the GATT and the US is a down-right 
fraud. 
  `Liberalisation' of Dr Manmohan Singh is sheer gullibility. 
  `Liberalisation' of our air-conditioned radicals is 
ignorance 
or hypocricy. 
  `Liberalisation' is a grave challenge to patriots of all 
non-American countries. 
  Hence the propriety and urgency of `Swadeshi' for all 
non-American peoples of the world. 
  Genuine liberalisation and hegemonic globalisation can never 
go together. The Hindu concept of globalisation represents 
genuine globalisation. 
  The Hindu version of globalisation is fairly well known to 
all Hindus who are not self-alienated: For them the elaboration 
of Hindu concept may be a superfluous repetition of whatever 
they know already. For the benefit of the de-Hindised Hindus a 
brief restatement of the same may, however, be helpful here. 
  Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who could conceive of the 
Central 
State Authority without stateism, envisaged evolution of the 
world state enriched by the growth and contribution of 
different national cultures, as well as the flowering of the 
Manava Dharma, enriched by the perfection of all the religions 
including `materialism'. 
  Revered Sri Guruji believed that the world unity and human 
welfare can be made real only to the extent mankind realises the 
ultimate, absolute Vedantic truth that "all is one." What he 
implied was not elimination of all distinctive features of 
nations and rolling them all into one uniform pattern. He 
visualised various groups of peoples coming together in a spirit 
of familism realising the innate oneness of mankind while 
preserving their individual identities and special 
characteristics. The different human groups are marching 
forward, all towards the same goal, each in its own way and in 
keeping with its own characteristic genius. The destruction of 
the special characteristics, whether of an individual or of a 
group, will destroy not only the natural beauty of harmony but 
also its joy of self-expression. To seek harmony among the 
various and diverse characteristics has been our special 
contribution to the world thought. "The World State of our 
concept," says Sri Guruji, "will evolve out of a federation of 
autonomous and self-contained nations under a common centre 
linking them all...it is the grand world-unifying thought of 
Hindus alone that can supply the abiding basis for human 
brotherhood, that knowledge of the inner spirit which will 
charge the human mind with the sublime urge to toil for the 
happiness of mankind, while opening out full and free scope for 
every small life-speciality on the face of the earth to grow to 
its full stature. Verily, this is the one real practical 
world-mission, if ever there was one," he remarked. 
  This Hindu concept has been elucidated elaborately by Rishi 
Aurobindo who envisaged the still further stage of `mass 
spiritualism'. With this mental background, our 
rishis conceived of the `Old World State'. 
  "From sea to sea, over all the land, one State." 
  This is genuine globalisation. In its absence, the world 
cannot go beyond the abortive experiments of the League of 
Nations or the UNO. 
  Without the growth of such Hindu, i.e., human consciousness, 
it is impossible in the international economic field to ensure 
genuine `free trade', maximum utilisation of the scarce 
resources, development without environmental problems and 
permanent damage to Nature; adjustment of the presently 
unlimited human desires with the limited resources of the 
planet; management of population explosion; diversion of all the 
huge amounts allocated currently by different countries for 
their defence budgets to their developmental activities; 
encouragement to every country to maximise its specialised 
production; free exchange of scientific and technological 
information; constitution of International Technological 
Ombudsman; curbing the activities of international criminal 
gangs disturbing seriously the economic structures of even the 
civilised countries; and world peace, harmony and prosperity.

  [Text] By accepting the Dunkel proposals, India has 
finished off its economic respectability. Now India does not 
consider it an insult to have an East India company come in and 
call the shots. Now East India companies are surrounding us on 
all sides. We have taken the position that even if we do not 
accept the proposals, foreign powers will attack us on the 
economic front. In the eyes of the world, this would be 
appropriate. Provisions were made in the Dunkel draft for this 
contingency. We expressed our consent. Parliamentary 
investigatory committee's Bhagwan Shankar Ravat has made this 
claim. He is worried that the government is viewing their stance 
as neutral, while in fact, the results will not bear this out. 
The budget will suffer and our economic losses will be great. 
Just when we were making strides in deficit reduction. Shri 
Ravat is also worried about that Indian industry will not get a 
boost under the Dunkel proposals. Of course, industry has thus 
far been under the protection of the government. After the 
implementation of the Dunkel proposals, Indian industry will be 
under the thumb of foreign governments and the multinational 
companies. India is sooner or later certain to find itself in 
this situation. Protection of foodstuffs will end. Farmers all 
over the country will be laboring for the multinationals. Small 
and marginal farmers will be reduced to penary. Ayurvedic 
medicine, along with the whole range of medicines, will no 
longer be affordable to the comman man. Indian brains will think 
for foreigners. Indian scientists and researchers will be in a 
similar position. Shri Ravat thinks the proposals will have an 
adverse affect on national unity as well. Center-State relations 
will be pushed off a precipice. Tensions will skyrocket. 
  Shri Ravat regards acceptance of the Dunkel proposals as 
unconstitutional. The Indian government does not have the right 
to barter away economic sovereignty. Secondly, the Indian system 
of punishment will be dealt a severe blow. Now, the accused 
stands innocent until proven guilty. Guilt has to be proven. The 
Dunkel proposals assume guilt, requiring innocence to be proven. 
  Shri Ravat says that developed nations are not really 
signing 
on to Dunkel out of free choice, but under the paternalism of 
the U.S. U.S. imperialism is on the rise and requires the 
economic surrender of every nation. Balkrishnan Jutshi, India's 
representative at the treaty talks, has falsely said that the 
proposals do not threaten the nation. He claims we are a 
developed country and have the same interests as Western 
countries. 
  Shri Ravat says the government has not taken into 
consideration what effect the proposals will have on the 
country. They have not researched the issues involved or 
considered the details in the proposals. The government, 
instead, has already made the decision to sign before sitting 
down at the table. Shri Ravat says that the government is 
deceiving people regarding the imminent shortage of seeds, 
agricultural incentives, ration shopsa and medicines. Assurances 
on the part of the government are a mere smokescreen. The truth 
is that the policy is one of reverting to economic slavery. The 
engine of international economics is run by multinational 
companies. They have long ago signed on to the Dunkel proposals. 
They get 15 percent equity forgiven. 
  Why did India find itself all alone on the international 
stage? Shri Ravat feels that India lost its role as leader of 
the third world which Nehru had established. Developing 
countries, for their own reasons, followed separate patterns of 
development. Each system has different problems. India's lack of 
leadership over this time has pigeon-holed us. Foreign policy is 
done on a wing and a prayer. Swadeshi products, self-reliance 
and self-respect were abandoned by the present government. They 
give liitle importance to gaining the respect and trust of other 
countries. They know they don't deserve it.

<F P=106> [Commentary by journalist A.K. Bhattacharya] </F>
  [Text] Those who criticize the central government for 
agreeing to the Dunkel proposals at the Uruguay round of 
negotiations should now be reassured by the announcement made by 
the agriculture minister, Dr. Balram Jakhar. He has said that 
the government would introduce specific legislation to safeguard 
the interests of domestic farmers. He also said at the Fifth 
World Sugar Farmers Conference in New Delhi yesterday that India 
would not allow patenting of seeds. This means that India would 
evolve its own system of preserving plant varieties. The fact 
however is that the Dunkel draft has not prescribed any 
patenting regime for seeds. It is only a figment of imagination 
of some people that the Dunkel draft will impose restrictions on 
the use of seeds by Indian farmers. It is being argued by some 
leaders belonging to the opposition political parties that 
farmers now have to purchase fresh seeds every time they want to 
sow them. In other words, they cannot use seeds generated from 
existing crops. These leaders have aroused the passions of 
Indian farmers so strongly that recently a rally of agitating 
farmers ransacked the office of a U.S. multinational seeds 
company. 
  The agriculture minister has now put an end to such a 
debate. 
By ruling out patenting of seeds he has dispelled the root 
cause of the farmers' apprehension. And since India would now 
have to evolve its own system of preserving plant varieties, 
there should be no question of ignoring the interests of Indian 
farmers. While evolving the new system, Indian farmers and 
other representative bodies should be consulted. This will be 
necessary to ensure that all apprehensions of the farmers and 
the opposition leaders on the issue are addressed adequately. 
  This brings one to the time of applicability of the Dunkel 
draft. First, it will take at least one more year for the draft 
to be ratified by parliaments of all member countries of GATT 
before it becomes operational. Secondly, it is left entirely to 
national governments like India to take its own time in 
formulating the new system of protecting plant varieties. This 
will have to be in broad conformity with the international 
protocol on this issue. But the key issue which cannot be lost 
sight of is that the nitty-gritty of such a system will be 
finalized at home and not on foreign soil as has been alleged by 
some critics of the Dunkel draft. More importantly, the Indian 
Government and Indian farmers will have a lot of time at their 
disposal to discuss and debate the new legislation to protect 
them as well as the new plant varieties.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Usha Joshi: "Investigating the Dunkel </F>
Proposals"] 
  [Text] "The farmers are the backbone of our country and 
agriculture is the foundation on which our economy is based." 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao said this in an interview, and it 
is true in our present situation. It is important to discuss how 
much burden will be put on the farmer and how it will crumble 
our economy if the multinational companies put the stamp of 
their patent on every grain we grow. Why are our politicians and 
the government quiet about this issue and merely trying to 
comfort us? 
  Genetic engineering has reached every grain of wheat and 
paddy now. It means that various seeds can be created by 
cross-breeding special types of seeds. S. Barlow had crated a 
Mexican seed by crossing a Mexican high yield variety with a 
dwarf plant, which made the plant shorter (to withstand rain, 
winds, and hurricanes) and still produce a high yield. This 
helped bring the Green Revolution to India. We do not know how 
many fruits, flowers, grains, and plants are being experimented 
on, and how many new varieties have been created. This is being 
done in our country too, however, only at the laboratory 
research level on some special kind of pulses and some varieties 
of corn in Shimla. It is not being done at national level. Why 
are these foreigners taking so much interest in our natural 
resources? Why are they inviting our senior scientists working 
in this field to accept high positions there and having them say 
their say? Why are they collecting seeds of our fruits, flowers, 
and grains? For example, of the hundreds of varieties of mango, 
only about 50 are left now, and from among these only five or 
six varieties are recommended for growing. A time will come when 
we will have only five or six kinds of mangoes in our groves, 
and the remaining will disappear as we are not saving these 
trees or their seeds. 
  In this situation, we will have to beg these multinational 
companies, and pay them their asking price to use their patented 
hybrid variety. They are asking for ownership of patents in the 
Dunkel proposal. The same is true about their grain seeds that 
have already reached our farmers. 
  It is an excessive burden on the farmers to ask them to 
protect the seeds until sowing time so that they are not 
changed. It is important to mention here that the scientific 
expertise required for producing hybrid varieties is beyond the 
farmers. It is the government's responsibility to produce such 
seeds in "seed institutions" and make those available to the 
farmers through seeds distribution centers. The seeds stored 
with the farmers will not be protected even under ideal 
conditions, and these will not produce a good harvest. The 
farmers will be attracted to those hybrid varieties that give 
higher yield. It does not matter to them whether these are 
produced by Pioneer Seed company or one of the dozen foreign 
companies that have established themselves in India during the 
last five or six years. There is a biotechnical department at 
the ICAR in India. In addition, the National Bureau of Plant 
Genetic Resources has been established. Seeds of all varieties 
of traditional indigenous plants are stored here and will be 
kept for 30-40 years. However, only two or three kilograms of 
these seeds are stored. If we need to produce new seeds from 
them, it would take 10 years to produce them in large quantities 
for the farmers. Commerce Minister Prabanab Mukherji's statement 
that a law to keep seeds until the next harvest will be passed 
to remove the doubts about the Dunkel Draft is nothing more than 
hog wash. 
  Scientists select the best available seeds when they want to 
produce high yield seeds of any kind. From patent seeds they get 
one male and one female seed and cross them to experiment with 
different possible combinations. It takes a scientist about five 
or six years to finish this process. 
  These seeds are not stored in large quantities in major 
storages. This will force us to depend on foreign exotic seeds 
again and their patent laws will prove a major hinderance to us. 
Because of the lack of a proper long-range agricultural policy, 
we will become slaves in our own country. The package deal 
included in the Dunkel draft has this provision in it. Now, they 
do not have to send an army to defeat a nation, our stomachs 
will be controlled using this strategy. 
  The patent laws in India were for the process and not for 
the 
product, however, now under Dunkel the patent law will effect 
every technological product. For example, if a company gets the 
patent right over any lifeform, everything related will belong 
to it. In this way, developed countries will slowly entrap the 
developing and backward countries so well that we cannot even 
think about it. The Dunkel draft also proposes patenting not 
only all varieties of trees and plants but also micro organisms. 
Now we know why the foreign researchers have been collecting 
plants and herbs from our jungles and conducting research on 
them for many years. This was a well planned strategy which has 
emerged in the form of the Dunkel draft. Great Britain says that 
the Gatt agreement will result in trade worth 230 million, which 
seems to be true. Gatt, with its 107 member countries, will help 
open new channels of trade in India. It will help exchange of 
technology, increase employment opportunities, and provide rules 
and regulations for mutual trade. However, other nations are 
playing the game of giving with one hand and cutting our other 
hand by offering this package deal under Dunkel, and our 
scientists, politicians, and the government is quiet about it. 
The Dunkel draft will be signed as an agreement in Brussels on 
15 December. It is important that we make necessary changes in 
the patent laws so these work for us and present the draft to 
the people. The developed countries have used up most of their 
natural resources, and their eyes are on our virgin land now.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Infuriated by the Cabinet's </F>
Acceptance of Dunkel Draft the Opposition Stops Lok Sabha 
Proceedings" 
  [Text] New Delhi, 15 December--The opposition members 
disrupted Lok Sabha proceedings today because of their anger at 
the Cabinet's approval of the Dunkel draft. No activity was 
allowed in the Rajya Sabha except for question answer and zero 
time periods. 
  Activities in the Lok Sabha was suspended twice for one hour 
and until tomorrow. The Rajya Sabha was interrupted for 15 
minutes due to the noise by the opposition members, and was 
suspended after lunch for the rest of the day. 
  Nothing was said from the government side even after Shiv 
Raj 
Patil, the Lok Sabha president, asked for it twice. Mr. Sibte 
Razi, acting vice chairman of the Rajya Sabha, told the angry 
opposition members after lunch that the commerce minister will 
make a statement in the House, however, the opposition members 
did not accept it. 
  In the Rajya Sabha, as the activities began after lunch, the 
opposition members began to demand the commerce minister's 
statement right away. The acting vice chairman announced that 
after talks with Vice Chairman Nazma Heptullah, Commerce 
Minister Mukherji had agreed to make a statement the next day. 
The opposition members were not satisfied with it and continued 
to demand the commerce minister's attendance right then. 
  During this tumult, Mr. Padamnabham of Telagu Desam demanded 
that the commerce minister must come that very day to make a 
statement. 
  Jayapal Reddy of the Janata Dal said there was no use of a 
statement tomorrow since the government was signing the Dunkel 
draft tonight. 
  Dr. Subraynam Swami of the Janata Party expressed concern 
that the newspapers knew of the Dunkel draft, but the House 
members were not given any information. He said that they had 
been assured that the commerce minister was going to make a 
statement in the House today. However, he did not keep the 
promise. 
  Because of the noise and demand made by some members to 
cancel the meeting, Mr. Razi suspended House activities until 
tomorrow. The House activities were limited to only 10 minutes 
after lunch. 
  Sit-in: Several political parties and farmer organizations 
staged a sit-in outside Jantar Mantar to protest against Dunkel 
draft and demanded that it be fully rejected. These leaders said 
that the government should not sign on to this agreement as 
planned. 
  The sit-in against the Dunkel draft was organized by Genes 
Campaign, a non-political organization. According to Mohan 
Prakash, the leader of the group, similar protest rallies were 
organized in Ranchi, Agra, Merut, Bareilly, Jaipur, Churu, and 
many other cities around the nation. 
  Raghu Thakur, general secretary of the Samajwadi Party; 
Rajesh Tiwari, first secretary of the party's Delhi unit; 
Kumudini, general secretary of Indian People's Front; Shiv 
Mangal Siddantkar, first secretary of the Front's Delhi unit; 
V.S. Rao, parliamentary leader of Telagu Desam; Ashok Mitra, 
leader of the Communist Party of India (M); and Mahavir Singh, 
president of the Delhi unit of the Indian Farmers Union took 
part in this protest rally. 
  The leaders who addressed the sit-in said that the 
government, instead of standing firm, has bowed down in front of 
GATT. They sadly declared that the government did not try to 
protect the nation's interests.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dunkel Proposals and Us"] </F>
  [Text] The attitude of the central government about the 
dunkel Draft is vague and makes one suspicious. Commerce 
Minister Pranab Mukherji's statement last Friday in the House 
implied that the government was all but ready to approve the 
Dunkel Draft. The government is aware that prices of drugs will 
increase when we join Gatt and the farmers' use of seeds will 
also be effected. The seeds patented by foreign companies will 
become instrumental in exploiting the farmers. There has been a 
demand for one or two years to hold a national debate to direct 
the Indian government's attitude toward Gatt. This controversial 
issue was also discussed in the Parliament a couple of times, 
and proposals were also made to have a joint parliamentary 
committee study the Gatt proposals. However, the central 
government did not pay much attention to these questions of 
national importance. The government never presented the real 
picture associated with the Dunkel proposals in front of the 
people. 
  It is natural to ask whether patenting the seeds can be 
practical. It is said that Indian people will not be able to use 
leaves, fruit, and skin of the neem tree like in the past as its 
various uses will have been patented in the United States of 
America and those patent laws will be imposed on India also. The 
question arises: Why should U.S. laws be imposed in India? It 
would be unfortunate to increase prices of drugs and the result 
of this increase can be very serious. The question of state 
governments' rights were also raised in the Parliament. The 
Indian Constitution allows some rights to states and the central 
government cannot pass laws in those areas. If the Dunkel draft 
is approved, international laws will be imposed in those 
specific areas. Keeping in mind India's weak economic condition, 
it is not a secret how little involved India will be in making 
international laws. 
  India was the leader of developing countries during Indira 
Gandhi's rule. Even during Rajiv Gandhi's government, India 
refused to bow down, and other developing countries looked at 
India with hope. However, India gradually lost its right to lead 
the developing nations due to the ambiguous attitude that it 
adopted during the governments of V.P. Singh and the prime 
ministers that followed him. This resulted in the cancellation 
of the summit meeting of Group-15 and expression of helplessness 
by our commerce minister in the Parliament. The government may 
be helpless but if the new Gatt agreement results in creating 
additional problems for the people, these problems will find 
their own solutions!

<F P=106> [Commentary by Murli Manohar Joshi: "Dunkel Proposals Are </F>
Threatening Our Sovereignty"] 
  [Text] The Indian Government has announced its decision to 
sign the international trade treaty, GATT following discussions 
based on the Dunkel Proposals. The government had already hurt 
our farmers, and the textile, drugs and insecticides industries, 
but has now definitely caused an impediment for our production 
sector and thus to the nation's security itself. Not only that 
but now there are big question marks on India's economic and 
constitutional sovereignty. In a way, the republic has been 
brought to a laughable state, where the honor of the country, 
its achievements, and its very future have been laid at stake 
for a very long time ahead. GATT was established right after 
the second World War to establish and maintain international 
trading, with limited powers to oversee specific areas such as 
boundary-taxes and trade commercial agreements. Agricultural 
services, intellectual property rights, and corporate mergers 
were not in its purview. Thus GATT could only control matters 
upto our borders, and beyond that, it had no control on what 
went on inside a country especially with its economy. But, the 
new treaty makes it possible for it to have a say in many of our 
internal economic policy matters. It will be useful to briefly 
review the old GATT and why it is being revised prior to 
entering a discussion of the detrimental effects the new treaty 
is going to have on the third world, especially on India. 
  Among the advanced and rich nations, uncontrolled rivalry, 
and competition had been frequently interfering with the 
functioning of GATT. The U.S. was getting very frustrated. Its 
principal position in many areas in international trade had 
started to be challenged. In the areas of industries, 
machinization, automobiles, electronics, and agriculture, the 
advanced place held for ages by the U.S. was starting to be 
challenged by such countries as Japan, Korea, Germany, Taiwan, 
and Singapore, whose products were of equally good quality, 
enabling them to compete in international markets. This 
necessitated coming up with a new market control strategy for 
the U.S. It figured whatever losses it was facing in the areas 
of automotives, electronics, and industrial machinery, could be 
made up by introducing into the world market, services in 
banking, insurance, technology, travel, and agriculture. Since 
the West and Japan had monopolised technology, it became 
necessary to develop safeguards of rights in agriculture, 
services, and intellectual properties, and to incorporate them 
into the GATT. Based on these concerns, a review of GATT was 
initiated by the U.S. 
  It should be kept in mind that the kind of techno-economics 
the West has developed necessitates a constant market and flow 
of capital to feed it. It was figured that by bringing in the 
issue of intellectual property rights a control could be 
exercised over the market availability, but unless there is 
unimpeded entry into areas of banking, insurance, and the share 
market, capital flow and profits may not be available to the 
desired extent, through royalties, etc. The multinational 
companies were already in search of this. U.S., multinational 
firms, and other affluent nations came together in setting the 
ball in motion for a complete review of the GATT. They 
understood that if along with general agreements, specific 
requirements such as the TRIPS [Trade Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights] were to come under the purview of 
GATT, they could gain an uncontrolled supremacy over the third 
world. Rich nations would then be able to control their 
capital, market, and natural resources. This was a smooth way to 
obtain a certain standard of living for twenty percent of the 
world's population, by bringing the other eighty percent of 
humanity with all their God given resources under complete 
control and to render them ineffectual for the longest period of 
time. This was a modern treaty which could inconvenience the 
majority for the convenience of a privileged minority. The 
Third World was ensnared in this treacherous net. 
  The beginning of GATT talks was in Uruguay. There, the 
poorer nations made their objections to including TRIPS, 
agriculture, etc., in the treaty. It was the same with the 
Punta-del-Vista. India and Brazil had attempted to keep these 
issues out of GATT. We don't know what really happened after 
the round of talks in Montreal, but India and Brazil drifted 
apart, and India agreed to including TRIPS, services, 
agriculture, and genetics in GATT's realm in April 1989. 
Possibly the increasing pressure by the International Monetary 
Fund, World Bank or maybe the need India felt for loans to keep 
the budget balanced, were the factors that were ultimately 
responsible for India giving it up. An indebted nation loses its 
economic sovereignty. This is a burning example of that fact. 
India lost a golden opportunity to lead the other poor nations 
out of this quagmire. The Congress government has lost our 
economic soverignty in modernizing our economy. Then matters got 
fairly easy for the designers of the GATT, and under Arthur 
Dunkel, some new proposals to replace the old were drafted. 
This draft was referred to as the Dunkel draft or Dunkel 
proposals. The most recent debate has been of the clauses of 
this draft. Not all of the rich countries were in support of 
these proposals either. Their respective national interests 
mattered. The European interests were quite different. Two 
requirements sprung up: One, to bring about a consensus amongst 
the western nations, and two, to make the poor countries accept 
the proposals. By the fifteenth of December, the last round of 
talks were concluded, and the rich countries managed to reach an 
understanding. 
  Following the adaptation of the basic program resulting from 
the GATT talks, these affluent countries started to draft 
special jargons and interpretations for a series of industries. 
Simultaneously, a lot of force was applied in making the GATT 
decisions internationally acceptable by offering the Dunkel 
draft to be adopted as it was or with review. The GATT talking 
group is going to be proclaimed an MNO [Multi National 
Organization]. For conflicts within member nations, this MNO 
will be the authority issuing resolutions. In the UN, the voice 
of poor nations was heard vey little, and many decisions made to 
protect these countries' interests, but now this MNO may 
supersede the UNO. This new authority will eventually prove a 
threat to our sovereignty. The Commerce Minister and his 
colleagues have tried to explain to us in the Parliament that 
adopting the Dunkel proposals will enable us to play a greater 
part in the international market. They say that by not adopting 
this we will get left out. It should be remembered that when 
GATT was created in 1947, its objective was to expand world 
trade. In the past forty years, how much improvement was made 
by the rich participants? India's part lessened. In 1947, 
India gained independence, and at that time its export was 3.5 
percent [of the world market share], and it has since reduced to 
.5 percent. The G-7 countries form 12.3 percent of the world's 
population, with 66 percent GDP, and 54 percent exports. 
India's population is 16.2 percent, GDP only 1.0 percent, and 
exports only 0.5 percent. The truth is that the rich nations of 
the world support an international economic policy of absorption 
and take-overs. They do not want to give it up at any rate, and 
do not want their comfort level to be reduced even a little bit, 
even if 80 percent of the world remains hungry, destitute and 
diseased. It does not matter if they are suffering from famine, 
or dying like flies due to a severe shortage of medicines. 
French President Mitterand condemned this attitude in 1991, in 
a conference of 150 nations, and called it the rape of the poor 
nations. The fact is that in none of the eight rounds of GATT 
talks did advanced nation broach the subject of their 
authoritative behavior, they did not want to participate in 
anything that even remotely resembled such criticism. So where 
has GATT membership taken us to? The bottomline is that while 
our markets opened up to the world, our exports kept getting 
lower and lower. Therefore, when Sutherland announced the 
successful completion of the Uruguay talks, and the members 
opened bottles of champagne claiming that from now on every 
country's income will increase, and that everyone's trade will 
improve, it was the lie of the century. Well, if everyone meant 
everyone of the G-7 countries, then that of course is quite a 
different thing. After signing the treaty on international 
trade, there will be an increase of $213 billion in profits, and 
according to the World Bank, 60 percent of it will go to the 
rich nations. India's share will be $4 billion, which is 2 
percent of it. The eastern European nations' share will be only 
$700 million, and Africa's will be lesser. This treaty will 
internationalize production and the profits will go directly to 
the multinational corporations, because they will be the 
directors of the production operation. Fiscal capital will 
replace labor capital, which will prove unprofitable for a 
fund-poor nation like India. Broadcasting industries' new 
channels will propogate consumerism, and the developed nations 
will secure their market in the developing nations.The direct 
disdvantage of this will be to indigenous industries and its 
workforce.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Murli Manohar Joshi: "We Will Have To Fight </F>
To Keep Our Economic Sovereignty"] 
  [Text] Adopting the Dunkel proposals with regard to 
agriculture and food products is going to prove harmful to us. 
Its direct effect will be on our self-preservation. First, we 
will be compelled to meet 2 to 3.3 percent of our domestic 
demand for food through imports. Food products including fish, 
meat, dairy and poultry are subject to these clauses. Grants on 
food products will have to be reduced. At first, it will be 
reduced by 20 percent. Consider the fact that Japan gives 700 
percent grants. Even after giving a cut of 20 percent, 680 
percent remains.The U.S. and European nations also give some 300 
percent grants. In general, it is common to see various types of 
agricultural grants ranging from 60 percent to 150 percent. A 20 
percent reduction in it is really not much. We have only 6 
percent in grants. Further reduction would prove fatal to the 
farmer. Our commerce minister claims, since we have foreign 
exchange deficits, the Dunkel clauses will not apply to us, 
whereas the finance minister says that he has managed to get rid 
of the deficits. Now, we don't know who is telling the truth and 
who is not. The fact is though, that whether we are having 
deficits or not will be determined by GATT, depending on what 
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have to say, 
not what our own commerce, or finance minister says, and we will 
have to abide by that. 
  Cutting agricultural grants will result in fertilizer-price 
increases. Fertilizer consumption will decrease, and we have 
sown such seeds that, with the dearth of fertilizers, food 
production will also decrease. To improve production, the demand 
for certain imported fertilizers, will go up. They sell for less 
than the local fertilizers, since tariffs have been relaxed. 
this will cause the indigenous fertilizer factories to shut 
down. Asia's biggest fertilizer plant will close down with 
heavy losses, and 20 smaller ones will also shut down. 
Approximately 12 to 15 thousand laborers will become unemployed. 
As our fertilizer production closes, foreign manufacturers will 
start quoting prices as they please, and everyone knows what can 
happen. Then we will have to import food grains. The commerce 
minister says that it will not exceed 3.3 percent of our needs. 
But he is forgetting that if imports exceed 3.3 percent, then it 
will be hard to control it. The new proposals state that if food 
imports should exceed 3.3 percent, then the duty may be 
increased, and that too not more than 30 percent. Why doesn't 
he tell the nation like it is? Our food consumption includes 
defense needs. We had better decide also how much of a store we 
have in this area. This is a risky business. Our enemy can 
always take advantage of this. We should not forget that when we 
were fighting a war with Pakistan, the U.S. was sending us 
essential supplies on a weekly basis, and we had to stop 
ourselves when we had almost finished our business. We have 
attained self-sufficiency with great difficulty and now, the new 
proposal is going to ruin our farmers. The government will no 
longer determine grain prices, and the small farmer will be 
compelled to compete with dynamic pricing during harvest. It is 
possible that the foreign companies involved in food trade will 
fill their coffers at such time. With their affluence, they 
will buy out all available grains, export massively while the 
Indian market will be rendered uncompetitive, and our grain 
production will decidedly suffer. In this buy-sell, export 
scenario, there will be nothing for the Indian farmer. He will 
remain poor. Thus there is no profit in sight for the Indian 
farmer. It is also not clear how the country benefits. The 
commerce minister does not tire of saying that adopting Dunkel 
proposals will increase export opportunities for Indian 
agriculture, but he is forgetting that no country is going to 
want to import any thing before the quality and purity of our 
products are put through exacting standards. Many times 
already, Indian goods could not be exported because of not 
meeting international standards. 
  Intellectual property rights issue will seriously influence 
agriculture, animal husbandry, and the pharmaceutical industry. 
Now even seeds, and other areas of national interest in 
agriculture are laid utterly open for multinational firms to 
enter into. These companies will use their affluence and 
advertising to sell their seeds to our farmers. We have not 
forgotten the East India Company days. Paddy and wheat fields 
all through Bengal and Bihar had been converted to indigo 
fields, and slowly we grew deficient in food. There is also the 
risk that our eating habits may have to be modified. Once a 
farmer buys the seeds of these companies, he will got caught in 
their evil web. Because they hold the patents, even the seeds 
obtained from farming may remain their property. Because of 
TRIPS [Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights], 
we will have to amend and abide by our patent laws, but the 
price of drugs is certain to climb unrestrained. TRIPS will also 
end mandatory licensing and technology transfer will become 
impossible. Since it becomes possible to patent production, and 
in a way imports are being considered patented things, 
manufacturing foreign drugs locally will also have to come to an 
end. It is only natural that they will start selling at the 
import price, which will be the price of the producer. For 
example, four tablets (500mg each) of cifrolfoxesin sells in 
India for Rs.43.50, in the U.S., for Rs.300, in Pakistan for 
Rs.302.75, and in England for Rs.363.60. The price of 10 tablets 
(400mg each) of norfloxecin is Rs.33.61, in India, whereas in 
the U.S. it costs the equivalent of Rs.613.77. Similarly, 40 
tablets of famatidine costs Rs.26.24 in India, and in the U.S., 
the same costs Rs.511.78. Cancer drugs, and drugs for heart 
disease which get manufactured in foreign countries, will sell 
in India for the equivalent of their price. The removal of 
mandatory licensing and relaxing of import restrictions are 
going to result in drug manufacturers not worrying to sell for 
lesser price in India. Manufacturing patents will also restrict 
the methods of production, even if we should be able to produce 
drugs locally. Indian industry will suffer thus. Our health and 
welfare program will remain so only on paper. In the event of a 
ten-twenty fold increase in life-saving drugs, who will be able 
to procure medicines for supplying to government hospitals? 
Even as it is, we are unable to give free medicines in our 
public hospitals, and with these developments, it is going to 
become difficult to even run these hospitals. 
  The effects of TRIPS won't stop with just seeds, or drugs. 
It 
will affect our whole scientific research and industry. Our 
space and atomic programs, as well as our laboratory experiments 
will be affected. The genetic, and biochemical research 
projects will suffer. India will fall back in scientific 
achievements. In the area of public service, foreign banks have 
already infiltrated to quite an extent. Most of our businessmen 
prefer to keep their wealth in foreign banks. If allowed to 
enter the life-insurance scene, these foreign financial 
institutions have the opportunity to walk away with huge amounts 
of money. Since there is no mandatory seniority requirements 
anymore, such an entry will affect our developmental programs. 
Our backward areas will suffer even more. 
  By accepting intellectual property revisions, we will also 
have to overhaul our existing patent laws. This is an attack on 
constitutional sovereignty. The Constitution recognizes our 
right to make indigenous laws, but now we will have to adopt 
them to fit those laws made under GATT. What will happen then 
to our parliament and assemblies? The whole responsibility for 
agriculture, and pharmaceuticals rest with state governments in 
our country. But the right to revise many of their laws has now 
been given to GATT. This is an impingement of the basic rights 
of Indian citizens to food, livelihood, health, autonomy, and 
democracy. Signing this agreement amounts to ignoring the 
treaty-precedents of our country, which is the backbone of our 
Constitution. 
  This international agreement has far reaching implications, 
and the effects are not yet completely known. It will impact 
such rudimentary things as our culture, consumption, and habits. 
It will affect our politics, and our security. So, the 
significant question here is whether in signing such an 
agreement, only the executive branch of the government should be 
involved, or the approval of the Parliament and people also 
sought? Can the government be given the license to meddle with 
the very basic character of the nation? According to the Indian 
Constitution, some powers are veted with the state governments, 
and only they can make decisions with regard to these matters. 
Now may the central government take decisions in such matters 
without concurring with these state governments? Whatever rights 
have already been given to state governments through the second 
and third articles of the Constitution, may the central 
government now snatch them away, and give them to an 
international entity, without verifying the Constitutional 
provisions? Will article 253 of the Constitution provide 
extensive answers for these nagging questions? Do the citizens 
of India have the basic right to food, livelihood, and health, 
or not? Many constitutional questions like these will arise, 
and they will need to be answered satisfactorily. It is even 
more important to find out which is more important, the 
government, or the nation? Does the government have the license 
to work against the country's interests? The truth is that 
adopting such harmful proposals as Dunkel's can never be said to 
be in the nation's interest. Does any government have the 
license to let its country's future be taken hostage like this? 
It should be realized that in the GATT talks, and in the Dunkel 
proposals, the jargon mentions "contracting parties," not 
"people." 
  In the new GATT, Indian national interest has been greatly 
compromised. Throwing in the scare of seclusion, the central 
government wants to convince the nation of economic benefits, 
but it has only benefitted the already rich nations in opening 
up Indian market with the greatest ease to their goods, and in 
making India a showroom for multinational companies. In 
textiles, which was our greatest export product, we have not 
been able to get any significant breaks. Quotas still exist, and 
the European Community has only said that in ten years, they 
will open up for Indian exports. But it is not clear what 
percentage of their textile-market will be opened to us. If we 
are unable to bring things under control in textiles, we may 
face the unemployment of multitudes of workers. 
  The Indian government did not show firmness in these 
negotiations. They behaved like a `banana' republic, whose spine 
broke in just one blow. It threw down its arms in front of the 
utmost stringent international financial establishment. It was 
completely missed that being left out of certain things is not 
in itself a mistake or degradation. Since we would not sign the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we have been left out of space 
programs. But, these are the only two areas, where we have 
developed indigenous technology significantly. We must not 
forget that India's population is considerably larger than that 
of the G-7 countries together. We are a market in ourselves 
because of our huge population, natural resources, capable 
engineers, and scientists. There is a tradition here that 
started in ancient times predating Koutilya [eminent economist 
of antiquity], and we have held our place in international 
trade. The potent truth that this country could become an 
economic stalwart once again, has been ignored. The country 
should be equipped to fight to win in the battle of economic 
independence. The political parties that realize this truth must 
cast aside their minor differences and join hands towards this 
major common cause.

<F P=106> [Article by L. K. Sharma: "Biodiversity Convention Comes </F>
Into Force"] 
  [Text] London, December 30--The international convention on 
biological diversity came into force yesterday amid fears that 
the GATT agreement would make it difficult to address some of 
the issues raised by the convention. It is a pious hope that 
provisions of intellectual property rights on genetic resources 
will not run counter to the wider objectives of the convention. 
  The occasion was used by `Friends of the Earth' and the 
Labour Party to attack the British government for its failure to 
fulfil its own obligations to preserve endangered species and 
habitats. 
  `Friends of the Earth' said the British government was 
allowing imports of tropical timber that would never be 
replaced. A Labour spokesman said while the government lectured 
the Third World nations about preserving rain-forests, it was 
not protecting natural habitats in Britain. Hedgerows were being 
destroyed and these needed legal protection. 
  `Friends of the Earth' said the GATT agreement would make 
things worse in the area of biodiversity. Aid workers, 
development economists and environmentalists here have been very 
critical of the GATT agreement's impact on genetic resources and 
on small farmers, the latter constituting 80 percent of the 
total in developing countries. 
  In these countries, farmers play an important role in 
conserving local plant genetic resources and restrictions on 
free access to these will reduce global biological diversity. 
Farmers are informal plant breeders and patents on plants are 
likely to restrict access to a common pool of plant genetic 
resources, essential to plant breeding. 
  Western experts, barring those employed by biotechnology and 
seed companies, take a cautious view of the consequences of the 
extension of intellectual property protection to plant genetic 
resources for farmers as producers and conservers of 
biodiversity. They have been pointing out the irony of 
developing countries being confronted with a system which 
maintains open access over their genetic resources while 
establishing private property rights for improved products based 
on those resources. 
  They wonder whether developing countries could use the 
patent 
system to protect their "unimproved" genetic resources and use 
them as a tool in biodiversity conservation. 
  In the furious debate over GATT in India, perhaps no one 
suggested that the government could at least do what the state 
of Queensland in Australia has done. It has passed its own 
legislation giving it intellectual property rights over genetic 
information embodied in the animals and plants found in the 
state. India and other developing countries could use the 
argument that if genes, gene constructs and genetic 
characteristics can be patented in industrialised countries, 
developing countries could also patent their own genetic 
resources. 
  Of course, there are potential problems, claiming patent 
rights over genes or genetic characteristics which occur in the 
wild or in farmers' varieties would give rise to the problem of 
ownership and if that was vested in the sovereign state, 
competing claims might be made by other states. 
  The wild plant varieties as well as `landraces' and other 
farmers' varieties also will not meet the criteria that 
varieties must be distinct, uniform and stable for protection 
under plant breeders' rights. But then the system could be 
adapted. And despite such problems, it is not a developing 
country but the state of Queensland that has taken as 
initiative.[Sentence as printed] 
  A study by the Overseas Development Institute points out 
that 
pressures towards the wider granting of intellectual property 
rights over genetic material originate within industrialised 
countries and the benefits will accrue primarily to companies 
located there. The erosion of biodiversity in developing 
countries will continue as commercial agriculture expands into 
these areas. The intellectual property rights will hinder the 
protection of agricultural biodiversity, if they jeopardise 
co-operation between the formal and informal sectors. 
  Any restrictions on access to and exchange of genetic plant 
material by farmers and public sector plant breeders will have a 
negative impact in areas where a high proportion of planting 
material is not purchased. However, a lot would depend on the 
extent to which ways to protect farmers' informal exchange 
mechanism and re-use of saved seed can be implemented. 
  Agriculture in developing countries could suffer if free 
access to plant genetic resources ends, not least because the 
types of plant produced by the private commercial sector are 
unlikely to meet the diverse needs of peasant farmers. 
  Diversity is deemed important for food security at global 
and 
local levels and agriculture in practically all countries is 
heavily dependent on a supply of plant genetic resources from 
other parts of the world. The agricultural systems of the 
industrialised world are particularly dependent on plant genetic 
resources from tropical and subtropical regions of developing 
countries having most of the centres of diversity from which 
these resources originated.

  [Text] Patna, Dec. 30--The ruling Janata Dal and its 
allies, the CPM [Communist Party of India-Marxist] and CPI 
[Communist Party of India], today outsmarted the agitating 
opposition--the Congress, the BJP, the JMM(S) [Jharkhand Mukti 
Morcha (Jharkhand Liberation Front)] and the Peoples Party 
members--in stalling the proceedings of the assembly to protest 
the agreement on the Dunkel; draft by the Centre. 
  Members of both benches trooped into the well of the house 
and created unruly scenes, compelling the speaker, Mr Gulam 
Sarwar, to adjourn the house for the post-lunch session. 
  While the opposition members, mainly the Congress, rushed to 
the well of the house, shouting slogans to press for the 
introduction of the Jharkhand development council bill in the 
current session, the ruling party members also followed suit and 
vociferously demanded discussions on the Dunkel draft. 
  Significantly, the chief minister, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav, 
was 
seen encouraging members of the treasury bench to join the 
agitation in the well of the house for such a discussion and 
press for a resolution, censuring the Centre for signing an 
agreement on the Dunkel draft. 
  They accused the Centre of ruining the economic structure of 
the country by accepting the draft under pressure from the 
United States, the IMF and the World Bank.

  [Text] New Delhi, December 31--The BJP [Bharatiya Janata 
Party] has decided to focus attention on the "anti-farmer Dunkel 
draft" to refurbish its image. It has planned country-wide 
programmes to make their plan turn into a movement. 
  The party general secretary, Mr K.L. Sharma, today said the 
movement would be converted into an agitation around the time of 
the budget session in February. 
  According to the plan prepared by the general secretaries of 
the party, there would be a mass awakening programme at the 
panchayat level all over the country. The Kisan Morcha of the 
BJP has been given the charge of successfully holding these 
programmes. 
  The party intends to publish a large number of pamphlets 
which would be distributed freely among the farmers to explain 
the BJP's stand on the Dunkel draft. A comprehensive, 
documentary film is also being planned. The budget for the 
publication of pamphlets and organising meetings would be 
decided at a meeting of the Kisan Morcha to be held in Delhi on 
January 7. 
  The meeting would be presided over by the Kisan Morcha 
president, Mr Kailash Joshi, MLA [Member of Legislative 
Assembly] from Madhya Pradesh. Leaders like Govindacharya and 
others have been involved in this programme for creating a 
movement against the Dunkel draft. 
  During the first phase of the programme, which would be from 
January 15 to 31, the party intends to hold seminars and 
meetings in all major cities. The party would give the slogan of 
"kisan bachao, kheti bachao" during these various meetings. 
  The party would be decided on the further stages of the 
programme at the meeting of its "kisan morcha." 
  The BJP is also contemplating to amend its constitution to 
bring about "internal democracy with discipline in the party." 
According to sources, this move is being thought of in view of 
the growing indiscipline in the party, which had surfaced 
recently during the assembly elections. Leaders in the party 
feel that the internal squabblings were the result of the BJP's 
poor performance in the recent elections.

  [Text] Jaipur, January 3--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today expressed fear that in the liberalised 
post-GATT scenario, crucial technologies may be withheld from 
India to stunt her progress in various fields. 
  This was in spite of the fact that the new GATT deal 
ensuring 
further opening up of national economies and erosion of national 
borders as a consequence of internationalisation of business, 
innovation and technological development, he said. 
  "Yet, I foresee emergence of such trends and building of 
protectionist walls, said the Prime Minister while inaugurating 
the 81st session of the Indian Science Congress at Rajasthan 
University here. "However, I have full faith in the genius of 
Indian economists, scientists and technologists and the people 
to get around such problems." 
  In his 40-minute speech, devoted mainly to stress the 
importance of technology in the post-GATT (General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade) world environment, Mr Rao said though the new 
global agreement on ensuring free trade would affect many 
fields, its impact would be high only in some key areas. 
  Identifying these areas as textiles and clothing, 
agriculture, trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPs) 
and services, including research and development services, he 
said such sectors required a strong base in indigenous R and D 
and science and technological capabilities. 
  "With our vast reservoir of S and T personnel and 
comparatively lower manpower costs, it was possible to meet such 
challenges through appropriate R and D inputs. To make this 
happen, industry has to play a dominant part," Mr Rao stressed, 
referring to the successful examples of industrialised nations. 
  However, private industry contributed less than 15 per cent 
of national R and D investments. This should change, said the 
Prime Minister, and industry should come forward to define the 
goal areas and set targets for the scientific community. 
  While creation of wealth was important, it ws even more 
crucial to ensure its equitable distribution, said Mr Rao. He 
attributed increasing social tensions to the perpetuation 
inequity in economic development. Quoting a Sanskrit verse, he 
said prosperity for all should the purpose of our developmental 
programmes. 
  Referring to the theme of this session, "Science in India: 
excellence and accountability," he said he shall not judge the 
performance of scientists in terms of conventional yardsticks 
that are used to assess productivity. It will be left to 
scientists' own methods of judgment. 
  At the same time, there can be no judgment according to 
which 
concrete results were ignored. He quoted noted scientist Prof S. 
Chandrasekhar to stress this point: "One's place in science, as 
posterity will duly assign, depends largely on one's continuous 
exertion, at the edge of one's ability. 
  Deftly side-stepping issues of declining government 
investment in the R and D sector and allocations for the 
educational institutions voiced by the scientific community, the 
Prime Minister said industry should step up investments in 
universities too and also ensure involvement of high quality 
manpower in programmes of their interest. 
  Prof P.N. Srivastva, in his presidential speech, regretted 
"complete neglect of the education of science" and doubted 
India's competence to compete with other countries. 
  He asked the science administrators and policy-makers to 
ponder as to how the expectations and aspirations of the people 
were going to be achieved if science education continued to be 
neglected. 
  Quoting recommendations of senior scientists made to the 
government in 1990, Prof Srivastva regretted programmes to 
provide excellence in science education by establishing 
consortia of universities to work in collaboration with higher 
institutions of learning and utilising their superior human and 
material resources were not initiated. 
  He suggested at least ten per cent of the science and 
technology budget should be embarked for training of manpower in 
universities and colleges. The scientific activities of the UGC 
[University Grants Commission] should be supported by various 
concerned agencies and the departments of science and 
technology. Proper improvement will have to be made in primary 
and secondary schools as well. "If we do not do this, we will 
only be strengthening the tip of the pyramid, whose bottom is 
weak. In such a situation, we will never be able to compete with 
the world in the 21st century," Prof Srivastva cautioned. 
  The chief minister, Mr Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, asked the 
scientists to suggest ways to solve the problem of drinking 
water in Rajasthan. The governor, Mr Baliram Bhagat, also said 
Rajasthan was [a] rain deficient state having two major 
rivers--Chambal and Mahi. Scientists should help the policy 
makers in overcoming water shortage in the state. The Union 
minister of state for science and technology, Mr Bhuwanesh 
Chaturvedi, the Rajasthan minister for science and technology, 
Mr Lalit Kishore Chauturvedi, also spoke on the occasion. 
  Prof U.R. Rao, director of the Bangalore-based ISRO, [Indian 
Space Research Organization], was elected president of the next 
session of the science congress. 
  The Prime Minister today awarded nine Indian scientists for 
outstanding work in science and technology at the opening 
ceremony, adds PTI [Press Trust of India]. 
  Dr A.S. Paintal of Delhi was presented the Asutosh 
Mookherjee 
Memorial Award for his work in medical research. 
  Dr M.S. Narasimham, who is associated with the international 
centre for theoretical physics, Italy, was presented the C.V. 
Raman birth centenary award for his research in mathematics. 
  The Srinivasa Ramanujan birth centenary award was bagged by 
Prof R.P. Bambah of Punjab University in mathematics. 
  Other recipients include Dr Hari Narain, who bagged the M.N. 
Shah birth centenary award in earth science and Prof P.V. 
Sukhatme who got the P.C. Mahalanobis birth centenary award. 
  While Prof A.K. Sharma received the J.C. Bose award for 
1993-94 in citogenetics and cell biology, the P.C. Ray award for 
1993-94 was given to Prof C.N.R. Rao in the field of solid state 
chemistry. 
  Dr K.C. Binsal and Dr S.L. Kothari, jointly shared the Prof 
Hiran Lal Chakravarty award in the field of botany. 
  After the awards presentation, the Union minister of state 
for science and technology, Mr B. Chaturvedi, released a book on 
Science in India, Excellence and Accountability. Mr Bhagat also 
released a book titled Indian Science, A Selected Bibliography.

  [Text] Bangalore, January 3--The Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP) will be observing nationwide agitations demanding the 
total rejection of the Dunkel proposals from February 1 till the 
presentation of the Union budget, Mr O. Rajgopal, BJP national 
vice president, announced yesterday. 
  Addressing the Karnataka state executive committee members 
of 
the party, he said the BJP would be organising seminars, 
discussions and public meetings from January 15 all over the 
country on the adverse implications of the Centre's signing of 
the Dunkel proposals at the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade] negotiations without consulting the opposition. 
  The Dunkel proposals, shamelessly signed by the Centre 
without taking Parliament into confidence, was an affront to the 
parliamentary system as it affects the country's sovereignty and 
would harm all sections of people particularly the farmers, he 
said. 
  Mr Rajgopal said the party wanted to censure the Centre in 
Parliament on the issue but could not do anything as the left 
parties shied away from the move. "We have now decided to take 
the issue before the people and mobilise public opinion on the 
dangers of the Dunkel proposals," he said pointing out that the 
BJP would be campaigning on the Centre's failure to take any 
action on the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report on the 
securities scam involving a loot of over Rs800 crore. 
  The BJP leader, who did not make even a passing reference to 
the Ram mandir issue during his 90-minute speech, however, 
asserted that BJP was not a "single-issue party." 
  Mr Rajgopal dwelt at length on the outcome of the recent 
round of assembly elections in the north and claimed that those 
who saw the BJP nearing its end were living in a fool's 
paradise. Though the party's performance was not up to the 
expected levels, the elections have clearly established that the 
BJP's emergence as a major political party in the country, both 
in terms of securing popular votes and in the number of seats 
won. 
  Quoting electoral statistics, he said that out of a total of 
9.84 crore votes cast, the BJP grabbed 3.57 crore accounting for 
36 per cent of the popular votes cast, winning 448 seats against 
the 2.59 crore votes (10 per cent less than BJP) and 348 seats 
won by the Congress, while the Janata Dal got hardly 89 lakh 
votes and 42 seats. The BJP suffered reverses in Madhya Pradesh 
and Himachal Pradesh due to different local reasons, while its 
performance in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan was better than 
during the 1983 polls. 
  The setback in terms of number of seats for the BJP in Uttar 
Pradesh was on account of the ganging up of the Muslims and 
casteist forces under the Bahujan Samajwadi Party and Socialist 
Party alliance of Mr Kanshi Ram and Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, he 
alleged. 
  Mr Rajgopal said the BJP would be concentrating its efforts 
on Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, which were likely to go to the 
polls in April or May "We are looking for spectacular gains in 
Karnataka whenever assembly polls are held and make up for the 
loss suffered by the party in the north," he said, pointing out 
that the ruling Congress party's moves for advancing polls in 
the two southern states would benefit the BJP. 
  Mr K.S. Easwarappa, MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] and 
state BJP chief, said the party would be launching a vigorous 
state-wide campaign demanding elections to the taluka panchayats 
and zilla parishada and for rejection of the Dunkel proposals. 
"We are moving a resolution in this regard in the assembly," he 
announced.

comment] 
  [Excerpt] After seven years of negotiations, yet another 
deadline (December 15) draws near for completion of the 
international trade talks. Meanwhile, claims and counter-claims 
continue to be made about what the Dunkel Draft holds for the 
Indian economy. C. Rammanohar Reddy takes a look at the issues 
of importance to India: the proposals on textiles, patents, 
agriculture, services and foreign investment. 
  The name itself, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
[GATT], is not easily comprehensible. It is an agreement and 
also an institution. It is supposed to have the last word on 
trade issues but it has no powers to enforce its rulings. 
  In `green room' consultations at Geneva, representatives of 
the `contracting parties' to the GATT separate `amber' and 
`green' policies as they grapple with the aggregate measurement 
of support for agriculture in each country. It is appropriate 
then that one of the subjects now being discussed at the GATT 
has the acronym FOGS. To add to the opaqueness of language there 
is the lack of transparency in negotiations. Together they have 
made possible claims that range from a strong GATT ushering in 
an era of global prosperity to a GATT that will oversee 
recolonisation of the Third World. 
  As yet another deadline (December 15) draws near for 
completion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade 
Negotiations of the GATT, a flurry of activity in recent weeks 
suggests that this time the talks may be actually completed. A 
dramatic change in either the agenda or its substance will not 
take place. For the most part, the Draft Final Act--the Dunkel 
Draft--with modifications here and there will be the basis for 
final negotiations. 
  Since 1948 the GATT has overseen two aspects of 
international 
trade. One is the evolution of guiding principles for trade and 
the other is a reduction of import tariffs. Between 1948 and 
1979, seven rounds of GATT-sponsored negotiations resulted in 
average tariffs on manufactured goods in developed countries 
being brought down from 40 to five per cent. 
<H5>  Crucial eighth round </H5>
  What is unique and controversial about the ongoing eighth 
round is that on the agenda are issues completely new to the 
GATT. The impetus for beginning a new round came in the early 
Eighties from the U.S. Struggling to cope with a huge trade 
deficit and besieged by protectionist forces at home, the Reagan 
administration decided that the way out was to persuade the GATT 
to draw up a sweeping agenda that went beyond trade in 
manufactured products. 
<H5>  New issues </H5>
  Thus, when the new round was finally launched in 1986 at 
Punta del Este in Uruguay, of the 15 issues on the agenda three 
were completely new ones (services, patents and foreign 
investment) and one that had been on the fringes of GATT 
(agriculture). 
  The other 11 items on the agenda can be grouped into three 
broad areas: tariffs and trade of particular products; the 
effects of trade and, third, a review of the GATT. In the first 
area are tariffs; non-tariff measures; tropical products; 
natural resource based products and textiles. In the second area 
are safeguards, subsidies and countervailing measures; and 
dispute settlement. The third area covers multilateral trade 
negotiation agreements; GATT articles; and functioning of the 
GATT system (FOGS). 
  The proposals in all 15 subjects, as they have evolved over 
the past seven years, are important to India. But it has been 
the ones on textiles, patents, agriculture, services and foreign 
investment that have generated the most controversy. 
<H5>  Inclusion of textiles </H5>
  Since the mid-Sixties, textiles exports to the U.S. and 
western Europe have been regulated by the importing countries. 
These restrictions cover in minute detail the products and the 
quantities that each developing country--the main exporters--can 
sell in the advanced economies. The restrictions have been 
explicitly aimed at protecting the domestic clothing industries 
from external competition and they have been the inspiration for 
the innumerable voluntary export restraints that now operate in 
the European Community and the U.S. At present the restrictions 
on textiles are covered by the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA). 
  Though textiles should never have been exempted from 
coverage 
by the GATT principles of trade, it is only in the Uruguay Round 
that their inclusion has been negotiated. The agreement on 
textiles, as in the Dunkel Draft, does visualise a winding down 
of MFA restrictions over ten years. But the transition will be 
backloaded--more of the ceilings will be removed at the end 
rather than during the 10-year period. During the transition 
period, only 51 per cent of textile imports would have been 
freed from restrictions. The remaining 49 per cent are to be 
integrated `immediately' after the transition period ends. 
Moreover, products that are now outside MFA have been included 
in the list of textile products that are to be freed from 
restrictions; thereby further backloading the transition. 
  Even this transition is now under threat as the U.S. 
President, Mr. Bill Clinton, during his lobbying of support for 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, promised interested 
members of the U.S. Congress that the tentative agreement 
reached at GATT would be reviewed. 
  An early major controversy was the proposal to include 
intellectual property rights (IPRs) in the Uruguay Round. Until 
now, IPRs in patents, copyrights and trademarks have been 
covered by separate international conventions. As these 
conventions did not have universal coverage--many countries had 
independently enacted legislation--and since the U.S. and the EC 
perceived breach of their national IPRs in the low and middle 
income countries, the subject was put on the GATT agenda as a 
trade issue. The basic objective was to tighten IPR protection 
the world over. In TRIPS, there are three areas of controversy: 
the impact of proposals on the Indian pharmaceutical industry, 
patenting of micro-organisms and protection for breeders of 
seeds. 
<H5>  Product patents for drugs </H5>
  The Indian pharmaceutical industry will be affected if the 
present GATT proposals on IPRs are implemented. (In copyrights 
and trademarks the problem relates to stricter enforcement of 
existing laws). The two main issues are product patents for 
drugs and extending the period of protection. 
  For food products, chemicals and drugs the Indian Patents 
Act 
of 1970 provides only process patents. The process to make a 
product can be patented but not the product. Domestic 
manufacturers, therefore, have had the freedom to use a 
different process to make what in another country is a patented 
product. Indian companes have been able to put on the market 
`patented' medicines at lower prices. The Patents Act of 1970 
has also given the capability to Indian industry to quickly 
exploit international markets once the product patent expires 
abroad. India is not the first country to have only process 
patents. Until the late Seventies, a number of countries in 
western Europe provided only process patents for chemicals and 
drugs. 
  The GATT proposals on TRIPS call for uniform application of 
the product patent regime. No longer will Indian companies be 
able to use the process route to make drugs that are under 
product patents abroad. The life of a patent in the TRIPS 
proposals has been put at 20 years, compared to seven years for 
drugs in India and there is a 10-year transition period for 
conforming to the TRIPS proposal. 
  Amendment of the Indian Patents Act will, therefore, mean a 
rise in prices. The issue is by how much and for how many drugs. 
The prices of non-patented drugs should not be affected. The 
extent of price increases of product patented drugs is, however, 
not easy to estimate before hand. If they are produced in India 
they will not be priced at international rates, but they will 
cost substantially more than now. Drugs covered by patents in 
the advanced economies and now available here make up about 
10-15 per cent of the total number on the Indian market. 
  The GATT proposals will hurt Indian industry in the 
immediate 
term. But in looking at the issue from the point of view of 
health what is relevant is not the quicker and cheaper 
availability, at present, of drugs covered by product patents 
elsewhere but how many of such drugs are essential. 
  On the World Health Organisation's list of some 250 
essential 
drugs are 12 medicines which are under product patents in 
developed countries. 
  However, the patents issue in drugs has to be looked at in 
its entirety--research and development capability, prices and 
exports. A different perspective on entirety has informed policy 
changes by other developing countries. One by one, countries 
earlier opposed to a product patent regime have already made 
changes. Mexico, Brazil and China have all embraced product 
patents and longer protection regimes. Their perspective has 
been one of signalling to foreign investment. 
<H5>  Patenting of micro-organisms </H5>
  Also in the tentative TRIPS agreement is the proposal to 
patent micro-organisms which, if implemented, could have far 
reaching effects in the future. The Director-General of GATT, 
Mr. Peter Sutherland, has often said that under the Dunkel Draft 
the discovery of a micro-organism cannot be patented but only an 
invention. This is an extreme simplification of the TRIPS 
proposal. 
  In the GATT proposal, tabled by the U.S., a mere discovery 
of 
a naturally occurring gene sequence cannot be patented. But if 
it is purified and multiplied and is of possible commercial 
value then a patent can be taken out on the micro-organism, even 
if there is no alteration of the gene sequence. The defining 
difference is the order of human intervention. If it is 
high--irrespective of whether or not the result is man-made 
cloning as in biotechnological research--then the micro-organism 
can be patented. 
  This particular TRIPS proposal, which is being opposed by 
India, could mean that a company from one country that finds use 
for a micro-organism naturally occurring in another can, after 
suitable human intervention, obtain a patent. This could impinge 
on customary uses of the micro-organism in the home country. The 
ambiguity in TRIPS is how to decide what is a high order of 
intervention and what is novel about the invention. The latter, 
sui generis protection, that is on the cards is the 
subject of controversy. 
  There are four broad issues raised by farmers' organisations 
and the Gene Campaign. First, the traditional practice of 
farmers retaining a part of their produce for seed will no 
longer be possible nor will they be able to exchange seeds among 
themselves or modify them for use. Second, domestic research 
will be affected. Third, there will be an increase in seed 
prices. Fourth, multinational companies will take over the 
Indian seed market. 
  All these issues are linked to the provisions of plant 
breeders' rights (PBRs) contained in one kind of sui 
generis form of protection that is prevalent in western 
Europe and the U.S. and which could be the model for legislation 
in all countries. This is the Union Pour le Protection des 
Obtentions Vegetals, a convention more commonly known as UPOV. 
  There is the UPOV of 1978 which was superseded by a tighter 
version in 1991. The UPOV 1991 extends protection to all plants 
varieties. (The 1978 version was applicable to only five 
species.) It also places restrictions on farmers' [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Dunkel Crowbar"] </F>
  [Text] The eleven-hour debate on the Dunkel draft, which 
culminated in the expected walk-out of the Opposition in the Lok 
Sabha last week, was a ritual affair, including the tearing up 
of a copy of the draft agreement in the House. The Opposition 
has done a good job of articulating the fears stemming from the 
Dunkel draft; but it took the approach that since it is its 
business to oppose the Government, it needed to do no more than 
to suggest that the country should opt out of Dunkel, that is, 
pull out of GATT. That this course of action is not open to 
India or any other nation in today's unipolar world is obvious 
enough. The alternative to crowbars, of the American or any 
other variety, is a strong multilateral forum. Like other 
developing nations, India has a stake in a truly independent 
GATT. 
  True, the Uruguay round is taking the world away from 
even-handed trade; but the issue then surely is to stem this 
trend by developing a negotiating stance. The Opposition could 
have contributed to this by suggesting specific amendments to 
the Uruguay round proposals before these were consolidated in 
the Dunkel draft. Indeed, even with regard to the draft, the 
Government could have been pressured to ask for changes that 
would result in visible benefits to the country's exports. As 
things stand, the multilateral trade agreement that is to be 
finalised on December 15 and made operational from April next 
year, will improve annual world trade by $217 billion; this 
country's share in this at $207 million will be a fraction of 
one per cent. India is being fobbed off under the Uruguay round. 
This reflects the country's failure to adopt a national stance, 
stemming from a total loss of initiative following its 
submission to the IMF and World Bank-referred programme of 
economic liberalisation. 
  In the Lok Sabha debate, the Union Commerce Minister made 
brave noises: if the textile export quotas against India are 
kept in operation for 15 years (as proposed by the US), India 
will ask for a similar term for relaxing intellectual property 
rights; since the Dunkel proposals will mean a sharp rise in 
prices of drugs and pharmaceuticals, the Government will 
exercise its licensing powers, and so forth. The fact is that 
retaliatory or protective powers are not available to India 
under the Dunkel draft nor can issues be reopened at the 
ministerial-level meeting of April 1994. Worse, in the 
resurrected GATT, the US and the advanced capitalist countries 
will tend to gang up against the developing countries; if the 
multilateral forum does not suit them, there is nothing to stop 
them from acting unilaterally against India. The Government has 
mishandled the Uruguay round negotiations, failed to protect 
India's interests in international trade and yielded to the 
one-sided Dunkel draft.

<F P=106> [Article: "The Alphabet World of GATT"] </F>
  [Text] Geneva -- There's something in an acronym that trade 
negotiators love. 
  TRIMS and TRIPS, AMS and PSI, MFN and MFA, welcome to the 
alphabet world of the GATT. 
  Little wonder that initials are so popular in an 
organisation 
whose boss is called "the DG" -- short for the director-general 
Peter Sutherland. 
  GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, may be the 
world's best known four-letter word, and its signatories could 
not resist calling one of its eagerly anticipated offspring, 
GATS. 
  That's short for General Agreement on Trade in Services, 
which will govern trade in services like banking and insurance 
if the seven-year Uruguay round of talks ever ends. 
  Some of the acronyms were coined well before the round was 
launched in the sunny Uruguayan resort of Punta Del Este in 1986. 
  MFN, the most favoured nation, can claim a certain following 
among people who have followed trade disputes. It refers to a 
country offering the same favourable terms to all trade 
partners, and is a pillar of the GATT. 
  MRA, or the multi-fibre arrangement, has governed textile 
and 
clothing quotas for two decades. 
  But the round has spawned an entire constellation of 
abbreviations that spin off the tongues of envoys like curses 
from the lips of sailors. 
  There is DFA -- draft final act, for a two-year old rough 
copy of the treaty that might someday emerge. 
  There are TRIMS -- trade-related investment measures, or 
rules and regulations that can distort trade. 
  The GATT wants to protect (trade-related intellectual 
property rights), clean up PSI (preshipment inspection) and 
measure farm handouts with AMS (aggregate measure of support). 
  Negotiators want to set up a DSB (dispute settlement body) 
once it has a DSU (understanding on rules and procedures 
governing the settlement of disputes). 
  And when new rules on safeguards, grey areas, serious injury 
and amber and green policies have been accepted, they will all 
be supervised by a whole new trade watchdog. 
  GATT will become MTO -- multilateral trade organisation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Indian Must Not Give Up GATT </F>
Membership: Panel"] 
  [Text] New Delhi -- A parliamentary standing committee of 
the Commerce Ministry on Tuesday rejected the non-BJP [Bharatiya 
Janata Party] opposition parties' view that India should not 
hesitate to opt out of the ongoing Uruguay round of trade talks 
on Dunkel proposals, saying it was wrong to argue that India's 
interest would be served best by giving up GATT [General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] membership. 
  In its third report on Dunkel draft proposals, tabled in the 
Rajya Sabha by its Chairman, I.K. Gujral, the committee admitted 
the final outcome was not in the best interest of India on every 
count. But, it argued, in multilateral agreements, "it is always 
the question of give and take." 
  Stating that in today's world with increasing 
inter-dependence of nations, multilateral pacts with 
most-favoured-nations (MFN) status was advantageous as compared 
to bilateral pacts, the committee cautioned the country's 
commercial interests would be ill-served by ceasing membership 
of GATT. 
  As such, it asked India to actively negotiate to bring about 
a more reasonable balance in the proposed agreement which 
remains loaded against developing countries, and actively 
consider ways in which the sovereign economic space of 
developing countries was safeguarded by making common cause with 
other developing countries. 
  The committee is of the view that with ratification of the 
present round of GATT negotiations, the option now available 
with the US to clamp Super 301 of their trade laws unilaterally 
against any country should also cease to operate. However, it 
urged Indian negotiators to obtain specific clarifications to 
that effect. 
  Referring to individual issues that have a bearing on the 
country's economic well-being, the committee said a witness 
deposing before it stated he did not think that Indian 
agriculture would gain the export market due to reduction in 
subsidies made by the developed countries. 
  This is because the liberalisation in agriculture would be 
limited and the international support levels for their 
agricultural products would be reduced by 20 per cent only. 
  Besides, the witness argued the Dunkel text provided for 
very 
strict phytosanitary standards to be observed for agricultural 
exports. India and other developing countries would hardly be 
able to meet these standards, resulting in rejection of their 
exports. 
  The committee said the Dunkel proposals would discriminate 
against Indian agriculture as the subsidies have to be limited 
to an upper bound of ten per cent of the value of the output for 
developing countries. This might have grave implications for the 
poor resource farmers because with increasing cost of energy and 
other inputs the sectorwise subsidy might exceed this limit. 
  The committee opined that contrary to the avowed object of 
including agriculture in GATT, the result of complying with the 
Dunkel draft proposal could enable the developed countries to 
capture the food markets to developing countries and also to 
control the gene sequences, microbiological resources and 
genetic engineering. 
  It was of the view if the Dunkel draft was accepted at its 
face value, the public distribution system could come under 
severe strain and jeopardy and as such a clear understanding 
must be obtained from the GATT secretariat that the country's 
PDS [Production Distribution Sector] would not be hit in any way 
-- presently or in future. 
  Taking exception to an informal understanding that the 
traditional rights and practices of Indian farmers for 
preservation, sale and free exchange of seeds must remain 
unaffected, the committee said this might not serve the purpose 
in days to come and said these safeguards must find `specific 
mention' in the GATT. 
  Referring to trade-related intellectual property rights 
(TRIPS) the committee viewed with grave concern the impact of 
the proposed patent regime would have on India's drug prices. 
  It was of the view that specific instruments must be 
provided 
in the TRIPS agreement to ensure the patent holders did not use 
their monopoly power to cause steep increases in prices of drugs 
and also to ensure that India's fast developing indigenous drug 
industry was not "gobbled up" by the foreign multinationals. 
  "The primacy of public interests over the rights of the 
patent holders should be ensured," it added. 
  The committee said the Indian patent law had been rightly 
emphasising patenting of the process and not the product and 
this should be maintained. 
  The proposed extension of patent from the current five to 
seven years to 20 years period virtually discourages any 
research and development (R and D) and this should not be 
conceded, the committee said. It said India should insist for 
grant of automatic licensing in certain circumstances from the 
patent-holders in public interests. It said micro-organism and 
biological process should be kept out of the patent regime. 
  The committee said to sustain the ongoing modernisation of 
the Indian industry, it was important that technology transfers 
continue unimpaired. The position could be otherwise if import 
is treated as working of patents. 
  "The Dunkel draft on TRIPS militates against GATT principles 
that countries at different stages of development need to be 
treated differently in as much as the interests of developing 
countries like India have been ignored in favour of developed 
countries," the committee said. 
  On textiles and clothing, the committee said India should 
explore possibilities to get reasonable improvement in the text 
as this was one area where India's interest from a liberalised 
trade was clearly visible and there should be efforts to ensure 
the potential gains were realised. 
  The committee was also of the view the integrated dispute 
settlement mechanism as provide in the multilateral trade 
organisation (MTO) was heavily loaded against developing 
countries like India.

<F P=106> [Article by Kedar Nath Pandey: "Will India Succeed in </F>
Globalising Economy?"] 
  [Text] Indian economy is passing through many kinds of 
pulls and pressures. At one end of the spectrum, we have the 
Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, who under the benediction 
of Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, would like India to 
dispose of its economic assets to go global, because the present 
government has nothing to show on the credit side of its 
achievements. Then, there are "Swadeshiwalas" who have time and 
again expressed their reservations on the Congress Government's 
present economic policy in many spheres. The third force in 
operation is what is called the "Bombay enclave" of 
industrialists, who through the FICCI [Federation of Indian 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry] have demanding for a "level 
playing ground," and express fears about opening up the economy 
without due safeguards for indigenous sector. 
  On the political plane, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has 
let its support to this demand by stressing the need to 
strengthen Indian business before exposing it to external 
competition. The party has also called for restricting the entry 
of foreign multinationals to core sectors of the economy. 
  A rather crude formulation against multinationalism has come 
from the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (organization of 
service to the nation)] in the form of the slogan of swadeshi 
and the call to boycott consumer products of foreign-dominated 
companies. The attack on the office of the British agri-business 
giant, Cargill in Karnataka by an incensed gang some time ago 
and the company's recent withdrawal from the export-oriented 
industrial salt project in Kandla in the face of a vociferous 
campaign are the other unsavoury manifestations of 
anti-multinationalism. No wonder, former Industry Minister 
George Fernades finds the setting right for his crusade against 
some of the multinationals. 
  This built-up against multinationalism and external 
liberalisation needs to be taken serious note of in order to 
stem the misgivings that seem to be gaining ground. In 
particular, what is needed is a clear understanding of what 
needs to be done at the policy level in dispel genuine fears of 
industry. 
  While build-up against multinationalism and external 
liberalisation needs to be taken serious note of in order to 
stem the misgivings that seem to be gaining ground. In 
particular, what is needed is a clear understanding of what 
needs to be done at the policy level to dispel genuine fears of 
industry. 
  While industry leaders continue to support external 
liberalisation, they have put forth certain specific demands. 
These include a correction in the existing "inverted" duty 
structure under which the import duty on finished products is 
higher than that on capital goods, raw materials and 
intermediates; further lowering of interest rates to bring them 
down to international levels; removal of restrictions on 
inter-corporate investments; permission to borrow against 
shares; and permission to issue non-voting shares. The basic 
idea is to enable Indian industry to grow in size, to be able to 
compete against foreign multinationals and to protect Indian 
promoters against possible takeover bids by foreign moneybags. 
The government would do well to look into these demands and take 
necessary steps, not only to reassure Indian industry but also 
to blunt the edge of much of the criticism at the political 
level. 
  So far as imports are concerned, there is definitely a case 
for adjusting the tariffs in such a way that finished products 
attract a higher duty than the related capital goods and 
intermediates. The inverted tariff structure is against all 
tenets of good taxation. But short-term revenue considerations 
have held the Finance Ministry back from correcting this 
aberration. 
  The perceived strength of the Indian capital goods industry 
provided the Finance Ministry the argument for reducing the 
import duty on such goods. But there is no justification for 
subjecting the industry to unfair competition. If despite the 
inverted tariff structure, capital goods imports have not risen 
so far, it is partly because of the high cost of imports after 
the devaluation of the rupee. In this sense, the Indian capital 
goods industry still enjoys a certain measure of protection. But 
the lower imports of capital goods are also attributable to 
lower government investments and the slow pace of foreign 
investment. The crunch will come when foreign investors bring in 
their own capital goods in the form of equity to compete against 
indigenous suppliers. It is, therefore, hoped that the necessary 
correction in the present tariff structure will be made in the 
forthcoming budget. 
  As regards interest rates, again, industry's demand is 
unexceptionable. Although the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has 
brought down the lending rates by 4 percentage points since 
October last year through piecemeal reductions, the present 
rates are still almost double the average international level. 
Industry needs bank credit to meet its working capital 
requirements and to enhance its capacity utilisation. The RBI 
Governor recently stated that there would be no further 
reduction in the lending rates for some time. This is far from 
what industry had expected. 
  The RBI and the Finance Ministry are unduly paranoid about a 
sharp cut in lending rates. Their fears about inflation getting 
worse on this account do not reckon with the deflationary impact 
of increased capacity utilisation. Nor are their apprehensions 
about bank deposits coming down as a result of the concomitant 
cut in lending rates well-founded. Even if bank despite come 
down for a while and the money flows into other channels, it 
will eventually come back to the banks. 
  As it is, the spread between deposit and lending rates in 
India is too large. If despite this, some of the banks are not 
making enough profits or are in the red, it is because of their 
inefficiency. Therefore, what is needed is expeditious action to 
carry out the overdue financial sector reforms. Putting off 
further cuts in lending rates sends out wrong signals about the 
government's commitment to these reforms. 
  Provisions for inter-corporate investments as well as 
amalgamations have to be liberalised to enable Indian companies 
acquire the requisite muscle to face the competition from 
foreign multinational majors. In fact, it is time to promote 
some of our own multinationals. There are several companies in 
both private and public sectors which have the capacity to 
assume this role but are hamstrung because of government 
restrictions. For instance, the public sector BHEL [Bharat Heavy 
Electricals, Limited] can go truly global, provided it is 
allowed to raise money abroad or float its own finance company. 
We have to go a long way in revitalising the public sector which 
accounts for a major chunk of industrial investment. 
  Lowering of tariff and non-tariff import barriers and free 
inflow of foreign direct investment and technology form an 
essential part of the globalisation exercise. But in order that 
globalisation works to the country's advantage, a series of 
steps are necessary to enhance the competitive edge of the 
Indian economy. 
  Foremost, we have to strengthen our production base. And 
this 
is saying a lot. For, all impediments in the way of efficient 
production have to be removed. But the real test of the 
globalisation strategy will lie in the country's export 
capability. Apart from a strong production base, cost 
competitiveness and quality, what is imperative is a complete 
reorientation of production and marketing operations. The old 
concept of market coinciding with national boundaries has to 
give way to a new one. In today's context, market is where 
demand is -- whether at home or abroad. Hundred per cent export 
units or EPZs [Export Processing Zones] have lost much of their 
relevance. Export capability has to permeate the entire economy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dunkel-Demanding Explanation By Rao"] </F>
  [Text] Members of both houses of the Parliament agitated on 
Thursday demanding that the prime minister make a personal 
appearance to explain India's position on the Dunkel draft. The 
proceedings were postponed until Friday since nothing could be 
accomplished on the face of the turmoil. Lok Sabha proceedings 
were postponed four times and Rajya Sabha Proceedings had to be 
postponed at least three times. The members cried out slogans 
like "Selling India out to the United States," etc., in 
reference to India's signing the GATT. 
<H5>  IN THE LOK SABHA... </H5>
  Parliamentary Affairs Minister V.C. Shukla pacified the Lok 
Sabha members and arranged for the Commerce Minister Pranab 
Mukherji to read out a statement on GATT negotiations. The 
members ignored that and insisted that the consequences of 
signing GATT be discussed in the presence of the prime minister, 
instead of following that day's agenda. When the Lok Sabha 
reconvened at 2 in the afternoon, the members agitated once 
again and proclaimed that unless the prime minister came, they 
would not allow any activities to take place. 
  Ram Vilas Paswan of Janata Dal, wanted to know if the 
premier 
would come. Mr. Shukla informed them that the prime minister was 
busy entertaining the Indonesian President and to kindly allow 
the commerce minister to read the statement. He assured them 
that there was no problem in the premier himself coming 
subsequently to the parliament, and that the sentiments of the 
members would be duly conveyed to him. Janata Dal members 
insisted that the premier himself come. Somnath Chatterji 
(CPI-M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] said that Mukherji 
should be allowed to read out the statement, and the members 
could conduct the discussions the next day in the premier's 
presence. He emphasized that no other matter may be taken up in 
the meanwhile. 
  After Pranab Mukherji read the statement, the oposition 
agitated once more that the prime minister come. They proceeded 
to the center of the assembly hall and shouted slogans. In the 
midst of their shouting and agitating, the deputy speaker of the 
Lok Sabha, Mallikarjunaiya attempted to take up other items for 
discussion from the agenda, and some ministers put forth their 
issues, but in the pandemonium created by the members, nothing 
could be heard. 
  Therefore, Mallikarjunaiya announced that he was postponing 
the proceedings. When they reconvened the same scene followed 
once more. At 5 in the afternoon, the assembly was postponed for 
the the third time, and soon after to the next day! 
<H5>  RAJYA SABHA... </H5>
  The Rajya Sabha proceedings were postponed three times 
following the agitation by its members. At 1445, the assembly 
was postponed for the second time. The Speaker, Najma Heptullah 
had already requested orderly conduct and having failed to 
obtain the same, postponed proceedings. When they reconvened, 
deputing speaker Sayyad Chipte Razi announced that Pranab 
Mukherji will read the statement on Dunkel, to which there was 
vehement opposition. No one listened to what Mukherji read. 
Opposition members rushed to the center of the assembly hall. 
Since Razi's requests were being ignored, he had to postpone 
proceedings once more. 
  The question hour was held in the Rajya Sabha inspite of all 
this. When that was over, Dunkel plan was brought up and there 
was agitation again. Whenever the house reconvened, there was 
agitation and so the proceedings had to be postponed till Friday. 
<H5>  PRANAB: EXPORTS WILL INCREASE </H5>
  Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji said in parliament on 
Thursday that, since the new commercial agreements concluded are 
global in scope, India's annual exports will increase from 
Rs.31,500 million to Rs.60 billion. 
  One hundred and seventeen countries, including India adopted 
global trade agreements on Wednesday (15 December). Pranab 
briefed both houses of parliament on this and said: 
  The global expansion of trading will especially benefit 
India. There will be no adverse effect on grants, rations, 
textiles, drugs, or copyright regstration. Textile export quotas 
have been extended to 10 more years. Even though this in itself 
may not be satisfactory, the developed nations have assured that 
this quota will be removed entirely at the end of the 10 year 
period. This will help the growth and expansion of textiles. The 
developed countries of the world have reduced the tariff on 
agricultural products-exports. Therefore Indian agricultural 
products may be sold at a reduced price in the world market. 
  Japan and South Korea have loosened their hitherto firm 
stand 
of not allowing rice imports. They have changed their stand and 
will allow rice to be imported. The agreements stipulate that 
not more than 10 percent of an agricultural product's value may 
be levied as tariff on it, but the tariff India will have to pay 
is much reduced compared to the amount determined by the member 
countries, due to special concessions. Therefore, there is no 
need to fear that agricultural grants will decrease.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An Agreement Favoring the United States"] </F>
  [Text] America and Europe have reached an accord regarding 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]. Hereafter the 
GATT organization will be used as a tool to promote the 
interests of America and to trumpet America's influence. On the 
pretext of building up a flourishing international trade on the 
basis of the Dunkel draft, arrangements to strangle the 
international trade has now been completed. Developing countries 
like India will be in a miserable plight as they cannot stop the 
tide of imports from developed countries and they can not give 
adequate protection to their own indigenous industries. 
  The GATT came into being in 1948 with the object of 
rendering 
help to every country to achieve self-sufficiency in agriculture 
and industry, to regulate imports and exports and to levy 
tariffs as dictated by its national interests. But the latest 
accord makes it clear that Europe and Japan found out that they 
have no other option but to bow to mighty America's political 
and economic power and influence. Developing countries like 
India have been struggling to find a way to divert surplus 
manpower in agriculture to industrial sectors. The developed 
nations are not going to close down their industries, just to 
help the developing countries. In the United States there are 
many industrial organizations involved in metallurgy production 
and they have been operating under heavy losses for years, but 
have managed to survive thanks to the heavy subsidies from the 
U.S. Government. 
  Under the garb of protecting patents and coyprights, the 
present accord will prevent developing countries' industrial 
organizations from making any technological advances or 
discovering any new devices. Even when a couple of nations 
attempt such advances, the World Bank or the International 
Monetary Fund [IMF] will advise those nations that imports are 
better than their own production. 
  The latest GATT accord is indeed a mighty big victory for 
the 
United States of America. America successfully prevented the 
developing countries from joining hands to put up a joint united 
front, effectively forced Japan to agree to the accord and 
subdued Europe to yield to the accord. India will have to give 
up its plan of modernizing its textile and clothing industries 
with foreign technology. GATT will hereafter be a new device in 
the hands of America to threaten and subdue other nations, 
asking, "Will you do this or will you not do this for the sake 
of America?"

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: Dunkel Issue: JD (Janata Dal Demands </F>
PM's Resignation; What Is "Dunkel?"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 17 Dec- 
<H5>  Dunkel Issue: Janata Dal Calls for Rao's Resignation </H5>
  Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, by accepting the World 
trade pact at the behest of America and other industrialized 
nations, has mortgaged India's sovereignty, and therefore, he 
should resign his position, so demanded the Janata Dal [JD] on 
Thursday last. 
  One hundred and seventeen nations have agreed to the world 
trade pact. This accord will adversely affect India's 
industries, including agriculture and textiles. This will pave 
the way for foreign domination in Indian industries. Therefore, 
India should get out of the General Agreement on Tariff and 
Trade [GATT]--said 26 members of parliament belonging to the 
Janata Dal in a petition presented to the President of India. 
This information was given by one of the Janata leaders, Ram 
Vilas Baswan. 
  BJP's criticism: The Bharatiya Janata Party vehemently 
criticized the government for accepting the Dunkel draft for the 
world trade pact. 
  "Dunkel's suggestions have been widely criticized by various 
sectors, yet the Rao Government accepted them and this deserves 
to be condemned," said BJP's spokesman, Krishna Lal Sharma. 
  He said they will present a petition to the President on 
Thursday. 
  Congress Party responds: The Congress Party has claimed that 
it is the right decision to accept the Dunkel draft. The party 
spokesman, V.N. Gadgil, said that the suggestions were 
considered fully by the party and only those that demand to be 
in the best interests of the country were accepted. 
<H5>  What Is the Dunkel Draft? </H5>
  The General Agreement on Tariff and Trade is an institution 
intended to coordinate and promote trade among the nations of 
the world. This is an international organization just like the 
World Bank. It was started in 1948, after World War II with 117 
member nations. 
  In 1986 September, a GATT conference was held in Uruguay in 
South America. GATT's secretary, Arthur Dunkel, presented a 
600-page report at the conference. The report carries various 
suggestions to promote world trade. 
  It was stipulated that only those nations that agreed to 
these suggestions could be members of the GATT. 
  Those countries who agreed to the draft could not formulate 
or discover new kinds of highly potential seeds and hybrid seeds 
in agriculture. They can use only seeds that have been patented 
internationally. In the matter of agricultural production, no 
more than 10 percent could be given as subsidy for manure, 
insecticides, electricity and irrigation. 
  December 15 was the last day for the acceptance of the 
Dunkel 
draft. In the meanwhile, news was out that the central 
government has accepted the suggestions. The opposition parties 
feel that the interest of Indian farmers will be adversely 
affected.

<F P=106> [Article by Chitra Subramaniam: "Indian Manages To Get </F>
Dunkel Text on Textiles"] 
  [Text] Geneva -- In the wee hours of Wednesday morning, US 
textiles negotiator Jennifer Hillman (a friend of Hillary 
Clinton) gave up. She had spent Tuesday night and many hours 
since, trying to tell the Indian negotiators (Islamabad crumbled 
earlier on) to open up their textiles and clothes markets for 
exports. 
  Just before 4 a.m., her chief Rufus Yerxa walked into the 
room, probably to force the issue. The Indians dug in. Later in 
the day, replying to journalists wanting to know how and why 
Washington threw in the towel, chief Indian negotiator 
Ambassador Bal Krishan Zutshi said: "We didn't blink." 
  Meanwhile, EC foreign ministers approved a GATT world trade 
deal, diplomats said. Asked whether the whole deal had been 
agreed upon, a diplomat said: "Yes, it has been done." 
  Closely following the India versus United States textiles 
match were the Latin Americans, who have their heart with India 
and purse strings attached to the United States. When the 
results were declared one Latin American diplomat asked aloud 
"Why didn't India stand up to the US earlier?" 
  India has managed to save the unsatisfactory Dunkel 
proposals 
on textiles from getting worse by the skin of its teeth. Zutshi 
is the first to admit that the proposals do not give Indian 
textile goods sufficient access, but what the Americans were 
asking for would have been much worse. 
  "Textile lobbyists in the United States and the European 
Community are an unreasonable lot, some of them are the absolute 
limit," Zutshi said. So is India's chief negotiator happy? 
  "If a negotiator says he is happy, it means he has done a 
bad 
job," Zutshi told a press conference in the afternoon. "As for 
the overall results, it is too soon to say anything, only time 
will tell," he added. 
  Zutshi said India had given nothing away in agriculture, in 
so far as it had made no commitments under the agriculture 
package and had also managed to secure an understanding about 
the country's public distribution system and food securities. 
While these concerns will not be reflected in the main text, 
they will appear as footnotes. 
  The ambassador said India was not too unhappy with the TRIPS 
[Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights] texts. Two issues 
that had come for particular scrutiny related to the issue of 
sui generis for plant varieties and patenting of 
genetic material and gene patenting -- under the current 
agreement farmers would be able to replant their seeds and 
researchers rights would be safeguarded. 
  On anti-dumping rules, Zutshi said that American attempts to 
make a mockery of the rules had been somewhat circumscribed and 
that the anti-dumping text "had not been considerably" weakened. 
On the contentious issue of standard of review (panels), Zutshi 
said it was too soon to say anything but that one thing was 
certain because of it, "litigation within GATT would increase 
because countries will have recourse to one more instrument," he 
said. 
  In services and especially financial services where the US 
wants a two-track process, Zutshi said it will be kept open with 
basic commitments for six months after the multilateral trade 
organisation (MTO) comes into effect from India's point of view, 
the issue of movement of persons will also be kept open for the 
same length of time under the same conditions. 
  Early on Wednesday, the United States said that the MTO 
should be re-christened to the `World Trade Organisation.' That 
was done. The joke in town is that Washington does not like the 
world multilateral.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "In the Dark About GATT?"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi -- The National Front-Left Front leaders 
who met the President Shankar Dayal Sharma on Thursday to lodge 
their protest against the signing of the Geneva treaty on the 
GATT were in for surprise when he asked them about the 
implications of the development. 
  Janata Dal MP Nitish Kumar said, "we came back with 
impression that the President had been kept in the dark" by the 
Government on the GATT agreement. He felt the Government should 
have briefed the President about it. 
  The NF-LF delegation told the President that the Government 
had "betrayed the country and let down Parliament" since with 
the endorsement of the Dunkel proposals "India's freedom had 
been mortgaged to the dictates of the industrial powers, 
particularly the US." 
  They urged him to use his office to persuade the Government 
to reject the Dunkel draft. Prominent among those who were in 
the delegation included Sharad Yadav, Ram Vilas Paswan, S. 
Jaipal Reddy, Nitish Kumar, Srikant Jena, George Fernandes, 
Devendra Prasad Yadav (all JD), [Janata Dal] Somanth Chatterjee 
(CPI-M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist], Balayogi (TDP) 
[Telugu Desam Party] and M. Maran (DMK) [Dravida Munnetra 
Kazhagam] (Dravidian Progressive Foundation). 
  Later, talking to the newsmen Ram Vilas Paswan and Nitish 
Kumar said the Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao had no moral 
right to continue in office after having signed the Geneva 
agreement. 
  During the debate on the Dunkel draft in Parliament, 
Government posed the issue as if it were one of a choice between 
two evils: To be in GATT or to be out of it. "We reject this 
formulation. If the membership of the new GATT is tantamount to 
compromising with the sovereignty of our country, then India 
must be out of it," the delegation told the President in a 
memorandum.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rao Told To Quit for Endorsing GATT </F>
Accord"] 
  [Text] New Delhi -- An agitated Opposition on Thursday 
brought the proceedings in both Houses of Parliament to a halt 
and demanded Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's resignation for 
`compromising' the national interest by endorsing a `highly 
discriminatory' GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] 
agreement. 
  Both Houses were drowned in the din and not much business 
could be transacted as a vociferous Opposition demanded that the 
Prime Minister himself clarify the Government's stand on the 
`inequitious' Dunkel proposals incorporated in the GATT. After a 
series of adjournments both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were 
adjourned for the day. 
  As soon as the Lok Sabha met members of the National 
Front-Left Front combine rushed into the well called for the 
resignation of Rao for `succumbing' to the US pressure in 
accepting the GATT terms. They demanded suspension of the 
question hour and the Prime Minister's presence in the House to 
clarify the Government's position on the Dunkel proposals. "No 
PM no House, Prime Minister hazir ho hazir ho" -- they kept 
chanting in support of their demand for a statement from Rao. 
  In the Rajya Sabha similar sentiments were echoed with the 
NF-LF members accusing the Government of "selling out" the 
country. "The telephone call came from Washington" -- Jiban Roy 
(CPI-M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] kept shouting 
pointing to the Congress benches. However, in the morning Deputy 
Chairperson Najma Heptulla had succeeded in persuading the 
members to wait for Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee's 
statement on the conclusion of the GATT agreement at Geneva on 
Wednesday. The question hour, therefore, passed off without 
disturbances. 
  But in the Lok Sabha the Chair had to order the first 
adjournment within half-an-hour. As soon as the House met, the 
Opposition members began shouting, "Down with the US, Narasimha 
Rao istifa do." Somnath Chatterjee (CPI-M) alleged that even 
when Parliament was agitated over the consequences of the GATT 
agreement, the Indian Indian representatives participating in 
the negotiations in Geneva had welcomed it. The sole BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] member in the Lok Sabha, Jaswant Singh, 
was also on his feet joining the other NF-LF block in 
repudiating the Government stand on the issue. However, the 
party continued its boycott of the Rajya Sabha. 
  When the Upper House met again in the afternoon, the 
Opposition members trooped into the well demanding the Prime 
Minister's presence. Pranab Mukherjee, who stood up to read out 
his statement, was interrupted by the slogan-shouting members. 
"We are not listening to your speech," Jaipal Reddy (JD) [Janata 
Dal] told the Commerce Minister. The Minister's voice was lost 
in the melee. With the NF-LF members shouting slogans from the 
well, Deputy Chairperson Najma Heptulla irretedly remarked, 
"Looks like you are standing on the roadside." Unable to pacify 
the members she adjourned the Rajya Sabha for the day. 
  In the Lok Sabha while the Opposition allowed Mukherjee to 
read out the prepared statement, they were opposed to initiating 
the debate in the absence of the Prime Minister. 
  Mukherjee who was finally allowed to make a statement 
presented the treaty on the GATT signed by Indian in Geneva as a 
fait accompli for the country. "On the whole it is our 
considered judgment that India has more to benefit from the 
expansion of world trade through the Uruguay Round Agreement 
rather than pursuing any alternative course of action," the 
Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Parliament in a 
statement. 
  He sought to ally the Opposition fears in the areas of 
subsidy, the public distribution system and patented drugs.

<F P=106> [Article: "Success of GATT Talks Welcomed"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi -- Various chambers of commerce have 
welcomed the success in negotiations on General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Bansi Dhar, President of Federation of Indian Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (FICCI), said the global trade would now 
move forward with more certainty in the years ahead. 
  "The world merchandise trade of $3800 billion will be able 
to 
come out of sluggish growth which it had slipped into the last 
few years," he said, adding that world trade would grow by 8 per 
cent to 9 per cent per annum for the remaining years of the 
century. 
  N. Sankar, a president of Indian National Committee of 
International Chamber of Commerce (INC-ICC), while complimenting 
the governments of 116 countries and GATT director general Peter 
Sutherland, said that GATT round would strengthen the 
multilaterism and reduce the tempo of building trade blocs and 
scope of bilateral and plurilateral agreements on trade issues. 
  L.K. Modi, president of North Indian Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry (NICCI) said that countries like India would benefit 
because of the larger market access given in the services and 
agricultural products.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "CPP Meet To Discuss Dunkel"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi -- Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha has 
summoned a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party on Friday 
as part of efforts to contain the Dunkel fall-out within the 
ruling party. 
  The CPP [Congress(I) Parliamentary Party] general body 
called 
at short notice will be addressed both by the Prime Minister and 
the Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee on the implications of 
the Dunkel agreement. The move to call the CPP is aimed at 
pre-empting criticism from within. 
  Rumblings within the party on the sensitive issue were, 
however, evident when several members demanded that they be 
allowed to speak at Friday's general body meeting. Among those 
who claimed to have sent notice for speaking to the CPP 
secretariat are Jagmeet Singh Brar and S.S. Surjewala. 
  CPP secretary Vilas Muthemwar said that members who wished 
to 
speak would be allowed, time permitting. The meeting is 
scheduled to last 90 minutes. 
  As per the game-plan prepared by Rao managers, the Prime 
Minister after taking party MPs [Member of Parliament] into 
confidence would intervene in the on-going discussion in 
Parliament. On Thursday the Prime Minister avoided Parliament 
ostensibly because he was busy with the education summit. 
  AICC [All India Congress Committee-I] spokesman Vithal N. 
Gadgil when grilled by reporters for the party's stand on the 
GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] agreement said 
that the party supported the Government's decision taking the 
"realities" into account. "Certain realities have to be taken 
into account," he said. 
  The spokesman rejected the possibility of the President 
Shankar Dayal Sharma being kept in the dark, and pointed out 
that every Cabinet paper was routinely sent to him.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Responsibility May Not Be Shirked"] </F>
  [Text] Opposition parties have brought the Parliament to a 
stand-still the past few days, agitating for an explanation of 
India's stand on the recently concluded GATT negotiations in 
Geneva. These were based on the controversial Dunkel proposals, 
and the prime minister is being pressed for answers. The BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party], already angered by the jailing of its 
leaders, has gotten all the opposition parties together and has 
vehemently condemned India's decision to sign it. The consensus 
shown by the entire opposition in objecting to India's signing 
as a "sell out," is praiseworthy. 
  However, this realization has come too late to the 
opposition 
parties. Rao government could not take a definite stand during 
the Uruguay Round of talks which were held among specially 
formed committees, away from administration's view. The 
developing nations had not devised a common approach and any 
secondary effort by India would have only met with failure. The 
opposition parties that are raising such a hue and cry did not 
propose even a single alternative then! Our representatives did 
not have any backing to present to Europe and to the U.S., 
possible disadvantages to India in signing the pact. One of the 
reasons U.S. dominated the Uruguay Rounds is that there was no 
political stability in India. V.P. Singh Government was busy 
securing its place and was unable to give GATT issues the 
serious attention they deserved. The Chandra Shekhar regime was 
interested only in extending its time in power, and our 
politicians also had to concentrate their energies on that. 
  The Rao Government which has already subjugated itself to 
directives of major financial institutions in embarking on a 
more open trading system, could not address the true interests 
of India in Uruguay the way they should have been. Not a single 
political party is devoid of the blame of neglecting such 
serious issues of grave national consequences as multinational 
entry into our trade sector, etc., in preference to other less 
important matters. The opposition parties can only pride 
themselves for having frustrated the ruling party for 
sacrificing the country's sovereignty but no one can shirk the 
responsibility for allowing multinational authority over Indian 
indigenous agriculture, trade, and commerce.

<F P=106> [Editorial] "Rao: Concessions Obtained For Developing </F>
Nations Because Of India's Efforts"] 
  [Text] The efforts India took to review the GATT 
negotiation terms based on the Dunkel draft have paid off 
according to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. 
  Addressing the gathering of Congress Parliamentary Party 
members on Friday he said that India cannot avoid multilateral 
trade anymore; we are having to import fertilizers, machinery, 
and many other important commodities, and we have to sign the 
GATT so that there can be control in these dealings. 
  Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji spoke in a manner 
alleviating distrust and fear towards the negotiations. He 
answered questions posed by members. 
  Many members felt if this briefing had been timely, they 
could have handled the agitated opposition effectively in the 
parliament. 
  At first, when GATT's chief author/director Arthur Dunkel 
revealed his plans by means of drafted proposals, there was a 
lot of apprehension of what its consequences to the developing 
countries would be. Prime Minister Rao pointed out that the then 
prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had sent a high level delegation 
comprising of then finance minister V. P. Singh, K.C. Pant and 
others to the first round of discussions following its 
introduction. 
  Pranab Mukherji said it is not clear what the opposition 
parties are trying to say. He said that even the Gujral 
Committee recommends that it is best to stay in and negotiate 
for the most concessions. Getting out in a huff or staying aloof 
is not the right course of action. He reminded everyone that no 
party had wanted India to get out of the consortium.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "Indrajit Gupta Urges Increasing Public </F>
Awareness"] 
  [Excerpts] Indrajit Gupta, one of the senior leaders of the 
Indian Communist Party has said that there is not enough public 
awareness of an issue as serious as the adopting of Dunkel 
proposals. He urged the trade unions and political parties to 
come up with projects that can instill and improve such 
awareness. Speaking to the media at Madras Harbor on Saturday, 
he said that most of the common people did not know anything 
about the Dunkel proposals. (Arthur Dunkel drafted the proposals 
on which global trading agreemnt is being designed. The 
proposals turned out to be controversial, but with some 
revisions, most of the countries in the world have accepted 
them). 
  He said that if the trade unions and farming institutions 
co-operated in opposing the Dunkel plan, then the government 
will be compelled to re-examine its stand. He told them that 
only the initial debates on the proposals were concluded on the 
15th of December. There was a whole year for the government to 
decide on signing or rejecting it. He added that there was 
enough time for the government to re-examine its decision. On a 
specific issue that could throw light on the implications of 
entering hastily into agreements the following meeting report is 
helpful: 
  He had come to Madras to participate in the meeting of an 
action committee appointed to examine the issue of the 
methodology to be adopted in the bilateral negotiations on the 
dock-workers' salary raise. He said, "We are not opposing 
starting ports under the private sector, but we are worried how 
it will affect existing ports. No one is opposing re-organizing 
trade sectors. But we are requesting that the improvements do 
not prove detrimental to workers' interests and their jobs. 
There are already efforts to reduce the number of workers in 
ports." 
  Finance minister Manmohan Singh's repeated claims that there 
is no reduction in the work force is just a show. There are no 
jobs to meet the resultant unemployment. [passage ommitted] The 
finance department has to make decisions on about 55 sick and 
ailing industries. When they finally close there will be a big 
clash between the trade unions and the government. Since the 
government has decided to sign the Dunkel Draft, this clash may 
reach serious proportions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Textiles Will Get Into GATT `in 10 </F>
Years'"] 
  [Text] New Delhi -- India's textile exports would have to 
contend with a snail's pace integration of textiles into the 
rule-based General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) system 
for another ten years especially from its major trading partners 
of the United States and the 12-member European Union (EU), the 
Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) chairman, Ashok Chugh, 
said here Sunday. 
  In an interview to PTI [Press Trust of India] here on the 
eve 
of relinquishing his tenure as AEPC chairman, Chugh said though 
a definite time-frame of ten years has been hammered out for the 
abolition of import-quota regime embodied by the Multi Fibre 
Arrangement (MFA), the process of integration of textiles into 
GATT would be abysmally slow and in the case of EU and the US 
this would be insubstantial till the end of the tenth year. 
  Elaborating on this point, Chugh said the EU has agreed only 
for 1.4 per cent integration for the first three years, 6.9 per 
cent in the next four years and 15.4 per cent in the last three 
years. Thus, as far as EU is concerned, in seven years' time the 
textile regime under the MFA would be freed only to the extent 
of 8.3 per cent while the remainder 15 per cent in the last 
three years. 
  He said with the EU only 23.7 per cent of the total textile 
trade would be freed of the MFA and "virtually no growth has 
been given to us and we could only hope that by the end of the 
decade, the balance 76 per cent is freed at one go, which is a 
fond hope." 
  Referring to India's textile exports to the United States, 
Chugh said the integration phase ranges from three per cent in 
the first three years, 10 per cent in the next four years and 32 
per cent in the last three years. This meant, he said, 13 per 
cent integration in seven years and at the end of the ten year 
it would be 45 per cent and the remainder 55 per cent would be 
`at one go after ten years, which is again a fond hope.' 
  Chugh charged the developed countries with using the ten 
year 
phase-out time to solve their recession faced by their textile 
industry by offloading their obsolete machinery to third world 
textile exporters who were in any case liberalising their 
imports of capital goods for purchase provided to garment 
exporters. He said if only the government could release the Rs 
1.5 crore due to the council, it would apportion the sum for 
footing expenses incurred by exporters in garment fair 
exhibition abroad or for promotional work. He said in the past 
AEPC used to foot 40 per cent of expenses borne by exporters in 
trade fair participation abroad. 
  Referring to developments at home, the outgoing AEPC 
chairman 
said the government's recent move insisting on garment 
quota-brokers to deposit one lakh nonrefundable sum with Rs 
5,000 annual charges was challenged in the court. He said the 
move designed to defeat quota frauds, only helped the 
quota-brokers as they seemed to be dictating 
exporter/manufacturer. 
  Chugh suggested the garment exporters must have a choice and 
quota brokers should only be optional and wherever 
self-certification as in the case of customs would do it should 
be permitted. 
  Expressing concern over the sudden decline in non-quota 
exports recently, the AEPC said this was due to abolition of 
market development assistance (MDA). 
  Chugh also pleaded for providing ten categories of items for 
export under non-quota entitlement (NQE) which was slashed to 
five under the 1994-96 three-year garment policy. 
  He said non-quota exports had declined from 18 per cent last 
year to 10 per cent now. Chugh wanted a separate joint secretary 
in charge of garment exports so that exporters facing problems 
could have an audience with the official to sort out issues. 
This is necessary, he said, because garments exports alone 
account for 15 per cent of the country's aggregate exports. 
  He was optimistic that the current year's target of garment 
exports of Rs 10,500 crore would `surely be achieved,' provided 
the government came forward to address the basic problems 
plaguing exporters including changes in the AEPC set-up where an 
IAS [Indian Administrative Service] officer with limited tenure 
functions as director-general.

<F P=106> [Article by M.A. Deviah: "Driving Away the Multinational </F>
`Devils'"] 
  [Text] Bangalore -- He describes himself as a Gandhian 
terrorist; his adversaries call him a mad man. The Karnataka 
Government does not know what to do about him and simply ignores 
him. But, for thousands of anti-Dunkel Draft (now anti-GATT 
activists, he is a hero. Instead of restricting himself to 
merely holding seminars, carrying banners and shouting slogans, 
Karnataka Farmers' Association President M.D. Nanjunda Swamy has 
achieved the seemingly impossible: his supporters twice attacked 
and destroyed facilities belonging to the multinational seed 
company, Cargill Seeds India Limited. And even though his hand 
has been clearly indicated in the attacks, the authorities have 
neither the courage nor the inclination to take action against 
him. 
  Now with the General Agreement on Trades and Tariffs 
becoming 
reality, Nanjunda Swamy intends taking his anti-GATT show on the 
road. Starting this month, he will deliver lectures at various 
universities urging the youth to stay away from products 
manufactured by multinational corporations (MNCs). This lecture 
tour will begin at Hyderabad and will continue with Banares, 
Aligarh and Ahmedabad. On January 1, he will hold farmers' 
meetings at Dharmapuri to spread the message about how GATT is 
going to destroy them and their way of life. Tamil Nadu is a 
sore point with Nanjunda Swamy because he claims the Jayalalitha 
Government has used repressive measures to prevent anti-Dunkel 
Draft meetings in the past. 
  "As an old student of socialism, I look at MNCs as the last 
vestiges of capitalism. I call them last vestiges because they 
will be wiped out by people's movements," he says. "People in 
all countries are unhappy with GATT. That is why I believe there 
will be a global people's movement. Before the treaty, the 
people had a chance to elect their own governments which took 
care of their interests. After GATT, the role of Governments 
will be reduced in favour of the free trade regime, in other 
words the MNCs." 
  What about any more gung-ho attacks like the ones on Cargill 
Seeds facilities at Bangalore and Bellary, in North Karnataka? 
"Definitely," he says, adding that his next target will be the 
American W.R. Grace and Company, which has set up a neem 
extraction plant at Tumkur, near Bangalore. According to him the 
farmers have stayed away from W.R. Grace till now as the company 
used hexane, an explosive, in its extraction process. However, 
they are working on how to get around this. According to 
Nanjunda Swamy, W.R. Grace is attempting to patent the 
pesticidal properties of neem, an accusation which has been 
denied several times by the company. 
  Unfazed: Denials have never fazed him; he simply 
ignores them and prepares a new line of attack. Nanjunda Swamy 
is a shrewd politician, using a combination of truths and 
half-truths to whip up passions. For instance, his first attack 
against Cargill Seeds centered around the accusation that seed 
patenting, as laid out in the Dunkel Draft, would mean that 
farmers would not have the right to re-plant the seeds they have 
harvested. When this was proved false, he came up with another 
accusation -- that Cargill seed producers had destroyed 500 
acres of sunflower fields in Dharwad district of Karnataka. This 
story too proved to be false. On another occasion he accused 
Cargill of paying its seed producing farmers only Rs 3 per kilo 
of sunflower seeds acquired by them and selling it at Rs 85 per 
kilo. In reality, Cargill pays Rs 45 per kilo. 
  Cargill now conducts its operations under heavy police 
protection. But this will not deter Nanjunda Swamy. 
  He says. "What are a few cozen policemen against us? I could 
bring 6 lakh farmers to Bangalore, you think I can't take care 
of Cargill?" Along with W.R. Grace, Nanjundaswamy, intends to 
attack other multinational seed companies operating in Karnataka 
-- Pioneer Seeds, Continental Seeds and Sandoz India Limited. "I 
want to drive them out," he says. On a larger scale, the 
Association will link up with other regional groups to fight 
multinationals like Pepsi, Coke, MacDonald's, Burger King and 
Kentucky Fried Chicken. The Association is also opposing 
Madonna's tour of India next year.

<F P=106> [Article by R. Chakrapani: "Good Outlook for South Asia </F>
Forecast"] 
  [Text] United Nations, Dec. 24. Departing delegates from 
the 48th session of the General Assembly which practically ended 
today but for a few routine items were given the cheerful news 
that 1994 will mark the start of a dynamic, growth-oriented 
world economy. 
  The coming years will be especially good for South Asia, 
particularly India. According to them, India would attain an 
annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent, benefiting from its 
reform-oriented policies and by positive global economic trends. 
  Mr. Cristian Oasa, U.N. economist and director of the 
Department of Economic and Social Information, who released the 
Department's year-end global survey, gave two reasons for this 
optimism and ambivalence about the U.S. economic situation had 
ended and it was now seen headed for strong growth, and the 
Uruguay round for trade negotiations had concluded on a 
successful note. "Both these factors were not present last 
year," said Mr. Oasa. 
  African situation disturbing: While all regions of 
the world, markedly Asia, were poised for greater growth, the 
economic situation in Africa remained "disturbing," he noted. 
Output in Africa was estimated to have grown only by 2 per cent 
much less than its rate of population growth. The outlook for 
1994 was likely to be no better. 
  Referring to Asia, Mr. Oasa said the region was slated to 
remain the fastest-growing area. This was inspite of the fact 
that China was expected to grow by only 10 per cent for the 
first time in three years. 
  "India continues to accelerate out of its adjustment-related 
slowdown at the beginning of the decade" the survey said. "Its 
output in 1994 is predicted to rise at 5.5 per cent." 
  Along with the growth rate of six per cent or more in 
several 
countries, including the Republic of Korea, Taiwan province of 
China, Indonesia and Thailand, the combined growth of South and 
East Asia is expected to exceed six per cent. 
  The year-end survey predicted a rise in world trade by six 
per cent in 1994. This was an improvement over last year when 
there was a fall in world trade because of weak economic growth 
in Europe and Japan. 
  Industrialised countries were expected to enter the recovery 
phase of their economic cycles in 1994. While unemployment will 
continue to remain high in Europe, the report said the job rate 
in the United States was expected to be the highest in the 
industrialised world. 
  The survey concludes with the observation that "the spirit 
of 
cooperation that prevailed among all groups of countries in the 
last stages of the Uruguay round of trade negotiations gives 
ground for optimism. Indeed, the conclusion of the round has 
given rise to opportunities which could mark the beginning of a 
more dynamic world economy." 
  The survey is expected to be considered by the Economic and 
Social Council which holds its next session at New York next 
month. 
  Resolutions adopted: The General Assembly, working 
at top speed on Wednesday, passed a number of resolutions and 
reports sent up by its main economic committee. 
  Two resolutions on the issue of international economic 
cooperation adopted were noteworthy. One draft, strongly backed 
by the nonaligned group, asked the industrialised creditor 
nations and multilateral organisations to take additional 
measures including, cancellation or reduction, to alleviate the 
external debt burden of developing countries. The resolution 
received 146 affirmative votes in an Assembly of 184 nations but 
there was one negative vote cast by the United States. 
  Explaining its opposition to the resolution, the U.S. 
delegate said the U.N. was hardly the forum to raise this 
matter. For multilateral debts, the forum was the executive 
boards of the IMF and the World Bank and the Paris Club which, 
he said, had given debt relief to many countries. As regards 
bilateral debts, this could be usefully discussed with the 
bilateral creditors. 
  On the issue of North-South issues, the Assembly called for 
strengthening "constructive dialogue and partnership" in order 
to promote further international cooperation and development. 
Such a dialogue should be conducted "in response to the 
imperatives of mutual interests and benefits, genuine 
interdependence, shared responsibilities and the partnership for 
sustainable development."

  [Text] New Delhi--With the new thrust on exports and 
private sector, steel industry in the country faces the twin 
threat of stagnation in demand and steep hike in input costs 
besides infrastructural bottlenecks for exports. 
  The domestic demand in the current year is likely to touch 
15.4 million tonnes--slightly higher than last year's 15.25 
million tonnes (much below the projected demand) as against the 
projected demand of 17.3 million tonnes. 
  In the coming year, while the projected demand has been put 
at 18.5 million tonnes, the planning commission and sail have 
estimated it to be around 16 million tonnes. 
  In fact, the planned production for next year is likely to 
be 
around 16 million tonnes against the domestic capacity of about 
22 million tonnes leaving about 6 million tonnes of idle 
capacity. 
  According to industry sources, the stagnation in demand is 
mainly due to the recession in the steel consuming sectors like 
heavy industry, engineering and processing industry as very few 
new projects require substantial quantities of steel. 
  There has also been a heavy drop in expenditure by the 
government departments including railways which reduced its 
steel procurement during the year by 20 percent. PTI

<F P=106> [Article by Prem Kumar: "The Dunkel Dangers"] </F>
  [Text] Some areas of the Dunkel text which represent the 
kernel of the just-concluded Uruguay Round come into conflict 
with India's Constitution, especially the Directive Principles. 
Thus, the domain of domestic policy is being subjected to 
international scrutiny because of which conflicts may arise 
between our socio-economic and political objectives and 
international commitments. A conflict may also arise in exercise 
of jurisdiction by our judicial bodies and panels and 
authorities being set up under the Dunkel text where domestic 
policy issues are involved. 
  The provisions of the Dunkel text regarding subsidies are an 
important area of possible conflict. While developing countries 
with per capita income of less than $1,000 are not required to 
phase out export subsidies, there is no relaxation in their 
favour as regards nullification or serious prejudice. In any 
event, in considering the legal aspect, we should consider also 
the situation when the threshold income has been reached. 
  Now, while both in the case of manufactures and agricultural 
products subsidies for disadvantaged regions are allowed, they 
have to be given to all enterprises located there. No exemption 
is allowed for assistance given to a section of the people. 
Article 46 of the Indian Constitution enjoins upon the State the 
duty of promoting the economic interests of the weaker sections 
of the people, particularly of scheduled castes and scheduled 
tribes. In our programmes of economic assistance, there is a 
special dispensation in favour of backward classes, scheduled 
castes and tribes with respect to interest rates, margins, grant 
elements, etc. We also know that in certain industries mostly 
persons of these categories participate. In fact, some castes 
are known by their profession or industry affiliation such as 
julaha (weaver). It will be possible for another 
country to argue that goods exported by such industries 
(handlooms, carpets) or from such enterprises (National Textile 
Corporation) carry more than 5 per cent subsidy, causing 
`serious prejudice' to its interests and are actionable. Thus, 
there could be a conflict between the objectives of Article 46 
and these provisions of the Dunkel text. 
  In the same vein, supply of agricultural inputs such as 
fertiliser, at subsidised prices to farmers other than poorer 
ones defined in income terms, will attract the provisions of the 
Dunkel text regarding commitment for reduction of domestic 
support. 
  While regional development programmes are permissible under 
the text, insistence upon inclusion of criteria mentioned in 
Section 1, Article 8(b)(iii) would exclude some of the regions, 
possibly North-East, which are covered by special programmes 
such as freight subsidy. Similarly, our public distribution 
system and distribution of essential goods at subsidised prices 
is partly designed to reduce inequalities in income and various 
facilities (c.f. Article 38 of the Constitution). But these are 
frowned upon by the Dunkel text. 
  The second area for focusing attention is Article 48 of the 
Constitution. "The State shall endeavour to organise agriculture 
and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall, 
in particular, take steps for preserving and improving the 
breeds...of cows and calves and other cattle." There may be 
hindrance in the achievement of this objective by the State due 
to proposed provisions regarding patents. (Article 27 of Annex 
III to Final Act on IPRS). Since no exception is being made for 
pesticides and agricultural inputs and, even for plant varieties 
and animals, a regime of patents of sui generis 
system is to be established, there can be problems in making 
available the genetic material and propagation of improved 
breeds for general distribution to farmers. Prices of 
agricultural inputs are very likely to rise due to the 
introduction of product patents in these areas (the argument is 
only about its extent) and their use of consumption which is 
strongly correlated to prices, will be adversely affected and in 
turn this will affect agricultural production unless farmers are 
compensated by corresponding adjustment in output prices. 
Difficulty may also arise in multiplying and supplying new 
breeds of plants and animals which would negate Article 48. 
  The Multilateral Trade Organisation (Annex IV to Final Act) 
will be something of a supranational body. It would adjudicate, 
enforce and punish. Since the text brings within the ambit of 
various agreements domestic policies also, there is potential 
for conflict of jurisdiction. Our courts testing the actions 
under our laws and Constitution may hold them valid (e.g., in 
the case of foreign providers of services) while MTO may 
consider them actionable and authorise retaliation. 
  It should be noted that so far "national treatment" concept 
was applicable to goods only (Article 3, GATT). The concept is 
now being extended to entities and persons of another country in 
one's territory. Thus the Agreement on Trade in Services (Annex 
II to Final Act--Articles VI, XVII, etc.) extends to aliens, a 
right available to citizens, since many services can be provided 
only by establishment in the territory of host country. 
Restriction on extent of equity holding, aggregate foreign 
investment, limitation on number of natural persons of country 
providing services, etc., may not be possible in scheduled 
sectors (Art. XVI ibid). The jobs for citizens and national 
control would thus be affected. It will not be permissible to 
restrict transmission of data to the country of providers of 
service and their being processed there. Measures which restrict 
or require specific types of legal entity through which a 
service provider may provide a service, shall not be maintained. 
What happens to areas restricted to cooperative sector or 
small-scale sector under our Industrial Policy Resolutions? 
  Lastly, many of the policies covered by various agreements 
are within the jurisdiction of states or are concurrent 
subjects. No doubt Article 253 of the Constitution allows 
Parliament to legislate in such areas also to give effect to an 
international treaty. However, since many basic policies of 
state governments are involved they must be consulted before any 
commitment is made with respect to such areas. A ratification by 
Parliament of the emerging agreement and consultation with 
states should be necessary, contrary to past practice, as no 
such wide-ranging international agreement affecting national and 
sub-national policies and of concern to many sections of the 
people has been concluded before. After all, it will be possible 
to give effect to many of the provisions of the Dunkel text 
through legislation only.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Significant Concessions' for India </F>
Under GATT"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 27. India has managed to get 
significant concessions for the recently concluded Uruguay Round 
of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations, 
and the areas in which it will get the benefits are, 
agricultural exports services, chemicals and pharmaceuticals 
exports and even textiles. 
  This was disclosed by the Deputy Director General of GATT, 
Mr. Anwar Hoda at a discussion on the Uruguay Round, organised 
by Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies. 
  Mr. Hoda, who was formerly India's chief negotiator in the 
Uruguay Round, however, said the country would have to make 
major legislative as well as policy changes in order to fully 
reap the benefits of the GATT agreement. For instance, the 
Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act could be amended 
to provide stricter norms for anti-competitive measures by drug 
companies to allow easier recourse to competitive licensing. 
Similarly, he agreed with the participants that a legislation on 
plant breeders' rights would enable India to have greater 
control in the area of gene patenting. 
  Clarifying several issues on intellectual property rights, 
he 
said that wide ranging policy changes would have to be made in 
the field of patent laws. At the same time, drugs produced under 
present patents would not be affected. The new regime would 
apply only to drugs based on inventions made after the document 
actually comes into effect in early 1995. 
  Certain areas, he said, had not been specified clearly. 
"Public non-commercial production" of drugs, Mr. Hoda felt, 
could be applied to pharmaceuticals distributed through 
hospitals or public institutions. These areas would probably be 
clarified in the coming months. 
  Giving a comprehensive picture of what he termed the "end 
game" of GATT talks, Mr. Hoda said unilateral action was still 
possible by countries such as India, in order to gain greater 
benefits from the multilateral regime. But the U.S. would no 
longer be able to take any action under the section 301 of its 
Trade Act without reference to the newly created World Trade 
Organisation which will probably be finally set up by January 
1995. This follows ratification of the agreement by member 
countries during 1994. 
  "Exports will go up:" On exports, Mr. Hoda was 
optimistic that the country would increase its share of 
agricultural exports substantially, owing to reduction in tariff 
barriers. Wheat, rice and sugar are the commodities in which 
India could be highly competitive in world markets, he felt. The 
reduction of subsidies on the total volume of agricultural 
exports would also help. For instance, with the total volume of 
wheat trade ranging around 40 million tonnes, the reduction of 
subsidised trade would be in the region of eight million tonnes, 
thereby benefiting more efficient producers in developing 
countries. 
  In chemicals, he said industrialised countries have agreed 
to 
harmonise tariffs and bring down the average tariff levels from 
20 to 6.5 per cent. In pharmaceuticals, tariffs would be brought 
down to zero, giving a substantial benefit to India which is 
already exporting large quantities of bulk drugs. 
  Mr. Hoda said that contrary to public perception the Indian 
delegation was able to make a major contribution to the final 
agreement, greatly disproportionate to its 0.5 per cent share of 
global trade. For instance, it was not widely known that it was 
through the efforts of the Indian and Pakistan delegations that 
the developed countries agreed to end the Multi-Fibre Agreement 
and provide a specific transition period for phasing out of 
quotas. 
  Even in services, the movement of personnel was brought into 
focus by India, though the developed countries were only 
interested in other areas. He said a thin wedge had been opened 
to allow Indian personnel from consultancy and computer 
companies to be transferred and located abroad. The Indian team 
was also able to ensure that the differing airn of food 
subsidies in this country, compared to the developed world, was 
highlighted an recognised. Similarly, the import restrictions on 
consumer goods owing to balance of payment difficulties was 
accepted by GATT. 
  India also played a major role in ensuring that the three 
agreements on TRIPS (trade related aspects of intellectual 
property rights), goods and services were kept separate, he said.

"Uruguay Round: The Denouement"; first paragraph THE HINDU 
comment] 
  [Text] In defending the Dunkel Text the Government and its 
supporters are mixing up two entirely different sets of 
arguments. 
  The Uruguay Round formally concluded on the scheduled date 
of 
December 15, 1993. The flurry of negotiations towards the end 
mainly involved the two major trading partners, the United 
States and the EC and, to a limited extent, Japan, India and the 
other developing countries were on the periphery of the 
negotiations throughout. For them the final package remained 
almost the same as assembled by Mr. Arthur Dunkel, the former 
Director-General of GATT, in his celebrated text. 
  Since the adoption of the text, in order to defend its 
position the Government of India seems to have mounted a 
publicity blitzkrieg in which no holds are barred, and no 
argument or interpretation, however flimsy or far-fetched, is to 
be discarded. From all this one very nearly gets the impression 
that the final outcome of the Uruguay Round is tailor-made to 
suit India's interest. 
  It is claimed that our exports will go up by an additional 
$1.5 to 2 billions annually, that there will be a real spurt in 
our agricultural exports, that the IPR regime will bring us a 
lot of benefits, that our policies and practices in the vital 
areas of investment, food security, farmers' right to reuse and 
sell patented seed varieties, and obligation to grant minimum 
access, for agricultural imports, will remain intact. It is also 
claimed that with the adoption of the Uruguay Round we have 
emerged from the twilight of the old jaded GATT trading system 
to a new liberal "orderly multilateral trading system." 
  In defending the Dunkel Text the Government and its 
supporters are mixing up two entirely different sets of 
arguments. At one level, they are defensive and are arguing that 
India had no alternative but to accept the Dunkel Text because 
we were isolated and because we cannot keep out of the 
multilateral trading system. This implies that there is 
something intrinsically wrong with the Text, but we can neither 
avoid it nor do without it. At the other level, they go on the 
offensive and interpret the specific provisions of the Text to 
bring out how they serve India's interest. There is definitely a 
contradiction in these two sets of arguments. 
  On both the issues of India's isolation and the perils of 
India remaining outside the multilateral trading system, a 
number of related questions arise which have never been 
answered. Why did India allow itself to be isolated? When did 
the isolation occur and who were responsible for it? Were there 
any objective factors, internal or external, accounting for this 
isolation? Similarly, why did we allow ourselves to be led like 
a sacrificial lamb to the altar of the multilateral trading 
system? Did we really have no leverages at all? How about the 
size of our economy, and market, our infrastructural base and 
our trained manpower, of which we are never tired of boasting in 
other contexts? How about the bargaining value of the massive 
liberalisation that we have undertaken as a part of our 
structural adjustment programme? Were we able to take advantage 
of them? And if we were not then what were the reasons? Some day 
the Government will have to come out clean on these points. 
  Keeping these arguments of tactics and strategy aside for 
the 
time being, let us examine what we have lost and gained in 
certain key areas. In most of these areas, the Government's 
argument runs on the following lines. "We have been given a 
transitional period of 5 to 10 years. We can maintain our 
present regime for the time being. No changes need be made in 
our present policies." This is good as far as it goes. But 
should we not pay greater attention to the new international 
regimes that have been established or would emerge and see how 
we are going to fare under them rather than harping on the 
temporary relief or reprieve that we have been given? 
  The most dismal part of the score card is TRIPS. Here we 
have 
gained nothing and lost everything that we could have. In 5-10 
years time, India will no longer be able to manufacture 
life-saving drugs based on process-patent. All these drugs will 
have to be imported. Statistical figures relating to some 30 
drugs in the category show that today the United States prices 
are 2.63 times to 71.29 times costlier than those prevailing in 
India and the U.K. prices are 2.45 times to 47.88 times 
costlier. On what basis can then the Government say that the 
price increase will be only by 20 to 60 per cent. 
  Apparently, they are quoting the average figure, taking into 
account all drugs--life-saving or otherwise, and patented as 
well as unpatented. The measures the Government is talking about 
for keeping the prices at a reasonable level are in the nature 
of bravado. The Drug Control Rules will not help because there 
is no way the importers can be forced to sell the drugs they 
import at a price 5-10 times lower than what they paid. Of 
course, the Government can subsidise; but this will be at the 
cost of the exchequer. The Government will also find itself 
helpless in getting the drugs manufactured in the country 
because, according to the Dunkel Text on TRIPS, for the 
application of the patent "importation" is as good as "local 
production." Moreover, it will be extremely difficult, if not 
impossible, for the Government to ensure the working of the 
patent. There is no provision in the Dunkel Text on "compulsory 
licensing" of the kind provided in the Indian Patent Act of 
1970. The provision for "other use without the authorisation of 
the right holder" contains so many safeguards--such as offer of 
"reasonable terms and conditions," payment of "adequate 
remuneration," and all these--that it will be well nigh 
impossible to oblige the patent holder to work the patent in the 
country. Thus, we will remain perpetually dependent on the 
import of patented drugs. The much-touted argument that 
consumers can switch over from the more expensive on-patent 
drugs to less expensive off-patent drugs is misplaced. There is 
no consumers' sovereignty in the market of life-saving drugs. 
The patient goes by the doctor's prescription and the doctor 
prescribes under the influence, both direct and indirect, of the 
sales drive of the drug companies. Thus the consumers in India 
must brace for paying 3-4 times more, and in many cases, even 
high prices, for this category of drugs. 
  The new IPR regime will have a debilitating effect on our 
technological development which is a critical factor for 
economic growth. All scientific and technological activities 
based on process patenting will have to be wound up in 5-10 
years. An important source of obtaining technology, i.e., by the 
compulsory working of patents, will no longer be available. 
  It is claimed that the provisions in the Dunkel Text on 
agriculture will give a great fillip to our agricultural 
exports. This claim is highly exaggerated because our 
agricultural exports depend on a variety of factors many of 
which have nothing to do with the Dunkel Text. In the exports of 
high-value agricultural products, such as fruits, vegetables, 
plants and flowers, the price factor is not all that important. 
The two factors that are important are micro-management, and 
availability of adequate infrastructural facilities. We have to 
have much improved transportation system, refrigeration 
facilities, we have to maintain quality, ensure timely delivery 
and apply very high sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards laid 
down in the Dunkel Text. All this is not going to be an easy 
task. Besides, it should be remembered that the reduction in the 
barriers to trade in agriculture is not going to exceed 30 per 
cent on an average. It is doubtful if a 30 per cent increase in 
prices will be enough for us to break into the international 
market. Besides, this is going to be available to our 
competitors also who are all lower cost producers of 
agricultural products. 
  Finally, we should not dismiss the far-reaching consequences 
of our accepting the obligation of importing a minimum of 3.3 
per cent of our total consumption of agricultural product. This 
is bound to affect the entire pattern of our agricultural 
economy--our food security, our agricultural price system, our 
crop pattern, our subsidisation system, etc. The fact that we 
are not obliged to provide minimum access now because we are 
applying import restrictions on balance-of-payments ground is 
not much of a comfort. As already stated, we should think of the 
regime that is being put in place and not the temporary relief 
we can get. Besides, we have today accumulated a reserve of 
about $8 billions. It is now open to the IMF to certify any day 
that India is no longer facing balance-of-payment difficulty and 
the new regime should apply to it. How long shall we be allowed 
to go on invoking the GATT balance-of-payment clause? We should 
not forget that negotiators from the developed countries have 
always said that this clause provides free-ride for the 
developing countries and that one of their objectives is to 
eliminate the free-riding privilege.

  [Text] Kozhikode, Dec. 28--The 69th all-India conference of 
the Indian Medical Association (IMA) began here on Tuesday 
calling for a ban on new medical colleges, reiterating the 
demand for immunity for doctors from the Consumer Protection Act 
and appealing to doctors of Third World countries to jointly 
oppose the Dunkel proposals. 
  In his inaugural address, Dr. A.K.N. Sinha, president, 
Medical Council of India, called upon doctors to get ready to 
face "a storm which was closing in on them in the form of the 
Consumer Protection Act." Opposition to the Act was voiced 
throughout the conference which started its scientific sessions 
on December 25. Dr. Sinha described the Act as "anti-people and 
reactionary," as it would force doctors to resort to "defensive 
medicine." It would create a U.S.-type situation with lawyers 
biding their chance to sue doctors for compensation for alleged 
medical neglect. 
  He also called upon doctors to oppose new medical colleges 
as 
the doctor-population ratio was already well above the required 
level and addition of more medical practitioners was undesirable. 
  Dr. Sinha also said neither sufficient manpower nor material 
was available for setting up more medical colleges. In this 
context, he said that if the Medical Council of India were to 
enforce the norms for medical colleges, 90 per cent of the 
existing colleges, including those run by the Government, would 
lose their recognition. "The Council was not withdrawing 
recognition granted to these colleges only because it would harm 
the interests of the students," he said. 
  Cheaper drugs demanded: Dr. P.K. Choudhuri, 
representing the Tollygunge branch of the IMA, Calcutta, who was 
installed as the new national president of the IMA, expressed 
the same views and also highlighted the adverse effects Dunkel 
proposals would have on the Indian medical scene. Dr. Choudhuri 
said acceptance of the proposals would result in rise in prices 
of even life-saving drugs. Even the affluent in society would be 
affected. He urged the Government to orient policy to provide 
cheaper drugs for common diseases. Quoting the prices of 
medicines in various countries, he pointed out that drugs were 
costly in countries which had adopted product patents of the 
type advocated under Dunkel proposals. 
  Dr. Choudhuri said that if the proposals were accepted the 
prices of drugs would go down in developed countries and go up 
in developing countries. He declared that the fight against the 
imposition of Dunkel proposals would be carried on with the help 
of doctors in Third World countries. The platform of the South 
Asian Medical Association (SAMA), which was formed at the 
initiative of the IMA and comprised, Third World doctors--would 
be used for this purpose. 
  Stressing the need for a ban on new medical colleges, he 
said 
that with about 10,000 doctors emerging from colleges every 
year, there was no dearth of trained medical personnel. Against 
the ideal of one doctor for a population of 3,500, going by the 
register of the Medical Council of India, the ratio was one 
doctor for a population of 2,000 resulting in unemployment among 
doctors. 
  He also expressed concern at the circular issued by the 
Maharashtra Government to allow qualified homoeopaths and 
ayurvedic physicians to practice modern medicine. It was also 
announced that the IMA had stalled, by moving the High Court, 
the decision of the West Bengal Government to allow 
diploma-holders in community medical service (a 
three-year-course which was stopped after training three 
batches) to prescribe modern medicine. 
  Dr. K.M. Moideenkutty, chairman, organising committee of the 
conference, welcomed. Dr. V.C. Velayudhan Pillai, the outgoing 
president, presided. A souvenir and a book, "Kumud Sankar 
Ray--the visionary," was released by the Mayor Mr. T.P. Dasan. 
Dr. George V. John, State president of the IMA, Dr. D.B. Bisht 
of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. K. Mohan Kumar, 
secretary of the conference committee, and Mr. B.V. Abdulla 
Koya, MP, spoke.

<F P=106> [Article by A. M. Khusro: "Direct Foreign Investment"] </F>
  [Text] Recent policy reforms in India have given 
substantial facilities and freedoms to foreign investors, 
including a 51 percent access to equity in Indian firms and 
management control, along with other concessions. But the demand 
for more and more concessions continues and the actual foreign 
investment flow, though larger, is well below the $1 billion 
mark. 
  There are many factors which influence and attract foreign 
investment, such as security, profitability, lower tax rates, 
avoidance of double taxation, percentage of equity permitted, 
freedom to manage corporate enterprises, expectations about 
customs and excise duties and freedom to repatriate dividends 
and capital. But these and many other factors do not have the 
same weight: some factors may have a weight of one percent in 
the investors' reckoning while others may have a 30 percent 
weight. This aspect is neglected by analysts and even by 
investors themselves. In the case of India, while many of these 
factors have moved in the direction of greater facilities and 
freedoms, what is compelling in investors' decision-making and 
should weigh much more than other factors in (a) the security 
aspect and (b) the profitability. 
  Analysts within India go by the feel for policy reform while 
foreign investors, not knowing the atmosphere too well, go by 
stark logic. Within the country, one knows that most of the new 
economic policies, if not all, are non-reversible. All political 
parties which have a chance of running the government in the 
foreseeable future are committed to policy reform, including 
liberalisation, deregulation and globalisation. In their 
election manifestos, all parties, except those on the extreme 
left, have favoured liberalisation and globalisation though, for 
political reasons, they may momentarily oppose this or that 
aspect of the new policies. The moment one abstracts from the 
temporary politics of economics, it becomes clear that the new 
policies cannot be reversed: no one is going to make the rupee 
non-convertible on trade account; only the market will change 
the external value of the rupee and the market has already 
signalled that the rupee is stable. The new trends of export 
growth--a 25 percent increase in dollar terms within six 
months--point out the strengthening of the rupee. And the 
foreign exchange reserves which increased from $1 billion to $8 
billion--within two years--also run in the same direction. No 
one is going to bring Rs.2,000 crore in the budget to provide 
export subsidies once again. Industrial licensing took nearly 40 
years to build and once demolished in the last two years, no one 
is going to replace the delicensed system with a licensed and, 
therefore, controlled system. Once people taste the freedoms of 
decontrol, they do not vote for controls so easily. No one is 
going to argue for higher import duties, high excise and high 
tax rates, nor would any government feel competent in the 
foreseeable future to nationalise the Indian public enterprises. 
Those who know the milieu, know that the future will not favour 
nationalisation but denationalisation and privatisation, not 
higher but lower direct taxes, not larger customs and excise 
duties but smaller ones. If foreign investors have been allowed 
a 51 percent access to Indian equity, this proportion can only 
increase in the future and not decrease. In other words, foreign 
investors can expect with certainty a greater liberalisation 
rather than its reversal and a move towards globalisation rather 
than an inward-looking shift. 
  As for security of foreign investment, it is known to all 
that India has never defaulted on repayment or repatriation of 
capital or on the payment of interest and dividend. Foreign 
financial institutions, including the World Bank, which have 
rated the countries of the world according to national 
purchasing power, have ranked India in the fifth or the sixth 
position, with all the changes that have recently been made and 
the policy improvements that have been brought about. It is 
astonishing that international reckoners like MOODY, have not 
revised India's rating upwards, so much so that one suspects a 
degree of bias in these ratings. No wonder that investors are 
ignoring these ratings and are no longer sitting on the 
fence--with the result that each day that passes brings an 
announcement of one foreign company or another actually coming 
in with an investment thus capitalising on industrial approvals 
already given. 
  As for the expanionist market, it is clear that the market 
prospects in other countries, with the possible exception of 
China, are incomparably better in India and that should be the 
prime consideration for foreign investors. One of our 
distinguished analysts, a former Governor of the RBI, an 
illustrious civil servant and a former Ambassador to the United 
States, the late L.K. Jha, addressed the German industrialists 
at the Hanover fair in 1984 and gave them a peep into the 
future. India's GNP, Jha said, was $175 billion in 1984 and, 
given its established rate of growth, would stand around $230 
billion, or more, in 1994 (at the 1984 value). It is known that 
about 10 percent of it is spent on durable consumer goods and, 
at that rate, about $23 billion worth of durable consumer goods 
should be expected annually to be in demand in 1994 and beyond. 
German industrialists, Jha said, could plan to take advantage of 
this huge development and participate in meeting the increased 
demand either directly or through investment and technologies 
relevant to that demand. Nothing that Jha said has been 
controverted in these ten years and the scene, in fact, looks 
even better. 
  As for the security of the regime, which foreign investors 
and analysts sometimes talk about, it should be noted that 
people confuse the stability of a particular political party 
with the stability of the country. All changes of 
government--six or seven of them--since Independence, have been 
smooth and impressive. All the political parties are committed 
to reform except for momentary opposition, often to embarrass 
the government and not to actually press for a policy reversal. 
In any case, the recent elections in some northern states of the 
country would seem to confirm that even the party ruling at the 
Centre at present has no fear of being removed from power even 
though it would not matter for the stability of economic 
policies if it did yield to another political party. 
  All in all, the dominant factors for foreign investment--the 
expected direction of policy, the security, and the 
profitability in a rapidly expanding market--are the factors 
whose weight is far bigger than the sum total of other items of 
reckoning which influence foreign investment. And, as these are 
at a highly satisfactory level and are moving in the right 
direction, one can safely forecast that foreign investment will 
expand rapidly hereafter.

  [Text] The world rings in two certainties with the new 
year: capitalism and free markets are in; and the new GATT 
regime, going by what the advanced capitalist nations say, has 
firmed up free trade. The industrialised countries have no use 
for a world order that enables poorer nations to catch up with 
them. It is sufficient if the poor countries open up their 
markets to the industrialised countries. The rich countries of 
course need a decade to fully open up their markets to the rest 
of the world. Knowledge is now a commercial property without 
obligations to any one, and with the power to exercise the 
property right to restrict exports by the leaseholder. No 
chances can be taken with the Asian nations: one Japan has been 
lesson enough for Europe and America. Never has the 
international division of labour been more blatantly loaded in 
favour of the dominant. Even agriculture has not been spared. 
There are no compulsions to pull the punches in a unipolar 
world. The year that has been rung out has yielded to the 
entrenchment of the world by the advanced capitalist countries. 
  For India, the new year rings in two jarring certainties. It 
must push up exports to tackle the external debt crisis, but 
exports of manufactures will depend on how rapidly 
multinationals relocate their production in this country. This 
dependence stems from the absolute control over technology 
conferred by the new GATT on multinationals. The domestic 
private sector will also have to play second fiddle because its 
access to cheap international capital is nowhere near that 
available to the multinationals. It may seem that the public 
sector enterprises are, by virtue of their size, better-placed 
to enter into strategic alliances; however, in a world in which 
there are only two or three players in major industries, as in 
telecommunications or in heavy power equipment, strategic 
alliances will have to yield the dominant say to multinationals. 
Certainly one then is that globalisation will see the retreat of 
domestic initiative. Certainty two is that foreign investment 
will have to be accepted on terms dictated by the 
multinationals. The country will have to lump the terms, however 
outrageous (INDIAN EXPRESS report in the issue of December 31 on 
the conditions, including a 10-year tax holiday, set out by US 
West for its $351 million telecom project in India is but a 
straw in the wind). 
  The allotted role in the international order requires grant 
of fiscal giveaways, led by a drastic reduction in import 
duties. After providing for burgeoning public debt servicing, 
the fisc will have little left for investment in neglected 
infrastructure and for social sector spending. Failure to 
satisfactorily resolve the competing claims will mean low 
growth, inflation and high interest rates. Beginning with 1994, 
the travails of structural adjustment will become tragically 
visible.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Madhu Dandavate: "Developing Nations' Lot: </F>
Disquieting Outcome of GATT Negotiations"] 
  [Text] The GATT negotiations have clearly brought out two 
significant features--first, the intimidating power of the 
developing countries, particularly the United States, and 
second, the vulnerability of the developing nations to the 
pressures of the developed countries in their anxiety not to 
face isolation in the global economy. Looking out the outcome of 
the GATT negotiations, what is most discrnible is the colossal 
failure of India in initiating united and sustained efforts by 
all the developing countries, to protect their common interests 
in the face of onslaught by the giants. 
  The GATT approach regarding agriculture is most 
discriminatory. It would limit subsidies only to the upper layer 
of 10 per cent of the value of the agricultural output for the 
developing countries. This would rob the poor farmers of subsidy 
because with increasing cost of energy and other outputs, the 
sectorwise subsidy may exceed this limit. 
  The Dunkel proposal prescribes that the developing countries 
like India must import agricultural commodities to the extent of 
two per cent of domestic consumption in the first year of the 
GATT agreement to be stepped up to 3.33 per cent at the end of 
six years. The proposed relaxation of this condition about 
imports in the case of economies facing balance of payments 
crisis is not of much avail to India since our Finance 
Ministry's perception of BOP [balance of payments] crisis is 
that it is already overcome. 
  Another disturbing aspect is that insistence on procurement 
and sale of food-grains at market prices will imperil the very 
existence of the public distribution system despite the 
assurance that it will not be disrupted. There is a lot of 
ambiguity about the freedom of the farmers to multiply, exchange 
and sell the seeds. The assurance secured from GATT, even on the 
basis of the version of the Union Cabinet Minister, seems to be 
only in regard to multiplication and exchange of seeds and not 
in regard to their commercial sale. The interests of the 
agriculturalists demand that while handling the problem of 
application of the intellectual property rights to agriculture, 
the traditional rights of Indian farmers for preservation, free 
exchange and sale of seeds must remain inviolate. 
  The acceptance of the Dunkel proposal to change the 
process-oriented law, as for instance the Indian Patents Act 
(1970), to the product-oriented law will be very harmful. For 
instance, in drug industry which is subject to product patent 
law, the product patent holders will use their monopoly to 
effect sharp rise in the prices of drugs. 
  The Union Commerce Minister's contention that 80 per cent of 
the medicines were outside the ambit of the patent law does not 
make the exorbitant rise in prices of the rest of the drugs in 
any way less irksome. Merely by imposing the proposed selective 
licensing and controlquite rigid in nature, the spiralling of 
prices of drugs cannot be checked.There is every danger that 
India's growing indigenous drug industry may be swarmed by 
foreign multinationals. Under the new patent regime suggested by 
GATT, the interests of product patent holders will get 
precedence over public interest. 
  The present 1970 Patents Act based on patenting the process 
and not the product needs to be protected. The extension of the 
patent law to 20 years will adversely affect the research and 
development activities. It is also essential that micro-organism 
and biological process should be kept out of the purview of the 
patent law. On the insistence of the US, GATT has provided for 
phasing out of the multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) that governs 
exports of textiles over a 10-year period in place of a longer 
period of 15 years suggested earlier. However, this so called 
concession of reducing the time frame by five years has been 
offered only after securing an assurance from India to cut down 
import duties on synthetic textiles, thus providing the US entry 
into India's domestic market. This is bound to affect the market 
for the goods of the indigenous textile industry in India. The 
agreement on textiles is likely to adversely affect India 
because the transition period of ten years before the eventual 
opening up of the textile trade is substantially large and again 
the opening up was back-loaded, that is, the actual opening 
taking place only at the end of the ten-year period of 
transition. One cannot ignore the fact that formation of 
regional groupings like NAFTA [North American Free Trade 
Association] will result in the abolition of tariff barriers for 
member countries while maintaining for other countries in the 
GATT system the quota and the tariff regime. This is most 
harmful to India's textile trade. 
  The TRIMS [Trade Related Investment Measures] in the Dunkel 
proposal restrict power of the Government to regulate and 
control foreign investment. The provisions of the Dunkel draft 
accepted by GATT give a privileged position to foreign investors 
as compared to our own investors. While the foreign investors 
will operate with backing of their respective governments and 
will have the benefit of low interest rates, they will have no 
obligation either to abide by the indigenous content regulations 
or to make compulsory exports. The proposal for setting up of an 
Monetary trade organization (MTO) with the integrated dispute 
settlement mechanism would also allow cross-retaliation between 
the three areas of intellectual property-rights, goods, and 
services. 
  The dispute settlement mechanism as provided in MTO is 
heavily weighed against the developing countries like India. 
They can easily be subjected to cross-retaliation whereas they 
have no means to retaliate against the developed countries. We 
should therefore not be surprised if the unilateral use of the 
instrument of the special and Super 301 by the US is replaced by 
similar coercive retaliation by the multilateral instrument 
under MTO. 
  The agreement finalised by GATT is a sad reminder of how 
`Might is Right.' This can never be the motto of global bodies 
which aspire to build harmonious and congenial relations between 
various regions of the tension-ridden world on the basis of 
justice and equity. In the GATT document, one sees neither the 
liberal ethos nor the far-sighted vision of Willy Brandt, who 
produced the monumental Brandt Commission report on 
International Development Issues.

<F P=106> [Article by Venkatachala G. Hegde: "Far-Reaching </F>
Implications"] 
  [Text] Extending intellectual property protection to 
agriculture and the possibility of introduction of patenting of 
seeds will have a far-reaching impact on the development of 
Indian agricultural sector and more particularly research 
concerning biotechnology. 
  Further, in an indirect way, it will also greatly affect the 
preservation of biodiversity in the context of developing 
countries. The issues concerning the patentability of an 
invention is embodied in the "Agreement on Trade-related Aspects 
of Intellectual Property Rights, including Trade in Counterfeit 
Goods," as Annexure III of GATT agreement. 
  Article 27 (1) of this agreement specifies "..tents shall be 
available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in 
all fields of technology." This rule is, however, subject to 
three very important requirements, such as (a) it should be new; 
(b) it should involve an inventive step, that is, it should not 
occur in the normal course of its evolution; and (c) it should 
be capable of industrial application. 
  The agreement does not define these requirements in any way. 
Accordingly, the assessments as to what factors should 
constitute these requirements are to be decided by the domestic 
legislation. 
  A new technological advancement in the arena of automobiles, 
for example, should fulfill these requirements so as to become 
patentable. 
  Newness or novelty, as it is called, is taken into account 
in 
the context of inventions made anywhere in the world. The 
efficacious search for novelty depends on the efficiency of a 
patent system in locating the latest additions of that 
technology. 
  There is, however, no defined rule as to how a search should 
be conducted. In other words, the factors which influence an 
"effective search for novelty" are very highly subjective and 
contextual. 
  Patent offices and the patent examiners play a crucial role 
in this regard. 
  The Indian Patent Act, 1970, for example, provides for these 
criteria of patentability in a substantive manner while 
enunciating "opposition proceedings to a patent specification." 
  Patent specification, it is said, describes the patentable 
invention in a best possible manner in such a way that a skilled 
worker in that particular area of technology should be able to 
understand it and work it. 
  This gives rise to the following questions: What could be 
considered as the best possible manner of description of an 
invention in a patent specification? And how exactly should one 
define the scope of these patentability criteria in the context 
of a developing country where technological advancement might 
have remained at an infant state? Moreover the subjectivity 
inherent in the procedural aspects and its application will 
surely create gaps in the legislative standards of developing 
countries on the one hand, and developed countries on the other. 
  The contents of Article 27(2) outline the contexts which 
provide for exclusion of patentability of inventions. These 
contexts relate "to protect public order or morality, including 
to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid 
serious prejudice to the environment. 
  "The evaluation of these contexts call for an extensive 
subjective assessment of these legal norms within a country. 
  How to define situations which could cause serious prejudice 
to the environment? It is impossible to incorporate such 
probable situations in any domestic normative set up. 
  Which authority will conclusively decide the necessity for 
exclusion of certain sectors from patentability? On what grounds 
a nation's perceptions to preserve its public order, morality 
and environment could be questioned? The implications of this 
provision when put into practice is too uncertain. 
  Interestingly, there is no reference made in Article 27(2) 
to 
the issues concerning "national interest and security." On these 
grounds a country can always take measures which are 
appropriate; in this case, it may decide to exclude certain 
investions from patentability. 
  Even though the agreement does not make any specific 
reference to these issues, a sovereign country can always invoke 
these as a golden rule. Even the GATT's Dispute Settlement 
Mechanism cannot overlook these factors on pure objective 
grounds. A perusal of the proposals submitted by a few developed 
countries, mainly the United States, Japan and European 
Community shows us that they sought exclusion of inventions from 
patentability on the grounds of "national security and public 
interest." 
  The most controversial provision with long-term implications 
on the patenting of life is embodied in Article 27(3). It allows 
the exclusion of two categories of subject matters from 
patentability, namely (a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical 
methods for the treatment of humans or animals; and (b) plants 
and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially 
biological processes for the production of plants or animals 
other than non-biological and micro-biological processes. 
  A provision at the end of the paragraph, however, creates an 
exception by making it mandatory for the parties to "provide the 
protection of plant varieties either by patents or by any 
combination thereof." 
  It also provides for the revision of this provision after 
four years of its entry into force. Before examining the 
implications of this provision, it may be worthwhile to recount 
its ramifications as elaborated by many specialists in the 
recent times. The Ministry of Commerce holds the view that the 
provision does not impose any compulsion regarding patenting of 
seeds or other propagating material. 
  Sui generis protection, according to the Ministry, would 
imply a system which is different from other categories of 
intellectual property protection and is thus in a class by 
itself. In this regard, however, the Ministry of Commerce seeks 
to make a reference for guidance to outline the sui generis 
protection of plant varieties to the International Convention 
for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, better known as 
the UPOV Convention. 
  Further, in its view, the rights granted by the UPOV 
Convention of 1978 extend only to production for commercial 
marketing of the propagating material, whereas in the case of 
patents, it extends to production per se. In other words, plant 
varieties protected by patents would not allow farmers to retain 
even a part of their produce for sowing in the following season. 
  Sui generis system envisaged by the UPOV Convention of 1978, 
on the other hand, allows the farmer to retain the seeds. A 
revised UPOV Convention of 1991 moves that system of plant 
variety protection closer to patent system by imposing 
restrictions on the right of the farmer to retain the 
propagating material even for use on his own holding. Another 
significant change in this Revised Convention relates to the 
extension of this right not to a few genera or species but to 
the whole plant kingdom. 
  The UPOV Convention of 1991 outlines the scope of the 
breeder's right in almost absolute terms. The authorisation of 
the breeder is required as per Article 14 (1) for (a) production 
or reproduction (multiplication); (b) conditioning for the 
purpose of propagation; (c) offering for sale; (4) selling or 
other marketing; (e) exporting; (f) importing; and (g) stocking 
for the above mentioned purposes. 
  In Article 14 (2) it is, however, made clear that "in 
respect 
of harvested material, including entire plants or parts of 
plants, obtained through the unauthorised use of propagating 
material of the protected variety shall require the 
authorisation of the breeder, unless the breeder has had 
reasonable opportunity to exercise his right in relation to the 
said propagating material." 
  There are three exceptions to the breeder's Rights: (a) acts 
done privately and for non-commercial purposes; (b) acts done 
for experimental purposes; and (c) acts done for the purpose of 
breeding other varieties. The effect of these provisions in 
conjunction with Dunkel Proposals could be stated in the 
following way. For example, if a farmer gets a seed in the 
initial stages, he cannot legally sell that produce to a 
co-farmer. Therefore, every year each farmer will have to buy 
seeds. 
  In order to overcome these difficulties in any system of 
protection following features should be incorporated: (a) free 
flow of genetic resources between public and private sectors; 
(b) compulsory release and certification of varieties even for 
public agencies to check spread of unadapted varieties; (c) 
companies to compensate the public sector for the use of genetic 
stock cultivated by them; and (d) the farmer's rights and 
breeder's rights not to be changed in any way. 
  The apprehensions as regards the operative styles of 
multinational seed companies in India should also be addressed 
and proper legal mechanism should be formulated to check their 
uncontrolled growth. It is necessary in the interest of hundreds 
of indigenously managed seed companies whose priority is to 
supply uncontaminated and viable seeds. 
  The system envisaged by the Dunkel proposal will inevitably 
force most of these companies to close down or be bought over by 
the big companies. The role of these small comapnies in 
collaboration with growing co-operative sector in the arena of 
farming and effective distribution of seeds should 'be 
considered in greater detail'. 
  In the area of gene sequences, Ministry of Commerce has 
stated that it would not allow the patenting of "naturally 
occurring genes." On the other hand, genetic material which has 
been evolved by human intervention would be allowed to get the 
protection of patents. However, the Ministry should construe 
strictly the operational part of this mechanism while 
differentiating naturally occurring genes from artificial year. 
  A condition should be strictly imposed by calling for 
payment 
in commercial terms for the uses of genetic resources extracted 
from the Indian territory. These resources constitute the source 
material for the development of biotechnology and other related 
fields. 
  In conclusion, it should be stated that with the completion 
of these negotiations the global trade will enter into a new 
phase which may not be in the interest of developing countries. 
Multilateralism, for majority of the developing countries, seems 
to be a better option than the "walk alone" into an unknown and 
unspecified future. Acceptance of Dunkel proposals, on the other 
hand, may also not offer any better solution. In fact, it is no 
choice at all.

  [Text] Madras, Jan 2--The Chief Minister, Ms. Jayalalitha, 
today urged the Centre to seek safeguards against certain 
clauses in the Dunkel draft which might adversely affect the 
nation's economy. 
  In a statement, issued in her capacity also as the General 
Secretary of the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra 
Kazhagam], she said it would not be in the interest of the 
country to reject in toto the Dunkel proposal. 
However, some clauses in the draft badly hit the export-import 
trade. 
  In particular, she referred to the patent clause which could 
push up the price of imported life-saving and also locally 
manufactured drugs. There would be the need for protection 
against any such price increase. 
  Also, the provision for higher royalties on process patents 
would affect agriculture and other sectors of the economy, 
leading to price rise. Steps should be taken to obtain necessary 
safeguards for products manufactured within the country, she 
said. 
  Ms. Jayalalitha pointed out that the prices of agricultural 
inputs, including fertilizers and hybrid seeds, might also go up 
as the agreement would compel the Centre to cut subsidies. 
Necessary remedial measures should be taken to continue the 
support extended to poor farmers, she said. 
  When the countries of the world came together to sign an 
agreement particularly in the context of the changing 
international economic scenario, it would not be in the interest 
of India to live in isolation. At the same time, the Centre 
should take the steps to protect the nation against the clauses 
which would adversely affect economic growth.

  [Text] Bangalore, Jan 2--Prof M.D. Nanjundaswamy, Karnataka 
Rajya Raitha Sangha President, declared here on Saturday that 
farmers would set up seed banks in all States with a view to 
fighting proposed amendments to the Seeds Act by the Government 
in line with a GATT pact. 
  Prof Nanjundaswamy told reporters that a formal decision on 
setting up seed banks would be taken in a KRRS State executive 
committee meeting to be held at Davanagere on January 9. A seed 
bank would be opened at Kittur in Belgaum district on January 19. 
  With a view to evolving a parallel system to GATT and 
multinationals, the KRRS planned to set up seed banks which 
would help preserve seeds and also facilitate a free exchange of 
seeds between the States. Already two such centres, one in 
Karnataka and another in Himachal Pradesh--both called 
"Navdhany"--had started functioning, he said. 
  The country had been provided with one year time to sign the 
GATT pact. However, the Government behaved much as a stooge of 
the World Bank and the IMF by hurrying to amend the Seeds Act. 
There were reports that the Government was also attempting to 
discontinue subsidies in some States, against its much repeated 
assurance to protect them, he pointed out.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Jayalalitha--We Should Not </F>
Completely Reject Dunkel"] 
  [Text] India's complete rejection of the internationally 
accepted GATT is not in the national interest, according to 
Jayalalitha, the Chief Minster of Tamil Nadu. She is also the 
general secretary of the ruling party, the AIADMK [All-India 
Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]. 
  In a statement issued on behalf of AIADMK she has said: 
  "Declaring that India may not adopt the Dunkel proposal on 
international trade, will affect Indian economy and its 
export-import trade. 
  "Since certain clauses of these proposals are not favorable 
to Indian conditions, in my opinion, we should negotiate with 
the countries concerned, and work the differences out. 
  "We have been using foreign inventions, and production 
methods extensively in our industries. The new agreement 
regulates such use and will eventually necessitate paying more 
tariffs on such products. This may affect our agricultural and 
other sectors. 
  "We must study the ways in which we can alleviate any undue 
burdens this might cause us since we are producing these items, 
even if with foreign assistance. We must aim at keeping prices 
under control." 
<H3>  REQUEST TO DELHI: </H3>
"Adopting these proposals has caused the central government to 
rescind several grants that it was previously giving. There is 
the likelihood of facing inflationary prices in fertilizers and 
genetically-improved seeds. The central government should devise 
ways to keep up the grants and make the new system work for the 
multitudes of indigent Indian farmers. 
  "In the area of pharmaceuticals, it is going to be mandated 
that a considerable sum of royalties be paid to foreign 
countries, if their inventions and discoveries resulted in the 
original manufacture. This is because of revised patent and 
copyright laws and review of intellectual property rights 
world-wide. 
  "Some life-saving drugs sell for very high price in foreign 
countries. We will have to sell them at comparable prices, 
should we import them. Thus either way drug prices are going to 
go up in India. The central government will have to come up with 
recommendations to control this situation. 
  "In a changing world economy, when all the countries 
cooperate to come up with a general agreement, it is not prudent 
for India to stay aloof, since it will affect our economy. At 
the same time, we have a responsibility to our citizens and 
absolutely have to study how to really adopt these rules to our 
indigenous conditions and requirements. 
  "We have to live in harmony with the world, and safeguard 
our 
special interest as well. I hope that the central government 
will take all the necessary steps to do the same."

<F P=106> [Article by Kamal Nayan Kabra, professor in the Indian </F>
Institute of Public Administration: "GATT and India: The other 
Face"; first paragraph THE HINDU comment] 
  [Text] "The sacrifices imposed on India through the GATT 
are but a component of the reckless, fundamentalist drive to 
implement the structural adjustment programme." 
  Nations do not enter into treaties and agreements, 
multilaterally or bilaterally, on the basis simply of the 
calculus of gain or loss of so many rupees or dollars. 
Certainly, questions of national sovereignty, equality of 
participation in decision-making processes, status, impact on 
national psyche, signals emanating from the process and content 
of the negotiations, etc., are no less relevant. But much the 
more basic are the questions of national priorities, development 
policies, domestic power balance and the way we place and view 
ourselves in the comity of nations. These factors matter since 
the recent GATT agreement among 117 nations and the proposed 
setting up of a World Trade Organisation (WTO) are going to have 
a far-reaching impact on the emergent world order. 
  What kind of world order the GATT agreement would lead to? 
An 
indication of it may be had from the reported statement of the 
U.S. President claiming success through the GATT agreement for 
the continued leadership (read, hegemony) of the world economy 
for his country. 
  This seems to be no empty boast. The G.7 and the United 
States have asserted their one-up-manship at every step: the 
determination of the agenda, the process of negotiations, the 
Draft Final Act and the final Act. A quick reflection would make 
it clear that our sins of commission and omission have 
contributed to this outcome in no small measure. 
  Let us see how. The Third World countries have a majority in 
that GATT which works on the basis of 'one country one vote' and 
without veto power with any country. The agreement is hammered 
out through a protracted process of negotiations providing 
opportunities for detailed home work, marshalling of theoretical 
and empirical arguments, articulation of individual country and 
group interests, preparation of alternative scenarios based on 
different negotiating stances, with ample time for pre-and-post 
agreement contingency plans in order to be able to acquire the 
necessary strength to back up one's negotiating minimum and 
maximal positions mobilisation of both domestic and 
international public opinion and preparation of the country to 
take up the gauntlet in case extra-economic or extra-trade 
pressures are being brought to bear on the negotiations process 
for tilting the scales against our interests. Since there have 
been slips up throughout this process, little wonder one throws 
up one's hands in despair at the end and bemoans or takes 
shelter behind the facade of no-availability of any option but 
to give in. 
  Since trade policy has significant linkages with all the 
real and financial sphere policies, our capacity to strike a 
good bargain would depend on our overall policy regime which 
spell out our options and the capacity to withstand pressures. 
If we are critically dependent on external finance, technology, 
supplies of essential commodities and have downplayed the role 
of internal articulation and mobilisation as the kingpins of our 
development, little wonder we make ourselves easy prey to 
armstwisting. Thus invoking of the TINA (there is no 
alternative) is an acknowledgement of the extent to which 
autonomous national development linked with the forces of social 
justice has been neglected and bungled. Our negotiating 
positions are essentially a reflection of the relative weight of 
various domestic stakeholders, say, for instance, the relative 
balance between import and export dependent sections, and those 
whose economic fortunes depend but marginally on the factors and 
forces beyond our boundaries. The domestic political economy of 
our stand on GATT derives from a further differentiation among 
the divergent interests of our extant and potential partners in 
the external economic area, particularly those whose appetite 
for foreign exchange and the craze for the "phoren" have made 
export earnings such a great "national" cause that no price 
seems too high for these. And the price of treating exports as 
an overriding objective includes diversion of domestic supplies 
causing rampant malnutrition, larger allocation for export 
production with high import and capital intensity causing 
unemployment, unrequited income transfers in favour of our 
trading partners via worsening terms of trade and depreciating 
rupee, environmental degradation, and concentration of benefits 
from such trade in the hands of a few lakh exporters and 
importers. Judging further on the basis of official admission 
that in signing the GATT agreement we have made the best of a 
bad bargain, let us examine some of the implications of the 
acceptance of the final act. 
  The basic thrust of GATT agreement is to assure market 
access 
to goods by bringing down and/or eliminating tariffs, something 
which had been agreed upon by both the developed and the 
developing countries. It is claimed that this would spur a big 
spurt in world trade from which countries like India too would 
benefit. As a price for it the developing countries have given 
an undertaking not to raise the tariffs, in future also. In case 
of balance of payment difficulties, they have to use 
quantitative restrictions only. 
  It is too mechanical to believe that across the board lower 
tariffs and by all the 117 countries granting each other MFN 
status (reduced to some extent to a farce by the nations joining 
customs union and free trade areas like the European Community 
and NAFTA) would really lead to a higher volume of world trade 
notwithstanding continued recession, and forecast of global 
slowdown. Similarly naive is the view that countries like India 
would be able to share in this presumed growth on account of 
tariffs lowered by everyone, and thus at least denying us any 
comparative price advantage. One has just to recall the results 
of our past devaluations as also the role of domestic factors 
like fluctuating farm output, slow industrial growth, growing 
import-intensity of our exports, foreign exchange and 
infrastructure constraints, super profitability of domestic 
sales, entry of MNCs in export goods with their penchant for 
selling in the host country, etc., to appreciate the amount of 
make-believe involved in such a reckoning. 
  But undertaking a commitment to lower tariffs and not to 
raise them in future has many other non-trade related grave 
implications. It restricts our domestic fiscal and investment 
policy options in so far as we cannot raise excise duties, 
particularly on traded goods, without disturbing the balance 
between make or buy option. If we did raise excise duties for 
various reasons like curbing inflation, reducing consumption 
inequities, discouraging consumption of non-merit goods, 
financing development, etc., beyond the point disrupting their 
parity with customs duties, it would amount to discrimination 
against domestic production. But by remaining within the range 
prescribed by the GATT- given customs duties, we cripple our 
fiscal and public investment policy. This is how the GATT gnaws 
away at our sovereignty and nationally determined path of 
development. It is on account of such ceilings on excise duties 
implicit in the GATT terms that our business classes are 
plumping for the GATT agreement. 
  Take another serious implication. With the opening of trade 
in farm products and with market pull of OECD countries' higher 
incomes for our exotic food, fruits, flowers and the lure of 
higher profits among our rich and big landlord farmers, our 
scarce land and other farm inputs would get allocated to crops 
other than those which are needed and can be afforded by 
millions of poor Indians. To assume that the foreign exchange 
thus earned could be allotted for importing essential foodgrains 
is an instance of stoneheadedness: the pull of highly skewed 
domestic income distribution rules out any meaningful 
possibility of this kind. 
  The policy predilections manifested in our overwilling 
acceptance of the GATT agreement have to be seen in the context 
of the use of the marginal external economic sector to set the 
tone, terms and tenor of the overall economic policy regime (a 
la internationalisation, marketisation, privatisation, etc.). 
Thus, the sacrifices imposed on us through the GATT are but a 
component of the heavy cost of the reckless, fundamentalist 
drive to implement the structural adjustment programme. Let it 
be remembered that these costs are grossly unjustly distributed 
among our domestic interests and have to be borne for long by 
our future generations as well. Two NRI economists commissioned 
by the Finance Ministry to endorse and endear the liberalisation 
drive must be appreciated for their frank advice that GATT terms 
have to be accepted in order to further the cause of 
liberalisation or what they called, "economic reforms."

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Abraham: "Scrambling for Markets"] </F>
  [Text] Seven years after its acrimonious beginning in the 
Uruguayan seaside resort of Punta del Esta, the Uruguay Round of 
world trade negotiations finally came to a conclusion in Geneva 
with a ceremonial tap of the gavel by General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Director-General Peter Sutherland. 
  The 400-page document that has emerged is the most 
comprehensive, and easily the most controversial, that has ever 
been negotiated under the aegis of GATT. On the surface, the 
negotiations were about the seemingly simple issue of reducing 
barriers to international trade and stimulating global economic 
growth through greater trade. But in practice, they were about a 
frantic scramble for new markets by the world's leading 
economies. The United States, Europe and lately Japan, mired in 
their worst recession for a decade, needed a new round of tariff 
cuts and opening up of export markets to stimulate their 
economies. The Uruguay Round was the instrument through which 
this was to be achieved. 
  Throughout the session, the virtues of free trade and the 
all-round stimulus to growth that would result from trade 
liberalisation were stressed repeatedly. The rich and the poor, 
the developed and the developing, would all benefit from the 
liberalisation of world trade, everyone from the GATT 
Director-General down repeatedly insisted. Studies by 
organisations such as the World Bank and the Organisation for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that showed a 
$217-230 billion increase in global income as a result of the 
Uruguay Round were widely publicised. 
  But there was a big gap between the negotiating strategies 
of 
the big powers and their devotion to free trade. Both the United 
States and the European Community (E.C.) fought like alley cats 
for most of the seven-year period to preserve their own markets 
while opening up the other's. While the theory of comparative 
advantage was meant to provide the economic rationale for the 
benefits that would flow from trade liberalisation, in practice 
the behaviour of the United States and the E.C. was based more 
on mercantilist principles. Both sides did their best to keep 
their own markets closed in areas where they felt they were 
weak, while trying hard to open up the other's markets in areas 
were they felt they were strong. In other words, they were 
extremely keen on exporting more, but reluctant to import more. 
  The question of trade in agriculture, which bedevilled the 
negotiations until the very end, proved a case in point. The 
United States, which is a comparatively more efficient 
agricultural producer than the E.C., was determined to open up 
the protected European market for agricultural products, and 
also ensure reductions in the E.C.'s subsidised farm exports. 
This would ensure U.S. farmers a greater market share in both 
the E.C. and in third countries where a cut in E.C. export 
subsidies would give U.S. products an advantage. The E.C., 
fearing that thousands of its farmers would be forced to leave 
the land, fought back. Eventually, the Europeans were forced to 
yield despite significant opposition from France. 
  However, the U.S. behaviour in the area of textiles was 
quite 
different. Here, under pressure from its powerful textile lobby, 
the United States did whatever it could to keep its market as 
protected as possible. India was one of the prominent victims of 
the tough U.S. line. The U.S. and the E.C. members had 
campaigned to preserve the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) which 
sets quotas on developing country textile exports to these 
countries. The Uruguay Round agreement sets a 10-year transition 
period at the end of which the MFA is to be wound up and the 
trade in textiles freed from quota restrictions. The United 
States had threatened to try and extend the MFA phase-out period 
to 15 years, while India was trying to get the speed at which 
quota restrictions would be lifted quickened. Textiles form a 
quarter of India's manufactured exports, and perhaps the only 
tangible benefit from the round will be an eventual unfettered 
access to developed country markets for Indian textiles. 
  The showdown between India and the United States occurred on 
December 14, the day before the Uruguay Round was completed. The 
U.S. Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, met the Indian 
Ambassador to GATT, B.K. Zutshi, and demanded that India open up 
its textile market to U.S. imports, failing which the United 
States would put in an amendment to the Uruguay Round draft 
slowing the speed at which Indian textiles would be able to 
enter the U.S. market. 
  This was a blatantly unfair demand which went against a 
basic 
GATT principle of not bargaining for concessions within the same 
sector. Thus, in return for opening up its markets to Indian 
textiles, the United States was justified in asking India to 
open up its markets in some other area, such as machine tools or 
electronics. But asking for concessions within the same sector 
is not done, since among other things it goes against the basic 
principle of trade based on comparative advantage. 
  To its credit, the Government of India stood firm. Pakistan 
was the only other country targeted by the United States, and 
both countries presented a united front to the United States and 
the E.C. in a night-long bargaining session that ended at 3 a.m. 
Both India and Pakistan refused to accept any slowing down of 
the speed at which MFA restrictions are lifted. The United 
States finally backed down, perhaps one of the few occasions in 
these negotiations when it did so. 
  As the negotiations came to a close, the developed countries 
made it clear they had got a worse deal than the developing 
countries. In return for vast concessions in areas such as 
services and intellectual property, they felt they had not got 
enough in terms of access for their products into Western 
markets. But it was also clear that the U.S. juggernaut had been 
unstoppable, and that once the United States and the E.C. 
patched up their differences and acted together, there was 
little the rest of the world could do. The long-term impact of 
the Uruguay Round will take a long time to be felt and judged. 
Many of its provisions will only come into effect in five to 10 
years' time and it is only then that one would really be able to 
tell what its effect on the global economy will be. 
  However, it is useful to have an understanding of the main 
provisions: 
  Reduction of industrial tariffs: Participants have 
agreed on an average cut of between 30 and 40 per cent in 
tariffs or the import duties they levy on goods. The world's 
main trading countries have also agreed to scrap import duties 
in a number of areas such as pharmaceuticals, construction 
equipment, furniture, beer, wood, paper and toys. Indian 
exporters of these products to the E.C. and the United States 
should benefit. India has offered a trade-weighted average cut 
of around 50 per cent on its tariffs on raw materials, 
intermediates and capital goods, but no changes in the area of 
consumer goods imports. 
  Services: The Uruguay Round has included services 
for the first time in GATT trade negotiations. It provides for 
the basic GATT principles of most-favoured-nation (MFN) 
treatment, though it also allows exceptions to this rule. Though 
the basic rules of trade in services have been set out, concrete 
market-opening negotiations have met with little success. Thus, 
in areas such as financial services, telecommunications, 
maritime services and the movement of personnel, negotiations 
will continue to determine the level of access to foreign 
markets. In other areas such as construction and tourism there 
has been a fair deal of progress. India is primarily interested 
in getting a good agreement on the movement of personnel, which 
will allow Indian professionals to travel freely to the 
developed world to provide services on a short-term basis. India 
has made offers in the area of construction and value-added 
telecommunications. An offer on financial services was withdrawn 
after the United States decided it was going to adopt a 
"two-tier approach" on financial services. The West was 
interested in getting access to the Indian insurance market, but 
this has not been granted. 
  Agriculture: This is a major area of controversy 
between the United States, the E.C. and several 
agriculture-exporting countries such as Australia and Argentina. 
The agreement is intended to reduce the level of subsidies the 
United States and the E.C. pay to their farmers and also cut 
back on subsidised food exports. The aim is to benefit more 
efficient agriculture producers, including several in the 
developing countries. Under the agreement, certain types of farm 
subsidies are to be reduced by 20 per cent over six years, while 
export subsidies are to be cut by 36 per cent over the same 
period. It also calls for the opening up of a minimum of 3 per 
cent of the domestic market to imports. As for India, its level 
of subsidies is below the 10 per cent cut-off level. As far as 
the import commitment is concerned, the Government plans to take 
recourse to GATT provisions that allow countries with balance of 
payments problems to impose import restrictions. There were also 
potential problems in the text relating to Indian stockpiles of 
food for the public distribution system which have apparently 
been resolved. 
  Intellectual property: For India, this has been 
the most controversial aspect of the Uruguay Round. Intellectual 
property was bulldozed into it by the United States where there 
has been a large outcry about the "piracy of intellectual 
property." Until 1989, India refused to discuss the issue and 
then abruptly changed its stance. Under the current agreement, 
the Indian Patent Act of 1970 will have to be amended to 
introduce product patents for food, chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals. This will involve changes in the way certain 
sections of the Indian pharmaceutical industry operate. Under 
the current patent regime, Indian manufacturers have been free 
to produce drugs patented abroad by using a different process. 
This will change now, and a rise in the prices of certain drugs 
are predicted. It is, however, also useful to note that with 
this change, the Indian patent system reverts to its pre-1970 
status, where products and processes were patented. The Uruguay 
Round agreement will also oblige India to provide intellectual 
property protection to new plant varieties and will make 
microorganisms patentable, two areas which have justifiably 
aroused a great deal of passion. However, the rights of farmers 
and breeders to use and re-use patented seed material is not 
threatened, since governments too have the power the build in 
adequate safeguards.[sentence as printed] 
  Creation of a new trade organisation: A World 
Trade Organisation (WTO) has been created to replace the 
existing GATT Secretariat in Geneva and administer the Uruguay 
Round agreements. In many ways, this is more than 40 years 
overdue. When GATT was signed in 1947, it was intended that an 
International Trade Organisation (ITO) would be created. A 
charter was drawn up, but due to U.S. opposition it never got 
off the ground. The United States finally gave assent to the 
creation of a new organisation. 
  Stronger multilateral trade rules and better dispute 
settlement: One of the gains to countries like India from a 
stronger multilateral organisation could be that unilateral 
trade action by the United States and other giants of world 
trade will be curbed. While Section 301 will remain in the 
United States statute books, it cannot be used in areas which 
come under the Uruguay Round. Any dispute under the Uruguay 
Round agreements will have to go through the multilateral 
dispute settlement procedures. 
  Textiles: Textile and clothing exports into the 
developed countries are restricted by quotas set under the MFA. 
Textile exporters such as India have struggled to get the MFA 
restrictions removed as quickly as possible, but have run into 
stiff opposition from the United States and European textile 
lobbies. The MFA will be wound up in 10 years' time from 1995. 
Its quotas will gradually be lifted over this period, but the 
lifting will be so gradual that its impact will only be felt at 
the end of the 10-year period.

<F P=106> [Article by Sukumar Muralidharan: "GATT: Little to Cheer"] </F>
  [Text] Till not very long ago, it was possible to believe 
that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) impinged 
little, if at all, on the lives of most people. But over a 
period of just seven years, GATT rapidly made the descent from 
the realm of arcane international diplomacy, to the domain of 
popular demonology. From being the preserve of the stodgy 
bureaucrat, GATT became in quick time, the demagogue's dream. 
  But the time for fantasies ran out on December 15. After 
blowing hot and cold for seven years, with the principals now 
engaging one another in negotiations, then breaking off in 
acrimony--117 nations acceded on that day to an omnibus 
agreement that will govern international trade into the 
foreseeable future. The final accord was pushed through merely 
because the major players of the world trade game--the United 
States, the European Union and Japan, principally--knew they 
could not afford the costs of failure. 
  India, as one of the developing countries which are sought 
in 
vain to establish a position in GATT, came out of it with little 
to celebrate. A very qualified victory came its way with the 
commitment by contracting parties to phase out quotas on textile 
exports within 10 years. India also managed to fight off a 
last-breath offensive by the European Union and the United 
States, to open up its markets in textiles to foreign 
manufacturers. That battle was won with a well-argued case and 
neatly-constructed logic--attributes that have over the current 
round of GATT talks won the Indian negotiators high marks. But 
the joint European Union-U.S. offensive was perhaps in the 
nature of a diversionary manoeuvre. Having beaten back this 
attack, India signed on the dotted line without demur--its 
concerns over the long-term consequences of the deal temporarily 
outweighed by relief over a short-term victory. 
  Within India, preparations for accession to GATT had 
proceeded inconspicuously, but with an unmistakable sense of 
purpose. Parliament was in session as the deadline approached. 
And this proved an unavoidable irritant for the Government. 
Though the Government is accorded the unfettered right to accede 
to any international treaty, it perhaps imagined that some 
concessions to parliamentary sentiment would be prudent. 
  As soon as Parliament got down to transacting business in 
the 
current session, a debate on the GATT talks was scheduled. 
Expectedly, Opposition members traversed ground that had already 
been well covered, holding forth on the dangers to the country's 
sovereignty implicit in the GATT treaty. And in an 
all-too-familiar litany, the Government responded with its own 
perceptions--affirming that on balance the Dunkel Draft Text of 
the GATT treaty promised a net gain to the country. 
  Following this, the report of the Standing Committee of 
Parliament attached to the Ministry of Commerce was tabled. In 
an exhaustive document which counselled extreme caution upon the 
Government in accepting certain of the Dunkel proposals, the 
sections that gained publicity were dictated by convenience. The 
Standing Committee had refrained, considering the constitutional 
position, from insisting on any kind of a parliamentary right to 
vet the GATT treaty before the Government took a decision on 
accesion. The constitutional position in this regard is fairly 
clear--the conclusion of international treaties is an executive 
privilege. Parliament has the right of scrutiny, but no power of 
veto or sanction. 
  Secondly, the Standing Committee had observed that on 
balance 
India would be better served by remaining within the 
multilateral framework of rules that GATT imposed. In a package 
so elaborate, it was inevitable that there would be elements not 
quite to the liking of the country. But withdrawal from the GATT 
forum would make the country especially vulnerable to political 
arm-twisting. The U.S. proclivity to extract some political 
concession in return for granting a partner country the Most 
Favoured Nation (MNF) status in trade deals could take a heavy 
toll of the country's room for autonomous action. Remaining 
within GATT ensured at least that the MFN status was granted 
automatically, as matter of right. 
  If these were all that the Standing Committee had said, then 
the Government would have been on a safe wicket in authorising 
the Indian negotiators at GATT to appeal their signatures to the 
deal. But as soon as word had gone out that the Government had 
given its assent, Parliament broke out in a storm of outrage. In 
the ensuing babble, the one phrase that came through with some 
clarity was that the Government had "sold the country out." 
  Eager to limit the damage, Commerce Minister Pranab 
Mukherjee 
made an appearance in Parliament, stoically reading out a 
prepared statement through the din of Opposition voices. The 
Government had made certain commitments to Parliament and the 
people, he said. And these had all been met. There was no going 
back on any of the assurances that the Government had held out 
in relation to the GATT talks, he claimed. Though India's gains 
were not unequivocal, there was no gainsaying that on balance 
the country stood to improve its foreign trade on account of the 
new framework of GATT rules. A few concessions had been made in 
certain areas to ensure concord and cordiality in the 
multilateral trading system. This was no more than the normal 
give-and-take of international negotiations. 
  The Minister's words failed to carry much conviction. The 
provisions of the Dunkel Text are far-reaching and wide. The 
areas in which the country has serious apprehensions--which yet 
remain undispelled--are many. To say that the country can afford 
to yield ground on issues like patents in return for major 
concessions in the area of agriculture, would seem to beg the 
question, as long as the gains in the latter sphere remain 
uncertain and unquantified. 
  The consensus on the Dunkel provisions on agriculture 
appears 
to be that it will not radically hurt Indian price-support 
operations. Member-nations of GATT are expected to make an 
estimate of the aggregate measure of support (AMS) given to 
agriculture--roughly speaking, the AMS would be equivalent to 
the subsidy component as a proportion of the total value of 
output. AMS to the extent of 10 per cent is permissible under 
GATT rules. 
  However, the developed market economies are bound by very 
different compulsions. They are committed under the GATT rules 
only to reducing their export subsidies by a certain 
figure--typically around 20 per cent. Concurrently, the quantum 
of subsidised exports is to be cut by 36 per cent. This still 
leaves the core of the issue of agricultural protectionism 
unresolved. And even if India should hope to gain a share in the 
world market for agricultural products, it should be disabused 
by the stringent sanitary and phyto-sanitary norms imposed under 
the new GATT deal. 
  Pretending that all is well does not help in evolving 
survival strategies to cope with the regime of draconian trade 
controls that the latest GATT treaty imposes. There is little 
gainsaying that the concerns expressed by various responsible 
commentators in the areas of patents in particular, are of 
sufficient moment to warrant serious consideration. And it is 
also a fact that GATT is a loose treaty, which provides ample 
room for fudging. Where the Government is involved in an 
elaborate pretence that all is well, there is little likelihood 
of this room for manoeuvre being exploited. 
  Witnesses before the Select Committee on the Dunkel Text had 
put forth a series of suggestions on how the Government could 
evade some of its most draconian provisions. For one thing, the 
patent regime envisaged seeks to reverse the burden of proof, 
putting on the defendant the onus of proving that he has not 
violated a patent. This reverses one of the fundamental tenets 
of Indian jurisprudence, which puts the burden of proof on the 
plaintiff rather than the defendant. Under the Dunkel Text, a 
product would be assumed to be made by a patented process, 
unless proven otherwise. This is the sense in which the "product 
by process patent" of the Dunkel Text marks a drastic shift from 
the concept of "process patent" which is a fundamental tenet of 
the Indian Patents Act. 
  Certain witnesses appearing before the Select Committee 
observed that if amendments to the Indian patents law were to be 
made in line with this requirement, the result would be 
repugnant to notions of natural justice. Some of them suggested 
that suitable countervailing provisions be built into the 
Evidence Act to check possible abuses of the legal system using 
the reversal of the burden of proof. This would minimise abuses, 
and put the brakes on disruptive litigation. 
  Another requirement of the Dunkel Text, that importation of 
a 
product into a country be deemed equivalent to the working of a 
patent, has understandably created much disquiet. Under the 
Indian Patents Act the public authority is empowered to sanction 
the "compulsory licensing" of production in the case of patents 
that fail to be worked. The Dunkel Text renders the 
circumstances which warrant resort to the compulsory licensing 
provision so restrictive as to virtually do away with this as an 
element of public policy. 
  Concerns have been expressed that without the goad of 
compulsory licensing, patent-holders will capitalise on the 
monopolies that the law confers on them. And in matters of vital 
public interest, as for instance in the drugs and 
pharmaceuticals industry, the implications could be 
disastrous--unaffordable drugs for the mass of consumers, and 
immense private profiteering at the cost of the social good. 
  The solution put forward by various witnesses before the 
Select Committee was that the Monopolies Act should be 
strengthened to deal with such eventualities. This would 
introduce a major qualification to the unfettered right of 
importation enshrined by the Dunkel Text. And while seeming to 
accede to most provisions of the new treaty, India could build 
up sufficient safeguards through sections of the law that are 
not directly covered by the GATT discipline. 
  These are strategies of survival that could dilute the 
thrust 
of the GATT offensive. At a certain stage it is obvious the 
stratagems will be seen through. But GATT is a loose treaty 
which is observed more often in the breach. According to recent 
estimates, no more than half of the total world trade is covered 
by the provisions enshrined in GATT, and India's dependence on 
MFN trade is also of a similar magnitude. GATT provides a 
certain degree of latitude to most participant countries. Some 
like India have been using this latitude with great discretion. 
Others like the United States have been brazen in their resort 
to quantitative import restrictions and coercive trade 
diplomacy--all in violation of GATT norms. 
  The hyperbole about a new dawn for multilateral trade needs 
to be viewed against the actual context of the U.S. behaviour 
over the last two decades or so. When the United States began to 
lose its manufacturing edge, it was the first to impose 
voluntary export restraints (VERs) on competitors such as Japan. 
These restrictions came thick and fast, starting in sectors such 
as steel, and going on later to automobiles and semiconductors. 
As the largest market in the world, the United States was at 
liberty to frame its own rules. And where other countries 
refused to play by these rules, it could resort to the kind of 
coercive diplomacy implicit in provisions such as Super 301 and 
Special 301 of its Trade Act. 
  The basic structural features of the world economy which 
contributed to the U.S. economic woes of the 1980s, remain 
unmitigated. To expect GATT to serve as a panacea is 
unrealistic, especially when the counterpart agreement on 
services trade remains an ambiguous entity. The Dunkel Text adds 
a significant number of new weapons to the U.S.' trade armoury. 
But the United States is likely to be obliged at some stage to 
step beyond the ambit of the Dunkel Text, to force its will upon 
recalcitrant trading partners. 
  Former Foreign Secretary Muchkund Dubey put it very well in 
the course of his deposition before the Select Committee. Asked 
about the future of multilateralism, he answered that the 
concept was always something of a myth. What is emerging in the 
current world scenario, he suggested, is "a hotchpotch of a 
highly qualified multilateralism, discriminatory regionalism, 
and arbitrary bilateralism." 
  Far from benefiting from this kind of a shrewd reading, the 
official Indian response seems so far to be mired in a variety 
of wishful thinking--as with the official prognostication that 
the gains to India from accession to GATT would be of the order 
of $2 billion. That the figure is no more than a fantasy hatched 
by some fevered brain in the Government became apparent when 
Pranab Mukherjee proved unable to defend it at his first press 
conference since the GATT deal was signed. 
  Shortly afterwards, Mukherjee flew out to Brussels to 
initial 
a trade protocol, under which India stands to gain certain 
special concessions in the European market. Official spokesmen 
were initially very unclear about the advantages the agreement 
conferred on India. Some said, unconvincingly, that the protocol 
would give India MFN status, forgetting that accession to GATT 
conferred this status as a matter of routine. Others said the 
protocol would help India expand its trade with the European 
Union under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)--which 
is a special concession granted on a bilateral basis. 
  To mitigate the rigours of the new rules, India perhaps 
needs 
itself to take recourse to the kind of "discriminatory 
regionalism" and "arbitrary bilateralism" that fetched the 
United States rich dividends in the GATT talks. India has so far 
been at the receiving end. Its survival as a viable trading 
nation and economy will now depend upon whether it is able to 
give as well as it gets.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Selling a Surrender"] </F>
  [Text] In the aftermath of the agreement arrived at by 
official negotiators of GATT member-countries in Geneva on 
December 15, 1993, an orchestrated effort is being made to sell 
the GATT deal at the end of the tortuous Uruguay Round which 
commenced more than seven years ago at Punta del Este, as a 
victory for all participating countries. Here at home, the Union 
Government initially sought to dismiss opposition to the 
deal--not only from political parties, but from a wide 
cross-section of people including representatives of farmers, 
agricultural workers, industrial employees, public sector 
officers, and professional economists and analysts--as 
ill-informed and baseless. Subsequently, however, it has been 
forced to take a slightly different and at least somewhat 
defensive tack, conceding that the deal is not altogether in our 
favour, but arguing at the same time that this was the best we 
could do under the circumstances. The domestic votaries of 
globalisation within the framework of the existing world order 
have, of course, been far more vociferous in their support to 
the GATT deal. 
  The entire Uruguay Round of talks has seen a steady erosion 
of the positions of the Third World and an enormous 
strengthening of the hegemony of the big three--the United 
States, the European Union and Japan--over world trade. One by 
one, new areas--services, agriculture, domestic investment 
policies, intellectual property rights--have been brought into 
the agenda of multilateral negotiations, with the clear intent 
of eroding the sovereign space available to the weaker 
member-countries. In this context, the absurd argument of 
symmetry in the loss of sovereign space--that if India loses 
sovereignty in certain areas of economic policy on account of 
the deal, so do the United States, the European Union and 
others--needs to be nailed. Notwithstanding the new GATT 
discipline and dispute settlement procedures--which themselves 
are heavily biased in favour of developed countries--the strong 
countries retain and will no doubt use from time to time their 
bilateral/unilateral options. 
  Even leaving aside the extremely important issue of loss of 
sovereign decision-making space, what is the balance-sheet of 
gains and losses of India? Not a single improvement in terms by 
India could get through. While the U.S. attempt to delay the 
phasing out of the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) by another five 
years has not succeeded, there is little cheer for Indian 
textile exporters in the MFA phase-out calendar which opens up 
slowly to the extent of 49 per cent in the first nine years, and 
contains the somewhat incredible promise of the remaining 
opening up occurring in the tenth year. 
  The other area where substantial gains are being claimed is 
agriculture. The picture that is being painted of India's 
agricultural exports expanding by leaps and bounds on account of 
the reduction in agricultural subsidies in the countries of the 
European Union is vastly exaggerated for at least two reasons. 
First, the final reduction agreed upon in the bargaining between 
the United States and the European Union is hardly significant. 
Secondly, primary commodity exports have faced, for quite a long 
period now, declining terms of trade, and the situation is 
unlikely to change. Thus, even if exports were to increase in 
physical terms, their value increase would be quite limited. 
Further, with the increasing industrialisation of agriculture, 
such modest gains as may be made in agricultural exports are 
likely to be far outweighed by the losses in the ground yielded 
in trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS). 
  What must additionally be noted as far as the implications 
of 
the Dunkel deal for India in the area of agriculture are 
concerned, is the provision of minimum market access. This 
provision requires us to allow agricultural imports to the 
extent, at the minimum, of a certain percentage of domestic 
consumption. This minimum is also slated to rise over time. The 
argument that India can escape this provision by improving the 
precarious balance of payments situation ignores the fact that 
the provisions permitting even a temporary restriction of 
imports on balance of payments grounds have now been 
considerably diluted, and that in any case the IMF will be the 
arbiter. 
  There are several areas in which the GATT deal is extremely 
unfavourable to India. The new IPR regime severely restricts 
access to new scientific and technological knowledge, and is 
thus in sharp contrast to the principles of "free trade" so 
sanctimoniously proclaimed by the West. It is a serious 
impediment to our scientific and technological advance. The 
introduction of product patent, the treatment of import as 
equivalent to working of the patent, the right to patent life 
forms, and the requirement of providing an effective, even if 
sui generis, system of protection to IPR in plant 
varieties--all these have strong negative implications for 
biotechnology and agricultural advance. 
  The new IPR regime will sharply erode the self-reliance of 
our drugs and pharmaceuticals sector and lead to increase in 
prices of various drugs. The argument that most drugs currently 
under use are not under patent ignores two important facts. A 
"low" overall proportion of drugs not under patent is consistent 
with the same proportion being much higher for specific groups, 
and this is indeed the case with respect to such important 
groups as anti-bacterial and anti-cancer drugs. Secondly, in the 
context of the current biotechnology revolution, a lot of new 
drugs will be emerging, and under the Dunkel text these will be 
patented. Further, the claim that, where necessary, the 
government can invoke provisions of compulsory licensing in the 
public interest, is very misleading, since the Dunkel Draft 
provisions on compulsory licensing are very weak. 
  Details apart, what needs to be unambiguously understood is 
that the new GATT treaty violates our sovereignty by seriously 
curtailing the power to decide policies not only in relation to 
foreign trade but in relation to such fundamental areas as 
agriculture, investment, and social welfare. Unfortunately, the 
Government has shown no willingness at all to put up even a 
decent fight, let alone try to evolve a serious negotiating 
stance independently and in conjunction with other developing 
countries. This is, of course, not surprising, given the present 
Government's abject surrender to the diktats of the IMF and the 
World Bank. 
  The bulldozing of the GATT deal symbolises the emerging 
world 
order of the 1990s. In the period immediately after the Second 
World War, the imperial powers, save the United States, had 
suffered a steep decline in political and economic terms; a 
number of countries had embarked on the socialist path; and 
there was a wave of decolonisation. The new institutions, the 
IMF and the World Bank, were created, in the first instance, to 
stabilise the capitalist economic order in its citadels, GATT, 
while part of the same scheme of things, had to make some 
concessions to developing countries, in the context of the Cold 
War, and the presence of a group of socialist countries 
sympathetic to the Third World. For a brief while, in the 1970s, 
developing countries even made bold to assert themselves and 
demand a new international economic order. There has now been a 
sea-change, with the collapse of socialism in eastern Europe and 
the former USSR, and the triumphant centralisation and 
consolidation of international capital under U.S. hegemony. The 
new GATT deal is a milestone on the road to global 
recolonisation and a millstone around our necks. 
  There is still time. The treaty will not be signed until the 
ministerial meet in April 1994. The people of this country can 
still say `no' to recolonisation. The inadmissible alternative 
is rule by transnational corporations and a mockery of people's 
sovereignty and parliamentary democracy.

<F P=106> [Article by Parvathi Menon: "Anger and Despair"] </F>
  [Text] India's decision to sign the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and the Government's subsequent efforts 
to defend the decision as one having been made in the country's 
best interests are viewed as a definite setback for economic and 
political self-reliance by a cross-section of people interviewed 
in Bangalore. 
  In Karnataka, the Dunkel Draft Text (DDT) was being debated 
and aggressively opposed even as awareness of this important 
issue was just beginning to grow in other parts of the country. 
As early as March 1992, nearly 700 scientists from the Indian 
Institute of Science, Bangalore, India's premier research 
institution, signed a letter addressed to the Prime Minister, 
expressing their opposition to the DDT which they felt would 
compromise India's self-reliance in science and technology. 
  The credit for highlighting the impact a Dunkel Draft-based 
agreement would have on Indian agriculture--from the question of 
seed/gene patenting and the rights of cultivators, to the likely 
effects of multinationals' entry into the crucial food 
sector--goes to the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRSS), a 
farmers' organisation led by M.D. Nanjundaswamy. KRSS members 
carried out a daring attack on the Bangalore office of Cargill 
India Ltd, a subsidiary of the U.S. multinational Cargill Inc., 
in January 1993, followed by another attack on the Cargill 
factory in Bellary. These may have drawn a great deal of media 
flak for their "adventurism," but these actions were primarily 
responsible for opening the Dunkel debate to the public and 
indeed forcing the Government--which till then had chosen to 
conceal the import of the GATT negotiations--to come clean and 
explain its negotiating stance to a large and concerned 
constituency. 
  "It is a total surrender of the country's sovereignty by the 
Government of India at a time when the issue was under debate in 
Parliament, and also under examination by the Standing Committee 
on Agriculture headed by Nitish Kumar, which has not yet 
submitted its recommendations. The Government never bothered to 
refer the matter to the State legislatures though many subjects 
covered by the Dunkel Draft come under the State List, such as 
agriculture," says Nanjundaswamy, who dismisses the Government's 
claims of having gained concessions, particularly in the textile 
sector, as empty talk. "The so-called concessions are all at the 
level of oral assurances. There is nothing committed to in black 
and white--including in textiles," he says. He is equally 
dismissive of the Government's promises of protecting the 
farmers' right to retain seeds. "The accused must prove his 
innocence, under the reversal of the burden of proof. The farmer 
will have to prove that he has used his own seed, and not the 
patented seed." 
  The KRSS has filed a writ petition in the Karnataka High 
Court questioning the constitutional validity of the Union 
Government's action in signing the Draft Final Treaty of GATT 
which, it says, affects the basic federal structure of the 
Constitution and damages the citizens' fundamental rights. It 
has pleaded for a writ of mandamus to the Union Government 
directing it: 1. to get the consent of the State legislatures 
before signing the final treaty; 2. to hold a referendum before 
signing the final treaty; and 3. to make a comprehensive 
statement concerning the contents of the final treaty. It has 
also sought a similar writ of mandamus to be issued to the 
President to exercise his power under Article 143 of the 
Constitution (to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for its 
opinion). 
  Nanjundaswamy, who attended an anti-Dunkel meeting of 
representatives of farmers, ecologists and consumer groups in 
Geneva on December 4, says, "Our stand is that India should 
remain a member of GATT, but should have demanded drastic 
amendments in the agreement. India had the opportunity to build 
up a Third World lobby that would have given us stronger 
bargaining power." 
  This is a view shared by others. "My charge against the 
Government is that there was no attempt to take the lead in 
organising Third World countries to take a harder bargaining 
position," says H.D. Deve Gowda, Janata Dal MP and a member of 
the parliamentary committee headed by I.K. Gujral set up to 
examine the Dunkel Draft. "At one stage two years ago, the 
Government actually issued instructions to its negotiators in 
the talks not to mobilise the support of other countries. They 
can't mortgage our independence like this. After all, we are a 
nation of 90 crore people, and can't be bullied by Clinton." 
  Referring to an article by former Foreign Secretary Muchkund 
Dubey, S. Chatterji, a scientist at the Indian Institute of 
Astrophysics, Bangalore, says: "In his article Dubey makes clear 
how suggestions that India call a meeting of non-aligned 
countries to forge common ground on the Dunkel issue was met 
with hostility from the Government. To me, the question of 
whether or not we should have signed it is hypothetical. We 
never tried to find an alternative. We could have stood firm on 
the question of intellectual property rights and could have got 
the support of countries like Argentina and Brazil. They cannot 
impose a so-called uniform multilateral trading order, when the 
global world order is not uniform." 
  There is widespread concern about GATT's adverse impact on 
different sectors of the economy--agriculture, textiles, 
services, and a large, uncharted area where intellectual 
property rights will unfairly restrict growth--but most persons 
admit to not being clear about the exact ramifications of the 
various clauses in the text. Most of the scientists whom 
FRONTLINE spoke to, for example, while careful not to overreact 
on an issue which they all claimed they did not know enough 
about, expressed their reservations about the scope of the 
agreement, particularly its implications for the future of 
Indian science and technology. D. Balasubramaniam, Director of 
the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, drew 
attention to the lack of "public documentation" and the 
Government's failure to ascertain public opinion on such an 
important issue. But his main concern is about India's 
self-reliance in the field of science and technology. "Are we 
closing our gates to ourselves?" This is really what is worrying 
me. Any nation for its well-being must be self-reliant. This 
doesn't mean that it must be self-sufficient in everything, 
although self-sufficiency is a good goal for important areas, 
like food. People seem to forget that technology moves fast, it 
leaps across boundaries. To restrict technological growth is to 
impose an economic burden on an otherwise radiating field. We in 
India are concerned about health care, the use of genes, 
particularly gene therapy. Patents can restrict our access to 
technology. Any nation's long term goal in scientific research 
is that it will lead to a greater amount of awareness and 
prosperity. In an economic crisis, 'luxuries' such as science, 
education and health are hit first. Under GATT it may become 
easier and/or more cost effective to import products from 
outside. But this will certainly lead to the scientific and 
technological aspects of Indian economic development taking a 
back seat." 
  The problem is not merely the use of patents as an 
instrument 
of unfair leverage. The prohibitive costs of international 
patents will also deter even those individuals/research 
establishments that may wish to get into the business of 
patenting, according to H. Sharad Chandra, Professor, Department 
of Molecular and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science. 
"Knowledge of patents in India is woefully lacking," he 
observed. "It has never really been a part of our 
culture--remember the great Mughal artists who would not even 
sign their creations. An American patent costs around Rs. 20 
lakh--out of the question for the ordinary scientist. And one in 
a hundred patents may be accepted. Take the Indian Institute of 
Science. We as an institution may not be able to spend on more 
than two such patents a year. With this reality staring us in 
the face, if the Government wants us to get more competitive, it 
must provide professional investment/patent advice. My feeling 
is that, in the short run, the GATT agreement will make the rich 
richer and the poor poorer." 
  With the monopoly status a patent confers on its holder, 
plus 
the opening up of markets, we will be "moving backwards," 
according to A.V. Rama Rao, Director, Indian Institute of 
Chemical Technology, Hyderabad. "Once you open up, the 
Government has no control. Multinationals have huge marketing 
capabilities. All right, we have signed because all nations have 
done so. But the Government must consider what safeguards it can 
give local producers. We have both manpower and technical 
capabilities." 
  It is in the area of health that the new intellectual 
property regime will perhaps make the most palpable impact. Drug 
prices are predicted to rise steeply. "Yesterday was the saddest 
day in my life," Dr. Y.K. Hameid, managing director of Cipla, an 
Indian owned pharmaceutical company, told FRONTLINE. "By 
accepting the TRIPS part of the Dunkel Draft, we have 
compromised on two crucial areas of the country's 
well-being--food and health. What we have done is to put 
ourselves at the mercy of multinationals. The impact on drug 
prices will be felt in the next five to 10 years. Ultimately our 
companies will be forced to sell out." Cipla is the fourth 
largest pharmaceutical company in India, with an expected 
turnover of Rs. 250 crore in 1994. It exports bulk drugs and 
formulations to Europe, America and other countries. 
  "Articles 27 and 28 of the Dunkel Text will allow the patent 
holder both to produce and import. MNCs prefer to import rather 
than produce locally, and they do not allow their local units to 
export to overseas markets. What guarantees have we obtained 
against such practices?" asks B.K. Chandrashekhar, Professor, 
Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, and co-editor of the 
book, The Dunkel Draft: Design for Disaster 
(Navakarnataka Publications, Bangalore). 
  The contradictory statements made by the Government and its 
attempt to obfuscate an already confusing document, which, as 
Balasubrananiam says, "binds our national endeavours not in 
terms of global trade but in terms of global restrictions," has 
been criticised sharply. Chandrashekhar says: "First Pranab 
Mukherjee says farmers' interests will be protected. The next 
minute he says farmers must pay a one-time royalty for seeds. It 
is not clear whether exchange of seeds will be a part of the 
sui generis form of protection for seeds as required 
by GATT. And what are the actual provisions in the sui 
generis system that will be offered as an alternative to 
patents?" 
  But, despite the pessimism the GATT agreement has generated, 
there is the stated confidence that a nation of India's size and 
capabilities cannot be browbeaten. As one commentator observed, 
"After all, the GATT agreement is not the Indian Constitution, 
and if its implementability becomes a serious problem, there 
will be a demand for changes in the agreement by political and 
economic forces in the country."

<F P=106> [Article by Ujjwal Chowdhury: "Farmers Trading Places"] </F>
  [Text] It will come as a surprise to many to hear a 
sizeable group of Indian farmers not only applaud economic 
liberalisation but even have fond thoughts regarding the Dunkel 
draft. On October 31 this year at Aurangabad, Indian peasant 
leaders from six states under the leadership of Mr Sharad Joshi, 
of Shetkari Sangathana fame, took a major step towards putting 
together a united farm lobby in favour of economic 
liberalisation. A national level Kisan Coordination Committee 
was formed to pool the resources of farmers who support all out 
liberalisation, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and 
the Dunkel proposals. 
  An earlier attempt to form such a union fell apart after 
farmer leaders fell out with each other during the Delhi Boat 
Club rally in October last year. Against this backdrop the birth 
of a revamped KCC assumes added significance. The new committee 
includes Mr Bipin Bhai Desai of Gujarat, Mr Sharad Joshi and Mr 
Pasha Patel, both of the Shetkari Sangathana, Mr S.P. Sharkara 
Reddy, president of the Andhra Ryotu Sangam, Mr Bhupinder Singh 
Mann, member of parliament and Mr Harpal Singh, president of the 
Bharatiya Kisan Union (Harpal faction) of Uttar Pradesh, and a 
couple of other leaders on its executive council. 
  The KCC has delineated a platform that positions itself 
carefully in the present ideological debate within India's 
farming community. It has endorsed the resolutions adopted at 
the fifth convention of the Shetkari Sangathana in October. It 
also drew up a list of demands and planned a programme of 
agitations. Provided the KCC mobilises even one million of 
farmers in this country, 1994 will witness a gruelling contest 
for peasant leadership. The KCC will represent one point of 
view. It will be battling it out with Mr Mahendra Singh Tikait, 
Mr R. Nanjundswamy, president of the Karnataka Raja Ryota 
Sangha, and other leftist leaders. 
  Though opposition to the Dunkel draft and attacks on 
multinationals like Cargill by some farmers have received wide 
publicity, the KCC represents widespread antagonism among 
farmers to the statist Nehruvian model under which they have 
suffered for 45 years. A major source of disgruntlement is the 
belief they have for years been forced to sell their crops at 
below market rates under this model. 
  Echoing the stand the Shetkari Sangathana, the KCC's main 
grievance is that the government has done little about lifting 
restrictions in agriculture other than to produce considerable 
rhetoric. Mr Mann and Mr Desai are particularly harsh about the 
fact that monopoly purchasing systems, zonal restrictions, 
barriers to the self-processing of agricultural produce and 
export restrictions will remain. 
  They point to the government's accepting of "dumped" 
products 
from abroad. They complain that three million tonnes of wheat 
was imported last year from North America and Australia to fill 
up the public distribution system when farmers from Punjab 
boycotted government purchasing. Farmer representatives contend 
the government was refusing to pay them Rs 300 per quintal while 
it paid over Rs 525 for the imported wheat. 
  The KCC argue the Indian farmer is internationally 
competitive. Under the Dunkel draft proposals, they argue, there 
will be a curbing of subsidies for European and United States 
farmers. Coupled with the lifting of the Indian government's 
restrictions this will allow the more cheaply produced 
vegetables, fruits and even grains of India to capture markets 
the world over. 
  It also believes that in a totally open global agrarian 
economy Indian farmers and other primary producers who have the 
benefits of relatively low cost methods of production can 
outsell the "modern" farmers of Europe and North America. The 
latter they argue have become slaves to an agricultural system 
of government subsidies and energy intensive chemicals and 
industrial inputs. 
  The KCC has endorsed the "fourfold" agricultural policy 
envisaged by the Shetkari Sangathana. The key elements to this 
manifesto include agricultural exports, the establishment of 
shops to build direct links with consumers of agricultural 
produce, the direct home processing of such produce, and 
experimental agriculture which seeks to minimise the costs of 
chemical fertilisers and other inputs. 
  Pro-Dunkel farmers groups are organisationally far weaker 
than those standing for swadeshi and restrictions on 
multinationals. Except for Maharashtra and Punjab, they do not 
have a significant presence in most states, irrespective of the 
claims of the leaders. However if the KCC sticks to some popular 
demands--like raising the government's procurement prices--their 
support base may expand in the long run. 
  The KCC also voices the popular view that in the name of 
ending subsidies, the rates for electricity, water and so on 
were being unreasonably increased. But there was no effort to 
improve these services. It suggests that administrative 
expenditure should be slashed through the introduction of a 
fixed tenure system, stopping all further recruitments and 
freezing the scales of salaries and allowances. 
  The KCC in principle also supports the abolition of 
subsidies 
and the provision of only commercial loans by banks for farmers. 
For obvious reasons however the organisation is not pushing 
these points of view too loudly when it speaks to ordinary 
farmers. 
  The KCC main challenge will be to ably answer the criticisms 
of the Dunkel proposals and liberalisation put forth by other 
farmers' leaders. Mr Nanjundaswamy, for example, argues that the 
proposed Dunkel patenting of agricultural products and processes 
will deprive third world research and development and poses 
ethical questions regarding the ownership of biodiversity. 
  After making the Indian peasantry dependent on subsidies, 
quotas, chemical fertilisers and high yielding seeds promoted by 
the West, the sudden withdrawal of all these under 
liberalisation may cripple the Indian farmer rather than teach 
him to stand on his own. This is something else the KCC needs to 
give some thought to. 
  The leftist farmer groups are critical of the KCC's 
opposition to radical land redistribution and the strong support 
it receives from the rich farmer class. The KCC needs to respond 
to these questions before Indian farmers will lend their full 
support to Dunkel.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Take GATT"] </F>
  [Text] The version of the Dunkel draft that the European 
Union and the United States have agreed upon will for all 
practical purposes be the final treaty the director general of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Peter Sutherland, 
will present to the rest of the world. International trade is a 
fearsomely technical subject. This may be why the P.V. Narasimha 
Rao government seems to have believed GATT could be quietly 
slipped through Parliament without fuss. Given the Dunkel draft 
touches on such emotive subjects as medicine, seeds and textiles 
this was a remarkable bit of wishful thinking on the part of 
South Block. The consequences of this attempt to avoid debate 
has been an intellectual vacuum now filled by emotional rhetoric 
and irrational fears. Much of the scaremongering about GATT by 
leftwing critics is wholly unfounded, particularly the claims 
regarding seed patents. Thanks to official silence about what 
GATT will really mean it is the bogeys that have come to 
dominate the popular vision of the Dunkel draft. 
  It is necessary India sign on the dotted line in Geneva next 
April. Among other things it is essential to the survival of 
economic liberalisation. Leftists who believe India should 
strike out on its own echo the hoary economic xenophobia that 
has given India over 40 years of splendid stagnation. Any 
international agreement impinges on a country's sovereignty. The 
question is what benefits will accrue to India from signing the 
GATT treaty. Because India is only marginally plugged into the 
world economy it will initially gain little and lose less 
because of GATT. However the world's largest trade treaty opens 
many doors. A nation with intelligence and perspicacity can 
benefit hugely. China alone is expected to reap some $40 billion 
in exports over the next decade. There is no reason India cannot 
drink from the same trough. It needs only to put its own 
economic house in order and be less fearful of the outside world. 
  India's long isolation from the global economy has meant 
trade is still looked upon as something akin to colonialism. 
From Adam Smith onwards it has been shown that the exchange of 
goods and services between nations is a two way street, mutually 
beneficial. Victorian England and the US enhanced rather than 
diluted their national standing by being merchants to the world. 
Burma is the dingy example of a trade me not. What makes GATT 
important to a nation still finding its export feet is that it 
provides regulations, ensures a modicum of fair play and allows 
for independent adjudication in case of disputes. Outside GATT 
is a wild and woolly realm of unilateral sanctions and embargos. 
The West holds all the cards in the latter scenario. China, for 
example, accepted a patent regime much stricter than that 
present in the Dunkel draft because it negotiated a bilateral 
agreement with the US. The two sides were so mismatched Beijing 
left with its "sovereignty" in a sling. India needs to 
comprehend globalisation is not a mantra that will change 
reality by mere repetition. It requires a commitment to meet 
the standards and norms of a world that has raced far ahead. 
Catching up requires hard work, not histrionics.

<F P=106> [Article by Pramit Pal Chaudhuri: "Draft Dodging Is Harmful"] </F>
  [Text] Listening to the present debate in India regarding 
the Dunkel draft is like reading the lyrics to "Lucy in the Sky 
with Diamonds." There is a distinctly unreal air about it. It is 
more than the sight of the world's economic superpowers battling 
it out in Geneva, oblivious to the Luddite squeakings of Mr 
George Fernandes and his ilk. It is the manner in which domestic 
critics of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade seem blind to two glaring fallacies in their arguments. 
  The first is the curious illusion India can afford to turn 
its nose up at GATT and thus world trade. 
  The second is the insistent wail that the Dunkel draft is 
grossly slanted against India. Accepting GATT is to sell the 
country's soul, seeds and sovereignty for a few boatloads of 
fabric. This is a farcical misconception that looks only to 
India's concessions and none of its gains. 
  GATT negotiations are about politics. As in all forms of 
international diplomacy there is a certain amount of give and 
take. If India is to judge whether GATT was a success it must 
ask how much it could have influenced events and then consider 
how much it accomplished. By this measure it can be said India, 
far from being sold a mickey, came out of it all reasonably well. 
  The thing to understand is just how much India needs GATT. 
India needs to trade. The days of Nehruvian isolationism are 
over. It cannot withdraw into a protectionist shell, consoling 
itself with the thought Bangladesh is worse off. In very crude 
terms India needs to trade because it needs foreign exchange. It 
needs dollars and pounds to pay off its mammoth foreign debts 
and because it imports most of the petroleum that fuels its 
economy. 
  Trade is also the best means to make an economy grow. As any 
number of boffins will tell you, nations like India that have 
been introverted about trade average three per cent growth. 
Economies that have looked outward double, sometimes triple, 
that rate. 
  No better example exists than China. In its Maoist cocoon it 
seemed destined to be the biggest poorhouse in the world. As a 
Dengist butterfly it is slated to overtake the United States in 
25 years. China is not a GATT member but that is not for want of 
trying. Beijing has incorporated most of Dunkel in its laws. 
Only a spat with the US keeps its membership pending. 
  India has no alternative to trade. But trade can be like 
Darwinian evolution, red in tooth and claw. An export-import 
free for all is a boxing arena where bantamweights battle it 
out with heavyweights. Obviously the former--in global trade 
this means the third world--will be soundly bloodied. 
  This is why GATT is important. For all its faults it is the 
closest thing to a set of Queensbury rules that world trade has. 
During the negotiations a developing nation that used wiliness 
to compensate for its lack of economic clout could save its skin 
and its markets. Outside GATT or in a world without Dunkel, 
India would have to fight multifront trade wars. Think of "Super 
301," double its fangs and put it in the law book of every 
country in the world. Then talk of a neo-colonialist nightmare. 
  The question is whether India was wily enough in GATT. Keep 
in mind India is a trade pygmy, smaller than Singapore. It has 
no weight to throw around. The only other way to win friends and 
influence people in Geneva is to be part of a like minded bloc 
of nations. Hence the plethora of GATT clubs from the upstart 
Cairns Group to the bewhiskered European Union. Try to think of 
an economic grouping that includes India on its roster. New 
Delhi boasts of two. One is the Group of Fifteen dinosaur. The 
other is the South Asia Preferential Trade Agreement where 
India's influence is augmented by Bhutan's. 
  To put it in a cargohold, India went to Geneva in a 
wheelchair and dealt with titans. They should have walked all 
over India. But they did not. Consider how the country fared in 
some areas it had a special interest. 
  The most controversial one, the source of many decibels from 
the Lok Sabha's leftist fringe, is patents. There is a 
completely specious claim GATT will mean every seen planted in 
India will mean paying the multinational. Only the selling of 
seeds on a commercial basis is restricted and even there India 
can fudge the laws. Incidentally the Indian Council of 
Agricultural Research expects to make a killing thanks to Dunkel 
by peddling its own hybrids around the world. 
  India had virtually met Dunkel's requirements long before. 
Of 
GATT's seven intellectual property right areas, Indian law was 
in consonance with six. The one area of difference was 
patents--on seeds and drugs. In drugs India has secured the 
enormous loophole of being allowed to produce any medicine in 
the "public interest." And hang who holds the patent. 
  India can say it was shortchanged over textiles. Textile 
exports are outside GATT, governed by a quota based Multifibre 
Agreement. Asian textile exporters have been clamouring for MFA 
to be scrapped and absorbed into GATT. The US and the EU 
[European Union], fearful their millions of textile workers will 
end up on the dole, have refused to accelerate MFA's 10 year 
phase out period. 
  But again to renounce GATT is foolish. Under Dunkel the 
MFA's 
death is guaranteed. If India refuses to sign GATT its textiles 
will face pre-GATT tariffs of 50 per cent or more. Other textile 
exporters will bask in the three per cent tariff average GATT 
promises by AD 2000. 
  India, and Asia in general, can also complain about the 
failure to tighten GATT's anti-dumping rules. The West has made 
an art of abusing such rules to tie up Asian exporters in 
lengthy litigation before GATT. Asia can gripe about the hefty 
two year safety margin the US and EU have awarded themselves 
against foreign financial institutions. Though given India's 
decrepit financial sector New Delhi is probably quite happy it 
can cite this precedent to give itself a buffer period. 
  India has gained elsewhere. A gem of an opportunity lies in 
GATT's agricultural clauses. Much ado has been made of the 
requirement all nations must cut subsidies to farmers and how 
this will pauperise the Indian farmer. 
  Here is the real story. One, India has to cut subsidies 
anyway if it hopes to reduce its deficit. Two, it is forgotten 
the most generous farm subsidies in the world are dished out by 
the West's governments. Partly because of these subsidies third 
world farmers have never been able to sell their produce to the 
West. Thanks to the Uruguay round the agricultural markets of 
Europe and North America have been pried open for Indian 
exports. Potentially this is a windfall of cyclonic proportions. 
It is why far seeing Indian farm leaders like Mr Sharad Joshi 
worship before the shrine of Dunkel. 
  There is and will be much about India hoodwinked, mugged and 
left to multinational rape. The record says otherwise. It is 
definite GATT will knock some companies off their perches, put 
people out of their jobs. Every country will suffer. Japan and 
South Korea are glumly expecting millions of their farmers to be 
turfed out. But they look at the $250 billion it is 
conservatively estimated GATT will add to the world economy in 
its first year alone and figure it is worth it. Insulated India 
will suffer less social dislocation than them. 
  Even the US and the EU did not have their way in everything. 
The mighty US, card carrying member of two trade blocs and world 
leader in all export sectors, bowed to demands for "compulsory 
licensing" of drugs in the public interest. India banded 
together with Brussels to pull this coup off. 
  It is not necessarily true GATT was full of North 
browbeating 
South. When India asked for revisions in the clauses in 
September it was a group of 38 third world brethren who scuttled 
the effort. 
  When Mr Pranab Mukherjee tells the Lok Sabha India has "no 
alternative" he is for once speaking like a boy scout. Without 
the Uruguay round the United Nations calculates the third world 
loses 20 per cent of its markets in seven years. Without Dunkel 
the rich nations would be unrestrainably greedy. They would 
simply kick the South into accepting the most disadvantageous 
terms possible. The GATT tribunals would not be able to serve as 
courts of appeal. 
  This would be as nothing if the world signed GATT and India 
refused. This would be putting a noose around the neck of the 
nation. Indian tea and jewellery would face tariffs 10 times 
those of the Sri Lankan tea or Thai jewellery. After a few years 
the words "made in India" would fade from international memory. 
Do not denounce GATT. Instead be thankful the Uruguay round has 
at last been squared. 
  Let Mr Manmohan Singh play the card of liberalisation well 
and in the next GATT round the world will await a trade 
agreement among China, Japan and India in the same manner it 
looked to Washington and Brussels this week.

<F P=106> [Article by Dipankar Bhattacharya: "Knocking at the Pearly </F>
GATT"] 
  [Text] It has taken seven years and quite a bit of high 
drama towards the end, but the Uruguay rond of the Geneva 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has now a solution in sight. 
Probably not as general as Mr Peter Sutherland would have 
wished, the agreement nevertheless has brought the world 
remarkably close to becoming a single market. 
  Not all wrinkles have been ironed out. Entertainment still 
eludes a negotiated settlement. So do intellectual property 
rights. Resentment lingers over proposals to phase out subsidies 
on agriculture and civil aviation. Financial services have been 
grudgingly admitted into local markets. There is talk of a 
general agreement on trade in services to take up what the 
Uruguay Round has left unfinished. 
  Yet there can be no denying the current round's achievement. 
GATT proposes to slash tariffs by an average of one third and 
reduce non-tariff barriers--quotas, subsidies, taxes--with the 
ultimate goal of fuelling global economic expansion. By some 
estimates to the tune of at least $200 billion annually by the 
year 2002. 
  The European Union, China and Japan are slated to be the 
biggest gainers. The rest of Asia, which gets the smallest piece 
of the enlarged world trade pie, is expected to net an 
additional $10 billion annually by 2002. India, whose exports in 
1992-93 accounted for 0.4 per cent of global exports, too is 
hoping for a $200 million gain annually. 
  Which is what the third world, having watched the 
Airbus-Boeing battles from the sidelines, can hope to extract 
out of a comprehensive agreement on multilateral trade. GATT 
offers the third world between 15 and 20 per cent of the 
increased world trade. Far more than it can expect by way of 
loans, aid and capital transfers. 
  But all of this is on paper. GATT has merely opened up the 
possibilities. Whether they are transformed into real gains is 
solely dependent on member nations. In the expanded world trade 
as the GATT envisages, there will be some winners and some 
losers. Apart from protection, members are left to their own to 
devise favourable trade balances. 
  While India may be insignificant in the trading world, trade 
is by no means insignificant for India. Its $18.42 billion 
exports constituted 7.6 per cent of its gross domestic product 
in 1992-93, and its $21.73 billion imports, 9 per cent of the 
GDP. However, an increase in the volume of trade by $200 million 
annually does not mean much unless it goes towards improving 
India's trade balance. 
  So when Mr Pranab Mukherjee assures a baying Opposition that 
India's share of the increased action would be in the region of 
$200 million, nothing is actually being said. There is no 
attempt to explain how India expects to climb out of its 
consistent trade deficit. Since 1950, the country has had trade 
surpluses in only two years. And trade models have very little 
to offer by way of optimism for Indian exports. 
  The GATT edifice is built around Ricardian comparative 
advantage. The "I make gin you make rum and we trade" principle. 
Comparative advantage would imply that India exports labour 
intensive goods and services to buy capital intensive imports. 
But while India has an overabundant labour supply there is very 
little evidence that it is cheap. Low productivity, a narrow 
skill base and government induced wage distortions makes Indian 
labour a costly proposition. 
  Since capital too is scarce, the Indian trade experience 
falls into that arcane extreme of theory--that of absolute 
advantage. India has an absolute disadvantage in labour, as well 
as capital intensive exports. Forty years of trade deficits bear 
this out. With absolute disadvantage, a country has little 
reason to trade. 
  But this is without taking technology into consideration. As 
a theory, factor intensive comparative advantage is constrained 
by a set of extremely restrictive assumptions. Benefit to 
trading partners accrues if technologies are assumed identical 
and static, there are no economies of scale and products and 
factors are undifferentiated. 
  The real world is not so rarefied. Expansions of Exxon and 
Mitsubishi contradict the economies of scale assumption. And 
growth rates of the Asian tigers shows how futile it would be to 
ignore technology in a trade model. 
  Efforts have been made to incorporate technological dynamics 
into trade theory. The techno-economic models are based on the 
mushrooming of sunrise industries in the Pacific Rim. But 
Nehruvian isolation kept India blissfully unaware of last 
decade's information revolution. The share of new technology 
imports in India's total import bill is now around 64 per cent. 
This ratio is increasing. Only 19 per cent of Indian exports are 
in these areas, that too in the lower market segments such as 
software programming and computer peripherals. 
  With economic restructuring exports may have picked up, but 
India still has a long way to go before trade begins to propel 
growth of the economy. It is a reflection on the general 
ignorance about the country's trade prospects that Indian 
opposition to GATT centres around emotive clauses where we have 
in fact extracted considerable mileage, in seed and drug 
patenting, for instance. 
  Despite India's trade prospects, GATT offers more to India 
in 
terms of capital flows than it could expect through aid, loans 
or investment. As such, trade earnings are the least tied up 
source of foreign exchange. However, GATT imposes pressure on 
the reform process. Balance of payments considerations in a 
freer world trade regime are likely to hasten the government's 
move to free exchange and interest rates. And global competition 
will force the government's hand on the exit policy. 
  This is another area where the Opposition has failed to make 
hay. To other countries, GATT has revolved around jobs, jobs and 
jobs. But employment ramifications of freer trade seem to have 
been lost on the Indian politician. Admittedly, GATT phases out 
trade barriers over 10 years, but at the end of it there is 
going to be an immense global displacement of labour. 
  Freetrade is not only about free movement of products. 
Factors of production, labour and capital, must also be free to 
move across national borders. Through GATT, the North has, in a 
way, legalised the mobility of capital, but there is little in 
the Uruguay round's agreement to enhance labour mobility. 
  The United States, to a certain extent, introduced the issue 
of labour mobility by bringing services into GATT's ambit in 
1986. But an ideal free trade agreement should make it as easy 
for a Filipino to work in a Pittsburg Steel plant as it would be 
for a London lawyer to offer his services to an Egyptian bank. 
  But the process is not easy. Labour is typically more 
encumbered than capital and labour mobility is not an issue for 
economists alone. Social, political, cultural and racial 
considerations have a large role to play in determining 
immigration levels. No infringement of these interests is likely 
to be tolerated for the sake of economic efficiency. 
  In this respect, GATT still has a long way to go. Till then, 
85 per cent of the world's population will have to be content 
with 15 per cent of the gains from multinational trade 
agreements. For the third world to increase its bargaining power 
in subsequent trade negotiations, their markets will have to 
become indispensable to developed nations. To the extent that 
GATT has initiated the opening up of markets, its achievement is 
salutary.

<F P=106> [Article by Anjan Roy: "Little Brother Does Get a Share"] </F>
  [Text] The ruckus in Parliament this week over India 
acceding to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT) 
treaty (the Dunkel final draft) can be understood only in terms 
of political parties adopting positions of tactical advantage. 
They could not have meant it, after all. 
  For, it is difficult to believe that those who are aware of 
the mores of international trade could seriously oppose the 
decision. India accounts for less than 0.6 per cent of current 
international trade, whereas the European Community and the US 
share 40 per cent of world trade. Had India abstained, it would 
have made little difference to the proceedings, except that the 
marginal gains it has made would not have been available either. 
In fact, staying out of the GATT negotiations would have created 
many other problems for India. 
  For example, it would have meant India's withdrawal from the 
economic mainstream of today's world which was not feasible as 
it does not have the capacity to withstand such isolation. Thus, 
joining the negotiations and trying to wrest the maximum 
advantage out of it was the most sensible step on India's part. 
  The biggest advantage of acceding to the GATT treaty is that 
a multilateral trading organisation (MTO) has at last been 
formed to conduct international trade. In the absence of such a 
framework, trade would have to be conducted bilaterally between 
two countries in which the junle [as printed] law of "might is 
right" would inevitably prevail. Trade can now be conducted on 
the basis of well-defined rules which have to be followed by 
both strong and weak trading partners. A rule-based system is by 
and large predictable and this should stabilise international 
trading. 
  So far, so good. However, while arriving at these broad 
parameters, certain interests have been sacrificed which many 
believe smacks of colonialism. The two biggest economic powers 
in the world, the US and the EC, have virtually dictated terms. 
The weakest economic entities, namely the developing world, have 
had to concede the most. 
  This was painfully apparent in the penultimate stages of the 
Uruguay Round of negotiations. Till the very last moment, the 
fate of the talks was uncertain because the US and the EC could 
not agree on some point. But once the two Big Brothers hammered 
out a solution, the agreement was pronounced complete 
irrespective of any remaining differences. 
  The US and the EC have even humbled the economic giant 
Japan, 
and forced it to concede to a series of their demands. The 
country had to capitulate on the highly emotional issue of rice 
imports. Again, Argentina had to agree to a kind of market 
sharing arrangement for its principal exports, which are all 
agrarian products like wheat and beef. 
  In its present form, the completed round provides some 
relief 
to India. The agreement stipulates the phasing out of the 
Multi-fibres Agreement (MFA) and quotas for the export of 
textile items to the developed world. This should take care of 
India's interests to some extent. However, till the last moment, 
the US had tried to stall the phasing out of the MFA and wanted 
the period to be extended from 10 to 15 years. 
  As for the provisions of phasing out agricultural subsidies 
and continuation of a subsidised public food distribution 
system, fortunately, the levels of subsidies in the western 
economies are so high that ours are just a fraction of theirs. 
Hence, there should be no compulsion to lower farm subsidies 
just to accede to the Dunkel draft. 
  India, of course, would have to abide by the stricter codes 
of the agreement for the protection of patents and trade-related 
intellectual property rights. No doubt, these would affect some 
sectoral activities in India, like sections of the Indian drugs 
industry. However, even in a worst case scenario, the impact 
would be minimal. In the broader interests of the country, it 
might be better to honour the intellectual property rights 
because Indian entities could soon have some claims on them. 
  With the GATT accord taking final shape, what remains to be 
seen is the fine print of the agreement and the way it is 
implemented. For the ultimate test will be how "fairly" the 
agreement is adhered to.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hooked on Silence"] </F>
  [Text] Pathetically underinformed Congress members are not 
the only victims of the government's "ask me not" attitude over 
the effects of a concluded Uruguay round on India. Serious 
public misconception is another. And in no case is the 
information gap more severe and the reaction more spontaneous 
than in pharmaceuticals. The popular horror story is of product 
patents in the pharmaceutical sector engendering monopolies and, 
thus, higher prices. Such an outcome, if possible, is obviously 
undesirable for a country as poor as India. The story, however, 
is rather fanciful. Roughly eight drugs are relevant in this 
context--Rifampicin, Bromhexine, Captropril, Salbutamol, 
Norfloxacin, Mebendazole, Ranitidine and Naproxen. Patents for 
only three, Captropril, Ranitidine and Norfloxacin, have not 
expired yet. The other five, due to expiry of their patents, are 
now classified as generic products. The three drugs for which 
patents are still valid will become generic products before the 
ten year adjustment period in the Dunkel draft for changing 
patent legislation is over. Of course, this does not cover the 
new products that will inevitably make their appearance. Product 
patents will apply to them. But to automatically conclude this 
would lead to higher prices is erroneous. Substitutes for the 
therapeutic equivalents of the eight drugs are available, 
without any great difficulty and not at extraordinary prices. 
These drugs presently constitute the essentials in 
pharmaceutical markets. It is extremely unlikely that this 
position will be radically changed. In that case new products, 
being new therapeutic equivalents of the eight drugs will be 
patented no doubt, but by virtue of the existence of substitutes 
will not be produced as monopolistic commodities. The spectre of 
unaffordable prices, foreign companies making hay while the 
majority of Indians suffer under the new patent regime is thus 
at best overimaginative. 
  And of course the government is to be blamed squarely for 
not 
making that clear. This is not merely a public relations 
disaster. It is unpardonable callousness given the multilateral 
trade treaty impinges on several fronts. That Parliament and the 
people were so ill informed about the nation's most important 
international economic agreement is however not surprising. A 
similar combination of ignorance of the norms of public debate 
in a democracy and inability or unwillingness to put forward its 
case when it has an excellent one is evident in the case of 
economic reforms. India's brave attempt to change its economic 
course is being conducted amidst ridiculous official 
taciturnity. Parliamentary debate as a result, as in the case of 
the Dunkel draft discussions, has rarely risen above partisan 
rhetoric. And even in that, the Congress members have been 
uncomfortable cheerleaders for reform, all the talk about 
ushering in change lacking the solidity that comes from a 
forthcoming and confidently articulate government. The 
Opposition, naturally, has had considerable success in tarring 
reform with virtually any brush it has chosen to--anti-poor, 
pro-exploitative international capital, means to selling the 
nation's economic sovereignty. Part of the problem is in the 
fact the Congress lacks a "great communicator." The prime 
minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, has comfortably proved his 
disadvantage in this field, and other senior party leaders are, 
when economically literate, not charismatic and when charismatic 
not capable of explaining "the new economic policies." But 
governments can get messages across even without persuasive 
communicators. The vast propaganda machine at their command 
doing the job. A number of Latin American nations have done 
exactly that. That India has not simply reflects how shoddy its 
standards and visions of governance are.

<F P=106> [Article by Pramit Pal Chaudhuri: "GATT's Lack of Moral </F>
Fibre"] 
  [Text] The Uruguay round of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade has expanded world free trade. But one area 
where the Dunkel draft failed was textiles. Specifically it 
failed to put the slow death of the Multifibre Arrangement on 
the fast track. This was a triumph of Northern vested interest 
politics over economic sense and Southern demands. 
  The MFA was a protectionist intruder in GATT. Put together 
in 
1973 the MFA was supposed to provide a temporary breathing space 
for a Western textile industry about to be inundated by a flood 
of Third World imports. But it was renewed repeatedly. One of 
the main points of the Dunkel draft was to kill the MFA by 
incorporating textiles into GATT. That absorption would mean the 
textile trade would be hampered only by low tariff barriers 
rather than the MFA's arbitrary and restrictive quota system. 
  The key question was the schedule under which MFA would be 
withdrawn--how long would the entire process take and what 
percentage of textiles would be shifted from MFA to GATT during 
each phase. Third World exporters like India and Pakistan went 
to GATT urging the phase-out period end in 1997. The US domestic 
textile industry preferred AD 2008. The European Union wanted 
2001. In the end the Western nations negotiated among themselves 
and came up with 2003. 
  In addition, they were able to force a three-year 
"transition" period on top of this making the MFA's actual death 
date 2006. The South was forced to swallow this bitter pill. 
  Equally unbalanced was the percentage of textiles affected 
during each of the three phases. The third world had wanted 20 
per cent in the first phase, 25 in the second and 30 in the 
last--over 10 years. Instead the GATT treaty provides 16, 17 and 
18 per cent. This means that all the way until 2006, at least 49 
per cent of textile exports will be governed by nation-by-nation 
quotas. Again there was little choice. 
  The Asian cloth kings have grumbled loudly at this act of 
hypocrisy by a West that preaches the benefits of a free market 
to them. But threatening the US with homemade versions of Super 
301 would be the subject of good comedy, not good economic 
policy. India accomplished none of its set goals, in particular 
an accelerated phase-out schedule. Much of the supposed 
"successes" New Delhi is touting such as an increased US textile 
import quota are little more than token sops. 
  However, it is right when it says granting market access to 
US textile exports will have no impact on India's domestic 
industry. The US has had such access under the 1992-97 Indian 
import policy, but sold almost nothing. Its makers cannot 
compete with India's except in brand name designer labels like 
"Arrow" or "Lacoste." 
  In addition, Mr Bill Clinton had made a Faustian pact with 
US 
domestic textile makers. In order to get the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) through Congress, he promised them that 
demands for a fore-shortening of the MFA's lifespan would be 
resisted. Though he failed to get 15 years he was able to get 
13, which was almost as good. He quite ignored the fact that the 
MFA by 1986 alone was estimated to have cost the US consumer $40 
billion through artificially high prices. 
  One reason the North had its way was the complete inability 
of the South to put up a united front. Sri Lanka, for example, 
preferred the MFA because its quota system guaranteed it 
exports. Under a free trade GATT regime it would have to compete 
with more efficient producers like India. 
  The unspoken truth, US and Indian industry analysts say, is 
that if the MFA were banned overnight it would not necessarily 
be India that would benefit the most. Compared to the 
state-of-the-art textile makers of Hong Kong and southeast Asia, 
Indian industry is still a few steps behind. Though 13 years is 
too long, India needs a breathing space as well.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 19--The swadeshi hardliners in the 
BJP forced the party to retain a crucial clause in the economic 
resolution on the Dunkel draft which called for the "total" 
rejection of proposals aimed at expanding the scope of the 
General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT). 
  The original draft which had incorporated the clause was 
dropped after being screened by a few party general secretaries. 
When the draft was put before the BJP national executive, many 
members stood up to press for the complete opposition to the 
proposed GATT treaty. 
  The leaders who were in favour of the party adopting a 
"middle of the road" attitude over the Dunkel draft found 
themselves isolated and the majority opinion prevailed. Members 
argued that the party could not afford to take a wishy-washy 
attitude over the draft in view of the strong line adopted by 
other Opposition parties over the issue. 
  A few voices which spoke in favour of advocating a partial 
opposition to the Dunkel proposals were heavily outnumbered. The 
final draft which was presented to the Press had been worked out 
by party general secretaries, Mr Pramod Mahajan, and Mr K.N. 
Govindacharya and the convenor of the BJP economic cell, Mr Jay 
Dubashi. 
  The discussion on the Dunkel proposals could not be expanded 
to include other contentious issues regarding the party's stand 
on liberalisation, but many in the party who feel that swadeshi 
should be taken in a big way, welcomed the view of speakers 
calling for strong reaction to the Dunkel proposals. Leaders who 
have been known to have differences with swadeshi hawks who 
believe that foreign capital should be treated with extreme 
caution were conspicuously silent. 
  The resolution on the Dunkel draft is the only concrete 
document that the party has adopted. The two other documents are 
in the nature of poll analysis. The party had previously limited 
its opposition to the Dunkel draft proposals dealing with 
agriculture, but has now announced its total rejection of the 
move to globalise trade and lower tariffs. 
  The senior party leader, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, who 
addressed the Press today, denied that the party had belatedly 
woken up to the dangers of the Dunkel draft's proposals. "We 
have been speaking on the agriculture-related before and now 
that the government has failed to protect our interests, we have 
decided to take up the issue," he said. 
  The resolution states that the government's acceptance to 
the 
officials-level agreement over the GATT treaty amounted to 
sacrificing the interests of the country. The day on which the 
agreement was signed would go down as a "Black Day" in the 
nation's history. 
  The rich nations have used their economic muscle to ride 
roughshod over the interests of the poor nations and the 
proposed treaty would keep the Indian consumer at the receiving 
end of powerful multinational corporations, the resolution 
states. The Third World was once again facing the threat of a 
new type of colonial aggression, it emphasised. 
  The resolution attacks the Union commerce minister, Mr 
Pranab 
Mukherjee, for having stated in Parliament that India had not 
been able to stand up to the pressures exerted by the US and the 
European union. While the South Korean Premier had tended in his 
resignation at being unable to protect the country's commitment 
not [to] allow rice imports, the P.V. Narasimha Rao government 
had virtually opened the entire economy. 
  The statement also points out that the prices of food would 
rise and the buffer stock would be under threat. Giving an 
example, the resolution states that China has increased its 
exports manifold and enjoys a trade surplus. However, reports 
today said that China has accepted all GATT conditions needed 
for it to rejoin the negotiation process.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "The GATT Is in the Fire"] </F>
  [Text] The storm over the government's meek submission to 
the Dunkel draft as now inscribed in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade is not over. It has only subsided for the 
present. 
  According to the Constitution, Parliament cannot prevent the 
government from signing treaties. However, ratification may be 
greatly delayed or may not materialise at all for years, like in 
the case of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
  This does not mean the almost weeklong uproar over GATT was 
an exercise in futility. Rather, it brought home to the 
government serious misgivings on the economic arrangement to 
which India has been committed. 
  This has been a desperate gamble by a government commanding 
only minority support in the Lok Sabha. It is the precise reason 
behind the government's studied ambiguity on every item that may 
affect the country under the new world trade regime. 
  The statement by Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the Union commerce 
minister, has tried to hide rather than reveal the actual 
implications of the trade regime, to be ushered in next year. 
Associated Press filed a report from Geneva on December 17 that 
said, "Indian farmers and drug companies are likely to be hit by 
patent fees on seeds and pharmaceuticals." 
  Mr Mukherjee has tried to cover up even this. That the 
prices 
of medicines will shoot up cannot be denied. 
  Mr Eduardo Faleiro, the minister of state for chemicals, has 
assured the country the government can control prices of 
medicines through the drug price control order. He is well aware 
that no international commitment by the government can be 
negated by any control at home. 
  This is particularly true when the present government is 
fervently offering oblations to the god of the market. 
  The government has never taken Parliament into serious 
confidence about the problems and pitfalls in the Uruguay round. 
At the Funta del Este meeting of GATT in 1986, India took a firm 
stand which some bureaucrats sought to surreptitiously modify. 
But this was scotched at Montreal. 
  However, the surrender lobby was never disarmed. Its 
intrigues continued until it came on top in 1991 with the 
present government. 
  The line of surrender was clearly palpable when the Dunkel 
draft was first published two years ago. Not accidentally, this 
was precisely the point when the government was practically 
hijacked by the International Monetary Fund-World Bank 
mafia--Mr Manmohan Singh and his team. 
  The capitulation line in GATT fitted beautifully with 
submission to the IMF's structural adjustment prescription two 
years ago. In fact, the Dunkel draft represented an essential 
component of Manmohanomics. 
  Thinking the Dunkel injunctions could be defied without 
upsetting the well-entrenched structural adjustment edifice of 
the finance ministry is absurd. A similar argument is it would 
be disastrous if India refused to sign GATT. 
  This is similar to the argument about the problems in case 
India failed to meet commitments on debt servicing in 1991. As 
with the new economic policy, the government has avoided telling 
Parliament the full implications of each item of the elaborate 
structure of the new GATT. 
  An extensive and exposing public campaign was launched 
immediately after the Dunkel draft was released, particularly on 
the question of patents. No recent campaign has mobilised such a 
wide response from intellectuals cutting across party lines. 
  The government was in a quandary. On the one hand it had 
already surrendered on the economic front to the Fund-Bank 
dictates due to the machinations of Mr Manmohan Singh and his 
team. On the other it had to contend with serious objections to 
the Dunkel draft by all political parties, including a 
considerable section of Congressmen. 
  Not surprisingly, the government took the subterfuge of 
so-called consultations to cover up its capitulation at the GATT 
talks. A cabinet sub-committee was set up under Mr Arjun Singh 
to elicit public opinion on the Dunkel draft. It met a number of 
spokesmen with different points of view. No one has been told of 
the outcome of the exercise. 
  Despite representations by different bodies, public meetings 
and discussions, the government maintained a studied silence at 
home. Meanwhile, it was virtually inactive at the negotiating 
table in Uruguay. 
  Indian initiative in rallying the developing nations to 
force 
changes in the world trade pattern is not possible. The 
negotiators themselves were hamstrung by the government's 
continuous commitments to the Fund-Bank. 
  The government's mendacious position is clear from the 
timetable it fixed for the final round of parliamentary 
discussion on the Dunkel draft. The deadline for the new GATT 
accord being December 15, the government conceded a debate in 
Parliament to begin on December 6. Obviouisly, the government 
was not serious about the debate influencing its stand at Geneva. 
  Even Mr Mukherjee's statement could be extracted by 
Parliament after the cabinet had already instructed the 
government's representative at GATT to sign the new accord. As 
in the case of economic policy, the government moved without 
consulting Parliament, though it does not command a clear 
majority in Lok Sabha. 
  Though a public campaign by an informed body of concerned 
citizens is on, this was not reflected in the Opposition's 
performance in the past two years. There have been angry 
protests in both houses of Parliament in the past week but only 
after the horse had fled from the stable. 
  The standing committee of Parliament attached to the 
commerce 
ministry examined the Dunkel draft for six long months. It 
submitted its report only on December 13--two days before the 
GATT deadline. So, its critical evaluation of the draft is only 
of academic interest. 
  Had this job been given top priority and done three months 
earlier, there could have been some chance to force the 
government on this issue. As in other urgent issues nowadays, 
Parliament is defaulting in its role as the mirror of public 
perception and concern. 
  It is clear from the world situation that GATT is hardly 
going to establish a global regime of peaceful trade. Frictions 
are inevitable between countries, regional groups and certainly 
the developed giants of the Group of Seven. 
  It is widely perceived the new era following the end of the 
Cold War will witness fierce rivalry among industrial giants for 
capturing the world market. In other words, an unprecedented 
trade war is in the offing. 
  In such a situation, a watchful government in the developing 
world representing the bulk of the world's manpower, resources 
and market can effectively intervene to defend third world 
interests. Whether India will aspire to play this role and if 
the present establishment, with the halter of Manmohanomics 
round its neck, can play it is for the nation to judge.

<F P=106> [Article by Keith Flory: "Opposition Dismayed As Rao Avoids </F>
Speech on GATT"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 19--Elders ended the week on a 
particularly unhappy note. The "dirty tricks department" of the 
ruling party appeared to have reactivated itself, and while it 
ensured that the Opposition could not draw a drop of blood along 
with the proverbial pound of flesh, the manner in which the 
footlights faded on the Dunkel drama actually constituted one of 
the darker pages in the parliamentary chronicle. The Opposition 
was justified in feeling cheated. 
  After disrupting the House for almost two days over the 
signing of the Final Draft Act--to get the terminology 
correct--the Opposition had withdrawn its protest after being 
given to understand that the Prime Minister would address some 
of its anxieties. The Deputy Chairman had clearly told them Mr 
P.V. Narasimha Rao would make a statement and the closed-circuit 
television information system had flashed the same message. 
  Even when the Deputy Chairman ordered that clarifications be 
sought on the Commerce Minister's statement. Opposition members 
thought Mr Rao would eventually make a few remarks. They did not 
sense something amiss when, in response to a query from among 
their ranks about the Prime Minister making a statement, the 
Deputy Chairman indicated a change in the format. 
  Thus it was that the Opposition reacted with dismay and 
surprise when, immediately after Mr Pranab Mukherjee concluded 
his reply, the House was adjourned for the day. There was no 
opportunity to demand that the Prime Minister speak and no 
chance to exercise the legitimate form of expressing displeasure 
through a walk-out. 
  The manner in which the Government handled the entire affair 
did nothing to suggest that it genuinely treated members with 
respect. When the Opposition questioned the veracity of 
newspaper reports that the Cabinet had given the negotiators in 
Geneva the green signal, there was no response. It took an 
occupation of the well to dislodge Mr Kamaluddeen Ahmed from his 
seat, and all he had to offer was that a statement might be made 
later in the day. 
  The Opposition did not overdo the obstructionist tactics. 
The 
Deputy Chairman ordered a brief adjournment, saying she would 
contact the Commerce Minister. When the House reassembled, no 
protest was made when Dr Najma Heptullah explained that she had 
not been able to talk to the Minister since he was attending a 
meeting. Then Mr Mukherjee came to the House, but only minutes 
before the scheduled lunch-break. 
  Yet when the post-lunch session commenced, it was announced 
that the statement would be made the following day--after the 
agreement would have been signed. Obviously, the reaction of 
the Opposition was one of extreme displeasure and the House was 
brought to a virtual standstill. Disgruntled members relented on 
the understanding that the Prime Minister would intervene, but 
as things turned out, that was not to be. 
  It was not merely from the parliamentary angle that the 
Government bungled. The impression it sent out was that it was 
not particularly convinced about the positive aspects of the 
agreements. The parliamentary version of the GATT dispute also 
brought another important issue into focus--the status of the 
reports of the Standing Committees that were introduced earlier 
this year. The Opposition maintained that the Government had 
totally ignored the unanimous recommendations of a committee 
comprising members of all the political parties, and, therefore, 
questioned the utility of the Standing Committees. It was only 
technically correct. 
  As the Commerce Minister pointed out, the committee 
presented 
its report to Parliament only a day before the expiry of the 
deadline to sign the agreement, so how could anyone expect the 
Government to formulate its negotiating stance on the basis of 
the report? 
  Since just about anyone with even a faint knowledge of the 
GATT process was aware of the December 15 deadline, surely the 
committee, headed by an experienced person like Mr I.K. Gujral, 
ought to have been alert about that. What purpose, other than 
completing a formality, could the members of the committee have 
imagined would be served by submitting a report on December 14? 
  The ruling party members appeared quite happy that they had 
outplayed the Opposition and averted any kind of attack on the 
Prime Minister. But they wore false smiles. They had not been 
deft, but devious. And the difference between the two is 
enormous. 
  The varied tactics adopted by the BJP to protest against the 
arrest of its leaders (not particularly effective since by the 
end of the week few even took note of its absence) resulted in 
M.P.s doing some thinking about the disruption of question hour 
as a valid form of protest. When the members of the other 
parties raised strong objections to being denied one of their 
most valued instruments, the message went home. No disruptions 
thereafter. 
  There was, however, another dimension to the issue.

<F P=106> [Article by Sudha Bhatia: "What GATT Means for India"] </F>
  [Text] India's main objective in signing the new General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) treaty is to increase its 
share in world trade, which in 1992 was a meagre 0.4 per cent of 
the total $3,500 billion. Protagonists of the new treaty say 
that India has all the policy instruments in place to increase 
its share to at least the 1950s level of 3.6 per cent. 
  The question is, what are the likely gains for India's 
exports? Can India capture a share of the additional expansion 
of world trade following the Uruguay Round by AD 2005? The GATT 
secretariat offers a clue when it says that the largest 
increases in trade will come in textiles and clothing and in 
agriculture--areas in which India is competitive. Movement of 
personnel is another area in which India is expected to gain. 
  On the other hand, what is of grave concern is India is the 
impact of the new intellectual property regime on the drugs and 
pharmaceuticals industry and prices. A look at the sector 
specific implications reveals the following: 
<H5>  Services </H5>
  A gain for India. The US has made one of the best offers 
allowing global movement of 65,000 skilled professionals 
annually in the software services sector, medical and 
educational fields. However, Indian negotiators are disappointed 
that the offers do not cover semi-skilled workers. 
  Australia and Canada have also offered no caps on movement 
of 
skilled personnel for individual professionals. Using a crude 
indicator, even if 10,000 personnel move to the US in one year 
and save $1,000 per month, the total remittances that could 
accrue to India are $120 million, and that just from the US. 
However, these gains could be substantially diluted if India 
does not offer "significant" market access in financial 
services. A "comprise" clause says that countries can modify 
their offers, if there are no improvements in access for 
financial services. 
<H5>  Textiles </H5>
  By far the biggest gain for India. The gains will, however, 
be long term ones. India's potential as a leading exporter is 
evident from the fact that out of the average imports by 
developed countries in the six year period of 1986 to 1991, 
which was to the tune of $66 billion, the share of the 
developing countries, despite the import quotas, was half, at 
$33 billion. 
  A measure of India's strengths in this sector can also be 
gauged from the fact that in 1990-91, this accounted for a 
quarter of India's merchandise exports. 
  According to industry analysts, India's main rivals--South 
Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia--are expected to lose 
their competitive edge due to high wage costs. India and China 
are expected to emerge as the major players, says one of India's 
chief negotiators. 
<H5>  TRIPS </H5>
  Trade related intellectual property rights (TRIPs) will have 
the most serious implications for the Indian drug industry and 
consumers who will have to pay higher prices. "Prices will go up 
by as much as 10 to 15 times," according to B.K. Keayla of the 
National Working Group on Patent Laws. The rise in prices is 
estimated on the basis of comparisons with drug prices in 
Pakistan which recognises product patents. Mr Keayla argues that 
Pakistan is the most relevant comparison as it has comparable 
living standards. 
  A complex world will be ushered in where Indian firms will 
exploit the process patent regime, an area where it has 
considerable expertise. Transnationals will exploit both the 
process and the product patent regime. As a result, an 
"anti-competitive situation will develop amongst both Indian 
firms and transnationals." This tendency will be more acute 
among the latter. 
  The benefits of the transitional period--10 years--for India 
has also been considerably diluted as process and product 
patents registered after the enforcement of agreement, will be 
granted exclusive marketing rights. Mr Keayla also warns that 
"transnationals can develop new processes claiming less toxicity 
and side effects and secure exclusive marketing rights," even 
though their products may have been registered before the date 
of the enforcement of the agreement. 
  More importantly, industry sources say that as imports will 
be granted the same patent rights as domestic production, 
enhanced protection for intellectual pro-party will not lead to 
significant foreign investment inflows in this sector. 
  Micro-organisms, which are useful for varying purposes, 
including raising agricultural production to pharmaceutical 
applications, are not covered under the IPR provisions. At the 
same time, says a former Indian trade negotiator, "There is no 
express clause that these will be excluded, leaving room for 
dispute." 
  Seeds will become patentable, but farmers will have the 
right 
to store and re-use seeds. Estimates by the agricultural 
ministry show that seed prices will go up marginally by 5 to 7 
per cent, but farmers will be compensated by higher yields. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  Agriculture is expected to be the fastest growing sector in 
the post-Uruguay world, according to Anwarul Hoda, deputy 
director-general of GATT. This could open up India's opportunity 
for exports of wheat and sugar, if production is according to 
expectations. There are welfare gains in this as well, as these 
are labour-intensive crops. However, it is not clear to what 
extent US and the EC will cut subsidies on these crops, as the 
cuts apply on overall volumes and not specific crops. This will 
enable the countries to manage the cuts in such a way that their 
export competitiveness is not hurt. 
  The cuts on subsidies are expected to help Indian farmers as 
world agricultural prices will rise by 10 per cent. The gap 
between international and domestic prices is expected to widen, 
making exports attractive. For instance, using indicative 
figures, the present domestic price for wheat is Rs 4,000 per 
tonne, whereas the expected international price could be well 
over Rs 5,000 per tonne. 
<H5>  Customs Duties </H5>
  Developed countries will have to cut import duties on 
industrial goods from an average of 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent 
over five years. On top of this, over 40 per cent of the imports 
by the rich countries will be duty free. Duties will be scrapped 
on items like steel, pharmaceuticals, furniture, paper--areas 
where India enjoys a competitive edge. 
  Take a look at our potential: According to experts, our 
integrated steel producers will gain as we are competitive in 
semi-finished products like billets, blooms and plates. Our 
export price of plates is approximately Rs 11,000 a tonne, 
whereas the international price is Rs 12,000 a tonne. Our export 
price of HR coils is $250 a tonne, whereas the international 
price is $270 a tonne. 
  Chemical exports like dye stuff and oleo-resins should also 
increase sharply due to the drastic cuts in tariff rates by 
countries like the US from a weighted average of 7.2 per cent to 
4 per cent over a period of five years. 
<H5>  New Trade Body </H5>
  This will give teeth to enforce the GATT commitments. The 
powers of the US to take recourse to unilateral action under 
Section 301 will also be significantly diluted. If a member 
country does not comply with the commitments offered in the new 
GATT discipline, a complainant will have to seek a consensus 
from other member countries whether such a charge is just. 
Again, even if the findings are in favour of the complainant, a 
country cannot retaliate without a "multilateral authorisation." 
However, the US is expected to find new ways to apply Section 
301 to areas which are not covered by the GATT discipline, 
according to a senior member of the GATT secretariat. 
<H5>  Balance Sheet </H5>
  In the final analysis, the new GATT package offers a mixed 
bag of pluses and minuses for India. Whether India will be able 
to capitalise on the opportunities will be determined by the 
course of events and the support of countries like the US and 
those of the EC. Imperfect as the GATT package may be in 
addressing the concerns of developing nations like India, it 
will be unwise to step out and lose the benefits that 
multilateralism confers on member countries. If India opts out, 
pressures to yield much more in bilateral negotiations will 
intensify for acquiring similar benefits embodied in the new 
GATT treaty.

<F P=106> [Article by Nahum Barna'] </F>
  [Text] Tomorrow, on Monday, Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahab 
Darawishah is to be greeted with full honor, esteem, and dignity 
by the prime minister's bureau. Darawishah is the indubitable 
representative of the intermediate generation in the politics of 
the Israeli Arabs: His roots are in the Labor Party of the 
military government. His refuge is in the Islamic movement. The 
election results and the departure of SHAS [Torah Observing 
Sephardim] gave fateful strength to Darawishah's influence. With 
it, Rabin has a closed bloc. Without it, there is no bloc and 
there is no government. Darawishah wags his finger and threatens 
Rabin that if he does not appoint him minister, he will take the 
finger from him. 
  Darawishah, members of Labor and Meretz whisper, is nervy, 
an 
extortioner, and irresponsible. Nervy because he knows that 
Rabin cannot seat an Arab alongside of the government table. 
There is a security problem, and there is an even more difficult 
problem--the reaction of the Jewish public opinion. An 
extortioner because he is attacking Rabin at a moment of 
weakness. Irresponsible because he is endangering the accord 
with the PLO, which most Israeli Arabs, including Darawishah, 
himself, support 100 percent. 
  Essentially, the coalition is now telling Darawishah, and 
through him, all Israeli Arabs: You have a choice--either peace 
or equality. You will not get both together. 
  The truth is that, more than teaching us about defects in 
Darawishah's character, the crisis is teaching us about the 
difficulty of Jews in making order out of there confusing, 
impossible relation with Israeli Arabs. 
  When the Likud was in power, he turned them, ideologically, 
into part of the population of the territories. Arabs from 
Taybeh were treated the same as Arabs from Nabulus. We are 
speaking of one problem, an internal problem. Both of them will 
live to win under the government of the Jews. 
  From a practical aspect, the Likud worked in the opposite 
way: They did their best to distance the Israeli Arabs from the 
influence of the territories. Every piece of information 
regarding the association of Israeli Arabs to the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) was received with great shock. The 
smell of betrayal hovered in the air. 
  The Labor Party came and turned everything upside down: 
According to the global view, they are trying to change the 
Palestinian problem from an internal to an external one. The key 
word to the solution is "withdrawal." The negotiating partner is 
Tunisia. The goal, as Rabin formulated it, is that they will 
live their lives, and, we, separately, will live our lives. 
  If there is any logic to conducting policy, even security 
policy, the work would have had to break into the separation of 
Israeli Arabs from the Arabs of the territories. Up to here, the 
PLO--and from here on, the State of Israel. The Israeli 
Government will not conduct the politics of Nabulus, and the PLO 
will not conduct the politics of Baqah al-Garbayah. 
  In reality, the opposite is occurring. Ahmad Tibbi, an Arab 
citizen of Israel, recently earned the official title of 
presidential adviser to the president of the State of Palestine. 
Tibbi is a shrewd, political veteran and a superior speaker. His 
advice certainly contributed to the peace process. But, it is 
difficult to understand how an Israeli citizen could serve in an 
official role in a foreign system and to still come, in the 
authority of this role, into the prime minister's office. If 
Ahmad Tibbi is needed as an adviser to his head of state, it is 
fitting to appoint him as Rabin's adviser. This is the proper 
message that the Israeli Government can currently deliver to its 
Arab citizens. 
  Darawishah represents a similar dilemma. Recently, knowledge 
of the attempt by government factors to convince 'Arafat to 
influence Darawishah to cease his threats were published. An 
unpleasant smell is rising from this information. If 'Arafat is 
Darawishah's landlord, Darawishah has no place next to the table 
of the Israeli Government. In contrast, if the citizens of 
Israel in Nazareth and Rahat and 'Ar'arah are Darawishah's 
emissaries, they and not an angel, they and not a seraph, they 
and not 'Arafat, then he is not an extortioner or nervy, any 
more so than Ya'aqov Shefi, Menahem Prosh, Shlomo Benyizri, or 
any other member of Knesset who is arguing over his vote with 
the prime minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Arye Egozi: "The Ground-Based Version of the </F>
`Baraq'"] 
  [Text] [There is] international interest in the 
ground-based version of the Baraq sea-to-sea missile. RAFA'EL, 
which developed the missile with Israel Aircraft Industries for 
the Navy, is offering the ground-based version to a number of 
countries, and it is estimated that several of them will 
purchase it. In recent weeks, a number of very successful tests 
of the Baraq missile were held, in the course of which it 
destroyed a Gabriel missile. According to foreign reports, Chile 
has also purchased the naval version of the "Baraq". At the same 
time, "RAFA'EL" is engaged in the development of a ground-based 
version, in which the missile is not mounted on a missile boat 
but on a large truck (See photograph [not 
reproduced]). This system is arousing great interest, 
because it is the first one in the world that is based on a 
missile that is capable of attacking fast-moving, low-level 
targets. A model of the system will be presented for the first 
time at the PIDAE [International Aerospace Fair] for defense 
equipment, which will be held in March 1994 in Santiago, Chile. 
The "Baraq" weighs 98 kg, is 2.1 meters long, and it is capable 
of attacking targets such as airplanes and missiles at a 
distance of 500 meters to 10 km.

<F P=106> [Article by Shlomit Tana: "Kibbutz B.M."] </F>
  [Text] Kibbutz members who work in the first kibbutz plant 
that is going to the stock exchange--the Abarot plant of the 
religious kibbutz B'erot Yitzhaq, which manufactures steel 
pipes--receive a graduated salary, like their wage-earning 
counterparts. Their monthly salaries range between 16,000 
shekels (for a manager) to 3,000 shekels (for a "common" 
laborer). 
  But the kibbutzniks' wages do not go into their pockets. 
Most 
of them do not even bother to look at their amounts. In any 
event, it cannot affect their standard of living. 
  Abarot's turning to the stock exchange about a year and a 
half ago, together with an external partner, necessitated 
implementing several "capitalistic" upheavals in the plant: 
establishing a graduated wage also for the kibbutznik workers; 
organizating a "Corporation B.M."; the appointment of a board of 
directors, on which representatives of the public also sit; and 
the implementation of a complete separation between the plant 
and the administrative and financial system of the owners--that 
is, the kibbutz. 
  The plant has ceased being just one of the kibbutz's 
branches. Today, the economic situation of the kibbutz is not 
reflected in the situation of the plant, and the kibbutz 
treasurer cannot withdraw monies from the plant in order to fill 
the kibbutz coffers. If one of the two entities--the plant or 
the kibbutz, goes bankrupt--those who seize its assets will not 
be able to touch the assets of the other. 
  Today, in Be'erot Yitzhaq, no one wants to go backwards. The 
manager of the industrial branch in the kibbutz, Eli'ezer 
Shafir, is responsible for three local industrial plants. 
According to him, it is already clear that, thanks to the 
turning to the stock exchange, Abarot's production has gone up 
(in 1992 it exceeded 40 million shekels) and that the management 
and the control methods have become more professional. "Now we 
are forced to insist on quarterly financial reports, and we have 
brought to the plant a director-general brought in from the 
city, 'Amos Benada." 
  But Shafir admits that there are also squeaks: kibbutz 
members feel that the plant was expropriated from them entirely; 
they argue that the management and the board of directors do not 
share information with them. 
  Today it is already forbidden to report in the bulletin or 
in 
the kibbutz assembly doubts concerning planned transactions. 
Thus, for example, the report on the purchase of 50 percent of 
the shares of the "Fibertek" plant was given to the members only 
after the deal had already been completed. 
  The Abarot plant, the pioneer of the kibbutzs on the stock 
exchange, differs from the seven kibbutz plants that followed it 
in the last half year. All seven are "net" kibbutz plants, 
without any external partners. About a year after Abarot went to 
the stock exchange, Kineret's "Hopit" plant for the manufacture 
of plastic containers went to the exchange. After it came 
"Spencrete" of Palmahim, "Ortal" and "Tal" of Neveh-Or and 
Mishmarot. 
  Shares of "Kafrit" of Kfar-'Aza, "Gan-Shmu'el Preserves 
Manufacturing," and "Ma'abarot Products" were issued in the wave 
of flotations of recent weeks. 
  The chairman of the kibbutz Industry Association, Micha 
Hertz 
of Nir-Yitzhaq, estimates that 20 to 25 kibbutz plants will go 
to the stock exchange during 1994. In five of them, this has 
already been approved by the kibbutz assembly. According to him, 
on the kibbutzs' road to the stock exchange it will be necessary 
to overcome ideological inhibitions and evil images. Many 
kibbutzniks still link the stock exchange with phoney, 
fictitious businesses and and speculation. Not to speak of the 
veterans, who view the whole affair as ideological bankruptcy. 
  Hertz: "We explain in the kibbutzim that this time we are 
not 
going to "play" on the exchange and to buy shares. They became 
entangled in the 1980's because of such "games." This time we 
are talking about the sale of shares. It must be remembered that 
today the kibbutzs are having difficulty obtaining capital from 
the banks due to their tremendous debt, which comes to 
approximately 12 billion shekels." 
  The Kibbutz Industry Association today comprises more than 
360 plants. Only a small portion of them are ready to go to the 
exchange from the viewpoint of their stockholders' equity and 
their economic strength. 
  The breakthrough into the capital market involves, as was 
stated, complicated considerations. The legal adviser of the 
Kibbutz Industry Association advises the kibbutzs that are 
weighing this step to take into account that they will have to 
relinquish the traditional kibbutz style of management. That is, 
it will no longer be possible "to settle things within the home." 
  The Securities Law requires a public corporation to publish 
all the information that is relevant to the investor. On account 
of this law, internal kibbutz questions are exposed to the audit 
of the Securities Authority. For example: Why is a handicapped 
kibbutz member placed next to a central machine? And why "are 
they wasting money" on the installation of air conditioning in a 
production area that is manned by only four workers? And how is 
it that the main operator of a machine is absent because the 
kibbutz has decided to make him responsible for preparing a 
Purim party? 
  [Box, p 14 by Hadar Horesh] 
<H5>  They Do Not Have A Good Reputation </H5>
  The kibbutzs do not have a good reputation at the stock 
exchange. David Bal'as's affair presented them as naive 
businessmen at best. The kibbutz crisis of the 1990's proved 
that most of them do not know how to adapt themselves to the 
modern business world. 
  This year the "Tekhen" affair exploded: a company that was 
established by the Takam [United Kibbutz Movement] in 1988, 
which raised 40 million shekels by issuing bonds to the 
investing public. The company passed on the money that it raised 
to the kibbutzs of the Takam, as loans. As was expected from the 
start, the kibbutzs could not pay their debts, and they are now 
seeking money from the government. 
  After the successful flotation of Abarot last year, many 
believed that a wave of flotations was coming from the kibbutz 
movements, but most of the planned flotations got bogged down en 
route: the management of the stock exchange presented severe 
requirements to the kibbutzs, including a series of arrangements 
that were intended to prevent the possibility of the kibbutz 
members benefiting from the revenues of the plant at the expense 
of the investors from the public at large. Some of the kibbutz 
plants were found "not ripe" for a flotation. 
  More than a year afterwards, kibbutz Kineret--one of the 
richest in the kibbutz movement--floated the "Hopit" plastics 
factory. In the last two months, the wave of flotations 
strengthened. In all, the kibbutzs raised approximately 120 
million shekels on the stock exchange. Three more kibbutzs are 
in advanced stages of an issue, and it appears that they will 
raise capital at the beginning of the next year. [end box]

  [Text] "There is a veiled underemployment in some of the 
Israel Defense Force's (IDF) commands," Prime Minister and 
Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told members of the Foreign and 
Defense Committee of the Knesset yesterday, meaning, by his 
words, the "army" of clerks at the Qiriya [government offices] 
in Tel Aviv. They have been on his mind for some time now. Not 
all of them--but many of them. 
  Who does not know the endless swarm of clerks that plods 
along every morning in exhaustion at the entrance to the Qiriya, 
trampling outside at noon to scramble for something at the 
eateries of Even-Gvirol Street, walking slowly back to the 
offices, and, exactly at 1700--but exactly--flowing outside the 
gates of the Qiriya, directly into the long cork on Kaplan 
Street. [sentence as published] 
  Many among us, especially those of us with combat history, 
call them "jobniks," or even "parasites." When we say, in the 
Friday salon talks, that we can cut back on offices, 
electricity, office equipment, and, primarily, cadres and 
salaries--we are referring to them. 
  Both Yitzhaq Rabin and Ehud Baraq think so, but they are 
trapped. It is not possible to lay off hundreds of these clerks, 
and even the Israel Defense Force's (IDF) earnest attempts at 
reducing and cutting are not resulting in the longed for change. 
In the Qiriya's hallways, it turns out, marches a different army 
from the one along the borders and in the territories, and it 
has its own rules. 
  Every few years, a new program of cuts emerges, which is 
"thrown" at one command or another: They cut a branch here, a 
section there, lip service from the aspect of many, but the 
primary mass still remains, and there is a veiled 
underemployment. Even an open one. 
  Major General (Res.) 'Amos Yaron, former head of the IDF 
manpower branch, does not take issue with Rabin, but he is 
cautious. "In every large organization, the slogan `there is a 
veiled underemployment' is correct. There are many people in 
this bureaucratic organization known as the army, which does not 
always operate according to economic considerations. Every few 
years they say this in order to put pressure on the system, to 
signal to the commands that the command is on the ball and they 
must become efficient. And, therefore, they make cuts--but, they 
expand again." 
  Yaron says that saying must be repeated over and over, 
because the commands each have an independent character. When 
you do not "sit" on them, they start to expand. For example: A 
lieutenant colonel who wants to promoted to colonel and begins 
to "rush" work papers to his boss creates new assignments for 
himself, all of which is under the strange heading 
"specialization." He demands a cadre, authorizations, officers, 
offices, and, of course, clerks. And commanders, as is known, 
love clerks around them. The staff work of that same lieutenant 
colonel can bear fruit one fine day, and then, suddenly, a new 
section pops out of nowhere, with it the cadre, and, of course, 
the underemployment. 
  Yaron: "In my time, there was a daily war with veiled 
underemployment in some of the commands. You have to be on the 
ball all of the time. The current chief of general staff could 
cut more and does not need to be urged to do so, because there 
are budget problems, and he wants to cut cadres in any case. It 
is very good that the commands know that they are being 
examined, for if this does not happen, another month will pass 
and everything will swell up again." 
  Sheqem director-general, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Gabi Nave, who 
was 
responsible for manpower in the navy, says that the wasteful 
image that has been pinned to the commands is not correct. 
"People get an impression from the hundreds of cars in the big 
cities, which are there from the command locations, and they 
have a sense of underemployment. In the navy, for example, there 
are cuts all of the time, and there is a small command there 
that is purposeful and very competitive. They are always making 
cuts in it, but the reservist who arrives and sees clerks who 
are sitting and not doing anything goes home and tells his 
friends. That same underemployed clerk does the same thing. 
  Nave says that the veiled underemployment cannot be reduced 
to a minimum, because the level of activity in the army changes 
and is not constant. "The army will never become an economical 
plant with a manufacturing premium and norms. The IDF is does a 
lot to become efficient, and, indeed, changed to a five-day work 
week. If I had asked someone 10 years ago whether this was 
possible, they would have answered in the negative." 
  Maj. Gen. (Res.) Yaron sharpens the point. "We must reach a 
state of no underemployment, and it is possible to reduce and 
cut a lot, but the result will be that many will not be 
mobilized into the IDF or will be released. This, apparently, is 
impossible, as long as the IDF is defined as a national army. We 
are in a trap. If we mobilize everyone, then the commands swell, 
there is underemployment. and there are male and female soldiers 
who do not do a thing." 
  Col. (Res.) Nava Fels, former commander of Training Center 
12, says that it is possible to cut back, and calls for starting 
with the Women's Corps system. According to her, the obligatory 
mobilization of women to the IDF should be canceled in 
preference to a professional army to which only those who want 
to and are wanted are mobilized. 
  "I sometimes do not understand how this system works," Fels 
says. "Today, when I am in the simple civilian class, it is 
difficult for me to absorb what terrible norms of 
underemployment exist in the army, especially in the Women's 
Corps system, and no one is getting up and making a peep. This 
matter should be stopped immediately. The problem of the people 
in the army is that they are in it too much and they do not see 
what is happening around it. As in every plant where they 
examine the level of performance and effectiveness of the 
workers--this must also be done in the army, and the sooner the 
better."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "SHALL Report Criticizes Kuwaiti </F>
Government Attempt To Justify Investments in Failed Banks"] 
  [Text] The weekly AL-SHALL economic report criticized the 
government's attempt to justify investments in failed banks, 
such as the Tunis International Bank, the Bahrain Middle East 
Bank, and the French-Kuwaiti Bank. The report stated: "Kuwait's 
financial reputation should not be linked with those 
institutions' situation." 
  The following is the text of the report: 
<H5>  Foreign Investments </H5>
  The Kuwaiti press has published a government report 
concerning the progress of action to prosecute the foreign 
investments case. This is the case that has caused, and 
continues to cause, debate. It affects considerably the 
credibility of all authorities in the country in regard to 
facing up to other issues. The report contains what would 
theoretically be expected. The first part lists a number of 
measures that the government has taken to try or prosecute 
principals accused of embezzlement over a long period of time, 
including the occupation period. There is no doubt that there 
are those in the government who sincerely want to bring the case 
to its natural conclusion, using all judicial and political 
means to finish the case by prosecuting the accused. However, 
the feeling that this is not the position of the entire 
government raises certain violent, negative reactions. The scope 
of the incident, the timing of its occurrence, the profuse 
evidence regarding violations, and the list of the accused names 
require zealous political pursuit. At the least, we would like 
to see certain positions change for the positive. 
  In the second part, the report explains the changes that 
have 
occurred in the General Investments Board--administrative, 
functional, and in future strategy. The London office has been 
incorporated under the board's umbrella, and its powers limited. 
There is also a pledge to prepare a detailed internal program to 
regulate the powers and responsibilities of the three offices 
(London, Kuwait, and the support office) scheduled to be 
established. Moreover, the board intends to prepare its ideas 
concerning its investments and directions, with the assistance 
of specialists from among the directors of its portfolios and 
its investment specialists, and will periodically change course 
if the situation requires. This would have been the most 
complete and strongest part of the report, if there had also 
been the slightest hint or reference to the board's intent to 
study the effect of the pressures or tight restrictions that the 
general financial deficit is exerting, over time, on the size of 
the investments and on the board's organization and strategy in 
general. 
  Perhaps the report's weakest part is the attempt to justify 
the government's deposits in the Tunis International Bank and 
the Bahrain Middle East Bank among the large group of banks and 
financial companies in which Kuwait participates. This, of 
course, also applies to the French-Kuwaiti Bank, since it is 
unacceptable to link Kuwait's reputation to these institutions' 
situations. Because of the volume of investments in these banks, 
one cannot justify intervening in the manner that was done and 
under the financial circumstances that existed in the country. 
Despite that, the intervention did not save most of these 
institutions, as was our case with Spain during the same period. 
  Certain circles are raising fears about a collapse that 
might 
occur in the prices of certain assets, as a result of some 
civilians offering their assets in order to have sufficient 
liquidity to meet their obligations. We do not agree with this, 
neither in terms of principle nor in terms of the situation's 
possibilities. With respect to principle, there should be no 
case of intervention to adjust prices, because market forces are 
sufficient to modify prices at their true level, even if 
downturns occur that go below that value in the short term. 
Perhaps our experiences in intervention, all of which failed 
after the "climate," are the best evidence of the program's 
faults. Perhaps Japan's recent experience in not intervening 
when its share indicator dropped from 38,000 to under 116,000 
points [figures as published], including companies whose 
products we deal with in all aspects of our lives, is additional 
evidence from the experiences of the world around us. 
  In terms of the situation, despite the country's passing 
through the disaster of a destructive occupation, the value of 
the companies registered in the market is still, as of 15 
December 1993, slightly higher than their value on the day 
before the occupation. A reading of the AL-SHALL indicator for 
15 December 1993 shows 101.6 points. This is an indicator of 
value, which means that the value of the investors' shares is 
higher than it was before the occupation. It is assumed, 
theoretically at least, that less value would be acceptable. 
  The situation is that the indicator's reading on 7 July 
1993, 
i.e., before talk about being close to agreement on the 
difficult debt program, was 92.7 points and was within the 
bounds of acceptability. The indicator rose rapidly and 
illogically to 111.5 points on 15 September 1993, i.e., after 
publication of Law No. 41/93. This was a 20 percent rise. The 
indicators of certain companies rose, due to the possibility of 
their benefitting from the program, to 2.9 times what they had 
been before the occupation, while others rose 2.5 times. These 
increases were illogical or unjustifiable. It was inevitable 
that the prices that had risen without justification would fall, 
because of their probable financial performance. The object of 
pushing their prices to the highest was to achieve profits over 
the short term. This must have surely affected the possibilities 
of increase of supply because of the program, or even because of 
the possibility of a psychological effect that it could leave 
behind. Despite that, the reading of the indicator last week was 
higher by 8.9 points than it was on 7 July 1993, i.e., 9.6 
percent.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi--the United Arab Emirates [UAE] has 
affirmed its intention to join GATT. UAE Economy and Trade 
Minister Sa'id Ghabbash told AL-HAYAH that his ministry is 
currently drafting a study on the GATT agreement for submission 
to the Cabinet so that the later can decide whether the UAE will 
join GATT. 
  He added that the study will elucidate how joining GATT 
would 
be to the UAE's advantage. He said that the UAE has observer 
status in GATT and participates in all of its meetings. 
  Economic sources assert that joining GATT would provide many 
benefits for the UAE, because taxes in the UAE on imports are 
very low; they do not exceed 4 percent and are as low as 1 
percent for many commodities and imports. 
  If it joins GATT, the UAE will be compensated by a drop in 
taxes and customs duties levied on UAE exports to other 
countries of the world. 
  Representatives of 117 countries approved the agreement on 
15 
December 1993. The OECD expects that international trade will 
grow by 6.5 percent in 1995 as a result of the agreement reached 
in the Uruguay Round. 
  Ghabbash said that the effect of the UAE's entry into GATT 
on 
UAE ready-made clothing exports to the United States would not 
be quickly felt, because the transition to implementation of the 
agreement regarding clothes and textiles will last 10 years. He 
said that the export of ready-made, UAE-made clothes to the 
United States will be governed by a bilateral agreement between 
the two countries. He added that it was decided to extend this 
agreement for two years as of 1 January 1994 following 
negotiations between the Economy and Trade Ministry and the U.S. 
trade office. 
  The UAE Cabinet has approved a memorandum of understanding 
stipulating an extension of the agreement with the United 
States. This approval was conveyed to the U.S. Ambassador in Abu 
Dhabi early this week. 
  Ghabbash told AL-HAYAH that he expects a memorandum of 
understanding exchange between the ministry and the U.S. Embassy 
in Abu Dhabi next week. 
  He said that the agreement will regulate new quotas of 
ready-made clothing exports to the United States, and that it 
includes joint measures to stop producers outside of the UAE 
from circumventing the provisions of the agreement. 
  Ghabbash stressed that the Economy and Trade Ministry will 
cooperate with the Finance and Industry Ministry and pertinent 
UAE customs authorities to establish regulations that provide 
for effective supervision, ensure compliance by economic units 
in the UAE with decrees concerning the export of ready-made 
clothes, and eliminate the circumvention practiced by exporters 
to the United States. 
  An U.S. delegation recently visited ready-made clothing 
factories in the UAE with a view toward ascertaining their 
capabilities and production capacities and stopping violations 
regarding the export of their products to the United States. 
  Ghabbash said that the UAE will demonstrate greater concern 
with stopping erroneous practices on the part of foreign 
exporters of ready-made clothes through the UAE. 
  He added that the ministry held a course last October on 
"Controlling Export Operations" for representatives of the 
Economy and Trade Ministry, Finance and Industry Ministry, and 
other pertinent agencies in the UAE. 
  Economic circles indicate that, as of June 1993, the spun 
thread, textiles, and clothing sector had the fourth-largest 
number of factories registered in the UAE (116 factories or 12.8 
percent of the total number of factories in the UAE). In 
addition, factories have been built in the Jabal 'Ali free zone 
to enjoy the advantages which this zone offers to exporters. 
  The Finance and Industry Ministry recently decided to stop 
issuing new licenses for ready-made clothing factories. It is 
preparing a comprehensive study commissioned by the cabinet on 
the position of this industry. The ministry stresses the 
unfeasibility of establishing new factories in this sector at 
present.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yemeni Oil and Mineral Resources Minister </F>
Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun by Randah Taqiy-al-Din in Sanaa; 
date not given] 
  [Text] Yemeni Oil and Mineral Resources Minister Salih 
Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun said that the situation has improved 
following the accident that occurred in the Total company 
operations area. The security situation has begun to improve, he 
said. In a statement to AL-HAYAH he discussed the future of the 
oil sector and cooperation with the oil companies. He called for 
the establishment of "security guards in order to protect 
companies' operations and enable them to operate under normal 
conditions." The Yemeni minister said revenue from oil since 
1990 totalled about $2.5 billion and daily production at present 
is 310,000 barrels per day [bpd]. He said Yemen has signed a 
letter of intent with French companies for the development and 
modernization of Aden refinery. 
  The following is text of the interview: 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] What is the present average oil production 
and 
what are the expectations with regard to future production? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] Oil has a long history in Yemen. Exploration 
operations go back to the thirties, but because of the situation 
then and due to the policies pursued in the area the companies 
did not wish to get involved in oil exploration operations in 
Yemen, neither in the northern or southern parts. Recently a 
number of companies started work in the north and the south. 
After unity, the number of companies reached 30 nationalities. 
We produce oil only in three areas: 
  1. Ma'rib al-Jawf, or what we call Ma'rib al-Jawf basin 
where 
the Hunt Company is operating. It produces 180,000 bpd. 
  2. In Shabwah, Nimr Petroleum Company produces between 6,000 
and 7,000 bpd. 
  3. In Hadramawt, specifically in al-Masilah, where Canadian 
Oxy and its partners produce 20,000 bpd. 
  Thus our production reaches 310,000 bpd. There are great 
possibilities to increase production when new fields are 
discovered, particularly since some companies have now reached 
the stage of drilling and evaluating the wells capacity. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] Reports indicate that evaluation of new wells 
has been completed by the French Total Company in sector 10 of 
Shabwah. Is it possible to give us an idea about the reserves in 
the Jannah and Shabwah areas, and how will Total Company 
transport the oil which it will produce from the field it is 
operating? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] The Total Company, as an operator company, 
has 
helped us to find two discoveries, the first was in Biqa' No. 
5--in Jannah--where the reserve could reach 335 million barrels, 
according to preliminary estimates. 
  The second is in east Shabwah or sector No. 10 where there 
is 
an estimated 200 million barrels of reserve. The company is now 
carrying out an estimate of the quantities of reserve 
distributed among a small number of wells. A study is now being 
carried out of the quantities that can be extracted from the 
Jannah area or in the eastern sector of Shabwah. Negotiations 
are under way between the companies and the ministry regarding 
concluding the evaluation and beginning an estimation of what 
can be produced. Negotiations will soon begin between the 
government, the companies, and the companies owning the pipes in 
order to link production from the Jannah field to the line of 
Shabwah or the line of Safir. The al-Nimr Company is operating 
in Shabwah. 
  With regard to sector 10 in east Shabwah, we are now trying 
to link the Canadian Oxy line, which is the al-Masilah line. 
Negotiations are under way between the companies and sector 10. 
The production line will be linked to the al-Masilah line and 
sector No. 5 will be linked to either of the lines: either to 
Shabwah line in which al-Nimr company is operating, or to Safir 
line where the Hunt Company is operating. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] What type of oil is this? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] The oil in Jannah is light, and in sector 10 
is similar to that of al-Masilah. It is low in sulphur and 
desired by the world refineries. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] You gave us a figure about the recently 
discovered reserves in both sectors, but what will their daily 
production level be? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] According to information available to us so 
far, we can today produce from Jannah field 25,000 to 30,000 
bpd. If we can now link the transport lines it would be possible 
to begin production quickly, and within four to six months 
maximum we can begin production. 
  We can produce from sector 10, 15,000 to 20,000 bpd. We have 
another plan with Total Company to step up drilling operations 
in order to increase the number of wells in the sector. We have 
extended the company's license for another two years in order to 
provide the sector with a greater amount of data. In which case 
production can begin within a shorter period of time than 
required in Jannah, because it is very near. If we agree on a 
dialogue between the companies that will carry it out we can 
begin within three months. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] Are the new contracts with companies based on 
production sharing? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] Yes, they are based on production sharing and 
the provisions of the agreements that were signed after unity, 
totalling 26 agreements, are good for both the government and 
the companies. In some contracts the rate reaches 23 percent for 
the company and 77 percent for the state. At the same time the 
state obtains 10 percent of the rights before the production 
costs (agreements concluded before the unity). Agreements 
concluded after unity vary, such as, the contract with Canadian 
Oxy is 66.7 for the state and the rest is for the company. 
Agreements with Total Company are based on the same rate. In the 
agreement with Hunt Oil the company obtains 60 percent of the 
division, but the state has 50 percent rights of Hunt's share. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] What about Elf Aquitaine company resuming 
exploration? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] Alif Akitan has been operating in the Sayr 
Hazar sector, which is a big sector. Suspension of exploration 
is up to the company. The company claims that there are problems 
in the border area concession area, but we are now discussing 
those matters. The company will probably resume its work 
shortly, God willing. The sector in which the company carried 
out some substantial work in the past years is large. We are now 
discussing the resumption of work in the same sector. 
Discussions are in progress, and we believe the company might 
resume its work by the end of this year. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] An incident occurred in the Total operation 
area and one person was killed. What was the cause of this 
incident? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] An incident occurred in the camp following 
which the government took measures and arrested a number of 
people accused of perpetrating the incident. Such incidents do 
take place in certain areas. But this incident did not obstruct 
the company's work. Last year some experts were detained. All 
these incidents occured because of disputes over employment or 
nonemployment of citizens. But what is important is that the 
situation has improved and the government is devoting great 
attention to the companies. We might set up highly mobile 
security units that will be stationed at company sites so they 
can operate normally. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] What about the project that has been agreed 
upon to modernize the Aden refinery? 
  [Al-Husaynun] Two days ago we signed an agreement with a 
group of a French companies consisting of Foster Wheeler, 
[?Sijilik] and [?Francegi] to carry out an economic study for 
the modernization and development of the Aden refinery, which 
will be submitted to the ministry. Negotiations will be held 
with the companies regarding obtaining financing for the 
modernization which, if agreed upon, can be completed in two 
stages. The refinery is old and its production capacity is 
170,000 bpd. We have previously modernized Aden refinery and 
spent $140 million to build an oil plant, reservoirs, and 
dockyards. We now have signed an agreement with the Malaysians 
who will provide $50 million worth of electric power equipment 
in return for refining charges. 
  We hope to reach an agreement with the group of companies 
which we contracted to carry out the study at a cost of 
$400,000. Thus we will begin the plant modernization if an 
agreement is reached. Modernization means building refining 
units that are compatible with the modern installations 
available in the oil sector, i.e., is higher productive units 
than the ordinary ones. 
  What we propose to do at the first stage is to operate the 
refinery at its present capacity level, that is 8.5 million tons 
a year or 170,000 bpd. In subsequent years production will 
increase to 250,000 bpd. Modernization of the refinery will cost 
between $500 million to $600 based on the preliminary studies 
for the two stages. But the cost estimate was done before some 
of the modernization work which we carried out. The cost will be 
divided over stages, the first of which will be about $250 
million to $300 million, and the balance will be allotted to the 
second stage. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] From where will you get the finance for this 
project? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] We do not propose to enter into commercial 
financing using commercial loans. We are not ready to obtain 
high interest loans. But we are ready to obtain easy payment 
loans, repayable by services offered by the refinery, such as 
refining, storing, or anything else. We might obtain interest 
free loans repayable by a daily quantity of oil. This is what 
(?Alif) Company wishes to do if we agree on the conditions. We 
might also enter into partnership with the French companies. We 
will receive the study within four years. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] How do you view the political situation in 
the 
south, bearing in mind that you are a southerner? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] I would like to say that the unity has been 
achieved. It has been realized calmly and through a brotherly, 
democratic, and peaceful dialogue. Unity has long been the dream 
of all the Yemeni It has come to stay and will remain. 
  [Taqiy-al-Din] What about the vice president going into 
seclusion. This seclusion is causing concern over the situation. 
  [Al-Husaynun] First, I am against going into seclusion, but 
I 
am for the clarification of the issues and problems that are 
important for the people and for their daily life. I am for 
entering into direct negotiations in order to solve the problems.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Memorandum on Reasons Calling for </F>
Amending Articles of Republic of Yemen's Constitution"] 
<H5>  [12 Sep, p 7] </H5>
  [Text] A constitution is a fundamental law that defines the 
form of the state, the type of government, the method of 
regulating the structure and powers of public authorities, and 
the method of regulating their relations with each other. It 
also spells out the citizen's fundamental rights, liberties, and 
duties of individuals. 
  A constitution is tied to the presence of a state. There is 
no society with any degree of organization which does not have 
some fundamental rules that explain this society's system of 
government. Therefore, the lack of a constitution that regulates 
government affairs throws the door wide open for political 
conflicts among various political and intellectual tendencies. 
Moreover, the logic of force, domination, and monopolization of 
the control of government affairs prevails, thus resulting in 
many negative consequences that harm society's unity, stability, 
and development. 
  A constitution, like other laws, is a social phenomenon that 
expresses the spirit of the educational, intellectual, and 
cultural environment prevailing in a society. By its nature, 
this environment is subject to change in accordance with the law 
of ceaseless development in a society's life. This change 
dictates that a degree of accord and harmony be achieved between 
the new reality produced by the given facts of change and 
modernization in society's social, political, and economic life 
on the one hand and, on the other hand, society's fundamental 
law, which is embodied in the constitution, so that the latter 
will be subject to the logic of amendment that keeps up pace 
with and expands to accommodate the change. In other words, any 
change in life's ever-dynamic circumstances must be coupled with 
and accompanied by parallel development in the laws so that 
society's real conditions will not be divorced from its legal 
structure. 
  While acknowledging that it is important and necessary that 
a 
constitutional system be stable, this stability cannot be so 
absolute that it leads to rigidity in constitutional life. 
Absolute rigidity of constitutions is incompatible with the 
principle of development and it poses the threat of violent 
unrest in a society's life. Moreover, absolute constitutional 
rigidity results in denying sovereign nations the exercise of 
their sovereignty to amend their constitutions whenever they 
deem it necessary to do so. This contradicts the nature of 
things. How could a group impose on itself laws which it cannot 
amend afterward? In harmony with these logical considerations, 
we find that the constitutional legislator himself inserts into 
the constitution provisions that make it permissible to amend 
one or more articles of the constitution and that spell out the 
procedures that have to be observed in this regard. Thus, the 
negatives of slipping into absolute rigidity are avoided and, at 
the same time, a reasonable degree of stability in the 
constitutional system is ensured. 
  In a related area, when the constitutional legislator 
establishes the fundamental rules of the system of government 
and of public liberties in the state, he gives expressin to the 
true nature of the existing conditions and circumstances, be 
they political, social, or economic, and the nature of the 
tendencies and ideas prevailing at the time. Therefore, the 
legislator cannot bypass the circumstances and leap ahead of 
time, thus taking into account circumstances and conditions that 
have not developed yet. Therefore, it is a proven fact that when 
circumstances dictating amendment develop, amendment of the 
constitution becomes inevitable. This is because justifications 
for the continued presence of past conditions have disappeared 
and because one has to keep pace with new developments. 
  On this basis, we find that most political, economic, 
social, 
cultural, and administrative ideas and opinions on the national 
horizon of the Yemeni arena are unanimous that the 1981 
constitution of the republic was drafted under certain political 
circumstances that are different in form and content from the 
current political circumstances and all their transformations, 
changes, and developments. 
  The constitution has been founded, as everybody knows, on 
harmonizing the various political ideas and the contradictory 
positions that were adopted by the two former regimes under the 
extraordinary conditions of partition. Thus, the constitution 
document emerged as a formula which balanced the different 
political and organizational ideas and tendencies of each of the 
two parts. It was evident that the provisions of this document 
lacked precision, cohesion, and harmony. It was even rumored 
that some provisions had been written with the determination not 
to achieve anything for Yemen's unity. Despite all this, the 
supreme national interest dictated that the document's weak 
points and deficiencies be overlooked so as to preserve the 
harmony formula that had been developed and that was suitable as 
an agreed foundation for accomplishing the great objective. This 
formula constituted a gain then, having been achieved over a 
long period of time and only after great and exhaustive efforts. 
  It is well-known that the period from 1981 to 1992 produced 
a 
number of important national, regional, and international 
developments and changes, most significant of which was 
accomplishment of the great civilizational plan embodied in 
restoring unity and proclaiming the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 
1990. This development was followed by great national efforts to 
implement the process of the republic's political, economic, 
administrative, and judiciary development and merger through 
energetic and ceaseless efforts by the state's concerned 
authorities. These authorities have begun to eliminate the 
traces of partition and its hateful legacy. They have been able, 
despite the state's flawed institutional structure and despite 
the duality and ambiguity of the constitutional institutions, to 
accomplish numerous important institutional and legislative 
achievements to unify the Republic of Yemen. The recent period 
has produced numerous unified laws. That period has, moreover, 
led to rearranging and unifying most of the organizational and 
administrative structures and to establishing unified 
institutions and agencies that are engaged in various activities 
and that seek varied objectives. 
  It is worth noting now that prior to the referendum on the 
constitution, the Presidential Council had promised the people 
in a statement to present to the early meetings of the elected 
House of Representatives any observations brought up regarding 
the constitution. The fact that the current house has been 
elected in accordance with the constitution puts this house and 
the Presidential Council face to face with their responsibility 
to fulfill the commitments they had made to the people. 
  As an extension of this effective activity to build and 
develop the Republic of Yemen and in view of the fact that the 
practical application of the constitution has demonstrated that 
its provisions-- which are based, as we have already pointed 
out, on the circumstances under which it was drafted and 
prepared, i.e., the circumstances of partition--cannot keep up 
with the developments the region is experiencing, this 
constitution has to be reviewed and examined article by article 
so we can put our finger on its weaknesses and deficiencies and 
on the ambiguities in its principles and rules and so we can 
emerge with a new and clear vision that achieves harmony, that 
embodies unity's objectives, and that keeps pace with all of the 
national developments in the political, economic, and social 
areas. In this review and examination, consideration must be 
given to all the opinions, observations, and criticism voiced on 
some of the constitution's provisions. We must deal with 
whatever is raised in this regard with a patriotic and 
democratic spirit that respects contrary opinion and gives 
precedence to the supreme national interest. For all the general 
considerations and justifications explained above, it has become 
urgent to amend the constitution in order to secure the future 
of the democratic procession, to strengthen national unity, and 
to lay down sound foundations for building the modern state of 
Yemen--a state of constitutional institutions. This step is also 
a national mission with which to crown the accomplishments that 
have already been achieved in an endeavor to create Yemen's 
desired cultural revival under the modern edifice of a state of 
constitution and laws. There is no doubt that the national 
resolve which accomplished Yemen's unity is capable of achieving 
a lot to serve the country with the same patriotic spirit and 
peaceful national democratic dialogue which prevailed in the 
achievement of unity, that great historical accomplishment. 
  It is established and confirmed in constitutional and legal 
jurisprudence and it is unanimously agreed among jurisprudents 
and interpreters of constitutional law that the concept of 
constitutional amendment includes amending or abolishing what is 
extant and adding what is proposed to be included in the 
constitution. 
  Amendment includes amendment by addition, omission, 
abolition, or rephrasing. This is because a constitutional 
amendment is passed to meet an urgent need or to keep pace with 
existing developments or developments that are likely in the 
foreseeable future. Consequently, the firmness of a 
constitutional base hinges on its ability to absorb society's 
political, economic, cultural, and social constants and 
society's aspirations in all areas of society's activities, and 
for the longest time possible. 
  According to this legal framework, it is extremely important 
to review the issues on which the demand for amendment focuses, 
whether by rephrasing the constitutional article, by adding to 
it, by omitting from it, by abolishing it, or by adding new 
provisions to some sections and chapters of the constitution. 
The reasons dictating the demand for amendment must be clarified 
for every one of the issues included in the demand for such 
amendment. This clarification must be made according to the 
sequence of the constitution's sections and chapters, as shown 
in the following: 
<H6>  Section 1 </H6>
<H6>  Fundamentals of State </H6>
<H5>  Chapter 1 </H5>
<H5>  Political Fundamentals </H5>
  Article 1. It is required to amend this article by adding to 
it a phrase which emphasizes that the state, both as an entity 
and as people, belongs to Arabism and Islam. These two 
characteristics must be underlined for both the State of Yemen 
and the Yemeni people and not just for one without the other, 
which is what article one of the constitution has done. The 
article must also emphasize that the Yemeni people belong to the 
Islamic nation, in addition to being part of the Arab nation. 
The phrase "Islamic nation" should replace the "Islamic world." 
  Article 3. It is required to amend this article in order to 
clarify the source from which laws are derived by pointing out 
in a clearly worded phrase that the Islamic shari'ah is the 
source of all legislation, considering that there is no 
disagreement over this issue. We must do this on the basis of 
our belief in the dictates of the Islamic shari'ah and in the 
capacity of its tolerant teachings which can accommodate all 
changes and developments at all times and in all places. The 
shari'ah can accomplish this through its comprehensive sources 
of its controls that are defined in the principles of 
jurisprudence. These principles include sources from which laws 
appropriate for the development of human societies are derived. 
The sources include consensus, analogy, consent, the example of 
the prophet's companions, incompletely transmitted interests, 
and other evidence approved legally by Islamic jurisprudence. 
All this ensures the freedom of opinion in a manner that doesn't 
violate the Islamic shari'ah. 
<H5>  Article To Be Added </H5>
  Article...An amendment is required by adding to Chapter 1 an 
article that defines the state's political identity in light of 
the democratic option that is based on party pluralism in its 
capacity, along with the principle of the peaceful rotation of 
power, as one of the national constants that must be underlined 
in the constitution and must be bolstered with stipulations 
stated within the political principles incorporated in Article 
39 of the constitution. This amendment shall also stipulate that 
the law will define the categories of state employees who shall 
be prohibited from engaging in any party activity because the 
public interest dictates it. 
  The amendment introduced by this added article also seeks to 
enhance what is already stated in the political parties and 
organizations law about the impermissibility of exploiting 
public jobs or public funds to serve the interest of a certain 
political party or organization. The amendment also seeks to 
establish this impermissibility as a constitutional principle 
and as one of the state's fundamental principles so as to 
strengthen the democratic system and party pluralism; to ensure 
the safety and neutrality of public jobs; and to protect public 
money. In order to achieve this end, the text of the amendment 
must be binding to all agencies, parties, and officials in the 
various positions of responsibility. 
<H5>  Chapter 2 </H5>
<H5>  Economic Fundamentals </H5>
  Article 6. It is required to rephrase this article in order 
to clarify the economic tendency so that the state's economic 
policy will be founded on a free economic activity that doesn't 
undermine society's interest; so that national independence will 
be strengthened; and so that all interests will be tended and 
balanced. To accomplish this end, clear and harmonious 
principles based on the following tendencies have to be embraced: 
  A. Islamic social justice in economic relations with the aim 
of achieving social solidarity and balance, developing and 
improving production, and enhancing society's living standard. 
  B. Apply the rule of profitability to economic and 
production 
activities managed by the public sector, considering that these 
activities are tantamount to a public social property that must 
be managed according to economic and commercial criteria. This 
is accomplished by adopting the principle of legitimate 
competition which ensures fair cooperation between the various 
economic activity sectors and makes sure that these sectors are 
treated equally and fairly. 
  C. Protect and preserve private ownership so it will not be 
undermined, unless for the sake of a public interest and only 
with fair compensation in accordance with the law. 
  Article 7. It is required to amend this article in order to 
eliminate the ambiguity engulfing the word "derivatives." This 
word should be replaced by "kinds" because derivatives come into 
existence after natural resources are discovered and produced. 
  Article 8. It is required to rephrase this article in order 
to eliminate the restriction it contains regarding public 
institutions and public resources. It is required that the 
state's general plan be established with a comprehensive view of 
all of society's resources. The cooperative sector should be 
included as one of the sectors which, as stipulated by this 
article, must be developed and enhanced through the state's 
economic policy. 
  Article 9. It is required to amend this article to make it 
compatible with free economic activity so that the government 
role will be to tend and encourage rather than to direct and 
control, which are incompatible with the principle of free 
economy. Free economic activity shouldn't be restricted, unless 
it undermines society's interest. The amendment should also 
state that monopoly, which is harmful to society, is prohibited. 
The amendment should also seek to encourage private capital to 
invest in the various areas of economic and social development. 
  Article 15. It is required to amend this article so as to 
make a distinction between contracts on the utilization of 
natural resources which, as stipulated by the article, must be 
concluded by law, and concession contracts connected with public 
utilities. It is difficult to conclude the latter contracts by 
law in every case because they take many and varied forms and 
because most of them are small contracts, such contracts to 
manage rural water projects, a park, or a school cafeteria. 
Therefore, the text should state that these contracts shall be 
concluded in accordance with the law and not by a law. 
  In addition to the articles that are required to be amended 
in this chapter in the manner demonstrated above, amendment 
should also be made through the addition of a number of articles 
to Chapter 2 so as to deal with the deficiency from which the 
current constitution suffers in a number of important areas 
connected with economic components for which no provisions 
exists. These amendments should be included in five articles 
that deal with the following issues: 

  -  article...concerning the inviolability and protection of 
public property. 
  -  article...to ban the confiscation of public property and to 
require a court decision for the confiscation of private 
property. 
  -  article...on alms tax as one of the resources which the 
government must collect and which it must spend for purposes 
specified by the shari'ah. 
  -  article...to underline the inviolability of awqaf [religious 
trusts] and to improve their resources and spend them in a 
manner that ensures achievement of the objectives and goals of 
these trusts as specified by the shari'ah, thus ensuring that 
they perform their role in development in accordance with the 
shari'ah. 
<H5>  Chapter 3 </H5>
<H5>  Social and Cultural Fundamentals </H5>
  Article 12. Because various provisions of the constitution 
state explicitly that numerous relations and activities shall be 
regulated by the law, it is extremely important that a provision 
be added to this article of the constitution to stipulate that 
the law shall regulate unionist and and professional activity 
and relations between labor and work owners so as to ensure that 
these relations are founded on an economic basis that observes 
the rules of social justice. 
  Because there is an evident deficiency in this chapter 
regarding a number of important social components that are 
compatible with the principles of Islam and the principles and 
objectives of the Yemeni revolution and that reaffirm the noble 
values which have been ingrained in the Yemeni society's 
conscience throughout its life and development, the constitution 
must incorporate and confirm these components in articles that 
should be added to this chapter as follows: 

  -  an article stipulating that the Yemeni society is based on 
a social solidarity founded on justice, freedom, and equality; 
  -  an article on family as the basis of society and on religion, 
morals, and love of the country as the mainstays of both family 
and society; 
  -  an article on the government's role in protecting maternity 
and 
childhood; 
  -  an article on education, health, and social services as 
mainstays of society's structure and progress and on the 
government's and society's role in providing them; 
  -  an article on the role of women in society; 
  -  an article on natural disasters and general catastrophes and 
the need to ensure that the government, in solidarity with 
society, shoulders the burdens emanating from them; 
  -  an article on the government's preservation of historical 
antiquities and on cooperation by the citizens with the 
government to incriminate those who undermine the inviolability 
of antiquities. 
<H5>  Chapter 4 </H5>
<H5>  Fundamentals of National Defense </H5>
  Article 21. So that the ban stated in the text of the 
article 
on the formation of military or paramilitary organizations by 
any circle or group may include political parties and 
organizations, it is extremely important to amend the article by 
inserting into it an addition to make it state that the ban 
includes the formation of any military or para- military 
organization by any political party or organization for any 
purpose and under any name whatsoever. 
  Article 25. The subject of amendment in this article should 
focus on clearly defining the police's relationship with the 
judiciary authority, on eliminating the ambiguity as to who 
controls the police, and on requiring the police to adhere to 
orders issued to them by the judiciary authority in accordance 
with the law. 
  Article...The national interest dictates that an article be 
added to this chapter to underline the armed forces' neutrality 
in order to reflect their embodiment of the national unity, to 
prevent their exploitation for the interests of any party, 
individual, or faction, and to protect them from all forms of 
discrimination. 
<H6>  Section 2 </H6>
<H6>  Citizens' Fundamental Rights and Duties </H6>
  The amendment's main tendency in this regard is to replace 
some words or phrases over which there has been controversy 
because their indications have been understood vaguely by some 
people. Because of the confusion created by this vague 
understanding and in order to settle the controversy, it is 
necessary to replace these words and phrases by other words or 
phrases that serve the purpose clearly and in a manner that 
leaves no place for ambiguity and that creates no verbal 
controversy. The amendments should be as follows: 

  -  Article 27. It is required to amend this article so that 
it will stipulate that all citizens are equal in public rights 
and duties and that the state may not discriminate or make 
distinctions in human rights because of sex, color, origin, 
language, profession, social status, or religion. 
  -  Article 31. This article should be amended by replacing the 
phrase "by law" with the phrase "in accordance with the word 
of...." This article should be rephrased so that it will make it 
clearly understood that no penal law may be issued with a 
retroactive effect. 
  -  Article 32. It is required to amend this article so as to 
eliminate the contradiction in some of its paragraphs, to 
achieve a clearer and more realistic definition of the 
authorities concerned, to underline the public prosecution's 
authority to keep somebody detained for a maximum period of 
seven days, and to make the law spell out the maximum duration 
of precautionary detention. 
  -  Article 33. It is required that this article be amended so 
that 
any ambiguity regarding its intent will be eliminated. Amendment 
should be done by rephrasing the article to make it clear that 
its intent is to ensure that the execution of penalties is 
carried out with proper means and that no laws to the contrary 
may be passed. 
  -  Article 37. It is required to amend this article by adding to 
it a provision stating that education shall be compulsory in the 
basic phase and that the state shall exert efforts to eliminate 
illiteracy and to expand technical and vocational education. 
  In a related area, some provisions must be added to some 
articles of this section of the constitution in order to fill 
the gap it contains and to underline a number of the citizen's 
fundamental rights that haven't been stipulated by this 
constitution and that are no less important than the right to 
education, which is stipulated by the constitution. 
  These rights must be stipulated by amendments that add to 
this Section 4 articles that cover the following: 

  -  an article that ensures the right to defense directly or 
indirectly throughout the phases of interrogation and litigation 
before all courts and that makes certain that the state provides 
legal aid to those who are financially incapable; 
  -  an article on the right of all citizens to health care--an 
article that calls for a law to regulate the medical profession, 
for expanding free medical services, and for spreading health 
awareness; 
  -  an article to ensure that the government provides the 
citizens 
with social guarantees in cases of sickness, disability, 
unemployment, and old age, as well as guarantees for martyrs' 
families; 
  -  an article on the citizens' right to vote, to run for 
election, 
and to express their opinion in referendums. The law should 
regulate the rules governing the exercise of this right. 
  Considering that this chapter is concerned in the first 
place 
with the citizens' fundamental rights and duties and that the 
constitution has failed to define the citizens' fundamental 
duties in this same section, amendment should be made by adding 
three articles on the following: 

  -  an article on the duty to pay taxes and public costs in 
accordance with the law; 
  -  an article on the duty to perform the national defense 
service 
[military service], which is regulated by the law; 
  -  an article on the duty to preserve national unity, to protect 
state secrets, and to respect laws and abide by their provisions. 
<H6>  Section 3 </H6>
<H6>  Regulation of State Authority </H6>
  It is important to point out that the title of this section 
as it is currently found in the constitution has the word state 
"authority" and not state "authorities." This section 
incorporates four chapters that regulate the state authorities, 
which are embodied in the House of Representatives, the 
Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and local 
government agencies. The section does not include the powers of 
the judiciary authority as one of the state's three main 
authorities. Rather, a separate section, namely Section 4 which 
is entitled "The Judiciary and Public Prosecution," has been set 
aside for this authority under a title which gives the 
impression that it is no more than a service utility. It is 
evident from this that Section 3 regulates several state 
authorities and not just one authority, as implied by its 
current title. Moreover, the provisions concerning the judiciary 
are listed in Section 4, which means that this authority is not 
considered one of the state authorities. This position clearly 
reflects the totalitarian conditions and concepts which existed 
under the partitioned Yemen and which did not acknowledge the 
principle of plurality of powers and of their separation. There 
is no doubt that this position has reflected negatively on the 
content of a number of the constitutional provisions, especially 
in this regard, considering that these provisions are either 
vague, two-sided, or deficient. This is a normal outcome of the 
balancing approach which governed the method that was used to 
draft the constitution under the conditions of a partitioned 
Yemen. Were it not for the collective sense of national 
responsibility which the entire political leadership has 
displayed in dealing with state affairs and with the 
authorities' relations with each other, numerous dangers and 
crisis would have surfaced and it would have been difficult to 
obviate their consequences and ramifications. This is one of the 
fundamental motives and justifications for the endeavor to amend 
the constitution. The constitutional provisions regulating the 
state authorities must be clear and specific in a manner that 
does not permit duality in powers and authorities and that does 
not allow the undermining of one authority vis-a-vis the other 
authorities. These provisions must leave no place for the 
inability to determine accountability or to prevent overlapping 
in the authorities' exercise of their powers so they can make it 
easy to determine the areas of integration or cooperation 
between the authorities. Obviation of the negatives existing in 
the constitutional provisions and the likely future perils of 
these negatives cannot be just left up to the patriotism of the 
people in charge of the various authorities and to their assumed 
wisdom in dealing with issues. It is a national duty to draft 
constitutional provisions that regulate the state authorities 
precisely so that we can have a firm and clear base for the 
future; can ensure, cement, and protect the country's gains; and 
can move forward with firm steps to achieve our people's 
legitimate aspirations. 
  Before we deal with the main amendment tendencies concerning 
each chapter of this section separately and before we tackle the 
articles that need to be amended, which will be listed later, we 
will review briefly here the structural composition of the state 
institutions which the amendment seeks to establish so that 
components of Section 3 will be as follows: 
<H5>  Chapter 1 </H5>
<H5>  Legislative Authority: House of Representatives </H5>
  Article 40. The amendment listed for this article is as 
follows: 
  1. The word "approve" should replace the word "decide" 
because this is compatible with the house jurisdiction, 
considering that the word "decide" signifies drafting and 
preparing more than it signifies giving approval. 
  2. The word "guidance," which precedes the phrase "and 
control" should be abolished, considering that the House of 
Representatives is concerned with legislation and control. The 
constitution defines the means of constitutional control to 
which the house is entitled and which are embodied in: 
ratification of treaties and agreements (Article 48); approval 
of the state's final account (Article 49); approval of the state 
budget (Article 50); approval of the transfer of any sum of 
money from one section of the general budget to another and of 
any expenditure not listed in the budget or exceeding the 
estimates (Article 51); approval of the law which determines 
provisions of the public establishments and organizations 
budget, of their accounts, and of the independent budgets and 
their final accounts (Article 52); and the right to offer 
directions, meaning recommendations, to the government on public 
issues. It is then the government's duty to explain to the house 
why it cannot implement the recommendations, if it cannot 
implement them (Article 68). 
  The house is entitled, if 20 percent of its members so 
request, to hold a general debate and to query the government 
policy on any public issue and to exchange ideas on it (Article 
69). The house is also entitled to form a special fact-finding 
committee or to assign one of its committees as a fact-finding 
committee to investigate issues in numerous areas and with broad 
powers (Article 70). The house is also empowered to approve 
public economic and social development plans by a law. At the 
same time, the house passes the law that defines how plans shall 
be drafted and presented to it (Article 71). On top of all of 
this, the house grants the government the vote of confidence 
(Article 72) and is entitled to withdraw it from the government 
(Article 73). The house is also empowered to refer the prime 
minister, his deputies, and ministers to the courts (Article 
111). Every house member is entitled, moreover, to query and 
question [the government] and to propose laws and law 
amendments. All these are constitutional control instruments. 
Even if a small part of them is used well, it will be beneficial 
to the country, the people, and the country. This is why it is 
better not to keep the word "guidance" or to cling to it. Its 
presence serves no purpose. All this word does is arouse futile 
debate and conflicting ideas that contradict the constitutional 
structure and the principle of the separation of powers. 
  Article 42. The amendment listed for this article is as 
follows: 
  1. Provision (3) of Paragraph (B), which merely stipulates 
that a candidate running for election to the House of 
Representatives shall not be illiterate, must be replaced by the 
requirement that a candidate must master reading and writing so 
that the house can achieve greater efficiency. 
  2. Add to the prerequisites the requirement that a candidate 
running for election to the House of Representatives must 
observe the religious rites and must not have been convicted of 
the crime of violating honor and trust, unless rehabilitated. 
The objective is to underline the important aspects of good 
conduct and behavior and to encourage those who wish to run for 
election to the house to behave accordingly. 
  Article 46. It is required to amend this article so as end 
dual jurisdiction over election disputations, listed as 
jurisdiction that belongs to the Supreme Court. This amendment 
should be made by either abolishing the article or by rephrasing 
it. 
  Article 48. It is required to amend this article by 
rephrasing it to define clearly and precisely the issues which 
have to be approved by the House of Representatives so as to 
steer away from the inapplicable generalization of the current 
article. What should be approved by the House of Representatives 
are: treaties and agreements connected with defense, alliances, 
peace, or border modification; treaties and agreements that 
result in financial obligations to the state; and treaties and 
agreements which require that a law be issued for their 
implementation. 
<H5>  [13 Sep, p 6] </H5>
  [Text] Following are the main tendencies of the amendment 
needed for each chapter of this section separately, according to 
the classification noted above, as well as the articles required 
to be amended within each chapter: 
<H6>  Section 3 </H6>
<H6>  Regulation of State Authorities </H6>
<H5>  Chapter 1 </H5>
<H5>  Legislative Authority: House of Representatives </H5>
  Article 40. The amendment listed for this article is the 
following: 
  1. The word "approve" should replace the word "decide" 
because this word is compatible with the house jurisdiction, 
considering that the word "decide" signifies drafting and 
preparing more than it signifies just approval. 
  2. The word "guidance," which precedes the phrase "and 
control," should be abolished, considering that the House of 
Representatives is concerned with legislation and control. The 
constitution defines the means of constitutional control to 
which the house is entitled and which are embodied in: 
ratification of treaties and agreements (Article 48); approval 
of the state's final account (Article 49); approval of the state 
budget (Article 50); approval of the transfer of any sum of 
money from one section of the general budget to another and 
approval of any expenditure not listed in the budget or 
exceeding the estimates (Article 51); approval of the law which 
determines provisions of the budget of public establishments and 
organizations, approval of these organizations' accounts, and 
approval of independent budgets and their final accounts 
(Article 52); and the right to offer directions, meaning 
recommendations, to the government on public issues. It is the 
government's duty to explain to the house why it cannot 
implement the recommendations, if it cannot recommend them 
(Article 68). 
  The house is entitled, if 20 percent of its member so 
request, to hold a general debate and to query the government 
policy on any public issue and to exchange views on such a 
policy (Article 69). The house is also entitled to form a 
fact-finding committee or to assign one of its committees to 
investigate issues in numerous areas and with broad powers 
(Article 70). The house is, moreover, empowered to approve 
public economic and social development plans by law. At the same 
time, the house passes the law that determines how plans shall 
be drafted and presented to it (Article 71). On top of all of 
this, the House of Representatives grants the government its 
vote of confidence (Article 72), and it is entitled to withdraw 
this confidence from the government (Article 73). The house is 
empowered to refer the prime minister, his deputies, and 
ministers to the courts (Article 111). Every house member is 
entitled, moreover, to question and query and to propose laws 
and law amendments. All these are constitutional control 
instruments. Even if a small part of them is used well, it will 
be beneficial to the country and the people. This is why it is 
better not to keep the word "guidance" or to cling to it. Its 
presence serves no purpose. All this word does is arouse futile 
debate and conflicting ideas that contradict the constitutional 
structure and the principle of the separation of powers. 
  Article 42. The amendment listed for this article is as 
follows: 
  1. Provision (3) of Paragraph B, which merely stipulates 
that 
a candidate running for election to the House of Representatives 
shall not be illiterate, must be replaced by the requirement 
that a candidate must master reading and writing so that the 
house can achieve greater efficiency. 
  2. Add to the prerequisites the requirement that a candidate 
running for election to the House of Representatives must 
observe the religious rites and that he must not have been 
convicted of the crime of violating honor and trust, unless 
rehabilitated. The objective is to underline the important 
aspects of good conduct and behavior and to encourage those who 
wish to run for election to the house to behave accordingly. 
  Article 46. It is required to amend this article so as to 
end 
the dual jurisdiction over election disputations, listed as 
jurisdiction belonging to the the Supreme Court. This amendment 
should be achieved by either abolishing the article or by 
rephrasing it. 
  Article 48. It is required to amend this article by 
rephrasing it to define clearly and precisely issues which have 
to be approved by the House of Representatives so as to steer 
away from the inapplicable generalizations of this article. What 
should be approved by the House of Representatives are: treaties 
and agreements connected with defense, alliances, peace, or 
border modification; treaties and agreements that result in 
financial obligations to the state; and treaties and agreements 
which require that a law be issued for their implementation. 
  Article 50. The amendment listed for this article is purely 
formal. It calls for dividing the article into two paragraphs, 
making the final sentence of the article an independent 
paragraph, listed as paragraph B. What precedes this paragraph 
will be listed under paragraph A. This is because even though 
the final sentence is short, it encompasses several important 
provisions that are distinctive from the rest of the article. 
  Article 52. The amendment listed for this article calls for 
adding the word "otherwise" before the phrase "shall be subject 
to the provisions...." The purpose is to phrase this article 
precisely. The fact that this word is missing in the article 
negates the justification for the entire article because the 
main purpose of this article is to have the law establish 
special provisions for the budgets and accounts of public 
authorities and establishments, and for independent and attached 
budgets and their final accounts. This is what justifies 
creating these authorities and establishments and making them 
financial accountability independent of that of the state. The 
provisions governing the general budget and its final account 
will thus become the general rule where no special provisions 
exist. 
  Article 54. The amendment listed for this article seeks an 
effective structure of the house leadership by stipulating that 
this leadership should consist of a speaker and three 
representatives who constitute the House of Representatives 
Office. The amendment also stipulates that the house shall have 
a general secretariat headed by a general secretary, provided 
that the house bylaws spell out the provisions concerning 
formation of the secretariat and other related provisions. 
  Article 57. The amendment listed for this article seeks to 
ensure complete clarity and absence of duality regarding 
convocation of the house's ordinary and special sessions. It 
stipulates that the house shall convene two ordinary sessions. 
It makes it permissible, meanwhile, for the house to convene 
special sessions on a decree issued by the president at his own 
wish or in response to the written request of the house office 
or of one third the house membership. It also stipulates that 
the session convened in the final quarter of the year shall not 
be adjourned until the general state budget is passed. This 
determination is very important for making the house efficient, 
considering that the current text is deficient and that past 
experience convinces one that this amendment is necessary. 
  Article 66. To ensure that the House of Representatives 
member is effective and that the house membership rises to the 
level of the house's immense responsibility and the level of the 
voters' good opinion of the house, the amendment listed for this 
article focuses on making a member's serious violation of his 
membership duties, as defined by the house bylaws, a reason that 
makes it permissible to drop his membership. One should keep in 
mind that the constitution empowers the house to draft its 
bylaws in accordance with the text of Article 45 of the 
constitution. 
  Article 67. The amendment listed for this article seeks the 
following: 
  1. Omit the power granted to unions and mass organizations 
to 
propose, through their representatives, draft laws or law 
amendments because this is in violation of the character of the 
House of Representatives member as a general representative of 
all the people and because this stipulation is incompatible with 
the reality, considering that there are no House of 
Representatives members who represent unions of specific 
organizations directly. 
  2. To ensure that no bills to increase, abolish, or reduce 
taxes, to lower some taxes, or to allocate a part of the state 
funds for a certain project are initiated, the amendment 
requires that such such bills be presented by the government or 
by one-fourth the house members. For further clarity, the 
phrasing should be amended to state explicitly that a law 
proposal may be submitted by one or more members of the House of 
Representatives. 
  Article 68. It is required to amend this bill by replacing 
the word "directives," which occurs twice in the article, by the 
word "recommendations" because the word recommendations is 
compatible with the principle of the separation of powers that 
is founded on cooperation and integration. The purpose is to 
eliminate the word "directives" as a cause of controversy over 
whether the word signifies or does not signify the separation of 
powers. If the word "directives" is understood to be binding, 
then it means that there is no separation of powers. Such an 
understanding is incompatible with the powers and other control 
instruments granted to the house but is compatible with the 
totalitarian system, as we have pointed out in connection with 
the amendment concerning Article 40. 
  Article 72. It is required to amend this article by adding 
to 
it a phrase that clarifies what is meant by the phrase 
"government program," which is mentioned in the text of the 
article, and to eliminate the ambiguity engulfing this program. 
The phrase that is required to be added is "which defines the 
broad lines of the domestic and foreign policy." To eliminate 
any future ambiguity or controversy, the word "program" should 
replace the word "statement" which occurs in the article. 
  Article 77. The majority of the provisions of this article 
repeat provisions already stated in Article 55 of the 
constitution. It is required to rephrase this article so that 
this repetition will be eliminated. The amendment should also 
state that a final vote shall be taken on every draft law and 
that the house bylaws shall determine the relevant procedures. 
  Article 78. The amendment seeks to fill the gap existing in 
the article regarding the practical procedures that have to be 
established in case it is planned to dissolve the house--such as 
procedures that set the period during which elections have to be 
held and that suspend house sessions until results of the next 
election appear. It is very important to regulate these aspects 
so that lack of provision will not be a cause for offhandedness 
or conflict. 
  In a related area, the amendment needed for this article 
should not require that the cabinet resign before an election 
because the election is supervised by an independent and neutral 
committee, namely the Higher Election Committee. The cabinet has 
no role in the election. 
  Article 79. The amendment focuses on adding a provision on 
the consequence of the president's nonpromulgation of a law when 
the constitutional period for the president to return the law to 
the house has expired or when a law has been returned to the 
house and passed again. The consequence should be that the law 
has been issued by the force of the constitution without the 
need for it to be promulgated. The law should be published in 
the Official Gazette immediately and should be enacted two weeks 
after its publication. 
  (Added) article. To eliminate any confusion regarding the 
permissibility or impermissibility of combining House of 
Representatives membership with other jobs, it is proposed that 
an amendment be made in this regard by adding an article that 
incorporates contents of the provision stipulated in the current 
general election law. The added article should read as follows: 
  Article...on...It is impermissible to combine House of 
Representatives membership with membership in a local council or 
with any public job. As an exception, it is permissible to 
combine House of Representatives membership with cabinet 
membership. 
<H5>  Chapter 2 </H5>
<H5>  Executive Authority </H5>
  The executive authority consists of the presidency and the 
government. Because the president of the republic is the head of 
state and the top of the executive authority at the same time, 
this chapter will be divided into two branches: the first is the 
presidency of the republic and the second is the government. 
<H5>  First Branch </H5>
<H5>  Presidency of the Republic </H5>
  Determining the shape of the presidency is one of the most 
important issues with which amendment must deal as part of the 
effort to organize the state authorities in a manner which 
ensures ideal stability that agrees with the givens of the age, 
that is compatible with the real situation, and that is in 
harmony with the human experience. 
  In accordance with the constitution, the presidency of the 
state is currently based on the principle of collective 
leadership, which is embodied in the Presidential Council. This 
principle, like others contained in the constitution, reflects 
the political, cultural, and social environment which was 
created and defined by the extraordinary factors and conditions 
of a partitioned Yemen under which the constitution was drafted. 
The principle of collective leadership or of partnership in the 
presidency of the state was one of the compromises made at the 
time to overcome those conditions. It was a compromise made from 
the perspective of serving the conflicting political and 
organizational positions and tendencies of the two previous 
regimes, not from the perspective of what is dictated by the 
national interest and what embodies unity of the Yemeni people, 
thus making the presidency of the state harmonious with the 
people's unity and with democracy. 
  Now that the people's great historical dream of regaining 
their unity has been accomplished; in light of the important 
national and foreign transformations and changes that 
materialized since creation of the blessed Republic of Yemen, 
changes and transformations that are different in form and 
essence from the circumstances and conditions under which the 
constitution was drafted; and to strengthen the mainstays of 
unity and stability, the current form of presidency of the state 
must be reexamined and restructured so that the powers of the 
presidency, i.e., the "head of state," will be exercised by the 
president of the republic and so that the president will have a 
vice president. This means a change from collective leadership 
of the presidency of the republic, which is embodied in the 
Presidential Council, to another form that has prevailed in the 
world throughout history and in today's world, namely the form 
of president of the republic. 
  Organizing the presidency of the republic in the manner 
proposed above accomplishes numerous positives and eliminates 
all the faults and negatives associated with the collective 
leadership method. The most important justifications and 
considerations confirming and clarifying the soundness of 
adopting the proposed form of presidency can be summed up as 
follows: 
  1. It embodies the principle of national unity, represented 
in the president of the republic who symbolizes unity of the 
country, its sovereignty, and its independence. This is the 
system prevailing in today's world as a result of the human 
experience generally. 
  2. This form is compatible with the special characteristics 
of the Yemeni society which does not have a multiplicity of 
ethnic groups which, when they exist, are careful to be 
represented in a collective council. 
  3. As a general rule, management of the state by the 
collective leadership system is unsuccessful because it is 
engulfed in numerous negatives that weaken the movement of the 
country's higher political and economic leadership. The most 
significant of these negatives are: 
  A. The indifference and dependence that prevail in the 
collective leadership's exercise of jurisdiction and powers 
connected with the presidency of the state, the subsequent 
weakness at the control and execution level, and the negligence 
of numerous important issues. 
  B. The difference of visions and ideas for dealing with 
issues--a difference which reflects itself in the decisionmaking 
process. 
  C. Complexity of the collective leadership's work system and 
its negative impact on prompt decision making, especially on 
issues and subjects that cannot be delayed. 
  D. The multiplicity, confusion, and contradiction of 
directives issued by the collective leadership members, and the 
subsequent confusion they cause the administrative process. 
  E. A collective leadership's members often stay on the 
peripheries of a productive practical life and far from action 
in the central executive authority because of their equal status 
as collective leadership members and because they are tied down, 
at the same time, by regular meetings. 
  In light of the above, it is necessary to rephrase and 
reorganize articles of the second chapter that need to be 
amended in a manner compatible with the fundamental tendencies 
of the proposed amendments for the first branch of Chapter 2. 
  It is also normal that when the required amendment 
concerning 
the form of presidency of the state is passed, the phrase 
"presidential council" will be automatically replaced by the 
phrase "president of the republic" wherever it occurs in the 
constitution. In the article concerning the vice president, it 
should be stipulated that the provisions of Articles 85, 86, 88, 
89, 90, 92, 93, and 101 will be applied in this regard. 
  Following are the articles required to be amended: 
  Article 82. It should be amended to read that the presidency 
of the republic, i.e., "chairmanship of the state, shall be 
exercised by the president of the republic, who is the head of 
state and who shall be elected in accordance with the 
constitution. The president shall have a vice president, shall 
select his vice president, and shall announce his name so he 
will be known before the general presidential election is held. 
  Article 83. It should be amended so that nomination of the 
candidates for president and vice president will be as follows: 
  1. The president of the republic shall be elected by the 
people in a competitive election. 
  2. Nominations shall be presented to the House of 
Representatives. 
  3. Nominations shall be examined by the House of 
Representatives speakership to make sure that candidates meet 
the constitutional prerequisites. 
  4. The names of candidates who meet the prerequisites shall 
be submitted to the House of Representatives for approval. 
  5. Any nominee gaining the approval of 10 percent of the 
House of Representatives shall be considered a candidate for 
presidency of the republic. 
  6. To ensure that the election is competitive, the House of 
Representatives shall be required to name at least two persons 
to run for the position of president of the republic prior to 
presenting the candidates to the people for a competitive 
election. 
  7. The candidate gaining an absolute majority of the votes 
of 
those who take part in the election shall be the president of 
the republic. If no candidate gains such a majority, both 
nomination and election shall be repeated in accordance with the 
aforementioned procedures. 
  Article 84. It should be amended to state that the president 
of the republic shall work to underline the people's 
sovereignty, to respect the constitution and supremacy of the 
law, to protect national unity and the principles of the Yemeni 
revolution, to tend the peaceful rotation of power, and to 
establish the bounds for the various authorities so as to ensure 
that they perform their roles. 
  Article 85. It should be amended to state that every Yemeni 
who meets the established prerequisites is fit and entitled to 
run for election to the position of president of the republic. 
An amendment should be made to require that a candidate's 
[minimum] age must be 40 and that a candidate must not be 
married to a foreigner, must not marry a foreigner during his 
term, must be of upright conduct and character, and must observe 
the religious rites. 
  Article 87. It should be amended by adding to it a provision 
that limits the president and the vice president to just two 
five-year terms. 
  Article 91. It should be amended by adding to it a provision 
stating that the vice president shall replace the president for 
a period of no more than 60 days in case the president's 
position becomes vacant. New presidential elections should be 
held during the aforementioned period. In case the vice 
president's position becomes vacant, the president should select 
a vice president and submit his name to the House of 
Representatives for approval. 
  Article 98. It should be amended with a provision which 
states that the president and the vice president shall exercise 
the executive power on behalf of the people within the bounds 
stipulated by the constitution. The amendment is required to 
fill a noticeable deficiency in this regard and because the 
justification for the existing provision that concerns the form 
of the presidency will have ended, considering that it is 
proposed to amend this form. 
  Article 99. It should be amended to state that the president 
of the republic is the supreme commander of the armed forces. 
This amendment is required in order to fill a noticeable 
deficiency in this regard, considering that this command is 
underlined in the National Defense Council law and the military 
service law and that this provision is a given in the various 
constitutional systems. 
  In addition to the articles in this chapter that need to be 
amended in the aforementioned manner, whether in content or form 
or whether by replacement, the public interest dictates that the 
following three articles be added to this chapter: 
  Article...The president shall be assisted in his duties by 
the vice president, and he may delegate some of his powers to 
the vice president. 
  Article...An advisory council comprised of experts and 
specialized capabilities shall be formed to expand the base of 
participation with opinion and to organize utilization of the 
accumulated national capabilities and expertise. The law shall 
determine the provisions concerning the council. 
  An article to prevent carrying out death sentences, unless 
approved by the president of the republic: The president of the 
republic shall be empowered (except in cases of religious 
punishment) to pardon or reduce the punishment. A general 
amnesty shall be by law only. 
  All constitutions agree to tie this provision, which 
requires 
the president's approval for the execution of a death sentence, 
to the head of state. The same thing applies to tying a general 
amnesty to the law. 
<H5>  Second Branch </H5>
<H5>  The Government (Council of Ministers) </H5>
  In the skeletal structure of state authorities, the 
government represents the second branch of the executive 
authority. This is its normal status. The provisions concerning 
the government are listed in Chapter 3 of the constitution. This 
gives the impression that the government is an authority that is 
far from the state presidency whereas most articles of the 
various chapters of the constitution contain explicit and 
specific provisions concerning the status of the government as a 
higher state executive and administrative authority. The 
president of the republic supervises the formation of this 
authority and its performance of its duties; controls its 
activities; and brings its members to account. This authority is 
also subject to the control of and accountable before the House 
of Representatives. According to the structure of state 
authorities that has just been presented, inclusion of the 
provisions pertaining to the government in a branch within the 
chapter on the executive authority will set matters right, will 
accomplish the required clarity in the structure of the 
constitutional institutions, and will regulate relations between 
these institutions. 
  The above reflects the main tendency concerning 
classification and the indications emanating from 
classification. As for articles that are required to be amended 
within the framework of this branch, they are the following: 
  Article 103. The constitution is the law which defines 
fundamentally the powers of the Council of Ministers, the prime 
minister, and the ministers. Therefore, there is no place for a 
special law to define these powers. However, there is nothing to 
prevent laws from stipulating that special tasks or powers may 
be assigned to the Council of Minister, the prime minister, or 
the ministers, depending on the nature of the issues with which 
each law deals separately and on what is dictated by the nature 
of the activity exercised by each minister. It is extremely 
difficult for one law to encompass the powers of the ministers 
that are scattered in various laws. But on the other hand, it is 
logical that the law should spell out the general rules for 
organizing cabinet ministries, the various state agencies, and 
public establishments and companies. But to define the powers of 
cabinet ministries and their outfits by law is extremely 
difficult. It is difficult practically and in terms of the sound 
concept of administrative reform and of what is dictated by the 
science of administration. This science requires reasonable 
flexibility in organization and modernization, which are 
tantamount to an ongoing and ever-renewed process that is 
governed by the general organizational principles determined by 
the law. Therefore, the required amendment dictates that the 
legislator be content with ensuring that the law defines the 
general principles of organization, including the criteria and 
controls that must be observed in organizing the cabinet 
ministries, establishments, and other administrative divisions. 
The law must also define the other legislative instruments with 
which this administrative division is accomplished. 
  Article 111. This article should be rephrased to ensure that 
the House of Representatives is empowered to refer the prime 
minister, his deputies, the ministers, or their deputies to 
interrogation and trial instead of being empowered to just 
recommend such referral and trial. The amendment should also 
make clear the natural sequence of the relevant procedures. 
  Article 113. It should be amended to empower the prime 
minister to ask the president of the republic to relieve a 
minister with whom the prime minister deems it impossible to 
cooperate. This would replace the provision stipulating that the 
prime minister merely refer the matter to the president to 
determine what he deems fit. Thus, discipline will be achieved 
at the cabinet level. 
  Article 114. It should be amended by adding to it that in 
case the House of Representatives withholds and withdraws 
confidence from the cabinet and in case a new general House of 
Representatives election is held, then the prime minister must 
submit his cabinet's resignation to the president of the 
republic. 
  Article...It is required to add an amendment to this branch 
to define the prerequisites a cabinet minister has to meet, the 
same as in the case of house members, bearing in mind that a 
cabinet member may not be less than 30 years old. 
<H5>  Third Branch </H5>
<H5>  Local Government Agencies </H5>
  The main amendment tendencies in this connection--in 
addition 
to the new classification which will put this authority under 
the Third Branch instead of Chapter 4, thus making it harmonious 
with the aforementioned skeletal structure of the constitutional 
institutions-- focus on adding some provisions to fill the 
deficiencies in some aspects and to expand the powers of local 
councils, considering that they are an indivisible part of the 
state authority. The amendment tendencies also focus on 
rearranging some paragraphs within the articles of this chapter 
as follows: 
  Article 117. It should be amended by adding to it a 
provision 
so the law will indicate how the heads of administrative units 
are selected and so it will state on what scientific principles 
and criteria administrative division is founded. Two paragraphs 
in this article should be transferred to Article 119. 
  Article 118. It should be amended to state clearly that 
governorate and district councils shall be elected in a general 
and free direct referendum. The amendment should also expand 
these councils' powers in the areas of public services, of 
proposing programs, plans, and budgets for the administrative 
unit, and of supervising and bringing to account local 
government agencies in accordance with the law. The amendment 
should also adopt decentralized administration as a basis for 
the local government system. 
  Article 119. It should be amended by adding to its beginning 
some provisions transferred from Article 119 because this would 
be the natural place for these provisions. The phrase "president 
of the republic" should be added next to the phrase "Council of 
Ministers" in connection with the accountability of governors. 
  Article...An amendment is required by adding an article to 
this branch on promoting and nurturing cooperative development 
bodies in the administrative units, considering that they are 
among the most important instruments of local development. 
<H5>  Chapter 3 </H5>
<H5>  The Judiciary Authority </H5>
  In harmony with the main amendment tendencies that seek to 
clarify the skeletal structure of the constitutional state 
institutions, amendment seems to be most urgently needed in the 
judiciary authority, whether in terms of classification or of 
the name under which the judiciary authority is listed. It is 
noticed that in the current classification of the constitution, 
the judiciary authority is not considered one of the state 
authorities included in Section 3. A subsequent section, i.e., 
Section 4, has been set aside for this authority. This 
classification gives the impression that this authority is just 
a service utility. The title of this section, namely, "The 
Judiciary and Public Prosecution," creates confusion. Therefore, 
the normal thing is to classify the articles governing the 
judiciary authority under Section 3. In the new tendency, this 
section is entitled "Organization of the State Authorities." 
Chapter 3 of this section should be devoted to this authority 
and should be entitled "The Judiciary Authority." On the one 
hand, this title is compatible with the conventional well-known 
division of state authorities and, on the other hand, it 
eliminates the confusion created by the current title in 
connection with the judiciary authority's unity. 
  In addition to the aforementioned amendment concerning 
classification and title, the main amendment tendencies focus on 
achieving greater guarantees of independence for the judiciary 
and on eliminating the duality and overlapping connected with 
supervision over the judiciary, as well as the subsequent 
negatives emanating from this duality and overlapping. These 
guarantees are achieved as follows: 
  Article 120. It should be amended to stipulate that courts 
shall have the power to settle all disputes. It should also 
state explicitly that it is not permissible to grant judiciary 
powers to any authorities other than the courts, thus 
reinforcing the original provision in Article 121 which 
prohibits setting up special courts under any circumstances. 
  Article 123. It should be amended to strengthen the 
judiciary's independence by granting the Supreme Judiciary 
Council the power to study and pass the judiciary budget prior 
to its inclusion as one figure in the state's general budget. 
  Article 124. It should be amended in a manner that does not 
undermine the judiciary's unity by providing for the presence of 
a single supreme court in the republic. But this should not 
prevent the presence of specialized courts, including 
administrative courts which are specialized in settling 
administrative disputes and disciplinary court cases, in order 
to ensure the supremacy of the principle of legitimacy and to 
emphasize judiciary control over the administration's activities. 
  To safeguard this [control], the required amendment should 
include the Supreme Court's powers, adding to them the power to 
interpret laws and to try the president of the republic, the 
vice president, the prime minister and his deputies, and the 
ministers and their deputies. 
  The numbers used to enumerate paragraphs shall be replaced 
by 
letters of the alphabet so as to make them compatible with the 
various articles of the constitution. Paragraph 3 formerly C in 
the proposed amendment, on election disputations shall be 
amended to ensure that its objective is achieved and that 
duality of power over these disputations will be eliminated. 
<H6>  Section 5 </H6>
<H6>  Principles of Constitutional Amendment and General Rules </H6>
  In light of the aforementioned proposal to amend the 
classification concerning the judiciary authority so that it 
will be covered by an independent chapter in Section 3--which 
governs the organization of state authorities--instead of being 
covered, as it is currently, by provisions in Section 4, future 
amendment will change this condition, turning Section 5 into 
Section 4 and Section 6 into Section 5. This is a part of the 
main amendment tendencies in the area of form. 
  Article 129. The main tendency of the principles of 
constitutional amendment focuses on providing greater protection 
for the constitution and for tying any future amendment of the 
constitution or of its provisions to the people. The amendment 
will add a provision that states that the issue of amendment of 
the constitution shall be presented to the people under all 
circumstances so as to get their approval of such amendment 
through a general popular referendum. Thus, no amendment will 
become valid unless it gains the approval of the majority of the 
citizens who take part in the referendum and who are included in 
the voter lists. This important addition has its roots in the 
need to refer to the people for amendment of the constitution 
which was approved by a popular referendum. Therefore, amendment 
should be made with the same legislative instrument with which 
the original constitution was approved, namely public referendum. 
  Article...It is required to include a transitional provision 
concerning the president of the republic and his vice president 
in this section to stipulate that when this amendment is passed 
by the House of Representatives, the president will be elected 
by the house just once after the approval. Candidates for the 
position of president should be nominated by one-fourth the 
house members. 
  A candidate who gains the majority of the house votes will 
be 
the president. This should be done because of the lack of time 
and out of consideration for the citizens who were summoned to 
vote in a general election only recently. 
  Article...an article should be added to state that an 
independent and impartial higher committee shall supervise and 
control general elections and referendums. It should also
